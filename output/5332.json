Fear was mostly induced by\n \nother road users. Cars were blamed in 45.3 per\n \ncent of the incidents, followed by buses (14.6 per\n \ncent), vans (8.4 per cent) and other cyclists (6.4\n \nper cent). Buses make up less than 5 per cent of\n \nthe city-centre traffic but were involved in 27 per\n \ncent of the incidents rated as 'moderately to extremely\n \nthreatening' by the cyclists. \nSeventy-one per cent of the incidents took place in 'straight-ahead' situations with only 19 per cent at junctions and roundabouts…\n&#xa0;\n3.3.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDiscussion: The finding that, for this group of regular cyclists,\n \nthreatening incidents on the roads were experienced at the\n \nrate of nearly \none incident per cyclist per day cycled,\n \nsuggests that there is likely to be a considerable disincentive\n \nto cycling. \n…\n&#xa0;\nThe picture of risk derived from the diaries deviates somewhat from local accident figures. It is not clear what weight should be given \nto the official statistics on accidents as it is well accepted that cycle accidents, including those involving serious injury, are massively under-reported \n&#xa0;\nThe discrepancies between the figures obtained from the diaries and those of police record data are reminders of the subjectivity of accident notation and witness testimony. \n&#xa0;\nIf a cyclist swerves to avoid\n an unexpected pothole, an \nensuing accident\n with an offside\n vehicle could be attributed either to \ncyclist error\n, to motorist\n error or to road conditi\nons.\n&#xa0;\nThe diary figures also deviate from national accident figures produced by the Department of Transport, which give more emphasis to vehicles turning left and right, and less emphasis to parked vehicles. \n&#xa0;\nIn its document Pedal Cyclist Casualties-1, \nthe Department of Transport does warn the reader about the possible unreliability \nof their\n data due to the underreporting of cycle accidents to the police\n, which\n form the basis for their figures.  Furthermore, local figures may well differ from national fi\ngures because of variations in traffic density and type, and local provision (or lack of provision) for cyclists. Also it must be noted that the diarists in the study reported here were over 23-years-old and were experienced and regular cyclists. As such t\nhey were likely to anticipate the infamous problem areas for cyclists - that is, junctions and roundabouts. \n&#xa0;\nHowever\n \nit is possible that cycle proficiency education has overestimated \nthe risk to cyclists at intersections and roundabouts and \nunderestimated the risk in straight-ahead situations. &#xa0;Hospital-based studies of cycle accidents not only suggest a much larger number of accidents but also a different pattern of accidents than that indicated by police records. It is interesting to note that an Australian study examining the characteristics of fatal, as compared to total, bicycle accidents finds that fatal accidents are less likely to be at intersections than are non-fatal accidents.&#xa0;\n3.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe were not expecting the result concerning the locati\non of \nincidents and subsequently undertook a broader study with a balance of diarists representing a typical traffic mix.\n  \nA diary study of the risk perceptions of road users, HEALTH, RISK &amp; SOCIETY, VOL. 3, NO. 3, 2001, SISSONS JOSHI, SENIOR &amp; SMITH. pp26\n1 – 279\n&#xa0;\n3.4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n(from \nDiscussion, p 274)\nData from our previous study suggested that junctions and roundabouts were not perceived\n \nto be as numerically hazardous by the cycle diarists as would be expected from their\n \nprominence in local and national accident figures. \n&#xa0;\nA similar picture emerges from this study in which only 35.4% of incidents reported by cyclists, and 37.5% of incidents involving cyclists reported by other vehicles, occurred at junctions, excluding roundabouts. \n&#xa0;\nThis\n contrasts with Oxfordshire Road Casualty figures (Oxfordshire County Council, 1993),\n which report that 68% of cycle accidents occur at junctions. It is well known that cycle\n accidents are under-represented in accident figures (Mills, 1989)\n but we are addressing here\n the pattern rather than the absolute number of accidents. National figures (Department of\n Transport, 1992) also suggest that at least two-thirds of cycle accidents occur at junctions.\n  We suggest that these official figures almo\nst certainly relate more to the classification of\n accidents than to the nature of what is happening on the road. The police STATS 19 records\n classify an accident as occurring at a junction irrespective of whether the manoeuvre of either\n \nvehicle concerned i\nnvolved the junction or merely happened in the vicinity of a junction.\n  &#xa0;With this query in mind, we asked the Department of Transport’s Directorate of Statistics to analyse national pedal cycle casualty figures by cross-tabulating cyclists’ actions with the actions of those involved in accidents with them. Of the 25,421 cycle accidents in 1991, 13.8% involved cyclists turning right or left and a further 28.9% involved other vehicles turning right or left. This suggests that only 42.7% of cycle accidents involve turns at junctions, which is considerably closer to estimates in the diary data than the usual two-thirds figure quoted.\n The major manoeuvre of other vehicles which cyclists reported in the current study was being overtaken too closely in a straight-ahead situation. \n&#xa0;\nIt is notable that an Australian\n study, examining the characteristics of fatal as compared to total cycle accidents, finds that\n fatal accidents are less likely to be at intersections than are non-fatal accidents (Hoque,\n 1990). \n \nOur data\n also accord with the British Medical Association’s (1992) review, which\n comments that most adult cyclist fatalities are caused by a vehicle approaching from\n behind \n—which presumably includes errors in overtaking. The Highway Code (Department of\n Environmen\nt, Transport and the Regions, 1999b) inf\norms motorists that they should \n‘give\n [cyclists] at least as much room as you would give a car’ (p. 18), although the accompanying\n illustration suggests a less generous margin of overtaking than did the illustration \nin the 1993\n edition (Department \nof Transport, 1993). The cyclists in our study clearly felt that they were\n not given the margin they required by passing motor vehicles, particularly buses. It is possible\n that buses overtake cycles with no narrower a margin\n than cars do, but threaten cyclists more\n on account of their greater size. A film record would be needed to establish whether cyclists’\n perceptions of risk relate more to the size, speed or position of the passing vehicle.\n&#xa0;\n3.4.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n(from\n Conclusions Page 277)\n…\n  \nHowever, while the successful shared use of public space will depend partly on road users’\n \nattitudes and behaviour, \nit will also depend on the imaginative implementation of road design that can protect the vulnerable from the manoeuvres and speed of the less vulnerable. &#xa0;Indeed,\n \nin his analysis of accident causation, \nWagenaar (1992) points out that risk-taking behaviour \ncan be located predominantly at the strategic end of the system—that is, amongst the \ndecision makers who structure the system. This implies that the nature of the risk environment \nlies in the hands of those who plan our roads rather than those who use them. \nExperience in the Netherlands reveals the extent to which engineering solutions can provide\n \na safer space for cyclists and walker\ns\n (Preston, 1990; Tolley, 1990).\n&#xa0;\n3.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe likelihood of risk on the highway being \nlocated\n,\n significantly\n,\n as \nthe outcome of planning the road, and/or the degree to which politicians \nunderstand, \ndemand or manage the engineering outcomes is a stark conclusion \nregarding\n the risks perceived, and imposed on vulnerable road users.  \n3.5.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBut also hopeful because the production of these outcomes could be changed with rapidity.  As has been the case in Germany, the Netherlands etc.\n3.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe predominant response in our British \nexperience is twofold,\n3.6.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe pitifully small modal share taken by \ncycling\n3.6.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe belief among many people cycling that ‘defensive’ cycling has to be learnt, to cope with conditions on the road.\n3.6.2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis then has the added problem that \nthese ‘coping’ cyclists in som\ne way define how cycling should be done.  \nThis\n presents a b\narrier to using a bike for many;\n for the overwhelming majority reported in the ESPRC - UW&amp;C research, who do not expect to\n,\n and who will not\n,\n ‘battle’ with motorised traffic.\n3.6.2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor many years divisio\nn\ns\n within cycling advocacy between vehicular cyclists and those who favour better infrastructure \nare\n deeply unhelpful. Advocating for the wishes of existing cyclists, a minority outlier population, is not the way to make cycling appeal to wider swathes of \nthe population. This does of course result in a tension, as it is not unreasonable for cycling advocacy groups to represent their members, but it is a tension that can I think be fairly easily resolved. There is no need for a dichotomous approach, and it i\ns perfectly feasible to support the needs of existing cyclists while also pushing for decent infrastructure, as well as wider factors that support less confident cyclists.\n3.6.2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn practice and even with years \nof \nexperience it feels simply impossible to \ncon\nsistent\nly\n take a ‘vehicular cyclist’ approach.  I base this comment on personal experience and observation of others.  \nE.G. travelling from Paddington Station to Smithfield, and return, t\nhere are many situations where the ambiguity of the road makes it dif\nficult to avoid being in a narrow space alongside\n/between\n moving vehicles.\n3.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat is illustrated by this section is the gulf between highways practice and a highways \nenvironment where cycling is enabled by the physical environment.\n&#xa0;\n4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe thinking and presumption/expectations of much of the \nBritain \nhas been deeply \ninfluenced\n by \nthinking\n about the road environment \ndating \nfrom WW11\n, then\n the influential\n \n‘\nTraffic in Towns\n’\n report of \n‘\n63, which effectively promoted car use at the \nexpense of urban demolition, segregating motorised movement from the life of the urban area.  Residential Road Layout Guidance\n followed, ‘DB32’ of 1977 \n-\n 2007, cementing\n the idea that residential areas should be quiet and free from extraneous traffic\n using\n culs-de-sac\n.  A comforting concept but one which was both a travesty of the original Radburn, NJ, where the density is around 4 Dw\nellings\n/\nA\ncre, as well as a de-facto \neffect of\n \nlimiting\n walking \n- \nby distancing retail \nand other destinations in\nto separate ag\nglomerations;\n ma\nking\n \nbus travel difficult to support;\n and result\ning in a bleak, high-\nspeed environmen\nt in which to cycle.  The model\n presented by Stevenage and Milton Keynes \nhas\n been found not \nto \nsupport cycling because the provision is \nadded\n after\n \nlayout\n \nconcept \ndesign\n rather than \npart of\n it\n.  \n4.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA layout \nconceived \nfor \nthe \ncar\n’\ns \nconvenience whilst moving \nis most unlikely ever to be convenient or desirable for cycling whereas the ‘traditional city’ London in large part for instance, is connected and with a ch\noice of destination on offer and where the bike is frequently the most convenient and quickest travel mode\n.  The withdrawal of DB32 and \nreplacement\n by \n‘\nManual for Streets\n’ in 2007\n is an important milepost in urban design.  A connected system\n,\n where most roads will inevitably be ‘quiet’, where connectivity can reduce the need to use a car, and where the bike performs competitively in convenience and quickness, is posited in the current guidance.  But at the point of publication tw\no unfortunate \nproblems appeared:\n \n4.2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe\n Banking crisis led to house-building collapsing and thus practice and debate using the new guidance has faltered\n, and\n in addition \n4.2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe\n guidance ‘left open a door’, to the \ncontinued, \ninappropriate \nreference to\n DMRB, \n‘\nDesign Manual fo\nr Roads and Bridges\n’ \nthe Highways Agency’s \ndesign guide\n.\n  It was not until the publication of \n‘\nManual for Streets 2, wider application of the principles’ \n(\n2010\n)\n, that DMRB’s inappropriateness is substituted. \n4.2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI fear that the freely available MfS has a wide\nr distribution than the expensive MfS2.  \n4.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe consequence of the ubiquity of DMRB in practice is that thinking about users and facilities is ‘controlled’, to some significant extent, by concern over vehicular speed, volume and avoiding congestion of motor \ntraffic.  In comparison the German Roads Guidance, RASt06 (which I translated into English\n for the publisher\n) has\n,\n since the early 1980s\n,\n taken the ‘revolutionary’ view that \n‘\nthe place’ and the activities taking place alongside any road \nare\n primary conside\nration\ns\n in the road design process.  The German approach was itself heavily influenced by Dutch thinking and practice \nduring\n the 70s and in 1981 West\n \nGer\nmany \n‘adopted’ Dutch \nguidance\n as they rewrote their own \nmanual.\n4.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFollowing the Times newspaper campaign \nand the existing interest of the current Government\n,\n a range of\n new\n funding \nresources\n have been provided.  In the case of the Cycle Safety Fund I wish to adumbrate a case in Oxfordshire of quite atrocious inability to design a fitting response and worse still, being able to comprehend and react to external criticism.\n4.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHere is the body of a \nrecently published letter\n of a group of local experts: -\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe learn from Oxford Times Letters (2/01/14) that the County is pressing on with its unbelievable design for the Wootton Road roundabout, Abingdon:\n&#xa0;\nhttp://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/opinion/letters/10902309.New_cycle_route_is_both_risky_and_ill_conceived/\n This\n follows my objection 17/10/13 that the design, using special ‘Cycle Sa\nfety Fund’ grant, was without merit:\n \nhttp://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/yourtown/abingdon/10734790.Fresh_look_at___300k_cycle_safety_project/\n&#xa0;\nSince then we’ve met officers on site, submitted a comprehensive report and further criticised a slightly modified scheme. \n&#xa0;\nYet \n\"The cabinet member… informed the meeting that the only place in Oxfordshire the council could identify as qualifying for a \nGovernment grant was this area on Wootton Road. \n&#xa0;\nOpenly admitting that the scheme was flawed he continued, overruling safety concerns in order to spend the money before the April deadline.\"\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhen budgets are shrunk and e.g. schools are crying out for zebr\na crossings for their pupils, this is a debacle. \n&#xa0;\nTo willfully misspend £300,000, including misusing c£200,000 of DfT’s Grant in the process, is tantamount to theft. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIs it possible that County Transport Planners and Engineers are so diminished by cuts t\nhat there is inadequate management will and design skill? \n&#xa0;\nLittle response has followed the consultation.  A ‘Cyclox’ member produced a better scheme, earlier on, only to be ignored. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe design is an incompetent response to a problem, which is real enou\ngh. \n&#xa0;\nA County defence that an expensive and poorly located Toucan crossing ‘has to remain, or DfT would withdraw funding’, is spurious.  \n&#xa0;\nIt is irresponsible to spend money just because its there, it belongs to us all. \n&#xa0;\nPerhaps the money should be given \nback to DfT/Treasury, or at least leave requested to produce an effective scheme.  In my understanding of the DfT assessor's comments, a rethink was called for anyway.  It is not too late to do something effective; it’s the will that is lacking.\n&#xa0;\n4.5.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nW\nhilst the\n concern here could be \ndismissed\n as parochial, the case will be repeated through the hundreds of schemes receiv\ning\n \nsuch \nfunding\n, why? :-\n4.5.1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAn officer is charged with developing a response to an accident problem but perhaps with little expectation of funding\n.\n  A\n Government fund appears\n.\n \nIt i\ns grasped even though the design is \nperhaps simplistic\n if worthy\n.  Essentially\n,\n rather than \nmoving\n away from \nthe\n ‘DMRB’ style roundabout\n \non the periphery of an urban area \n- \nwith people travelling by \nbike\n to nursery, school,\n college \netc.\n, a proposal to partly remove cycl\nists from the road has ensu\ned.  \nHowever\n, \ncost engineering has removed the potential benefits and attractiveness of the \ndesign, which\n is now decimated.  An inappropriate single Toucan remains, adding cost and inducing delay.\n  Whilst I am sure th\nis\n problem was, or became \nrecognised\n within the Engineering \nDept.\n of Oxfordshire \nCounty\n Council, there was no will to \njetison\n the design \nand \ntim\ne \nalready \nexpended \nin order\n to reconsider the problem, which \nremains\n soluble.\n4.5.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEven generous central support is \nsquandered\n in this example.  ‘Localism’ has resulted in wastefulness.  \n4.5.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat is needed is some kind of ‘Roads Ombudsman’\n, to act as a design revi\new\ner.  The CABE-\nDesign Council system needs\n to \nbe \nreplicated\n for Highways design.\n&#xa0;\n5.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe argument, even fear, expressed by many campaigners that such segregated provision is too difficult, costly or controversial is falsely based.  \n5.1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf one takes time to understand the development of facilities to be found in continental countries it can be seen that by adopting the concept of a \nsafe, \nphysically segregated (but on-line) provision\n,\n the attainment of the concept may be achieved in a numb\ner of ways, \nusing\n normal processes.  \nMaking\n cycling provisions that enable use by anyone is not rocket science.  Any highways engineer could do it\n,\n \nperhaps \nas demonstrated in Cologne where \nthe City Engineer told a group I led\n: “the politicians \nwanted peopl\ne to be able to use a bike, so this is what we have done …”.  \n5.1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCompared with the \nmassive \nfunding used to effectively enthrall the population to the car, costs can be negligible.  \n5.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEssentially \none\n start\ns\n with \nthe \nidea\n of \ndirect, coherent, continuous provision and \ninitially \nseparated by (mandatory) lines, (\nwith \nparking control\ns\n \noutside\n of these mandatory lines\n).\n  Physical segregation \ncan then\n follow as road\n \nrenewal\n take\ns\n place.\n  \n5.2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
