"&#xa0;\n1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe impact of the scope changes to legal aid for prison law are devastating when placed in the wider\n context of the issues faced by those in justice system.  The prison population remains too high, with a large proportion of people with high needs and/or serving\n indeterminate sentences trapped\n in the system.  The population is set to rise as professional\ns with the experience to managing prisoners are squeezed out of the system\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe complaints system is inadequate as a substitution for legal representation.\n It is lengthy, under-resourced, bureaucratic and only used by adult male prisoners who have years of experience. The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman is not a statutory post and lacks the powers to enforce his decisions.\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is neither desirab\nle nor realis\ntic for prisoners \nto be told to rely on Judicial Review as a safety net in the absence of criminal legal aid for prison law.\n \n&#xa0;\n1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe changes\n to legal aid for prison law and judicial review\n will be a disaster for the safety and rights of children and young pe\nople in prison. \n&#xa0;\n2.1\n              \nFounded in 1866, the Howard League\n for Penal Reform\n is the oldest penal reform\n charity in the \nworld\n. The Howard L\neague has 7,000 members, including prisoners and their families, lawyers, \ncriminal justice professionals and academics. The Howard League has consultative status with both the United Nations and the Council of Europe. It is an independent charity and accepts no grant funding from the UK government.\n&#xa0;\n2.2 \n              \nThe Howard League campaigns for less crime, safer communities and fewer people in prison. We achieve these objectives through conducting and commissioning research and investigations aimed at revealing underlying problems and discovering new solutions\n to issues of public concern. The Howard League’s objectives and principles underlie and inform the charity’s parliamentary work, research, legal and participation work as well as its projects.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.3 \n              \nSince 2002 the Howard League has provided the only leg\nal service dedicated to representing children in custody. We also provide a dedicated legal service for young adults in prison (under 21) and, where appropriate, comment on the particular considerations that are required to ensure that this age group is de\nalt with fairly and appropriately.\n  \n&#xa0;\n2.4\n              \nWe have therefore drawn upon our lawyers’ experience in practice as well as our expertise in this policy area when submitting this written evidence\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.5\n              \nThe Howard League is a member of the Association of Prison \nLawyers and \nJustRights\n. We\n endorse their evidence. Consequently, this submission deals with issues within our particular field of expertise and experience.\n&#xa0;\n3.1.1\n              \nThere are currently\n 84,197 people in prison, 80,323 men and 3,874 women. 10,786 of these prisoners are foreign nationals in detention. \n&#xa0;\n3.1.2 \n              \nAccording to the government’s Updated Impact Assessment for the Offender Rehabilitation Bill,\n \nif passed, around 13,000 offenders wi\nll be recalled or committed to custody, at a\nn additional\n cost of £16\n \nmillion per year.\n  Further, prisons are required to cut up to 16% of their budgets next year.  This will mean losing more experienced staff.\n&#xa0;\n3.1.3 \n              \nIt is estimated that 36 per cent of p\nrisoners have a disability and approximately 25 per cent have a learning disability. In a recent Ministry of Justice study 49 per cent of female prisoners and 23 per cent of male prisoners were assessed as struggling with anxiety and depression. Levels of \nself-harm are high amongst the prison population with 23,134 incidents taking place in the 12 months ending September 2012. Almost 50 per cent of women in prison have attempted suicide at some point in their lives. \n&#xa0;\n3.1.4\n              \nThe prison population is ageing. \nPrisoners over 60 are now the fastest growing group in prison. Many older people in prison have a physical health status \nequivalent to a person\n 10 years\n their senior\n in the community, with a large number suffering from serious and terminal illnesses.\n&#xa0;\n3.1.\n5\n              \nA large proportion of those in prison have experienced social and economic disadvantage. Almost 50 per cent of the prison population \nreport having no qualifications and approximately a quarter \nof prisoners \nneed help with basic literacy. \nA\nround half of al\nl prisoners have histories of debt and 15 per cent report being homeless prior to custody.\n&#xa0;\n3.1.6\n              \nThere are around 12,000 men, and a small number of women, serving \nindeterminate sentences\n. The average sentence length has increased so that \n prisoners\n \non a l\nife sentence \ntypically spend 15 to 20 years behind bars.  The number of lifers has doubled since the introduction of the now defunct indeterminate sentence for public protection in 2003. Each \nindeterminate sentenced \nprisoner costs the taxpayer around \n£600,000 – £800,000 for their term inside.\n&#xa0;3.1\n.7\n              \nThe indeterminate sentence is focused on public safety, reducing the risk the prisoner poses and making sure that the person is safely released at the right time to a sustainable community plan on \nlicence\n. \nAccording to a recent report\n by HMI Probation and HMI Prisons, \n95% to 98% are resettled safely. The inspection report indicated that “assumptions were often made that life sentence prisoners knew all about ‘the system’ which led to an underestimation of t\nhe amount \nof advice and help they needed”.  It also found that “\nsentence planning was weak and probation staff struggled to design meaningful objectives for those who appeared to have done all required work in custody.”\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n.9\n              \nAs the proposed cuts to legal\n aid are brought in\n and wider cuts to criminal justice bite\n, systems will inevitably become more stretched and mistakes will be made. \nPrisons on limited budgets are providing less training for existing staff and newly recruited staff are not required to ha\nve any formal educational qualifications.  This means that prison staff are less able to provide information or advice about the complex legislative framework that governs individual sentences. \nIt is therefor\ne even more important that\n prisoners can get ind\nependent and expert advice to \nprogress through their sentence appropriately towards safe release. Criminal legal aid for prison law currently plays a vital role in getting \nthe journey to release\n right.  It is often vital to ensure that prisoners ge\nt on the\n right courses\n, progress when appropriate to an open prison so they can properly prepare for safe community living and secure appropriate release packages.  All of this work is currently done by lawyers for fixed fees \nf\nor around £220.\n&#xa0;\n3.1.10\n              \nThe inevitabl\ne consequence \nof ending access to independent and skilled legal representatives \nwill be that prisoners will spend longer in closed conditio\nns and longer in open prisons\n at immense public expense\n. \nIf, as a result of the lack of legal advice and challenge, t\nhe 12,000 prisoners on life sentences and IPPs spend an extra year in jail – and only one year is a conservative estimate – this will cost £480 million. This sum dwarfs the £4 million the Ministry of Justice\n hopes to save by\n the ending of legal aid to pris\noners.\n  Public confidence could \nhardly be more affected than by ending a relatively cheap and effective means to secure rehabilitation for prisoners where is not happening as a matter of course.  One shocking consequence of the changes is that prisoners wh\no have made sufficient progress to be awarded a review of their suitability to move to open conditions prior to actual release\n will be deprived of legal aid for representation.  Most will be forced to represent themselves at their parole hearing and will \nhave no choice but to \nquestion \npersonally \nprofessional witnesses as to their assessment of their risk to obtain a fair hearing. \nPrisoners would therefore need to be provided with all the documentation that has hitherto been given to their lawyers, includin\ng details about victims.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1\n              \nThe Justice Secretary has said that prisoners, including children, don’t need lawyers because they can complain. \nMany of the serious issues that Howard League lawyers deal with every day, such as making sure children have a safe place to go to when they leave jail are not suitable for backwards looking complaints systems. A complaints system can only rectify mistakes\n once they have been made, often incurring many months delay. Lawyers representing prisoners with \nsentence planning\n and resettlement help to prevent mistakes.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n              \nEven with help from lawyers, the complaints system has been inadequate to protect \nprisoners \nfrom abuse behind closed doors\n.\n The Howard League has represented children and young adults who have been subjected to unlawful punishments, physical restraints resulting in broken limbs, and moves to mental health facilities. Without legal action these wo\nuld not have been remedied and the abuse would have continued.\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.\n3\n              \nSince July 2010, the legal aid rules have restricted lawyers from claiming for legal aid for issues that could be resolved through the complaints system.  As a consequence, \nthe \nHoward Le\nague\n \nlegal team has considerable experience of conducting complaints on behalf of young people who cannot navigate the system themselves\n.\n \nBecause this work is not covered by legal aid, the charity has had to provide it on a pro bono basis, supported from limited charitable funding. \nOur experience of this work highlights the numerous problems with the complaints system as a form of redress wh\nen compared to the benefits of legal representation:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1\n              \nThe availability of judicial review for prisoners in the future is unclear pending the further consultation on judicial review and the i\nmpact of the residence test on this group: it cannot be said to act as a safety net.  Our lawyers resolve cases simply and efficiently every day.  Although many of these cases could technically turn into judicial review cases, it is in everyone’s interests\n to fix the problem as quickly as possible.\n  \n5.2\n              \nOn the rare occasion that\n judicial review\ns\n become necessary,\n it is vitally important that prisoners are not barred from bringing them due to technical hurdles\n. \nThe response by APL sets out the technical \ndifficulties that will be posed by the new residence test and the way in which judicial review work is structured. We are deeply concerned that the Justice Secretary relies on the availability of legal aid for judicial review as an excuse for withdrawing c\nriminal legal aid for prisoners’ legal problems while at the same time proposing to drastically curtail the availability of legal aid for judicial review.\n5.3\n              \nThe proposed changes to judicial review include not only restrictions on legal aid which will mea\nn that lawyers may simply not be able to burden the financial risk of bringing claims on behalf of individuals but also restricting the right of interest groups to bring claims in the public interest.  Although we appreciate that the new proposals to restr\nict standing are not within the Committee’s ambit, we are concerned that the combination means that organisations like us will no longer be able to assist individuals or raise points of principle.  Our case work over the years has done both, with great ben\nefits to children in prison.  For instance, a case brought on behalf of 14 year old K\n paved the way for all children to have a right to an oral hearing before the parole board whereas the Children Act case\n brought in the Howard League’s own name secured \nchild protection rights for all children in the secure estate.\n6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nChanges to legal aid for prison law and judicial review will be disastrous for the safety and rights of children and young people in prison. 6.1\n              \nThe Howard League legal team has represented hu\nndreds of children in prisons and privately run secure training centres to help them to progress \nmore safely\n through their incarceration and to make sure the arrangements for their resettlement are safe and supportive. Legal aid to pay for this work \nwill b\ne\n essentially abolished.\n  The only criminal legal aid for prison law will relate to parole hearings where release is possible or disciplinary hearings where a magistrate may impose \nadditional days.  \nYet, t\nhese cases affect a small proportion of children.  \nThis is because all other aspects of the criminal justice system are based on the principle that children should be treated differently fro\nm adults. \nHence, most children are detained under Detention and Training Orders.  Although there is no power to \nimpose additional days on children serving such sentences, poor behaviour that might have led to a disciplinary hearing by a judge in the case of an adult, can equally lead to penalties such as the imposition of an electronic tag on release or not getting \nearly release at all.  Yet children will have no access to a lawyer to deal with these issues unless the high threshold for judicial review is met.\n6.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNot only will this mean that children will not get\n onto\n the courses they need to address their offending or \nthe local authority support to reintegrate safely into the community, but it also means that our lawyers won’t find out about any serious abuse going on inside the prison. Access to an expert lawyer, who is on their side, who helps the children to get thei\nr entitlements and help to settle back home is one of the key ways we can all find out about what is going on inside jails.\n6.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe relationship of trust built up between Howard League lawyers and children in custody has shown them that the law can be a force \nfor good, one of the essential components of respect for the law and responsible citizenship.\n&#xa0;\n6.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe announcement that legal aid will no longer be available for prisoners means children in custody will be hidden from view, unable to get redress for abuse. Th\ne history of closed and secretive institutions that hold children is one of abuse and violence. Prisons and STCs are bad enough as intermittent inspections have shown,\n \nbut without legal representation and challenge, they will get worse.\n \nOn the day that the\n secretary of state announced that children in custody will no longer have access to the law, an inspection repor\nt on \nCookham\n Wood prison revealed\n that half of the boys \nheld there \nhad experienced violent restraint, a fifth \nhad been\n \nheld in solitary confinement, \nthe young people\n commonly spend 14 hours a \nday locked in cells and the fact\n that safety was not assured, even after the suicide of a 15 year old last year.\n \n6.5\n              \nThe availability of advocates in prisons is not sufficient reaso\nn to dispense with legal advice and representation.  The advocates provide a vital service, but it is different from a legal service.  The advocates were required because of the immense level of need faced by children in prison. The contracts for such serv\nices (which are not new) require that the advocates resolve things at the lowest level: they are not to \nprovide legal advice\n, nor indeed would they be capabl\ne\n of so doing as they have no legal training or expertise.\n6.6\n              \nThe nuts and bolts of the work the H\noward League’s team undertakes under fixed fees for children concerns serious and important issues – all of which will no longer be available.  This includes:\n&#xa0;\nResettlement \nwork for children in prison: This is work preparing the ground for release on \nlicence\n or under supervision, ensuring that an appropriate accommodation and \na \nsupport package is in place for release. This is vital for a smooth transition back into the local community. Release may be del\nayed because this work will no longer be continued and this will increase the overall costs of detaining a child.  Around 70 per cent of children reoffend.  It is well known that inadequate accommodation and support are linked to reoffending.  Getting the \nright package of support for children on release from custody is critical to the success of the Ministry of Justice’s rehabilitation revolution. \n&#xa0;\nPre-tariff reviews: These are very rare for children and young people.  The system is that those who make goo\nd progress are entitled to be considered for an early review to see if they can progress to open conditions where they will be able to prepare for release and return to education and work.  Most young people will require legal help in securing such a revie\nw. That will no longer be available.  Those who are granted such a review without legal assistance will not have any legal representation at their hearing.   These \nchildren\n \nand young people \nwill be expected to represent themselves, question witnesses and \np\nrepare the case.  It is absurd to think that a young person could have a fair hearing in such circumstances.  Yet there is \nno provision\n for any flexibility to fund such cases.\n&#xa0;\nAccess to offending behaviour courses: \nit is vital for the rehabilitation of\n yo\nung people\n that they attend certain offending \nbehavio\nu\nr\n courses. \nOffending \nbehavio\nu\nr\n work for young people is often complex.  They do not have a large range of standard \nprogrammes\n available to them and they often require assessment to identify the key issu\nes to be addressed, untangling developmental issues from core offending \nbehavio\nu\nr\n needs. \nA lot of our clients are not given the chance to attend the courses \nor get one to one work \nthat should be made available to them. Without \naccess to this work or legal \nhelp to secure it, young people will be at greater risk of reoffending.\n \n&#xa0;\n6.7\n              \nIt is hard to see how the \nJustice Secretary \ncan square these changes which will take away a simple mechanism to prevent or fix error in the rehabilitation system on an ideological footing as he pushes forward his \nRehabilitation Bill as a means to “finally turn the tide and put a stopper in the revol\nving door of the justice system”\n&#xa0;\n7.              Recommendations&#xa0;\n7.1\n              \nWe endorse the recommendations made by APL and \nJustRights\n.  In addition, we recommend that:\n&#xa0;\n 7.1.1\n              \nthe Committee considers these changes in the wider penal context, seeking evidence from the Minis\ntry of Justice as to how the concerns outlined above will be addressed\n \n7.1.2\n              \nthe Committee considers the specific problems that will be faced by young people by the changes to legal aid.\n&#xa0;\n7.2\n              \nWe would be willing to provide oral evidence if required.\n&#xa0;\n27 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n \n              \nThese are the anticipated consequences of the Rehabilitation \nof Offenders’ Bill currently before Parliament.\n A\ns of\n \n20\n \nSeptember 2013\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/upload\ns/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/208171/updated-rehabilitation-bill-impact-assessment.pdf\n \nAvailable at \nhttp://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/publications/inspectorate-reports/hmiprobation/joint-thematic/life-sentence-prisoners.pdf\n \n Such hearings are called pre-tariff reviews.\n \n \nLord \nCarlile’s\n report is available at \nhttp://d19ylpo4aovc7m.cloudfront.net/fileadmin/howard_league/user/pdf/Publications/Carlile_Report_pdf.pdf\n  \nThe Howard League’s report\n on the use of restraint on children in custody is available at:\nhttp://d19ylpo4aovc7m.cloudfront.net/fileadmin/howard_league/user/pdf/Publication\ns/Restraint.pdf\n \n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.howardleague.org/legal-fight/\n \n&#xa0;\n \nR (on the application of K) v Parole Board [2006] EWHC 2413 (Admin)\n \nR (on the application of The \nHoward League for Penal Reform\n) \nv Secretary of State and the Department of Health [2002] EWHC 2497 (Admin)\n \nhttp://www.cjp.org.uk/news/archive/chief-inspector-warns-of-seriously-unsafe-conditions-at-cookham-wood-05-08-2009/\n \n \nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/justice-secretary-chris-grayling-to-set-out-wideranging-shakeup-of-the-criminal-justice-system-8608365.html\n \n"
