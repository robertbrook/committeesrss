"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Richard Lee [FBB0001]&#xa0;\nThe funding model for the BBC should be reviewed to make it fairer and allow the BBC to focus.\nW\nith the huge selection of channels available\n these days I feel that I cannot see any justification in forcing UK households to pay for any programme types \nexcept those seen as a strictly public service focus and to give independent TV a chance to grow in the UK.\nPublic Service in my view would be very focused \nI.E: OU, Children’s Programmes, News reporting rather than extended current affairs. \nThese programm\nes would be better in my view funded by general taxation \nwith \nall other television funded by optional subscription which was not on option prior to digital television.\nMy motivation for writing in.\nI live in Switzerland with my wife, we pay the Swiss TV li\ncence and also subscribe to a Pay TV package which includes UK TV channels.\nAs our parents are in their late 70’s we keep a small flat near them in order to be able one of us to fly over and look after them at short notice if required. Typically we current\nly only live in it a few days a year. \nAs we have a TV in the house I have to buy a UK TV Licence even to watch a few days TV which seems absurdly unfair when I am already paying for it over here. \nA further point is that via the internet or cable I can ac\ncess hundreds of TV channels wherever I am in the world via my Swiss provider &amp; the internet legally- unless I do so in the UK?\nI feel that the BBC has grown into a monster we don’t need to afford any more and we would probably be more creative as a nation\n without it.\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
