defaultWritten evidence from the UK Major Ports Group (WRT 009)defaultSummarydefault1
default              
defaultThe arrangements for winter resilience for transport have improved greatly since the winter of 2009/10. The strategic importance of ports to the UK economy is now much better recognised in planning arrangements. Moreover much of the strategic stockpile of 
defaultsalt and grit is being stored at ports which can provide the necessary space, access to supply lines, and handling and distribution expertise. It is essential that ports and main connecting road and rail links continue to be given priority in winter resili
defaultence planning. 
defaultIntroductiondefault2
default              
defaultUKMPG is one of two associations representing ports in the UK.  Our 9 member groups handle over 70 percent of the UK’s international trade by volume, and therefore play a significant role in supporting the UK economy and prom
defaultoting exports.  UK ports are privately financed and do not seek any financial help from the taxpayer.

defaultDuring

defaultevere winter weather in January 2010
default,
default 
defaultsome ports began to encounter problems because they were not getting the salt they neede
defaultd to keep
default 
defaultfull operations going. These delivery problems ap
defaultpeared to be linked to the 
defaultGovernment’s 
defaultthen 
defaultprioritisation programme with the Highways Agency and local authorities being given priority for supply over all other customers. On behalf its members 
defaultUKMPG pressed strongly for ports to be given high priority for salt supplies not only as an essential part of the nation’s transport infrastructure  network but also because of their role in the distribution of imported salt and grit. The Department of Tra
defaultnsport acted on these concerns and facilitated the distribution of salt and grit supplies to ports which needed them.
defaultQuarmbydefault Reportdefault4
default              
defaultIn February 2010 the then Secretary of State for Transport announced that severe winter planning would need to be handled
default more strategically in future and that the Government would be commissioning a review. In the event this review was carried out by a small team led by David 
defaultQuarmby
default CBE. 
default 
defaultUKMPG inputted to this review and 
defaultwe 
defaultwere pleased to see that the final report publis
defaulthed in October 2010 stressed the strategic importance of ports and the strong economic case for maintaining access to ports during 
defaultsevere winter conditions. The main recommendations affecting ports were that 
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultports should increase their own pre season salt
default stock holdings to 
defaultminimise

defaultPorts moved quickly to respond to the report where necessary strengthening the links with highway authorities and also participating in the development of the national

defaultsalt stockpile managed by the H

default              
defaultIn Autumn 2011 Department for Transport officials wrote to ports in England inviting them to participate in strengthening contingency planning for the forthcoming winter. 
defaultDfT
default commended ports for improved performance
default during the severe weather in the previous winter which had much to do with greater strategic stockpiles of salt and improved planning. In the light of this experience and the implementation of the 
defaultQuarmby
default review 
defaultDfT
default drew up an overall action plan for port
defaults for winter 2011/2. The main new elements of this were
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA standardized ports industry template on severe weather planning designed to ensure consistency of approach and strengthened co-ordination between the ports sector and the Government. This was drafte

defaultSome of the actions that ports themselves have taken to improve winter resilien
defaultce on port sites include
default              
default-    Building new storage facilities for salt and grit
default              
default-    Acquiring additional snow ploughs and gritting machines
default              
default-    Trialing de-
defaulticer
default sprays on cranes
default              
default-    Arrangements put in place to lease additional snow clearance 
defaultvehicles at short notice
default              
default-   Working closely with the Met Office via Local Resilience Forums to receive bespoke severe weather forecasts and alerts
default              
default-  Developing Business Resilience and Continuity 
defaultprogrammes
default to cover all issues connected with extreme wea
defaultther including snow and flooding, and carrying out regular test exercises.
defaultCurrent positiondefault&#xa0;default8
default              
defaultMajor ports are satisfied that prioritization and planning arrangements are now much improved since the problems encountered in winter 2009/10. Should there be a
default recurrence of severe wintery conditions in winter 2013/4, ports will work closely with customers, stakeholders and other infrastructure providers to ensure that any disruption is kept to a minimum. It is essential that connecting infrastructure to and fro
defaultm ports receives priority for snow and ice clearance etc – ports are liaising closely with h
defaultighway authorities and Network R
defaultail on this. It also remains important that ports have guaranteed salt and grit availability in the event of severe weather.
