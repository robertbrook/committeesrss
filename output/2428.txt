&#xa0;Written evidence from Jim Kent (TIC 109)&#xa0;1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; I represent Somerset Forums on the SW Forum on Ageing which feeds directly into the UK Advisory Forum on Ageing. I chair the Dunster Patient Participation Group.A two-hourly service does not encourage use of public transport for work or leisure, and if buses are not available to meet the demand, then local people will choose to drive themselves or rely on taxis or friends with cars to take them where they want to go.4.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Mr Bond, an ex service 28 driver from Watchet is reported in Somerset County Gazette (July 26): “When Somerset County Council started cutting bus subsidies First altered the evening services to a pattern that was of no use to anyone.  It then offered a ‘use it or lose it’ option and the result was even fewer passengers.” “This is a clear-cut case of profit over public service. First is supposed to be running a public service.  I used to get the 10.30pm bus back from Dunster when I went for a few beers with my son-in-law.  When that got scrapped I got the 9.30pm one. Now I’ll not even be able to do that.  At the very least they should have a late service from Minehead through Washford, Williton and Watchet.” An example of what should be avoided is poor labelling of service routes compounded by poor communication. The recent First bus revisions included the statement “The current Service 22 between Taunton and Tonedale will be re-numbered as Service 22A, while the current Service 22A between Taunton and Rockwell Green will be re-numbered as Service 22. The timetable has also been completely redesigned…”In Bridgwater, a revised pick-up point led an elderly lady with dementia to believe she had missed the bus where she had caught it for the past 20 years, and caused great distress to herself and her family.A local lady was advised that she should travel to Taunton hospital for treatment on a daily basis for a week.  Her appointment times were constrained quite tightly (presumably there was some urgency and other slots were filled) but she was just not eligible for hospital supported transport.  The alternative for a shorter and more comfortable journey would have been a taxi, but the return farefor each 40 mile round trip would have been £26.  She found the prospect of £130 outlay for 5 day NHS treatment beyond her means and so did not pursue that route.  I have no idea of the final outcome.Second example comes from a conversation with the barman at what used to be the Royal British Legion club in Taunton. He travels from Wellington to Taunton each day he is working using a bus at £6 for the return journey. As the last bus now leaves Taunton at 20.00, he must use a taxi to get home from an evening event – at a cost of £20.   For somebody on relatively low wages this is exorbitant.We used to have vouchers for taxis from the County Council for appropriate individuals, but these were cut some years ago. I believe some local versions still exist, but the cost to the passenger is much the same as a bus would be, sometimes more. Local, privately organised trasport services have come and though some still exist, many have gone.  External constraints regarding safety, equiment, maintenance, fuel costs and so on are becoming excessive and in the absence of central funding,  local sources of funding are unreliable and generally decreasing – people just do not have the spare cash.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
