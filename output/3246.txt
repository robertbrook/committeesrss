[[[Questions 1 and 2]]]

[[[Question 3]]]“the Duchy object to the Bill and submit that it should not be allowed to pass into law ... constitutionally a Private Bill cannot confer powers to acquire compulsorily property belonging to His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales in right of His Duchy of Cornwall, and in implementation of this constitutional principle clause 49 has been included in the Bill.  However, the Duchy wishes to present its views to Parliament and accordingly waives its rights under that clause.  If, after hearing those views and those of the other Petitioners, Parliament decides that it is in the public interest to authorise the construction of the Swincombe reservoir and associated works, the Duchy would accept that decision and negotiate with the water undertakers for the sale or lease to them of such land and interests in the land as may be required for the reservoir and other works.”
