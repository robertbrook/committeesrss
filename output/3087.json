"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Clean Highways (SRN 041)&#xa0;BackgroundIn March 2010 Mike Penning \nMP\n said in\n a \ndebate in Westminster Hall on Motorway Litter\n \nthat \n“\nour road networks,\n in particular our motorways\n \na\nre\n \nblighted by rubbish\n.\n I am \naware that there \nis \nlegislation in place however …\n it is frankly not working\n“. \nRather disappointingly none of the \nHighways Agency’s Business Plans\n published during his s\nubsequent tenure \nas minister with responsibility for \nthe \nmotorways\n \ncontained any reference\n to this problem.\nThe prime objective of \nClean Highways\n is to\n find out why the legislation is not working and advise the Government accordingly. I am now working \nclosely \nwith Andrew Gwynne MP\n.\n \n&#xa0;Statutory DutyThe Secretary of State for Transport has a duty under the S89 (1) of the \nEnvironmental Protection Act 1990\n (EPA) in respect to the trunk roads and motorways for which he is responsible \nto ensure, so far as is practicable, that they are kept clear of litter and refuse. \nIn doing so h\ne has to hav\ne regard to the \nLitter Code of Practice\n.\n&#xa0;RelevanceAny \nfailings in this regard \nshould\n be taken into account in \nconsidering \nthe \nreforms required to improve the \nmanagement of the network. Also, \nefficient travel\n should include the concept of travel in a clean environment. \n&#xa0;Summary &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Service provider contract mismanagement&#xa0;\nThe contractor\n c\nould then devis\ne his own programme of inspections\n and \ncleansing\n,\n \nand\n be \nmotivated to\n \nexecute it in a timely \nand thorough \nmanner\n.\nHowever t\nhis is not what happens\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe Agency does not carry out any formal monitoring\n of the cleanliness of \nthis motorway\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPlease refer to\n \nmy\n \ne-mail to t\nh\ne Permanent Secretary\n and the \nunhelpful reply\n I received.\n&#xa0;\nFurther reading\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
