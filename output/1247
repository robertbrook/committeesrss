defaultWritten evidence submitted by defaultDr defaultCarrie Dunndefault [WAS0001]default&#xa0;defaultProfiledefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultAbout this defaultpaperdefault&#xa0;defaultThis briefing paper argues that women and girls need to feel that sport is open to them as spectators and participants – both equally important - rather than seeing it as a male-dominated field, which is still the case. I highlight some of the key a
defaultspects of female sports fandom, and suggest that despite the growing numbers of women involved in sport, it is still institutionally sexist, creating problems for those who object to covert and overt sexism.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe paper 
defaultfocuses on my completed research proj
defaultect into 
defaultthe experience of female fans of men's professional football in England, and based on a questionnaire completed by 100 respondents of varying demographic followed by 27 in-depth interviews. I also interviewed club directors and representatives of 
defaultthe FA and Football League to add context to my findings.
default&#xa0;
defaultI am currently working on a research project looking at the significance of elite sporting role models to young participants, focusing on football and cricket.

defaultThe role of the familydefault&#xa0;
defaultF
defaultemale fans tend to be introduced to football by family members, who encourage their spectatorship, often as part of a familial tradition. This mostly occurs in childhood. I suggest that if girls are put off football or they are told that it is “for boys”, 
defaultthey accept and do not question this, and remain outside football for the rest of their lives. Occasionally women begin watching football in adulthood, but my findings indicate that this is not particularly common, giving the lie to the stereotype that adu
defaultlt women go to football only to keep their husband or boyfriend company.
default&#xa0;
defaultRespondents indicated that strong personal influences played a large role in initiating them into football support, with a particular individual (a family member, a friend or colleag
defaultue) being identified as a significant initiator in 91% of questionnaire respondents; only 9% of respondents claimed they first went to football alone and of their own volition.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe father was named as the key influence by half of respondents, and I sugges
defaultt that this reflects a more involved (and possibly more egalitarian) style of parenting in the late 20
defaultth
default and early 21
defaultst
default century, where fathers can spend leisure time with their daughters, not just their sons, through a shared regular football support.

defaultFemale fans experience lifelong attachments to their clubs which are rather more complex than previous studies have indicated; the stereotypes that all 
defaultwomen go to football just as adjuncts to male partners or to display 'femaleness' by gazing at male sportsmen are not necessarily empirically true (although none of my respondents practised their fandom in such a way, it is possible that such fans may exis
defaultt).

defaultMedia consumptiondefault&#xa0;
defaultMany respondents watched football programmes on television. 90 per cent watched television highlights of matches they had attended; 86 per cent watched television highlights of matches they had not attended; and 83 per cent 
defaultregularly watched live matches on television. When it came to consumption of football news, 81 per cent of respondents used their club’s official website, 53 per cent used the BBC Sport website, 50 per cent used their club’s unofficial website, and 50 per 
defaultcent regularly read a daily tabloid newspaper’s sports section.
default&#xa0;
defaultOne programme discussed by many respondents was Sky Sports' Soccer AM; the “
defaultladdish
default” tone of the show creates an ideological dilemma for female viewers, who acknowledge that it can be seen as
default sexist with regular features such as the 
defaultSoccerette
default, but many dealt with this by treating it as “silly” or “a joke” or “their choice” rather than something offensive (much like the way in which some women deal with their feelings about Page 3 girls or lap
default dancing clubs).

defaultPregnancy and motherhooddefault&#xa0;
defaultThe stereotype is that once a woman becomes a mother, her domestic commitments prevent her from continuing with her normal leisure arrangements in a way that simply does not apply to men when they become fathers.
default There seems to be no clear pattern, though; some women stop going to matches entirely – perhaps because they have less money since going on maternity leave, or because they lack reliable childcare; and some continue to attend, simply with a baby strapped 
defaulton to them instead. The lack of baby-changing facilities at grounds was mentioned by many parents, and some suggested that clubs should consider providing facilities for mothers and babies, as a generation of women who have always felt entitled to go to fo
defaultotball begin to start their families but continue to go to grounds.

defaultIssues of safetydefault&#xa0;
defaultThough some of them admitted that other women (such as their own mothers!) thought football supporting was an unsuitable activity for a woman, none of them mentioned that they felt out of place or in physical danger at a football ground.

defaultPractices of fadefaultndomdefault&#xa0;
defaultEarly evidence indicates that female football fans are more likely than their male equivalents to become involved in the cooperative supporters' trust movement. The inclusive community ethos driving the trust movement offers a new way of supporting f
defaultor those concerned with their club’s position in the locality and the outreach work that can be done through football with marginalised groups.  This concern to extend football to all interested parties – not just the traditional male, working/lower-middle
default-class demographic - may explain the attraction of the trust movement for female fans.

defaultInstitutional sexismdefault&#xa0;
defaultThis leads on to a theme running throughout my research: football as a sport is still institutionally sexist and aimed at men (the media simply 
defaultreflects that). Occasionally the 
defaultinstitutionalised sexism of football is made explicit, which was the case with a widely-reported incident in 2006, when then-Luton Town manager Mike Newell complained about assistant referee Amy Rayner, saying:
default&#xa0;
defaultShe shouldn
default’t be here. I know that sounds sexist but I am sexist. This is not park football, so what are women doing here
default?...
defaultIt is tokenism - for the politically-correct idiots. We have a problem in this country with political correctness and bringing women into the 
defaultgame is not the way to improve refereeing and officialdom. It is absolutely beyond belief. When do we reach a stage when all officials are women because then we are in trouble? It is bad enough with the incapable referees and linesmen we have but if you st
defaultart bringing in women, you have big problems. (BBC News, 2006)
default&#xa0;
defaultRespondents had a sense of resignation about Newell's comments; it was almost as if they expected high-profile figures to say such things. There was little anger or outright desire to change p
defaulteople's mindsets; there seemed to be an acceptance that football was always going to have such sexist attitudes within it and there would be no point complaining.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis persistence of institutionalised sexism is unsurprising bearing in mind the lack of und
defaulterstanding of female fans' experiences and practices shown by clubs and authorities. Club directors and governing body officials demonstrated in their interviews with me their fear of the 'new' and of isolating or disenfranchising the 'traditional' (
defaultie
default mal
defaulte and working-class) fan, particularly with regard to taking action against sexism in the ground and in the game more broadly, where they were keen to distance themselves from accusations of “feminism” or “political correctness”. This is despite the fact t
defaulthat both clubs and authorities are anxious to encourage families to attend, including mothers and daughters. However, it is clear that this anxiety is not due to a keenness to promote equality of opportunity, simply a desire to maximise ticket revenues and
default merchandise spend.
default&#xa0;
defaultSexism is an unspoken, covert dynamic operating within football; it is institutionally ingrained in the sport; and it is never explicitly criticised as the authorities refuse to take the lead in combating this form of prejudice, and as
default such sexist attitudes persist. The easiest way to deal with this for respondents is to ignore it, just as most did with Mike Newell’s comments. As such, sexism remains implicit as football is not portrayed or perceived as a deliberately welcoming sphere f
defaultor women: football clubs may say they want more women to attend games and that women are welcome to become football fans, but displays of women as cheerleaders at grounds or as '
defaultSoccerettes
default' on mainstream football television indicate otherwise.
default&#xa0;
defaultConclusidefaultondefault&#xa0;
defaultIt is certainly a possibility that the numbers of female fans in male professional football will increase over the next ten years as girls who have always played the game mature into financially independent womanhood. When I interviewed representatives
default from football clubs and the football authorities (the FA and the Football League), they seemed to think this might be the case.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, this was mere speculation. They had very little data on female consumers of football, regardless of age, and regardle
defaultss of how they consume football, whether it is as a player or as a fan, because there has been very little research done in this field.  I have found no hard evidence to suggest that girls now who play football will be women who support men’s football in t
defaulthe future; indeed, with the current high profile of the FA WSL, perhaps they will decide to support women's football instead.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat does seem clear from my research is that if women are encouraged to participate in 
defaultfootball, whether that is through 
defaultadvertising, marketing or encouragement from individuals close to them, they will certainly do so – whether that is as a spectator or as a player.
