defaultUnite – Written evidencedefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default1.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultUnite is the largest trade union for Britain and Ireland with 1.5 million members. 
default&#xa0;
default We represent workers in all areas of industry including food retail and distribution, hotel and casino workers, agriculture, road, rail, air and sea transport, manufacturing, local authorities, the health service, civil service, community not for profit sector, construction and building materials, print and media, finance and legal and utilities.    
default&#xa0;
default1.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultUnite campaigns  on health and safety issues in a number of ways at European level, such as by participating in social dialogue on silica and construction and taking part in EU supported seminars and other activities, most recently in relation to EU regulatory plans for offshore drilling and in civil aviation. 
default&#xa0;
default1.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultUnite’s
default response to this call for evidence focuses on three areas of concern and related clauses which we oppose. These are:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default1.4.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe are aware that that these are also key concerns for the TUC and we are supportive of its response to the Joint Committee.
default&#xa0;
default1.5.
default&#xa0; 
defaultBefore turning to the three key points above, we must make the more general point that attempting to include such a wide range of issues in one piece of legislation is poorly thought out and confusing. In 
defaultUnite’s
default view,   pursuing the Bill in this way, and at speed, will undoubtedly lead to bad legislation and will result in detriment and increased cost to workers, their families and communities and to society as a whole.
default&#xa0;
default1.6.
default&#xa0; 
defaultUnite is also aware that the UK Marine Pilots Association, which is part of Unite, has sent in a separate submission which relates specifically to Clause 25 of the Draft Deregulation Bill (concerning removal of duty to order re-hearing of marine accident investigations), and shares the concerns raised. 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default2.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn summary, Unite is opposed to Clause 1 because:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default2.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultUnite does not accept the government’s deregulation agenda. In our view it will weaken 
defaultlegislation which is in place for the specific and necessary purpose of protecting workers’ rights and their health and safety. 
defaultWe are strongly opposed to and strongly condemn the removal of any health and safety protection. No self-employed worker – no matter how “low risk” their work is perceived to be – should be exempted from health and safety law.  
default&#xa0;
default2.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe proposal in Clause 1 is a recipe for disaster.
default&#xa0;
default2.4.
default&#xa0; 
defaultNo evidence has been produced in support of the changes proposed in Clause 1, other than the recommendation by Professor 
defaultRagnar
default 
defaultLöfstedt
default in his 2011 review of health and safety regulations that some self-employed workers should be exempt. Professor 
defaultLöfstedt
default based his recommendation of 
default“exempting from health and safety law those self-employed whose work activities pose no potential risk of harm to others” 
defaulton the fact that a number of respondents to his review had argued for such an exemption. He did not explore the potential impact of such a move on health and standards and provided no evidence for its need.
default&#xa0;
default2.5.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAccordingly, Unite strongly doubts the rationale for and validity of the proposals contained in the draft Bill. We believe that an exemption will result in uncertainty and misunderstanding about exactly which regulations apply and to whom, with the inevitable impact of an increase in work-related accidents, injuries and deaths.
default&#xa0;
default2.6.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThis can only serve to result in additional burdens on society as more injured people who are unable to work and are already limited by the government’s civil justice reforms in their ability to claim compensation, turn to the State to support them and their families
default..
default&#xa0;
default2.7.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAs well as there being no safety reason for the proposal, there is no economic justification that we are aware of. The ministers who are promoting the Bill say it will save business £300,000. It seems to Unite that this paltry amount demonstrates that it is an entirely ideological move, one based on the consistently misplaced, dangerous and wilfully ignorant approach to employee health and safety - and by implication public safety – taken by the Coalition Government.
default&#xa0;
default2.8.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe move will increase confusion for the self-employed and duty-holders about whether they are covered or not. This is extremely hazardous for both workers and society generally. As said, adopting this proposal will lead to an increase in injuries, deaths and occupational illness.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultHealth and Safety at Work Act
default&#xa0;
default2.9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 (HSWA) provides essential protection for members of the public from the effect of the work activities of others, not just employees.   For example, in the passenger transport sector, both passengers and employees are covered by the HSWA. Taxi drivers are generally self-employed workers.
default&#xa0;
default2.10.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe current provisions of the HSWA also provide essential protection for other workers who may work with the self-employed.  Though the working relationship and contractual position of the self-employed can be different from employees, their work 
defaultactivities may pose a risk to employees they are working alongside, or to the public. This sensible approach to health and safety protection must be maintained.
default&#xa0;
default2.11.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUnite is also concerned that if this exemption is made then other wider issues will be overlooked. For example, many self-employed people work in situations where they have no control over their working environment and so require the same protection as workers. This can include self-employed workers in major sectors such as finance or IT where self-employed contractors sit alongside other workers doing the same job.
default&#xa0;
default2.12.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn addition, many employees have been designated as self-employed who are not self-employed at all, with some employers trying to get around employment law or to avoid paying tax or National Insurance – widespread bogus self employment in the construction industry being an example. Many self-employed people are employers in their own right.
default&#xa0;
default2.13.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe proposal for exemption relates to self-employed people who do not employ people and whose work activities pose no potential risk or harm to others. This in itself demonstrates that no change is needed. If a work activity poses no risk to anyone else then there are no circumstances whereby a self-employed person could be prosecuted under the HSWA, unless they harmed themselves. We fail to see where the “burden on business” lies.     
default&#xa0;
default2.14.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIf another person is injured then it becomes a matter of fact that this activity had the potential to cause harm to others. This means that the only intended effect of this change would be to stop people being prosecuted for harming themselves.  
default&#xa0;
default2.15.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSome self-employed activities can be very harmful (such as farming and some craft work), and it is essential that these workers continue to get support and advice from the HSE on how to protect themselves.
default&#xa0;
default2.16.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIf they do injure themselves then this is really a matter for the HSE or Local Authority prosecution policy rather than a change in regulations. Unite believes that it is unlikely to be in the public interest to prosecute a sole self-employed worker who poses no risk to others who injures themselves – and indeed, we are not aware of any such a prosecution.
default&#xa0;
default2.17.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUnite is also very alarmed by the very dangerous messages which will be sent by changing the law. Although those who “direct” self-employed people will still have legal duties, Unite predicts that rogue contractors and others will attempt to avoid responsibility by making more people self employed because they believe that they will be exempt from health and safety legislation.  In other words an increase in bogus self employment will result which will also have economic consequences.
default&#xa0;
default2.18.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs well as creating confusion about which self-employed people are exempt of not, any exemption will send the wrong message to the self-employed: that they have no responsibility to take any precautions to protect their own safety or health. As a result any change is likely to have a significant effect on the injury levels of both self-employed (real and bogus) as well as those who work with them or the public. 
default&#xa0;
default2.19.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAccording to the government’s own statistics, a third of immediate workplace deaths are among the self-employed people are more than twice as likely to be killed as 
defaultemployees. There is a fatality rate of 1.2 per 100,000 for the self-employed as against 0.5 per 100,000 for employees. 
default&#xa0;
default2.20.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe believe that the proposal is unworkable in legal terms. Unite is also very concerned that the HSE and local authorities will not be able to give guidance and support to the self employed who are to be exempt if they are removed from the Health and Safety at Work Act.
default&#xa0;
defaultHSE Impact assessment
default&#xa0;
default2.21.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs said, Unite questions the basis of the proposal. The impact assessment produced to support the HSE consultation in 2012 clearly confirmed that there is absolutely no evidence for exempting the self-employed from health and safety legislation.
default&#xa0;
default2.22.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUnite submitted a response to an HSE consultation in 2012 which set out various options to be pursued further to the 
defaultLöfstedt
default Review. Unite did not support the option favoured by the HSE in the consultation paper, and believes that no change to legislation is necessary.  As said, the impact assessment of the HSE consultation in 2012 provided no evidence base for exempting self-employed people from health and safety legislation.
default&#xa0;
default2.23.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFor the strong reasons outlined above Unite urges that the law should not be changed and that it is in the public interest to maintain the current duties on the self-employed.  There are no unnecessary legal, economic or administrative burdens caused by the duties and current legal requirements are clear and simple. If the law changes, then every self-employed person will have to make assessments about their activities. Many will lack the necessary skills or competence to do this.
default&#xa0;
default2.24.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUnite believes that many employers will misunderstand the changes and some will do so deliberately. The inevitable result will be that deaths, injuries and illnesses among the self-employed, and those caused by the self-employed, will rise. This is completely unacceptable at any level.
default&#xa0;
default2.25.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSelf-employed people who do not employ other people are already exempted from the requirement to complete a written risk assessment. Unite would not wish any self-employed person to be prosecuted because of an injury they have done to themselves where no other person was at risk. 
default&#xa0;
default2.26.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIf the government has evidence that the position is not fully understood then a simple clarification of the HSE and Local Authority prosecution policy would suffice. It does not require a change in the law.
default&#xa0;
default2.27.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe main purpose of the enforcement of health and safety legislation is to punish those who do not comply with health and safety requirements and thereby encourage compliance. Enforcement is proven to encourage compliance with health and safety legislation and this has been supported both by HSE research and other research for example in the USA. If all employers complied with health and safety legislation then the massive annual cost to the economy of accidents and ill-health would vanish. This can be achieved by ensuring that health and safety regulators and enforcers are adequately funded to exercise their regulatory powers effectively, not to water down the regulations.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultUnite is opposed to clause 2 of the draft Bill which would remove the power of Employment Tribunals to issue wider recommendations to employers found to have unlawfully discriminated. The government argues that it wants to remove this provision because of employer fears about inappropriate or excessive recommendations, yet provides no proper evidence to substantiate this.
default&#xa0;
default3.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAs the TUC points out in its submission to the Committee, according to a recent study in the Equality Opportunities Review, in 2012 there were just 19 cases where Tribunals issued wider recommendations. In 15 of those cases the recommendation was for training on equality and diversity and in seven cases respondents were asked to address equality issues generally or to review policies.
default&#xa0;
default3.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultEmployment Tribunal recommendations are made by a Tribunal judge and two lay members, including one representing business, following a full hearing considering all evidence. This enables recommendations and suggestions to address serious cases of discrimination to be considered and appropriate. Indeed, such recommendations are well regarded and often promoted as good practice by business, government and other organisations. In the absence of such recommendations, many bad employers will fail to deal with the causes of discrimination.
default&#xa0;
default3.4.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe TUC’s submission also points out three major flaws in the government’s Impact Assessment (IA) of August 2012. Firstly, the IA fails to adequately capture the broader benefits to the workplace and employment practices of employers implementing recommendations. Secondly, the equality impact of repealing this provision has not been properly considered. Thirdly, the IA is out of date. There are now significantly more cases (at least 28 according to Equality Opportunities Review) which should be included in any credible and improved impact assessment.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default4.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThese clauses impose a new duty on bodies that perform particular regulatory functions to have regard in the exercise of those functions to the desirability of promoting economic growth.
default&#xa0;
default4.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultUnite is concerned that this is not only potentially damaging in a number of ways, but that it may also compromise the independence of certain regulatory bodies such as the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), which are required under EU legislation to operate at arm’s length from government in respect of some of their statutory functions.
default&#xa0;
default4.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe wording in these clauses – what is meant by economic growth, for example - is far from clear and likely to lead to confusion. 
default&#xa0;
default4.4.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWhilst it is important to support economic growth, it is also important not to impede regulators’ ability to perform their statutory duties. Providing a statutory duty obliging regulators to have regard to economic growth, with considerable uncertainty about how this might work, presents such a risk.
default&#xa0;default4.5.
default&#xa0; 
defaultNeither is there any clarity concerning the enforcement of fulfilling the new duty or assessing whether it conflicts with an existing duty. There is also a risk that parties subject to regulation will attempt to use the new duty as a ‘get out clause’. For example, an employer may argue that following a particular procedure that makes for a healthier and safer working environment impedes their ability to make a profit and contribute to economic growth.
default&#xa0;
default4.6.
default&#xa0; 
defaultUnite opposes these clauses. No evidence is given to support their introduction, they are poorly worded and risk damaging the safety and welfare of workers and citizens.
