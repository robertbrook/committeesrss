defaultWritten evidence from the Police and Crime Commissioner for Lincolnshire [CST0064]default&#xa0;defaultCrime Statisticdefaultsdefault&#xa0;defaultThank you for your letter of 6
defaultth
default December 2013.
default&#xa0;
defaultPlease find below my response to the two questions posed.
default&#xa0;
default1. What, ifdefault any, targets do you set for your police force? What impact do you think thisdefault defaulthas on police recording crime practices?default&#xa0;defaultI do not set targets for my force. Targets are, in my opinion, counter-productive
default 
defaultbecause they
default 
defaultbecome an end in themselves.
default&#xa0;
defaultInstead I set out very clearly in my Police and Crime Plan the views of the people of
default 
defaultLincolnshire on how they believe their county should be policed. This takes into
default 
defaultaccount the
default 
defaultconcerns, suggestions and aspirations of the communities that the force and I serve.
default&#xa0;
defaultSince there are no targets, there should be no impact on the way crimes are
default 
defaultrecorded. I
default 
defaultbelieve there is no impact My force is involved in preventing and detecting crime, not target
default-
defaultchasing.
default&#xa0;
default2. How do you assure yourself that the recorded crime figures for your area are correct?default defaultTo what extent can you trust the crime statistics for your area?default&#xa0;defaultI have never had any reason to doubt the way in w
defaulthich crime figures are recorded.
default&#xa0;
defaultI have examined the methodology of crime recording and I have monthly meetings with the
default 
defaultChief Officer team. I meet the Chief Constable far more frequently on a one-to-one basis.
default 
defaultAmong other things, this enables me to have a firm grasp on those areas of performance
default 
defaultwhere the most recent data or an emerging trend indicates that action needs to be taken. As
default 
defaultan example, this approach led a rising trend in shoplifting to be visible to me, enabled me to
default 
defaultdiscuss with senior officers their plans for addressing it and monitor and challenge the
default 
defaultimpact their actions were having.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe point is that I am able to scrutinise the latest data at any time, not simply at
default 
defaultmeetings
default 
defaultconcerned with performance. I take full advantage of this - I think to the benefit of the people
default 
defaultI represent, which of course includes my force's officers and staff; they, too, along with
default 
defaultvolunteers are my constituents.
