[normal]Written evidence from the Police and Crime Commissioner for Lincolnshire [CST0064][bold]&#xa0;[bold]Crime Statistic[bold]s[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Thank you for your letter of 6
[normal]th
[normal] December 2013.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Please find below my response to the two questions posed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1. What, if[bold] any, targets do you set for your police force? What impact do you think this[bold] [bold]has on police recording crime practices?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]I do not set targets for my force. Targets are, in my opinion, counter-productive
[normal] 
[normal]because they
[normal] 
[normal]become an end in themselves.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Instead I set out very clearly in my Police and Crime Plan the views of the people of
[normal] 
[normal]Lincolnshire on how they believe their county should be policed. This takes into
[normal] 
[normal]account the
[normal] 
[normal]concerns, suggestions and aspirations of the communities that the force and I serve.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Since there are no targets, there should be no impact on the way crimes are
[normal] 
[normal]recorded. I
[normal] 
[normal]believe there is no impact My force is involved in preventing and detecting crime, not target
[normal]-
[normal]chasing.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. How do you assure yourself that the recorded crime figures for your area are correct?[bold] [bold]To what extent can you trust the crime statistics for your area?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]I have never had any reason to doubt the way in w
[normal]hich crime figures are recorded.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I have examined the methodology of crime recording and I have monthly meetings with the
[normal] 
[normal]Chief Officer team. I meet the Chief Constable far more frequently on a one-to-one basis.
[normal] 
[normal]Among other things, this enables me to have a firm grasp on those areas of performance
[normal] 
[normal]where the most recent data or an emerging trend indicates that action needs to be taken. As
[normal] 
[normal]an example, this approach led a rising trend in shoplifting to be visible to me, enabled me to
[normal] 
[normal]discuss with senior officers their plans for addressing it and monitor and challenge the
[normal] 
[normal]impact their actions were having.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The point is that I am able to scrutinise the latest data at any time, not simply at
[normal] 
[normal]meetings
[normal] 
[normal]concerned with performance. I take full advantage of this - I think to the benefit of the people
[normal] 
[normal]I represent, which of course includes my force's officers and staff; they, too, along with
[normal] 
[normal]volunteers are my constituents.
