[[[ What should the BBC be for and what should be the purpose of public service broadcasting?]]]The raison d’etre of the BBC should be to provide the licence fee paying British public with a  first-class service which is based on integrity and impartiality and produces high quality output for all including news, current affairs, education and  entertainment.

[[[ What scope, scale and remit should the BBC have?]]]The BBC has a worldwide reputation for the quality of its journalism from highly respected BBC reporters around the world and the BBC can be proud of this record. &#xa0;However, as about 70% of the news that people ‘consume’ in this country is via the BBC, we believe that there should be a better balance in staff recruiting.  &#xa0;The BBC should always maintain the highest standards of neutrality, both factually and in its commentary.   There have been some notable deficits:  Panorama has been exposed for fabricating or skewing stories as in the programme about Primark and child labour in Bangalore; and in the coverage of Andrew Tyrie MP at the Conservative Party Conference.In an earlier study, a BBC journalist David Kerr set out to discover if the BBC is a neutral arbiter.  This study appears in Robin Aitken's book, Can We Trust the BBC?&#xa0; In a chapter entitled The Moral Maze, Kerr considers 'the population control debate'.  “The BBC generally avoids entering into partnerships with campaigning groups but Kerr uncovers a complex web of relationships between the BBC, IPPF and a charity called Television Trust for the Environment (TVE). TVE is a prolific producer of programmes about the environment, development, human rights and health issues which it sells worldwide.“TVE's relationship with Panorama was both personal - the reporter on 'Sex and the Holy City', Steve Bradshaw, is the husband of TVE's deputy director Jenny Richards - and formal - TVE co-hosted a pre-broadcast screening of 'Sex and the Holy City' followed by a debate chaired by the BBC's Francine Stock”.   “Kerr says the BBC also has a close relationship with IPPF through a project called Sexwise.&#xa0; This consists of sex education programmes&#xa0; broadcast worldwide&#xa0; and covering such 'topics as foreplay and intimacy, masturbation, homosexuality, unsafe abortion, sexual coercion, prostitution alongside subjects such as HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections and contraceptive methods for both men and women.'&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In all the programmes and accompanying&#xa0;website information and literature there are no references to social conservative teaching.“So when the BBC proclaims: 'We are independent, honest and impartial' Kerr wondered how that could be squared with the Corporation's close partnership with a pro-abortion organisation like IPPF.“ £15m in taxpayer cash is spent by the  Corporation's charity on ‘international aid’ projects (''changing lives through media and communication') including ‘educating’ Africa on climate change and a ‘romantic’ soap for Indian radio.&#xa0; The charity is called the BBC World Service Trust .......It also produces foreign sex education programmes, including an advertisement starring an Asian beauty queen emerging from a bath seductively encouraging men to use a condom.&#xa0; It has also produced a Hindi drama on relationships - 156 in the series.  The BBC’s charity gets £800,000 from the BBC, also funding from the Foreign office, the British Council, the EU and the UN, as well as cash from the charitable foundation of Bill Gates.”   [Sunday Telegraph 22 May 11]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Most recently, in 2013,  the BBC charity has been in the spotlight over impartiality of coverage of  EU enlargement since it was disclosed its Global News division received £4.5m from Brussels last year.Safermedia wonders how many licence fee payers are aware of this charity and its activities.&#xa0;Another recent example of bias, in our view, has been shown in the BBC’s attitude towards pornography.    In Radio 4 Analysis ‘Pornography: What do we know?’ on 30 June 2013 and Newsnight’s ‘Online porn boom: liberating minds or damaging brains’ on 14th August 2013, the BBC  did not provide balance or show any interest in the precautionary principle where harm is concerned;   this shows that the BBC is out of step with the majority of society which is extraordinary given the concern not just in this country but globally about pornography especially its effects on children..The licence fee should stay in order to keep the BBC as a public service broadcaster serving the licence fee payer.   There is a case for a reduction in the fee which could be achieved by scaling down the number of channels on offer for example.   Please see our views on Channel Three below.We think that the licence fee should remain with the BBC and not be given to commercial broadcasters.

[[[&#xa0;]]]-  Lord Hall recently spoke of his vision for the BBC’s future, which “belongs” to viewers.“Digital technology now means that we are able to hand to our listeners and viewers a huge amount of control that 30 years ago we kept to ourselves,” he said.“No listener or viewer should ever have to feel a sense of powerless frustration that the BBC they want has succumbed to a BBC they didn’t ask for, because in future individuals will have the ability to control the BBC themselves.”This is a rather lofty statement and we wonder what it means in practice.    Digital technology is only accessible for those who are online.    This leaves the 15% or so of people not online disenfranchised, particularly the elderly and the disadvantaged.    -Given the recent scandals at the BBC, including Savile (please see note at the end of this section*), remuneration, bias and the unseemly blame game between the Trust Chairman and the previous Director General Mark Thompson, we believe there needs to be a real change in the culture, and proper accountability to the licence fee payer, not just lip service.                                                                                        - This accountability can work more fairly if the Trust becomes entirely independent of, and separate from, the BBC Executive.   It cannot represent both at the same time.- Editorial Guidelines should be re-drafted and simplified under close scrutiny by the Trust.- In the interests of transparency and openness we also suggest that the Trust should include one member who represents the licence fee payer directly, for example a representative from an independent media charity such as Safermedia.   - A member of the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee might also be included on a rotating basis to ensure political balance.*It is interesting to note that on the subject of the Savile scandal, in June 2002 the BBC broadcast, ‘Hunt for Britain’s Paedophiles’ on BBC Two.   This programme generated large numbers of complaints for its graphic content.  The video footage, photos, ‘sex’ drawings, taped telephone conversations of paedophiles with children, and verbal descriptions (including bad language) were so explicit they might have helped to: develop an interest in paedophilia in some vulnerable adults and desensitise others;  give existing paedophiles guidance on how to target and groom children; traumatise some child viewers, or lead them to develop a precocious sexual interest and lastly create the sort of hysteria which can lead to dangerous vigilantism.

[[[ In a constantly evolving communications environment, does a 10-year Royal Charter and Agreement with the Secretary of State, together, provide the most appropriate constitutional framework for ]]]

[[[the BBC?]]]We believe it does and should continue to do so.   However, there needs to be a very different style of management and accountability if this is to work for the public good.   A little more humility and less arrogance.

[[[The BBC’s Royal Charter stat]]]

[[[es that “The BBC exists to serve the public interest” and that its main object is the promotion of the following Public Purposes:]]]The public purposes are extremely worthy but the BBC does not live up to them.   Examples of three on which we base most of our comments are: sustaining citizenship and civil society; stimulating creativity and cultural excellence and promoting education and learning.Over several years, the BBC has consistently driven down standards in some of its content and we believe this has contributed towards a coarsening of society, especially harmful to the development of good values for children and young people.   We have brought this to the attention of the BBC many times as have our supporters also.   Please see our  proforma letters of 2002 and 2007 which, while eliciting some interest from the Trust initially,  did not convert into any action to reduce the decline in standards.    Indeed this decline continues apace; increasingly, TV and radio programmes, in particular dramas, feature unacceptable levels of violent, sexual and sexually violent material and bad language. We continue to experience biased reporting of news and current affairs, indeed reports of BBC bias are far too frequent, and not without foundation.

[[[Should the BBC’s output and services be provided to any greater or lesser degree for particular audiences?]]]Lord Hall said, “Now we deliver so much more with four times more television channels, twice as many national radio stations, impressive web services and the iPlayer.” &#xa0;1.  The number of television channels. The BBC should have fewer television channels and would do well to focus on the audience as a whole, and treat everyone with equal respect and provide equal quality.   The current situation regarding television breaks the population down into groupings: the populist BBC One; the more serious BBC Two and BBC Four (BBC Four was best rated channel in 2011),  and BBC Three for younger audiences (we are not going to discuss children’s programming here).    By targeting different groups this ghettoises viewing and does little to raise aspiration or promote family viewing and link generations.   &#xa0;2.   BBC  Three.    This channel  “targets young audience as a …...place to nurture ‘talent’ for BBC One”.     BBC Three shares programmes with BBC One, apparently to provide additional chances to watch programmes which appeal to younger audience (surely BBC iPlayer does this,  so why repeat EastEnders for example, on another channel). This adds to unnecessary duplication.&#xa0;(We note the projected service licence content spend 2016/17 for  BBC Three was £85.5m and that it will see a percentage reduction of 10%.  This spend is still significantly higher than say BBC Four which manages to make good quality, informative programmes.)&#xa0;The question that must be asked is why does the BBC target young people with such down market dross and oft-repeated material?  There is the occasional good documentary but why are these not given a wider audience.   The BBC Three Controller tells us the young people like the content but is that good enough?   After all, the current younger generation has been raised on a diet of declining content standards and coarsening programming and this is what they know,  expect, and enjoy.  Much of Channel Three output is highly crass and crude ‘comedy’ (try Russell Howard’s Good News or Family Guy).    This does not offer valuable and enriching content to raise the aspirations of young people or teach them about history or the arts, or serve the public  interest  but, rather,  the opposite.   &#xa0;BBC Three caters for ages 16-34 but will without doubt attract a good many under 16 year olds who will enjoy the animations.   Many of the programmes have a warning at the beginning such as ‘Contains strong language’ and ‘Contains some strong language and adult humour’.  To access the programmes you simply have to click on a button.   There are no checks to verify age and, although the BBC does operate a parental control system, this does not seem enough given the propensity of many parents to neglect these controls as Ofcom’s ‘Children and Parents: Media Use and Attitudes Report, October 2013’ clearly shows.  It is simply not good enough to put the burden of responsibility on parents alone who are generally unaware of the content of the programmes or what their children are watching.   This is exacerbated by the variety of devices used to watch television now online especially with the rise in children using smartphones.   Given the findings of the Ofcom Report, the BBC shows an extraordinary disregard for children and young people.&#xa0;4.  A reduction in episodes of EastEnders could be undertaken especially as an increase in the  number has resulted in poorer quality and a growing trend towards sensationalism, violence and sexual content as a ploy to keep viewers watching.  Any justification for controversial storylines on the grounds of  raising difficult issues is disingenuous, and in some instances has contributed to high levels of complaints.   The bottom line seems to be ratings once again and keeping viewers in front of the television for the rest of the evening.    5.   The BBC  has been host to nudity, violence and explicit drug taking in the risqué thriller ‘Hidden’ for example.   From The Romans to Henry Tudor, Lady Chatterley’s Lover to Men Only, the BBC seems intent on reducing its drama, historical or otherwise, to the lowest common denominator.  The controversial Jerry Springer the Opera drove a horse and cart through our blasphemy laws in the face of huge public outcry.  &#xa0;Most recently  new dramas such as Escape Artist  and  Ripper Street glorify in graphic violence, sexual violence and gore.    While scheduled post the watershed such content is a problem for the many older viewers who do not  enjoy ‘gritty/edgy’ drama and are upset by being confronted with bad language, violence, sex  etc.   ‘Context’ does not dispel the effect of the image or word, even for the most discerning viewers.    It should also be remembered that scheduling does not prevent younger viewers watching unsuitable content (as commented on under BBC Three). &#xa0;On Radio 4 G F Newman’s ‘The Corruption’ attracted a large level of complaints. Other daytime programmes have also drawn complaints about their sexual references such The Archers, the Diary of Samuel Pepys and a Woman’s Hour drama.  &#xa0;In the portentous words of Aldous Huxley on Pleasures (1923): “With a mind almost atrophied by lack of use, unable to entertain itself and grown so wearily uninterested in the ready-made distractions offered from without that nothing but the grossest stimulants of an ever-increasing violence and crudity can move it, the democracy of the future will sicken of a chronic and mortal boredom.”6.   Editorial Standards

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[ ]]]Everything hinges on the

[[[ ]]]

[[[‘]]]

[[[Editorial Guidelines]]]

[[[’]]] giving details of how the language used in the Guidelines can be interpreted and how little understanding the ordinary licence fee payer has of the Guidelines which require a great deal of effort, both in time and intellectual ability, to refer to.

[[[&#xa0;]]]The BBC say they set out to apologise quickly when appropriate and respond to the issues raised.   However, apologetic responses very often leave the complainant frustrated and confused when the complaint is not upheld.For example, letters in response to a complaint say things like “We would never deliberately set out to cause offence”*; “It is inevitable that programmes which are acceptable to some will occasionally strike others as distasteful and the only realistic and fair approach for us is to ensure that the range of our output is broad enough for everyone to feel that they are catered for at least some of the time”**; “We feel that our adult audience members should make up their own minds about what they personally find acceptable and we therefore try to ensure that enough detail is given about programmes for an informed decision to be made.”; “programmes containing strong language are usually signposted by presentation announcements so that no-one will be taken by surprise.”*** ; “There is no single set of standards in this area (bad language on this occasion) on which the whole of society can agree.  The BBC has issued detailed guidelines to programme makers in order to try and minimise the risk of gratuitous offence.”****    (these BBC response comments come in one email dated 18 July 2011 Ref: CAS-869429-1H894G)&#xa0;* equally, this suggests that the BBC is sanguine if it has caused offence.**this begs the question, where is the line on ‘broad range of output’ drawn and what percentage of the time should a licence fee payer expect to find something which doesn’t offend?  And why is it ‘fair’ to cater for the taste of the lowest common denominator?*** this does not allow for channel hopping and accidentally coming across offensive material, even in programmes which sound innocuous enough.   This is a common complaint from our supporters.  **** Surely there should be certain (ethical) standards for the BBC to abide by. The BBC’s “duty to use resources efficiently and proportionately in the interests of the licence fee payers as a whole” would be easier to achieve if the Editorial Guidelines were clear and specific, thus saving a great deal of everyone’s time and energy and contributing to higher standards.    At present they are weighted in favour of editorial flexibility by being couched in permissive language.  This means that the complainant generally will receive a typical BBC brush off. It must be the responsibility of the Editor in Chief, the Director General, to ensure the Guidelines cannot be interpreted too widely by programme makers and editorial staff, also, and of equal importance, to ensure that the Guidelines are easily understood by the viewer and listener.    For too long the Guidelines have helped the BBC make a speciality of self-justification which takes time and great determination to tackle through the lengthy complaints procedure.&#xa0;It is hardly surprising then, that at a meeting with Fran O’Brien at the Trust three or four years ago  she told us they had only received one appeal on the subject of sexual content.  &#xa0;For a previous consultation, Director General, Mark Thompson, said

[[[:  ]]]“Your views help shape the decisions we take about the BBC’s services and the priorities we set the BBC’s management.”

[[[    ]]]These words appear to have been empty rhetoric most of the time.    &#xa0;The Guidelines are still lacking in clarity, ambiguous, open to interpretation and permissive, as before, serving producers’ interests rather than the interests of the licence fee payer, and causing confusion among employees as to what is and is not allowed.  What is the resultant cost of editorial and legal advice to programme makers?  If guidelines were more specific and clear cut, there would be less need to resort to such advice – so is this costing the licence fee payer more money as some producers push boundaries and editors make mistakes?&#xa0;December 2013 &#xa0;
