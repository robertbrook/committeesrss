[[[Q1]]] What types of CCS technology are currently being developed and how do they differ from one another?&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Q2 ]]]What contribution could CCS make towards the UK’s decarbonisation targets? Are the UK Government’s expectations reasonable in this regard?

[[[Q3]]] Are there any potential benefits (e.g. the ability to export CCS technology abroad) of successfully developing CCS to the UK economy and, if so, what are they?     

[[[Q4]]] What are the main barriers (e.g. economic, political, regulatory, scientific and social) to developing large-scale integrated CCS projects in the UK and internationally? How can they be overcome?

[[[Q5]]] Are there any safety issues associated with capturing, transporting and storing carbon dioxide? How could they be overcome? Who should have responsibility for ensuring these activities are safe?&#xa0;

[[[Q6]]] How have other countries incentivised CCS development? How successful have they been? How do they compare to the UK’s efforts?

[[[Q7 ]]]Is the UK Government’s approach, set out in its CCS Roadmap, likely to incentivise development of CCS in the UK?

[[[Q8]]] Could the successful development of CCS improve international efforts to mitigate climate change? What role could UK CCS play in this?  

[[[Q9 ]]]What are the consequences of failing to develop CCS and what alternatives are available for decarbonisation if CCS fails?&#xa0;August 2013&#xa0;&#xa0; http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/research/ourportfolio/researchareas/Pages/ccs.aspx http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOChooseTTS.aspx?Mode=ResearchArea&amp;ItemDesc=Carbon+Capture+and+Storage http://gotw.nerc.ac.uk/list_short.asp?searchterm=ccs&amp;Submit=Search http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPanelROL.aspx?PanelId=1-77063172&amp;RankingListId=1-19VTLF Harper, RJ &amp; Tibbett, M Plant Soil (2013) Kell, DB Ann Bot (2011) Kell, DB Phil Trans R Soc B (2012) http://www.theccc.org.uk/sectors/non-co2-gases/agriculture http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/funding/opportunities/2013/2013-gfs-sarisa.aspx  http://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/science/energy/capturing-a-cleaner-future13465.html http://dbkgroup.org/carbonsequestration/rootsystem.html  http://www.bgs.ac.uk/qics/  http://www.eco2-project.eu/ http://www.ukccsrc.ac.uk/
