"&#xa0;\nAFS0083&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Valerie Hunter&#xa0;\nEducation Select Committee   -   Academy Inquiry\n&#xa0;\n1.  Are academies as successful as they make out – or is it spin and propaganda ?\n[This is about Harris, mostly in Croydon, but no doubt applies to other academy chains.]\n&#xa0;\nPrimary Schools\n2.  \nDictatorship, hypocrisy, bullying, manipulation by Michael Gove, \nDfE\n, Harris and even Ofsted.\nMichael Gove insisting that Harris is the only sponsor acceptable to him, although the majority of parents at \nRoke\n, \nColeraine\n Park and \nDownshill\n [and others elsew\nhere] did not want them as sponsor.  Handing over schools with no subsequent control !        Dictatorship.\n&#xa0;\n3.  \nDfE\n do not look at their own verified statistics, when quoting their rhetoric.\n'Academy sponsors are assessed vigorously to ensure they have 't\nhe necessary capacity and experience to bring about improvements.'\nSo how do they explain that with \nRiddlesdown's\n help (\nRoke's\n preferred sponsor), \nRoke's\n grades went up from 64% to 80% - and that with Harris's help Peckham Park went DOWN from 90%  to 61 %.\n     Hypocrisy !\n&#xa0;\n 4.  Although they denied it, \nDfE\n bullied and threatened these three schools.  [See Google -Press Release from \nColeraine\n Park Primary Governors, for example]\n&#xa0;\n5.  Harris just come into the schools and alter what they like, irrespective o\nf the wishes of parents.\nHarris are accused of deliberately manipulating pupils' attainment data, and using American resources  [skip rope etc],  and letters home have included incorrect grammar and spelling.\nExercises also incorrect !  This is Harris's 'e\nxceptional primary team'?\n&#xa0;\n6.  Ofsted is even more worrying.\nOne inspection (20 min) said the children were bored, another that they were enjoyed the school.\nOne said they improved under \nRiddlesdown\n, but not enough !  See above re Peckham Park!\nOne said th\nat children with special needs were falling behind at the school, and the lack of support provided.     So the '\nexceptional primary team'\n now helping \nRoke\n are providing LESS support !\nThe academy management are accused of trying to force out SEN pupils by \nwithdrawing all one-to-one help in order to improve the school's league table ratings, literacy homework apparently cut and pasted from AMERICAN SOURCES - ['The children jumped rope at recess'], incorrect grammar and spelling in letters home, manipulating \ndata on children's attainment tests, and much more, including children in tears.\n(http://insidecroydon.com/2013/10/29/harris-primary-reduces-sen-support-and-adjusts-   \n&#xa0;7.  League table success apparently being more important to Harris than children who need the most help.  This is why Sponsor chains should not take over primary schools.                         --------------------------------------------\n&#xa0;\n8.  The fifth Primary school taken over by Harris, (and the\n third to object\n !)  was \nRoke\n in Croydon.  \n.\nFACT OR FICTION\n ?\n&#xa0;\n9.  By now, \nDfE\n must have known how Harris was doing with its FIRST primary school take-over.\nBut DfE IGNORED  their own verified statistics !\n&#xa0;\n10.  The first Harris take-over was Peckham Park, presumably r\nequested because the SATS were 64%.\nIn January 2013, \nDfE\n published the first SATS % grades.    [Harris Peckham Park was the\n only\n primary that had been open long enough for\n comparison\n statistics]\nPeckham Park school – last results before closure  - 90%\nHarr\nis Peckham Park – results – 61% !!!\nAnd expected progress went DOWN  from 95% for both English and Maths for community school to 90% for English and 79% for Maths for Harris !\n&#xa0;\n11.  This '\nevidence\n' of worse SATs  under Harris therefore\n did\n NOT show 'necessary improvements\n' to results at all!\nIt shows that\n Harris DID NOT have the 'necessary capacity and experience to bring about improvements'.  Quite the reverse !  \nIf this was the result after a year with their FIRST primary\n, how could they cope\n with the other three they already had – let alone take on 5 more later that year.\n&#xa0;\n12.  When challenged by \nRoke\n about this appalling drop in \nin\n SATS % at Peckham Park, the response at a meeting was 'Could have been worse'  !!!!!\nA further comment as writt\nen answer to a number of questions stated   '2011 year group were a relatively able group – 2012 were less able'.\n&#xa0;\n13.  This must apply to MOST schools whose grades went down for one year (\nRiddlesdown\n for example a drop of 10%  for GCSE/Equivalents, NOT 2\n9% as Harris Peckham Park), but they are called 'failing' !     But Harris Merton went\n down 13% !!     Harris failing ?\n&#xa0;\n14.  A 29% drop in SATS at a\n school\n would have had an immediate take-over on the cards – but not for a Harris Academy.     Instead,\n knowing these results, DfE still forced Roke to become a Harris Academy against the wishes of most parents.        [ A cynic could suggest that Harris wanted this school for  a feeder for its \nPurley\n one, instead of \nRiddlesdown\n.]\n&#xa0;\n15.  The Ofsted Reports for H\narris Peckham Park  January 2013 (\na year and a quarter after being taken over)\n gave '\nREQUIRES IMPROVEMENT' [3] for '\nAchievement of pupils', '\nQuality of Teaching' and '\nLeadership and Management'.\nAnd exactly the\n same\n 'requires improvement' grades for\n Harris\n \nChafford\n Hundred\n  (the second primary taken over by Harris) in November 2012.\n'Your Thurrock  2\nnd\n January 2013 'Ofsted has told Harris Primary that it requires improvement, or risks being put in\n Special Measures\n' !!    Follow-up Report 19\nth\n March still cr\nitical.\nSO WHAT HAPPENED TO HARRIS'S 'EXCEPTIONAL PRIMARY TEAM' ?\n&#xa0;\n16.  'Consultation' revealed that 94% of parents did not want to be taken over,  but if they had to become an academy, 81% did not want Harris as sponsor.\n&#xa0;\n17.  With \nRoke\n, for the third \ntime in a row, Harris had been\n forced\n on parents against their will – consultation ignored.\n&#xa0;\n18.  'The outstanding team of teachers and leaders were not in place when the SATS\n [Peckham Park]\n were prepared and taken, and have the expertise needed to give \nRo\nke\n the support it needs.'\nWhere were they then that Peckham\n Park reduced by so much under Harris, and \nChafford\n Hundred risked going into special measures ?\nHow could Harris be allowed to take over  more schools when they hadn't got this team in place for t\nhe first one to improve in over a year ? [They told \nRoke\n that there would be\n evidence of acceleration\n of children's progress in the first two terms !\n Not\n  \nDETERIORATION after four terms for Peckham Park and one at \nChafford\n Hundred !!]\n   How many 'extra' teams are NOT in place for the other 4 schools to be taken over in 2013/14 ?\n&#xa0;\n19.  When \nRoke\n asked about 'LONG TERM experience' – the reply was '\nWe have recruited a team\n \nof outstanding teachers\n led by Sir Robin Basher who have proven go\nod and outstanding teaching and outstanding schools'.\nBut Sir Robin had recently joined.  \nWas that long-term experience  on Primary schools !\nThey also responded  to the \nquestionaire\n from \nRoke\n with\n 'Support from outstanding primary teachers to support impr\novement for 2 to 3 days a week on average.  Regular support from Robin Basher about a day a fortnight.'\nAnd 'currently planning 5 primaries including \nRoke\n' – '3 more outstanding Primary Advisory Teachers are being recruited.'\nAnd  \n'Can support expansion at\n 8 to 10 additional schools a year.'     \nAnd \nDfE\n are letting them !\n&#xa0;\n20.  Lord Nash, the Under-Secretary for the \nDfE\n, in a letter to the local MP. Sir Richard \nOttaway\n who favoured \nRiddlesdown\n for the take-over, stated that Harris is a\n 'strong and\n proven\n sp\nonsor'.\nAnd with  \n'an exceptional primary team'          \n[He obviously is incapable of reading \nDfE's\n verified statistics too.)\n&#xa0;\n21.  He also writes\n 'The formal consultation is usually started when the proposed sponsor has been identified by the Department\n,\n the governing body has met with, and\n agreed to be sponsored by this sponsor.'     !!!!!!      Not according to Coleraine Park, Downhills and Roke&#xa0;\n                                 ----------------------------------------                           \n    \n22.  Secondary Schools\nHarris Academies claimed great success in Croydon – BUT IS IT SPIN ?\n&#xa0;\n23.  Harris Crystal Palace\nAlready a very academically successful City Technology College – renamed an academy with\n£9m of taxpayers' money funding.\nSPIN  -  \nSaid to have 10 applicants for every place – but 2011/12  figures published in the local papers (I can't find later) show that there were 2110 applications, but only  543\n first\n choices – i.e. the other 1567 (three quarters of the applicants) put down betwe\nen 1 and 5 other schools\n in preference\n !    This is deliberately misleading parents.\nCounting all 6 choices as popularity, even the most unpopular school in Croydon is over-subscribed\n&#xa0;\n24.   2012 VA score shows Crystal Palace with the\n lowest\n score [998.3] of all Harris Academies and most Croydon schools.\nDoes this mean that Crystal Palace concentrated on getting the most pupils with C for English/Maths, and ignored giving effort, encouragement etc to those  who should have got a B or A instea\nd.\nExclusions. - 2009/10  5\nth\n highest out of Croydon's 22 state schools\n                      2010/11 joint 7\nth\n     -  2011/12 10\nth\n.\n&#xa0;\n25.  Harris South Norwood\n£32m of taxpayers' money rebuilt this school with new equipment and facilities giving them a \ngreat advantage over other schools.\nSPIN  -  1220 applications, but only 287 first choices – the other 933 wanted SOMEWHERE ELSE\n&#xa0;\n26.  The official yearly intake was 210 pupils,, only it appears that they did not take in other children, in spite of shortag\ne of places  for another 4 years    [ in respective years 105, 91, 95, 108.]\n[Did they get funding for the children they would have in the future that helped give additional attention to those already at the school, and boost results ?]\nSPIN  - The 2011 ve\nrified results showed for the first time a breakdown of the 5 A-C GCSE results including Maths and English into two columns – GCSE ONLY and GCSE/Equivalent.\nSouth Norwood's figure\n dropped from 75% to 46%  (29% !!! - the\n biggest\n decrease of Croydon's 27.   \n22 state schools, and 9% higher than the one in second position !\nAs the 'Equivalent' figure is the only one published in the local paper, and by Harris, this gives parents a totally misleading impression that 75% were 'good' GCSEs.\n&#xa0;\n 28.  Exclusions \n:  2009/10 – the most in Croydon : 2010/11 – the 2\nnd\n highest  :  2011/12 – the third highest!                                        \n&#xa0;\n29.   \nHarris \nPurley\n£18m of taxpayers' money spent on new facilities and equipment.\nSPIN - Continually referred to by Har\nris as underachieving and failing, nothing could be further from the truth.\n Five years or so previously the school had been at rock-bottom, bad \nreputation,so\n would not be academic.   But five years later their CVA improvement score from what they were exp\nected to get was in the top 3% in the country and the 2\nnd\n highest in Croydon !   [Ignored ]\nScience up to 75% from 54%, and all other columns in \nDfE's\n verified performance tables up\n ABOVE\n Croydon average, including 5 A-Cs, Level 1 English/Maths, and Modern\n languages.\nThe joint English/Maths up 8% from 18% to 25 % was the\n ONLY\n GRADE BELOW !- AND THE ONLY GRADE TAKEN ANY NOTICE OF!\nNational Challenge Inspectors said that the pupils would pass the then required 30% in the summer [they did- 33%] and would conti\nnue to rise as the school had more academic  pupils – which they did – but\n Harris unfairly claimed credit that THEY had turned the school around\n !\nThe school's final Science figure was 94% in 2009 – up from 27% in 2007, and other subjects continued to rise\n.\nThe unpopular jibe was also untrue. September 2008 190 pupils turned up for 180 places !\nBut the Council said the school was going to close and be moved to the far north of the borough which accounted for the low first choice for 2009.\nSPIN -  In 2011 th\ne GCSE ONLY grade drop from 61% to 42%, Equivalent. (3\nrd\n highest in Croydon).  Again parents misled by higher figure.\nIn 2012 \nPurley\n only entered an average 6.3 GCSEs  - only Harris Peckham was lower.\n&#xa0;\n30.  Baccalaureate\n – In 2012  South Norwood 4%.  \nPurley\n 3%.\nMost other Harris academies elsewhere 5% or under !\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n33.  It seems to me that too many academies are more interested in prestige than welfar\ne of children.\nThe non-academic are just as important.  A child who gets support and improves their score from that expected is more likely to adopt a good attitude to work, and be a success, even if not academically.   This continual 'failing' label is di\nsastrous.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
