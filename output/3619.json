"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by ActionAid UK and ActionAid Myanmar &#xa0;&#xa0;About us&#xa0;ActionAid International started engaging in Myanmar on a limited scale in 200\n1\n through the then Asia Regional \nO\nffice \nbased \nin Bangkok\n. \nActionAid Myanmar \n(AAM) was formed \nin 2007, \nreflecting \nthe belief that influence should be nurtured from within the country. \n&#xa0;\nOver the last 10\n \nyears, \nAAM\n \nhas \nengaged with the most marginalised ethnic minorities\n. \nAs of January 2013, AAM’s programme covers more than 700 communities in 26 townships \nin\n \n8 states/regions\n. It\n supports around 180 000 people in partnership with 17 local organisations. Along with community-led \nempowerment\n work, AAM is \nalso heavily\n involved in national policy \ndiscussions\n. Our current annual budget is around 6 million USD.\n&#xa0;\nThe underlying principle of ActionAid’s approach in Myanmar is to develop the leadership skills and potential of committed Myanmar youth, particularly young women\n,\n through an innovative Fellowship Programme\n that is\n central to all our work. The programme aims at identifying young people (Fellows) in rural communities and equipping them with the skills, knowledge and confidence needed to stimulate participatory development in their villages and engage with local authorities to ensure sustainable local development.\n&#xa0;\nActionAid’s policy initiatives, participatory and rights-based approach and competence in Disaster Risk Reduction \nha\nve\n \nmade us an influential voice within the international development sector in Myanmar.\n&#xa0;\nDrawing on \nour\n long experience \nin \nMyanmar\n, this submission highlight\ns ActionAid’s view of the \nkey\n development \nchallenges and opportunities in the country, \nto inform \nthe IDC\n on key areas of work where we think \nDFID could make \nprogress. \n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;SUMMARY&#xa0;ActionAid welcomes this inquiry. Myanmar, with its long history of political struggle, is now at a juncture where people want to take an active part in the change process. Since 2011 there have been remarkable changes in Myanmar yet despite the political progress it remains one of the poorest countries in Asia. Only the right type of development and the full and active engagement of the population will help ensure a transition to justice, peace and sustainable development for all \nof \nMyanmar’s people. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Key challenges to development in Myanmar and related recommendations to the UK government&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe multiple transitions \nthat \nMyanmar is \nrapidly \nundergoing – from a military government to a multi-party democracy, from a centralized to a market economy and from engaging in multiple conflicts to striving for peace – are\n \nextremely demanding. Ministers, senior government officials and parliamentarians are grappling with complex reforms that will have a profound impact on the future shape of Myanmar. However, few have had the chance to develop the skills and experience necessary to manage such far-reaching reforms\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nIt is critical that the international community supports the government in its efforts to bring positive political, social and economic change. However, for the international community to maximize their contribution, their support must be balanced - respecting the leadership of the Myanmar people and not imposing ideals from \noutside\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCurrently much of the support being provided by the international community is not focused on building the capacity of the government to deliver services and secure the rights of citizens. Much development aid remains targeted towards other agencies such as the UN and International NGOs. While we understand the need to fund a stable transition, one consequence of this is the creation of parallel\n \nservices \nrather than \ninvesting in the capacity of \nthe government \nto provide\n essential \npublic \nservices such\n as free universal primary education.\n \n&#xa0;\nThe UN and International NGOs are well placed to help the people of Myanmar, but development aid should \nreinforce rather than \nbypass government\n completely\n.\n \nIt \nshould aim to facilitate long-term state-building and the development of capacity to deliver stable and high-quality public services, especially for the poorest and most marginalized people in the country. \nBudget \nor sector \nsupport is one key way of doing this.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThroughout its history, the goal of sustainable peace in Myanmar has remained unreachable because of identity-based differences, leading to long-standing conflicts and displacement. It is clear that conflict will continue until all people in \nMyanmar, regardless of their ethnicity or religion, feel that they are being respected and treated as equals\n. They need to\n have\n confidence in the justice system, \nenjoy\n \nequal human rights, and be able to access education, healthcare, a livelihood, \nwhile having religious \nfreedom\n and\n political autonomy.\n&#xa0;\nThrough their aid and technical support, the international community should encourage the government to be inclusive and ensure justice and equality for all. Donor countries should promote fiscal and administrative decentralization and more autonomy for \nboth \nstate and regional governments. Direct bilateral aid and partnership with state and regional governments would promote more equal development and empower the \nlevels of \ngovernment \nthat work\n most directly with the people.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe prevailing economic model focuses on increasing industrialization, with the promise of “quick wins” through economic growth \nwhich,\n it is hoped, will provide employment opportunities for a huge, unskilled and un/under-employed workforce. \nHowever, \nall \nt\noo often there is a tendency to ignore the potential marginalizing impact \nthat \nsuch an approach to “economic growth” \ncan have \non the majority of the population\n:\n rural farmers engaged in the agriculture sector. \n&#xa0;\nIt is critical that the international community supports a model of economic development which is inclusive of the majority, and which ensures their continued access to and control over their resources. Too \ngreat a\n \nfocus on “quick growth” and too rapid a transition from an agricultural to an industrialized \neconomy\n \ncould\n \nresult in widespread marginalization, inequality and shocks to society which \nmay\n \nbe irreparable. Too rapid a transition might be detrimental to the achievement of just and sustainable development.\n&#xa0;\nAt the same time, the investment and trade interests of the international community must consider the development needs of Myanmar. Investment should \nat the very least \n“do no harm”. For example, it should ensure that it does not exacerbate conflict; contribute to land grabbing or similar confiscation of people’s resources\n. It should go further and promote inclusion \nand avoid \nmarginalization\n of local business\nes\n and local entrepreneurship. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nMyanmar’s transition to a modern, developed nation is threatened by persistent and widespread gender inequalities. Patriarchy is deeply rooted in the culture, society, governance systems and institutions\n. This has been\n reinforced over decades by a male dominated\n,\n militarized society. Institutional arrangements have been accepted and leadership generally perceived as a male prerogative. A clear manifestation of this is the severe under-representation of women in leadership and decision making roles in parliament, in government and in the private sector. Typically women’s rights are regarded as not being an issue in Myanmar, or secondary to the pursuit of ending ethnic conflict or pursuing economic development etc. That women’s participation and leadership are not understood to be integral to the achievement of such processes is highly problematic. \n&#xa0;\nSpecific and targeted budgets and \nprogram\nme\ns\n are critical to ensure there is solid investment in promoting women’s participation and leadership at all levels so that gender inequalities can be challenged and women’s rights \nabuses addressed. \nM\nain\nstreaming gender across sector budgets and programmes is\n not sufficient\n on its own\n to achieve the necessary access to opportunities and justice for women and girls.\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
