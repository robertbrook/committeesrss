"Written evidence submitted by Freedom from Torture (LAI 005)&#xa0;\nTorture\n survivors will be adversely affected by:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFreedom from Torture &#xa0;\nFreedom from Torture, formerly known as the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, is a UK-ba\nsed human rights organisation and one of the world’s largest torture treatment centres.  \nSince our foundation more than 25 years ago, more than 50,000 people \nhave been referred to us \nand we currently have centres in London, Manchester, Newcastle, Birmingham and Glasgow.  \n&#xa0;\nThe organisation exists to enable survivors of torture and organised violence to engage in a healing process to assert their own human dignity and worth.  \nOur concer\nn for the health and wellbeing of torture survivors and their families is directed towards providing \nmedical, psychiatric and psychological consultation, assessment and treatment, short and long term rehabilitation through social care, casework and counsel\nling, psychotherapy, physiotherapy, complementary therapies, group and family work, as well as practical assistance with accommodation and welfare agencies.  Our holistic approach recognises the wellbeing of the whole person and that absence of access to j\nustice to secure protection and welfare and housing impacts adversely on torture survivors and can inhibit the efficacy of therapy.\n&#xa0;\nFreedom from Torture also accepts instructions for the preparation of forensic medico-legal reports documenting torture in \naccordance with the international standard set out in the Istanbul Protocol and the organisation prepares \nbetween \n300-600 medico-legal reports per year.  It is also our mission to educate decision-makers and the public about torture and its consequences, w\nhile our advocacy work strives to ensure that the UK and other states honour their international obligations with regard to torture.\n&#xa0;\nTorture survivors and the UK asylum system&#xa0;\nTorture survivors are among the most vulnerable of asylum seekers\n.\n \nMany \nsuffer \nfrom the consequences of torture for years \nafter its infliction\n and struggle to rehabilitate as they progress through the asylum system\n here in the UK\n. \nFailure by \nthe Home \nOffice \nto \nidentify\n survivors of torture \nduring the screening \nand substantive \ninterview \nprocess\nes\n,\n \nleading to a \nfail\nure \nto apply relevant law and policy\n,\n is a pervasive problem\n. \nThere is also a culture of disbelief within the Home Office which compounds the difficulty that many torture survivors experience in disclosing torture to g\novernment officials and leads to incorrect assessments of credibility and mishandling of medico-legal evidence of torture injuries. \nTh\ne\ns\ne problems\n lead to flawed decision\n-\nmaking by the Home Office\n which protracts the asylum process and exacerbates mental health difficulties associated with torture\n that survivors struggle to cope with\n. \n&#xa0;\nAgainst this backdrop, access to high quality, specialist legal advice is essential to ensure protection is grant\ned as quickly as possible to torture survivors \nwho require it\n and that their other rights are also protected\n. \n&#xa0;\nAccess to justice is an important element of the right to rehabilitation, guaranteed to torture survivors by Article 14 of the UN Convention Aga\ninst Torture. In its recent General Comment on this article of the \ntreaty\n, the Committee Against Torture emphasised that ‘\nthe provision of means for as full rehabilitation as possible for anyone who has suffered harm as a result of a violation of the Conve\nntion should be holistic and include medical and psychological care as well as \nlegal\n and social services\n’\n (emphasis added).\n The Committee also affirmed that\n States parties to this treaty must ensure that access to justice is available to all torture victims including ‘asylum-seekers, refugees or others under international protection’. The UK has been a party to this treaty since 8 December 1988.  \n \n&#xa0;\nWe regret\n that the government did not await the outcome of this inquiry by the Joint Committee on Human Rights before finalising and publishing its response to the Transforming Legal Aid consultation \nconducted \nearlier this year.\n \nThe proposals will affect many vulne\nrable groups, including torture survivors, and it is imperative that careful scrutiny of their human rights impact is undertaken before any reforms are finalised and implemented.\n&#xa0;\nResidence Test&#xa0;\nThe introduction of a test requiring one year of lawful resi\ndence before becoming eligible for\n civil\n legal aid is likely to be found unlawful\n in \na number of respects\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe residence test would have a deleterious impact on survivors of torture recognised as ref\nugees or granted subsidiary protection:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe residence test would \nimpede access to justice for \nsurvivors of torture who\n have \nbeen refused \nasylum and have not \nyet \nsubmitted a fresh \nasylum \nclaim\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe residence test would have a \ndetrimental \nimpact on survivors of torture at the end of the asylum process\n \nwho \nare appeal rights exhausted\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe\n residence test would also be unworkable:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Paying for permission work in judicial review cases&#xa0;\nFreedom from Torture is concerned\n at the proposal\n \n(as modified) \nthat\n there should be discretion given to the Legal Aid Agency to pay pr\noviders\n \nfor work done prior to permission being granted for judicial review \n(the original provision\n was that no\n fees would be paid unless permission w\nas\n granted). T\nhe effect of this proposal \nis likely\n to reduce the availability of \nspecialist \nlegal advice and representation \npertaining \nto judicial review across many areas of decision-making by public authorities a\nffecting survivors of torture. \nWe welcome the in\ndication\n in Annex B\n that there will be further consultation on this in a separate paper as the criteria for exercising such discretion and how often it would be applied will \naffect\n whether or not lawyers are \nprepared to take instructions on such cases. \n&#xa0;\nIt will be clear from \nexam\nples given above that judicial review provides torture survivors with an important legal safeguard against poor quality decision-making by the Home Office, local authorities (especial\nly in relation to social services and housing departments) and a range of other public authorities. Typical examples of flawed decisions by public authorities concerning our clients include failure to consider fresh representations as a fresh asylum claim,\n delays in deciding asylum claims (in some cases for three years or more), \nrefusal of permission to appeal to the \nAsylum and Immigration Chamber of the Upper Tribunal, failure to properly assess eligibility for entitlements including community care support\n, and failure to comply with policy concessions relating to torture survivors (for example with respect to the frequency of reporting\n for those seeking asylum\n).\nOur clients are \nalready \nexperiencing difficulty in finding specialist \nlegal representation for j\nudicial\n \nreview actions following the \nprevious \ncuts to legal aid in April of this year. \nFreedom from Torture is concerned that placing applications for judicial review ‘at risk’ will\n further\n restrict legal practitioners’ capacity\n in this area\n,\n \nthereby\n reduc\ning the availability \nto our vulnerable clients \nof legal advice and representation \nrelating to judicial review matters\n.  \n&#xa0;‘Borderline’ cases&#xa0;Freedom from Torture is disappointed that the Government intends to remove legal aid for\n,\n in particular\n,\n housing, welfare and asylum cases with only a \n‘\nborderline\n’\n prospect of success.\n&#xa0;\nMerits in asylum cases are difficult to assess as country situations often change more quickly than case law or country specific information and policies giving guidance on \nthe factual human rights situation in specific countries or in respect of specific groups.  The accounts of individual applicants escaping torture and persecution may provide evidence that has not yet come to light and challenges existing knowledge and cas\ne law with regards to situations of torture.\n&#xa0;\nThe asylum and human rights protection cases of survivors of torture a\nre\n \nfrequently highly complex.  Evidence in the case may develop over time.  Survivors of torture may be traumatised by their experience and \nneed time and the development of a relationship of trust in order to be able to give a full account of their experiences of torture.  \n&#xa0;\nFreedom from Torture is concerned that the civil legal aid funding system incentivises legal practitioners, especially t\nhose who are less experienced, to avoid taking on complex cases, with the risk that survivors of torture are unable to challenge decisions refusing protection and placing them at risk of removal to situations where they face torture and other forms of pers\necution.\n&#xa0;\nThe current funding regime allows legal aid to be provided in cases considered to be \n‘\nborderline\n’\n if the life, liberty and phy\nsical safety of an individual are\n affected, if they are at risk of homelessness or if the case would involve a breach of\n human rights protected \nby the European Convention on Human Rights. Freedom from Torture considers that these safeguards are an essential means of ensuring that deserving cases including those involving torture survivors, often involving risk to life and p\nhysical safety, are brought before the courts.\n&#xa0;Experts’ fees&#xa0;\nAs described above, the medico-legal reports commissioned from Freedom from Torture\n’s \nM\nedico \nL\negal \nR\neport \nS\nervice\n, are often crucial in the proper determination of an asylum claim from a torture survivor. The current fee levels allowed are insufficient to meet the full costs of this \nservice \nwhich\n has to be subsidised from charitable funds\n. This \ncontributes to a\n limit\nation \non the number of\n reports \nwe \ncan provide\n and the speed with which we can produce them\n. \nA\nny further erosion of fees payable by the Legal Aid Agency \nfor expert reports of this sorts \nis likely to \nimpact detrimentally on the accessibility of our service (\nand the services of other providers\n of medico-legal reports relating to torture\n) to \ntorture survivors. \n&#xa0;In many cases torture survivors need expert interpreters to help elicit \nproperly the details of \nthe abuse they have suffered and any diminution in rate\ns payable \nis likely to drive specialist interpreters from this market which would in turn compromise the ability of \ntorture survivors\n to communicate clearly what has happened to them\n. The vocabulary\n and understanding of clinical issues\n, \nas well as the \nemotional \ndemands of this work, make specialist interpreting provision for this vulnerable group especially important\n.\n&#xa0;27 September 2013\n7\n&#xa0;\n The Committee Against Torture’s General Comment 3 (2012) on Implementation of article 14 by States Parties is available at \nhttp://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cat/comments.htm\n. \n The \nPoverty Barrier, The Right to Rehabilitation for Torture Survivors in the UK,17 July 2013 \nhttp://www.freedomfromtorture.org/sites/default/files/documents/Poverty%20report%20FINAL%20a4%20web.pdf\n \n"
