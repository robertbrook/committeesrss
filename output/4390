defaultFood security is a broad theme which encapsulates challenges to Governments and society over a wide range of topics.  It links to global agricultural production and markets, competitiveness, population growth, poverty, env
defaultironmental impacts and technological developments. Activities across 
defaultG
defaultovernment and internationally are trying to address these challenges. They are challenges that cannot be addressed by the UK alone, but rather by the UK as part of an international commu
defaultnity.

default&#xa0; 
defaultThe 2011 Government Office for Science’s Foresight Report, ‘The Future of Food and Farming’ explored the increasing pressures on the global food system between now and 2050, and asked how a future global population of 9 billion people can all be fed
default healthily and sustainably.
default 
defaultIt stated that o
defaultn the demand side, global population size will increase from nearly seven billion today to eight billion by 2030, and probably to over nine billion by 2050; many people are likely to be wealthier, creating demand
default for a more varied, high-quality diet requiring additional resources to produce. On the production side, competition for land, water and energy will intensify

default&#xa0;defaultUK food security – key messages default6.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK currently enjoys a high degree of food securitydefault in terms of access,
default availability, resilience and variety of food supply.  This is built on both a strong food production base in the UK and access to a wide variety of markets through the EU and an open, rules-based world trading system. 
defaultUK food security is supported by cons
defaultumer prosperity and income, which is addressed through the Government’s focus on growth
default.
default7.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe evidence for this is in the 
defaultUK Food Security Assessmentdefault, published in 2010
default,
default which analysed the different factors impacting on UK food supply.  
defaultIt

default 
defaultIn 2012 officials reassessed the report and concluded that
default it still represents a robust analysis of food security in the UK.

default&#xa0; 
defaultWhile there are a number of working definitions of food security, the common elements of these definitions are the availability, access, affordability, safety and resilience of food. T
defaulthe

defaultUK Food Security Assessment
default 
defaultanalysed the UK’s food security position across six themes relating to these elements – global availability, global resource sustainability, UK availability of access, UK food chain resilience, household food security, and sa
defaultfety and confidence.
default9.
default&#xa0; 
defaultEach theme consists of a headline indicator, which captures a major or representative element of the theme, and several supporting indicators which explore related aspects of the theme. 
defaultIn 2012, an 
defaultinternal analysis 
defaultof these indicators
default 
defaultconcluded that the 2010 Assessment remained valid in the medium term but would be updated at 6-8 year intervals if warranted. This reflects the fact that many of the indicators in the assessment are relatively slow-moving or reflect structural issues whic
defaulth do not tend to see significant changes over a short period of time.  However, some indicators have 
defaultchanged
default slightly since the
default a

default, global resource sustainability
default. But even taking these changes into account
default and
default given the wide range 
defaultof 
defaultfactors 
defaultthat frame UK food security
default,
default the overall assessment remains very positive.
default10.
default&#xa0; 
defaultOverall, the Assessment concluded that the UK is well placed to deal with future challenges, though the Government continues to monitor the long-term trends that affect our 
defaultability to continue to enjoy affordable, safe, nutritious and sustainable food. One clear message is that the UK’s food security depends on being able to source from a variety of stable countries, including domestic production: this diversity of supply enh
defaultances security by spreading risks, widening options and keeping prices competitive. Open markets and trade remain the best ways to enable the UK to stay resilient and food secure.

defaultBefore
default addressing the eight issues on which the Committee has invited evidence, it may be helpful to set out the Government’s overall approach to the food sector.
defaultThe Government’s approach to defaultthe defaultfooddefault sectordefaultThe Government champions a thriving, competitive 
defaultBritish food and farming sector, driving sustainable growth in the wider rural economy in support of rural communities. The food chain has a key role to play in restoring growth to the economy – food and drink is the largest manufacturing sector in the UK,
default and the food chain as a whole accounts for 7
default.4
default% of national GVA, and 3 million jobs. Moreover, it is a sector that has continued to grow throughout the recent economic downturn.
defaultThe Government is supporting the food sector to continue to grow through a ra

defaultthrough a range of measures to build resilience and remove barriers to the sector’s success. These include,
default 
defaultfor example:
defaultBuilding resilience in a global context
defaultThe policies highlighted above focus on what the Government can do within the UK to help the agri-food sectors be the best they can be to contribute to growth and take advantage of expanding world markets, but the UK cannot be seen in isolation. World mark

default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultOverseas trade and inward investment
default are vital for the UK’s prosperity. The Government aims to help UK businesses succeed internationally and encourage overseas companies to work with the UK. The UK Government is working actively through the EU and internationally to reduce barriers to trade
default and improve market access multilaterally through the World Trade Organisation as well as through bilateral free trade agreements.  It is also working with industry to open up priority export markets with third countries, and supports companies to understa

default cleared through customs. Given that the price
default,
default and hence
default,
default value of agricultural commodities on international markets is volatile, AVE tariff figures related to agriculture can be quite variable between years. Nevertheless, it is clear that the EU still applies markedly high tariffs on imported livestock, dairy a
defaultnd sugar products which act to significantly increase the price of those commodities in Europe. Accordingly
default,
default these tariffs not only raise the price of food to consumers but also harm the competitiveness of the European food manufacturing industry who have 
defaultto pay more for their inputs. 
default&#xa0;defaultBiofuelsdefault16.
default&#xa0; 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the context of rising demand
default, 
defaultand against the backdrop of future climate change, biofuel policies have been cited as potentially increasing risks to food security.  The Government believes that the primary goal of agriculture must be food production and that the production of biomass f
defaultor bioenergy must not undermine food security in the UK or internationally. 
default&#xa0;
default17.
default&#xa0; 
defaultTo the extent that biofuels and biomass policies result in an increase in aggregate demand for agricultural feedstocks and/or agricultural land, they will result in higher agricu
defaultltural product prices over the medium term than would have otherwise been the case.
default 
defaultRecent analysis by Defra’s modelling team suggests biofuels support at the EU level could have a medium-term price impact on feedstocks used for biofuels production. Averag
defaulte EU wheat and oilseed prices are projected to be 5% and 17% higher than without EU biofuel policy with knock on impacts downstream in the vegetable oil market. This is broadly consistent with modelling by others.
default 
default&#xa0;
default18.
default&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthere is a distinct question about the 
defaultextent to which biofuel policies have contributed to recent international agricultural price spikes. 
defaultA
default thorough cross-Whitehall analysis of the agricultural price spikes of 2007/8 concluded that biofuels had a relatively small contribution in 2008, particu
defaultlarly as far as wheat was concerned. However, that report also raised a question about the impact of biofuel support policies on the volatility of international prices. 
default&#xa0;
default19.
default&#xa0; 
defaultI
defaultn the Government’s 2012 Bioenergy strategy
default, 
defaultwe explored mechanisms for mitigating ag
defaultricultural price spikes through introducing flexibility into biofuels mandates or other measures
default. This work reveal
defaulted
default the significant potential associated with a mechanism that allows market forces to direct grain between biofuels, animal feed and food markets during a temporary supply shortage and price spike. The report did not examine specifically the implications of 
defaultthis idea for
default bioenergy markets and stopped short of examining a particular mechanism. We are considering further work to appraise the merits of more specific proposals. 
default&#xa0;
default20.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Government continues to negotiate within Europe to ensure that food production r
defaultemains at the core of the EU’s consideration of biofuel policy and to promote the development of ‘advanced biofuels’ derived from wastes and residues, which could significantly reduce the direct competition for food feedstocks.
default In addition the UK has suppo
defaultrted 
defaultthe 
defaultwork
default of the UN and the World Bank
default to develop the Responsible Agricultural Investment principles (RAI) and the Voluntary Guidelines on land use which will help to set voluntary international standards for investment in agricultural production inclu
defaultding biofuels. 
default&#xa0;
defaultProductivitydefault&#xa0;default21.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe CAP, trade barriers and biofuels policy all matter because of their direct impacts on food prices.  They also matter because of their impact (along with, for example, R&amp;D) on agricultural productivity.  
defaultR
defaultecent Defra 
defaultmodelling demonstrates the potential benefits
default of agricultural productivity
default.  Assuming that efficiency and productivity improvements in the EU express themselves as yield improvements, and that annual yield improvements were to be double 
defaulttheir current (rela
defaulttively low) 
defaultlevel,
default the impact on EU 
defaultagricultural prices relative to a 2020 baseline would be significant: 18% lower for wheat, 31% lower for coarse grains (maize and barley), 16% lower for beef and veal, 9% lower for both poultry and pork, 21% lower for m
defaultilk and butter, and 19% lower for cheese. 
defaultIn 
defaultall of the commodities referred to, both the EU production figures and net trade position would also be higher/better than the 2020 baseline projections. The estimated impact on 2020 prices (as well as 
defaultproduction and the trade balance) is even more significant for grains and meat, if instead one assumes that the EU12 close the current productivity gap with the EU15 by 2020.
default&#xa0;
default22.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWhilst it may be difficult to model precisely the productivity impact of any giv
defaulten policy reform, it is clear that modest improvements in productivity result in tangible improvements in consumer prices. 
defaultA
defaultgricultural productivity matters for a whole range of reasons, including food security.
default&#xa0;defaultCommon Fisheries Policydefault (CFP)default23.
default&#xa0; 
defaultFishing at su
defaultstainable levels, and removing the waste of discarding, will allow us to maximise the yield we can take from our seas in the long term, providing a more stable supply of fish to EU consumers.  Growing populations, growing demand for protein, and growing aw
defaultareness of the problems facing the marine environment should provide real opportunities to market and profit from stocks that are managed well.
default24.
default&#xa0; 
defaultEU Member States reached agreement to a historic deal to reform the 
defaultCFP
default in June this year.  Despite a difficult 
defaultand protracted negotiation, the UK stood firm on its key priorities, securing a robust ban on the discarding of fish with binding timelines, a process for regionalised decision-making, and legally binding commitments to fish sustainably. 
default25.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThese reforms are
default expected to become law from January 2014, and will benefit fishermen, the food supply chain, and the marine environment.  The reforms agreed provide a crucial opportunity to overcome the failings of the past and put the CFP on a sustainable footing, safeg
defaultuarding the supply of fish to UK and EU markets for future generations
default.
default 
default26.
default&#xa0; 
defaultImprovements to the CFP’s external dimension will also ensure we apply the same principles of sustainability outside EU waters as within.  Europe is the world’s biggest fisheries mark
defaultet and can play a vital role in the global governance of fish stocks and delivering a sustainable future. 
defaultResource efficiency in the food and drink supply chaindefault27.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAs part of its wider work to make sure the UK has a secure, environmentally sustainable, affor
defaultdable supply of food, the UK government is encouraging the UK food and drink industry to use resources more sustainably. Lead trade associations and major businesses have developed sustainability strategies
default,
default e.g. the British Retail Consortium’s ‘A Better R
defaultetailing Climate’, and the Food and Drink Federation’s ‘Five-fold Environmental Ambition’.
default28.
default&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, the situation is patchy and further action is needed to improve resource efficiency. Rather than turning immediately to regulation to drive change, the Gove
defaultrnment aims to encourage collaborative voluntary
default action
default. The Product Sustainability Forum (PSF) action on groceries, 
defaultthe 
defaultSoft Drinks Roadmap
default,
default and the UK Statement on Sustainable Palm Oil are recent examples.
defaultFood wastedefault29.
default&#xa0; 
default The UK is committed to playing its part in global efforts to reduce food waste, 
defaultincluding post-harvest losses,
default 
defaultwhich in turn will reduce the environmental impacts of the food supply chain, and save valuable resources such as water, land and energy used to
default produce food which ultimately is not eaten. In 
defaultaddition, it will deliver a more efficient supply chain where supply and production of food will be closer to the requirement of consumers. 
default&#xa0;
default30.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK is
default seen as a leader in the EU on food waste prevention. We 
defaulthave worked very successfully with industry to reduce supply chain food and packaging waste by
default 
default7.4%
default 
defaultover the last 3 years, while household food waste is down by even more - 15% since 2007. This has been achieved through initiatives such as the Courtauld Co
defaultmmitment voluntary agreement with the retail and manufacturing sector (the latest phase of which
default 
defaulthas prevented a total of 1.7 million tonnes of food and packaging waste, saving
default 
defaultaround £3.1bn), the Hospitality and Food Service Agreement, and by supporting W
defaultRAP’s Love Food Hate Waste campaign, which helps consumers make informed choices on reducing food waste and save money.

defaultThe EU Commission’s 2011 
defaultRoadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe
default outlines a competitiveness and growth plan for 2050 that is based on a sustainable use of natural resources. The Roadmap identifies the food and drink sector as key priority area in view of its environmental impacts and has a milestone to reduce the food 
defaultchain’s resource inputs by 20% by 2020. It also states that the Commission will assess how best to limit waste throughout the food supply chain, and consider ways to lower the environmental impact of food production and consumption patterns via a

defaultGovernment has

default other Member S
defaulttates 
defaultregarding
default the communication on sustainable food. Defra met
default members of the food and drink sector before responding to the Commission’s consultation in October. Defra also convened a meeting between interested parties and the Commission to ensure that the Commission is aware of the many sustainability and resource-
defaultefficiency initiatives undertaken by the UK food industry in recent years. During 2013, Government also brought together a wide range of stakeholders to discuss the role of diet and consumption in the sustainability of the food system, and the roles of dif
defaultferent sectors (consumers, media, private sector, government) in addressing consumption patterns.  
defaultThe relationship between the price of food and the cost of producing itdefaultKey points:defaultDetail:default33.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK food chain 
defaultis competitive relative to many other European countries. According to Eurostat, food prices in Germany are 2% more expensive than the UK. In France
default,
default they are 5% more expensive, and in Ireland 13% - UK consumers are benefiting from our competitive market. 
default34.
default&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, in a competitive market there is less slack when underlying prices do rise. So when there are changes in the fundamental drivers of food price inflation (commodity prices, exchange rate, oil prices), consumer prices will adjust to those underlyin
defaultg changes. Whilst 
defaultour 
defaultfood prices have risen faster than our neighbours, the 
defaultaverage
default 
defaultprice of food remains lower.

defaultT
defaulthe aim of the GCA is to promote a stronger and more efficient groceries market
default,
default bringing better value to consumers through increasing trust between suppliers and retailers by changing their behaviour to follow the Groceries Supply Code of Practice. 
default37.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultGCA will help to ensure a fairer relationship between big retailers and their suppliers by supporting innovation and investment and preventing supermarkets passing on excessive risk and cost to suppliers.
default 
defaultThis will provide greater stability throughout the 
defaultsupply chain and help consumers, who will benefit from a more robust groceries market.

default defaultThe implications of volatility in thdefaulte global food supply and demand for UK food securitydefaultKey points:defaultDetail:defaultAgriculturaldefault commodity marketsdefault40.
default&#xa0; 
defaultPrice volatility is an inherent characteristic of global agricultural commodity markets and has long characterised them. This is due to the dependence of production on weather patterns, the relative insensitivity of demand to food price changes, and produc
defaulttion lags.  
default41.
default&#xa0; 
defaultSome degree of price volatility is therefore normal but volatility tends to be highest in ‘thin’ international markets where a small proportion of global production is traded (
defaulte.g.
default, the global rice market) or when there are adverse policy resp
defaultonses to market developments such as export bans. 
defaultHowever historic attempts to manage price levels and/or reduce price volatility have been unsuccessful.
default42.
default&#xa0; 
defaultDespite the agricultural price spikes experienced in 2007/8 and more recently, there is little evidenc
defaulte to suggest that price volatility has increased over time. Indeed, analysis for the Foresight report concluded that agricultural price volatility over the two most recent decades has generally been lower than in the 1970s and 1980s. Furthermore, it should
default be noted that spikes seen in the early 1970s were far larger in real terms (i.e. accounting for inflation) than recent spikes. 
default43.
default&#xa0; 
defaultHowever there is a risk that price volatility (and the frequency of price spikes) could increase in the future, mainly due to m
defaultore volatile energy prices and extreme weather events associated with climate change. Conversely, increased trade between countries, deeper international markets for agricultural goods and the avoidance of adverse policy responses should act to reduce futu
defaultre price volatility.
default44.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt is important to bear in mind that the volatility (and level) of commodity prices is of more importance to consumers in developing countries than in developed countries. This is firstly because poorer individuals spend a much greate
defaultr proportion of their income on food, and secondly because in developed countries the price of food to consumers is often only weakly connected to the cost of basic commodities, with other inputs like energy, labour and packaging being more important. For 
defaultexample, the price of wheat accounts for only 11% of the cost of a loaf of bread in the UK. 
default45.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAlthough commodity prices are only weakly related to the 
defaultlevel
default of some prices, modelling
default demonstrates that alongside exchange rates and oil prices, they are the l
defaultargest drivers of 
defaultinflation
default in retail food prices. 
default46.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWhilst global commodity markets have significant impacts on retail food price inflation, there is a lag between commodity price rises and their impact on retail food price inflation if for example, there 
defaultmay be contracts in place which prevent the full price increase being immediately passed on. Given that: contracts may be of differing lengths; price changes of different commodities are not perfectly correlated; and that there are other, non-commodity pri
defaultce factors driving food price inflation, then any volatility on commodities markets will be significantly moderated before their transmission to consumer prices.   
defaultSpeculationdefault47.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Government recognises that there is a range of views in respect of the role
default that may have been played by commodity speculation in recent food p
defaultrice spikes. On balance, reliable evidence suggests
default scepticism that speculation in agricultural futures markets has played a significant causal role in agricultural price volatility. However, the Government continues to monitor relevant research with interest. 
default48.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt is also important to note that trading in 
defaultcommodity markets plays an important role in providing liquidity in these markets and that liquidity is essential to the effective functioning of these markets. Against the backdrop of climate change, and the possibility that international agricultural pri
defaultces may become more volatile over time, the role of agricultural futures and options markets and the liquidity they rely on, become more important.
defaultVolatility and developing countriesdefault49.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK Government recognises the damaging impact of high food prices and
default food price volatility on poor consumers in developing countries.
default 
defaultHigh price volatility reduces the benefits of higher prices for net producers. For food producing households, price volatility makes the returns to increased production more uncertain and so
default acts as a disincentive to further investment.
default 
defaultDfID and Defra are planning research to better understand the extent to which commodity price changes impact on consumers, producers and poverty in the developing world.
default50.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK Government believes that free tr
defaultade and effective and efficient markets provide a greater level of food security than large-scale, public food stocks designed to manage price volatility at national or international level. Experience to date suggests such stocks are expensive to run, with
default implications for fiscal positions, and are likely to crowd out private sector stocking initiatives and would therefore not necessarily stabilise prices. D
defaultf
defaultID supports, in principle, proposals for regional emergency humanitarian food stocks in high risk re
defaultgions such as the Sahel, to improve the speed and effectiveness of the 
defaultresponse to humanitarian disasters. Carefully targeted social safety nets are also important to help poor consumers in developing countries cope with price inflation.
default51.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK Government 
defaultis working internationally, particularly with other members of the G20, to liberalise trade and make commodity markets function more efficiently. The Government is promoting greater sharing of information on existing stocks, and discouraging disruptive act
defaultions such as export bans, which limit supplies and drive up prices.
defaultAMISdefault52.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Agriculture Market Information System (AMIS) is a G20 initiative which seeks to improve agricultural market transparency, information sharing and facilitate policy coordination be
defaulttween major producing, exporting and importing countries. A central task is its work to develop indicators to monitor market and policy drivers that impact on global food prices and global food price volatility. The AMIS Rapid Response Forum promotes early
default discussion between countries concerning abnormal market conditions and allows for the development of shared strategies. AMIS will not necessarily prevent price increases or some level of volatility but can help improve understanding of markets and enhance
default policy coordination in times of crisis. 
default53.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAMIS has made valuable progress since it was initially set up two years ago.  The UK is an active participant in all aspects of AMIS’ work and encourages the contribution of timely and high quality data around key 
defaultindicators, such as stock levels, from all members through the Global Food Information Group.

default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Government’s Agri-Tech Strategy
default published jointly by BIS, Defra and DfID in July 2013, aims to re-position the UK as a world leader in the global challenge of the sustainable i
defaultntensification of agriculture, producing more with less input and impact. Government is investing £160m in translational research led and co-funded by industry to strengthen links between science and technology to drive innovation and its uptake into farmi
defaultng to improve the efficiency, cost effectiveness, and productivity in agriculture; increase access and uptake of knowledge transfer; and promote better access to international markets and export opportunities. 
default56.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe are also working with the Technology Strat
defaultegy Board 
default(TSB) 
defaultto drive innovation to support a more competitive, resilient and sustainable agri-food sector via the £90m
default Sustainable A
defaultgriculture and Food Innovation Platform; £4.5M investment in a new Sustainable Intensification Platform to help translat
defaulte knowledge into practice to help farmers; and the £70m Agri-tech Strategy’s catalyst innovation competitions with industry led by TSB (with a £10m contribution from DfID for pro
defaultjects in developing countries.)
default57.
default&#xa0; 
defaultMore widely, Government is building links to s
defaulttrengthen multi-disciplinary research to address food security through EU initiatives such as the Joint Programming Initiative on Agriculture, Food Security and Climate Change
default,
default and the European Research Area Networks in developing 
defaulta 
defaultcommon research agenda 
defaultacross Europe; and working closely with the European Commission and other Member States in developing research work programmes under the EU’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation 
defaultprogramme. 
defaultThe UK is also colla
defaultborating internationally with Df
defaultID and the Chi
defaultnese Ministry of Agriculture on food security via the Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network (SAIN) and in the Global Research Alliance to find ways to reduce agricultural 
defaultGHG
default emissions.
defaultGM and emerging technologiesdefaultGenomicsdefault58.
default&#xa0; 
defaultGenomics utilises the recen
defaultt acceleration in gene sequencing technology that has been researched and pioneered in the UK. It allows marker genes to be identified that correspond to the desirable traits observed in naturally occurring varieties of crops. By applying genomics (in a wa
defaulty that was not possible a decade ago) crop varieties can be selectively developed by means of an acceleration of the natural selection process.
defaultGenetic Modificationdefault59.
default&#xa0; 
defaultFrom the scientific and other evidence it is clear that the responsible use of GM crops cou
defaultld play an important role alongside other options to help ensure food security.  This conclusion has been supported by a number of important reviews in recent years which have highlighted how science and technology, including GM, will be crucial to making 
defaultagriculture more efficient and sustainable.
default  
default60.
default&#xa0; 
defaultGM technology is already contributing to UK food security via the extensive use of imported GM livestock feed, soya in particular. 
defaultThe l
defaultivestock sector could not operate at the same level without the use of 
defaultimported supplies at prevailing prices.
default 
defaultThe majority of global soya production is now GM and this is cheaper than conventional soya.         
default61.
default&#xa0; 
defaultA major barrier to the development and use of GM crops in Europe is the operation of the relevant EU controls. The
default process for authorising GM cultivation is dysfunctional because there is no political consensus on this issue, and only one GM crop has secured EU approval since 1998. The uncertainty around the approval process has deterred GM-related investment and inno
defaultvation, denying EU farmers and consumers the benefits that would be expected to flow from this.
default 
defaultA recent European Court of Justice ruling has prompted the European Commission to call for a vote by EU Ministers on a GM insect-resistant maize variety. This w
defaultill be the first such vote since 2007 and may end the current moratorium on authorisations for GM cultivation.  
default62.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe
default negative EU situation is damaging for the future of agriculture both in Europe and in developing countries which may be influenced by it. 
defaultA
defaults
default 
defaultthe
default disparity between the EU and other parts of the world on GM uptake continues to grow, this in itself poses a potential threat to our food security. It creates the possibility for traces of non-EU approved GM material to be found in imported commoditi
defaultes like soya.  This undermines the ability to maintain orderly and cost-effective supply chains on which the UK relies.  
default63.
default&#xa0; 
defaultOutside Europe
default,
default GM production is already significant whilst in the EU only one GM crop is being grown on a limited scale (an insect-re
defaultsistant maize of no UK interest).
default 
defaultThe main existing GM crops offer easier weed and pest control but a range of other GM traits have been commercialised or are in
default the development pipeline.
default 
defaultThis includes drought-tolerance, disease-resistance, nitrogen-use ef
defaultficiency, and improved nutritional characteristics.
default64.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAs a specific example of how GM cultivation could help the UK, blight-resistant potatoes have been developed which could significantly improve production of this important crop.  It could mean a marked 
defaultre
defaultduction in the use of fungicides and an increase in production as losses to the disease are curtailed.  The company BASF had applied for EU approval of a GM blight-resistant potato but later withdrew the application because of the difficult EU situation.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe full potential contribution of GM production to the UK will clearly depend on the range of new crop traits that might be developed and adopted over time.    
default65.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Government will continue to argue for the EU to operate a more sensible GM regime. 
defaultThe UK

default pragmatic and proportionate controls which enable fair market access for GM products that pass a robust safety evaluation. Domestically we are open to, and want to encourage, GM crop research. In recent years there have been several publicly-funded
default research projects in England which have involved GM field trials (work on GM nematode-resistant potatoes by Leeds University, on GM blight-resistant potatoes by the Sainsbury Laboratory, and on GM aphid-repellent wheat by Rothamsted Research). The UK has 
defaulta world-class plant science base and should therefore be in a strong position to contribute to advances that will improve food security both at home and in developing countries, including through realising the potential of GM plant breeding.

default&#xa0;defaultRisks to disruption of the food chaindefault&#xa0;
default68.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence and Security Review recognised the risk from natural disasters as one of the top tier risks facing the UK, and made the continued provision of essential services in such circumstances as one of the Gover
defaultnment’s highest resilience priorities. 
default69.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn support
default of
default 
defaultthis review,
default the Critical Infrastructure Resilience Programme within Cabinet Office developed a systematic, co-ordinated, cross-sector campaign to reduce the disrup
defaulttion caused by natural hazards/
defaultdisaste
defaultrs to the UK’s critical infrastructure and the essential services they deliver. 
default70.
default&#xa0; 
defaultA key output from this programme is the development of Sector Resilience Plans, produced annually by Lead Government Departments working with their infrastructure owners and r
defaultegulators.  The Plans are part of an ongoing assessment to increase Government’s understanding of the level of resilience of the UK’s critical infrastructure to natural hazards.  
default71.
default&#xa0; 
defaultDefra works with the food industry to promote an understanding in the releva
defaultnt government departments of its dependencies. Defra set up and chairs the Food Chain Emergency Liaison Group
default, 
defaulta forum at which other government departments, industry, and the relevant trade associations can share information and jointly consider resilienc
defaulte issues. This Group meets 3 to 4 times a year and on a regular basis as required.
default72.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK Food Security Assessment highlighted that further planning was required to ensure the UK was able to maintain supplies in the event of disruption to ports, as the maj
defaultority of the UK’s
default food imports arrive that way. 
defaultDefra identified the food products vulnerable to port disruption
default; and it is
default 
defaultworking with the 
defaultDepartment for Transport (DfT) to identify the major ports used for the import of these food types and identify sub
defaultstitute facilities in the event of disruption. The information gathered from these exercises will allow Defra and DfT to work with industry to agree a national plan to manage key food supplies. 
default73.
default&#xa0; 
defaultDefra has also commissioned research that seeks to address bu
defaultilding the resilience of the food supply chain in the event of a potential major east coast flooding event, and in response to other extreme and volatile weather events.
default 
defaultThe Government Chief Scientist’s Food Re
defaults
defaultearch Partnership has also reviewed the evid
defaulte
defaultnce underpinning 
defaultresilience of the food supply including risks from cyber terrorism, extreme weather and regulatory obstacles. 
defaultRisks to food safety default&#xa0;
default74.
default&#xa0; 
defaultFood safety law specifies requirements including the absence of 
defaultpathogenic micro-organisms
default and safety for consumption
default, and the 
defaultFood Safety Act 1990 provides the framework for all food legislation in the UK.
default 
default75.
default&#xa0; 
defaultGovernment has a responsibility to ensure that food law is upheld and consumers are protected, but the primary obligation to ensure that f
defaultood supplied is safe to eat is placed on food businesses. Food businesses must tell the FSA where they have reason to believe that a foodstuff that they have imported, produced, manufactured or distributed does not meet food safety requirements, and must u
defaultse their own approach to exercise due diligence over the food they sell to ensure they are meeting safety and authenticity requirements.  Businesses agree specific specifications with suppliers and suppliers are subject to inspection by such businesses as 
defaultwell as local authorit
defaulties
default. Many large food businesses also conduct their own testing of food samples.
default76.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe central competent authority in the UK for monitoring and controlling the application of food law is the Food Standards Agency (FSA).  
defaultHowever, t
defaulthe maj
defaultority of surveillance and enforcement activity to protect the consumer is undertaken locally by local and port health authorities. Local authority staff routinely inspect premises on a risk basis as well as collecting samples which are tested for food safe
defaultty or compositional and labelling compliance.  In 2010-11 89% of food businesses checked were broadly compliant with food safety law.
default77.
default&#xa0; 
defaultRegulation (EC) 178/2002 lays down the EU principles and requirements of food law.  It applies to all stages of production
default, processing and distribution of food and feed.  Around one fifth of all spending to 
defaultcheck for compliance with food law is at the stage of slaughterhouses, cutting plan
defaultt
defaults and primary producers. 
defaultThis reflects EU prescription, the relatively high safety risk
default of food handling at these stages, and the need to track raw meat to the farms and suppliers for both animal and human health purposes.
default78.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe FSA recognises however the need to rebalance assurance activity so that it more accurately reflects the risk associa
defaultted with today’s food prod
defaultucts and longer supply chains. 
defaultThe FSA has been taking a lead in influencing at an EU level for changes to official controls so that they are more risk based and proportionate.
defaultRisks to plant healthdefault79.
default&#xa0; 
defaultPlant health is now one of Defr
defaulta’s top 4 priorities with increased resources for operational activity and research. 
defaultDefra has 
defaultdeveloped a prioritised risk register, working with the relevant industry sectors and work has also started on plant health contingency planning. 
default80.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe current bo
defaultdy of EU legislation covering the agri-food chain including plant health consists of almost 70 pieces of legislation
default, 
defaultand the European Commission has adopted a proposed package of measures aiming to cut this down to 5. 
defaultThe UK is
default committed to pursuing a new
default regime with faster decision making in response to plant health risks, better risk targeting of such threats and improved enforcement of the rules. 
default81.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWhile 
defaultDefra
default 
defaulthas 
defaultcreated the UK Plant Health Risk Register, potential instability in global food supply from
default shock events is also recognised in the UK Food Security Assessment as a dependency
default.
default82.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn the area of food security with developing countries, 
defaultDefra is
default working with UK-CDS in the design of the Natural Hazards Risk Register to deliver early warning for overse
defaultas support. In its final form it should also provide early warning of potential crop pest events that may affect UK food supply and security.
defaultRisks to animal healthdefault&#xa0;default83.
default&#xa0; 
defaultOne of Defra’s priorities is to minimise risks and increase preparedness for animal diseas
defaulte outbreaks, driving growth and competitiveness through improving standards of animal health and welfare.
default&#xa0;defaultAnimal disease outbreaks and contingency plansdefault default&#xa0;default84.
default&#xa0; 
defaultPublished contingency plans set out how an outbreak of exotic

default&#xa0;
defaultFood fraud and labelling default&#xa0;default85.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe horsemeat incident at the start of 2013 highlighted the 
defaultpotential impact of a food fraud on the resilience of the food supply chain.  The incident saw the mass recall of a number of products across the EU and had a serious impact on consumer confidence in the food that they were buying or being served.  
default86.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAn ind
defaultependent review of Britain’s food system was launched in June 2013 and will report by Spring 2014.
default 
defaultThe review will focus on consumer confidence in the authenticity of food and will identify any weaknesses in food supply networks which could have implicatio
defaultns for food safety and public health.
default 
defaultIt will look at the causes that enabled horsemeat fraud, the roles and responsibilities of businesses to 
defaultconsumers and how to support consumer confidence.  Findings will be used to form recommendations to Government on
default how the UK can increase the resilience of its food systems to fraud.
default87.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Government is clear that food fraud is completely unacceptable. Consumers must have confidence in the food they buy and have every right to expect that food is correctly described. T
defaultransparency is key to confidence
default.
default88.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Government will do whatever is necessary to ensure that British farmers and food manufacturers have access to export markets.  This includes making sure British food is recognised for its rigorous standards and traceab
defaultility, and that our producers do not get a bad reputation due to the Europe-wide horsemeat incidents.
default 
defaultWe are working hard to help the British food and farming sectors make the most of their excellent products and high standards.
default89.
default&#xa0; 
defaultFood businesses have howeve
defaultr a legal responsibility to assure traceability.  This means that a food business supplying food products from other food businesses is responsible to its customers for ensuring that everything it sells is safe and is as described.  Such businesses therefo
defaultre must by EU food law assure themselves of the nature, quality and description of what they are supplying.  
default90.
default&#xa0; 
defaultOn labelling, the food industry is ultimately responsible for making sure that labelling on food is accurate and consumers are not misled. The UK 
defaulthas supported more and better country of origin information that is targeted at meeting the needs of consumer. 
defaultWhether climate change risks are adequately incorporated in UK food security strategies and planningdefaultKey points:defaultDetail:defaultClimate change anddefault projecteddefault impacts on volatility default91.
default&#xa0; 
defaultDefra recently commissioned a review of the literature on global food security modelling with a focus on climatic factors. Of models that explicitly co
defaultnsider scenarios around climate change, it is projected that climate change will generally tend to reduce yields at the global level – although there are stark differences in impacts across regions – and raise crop prices. However, there are still key evid
defaultence gaps around the impacts of CO
default2
default levels and precipitation patterns on crop yields which mean such results should be treated with caution. The IPCC suggest that extreme weather events could have a more significant impact on food security than gradual cli
defaultmate changes, though such extreme weather events are typically left out of formal modelling exercises because their location, severity and nature are not known. 
default92.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt is acknowledged that in light of climate change, international trade will become more 
defaultimportant in managing volatility and mitigating global price rises from harvest disruption and extreme weather events.
defaultUK Climate Change Risk Assessment default93.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn January last year Defra published the first UK Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA), as required by the Climate Change Act 2008, which brought together the best available evidence using a consistent framework to identify the risks and opportunities rel
defaultated to climate change. 
default94.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe CCRA assessed climate risks for the UK using the UK Climate Projections (UKCP09) for three time periods – 30-year periods centred on the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s and three emission scenarios. The CCRA classified risks and opportu
defaultnities into three broad impact classes, ‘low’, ‘medium’ and ‘high’ and also identified those risks that are highly uncertain and difficult to quantify. 
defaultThe method focused attention on risks where decisions need to be made in the near future (i.e. in the ne
defaultxt 5 years).
default95.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe CCRA identifies a number of impacts on domestic agriculture. These impacts include increasing water demand coupled with decreasing availability, drier soils, reduced soil quality and soil erosion, increased flood risk to high quality agric
defaultultural land and the impacts of heat on livestock productivity and welfare. The changing climate may allow new pests, diseases and other invasive species to enter the country, or allow existing examples to spread further or become more of a risk. An increa
defaultse in extreme weather events such as droughts, floods and severe storms could result in unexpected reductions in productivity.
default96.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThere is also the potential for positive impacts of climate change, including increases in yield and productivity of existing cro
defaultps and grassland as well as the opportunity to introduce new crops. However these opportunities will only come 
defaultto pass if other factors which a
defaultffect growth, such as water availability, are not limiting.
default97.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe second CCRA is currently being scoped and will be
default published by January 2017. Defra is working closely with other Government Departments and interested parties to ensure that we identify the most important areas 
defaultfor the assessment to focus on.

default&#xa0; 
defaultSustained growth in the food and drink in
defaultdustry is a priority for Defra. 
defaultThe UK has a long, proud and strong heritage of producing high quality, safe and excellent tastin
defaultg food. The sector is important to the UK, contributing £96 billion annually
default. 
defaultThere is a wide range of food and drink that is known throughout the world.
default I
defaultn 2012 UK exports amounted to £18.2bn - nearly 50% higher than a decade ago. Scotch Whisky exports ar
defaulte nearly £4.3bn and we export over £2bn of meat.
default101.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe increasing global population, rising middle class and incomes are leading to demand for western products and so represents opportunities for UK producers. There is huge potential to export more to establ
defaultished and also high growth markets in Brazil, Russia, India and China, where these currently represent only 3% of our total export market.
defaultBarriers to exportingdefault102.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThere are existing studies that highlight barriers, or obstacles, to export, including: 
default103.
default&#xa0; 
defaultA Defra funded 2012 report by University of Plymouth
default,
default ‘Obstacles to export growth for small and medium sized Agrifood companies’
default,
default found that obstacles to exporting experienced by agrifood SMEs were broadly similar to those identified in other sectors, with the most significant barriers being finding 
defaultmanageme
defaultnt time, identifying who to make contact with, dealing with legal or tax regulations or standards overseas and protecting IP. 
default104.
default&#xa0; 
defaultSimilarly, amongst agrifood businesses that did not export, the most significant perceived barriers were finding the necessary ma
defaultnagement time to devote to doing business in an overseas country, followed by the costs associated with doing business overseas.
defaultThe Food and Drink Exports Action Plandefault105.
default&#xa0; 
defaultGovernment and 
defaulti
defaultndustry are therefore working together to promote UK industry and access
default markets.  The Exports Action Plan first launched in 2012 outlined this joint work. The Plan was refreshed in the autumn of 2013 to reflect 
defaultG
defaultovernment commitment to increase exports by delivering half a billion pounds of value to the UK economy through ass
defaultisting up to 1,000 food and drink companies with their international growth
default,
default and contributing to wider aims to increase exports by at least £1bn by October 2015. 
defaultThe full list of commitments can
default be found in the 
defaultAction Plan
default.
default 
defaultThis includes
default 
defaultbrigading 
defaulti
defaultndustry and Government to create a single strong UK brand identity to increase the visibility of UK food and drink 
defaultat the world's major food events and exhibitions
default,
default and work to lift trade barriers, promote trade and maintain access to markets already opened.

default&#xa0; 
defaultUK

defaultRole of innovation defaultin defaultremovdefaultingdefault obstaclesdefault107.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Government recognises the need to remove key obstacles to scientific development in the UK and its uptake into practice by farmers to support access to
default marke
defaultts
default, 
defaultand is working towards boosting investment in innovation.
default&#xa0;
default108.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn the agriculture sector, we understand that the small average size of farm businesses
default can limit ability to invest in
default and adopt innovations owing to the costs associated with acquiring reliable information on new technologies and processes
default,
default and the practical difficulties of protecting intellectual property, brands and trademarks, whilst
default also
default recognising that being small 
defaultcan also bring advantages to implementing change.
default&#xa0;
default109.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe are taking steps to simplify funding and intellectual property arrangements and ensure business participation and practical translation of resear
defaultch through a number of channels, e.g. through the Agri-Te
defaultch Strategy
default.
default&#xa0;
default110.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Technology Strategy Board’s (TSB) Sustainable Agriculture and Food Innovation Platform also provides a key route to support innovation through funding of industry-led collaborative research and development with the academic research base.
default This is funded jointly with Defra, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) and the Scottish Government, providing government investment of up to £90m over five years.  
default&#xa0;
default111.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAdditional targeted instruments include the Crop Improveme

default&#xa0;
defaultWays of increasing self-sufficiencydefault in products for which the UK has a comparative advantagedefaultKey points:defaultDetail:defaultSelf-sufficiency and the production to supply ratiodefault112.
default&#xa0; 
defaultSelf-sufficiency is used to convey different meanings by different commentators. It is often used as shorthand for the production to supply ratio.
default113.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe pro
defaultduction to supply ratio also takes into account net trade. Given that we export significant amounts of indigenous food, the proportion of food that is consumed domestically from domestic production is lower than the production to supply ratio. For 2012, th
defaulte UK’s production of indigenous type food, that is, food stuffs that the UK can produce domestically, was 76% of total supply. These figures have fallen in recent decades from their peaks in the 1980’s. However, the production to supply ratio in this perio
defaultd was inflated by the effect of the CAP, which resulted in Europe-wide surpluses and unnecessarily high prices for consumers. Taking a longer view of history, the current production to supply ratio is similar to that of the second half of the 19
defaultth
default 
defaultc
defaultentury.
default Indeed it is higher than that of the first half of the 20
defaultth
default century, at some points very significantly so, even until into the 1960’s. 
default114.
default&#xa0; 
defaultComparative advantage is an economic concept which states that a country will specialise in, and therefore export, prod
defaultuction of a good in which it has a relative cost advantage. In practical terms, comparative advantage is revealed by a country’s pattern of trade. For products in which the UK has a 
defaultcomparative advantage, the UK will therefore already have production in ex
defaultcess of consumption: in other words, the UK will be a net exporter of that product. The production to supply ratio figures illustrate that the UK does not have a revealed comparative advantage across food production in general. 
default115.
default&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, there may be secto
defaultrs where the UK could increase the production to supply ratio, through cost-effectively increasing overall production. It would be up to producers whether any increase would be supplied to the domestic or export market. The Government is exploring areas wh
defaultere there may be barriers to UK producers from fully exploiting their comparative advantage and accessing the domestic market, as well as breaking down barriers to UK food and drink exports accessing foreign markets. The key to UK producers exploiting mark
defaultet opportunities at home and abroad is competitiveness – improvements in productivity will allow producers to compete with international producers of equivalent goods, though market access barriers imposed by importing can make it difficult for exporters t
defaulto fully exploit their comparative advantage. 
default116.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt is up to the food supply chain to innovate and invest in order to improve their productivity
default 
defaultand take advantage of export opportunities, but Government’s role is to ensure that the policy and regulatory environment assists industry as much as possible in doing so. Improvements in productivity which lead to the UK increasing its production will ben
defaultefit the food chain and the UK economy more generally. 
default117.
default&#xa0; 
defaultDefra continues to work closely with industry to identify policy and regulatory issues which may impact on the competitiveness of the sector.  The Secretary of State met representatives from across th
defaulte industry and the devolved administrations in July 2013 to discuss how to increase the competitiveness of the sector.  Issues being explored following that discussion include the importance of taking forward EU negotiations on labelling to make it easier 
defaultfor consumers to identify where their food comes from, exploring sector-specific issues, examining how we can overcome any barriers to domestic producers competing effectively for public sector contracts, and ways of supporting growth in the food and drink
default sector at local level.
defaultIncreasing market share for products in which the UK has a comparative advantagedefault118.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Government’s goal is to support and develop British farming, to encourage sustainable food production, and a sector which is more productive and co
defaultmpetitive. Our role within that is to help create the right conditions and remove obstacles so that farming businesses can operate successfully, increase their productivity, and respond to market signals and demand.
default119.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe take a range of steps to help support
default the industry in this respect: as stated, we have been seeking to reform the Common Agricultural Policy to reduce the industry’s dependency on direct subsidies over time. We are currently consulting on the implementation of the new CAP, including how we mi
defaultght use the future Rural Development Programme for this purpose. Support for innovation and technology are key factors in improving the industry’s productivity, as set out in the Agri-Tech Strategy and explored in this paper.
default120.
default&#xa0; 
defaultDuring 2011-2012 we worked in 
defaultpartnership with the food and farming industry and environmental organisations to examine how we might increase food production whilst improving the environment. This triggered a range of new activities, such as the creation of a ‘Sustainable Intensificati
defaulton Research Platform’ and a ‘Future of Farming Review’. This review was undertaken by a core group of key individuals from across the farming sector who examined issues such as routes of entry into employment in agriculture, barriers to starting these care
defaulters and how new entrants can be better supported. The Review reported in July 2013 and the group are working jointly with Government and wider industry to take forward the recommendations.

default&#xa0; 
defaultGoing forward, we need to attract the brightest and best entrepren
defaulteurs to the farming profession and to the food sector more generally. Government works with the industry-led skills agenda, supporting development of the highly skilled workforce the sector will need for the future. 
default122.
default&#xa0; 
defaultSince 2011, we have worked with the Nat
defaultional Skills Academy for Food and Drink to support the Skills Action Plan for the Food Supply Chain, which aimed to tackle skills shortages in the food supply chain.  Earlier in 2013, the National Skills Academy announced that their target for creation of 
default50 000 apprenticeships across the food supply chain had been exceeded.  More recently, the food and drink sector has signed up as part of the first group of Apprenticeship Trailblazers developing new apprenticeship standards and assessment approaches.  201
default3 has also seen the launch of the innovative MEng in Food Engineering at Sheffield Hallam University and the associated National Centre of Excellence for Food Engineering, and further innovative work to encourage young people into the sector by the Food an
defaultd Drink Federation and the IGD.

defaultThe UK’s comparative advantage does not only relate to the nature of our geography and environment, but also to the areas where we have developed a strong skills capability and reputation. Our industry has high standards of 
defaultanimal health and welfare and traceability,
default 
defaultand we have highly innovative food manufacturing and retailing sectors. The Government will continue to look for ways to promote these, and to champion the industry within domestic and international markets.
defaultAnndefaultex A – Summary of the UK Food Security Assessment 2010defaultT
defaulthe 2010 UK Food Security Assessment represents the most current and complete analysis of the risks and
default challenges to UK food supply. A summary of each theme, and its assessment in 2010, follows:
defaultHeadline indicator: Global food output per capita
defaultGlobal production of food relative to population is a fundamental in
defaultdicator of global food security. 
defaultGlobal supply underpins UK availability and prices
default.
defaultSupply will need to meet growing 
defaultglobal demand and deal with emerging climate challenges. Well-functioning markets are needed to spread these risks and send the right production and investment signals.
defaultCurrent status: Green. 
defaultAssessment: F
defaultood supply has outgrown population, but 
defaultthere are 
defaultchallenges ahead, including equitable distribution
default. The 
defaultability of international and regional markets to bring supply and demand into line is a real strength, but it does not necessarily guarantee that everyone is fed or that natural resources are 
defaultsustainably used. For the medium term, the uncertain effects on the supply side of climate change and the challenges facing developing countries to increase production suggest an amber rating.
defaultHeadline indicator: Global land 
defaultuse change
defaultClimate change is likely to create new stresses on natural resources. Food must be produced in a way that is environmentally sustainable or we will set up problems for the longer term.
defaultCurrent status: Amber. 
defaultAssessment: It is unclear 
defaulthow much f
defaultorest loss 
defaultis 
defaulta
defaultttributable to food production and that there has been 
defaultsmall rise in farmland use since 1990s
default. As
default the trend in the reduction of fore
defaultst areas is likely to continue, a red rating is given for the medium term. 
defaultHeadli
defaultne indicator: Diversity of UK supply
defaultSourcing nutritious food from a range of stable countries including domestically enhances security by spreading risks, widening options and keeping prices competitive. 
default 
defaultGateways into the UK are a key element of the UK’s
default food infrastructure.
defaultCurrent status: Green.
defaultAssessment: 
defaultThe UK‟s openness to trade has brought a very impressive diversity to UK food supply.
default 
defaultThis openness ensures that UK food supply is very resilient to supply interruptions from specific countries and a
defaultlso from within the UK
default 
defaultwhile noting a critical dependency on our sea ports
default.
default A green rating is given for the medium term. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHeadline indicator: Energy dependency of UK food chain
defaultUK food supply depends upon sophisticated and comple
defaultx chain
defaults
default and infrastructure, and is particularly dependent upon energy supplies in their various forms. Industry needs to manage a range of risks and disruptions to supply chain. Diversity is a key element of resilience, and also scale.
defaultCurrent status: Amb
defaulter
defaultAssessment: 
defaultThe domestic food chain is 
defaulta heavy user of energy but intensity is falling. 
defaultThe surge in energy prices in 2007-8, and their continued 
defaultuncertainty, can be expected to 
defaultincrease the incentives to reduce energy intensity along with pressures for
default lower carbon production and distribution. 
defaultIt is expected that
default these favourable trends to continue into the future.
default A green rating is given for the medium term.
defaultHeadline indicator: Low income households' share of spending on food
defaultEveryone should have the opportunity to ac
defaultcess and afford a healthy diet. 
defaultThe aim of the headline indicator is to monitor the impact of price rises on the affordability of food, where affordability is measured by share of spending on food.
defaultCurrent status: 
defaultAmber.
defaultAssessment: Households’ share of spending on food
default 
defaultincreased in 
default2
default008-9 because of inflation, but has remained relatively stable in the last few years and is 
defaultexpected to fall again once incomes recover
default. A green rating is given for the medium term: res
defaultumption of economic growth is expected, 
defaulttogether with declining or stable real food prices, to result in 
defaulta declining share of spending on food.
defaultHeadline indicator: Cases of food borne pathogens
defaultPublic confidence in the UK food system
default rests primarily on food safety. Assurance schemes seek to build this confidence. Consumer perceptions also matter.
defaultCurrent status: Amber. 
defaultAssessment: 
defaultCampylobacter and salmonella
default cases have been
default down since 2000
default,
default but listeria up. Reducing food-born
defaulte illne
defaultss is a top priority for the 
defaultFood Standards Agency, so 
defaultfuture improvements are expected, with a green rating given for the medium term.

defaultAnnex B: defaultRussia case studydefaultThis i
defaultndustry could not access a valu
defaultable Russian market in beef and ruminant meat becau
defaultse of 
defaulta thirty-year long ban imposed due to BSE. 
defaultDefra worked with British Embassy 
defaultin 
defaultMoscow and the Russian 
defaultauthorities
default to 
defaultremove this
default ban. 
defaultThis required sustained
default pressure at official and political level
default over the last 30 years
default, 
defaultaccommodating
default inspection visits of UK plants
default and completing relevant paperwork required by the Russian authorities in
defaultcluding lengthy questionnaires. 
defaultThis enabled trade to commence in ruminant meat after the 
defaultban 
defaultwas lifted in December 2012
default.
default 
defaultFurther technical negotiation
defaults at Secretary of State and Chief  Veterinary Officer level in September this year extended the deal to offal, a priority for industry. I
defaultndustry sources estimate that beef and lamb exports to Russia over the next three years could be worth up to £100 milli
defaulton, making it a very lucrative market for UK industry. Negotiations are now being progressed for export of live sheep.
