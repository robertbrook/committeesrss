defaultWritten evidence submitted by St Mungo’sdefaultSt Mungo’s has been opening doors for homeless people since 1969. We currently run over 100 projects, providing accommodation for more than 1,700 people every night and helping thousands more who are rough sleeping or at risk of homelessness. St Mungo’s delivers a range of residential services from emergency shelters to semi-independent flats, as well as non-residential health, education and employment services. We also prevent homelessness through our housing advice programmes. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSt Mungo’s services are based on a recovery approach and we aim to work in partnership with clients in a personalised, effective way. Our clients often have complex problems that cause, or are caused by, homelessness; we deliver holistic support to help people rebuild their lives.

default&#xa0; 
defaultThe transfer of responsibility for the much of the social fund to local authorities has seen varying provision put in place. Local authorities have refused assistance to people who are moving out of their area - defaultThis means people

default&#xa0; 
defaultin April 2011 t
defaulthe Government introduced caps on the maximum amount of LHA, 
defaultthe
default type of housing benefit that people living in private rented accommodation
default claim
default.
default 
defaultSince these caps were introduced
default,
default official
default statistics
default show a dramatic rise in the number of people who have become homeless after losing private rented accommodation
default.
default 
defaultThere has been a 78 per cent increase
default in
default the number of people becoming homeless due to the end of an assured shorthold tenancy
default, the most common type of private tenancy,
default when the first quarter of 2013 is compared to the first quarter of 2011.
default 
default2.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultCaps to LHA are likely to be partly responsible for t
defaulthis increase. 
defaultFew l
defaultandlords are lowering rents 
defaultas the amount of housing benefit that their tenants can claim is capped. 
defaultDepartment for Work and Pensions research shows that 37 per cent of private landlords 
defaultin London 
defaulthave taken action to evict tenants or no
defaultt renew tenancies when there is a shortfall between LHA and rent
default, 
defaultwhile 
defaultjust 
default6 
defaultper 
defaultwould consider 
defaultlower
defaulting
default rent
default for a current tenant
default.
default 
defaultDWP research also
default 
defaultthat landlords and housing advisors believe that the changes to LHA are behind increases in homelessnes
defaults.
default2.4.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn
default August
default 2012 Hackney Citizens Advice 
defaultfound that just nine per cent of rental properties on the market
default in Hackney
default were within LHA limits for self contained accommodation. Ninety per cent of
default 
defaultproperties within these limits were owned by landlords un
defaultwill
defaulting to
default 
defaultaccept LHA claimants
default. Therefore 
defaultonly one per cent of rental properties 
defaultin Hackney were available to LHA claimants.
default&#xa0;
default2.5.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe annual cap of a
default one 
defaultper cent
default increase to the LHA cap that will take effect from April 2014 will 
defaultfurther reduce
default the number of 
defaultren
defaulttal properties available in London with LHA levels
default,
default as rents look certain to rise
default by more than 
defaultone
default per cent
default a year.
default 
defaultThe Government could mitigate this widening affordability gap through targeting LHA affordability funding at areas in London. 
default2.6.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIf people can
defaultnot 
defaultfind affordable rented
default accommodation then there is usually no other type of accomm
defaultodation that they can rent or buy
default. 
defaultS
defaultome people m
defaultay cho

default areas
default with cheaper housing available. O
defaultthers may try to remain within living distance of their work, 
defaultfamily, friends or services that the
defaulty
default rely on such as schools
default and medical care
default. These people 
defaultmay sofa surf or squat, or end up rough sleeping and/or presenting themselves as homeless to their local authority.
default 
default&#xa0;default3.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn St Mungo’s experience an ever greater proportion of the accommodation which is available within LHA rates is 
defaultin 
defaultpoor
default condition. 
defaultT
defaultenants 
defaultoften move into these properties
default as they feel they have no 
defaultchoice
default but do 
defaultso,
default hoping that repairs and maintenance work
default will be completed by the landlord. Living in a poor quality property
default can often
default impact 
defaulton tenant’s health and
default lead
defaults
default to an increased risk of homelessness.
default&#xa0;default4.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe introduction of the LHA caps has made it more difficult for St Mungo’s clients to move out of our projects and into private 
defaultrented housing, especially in London. In the last two years there has been a steep decline in the number of our clients who have move
defaultd
default on from our projects into social housing. Over the same period the number of clients moving into private rented housing h
defaultas ceased to grow.
default4.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe are concerned that this will mean an increasing number of our clients will be stuck in supported accommodation 
defaultdespite being
default ready to live 
defaultindependently
default. This is likely to cause our hostels to ‘silt up’, meaning we cannot 
defaultprovide beds
default 
defaultpeople who are sleeping rough.
default&#xa0;
default5.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAs landlords raise rent to levels not met by LHA, m
defaultore peo
defaultple who have been homeless 
defaultbut have since moved into private rented housing 
defaultwill have
default to move at the end of a tenancy
default.
default 
defaultWhen homeless they may have been assisted to move into private housing by a local au
defaultthority or 
defaultother service through contribution
default towards
default 
defaultthe deposit and 
defaultrent 
defaultadvance
default. However, this assistance is 
defaultusually non transferable, meaning that at the end of 
defaultthe
default initial 
defaulttenancy the 
defaultperson
default has no financial assistance 
defaultto secure a new home. 
defaultThis leads to an increased risk of repeat homelessness
default.
default&#xa0;default6.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThere is considerable uncertainty around the immediate and long term effects of welfare reform on the funding of supported accommodation. 
defaultThe 
defaultGovernment consulted on the future of housing benefit and supported accommodation in 2011, but has yet to produce 
defaulta response to the submissions it received. 
default6.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn the meantime 
defaultthe 
defaultGovernment has committed to retain current arrangements for meeting the housing costs of benefit claimants living in supported ‘exempt’ accommodation, i.e. housing benefit will be administered
default by local authorities
default and paid directly to the landlord.
default 
defaultHowever, the legal definition of ‘exempt’ accommodation does not cov
defaulter all supported accommodation. It is likely that 
defaultt
defaulthere are high support projects homelessness project
defaults
default which may not meet the defi
defaultnition.
default6.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultPeople staying in supported accommodation that falls outside the definition (non exempt supported accommodation) will have support for their housing costs limited by the overall benefit cap. 
defaultTh
defaultis will make it difficult to meet the cost of running p
defaultrojects designed for people with very high housing needs.
default 
default 
defaultI
defaultt is
default also
default unclear how people
default in these projects
default will be able to claim any support whatsoever
default through Universal Credit
default for housing costs for stays in non exempt 
defaultsupported 
defaultaccommodation lasting less 
defaultthan a month.
default6.4.
default&#xa0; 
defaultSt Mungo’s understand that this is a complex policy area which
default the
default 
defaultG
defaultovernment are working with partners
default to resolve. A timely resolution 
defaultis vital to enable 
defaultproviders of supported accommodation
default 
defaultto be able to plan for the future
default. Failure to reso
defaultlve these issues could 
defaultreduce the
default amount of accommodation available for people who are homeless as homelessness increases. 
default&#xa0;default7.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultSt Mungo’s are implementing a strategy to boost the financial and budgeting skill
defaults of our clients. However, uncertainty over DWP’s plans around alternative payments and local support services mean it is extremely challenging to plan how the support we provide can be coordinated with Universal Credit.

default&#xa0; 
defaultThere is a particular need for clarity over arrangements and support for claimants transitioning from supported to independent acc

default,
default to living 
defaultin

defaultThis is

default defaultThe scheme operated by the DWP did not require a budgeting loan application to be applied for before a Commun

defaultpt this measure
default, unless it is an attempt to deflect costs that they should meet onto the DWP.
default&#xa0;default9.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultSt 
defaultMungo’s works across a number of local authority areas, we have seen significant variation in the way in which local schemes to replace council tax benefit
default operate. 
defaultWe have observed that p
defaulteople on low incomes 
defaultin 
defaultsome of the poorer areas in which we operate
default,
default have been asked to make the highest contribution to council tax. This can 
defaultmeans that people are now expected to pay a significant proportion of their income on council tax.
default9.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultSt Mungo’s runs Peer Advice Link, a resettlement and tenancy support programme st
defaultaffed by volunteers. One of our volunteers now has to pay £13 a month in council tax. His income consists of £56.80 a week Jobseekers Allowance.
default He therefore has to spend over five per cent of his income on council tax.
