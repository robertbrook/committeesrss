[normal]Written evidence submitted by St Mungo’s[bold]St Mungo’s has been opening doors for homeless people since 1969. We currently run over 100 projects, providing accommodation for more than 1,700 people every night and helping thousands more who are rough sleeping or at risk of homelessness. St Mungo’s delivers a range of residential services from emergency shelters to semi-independent flats, as well as non-residential health, education and employment services. We also prevent homelessness through our housing advice programmes. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]St Mungo’s services are based on a recovery approach and we aim to work in partnership with clients in a personalised, effective way. Our clients often have complex problems that cause, or are caused by, homelessness; we deliver holistic support to help people rebuild their lives.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.1.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]L[bold]ocal housing allowance (LHA) caps combined [bold]with high demand for rental properties are likely to be making people homeless -[bold] There has been a 78 per cent increase the number of people becoming homeless due to the end of an assured shorthold tenancy, 
[normal]which is 
[normal]the most common type of private tenancy, 
[normal]when the first quarter of 2013 is compared to the first quarter of 2011.
[normal]1.2.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Housing that is available with LHA rates is decreasing in quality[bold] and[bold] increasing the risk of homelessness[bold] - [bold]Living in a poor quality property
[normal] can often impact on tenants
[normal]’
[normal] health 
[normal]and
[normal] l
[normal]eads
[normal] to an increased risk of homelessness.
[normal]1.3.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]There is less housing available for people who are homeless in London to move into[bold]. This[bold] [bold]could [bold]result[bold] in[bold] insufficient beds being [bold]available for people who are sleeping rough[bold] [bold]- [bold]W
[normal]e are concerned that 
[normal]the shortage of available housing 
[normal]will 
[normal]result in 
[normal]a
[normal]n
[normal] 
[normal]increasing
[normal] number of our clients be
[normal]ing
[normal] stuck in supported accommodation
[normal],
[normal] despite being ready to live independently. This 
[normal]could
[normal] cause o
[normal]u
[normal]r hostels to ‘silt up’, meaning we cannot provide beds people who are
[normal] sleeping rough.
[normal]1.4.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]LHA caps mean that more people who have been homeless and have settled into private rented accommodation will have to move again, but without any financial assistance - [bold]This 
[normal]leads to
[normal] an increased risk of repeat homelessness 
[normal]1.5.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Unresolved wel[bold]fare reform issues[bold], particularly those relating to [bold]supported ‘exempt’ accommodation,[bold] 
[normal]are threatening to disrupt the provision of supported accommodation for people who are homeless[bold] - [bold]Failure to resolve these issues could 
[normal]lead to
[normal] a
[normal] further reduction 
[normal]in 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]amount of accommodation available for people who are homeless. 
[normal]1.6.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Universal Credit direct payments: more detail is needed in plans for alternative payment arrangements and local support services - [bold]I
[normal]t is vital that 
[normal]local support
[normal] 
[normal]services are effective
[normal] and tha
[normal]t suitable alternative pay
[normal]ment
[normal] arrangements are in place
[normal] 
[normal]i
[normal]n order to prevent Univers
[normal]al Credit causing homelessness.
[normal] 
[normal]There is a particular need for 
[normal]more clarity 
[normal]over 
[normal]arrangements and support for claimants transitioning from supported accommodation to 
[normal]independent accommodation.
[normal]1.7.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The transfer of responsibility for the much of the social fund to local authorities has seen varying provision put in place. Local authorities have refused assistance to people who are moving out of their area - [bold]This means people
[normal] are 
[normal]treated as 
[normal]not 
[normal]resident anywhere for 
[normal]local support fund purposes and so cannot access any funds
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.8.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Requirements to apply for a budgeting loan before a local support fund will be considered have been put in place in some areas - [bold]This is resulting in
[normal] peo
[normal]ple who have been 
[normal]homeless people starting a
[normal] new tenancy saddled with debt, increasing the risk of repeat homelessness. It is unclear why some local authorities have decided to adopt this measure, unless it is an attempt to deflect costs that they should m
[normal]eet onto the DWP.
[normal]1.9.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The replacement of council tax benefit with localised schemes has led to significant extra costs for people on low incomes, particularly in poorer areas[bold].[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.1.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]LHA caps combin[bold]ed [bold]with high demand for rental properties [bold]are[bold] likely to be[bold] mak[bold]ing [bold]people homeless[bold], especially in London. [bold]2.2.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]in April 2011 t
[normal]he Government introduced caps on the maximum amount of LHA, 
[normal]the
[normal] type of housing benefit that people living in private rented accommodation
[normal] claim
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Since these caps were introduced
[normal],
[normal] official
[normal] statistics
[normal] show a dramatic rise in the number of people who have become homeless after losing private rented accommodation
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]There has been a 78 per cent increase
[normal] in
[normal] the number of people becoming homeless due to the end of an assured shorthold tenancy
[normal], the most common type of private tenancy,
[normal] when the first quarter of 2013 is compared to the first quarter of 2011.
[normal] 
[normal]2.3.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Caps to LHA are likely to be partly responsible for t
[normal]his increase. 
[normal]Few l
[normal]andlords are lowering rents 
[normal]as the amount of housing benefit that their tenants can claim is capped. 
[normal]Department for Work and Pensions research shows that 37 per cent of private landlords 
[normal]in London 
[normal]have taken action to evict tenants or no
[normal]t renew tenancies when there is a shortfall between LHA and rent
[normal], 
[normal]while 
[normal]just 
[normal]6 
[normal]per 
[normal]would consider 
[normal]lower
[normal]ing
[normal] rent
[normal] for a current tenant
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]DWP research also
[normal] 
[normal]that landlords and housing advisors believe that the changes to LHA are behind increases in homelessnes
[normal]s.
[normal]2.4.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]In
[normal] August
[normal] 2012 Hackney Citizens Advice 
[normal]found that just nine per cent of rental properties on the market
[normal] in Hackney
[normal] were within LHA limits for self contained accommodation. Ninety per cent of
[normal] 
[normal]properties within these limits were owned by landlords un
[normal]will
[normal]ing to
[normal] 
[normal]accept LHA claimants
[normal]. Therefore 
[normal]only one per cent of rental properties 
[normal]in Hackney were available to LHA claimants.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The annual cap of a
[normal] one 
[normal]per cent
[normal] increase to the LHA cap that will take effect from April 2014 will 
[normal]further reduce
[normal] the number of 
[normal]ren
[normal]tal properties available in London with LHA levels
[normal],
[normal] as rents look certain to rise
[normal] by more than 
[normal]one
[normal] per cent
[normal] a year.
[normal] 
[normal]The Government could mitigate this widening affordability gap through targeting LHA affordability funding at areas in London. 
[normal]2.6.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]If people can
[normal]not 
[normal]find affordable rented
[normal] accommodation then there is usually no other type of accomm
[normal]odation that they can rent or buy
[normal]. 
[normal]S
[normal]ome people m
[normal]ay cho
[normal]o
[normal]se to move
[normal] areas
[normal] with cheaper housing available. O
[normal]thers may try to remain within living distance of their work, 
[normal]family, friends or services that the
[normal]y
[normal] rely on such as schools
[normal] and medical care
[normal]. These people 
[normal]may sofa surf or squat, or end up rough sleeping and/or presenting themselves as homeless to their local authority.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.1.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]In St Mungo’s experience an ever greater proportion of the accommodation which is available within LHA rates is 
[normal]in 
[normal]poor
[normal] condition. 
[normal]T
[normal]enants 
[normal]often move into these properties
[normal] as they feel they have no 
[normal]choice
[normal] but do 
[normal]so,
[normal] hoping that repairs and maintenance work
[normal] will be completed by the landlord. Living in a poor quality property
[normal] can often
[normal] impact 
[normal]on tenant’s health and
[normal] lead
[normal]s
[normal] to an increased risk of homelessness.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.1.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The introduction of the LHA caps has made it more difficult for St Mungo’s clients to move out of our projects and into private 
[normal]rented housing, especially in London. In the last two years there has been a steep decline in the number of our clients who have move
[normal]d
[normal] on from our projects into social housing. Over the same period the number of clients moving into private rented housing h
[normal]as ceased to grow.
[normal]4.2.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]We are concerned that this will mean an increasing number of our clients will be stuck in supported accommodation 
[normal]despite being
[normal] ready to live 
[normal]independently
[normal]. This is likely to cause our hostels to ‘silt up’, meaning we cannot 
[normal]provide beds
[normal] 
[normal]people who are sleeping rough.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]As landlords raise rent to levels not met by LHA, m
[normal]ore peo
[normal]ple who have been homeless 
[normal]but have since moved into private rented housing 
[normal]will have
[normal] to move at the end of a tenancy
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]When homeless they may have been assisted to move into private housing by a local au
[normal]thority or 
[normal]other service through contribution
[normal] towards
[normal] 
[normal]the deposit and 
[normal]rent 
[normal]advance
[normal]. However, this assistance is 
[normal]usually non transferable, meaning that at the end of 
[normal]the
[normal] initial 
[normal]tenancy the 
[normal]person
[normal] has no financial assistance 
[normal]to secure a new home. 
[normal]This leads to an increased risk of repeat homelessness
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]6.1.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]There is considerable uncertainty around the immediate and long term effects of welfare reform on the funding of supported accommodation. 
[normal]The 
[normal]Government consulted on the future of housing benefit and supported accommodation in 2011, but has yet to produce 
[normal]a response to the submissions it received. 
[normal]6.2.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]In the meantime 
[normal]the 
[normal]Government has committed to retain current arrangements for meeting the housing costs of benefit claimants living in supported ‘exempt’ accommodation, i.e. housing benefit will be administered
[normal] by local authorities
[normal] and paid directly to the landlord.
[normal] 
[normal]However, the legal definition of ‘exempt’ accommodation does not cov
[normal]er all supported accommodation. It is likely that 
[normal]t
[normal]here are high support projects homelessness project
[normal]s
[normal] which may not meet the defi
[normal]nition.
[normal]6.3.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]People staying in supported accommodation that falls outside the definition (non exempt supported accommodation) will have support for their housing costs limited by the overall benefit cap. 
[normal]Th
[normal]is will make it difficult to meet the cost of running p
[normal]rojects designed for people with very high housing needs.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]t is
[normal] also
[normal] unclear how people
[normal] in these projects
[normal] will be able to claim any support whatsoever
[normal] through Universal Credit
[normal] for housing costs for stays in non exempt 
[normal]supported 
[normal]accommodation lasting less 
[normal]than a month.
[normal]6.4.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]St Mungo’s understand that this is a complex policy area which
[normal] the
[normal] 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment are working with partners
[normal] to resolve. A timely resolution 
[normal]is vital to enable 
[normal]providers of supported accommodation
[normal] 
[normal]to be able to plan for the future
[normal]. Failure to reso
[normal]lve these issues could 
[normal]reduce the
[normal] amount of accommodation available for people who are homeless as homelessness increases. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]7.1.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]St Mungo’s are implementing a strategy to boost the financial and budgeting skill
[normal]s of our clients. However, uncertainty over DWP’s plans around alternative payments and local support services mean it is extremely challenging to plan how the support we provide can be coordinated with Universal Credit.
[normal]7.2.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he
[normal] Universal Credit 
[normal]l
[normal]ocal 
[normal]s
[normal]upport 
[normal]s
[normal]ervices 
[normal]f
[normal]ramework and 
[normal]al
[normal]ternative payments arrangements guidance
[normal] 
[normal]set out the 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment’s approach to deciding 
[normal]which claimants
[normal] should be 
[normal]exempt 
[normal]from direct monthly payments and how budgeting support for claimants is to be provided. The current documents 
[normal]set out an over
[normal]all approach but are lacking in detail
[normal]7.3.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The DWP’s direct payment pilots showed significant increases in rent arrears when dir
[normal]ect payments were introduced.
[normal] 
[normal]D
[normal]irect payments have the potential to lead to
[normal] increased levels of homelessness, substa
[normal]nce use and financial exploitation if the correct alternative payments and budgeting support are not in place.
[normal] Alternative payment arrangement
[normal]s
[normal] and budgeting support must be targeted at the correct claimants and effectively administered.
[normal] In this context r
[normal]eports 
[normal]around 
[normal]problems in administering the 
[normal]so far 
[normal]extremely limited roll out 
[normal]of 
[normal]Universal Credit
[normal] are cause for deep concern.
[normal]7.4.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]There is a particular need for clarity over arrangements and support for claimants transitioning from supported to independent acc
[normal]ommodation. There is a risk that claimants could move from living in supported accommodation where there housing costs are paid directly to their landlord
[normal],
[normal] to living 
[normal]in
[normal] independent accommodation with no support available
[normal],
[normal] and receiving all of their Univers
[normal]al Credit award in one monthly payment.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]8.1.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Local authorities have refused assistance to people [bold]who are moving out[bold]side[bold] of [bold]their [bold]boundaries. [bold]This means people are treated as not resident anywhere for local sup[bold]port fund purposes and so cannot access any funds[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]8.2.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]People in this 
[normal]situatio
[normal]n
[normal] may 
[normal]not be able to ask for help from the 
[normal]local authority that
[normal] they are
[normal] moving into
[normal]. Th
[normal]ey
[normal] are likely to
[normal] need assistance before mov
[normal]ing
[normal] and s
[normal]ome 
[normal]local authorities
[normal] require a minimum residence period before applications will be considered. 
[normal]Good practice standards should be adopted across London – or preferably nationwide – so that no
[normal] 
[normal]one finds that they are effectively not treated as resident anywhere for 
[normal]loc
[normal]al suppo
[normal]rt fund
[normal] purposes and so cannot access any funds.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.3.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Requirements to[bold] apply for a budgeting loan before a local support fund will be considered[bold] have been put in place in some areas [bold]8.4.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]This is 
[normal]result
[normal]ing 
[normal]in homeless people starting a new tenancy saddled with debt,
[normal] undermining their chances of sustaining the tenancy
[normal].
[normal] [bold]The scheme operated by the DWP did not require a budgeting loan application to be applied for before a Commun
[normal]ity Care Grant would be awarded. It is unclear why some local authorities have decided to ado
[normal]pt this measure
[normal], unless it is an attempt to deflect costs that they should meet onto the DWP.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]9.1.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]St 
[normal]Mungo’s works across a number of local authority areas, we have seen significant variation in the way in which local schemes to replace council tax benefit
[normal] operate. 
[normal]We have observed that p
[normal]eople on low incomes 
[normal]in 
[normal]some of the poorer areas in which we operate
[normal],
[normal] have been asked to make the highest contribution to council tax. This can 
[normal]means that people are now expected to pay a significant proportion of their income on council tax.
[normal]9.2.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]St Mungo’s runs Peer Advice Link, a resettlement and tenancy support programme st
[normal]affed by volunteers. One of our volunteers now has to pay £13 a month in council tax. His income consists of £56.80 a week Jobseekers Allowance.
[normal] He therefore has to spend over five per cent of his income on council tax.
