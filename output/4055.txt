[[[Submission from Roy Bailey]]]&#xa0;I am an electrician with 30 years experience having City and Guilds / electrical engineering certificates and now unregistered subcontractor since building control has put part P in. When I saw the video my thoughts were clear, why we have so many complicated schemes. There must be another way for the public as in my eyes if a scheme is simple/easy then there would be more compliance.&#xa0;Building Control only needs to go a bit further, to directly check the competency of each electrician (insurance ,qualifications etc ) that need /want to comply with part P. Then you wouldn’t need lots or indeed any of the current private company schemes for part P.  Building Control would take over part P compliance, to public domestic electrical work .It would give a fairer playing ground for big and small contractors with respect to costs.&#xa0;I also think electrical certificates, even standardised ones, as the Institution of Engineering and Technology forms,.would be recognised better by the public if issued via Building Control but still submitted from the electrician.   Then the Public are more likely to get the correct one! I know of a contractor who didn’t issue a electrical certificate because of the current Building Control notification, the client only got a BC one.  There only needs one certificate the correct one.&#xa0;4 December 2013&#xa0;
