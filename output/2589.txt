[[[nderachievement in education by white working class children]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;This submission draws on published findings from the Annual Report of Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector 2011/12, Unseen Children: access and achievement – 20 years on (June 2013), White boys from low-income backgrounds: good practice in schools (2008) and a recent paper that Ofsted commissioned looking at the educational attainment of White British students from low income backgrounds. It also draws on Ofsted’s forthcoming good practice report No Child Left Unseen: successful practice in raising the attainment and progress of pupils from low income families, as well as internal analyses of outcomes data and inspection reports.&#xa0;Much of the data analysis in this submission is based on academic outcomes for those pupils that were eligible for free school meals, known as ‘FSM’, up to and including 2012. In this submission, these pupils are referred to as ‘disadvantaged’ or from low income backgrounds.&#xa0;Ofsted’s section 5 school inspection framework was strengthened further in September 2012 to ensure that the achievement of specific groups of pupils, especially those pupils in receipt of support through the pupil premium, is at the very heart of an inspector’s judgements. It is now harder for schools to be judged good or outstanding where the achievement of disadvantaged pupils is below that of other pupils. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[ducational outcomes for white working class pupils ]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Deprivation is based on the Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index (IDACI) 2010. The deprivation of a provider is based on the mean of the deprivation indices associated with the home post codes of the pupils attending the school rather than the location of the school itself. The schools are divided into five equal groups (quintiles) that are labelled from ‘most deprived’ to ‘least deprived’. ‘Unseen children: access and achievement in education 20 years on’ http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/accessandachievement https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-of-vocational-education-the-wolf-report
