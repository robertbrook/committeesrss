[[[Summary]]]As a science-based conservation organisation working across the world, WWF greatly values the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) periodic assessment reports, the latest of which (AR5) saw its first instalment - the “Physical Science Basis” (WG1) - published on 27 September, 2013. There is no other similar science-based international process on any issue of global relevance than that undertaken by the IPCC, which is both supported and mandated by the nations within the UN. The main activity of the IPCC is to provide, at six-year intervals, assessment reports detailing the state of scientific knowledge on climate change. These extremely detailed, peer-reviewed reports, particularly the Summary for Policy Makers (SPM), are vital tools in helping to inform the wider world about the body of scientific knowledge that underpins our current understanding of how anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are changing the planet’s climate, how this is likely to impact managed and natural ecosystems and human communities, and what the options are for adaptation and mitigation responses, both now and in the decades ahead. The latest instalment published in September – with its increased expressions of certainty - only serves to reinforce the scientific foundation upon which WWF is calling for the urgent decarbonisation of the global economy.

[[[An Introduction to WWF]]]WWF is the largest environmental network in the world, with projects in over 100 countries.  One of our key aims is tackling climate change, and, as a result, we have been active in UK and global energy policy discussions for more than a decade. We are strongly committed as an organisation to helping prevent the worst impacts of climate change and, in particular, preventing temperatures from rising above 2ºC compared to pre-industrial levels. WWF is an official “observer organisation” to the IPCC. Based on their scientific background, knowledge and experience, some WWF staff have also been nominated and endorsed by governments as either contributing authors or reviewers. This process followed rigorous vetting by the IPCC secretariat, as is the case with all authors and reviewers from any institution, including business and industry. However, in the case of the AR5 WG1, WWF was not involved as an author or an officially registered reviewer.

[[[clusions?]]]Overall, since its Nobel Prize-winning assessment report in 2007, the IPCC has strengthened its position as the world’s most authoritative, rigorous reference source for the science of climate change and, therefore, remains the best available guide for policymakers. WWF sees no reason to question the report’s conclusions. In addition, WWF is always open to new scientific evidence.

[[[ What areas need further effort to reduce the levels of uncertainty?]]]There are areas of climate science that merit further research. For instance, the IPCC is cautious when assessing the negative feedback mechanism to the climate caused by the off-gassing of methane or carbon dioxide from the sea floor or permafrost soils as a result of continued warming under scenarios other than RCP8.5 (the IPCC’s worst-case scenario). Also, further advances on the methodology, data collection and analysis of future climate “extremes” would help to improve the IPCC’s expressions of “low confidence” for “Increases of intensity and/or duration of droughts” and “increases in intense tropical cyclone activity” for the early 21st century. Such expressions of “low confidence” were not based on a plethora of contradictory data, but on the lack of data or representative sophisticated models. These are just some examples where further research would be beneficial, but none provide a justification for a lack of action on reducing GHG emissions.

[[[5 sufficiently explained the reasons behind the widely reported hiatus in the global surface temperature record?]]]However, the cut-off for incorporating papers into AR5 WG1 – the deadline was 31 July 2012 – meant that the very latest scientific inquiry into this topic was not considered. For example, the Met Office, one of the world’s most respected climate science research centres, published in July 2013 a report examining the “potential causes”. It concluded that heat absorption by the world’s oceans was likely to be an important factor: “Observations of ocean heat content and of sea level rise suggest that the additional heat from the continued rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations has been absorbed in the ocean and has not been manifest as a rise in surface temperature. Changes in the exchange of heat between the upper and deep ocean appear to have caused at least part of the pause in surface warming and observations suggest that the Pacific Ocean may play a key role.”The Met Office added in an accompanying report that the “recent pause…does not materially alter the risks of substantial warming of the Earth by the end of this century. Nor does it invalidate the fundamental physics of global warming, the scientific basis of climate models and their estimates of climate sensitivity”.The IPCC also put short-term natural variations in surface temperatures in the context of long-term anthropogenic GHG atmospheric forcings by stating that up to 40% of “emitted CO2 will remain in the atmosphere longer than 1,000 years.”

[[[te in light of the findings of the IPCC AR5 Physical Science Basis report? ]]]In part two of the review, published in December 2013, the CCC concluded that in light of the latest climate change projections presented by the IPCC “in order to limit risks of dangerous climate change and preserve close to a 50% chance of keeping temperature rise below 2°C, it is necessary that global emissions peak around 2020, with deep cuts through the 2020s and in the following decades. The currently legislated budget is a minimum UK contribution to this global emissions pathway.”WWF-UK’s view, in unison with a broad coalition of businesses, investors and civil society representatives, is that the carbon budget targets set by the Climate Change Act represent the absolute minimum in terms of emissions reduction commitments for the UK in light of the scientific evidence presented in the IPCC’s latest report.
