[[[DCLG Electrical Competent Person Scheme]]]I have watched the video from the HOC Communities and Local Government Committee meeting held on the 2nd September 2013 and subsequently submit my response to this below.1. As I am broadly in agreement with what other contributors have so far submitted, I will refrain from repeating many of the points already raised. However, I would like to provide my views on the standards of training and changes to the registration system.2. To briefly outline my knowledge of the industry, I am an electrician with 40 years of experience and have worked in both commercial and domestic environments and was a Part P accredited contractor when it was first introduced. I am a full member of the IET (institution of Engineering and Technology) and a registered electrician at technician grade with the JIB.3. During the last 7 years I have mainly worked as a freelance trainer for both private training providers and FE Colleges. This work has involved delivery of courses for industry recognised qualifications relating to the IET wiring regulations (BS7671) and Inspection and Testing. In addition, I am a qualified NVQ assessor and verifier and have helped many apprentices achieve the Level 3 NVQ that is recognised within the industry as the minimum standard of competency.4. As has been pointed-out by other contributors, one of the negative aspects of Part P, which was initially welcomed by the trade as a way to improve standards, has been the way it’s been hijacked by private training providers offering very short courses (at very high prices) for anyone to become a domestic electrician.  And whilst domestic electrical systems are the least technically challenging, they still require a high level of competency to be installed correctly and these skills certainly can’t be learnt in just a few weeks. Moreover, to make matters worse, these short courses have been encouraged by the various Part P scheme operators because they provide a good source for new members and an easy way to boost revenues. 5. Unfortunately, this is a classic case of a good idea having unintended consequences and the sad fact is that overall standards of domestic electrical installation work have not improved at all and in many instances are actually worse.  As mentioned above, I have worked for a private training company who provided these courses and witnessed first-hand the folly of this policy.  &#xa0;6. In my opinion, and contrary to the wishes of the current accreditation bodies, the way forward is to move away from the profit based registration schemes and adopt a single system of accreditation - which the public can easily understand and similar to the gas industry model (Gas Safe) - whereby ANY individual working in the electrical industry must be suitably competent and assessed on a regular basis.  It should also require all electricians to be suitably qualified to the standards recognised by the JIB ECS scheme, which, in addition to requiring the relevant technical certificates, requires proof of suitable experience.7. I greatly welcome the DCLG committee’s investigation into this matter and strongly hope your conclusions are to recommend a root-and-branch overhaul of the current accreditation system as currently it benefits nobody except the scheme operators themselves. However, if this is not possible then at the very least, for the sake of clarity, a single register of all certified installers should be adopted (or enforced by government) similar to that proposed by NAPIT.8. Finally, I was slightly dismayed that the committee did not challenge Emma Clancy’s claim that her organisation represents eighty percent of contractors who carry-out ninety percent of all electrical work. This may be true for the electrical contracting industry as a whole but the DCLG committee is only considering the domestic market and I would be surprised if this percentage claim was so high in this segment of the industry?I trust you will find my above contribution of interest and if you think I can be of further assistance please don’t hesitate to contact me.24 November 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
