"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n              \nWritten evidence submitted by The College of Social Work &#xa0;\nThe College of Social Work (TCSW) \nis the centre of excellence for social work and provides resources to its members to uphold and \nstrengthen standards of professional practice\n. \nIt holds the professional standards for social work, supports the professional development of social workers, and campaigns on issues relating to social work policy and practice.  An independent membership org\nanisation, The College provides quality assurance for initial and post-qualifying education through its training and education endorsement scheme.\n&#xa0;\nLike colleges for other professions, our role is to:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFrequency, scope and impact of consultations&#xa0;TCSW notes that a number of recent Ofsted consultations have been published with a very limited time period in which to respond. We would ask that, if possible\n, this does not occur in the future in order that we can all continue to work together constructively.  As an organisation with a duty and responsibility to consult our membership, Professional Assembly and Children and Families Faculty, it does pose diffi\nculties for TCSW when short timescales are offered for consultations.  \n&#xa0;\nOfsted and its decision making and impact&#xa0;\nAs has been acknowledged by the ADCS, the LGA and Ofsted itself, the judgments reached including, in particular, the grading can have significant consequences for a local \nauthority and\n seriously impact upon morale and, indeed, imperil the very improvements\n required.  There are concerns among a range of stakeholders particularly in a climate of austerity about the role being played by Ofsted in contributing to unhelpful pressures upon local authorities seeking to deliver excellent services. TCSW would sugges\nt  that some form of independent advisory group composed of key stakeholders, including members of the TCSW, should work with Ofsted to explore how quality is defined and to\n  support  the development of risk management\n (as recommended by the Munro Review) \ncultures and learning organisations. \n&#xa0;TCSW believes that the voice of social work should be at the core of the inspection and a mechanism in place which would help with the analysis of work place culture, allowing management to identify early on any press\nure points that are impacting\n on\n good practice. TCSW would argue that the Principal Children and Family Social Worker (PSW), a key recommendation of the Munro Review, offers a means of linking frontline issues to strategic management. We have established a\n PSW network in conjunction with the Department for Education\n. H\nowever\n,\n we are concerned that the rate of adoption greatly contrasts among different local authorities. We would like to see incorporated within the inspection framework an indication of wheth\ner an authority has a \nPSW in place. TCSW will do the utmost to ensure that these PSW’s are supported and linked to other PSWs across England.\n&#xa0;\nPractice Improvement Role&#xa0;\nTCSW notes the proposed addition of the practice improvement role to the Ofsted remit\n and have welcomed our involvement in early discussions. G\niven that this greatly strengthens\n the position of Ofsted with respect to the definition of a quality social work service to children and families, we consider it even more essential that an indepen\ndent advisory group (as referred to above)\n \nis involved in discussions about the parameters of the role and in a consult\native capacity with respect to \nthe judgements mad\ne about how to improve quality.\n TCSW has been working with one local authority to develo\np an action plan to support the professional development and supervision of social workers by mapping training needs to the Professional Capabilities Framework. While still in its early stages, TCSW expects to expand this role further in the future \nfor\n aut\nhorities where Ofsted have made recommendations for improvements.\n&#xa0;\nEmployee standards&#xa0;The pressure of high caseload volumes is very often cited by social workers as a form\nidable barrier to good practice, although\n defining what constitutes a ‘hig\nh’ number \nis difficult\n. A single case could involve intensive work over a period of many months, while another might feasibly be ‘closed’ within a matter of days. As such, TCSW would like to see a focus on how social work\n cases and tasks \nare allocated, supervised, a\nnd evaluated. The Standards for Employers and Supervision Framewor\nk developed by the Social Work T\nask Force must take on greater significance within the inspection framework to ensure that social workers have manageable workloads and receive appropriate su\npervision. \n&#xa0;\nMulti-agency inspections&#xa0;\nOfsted has announced that multi-agency inspections will begin from April 2015. These inspections were due to begin this year but were postponed due to operational issues. While it is crucial that these issues are iron\ned out, TCSW notes that Scotland has been conducting multi-agency inspections for a number of years\n already. Given the frequency with which\n significant coordination issues\n are highlighted\n in Serious Case Reviews, TCSW would urge that these inspections are \nnot delayed any further. The evaluation of the Daniel Pelka and Keanu Williams cases contained similarities with regards to multi-agency coordination and information sharing. We would therefore like to better establish what constitutes ‘good’ practice in t\nerms of regular and effective monitoring and evaluation of multi-agency practice. \nMonitoring\n the effectiveness of inter-agency and in\nter-professional collaborative \npractice should be examined \nat all levels of case management and all levels of service deliv\nery, from early help to adoption or reunification from care. \n&#xa0;\nWhile there is an implicit expectation for social care and early help services to interact, we believe that that the relevant indicator, without being overly-prescriptive, should go further in \ndefining what this might practically entail. TCSW consider\ns\n that name\nd social workers should play a \nconsultative role as members of early help teams around families and a key case management role for all teams around families in which a child\n is assessed as ‘in need’ of \nadditional family support, child protection\n,\n or \na \nlooked after child or transition to adulthood service. \n&#xa0;The voice of children and families &#xa0;It is extremely important that those who use services are at the heart of the inspe\nction process. How is the child’s journey placed at the heart of the \nprocess?\n This is mentioned in the descriptors but \nmore detail\n is required in relation to \nthe process\n. Moreover, we consider it vital that that engagement is wit\nh families in the widest se\nnse.\n Children’s own perspectives on who they consider family and who matters to them has been recognised in Family Group Conferences and in evaluations of intensive outreach and child protection services as offering productive possibilities for safety plan\nning and decision making. These evaluations could provide a strong methodology for the inspection process and we would encourage collaboration with researchers when testing the dimensions to be used in deciding on the approaches to improving services to be\n recommended by Ofsted.  \n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n"
