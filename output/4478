[normal]Written evidence from
[normal] [bold]Xpede
[normal] Medical Ltd
[normal] (CMI0024)
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]I am writing to you as the owner of a small fledgling medical legal company.  My business has 
[normal]just at the end of November 2013 completed its 3
[normal]rd
[normal] financial year.
[normal] Since September 2012 I started to employ 1 person on a part time basis and this is a working mum who, I am pleased to say, has given up claiming tax credit due to the earnings she is making
[normal] by working for Xpede Medical Ltd. I am very happy and proud of this fact and it pleases me immensely as I know all the parties in the political arena would class this as a small success story.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, m
[normal]y main reason for writing to you is to air my conce
[normal]rns about the intended implementation 
[normal]of Independent Experts panel. At the moment the indications are that there could possibly be a tender process requesting interested medical legal agencies to bid for the tender.
[normal]This proc
[normal]ess would 
[normal]mean small startup co
[normal]mpanies such as mine will have to spend tens of thousands of pounds just to prepare to run for the tender process and definitely small companies like mine will close down
[normal] leaving only the big companies
[normal], including the ones owned by PI solicitor firms
[normal],
[normal] to ru
[normal]n for tender.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The second option I have heard which is being considered, is that both agencies and medical experts 
[normal]may 
[normal]have to be accredited in order to carry out medical legal
[normal] work
[normal].
[normal]Whilst I completely agree that experts
[normal]’
[normal] should 
[normal]receive comprehensive trai
[normal]ning and 
[normal]accredit
[normal]ation 
[normal]in order to provide more quality reports I am again wary of the costs which will be involved for small business
[normal]es 
[normal] to obtain accreditation if this is to be the chosen method.  
[normal]Will the costs to small medical agencies be considered? 
[normal]Will there be any exceptions for small medical agencies cost wise etc?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]My understanding is that the whole purpose of this exercise is to reduce whiplash injuries and this will be achieved by obtaining more independent reports. But if the larger companies,
[normal] especially the ones owned by PI solicitors or their friends/families are able to jump through all these hoops as cost will not be a consideration for them, then all that this exercise will do is put smaller bona fide medical legal agencies out of business
[normal] and yet the very people who 
[normal]you are aiming to 
[normal]monitored will be free to carry on as normal.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]My suggestion would be 
[normal]to adopt some of the following practices
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I hope my concerns 
[normal]will be 
[normal]taken on board and 
[normal]also hope that my suggestions are of some help to you in your decision making process.
[normal]I am more than happy to speak to anyone
[normal] in order to discuss the above points further. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I look forward to receiving 
[normal]details of the next steps.
