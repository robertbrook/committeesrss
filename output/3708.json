"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nLinda Farley\n (CYS0007)\nToday I had two very encouraging encounters with \nlorries\n a couple of minutes apart.  These incidents illustrate that well equipped lorries with well trained and considerate drivers can make a real difference to cycle safety.\n&#xa0;\n1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI was holding back on the \ninside of a lorry in a stream of traffic on the Archway Road.  The driver saw me, and I saw him, in his nearside mirror.  He waved to indicate that he had seen me and that I could proceed to pass him on the inside, which I did.  In this case the mirrors we\nre larger and better positioned than most on commercial vehicles.\n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAt the bottom of Archway I was waiting to join the traffic going round the roundabout.  The driver of a Waitrose lorry saw me, paused his vehicle which created space for me to join the traff\nic on the roundabout and waved to me to show he was waiting for me.  I joined the traffic on the roundabout easily and safely.\nKey to both incidents was the driver’s \npositive \nawareness of me as a cyclist and their readiness to communicate with me. \nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
