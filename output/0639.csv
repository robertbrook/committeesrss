defaultThe National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS) is one of the Natural Environment Research Council's (NERC) 6 research centres. The mission of NCAS is to pursue internationally leading research in atmospheric science and to provide national capability and leadership to the UK atmospheric science community. NCAS performs research to increase knowledge of key environmental issues including climate variability and change, weather, and atmospheric composition. NCAS is a distributed organisation in which the research activities are embedded in UK Universities.  The Universities with the largest involvement in delivering NCAS research are (in alphabetical order): Cambridge, Leeds, Manchester, Reading and York.

defaultThe climate directorate of NCAS (NCAS-Climate) provides a core programme of fundamental science, technical support and training to enable world-class scientific research into the global climate system. NCAS-Climate has particular strengths in analysis, understanding and numerical simulation of the processes that govern climate variability and change. NCAS-Climate is based primarily at the Universities of Reading and Cambridge, with additional staff at the Universities of Edinburgh, Leeds &amp; Oxford.

defaultOur responses are restricted to those questions where NCAS has relevant expertise and experience. However, we would like to make the additional observation that a key aspect of improving public understanding about climate change is appreciating, understanding and addressing the many different reasons 
defaultwhy
default members of the public are sceptical. It is highly likely that different responses will be appropriate to address these different reasons. We would therefore encourage the Committee to include this important issue in the scope of their inquiry. The need to clarify what members of the public are actually sceptical about should also be taken into account, as answers to surveys are often highly sensitive to the specific question asked.
defaultWhich voices are trusted in public discourse on climate science and policy? What role should Government Departments, scientific advisers to Government and publicly funded scientists have in communicating climate science?
default2.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPublicly funded scientists have a responsibility to communicate scientific knowledge and the results of research accurately, stressing what is known with confidence, whilst acknowledging where there is uncertainty and incomplete understanding.  This responsibility is particularly important in an area such as climate science where there is obvious policy relevance and strong public interest.  
default2.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is not the role of publicly funded climate scientists to advocate any specific policy responses, but it is part of our role to explain the likely or potential consequences of alternative policy choices, based on current scientific understanding.
default One of the most common reasons heard for scepticism is that climate science is incorrectly perceived to be - or is misleadingly presented as being - policy prescriptive.  In this situation, those arguing for or against a particular policy sometimes seek to criticise or misrepresent the science rather than debate the policy choice.  It can be very difficult for members of the public to distinguish legitimate and well informed scientific debate from “false debate” that is generated to advance specific political agendas
default.
default2.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe experience of NCAS-Climate is that the public value the opportunity to engage directly with the scientists doing the research, and that this engagement improves trust. This type of direct communication activity takes time, and is generally not accorded high value in academic reward systems. However, NCAS has actively encouraged the involvement of its scientists in public engagement activities and many NCAS staff members participate in a range of public events.
default2.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe internet also has an important role to play in providing the public with information about climate science. NCAS climate is in the process of developing web pages designed to communicate climate science in ways that are accessible to a broad audience. An important aspect of these pages is the aim to 
defaultplace new research results in context
default (which is often hard for the public to do) by explaining the broader questions that drive our research.
default2.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAnother web-based initiative with which we have experimented in recent years is the “Climate Lab book”.
default This blog is an experiment in ‘open source’ climate science. It is written by climate scientists, for climate scientists, but open to anyone to see and comment on.   One aim is to increase the transparency of climate science, so that interested members of the public can see the scientific process in action. We have also found that Twitter can play a useful role in this context.
defaultHow could public understanding of what is meant by climate change be improved? What are the main barriers to this? Does the media have a positive role to play?
default2.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe media clearly has a very important role to play, and there is much good reporting of climate science.  However, it still appears acceptable to write articles or present reports which are not scientifically accurate, and/or to selectively and misleadingly present scientific results in order to advance a particular agenda (which may be political or commercial, and may exaggerate or understate climate related risks). Easier recourse for scientists to achieve prominent corrections of such scientific inaccuracies would be helpful. Bodies such as the Science Media Centre have produced very helpful journalistic guidelines for scientific stories.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultActivities such as those outlined under 2.4-2.6 could potentially be scaled up. 2.4 - direct engagement between climate scientists and members of the public - is probably one of the more effective mechanisms, but also one of the more costly.  Were they available, greater resources could be devoted to this work.
default2.9
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultClimate science is actually a very old science – the existence of a ‘greenhouse effect’ was first suggested in the 1820s and experimentally measured in the 1860s, for example. Emphasising that this basic physical understanding predates any more modern environmental concerns has been found to be useful in communicating the science. Discussing what is known about non-anthropogenic climate change and variability (e.g. glacial cycles, El Nino, the jet stream) and the differences in time-scale (e.g. 100 years or 10,000 years) is also an effective way of engaging the general public, rather than focusing exclusively on anthropogenic climate change
default.
default2.10
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is a major need for all parties (scientists, media, politicians) to more clearly and consistently distinguish apolitical climate science from highly political climate policy.
default2.11
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe teaching of climate change in schools is clearly an important issue for public understanding, especially in the medium and long term (with specific relevance to the next point, 2.12). Whilst NCAS has no specific expertise on the National Curriculum, we note with concern recent proposals which appear to reduce and narrow the attention given to climate science in the National Curriculum for under 14s.
defaultHow important is public understanding in developing effective climate change policy?
default2.12
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn a democracy it is hopefully self evident that government policies can only be sustained if the public has an adequate understanding of the reasons why the policies are appropriate. In the climate area, this requires some public understanding of climate science (especially because climate evolves on a timescale that is long compared to a government term of office) as well as - crucially - public trust in the science and scientists involved.
