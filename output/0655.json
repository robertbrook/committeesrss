"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by John Gahan (CLC035) &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1) A public understanding of what is meant by climate change amounts to what is aired by the broadcast media and what is written in newspapers. Our temperate climate tends to fool the public at large, especially the young, since they have no historical concept of how temperate climates work, and that climates are ever changing. The impression is that public opinion has altered dramatically in recent years towards a more sceptical society. This is probably due to wide variability experienced in a typical U.K. climate, sometimes too hot and dry, sometimes too cold and wet with changeable seasonal precipitation. While public opinion has changed, public service broadcasting (The BBC) has not, and continues with a rather biased AGW agenda. &#xa0;Analysis &amp; CommentaryThe question is does \nman-made \n(\nindustrial\n)\n \ncarbon dioxide \ntogether with natural inputs bring about\n \nglobal warming or \nclimate change\n?\n This \nis \nunderstood \nto be the case \nby \nmany \np\noliticians\n \n(\nsome\n)\n \nc\nlimate\n s\ncientists\n and seemingly the public at large. Discharge to the atmosphere of CO\n2\n \ngases due \nto the ‘burning’ of fossil fuels\n,\n \nthereby said to exert global warming, \nis known as \nAnthropogenic Global Warming (\nor \nAGW)\n in science circles - or do \nenvironmental changes occur because of other factor\ns currently being investigated\n?\n&#xa0;\nFirstly\n,\n c\nontentious claims \nthat\n CO\n2\n \nis the major\n cause for \nglobal \nclimate \nchange\n, \nis\n based on \nhistorical \nlaboratory\n \nexperiments (a closed system\n)\n \ncarried out in\n the mid-1800s\n.\n \nT\noday \nthis assertion is \nhotly disputed \nby \na very\n large body\n \nof \nscientists commonly\n referred to as \nclimate \nsceptics\n. The conclusion arrived \nat is \nthat AGW\n is a false \nhypothesis \nderived from\n years\n \nof\n \ngeophysical understanding of \nthe \nscientific \nmodus operandi\n, and \nscholarly interactions\n with \nleading\n scientists\n in the field of climate physics. This \nalso \nstems from observational evidence\n \nthat CO2 \nis \na \nminor \nheat radiating\n trace gas\n \ncommon to the \natmosphere\n, \nyet \ncurtailed by \na \nrelatively \nshort \nresidency time\ns (\ntwo to five\n years\n). Hence it\n is highly\n \nunlikely to affect global temperatures in the manner proposed\n. Additionally\n CO\n2\n \ncomprises\n \na \nnegligible \nquantity \nof \nthe \nmolecular \nmass in\n our atmosphere, and\n currently amounts\n to \n0.0396.8 \npart\ns\n per million\n by volume \n(\nppmv\n -\n \nCO\n2\n.Org Feb 2013\n)\n. B\nut\n \nit \nis \nstill \nalleged \nto \nconstitute the\n prime \nso-called ‘greenhouse g\nas\n’\n (GHG)\n thereby engendering\n \na \nso-called \nglobal ‘greenhouse e\nffect\n’\n (GE)\n,\n \nsaid \nunequivocally \nto be \nresponsible for climate change\n \nregardless of its source\n (industrial/natural)\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nWith \nthe quality of carbon dioxides \nforcing effect on climate warming (subscribed to by the AGW orthodoxy)\n,\n it is \nneither challenged, nor\n made clear\n, that atmospheric g\nases, especially CO\n2\n is calibrated\n using a logarithmic scale.\n This gas\n does not absorb infra-red radiation over a linear range as many \nclimate \nscientists mistakenly believe. \nBecause CO\n2\n is\n \nstrongly logarithmic in \nmagnitude \n(a measurement that displays the value of a ph\nysical quantity using intervals\n \ncorresponding\n \nto orders of scale\n), the first 1.5\no\nC of molecular CO\n2\n arises from the initial 20ppm. The next 1.5\no\nC increase requires\n \na further 400ppm, and then 1\no\nC for a further 1000ppm. The significance of this is that \nwith current levels put at \n~\n0.039\n%\n,\n \na\n one \n100ppm increase will amount to ~0.1\no\nC warming after 50 years and less so with each added 100ppm increment. Or put\n \nanother way,\n \nassuming a rising rate of 2ppm per annum (IPCC), temperatures will rise at 0.1\no\nC for every 50 years\n.\n&#xa0;\nFurthermore CO\n2\n forcing can only be radiated over a tiny portion of the infra-red (IR) spec\ntrum, i.e. \nwithin a\n \n15\n \nmicron bandwidth\n only\n. Gaseous H\n2\nO \n(water vapour) \non the other hand (~4% of all atmospheric gases) is measured similarly but over\n \nalmost the entire bandwidth\n spectrum\n.\n \nTherefore it is\n unscientific\n, nay impossible that anthropogenic and natural carbon dioxide gases coalesced together (or separately) can b\ne responsible for climate warming\n. \nNot only is this gas insufficient of itself to account for a projected high degree of additional \ntemperature escalation \n(2.4 to 6.4\no\nC) by the end of the twenty first century (AR4 2007, IPCC).\n \nBut even with the inclusion of more dominant GHGs \n(H\n2\nO, CH\n4\n) \nthat contribute mainly to the mass of our\n atmosph\nere, \nsuch\n large\n increases in \nwarming are \nseen to be unattainable. Given\n the best climate scientists\n, they\n can\nnot\n predict \nfuture warming trends\n with any accuracy\n \nor\n \nindeed \nthe\n amount of carbon dioxide \nthat is said to contribute to it.\n It is well understood\n that atmospheric CO\n2\n follows \n(is \nnot \nresponsible for) \nwarming over historical\n time-frames, \nbut\n \nacts \nin reverse \n–\n \natmospheric \ncarbon d\nioxide \nfollow\ns warming,\n \nalbeit \nsomewhat belatedly over-time. (\nh\nundreds\n of years). This\n trend points to \ngradual rise\ns\n \nin \ntemperature following the last Ice Age ~10k years ago\n and suggests we might be entering one of many interglacials \nduring\n the current Ice Age.\n Interestingly researchers at Berkeley National Laboratory \n(Jan 2012) \nhave \nfound that \nnewly discovered so-called Cr\niegee biradicals molecules react to \naccelerate the formation of sulphate and nitrate in the atmosphere. \nIt is suggested t\nhese compounds will lead to aerosol formation and ultimately to cloud formation with the potential to cool the planet\n rather than warm it\n.\n&#xa0;\nHowever, t\nhe\n \nhottest \nclimate ‘science’ innovation \nused by climate science institutions, \nis \ndefined (guessed at) using specious modelling techniques \n(\nbuilt-in projected \nundefined \nfeedbacks)\n. T\nhe end \nresults\n \nof which provide\n nourishment \nfor political consumption in IPCC reports\n. It can be said \nthat hitherto temperature ratios have not increased beyond 0.\n7\no\nC from ~\n150\n years\n ago\n. This is\n \nas one would expect\n given \nwell \nresearched \nobservational data\n, although \nvested interests \nwill state otherwise – mention \n‘\nclimate change\n’ for funding research grants \nand yo\nu are more than likely to get them\n!\n&#xa0;\n2) Official pronouncements should always be trusted in public discourse by Government departments (‘the voices’) and must balance AGW rhetoric (from strident pressure groups and pseudoscience institutions) with balanced and clear directives. Moreover they should act only on thorough scientific evidence, and not be duped by consensus or none evidential viewpoints.&#xa0;Commentary&#xa0;T\nendentious pseudoscience \nhas been\n \nlaid bare \nby\n the so-called ‘Hockey Stick’ diagram \nthat first appeared in\n \nscience \nliterature \nand\n the\n public \nmedia in \n2008\n -\n \n‘\nThe Hockey Stick Illusion\n’\n (\n2010\n) and additional \nliterature\n opposing AGW issues\n. \nThis was followed \na year later \nby the\n \n‘Climategate affair’ \nthat \nexposed \nthe same \ninstitutions and so-called ‘climate scientists’\n \ntransgressing\n \ntheir responsibilities to \nscience ethics. T\nhe climategate \nrevelation\ns\n \nwere\n a \nseminal moment\n that\n \nreinforced \ndeep scepticism\n \nof \nscience \neverywhere\n. I\nt became \npatently \nclear that \nnot only were\n \nsome\n \nscience institutions\n \nseen to be apostate to science principles, \nbut that the \n‘\nscience\n’\n conducted was\n \ncorrupt to its\n core\n.\n Worse \nwas \nto follow \nwhen\n a committee tribunal\n \nexonerated the protagoni\nsts \nwith\n \na \n‘\npseudo-judicial\n’ ruling\n (\nby a chairman\n \nwith AGW leanings\n)\n \nwithout due \nreference to the \nmendacious \nbehaviour\n employed\n by the protagonists\n themselves\n \nin\n \naltering and obliterating\n their ‘research’ \nand presenting it \nas \nauthentic \nscience. \nMoreover, \nour public broadcaster \nthe BBC\n,\n contrived \nby all means possible\n’\n to silence any \nopposition to these AGW ‘researchers’\n and \nthe \nshabby science\n that followed from it.\n \nI\nn \nfact \nthe BBC went out of its way to \ncommend \nthis\n \n‘\ndodgy data\n’\n based \non \nthe\n \ncontrived \nHockey Stick \nillustration\n and without probing comment expected from a public broadcaster\n. This was backed-up\n \nwith a documentary series \n(\nEarth: The \nClimate Wars, \n2010\n)\n,\n \nwhile \nelsewhere \ntheir medium \npersisted with (an unbalance\nd\n) AGW \nagenda\n \nat every opportunity\n. Indeed \nit could be \nsaid;\n \nthe \nBBC legitimised \nthe Hockey Stick\n author (Prof Michael Mann) \nwith \nprime-time \n(celebrity ‘scientists’) in \nradio \nand TV \nappearances\n \nthat went essentially \nunchallen\nge\nd in contravention of its \neditorial\n standards\n -\n \nto this effect\n \nunderpinned by Royal Charter\n.\n Not only is the U.K. a democracy underpinned \nby\n \nfundamental right\ns for detracting \nopinion\ns, but \nthe BBC \nfunded by licence fee payers\n has no \nmandate\n \nto adopt partisan strategies\n \nas to what\n,\n \nin \ntheir opinion\n, \nis \ncorrect and \ngood for us.\n  \n&#xa0;\n3) A public understanding of climate change and how reporting it could be improved, should call to account public funded broadcasters (the BBC) and related media outlets, with recognition that sceptical and opposing viewpoints, to say the AGW consensus, cannot be suppressed. All controversial issues must be articulated and debated together with balanced programming in easily understood lay terms – much the same way that the BBC is very good at, but alas has been venerating and extolling an AGW agenda for more than a decade now.&#xa0;Commentary&#xa0;From time-to-time there has been a good deal of\n \ncorrespondence with the BBC and BBC Trust, principally as a long term licence fee payer\n/s, to remind the power-that-be, \nthat in al\nmost every broadcast \n(regardless)\n \nvia radio or television on\n their pervasiveness to plug \nthe\n \nAGW \nagenda\n \nwithout balancing the topic with opposing viewpoints\n. Th\neir response has been\n in the\n \nstandard form:\n&#xa0;\n‘\nThe BBC has held a high-level seminar with\n&#xa0;\nsome of \nthe best scientific experts&#xa0;\nand has come to the view that the weight of evidence no longer justifies equal space being given to the opponents of the AGW consensus’\n&#xa0;\nOr to be concise ‘The science is\n settled\n’\n -\n tough! \nWell needless to say\n,\n as a practitio\nn\ner\n \n(now retired) \ni\nn geophysics\n, \n(the) \nscience is never se\nttled. Hence \nmuch\n laboured\n correspondence\n took place\n \nwith the \nC\norporation and \nTrust \nas to who these ‘best scientific experts’ might be. Disquieting \nto report both organisations\n refused to name the scientists\n \ninvolved \ndespite\n insistence that \nit was \ntheir duty \nto do so under the\n terms of their \nbroadcasting mandate and \nfor \nreasons of \npublic\n tr\nansparency\n.

For example parliamentary climate change minister/s should be eager to understand the nuances of how science works and be readily disposed to listen to opposing/sceptical arguments whether for or against related issues. Rather than, as at present, adopting out-of-hand AGW policies (unwittingly?) that are hurting household energy bills for the want of a clearly defined energy policy in the interests of the electorate, and not to satisfy noble cause politics.&#xa0;\nCommentary&#xa0;When in post i\nt was \nclearly \napparent \nthat Chris Huhn\ne\n (Coalition\n,\n LD\n) was a vocal \nAGW \nenvironmentalist, \nas was\n David\n Milliband (Labour\n) before him\n,\n \na\nnother\n strident AGW supporter\n.

Moreover \nn\none \nhas\n \never \nbeen employed\n outside \nof \nacademia\n or \nwork\ned\n \nin the \n‘\nreal world\n’\n.\n \nT\nhe current \nEnvironment Secretary\n is\n seemingly\n enacting a \ncoalition \ninitiative\n \nclearly \ndesigned with \nenergy\n polic\nies \nthat could\n be \nrightly \ncalled \nthe\n \n‘\nGreen M\nix’- a\n \nstrategy \nclearly \nintent on\n \nutilising \na combination\n of \nrenewable\n energy\n resources\n,\n such as\n wind turbine\n, solar panel\n and tidal \nsurge\n. Such\n ‘green’\n policies thus far have\n cost/is costing m\nillions of pounds of \ntax payer funding\n by way\n of \nG\novernment subsidies\n, \nno doubt\n designed to appease the \nmino\nrity (yet \nstrident) \ngreen lobby. \nHowever it is well know\nn\n that m\nanufacturing costs \nof wind turbines \nare \nextremely \nhigh while the U.K’s \nchaotic\n variable\n wind speeds \nmake their use\n largely inefficient\n \nand costly to maintain\n or replace\n. T\nhe evi\ndence/research points to a huge\n i\nmbalance\n of ope\nrating margins that is \nleading to \nrising energy prices\n from \nan \nunworkable \nmisguided\n \nenvironment \npolicy\n. \nAs for solar power in our \nchangeable climate where \nwinters are \nlong, cold, dark and damp \nand \nwhen \npower is most needed, \nthey \nare \nagain \nsingularly \ncostly and \ninefficient\n \nbecause \ninsolation is highly variable\n. \nAnd l\nike most renewable \nenergy \nsources the\n electricity generated is\n unable to be stored\n thereby \nde\nlimiting \ndownload\ns \nto \nthe National Grid\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nO\nn the \ninevitable concern \nof\n \nutilising \nnuclear power\n,\n well\n \nthis is \none of th\ne most \nproven \nand \nreliable \nsources of energy\n,\n \nalbeit \nassociated with \ninitial \nhigh build\n, maintenance\n \nand safety \ncost\ns\n. The conundrum still exists however;\n ‘what is to be done\n with nuclear waste?’ As for\n \nsafety issues\n generally\n, well the industry as a whole tends to be \n(\nextremely\n)\n safety conscious \nfollowing Chernobyl (1986)\n \nand \nFu\nku\ns\nhima (2011)\n -\n a\n natural\n \nunforeseen catastrophe\n. \nSad to report a\n \nU.K. \nnuclear p\nower programme\n \nby necessity should\n \nhave\n been addressed \n(\nby succ\nessive Governme\nnts\n) many\n years ago with a \nre\nbuild/modification \nprogramme\n projected\n fifty\n \nto\n perhaps \na hundred years ahead\n -\n but today is \nstill in\n \nwanting because of restricting\n \n \nAGW\n laws\n/\nguidelines\n \nthat result \nin \ncontinued \nin\naction\n.\n&#xa0;\n5) As alluded to elsewhere, the Government appears not to seek or acquire sufficient expertise in climate science, yet continues to follow a green agenda leading to injudicious policies. When it deigned to invite a sceptical climate expert last year (Prof Richard Lindzen - lecture House of Commons, Feb 2012), no parliamentary follow-up ensued. The forward-thinking blogosphere and some media outlets were enthusiastic and hopeful of a radical turnabout on current policy, but this authority on climate change science was again (House of Lords, Jan 2005) neglected or ignored.&#xa0;Commentary&#xa0;A wealt\nh of insight and knowledge on \nclimate science has been ignored by \npoliticians, the media, \nand \nespecially \nAGW \nscientists following their own (CO\n2\n) agenda. V\nast amounts of \nnew \nresearch by Earth scientists, astrophysicists, cosmologists, climatologists and other disciplines is today available from easily accessed websites and institutions. Much information is still being researched but what is available has been made accessible on the internet which attempts to address all known (and unknown) variables \nrelating to climate science. In\n \njust a few \nexample\ns\n, a well informed paper of climate modelling/residency times and AGW CO\n2\n on the origins and proficiency \nof GE global warming is available from \nProfessor \nSegalstad (1997) together with impartial independent studies, such as website \nhttp://brneurosci.org/co2.html\n \n(click Global warming) \nwhich is highly informative. Such balanced studies from many Earth and climate physicists foretell of variable factors (too many to discuss here) that poin\nt to warming and cooling episodes\n over shorter time spans than was previously envisaged in addition to episodically longer periods of warming/cooling deduced from the geological record. \n&#xa0;\nFurther studies (\nreadily accessible) include the influence of Heinrich Events (sedimentary marine core data), D-O Cycles (ice core data), and Milankovic Cycles (Solar system planetary cycles). Solar insolation alone amounts to 99% of warming and radiativ\ne forcing at the Earth’s interface where \nwarming phase transition\ns release\n CO\n2\n \nfrom natural sinks \nto the\n \natmosphere in relatively short-term (hundreds \nof years) following temperature increases\n. \nSimple experiments demonstrate that solar irradiance cycles \nand industrial\n \ncarbon \n(fossil\n fuels) \ncontribute min\niscule amounts of \nlife-giving \nCO\n2\n \nto the atmosphere. I\nnsolation is the driving mechan\nism of all \natmospheric heating \ncaptured \n(to a greater extent)\n by\n a\n \n‘\nBlanket Effect’\n rather t\nhan (a \nmisnomer\n) ‘The\n Greenhouse Effect\n’.  Furthermore t\nhe atmosphere is an open system and does not have a ceiling\n, where all atmospheric heat is ultimately lost \n(disseminated) \nto the vacuum \nof \nspace\n.\n \nAnd h\naving researched the impact of \natmospheric \nCO\n2 \ngases\n \nfor many years, there is no\n \nscientific \nevidence \nwhatsoever \nthat carbon dioxide is \nuniquely responsible\n \nfor\n inducing \nglob\nal warming (\nclimate change\n) – regardless that \nthere \ni\ns\n \na\n \ncorrelation \nof\n \nnominal warming\n \n(\nthermal infra-red\n) \nin\n all \nGHGs (H\n2\nO, CH\n4\n, \nC\nO2\n) and a dilution in\n \nothers \n(N, O, &amp; O\n3)\n.\n A c\norrelation \nwith something else however \ncannot be regarded as science\n \nfact as many \nmight \nbelieve.\n&#xa0;\nIndeed the \nCLOUD project\n currently under investigation\n at CERN relating to heavy electron bomba\nrdment (muons) due to idiosyncratic variation in\n solar flares \n(\ncoronal mass ejections\n)\n seems to offer a better understanding of \n(\nperhaps\n)\n \nshort\ner\n term \nclimate change\n based on solar irradiance\n. Current\n \n(\nknown\n)\n \nclimate \ninfluences\n fail\n to persuade many scientists (the sceptics) that CO\n2\n (a minor thermally reactive gas) is the prime \ndriver of\n global warming (\nclimate change\n)\n.\n&#xa0;6) Yes lessons can be learnt by public engagement with climate policy, especially from other countries. Examples have been provided in this testimony to the closed mindset of many politicians, some scientists, and parts of the media and public alike. Countries such as India and China reject outright any global treaties on limiting atmospheric carbon dioxide emissions (Bonn &amp; Copenhagen Climate Change Conferences), while other countries such as Canada, Russia and Japan pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol (1997) in 2011, because their economies are thought likely to stagnate under, what could be said, iniquitous and unrealistic carbon targets that science tells us can never be implemented.&#xa0;Commentary&#xa0;India and China emphasise an\n overriding priority of maintaining high economic growth \nrates to raise living standards. Their plans \nident\nify measures that promote \ndevelopment objectives while also yielding co-benefits for address\ning climate change effectively if possible.\n&#xa0;\n Both agree \nnational measures would be more successful with assistance from developed coun\ntries, and pledge\n that \nper c\napita greenhouse gas emissions \nwill at no point exceed tha\nt of developed countries even if \npursue\nd with development objectives.\n In other words their\n own economies\n must come first,\n \nwith a tacit understanding that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels cannot be controlled\n by the \ndeveloped world, and anyway \nthe \nAGW \nscience is \nsuspect and \nnot proven.\n&#xa0;\nI\nn 2011 \nJapan and Russia stated that they would not take on further Kyoto targets.\n&#xa0;\nThe Canadian government invoked Canada's legal right to formally withdra\nw from the Kyoto Protocol in \nDecember 2011.\n&#xa0;\nCanada was committed to cutting its greenhouse gas emissions to 6% below 1990 levels by 2012, but in 2009 emissions were 17% higher than in 1990\n, \nwhile warming remained static\n. The Environment minister\n&#xa0;\ncited Canada's liability to \"enormous financial penalties\" under the \nKyoto \ntreaty unless it withdrew.\n&#xa0;\nHe also suggested that the recently signed\n&#xa0;\nDurban agreement\n&#xa0;\nmay provide an alternative way forward.\n \nCanada's decision was strongly c\nriticised by \nother ratifying countries\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nN.B.On a topical \nbut \nsad \nnote following the \ndea\nth of our former Prime Minister,\n \nBaroness \nLady Thatcher\n (‘The P\nolitician\n’\n)\n, she\n \nwas greatly \nresponsible \nduring the 1980s for adopting an\n \nAGW agenda.
