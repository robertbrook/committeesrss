default1. Introduction default&#xa0;
default1.
default              
defaultTwo of my colleagues on the Commission on a Bill of Rights for the United Kingdom, Jonathan Fisher QC and Anthony Speaight QC, have submitted evidence to the Committee.  I agree with the legal analysis set out in their papers as to the history of Article 3 of the First Protocol and its (mis)interpretation by the Strasbourg Court.
default&#xa0;
default2.
default              
defaultThe Committee and Parliament as a whole face a very serious issue of conflict between the law on prisoner voting as passed by Parliament, and the judgments of an international court to which the United Kingdom has made itself subject by treaty.  This conflict has arisen despite the scrupulous care which was taken by the government of the day to negotiate wording in Article 3 which would not call into question the right of the United Kingdom to maintain the exceptions from the right to vote which existed under its own law, or similar exclusions which existed under the laws of other European States.
default&#xa0;
default3.
default              
defaultThis is a conflict which should never have arisen, if the international court set up under the Convention had sought to interpret and apply the Convention and its Protocols in accordance with their meaning as intended by the signatory states who drafted and agreed them.  However, the Strasbourg Court has adopted a radically different approach to “interpretation” of the Convention, so-called “dynamic” or “living instrument” interpretation, under which it has asserted the power to created new legal rights which are neither reflected in the actual wording of the Convention nor were intended to be created by the States parties when it was drafted.  The prisoner voting issue is a particularly striking and clear-cut example of a much more widespread problem with the Court’s jurisprudence.

defaultAmending UK law in order to resolve the conflict created by the 
defaultHirst
default and 
defaultScoppola
default judgments of the Strasbourg Court is not a straightforward task, short of abandoning altogether any form of restriction on voting by prisoners.  At present, the disqualification of convicted prisoners from voting is a coherent and workable system.  Whilst it is true that prisoners are sent to prison for offences which vary greatly in nature and seriousness, these factors are reflected in the sentence imposed.  The voting disqualification lasts for the length of the sentence, and so in that respect the period of voting disqualification is proportionate to the offence.
default&#xa0;
default5.
default              
defaultThe draft Bill’s alternative options for a voting ban which would apply to prisoners sentenced to terms of at least 6 months or 4 years are put forward in apparent deference to the Strasbourg Court’s view that a ban is incompatible with Article 3 if it “affects a group of people generally, automatically and indiscriminately, based solely on the fact that they are serving a prison sentence, irrespective of the length of the sentence and irrespective of the nature or gravity of their offence and their individual circumstances”.
default  However, each of the alternative cut-offs in the draft Bill could be 
defaultcriticised for creating arbitrary distinctions between people just above and just below the cut-off,
default and as not having regard to the specific nature of the individual offence or other individual circumstances.
default&#xa0;
default6.
default              
defaultFor these reasons I agree with Anthony Speaight’s evidence that it is far from certain that the adoption of either of these alternatives would succeed in resolving the conflict with the Court’s jurisprudence.
default  The present law is both coherent and democratically and constitutionally legitimate.  It would be beyond unfortunate if Parliament were to be pressured to replace it with a law which lacks its democratic support,  coherence or logic in order to seek to satisfy the judgments of the Strasbourg Court, only then to find the replacement law found in breach of Article 3.
default&#xa0;
default7.
default              
defaultThe root of the present problem does not arise from the law adopted by Parliament but from things which have clearly gone wrong on the international plane.  The Committee should therefore consider whether the problem can and should be addressed at that level rather than by amending the law of the United Kingdom.
default&#xa0;
default2. Possible withdrawal from the First Protocol default&#xa0;
default8.
default              
defaultThe First Protocol is one of the so
default&#x2011;
defaultcalled "optional" protocols to the Convention. These optional protocols
default set out substantive rights which are additional to those contained in the body of the Convention itself.  Only States which are parties to the Convention are allowed to sign up to the optional protocols.
default&#xa0;
default9.
default              
defaultThe UK ratified the First Protocol on 3 November 1952. Currently, all States who are parties to the Convention have also ratified the First Protocol, with the exceptions of Switzerland and Monaco.  Switzerland signed the Protocol on 19 May 1976 but has never ratified it mainly because of difficulties over Article 2 on the right to education.  In consequence these countries are not bound by the First Protocol.
default&#xa0;
default10.
default              
defaultNone of the optional Protocols, in contrast to the Convention itself, contains an express provision relating to denunciation (withdrawal).  However,  each states that the Articles of the Protocol concerned have effect between the high contracting parties to the Protocol as if included in the Convention itself.  It appears to follow
default that each optional Protocol to which a State is party may be individually denounced by following the procedure for denunciation under Article 58 of the Convention, which is giving 6 
defaultmonth's notice to the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe.
default&#xa0;
default11.
default              
defaultWithdrawal from the First Protocol would eliminate the cause of the present conflict with the Strasbourg Court over prisoner voting and would allow the United Kingdom to maintain its present law unchanged.
default  Given that Switzerland has declined to ratify the Protocol in the 60 years since it was first agreed, it cannot plausibly be argued that the UK’s withdrawal from the Protocol would cause unacceptable legal or political problems within the Council of Europe.  Our withdrawal would act as a long overdue warning shot to the Strasbourg Court that States will not accept it continuing to exceed the proper bounds of the treaties and protocols which it is its duty to interpret.
default&#xa0;
default12.
default              
defaultIn addition to Article 3 which gives rise to the present and immediate difficulty, the First Protocol also contains Article 1 on the protection of property and Article 2 on the right to education. The UK would cease to be bound by these Articles as well, but that in my view should be regarded as a positive benefit rather than a drawback, particularly in the case of Article 1.
default&#xa0;
default13.
default              
defaultArticles 1 to 3 of Protocol 1 are mentioned in section 1(1)(b) of the HRA 1998 and are set out in Schedule 1,  as forming part of the "Convention rights" under the Act. If the UK were to withdraw from the Protocol on the international plane it would appear to follow that these would cease to be “Convention rights” for internal purposes but this is not totally certain.
default&#xa0;
default14.
default              
defaultThere would be a need to tidy up the Act.  One option would be a simple deletion of the references to these Articles from the Act and Schedule 1;  but a more interesting approach could be considered under which they would retain their status as "Convention rights" for internal purpose within the United Kingdom but would no longer be subject to section 2 of the Act which states that in interpreting them, a court "must take account of" Strasbourg case law.  Instead, it could be provided that in interpreting them, our domestic courts should interpret them (or if necessary, re-interpret them) from first principles according to the original intentions of the States who drafted them without regard to any Strasbourg case law.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default3. EU law and the Charter of Fundamental Rights default&#xa0;
default15.
default              
defaultBy virtue of the Treaty of Lisbon,
default the rights, freedoms and principles set out in the Charter of Fundamental rights have the same legal value as the Treaties.  It has been established that the so-called “opt-out Protocol” negotiated by the UK and Poland in 
defaultfact has no substantive effect in limiting the operation of the Charter.
default  The Charter contains articles which confer rights corresponding to those in the Convention, as well as many other articles which confer additional rights.
default&#xa0;
default16.
default              
defaultThe Charter has effect within the scope of EU law.  This means that it binds the institutions, and in addition it binds the Member States “when they are implementing Union law.”
default&#xa0;
default17.
default              
defaultArticles 39 and 40 of the Charter are as follows:-
default&#xa0;defaultArticle 39defaultRight to vote and to stand as a candidate at elections to the European Parliamentdefault 
default&#xa0;
default1. Every citizen of the Union has the right to vote and to stand as a candidate at elections to the European Parliament in the Member State in which he or she resides, under the same conditions as nationals of that State.
default&#xa0;
default2. Members of the European Parliament shall be elected by direct universal suffrage in a free and secret ballot.
default&#xa0;
defaultArticle 40defaultRight to vote and to stand as a candidate at municipal electionsdefault 
default&#xa0;
defaultEvery citizen of the Union has the right to vote and to stand as a candidate at municipal elections in the Member State in which he or she resides under the same conditions as nationals of that State.
default&#xa0;
default18.
default              
defaultIn two appeals recently heard by the Supreme Court,
default  it was argued on behalf of two life prisoners that these Articles of the Charter conferred a right to vote on the individuals concerned and that any restrictions on that right to vote should be construed under EU law in conformity with the Strasbourg Court’s judgments under Article 3 of the First Protocol to the Convention.  Hence, it was argued, the restrictions currently imposed by UK law on their right to vote are incompatible with EU law, at least in respect of local elections and elections to the European Parliament, and the relevant provisions of the UK statutes should be disapplied.
default&#xa0;
default19.
default              
defaultIn due course the Supreme Court will deliver its judgment in these cases and there is little point in me attempting to speculate in my evidence on the likely outcome.  However, it is almost certain that the Committee will wish to take account of that judgment in its deliberations, assuming that it becomes available in time.   One 
defaultpossible outcome is that the Supreme Court might consider it necessary to make a reference to the ECJ at Luxembourg seeking guidance on the relevant points of EU law.
default&#xa0;
default20.
default              
defaultA key point is whether or not these provisions of the Charter are to be interpreted by reference to Article 3 of the First Protocol to the Convention, and by extension by reference to the case law of the Strasbourg Court interpreting that Article.  It is to be noted that Article 52(3) of the Charter states:-
default&#xa0;
default“3. In so far as this Charter contains rights which correspond to rights guaranteed by the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the meaning and scope of those rights shall be the same as those laid down by the said Convention. This provision shall not prevent Union law providing more extensive protection.”
default&#xa0;
default21.
default              
defaultIn my view it is clear that there is no direct correspondence between Article 3 of the First Protocol and Articles 39 and 40 of the Charter because their scope of application is different.  Article 3 applies to national elections, whilst Articles 39 and 40 of the Charter do not apply to national elections at all, but apply respectively to European Parliament and municipal elections.  However, it is a more open question whether these Articles of the Charter should be interpreted by reference to Article 3 of the First Protocol by analogy.
default&#xa0;
default22.
default              
defaultThe Explanations
default attached to the Charter in general explicitly state the cross linkages between articles of the Charter and corresponding articles of the Convention: for example, the Explanations state that paragraph 1 of Article 2 of the Charter is based on the first sentence of Article 2(1) of the Convention on the right to life.  There are similar explicit references in all or almost all cases where the Charter provisions are based on provisions of the Convention.  It is notable in this context that the Explanations relating to Articles 39 and 40 of the Charter 
defaultdo not
default cross-refer to Article 3 of the First Protocol; instead, the refer to the relevant provisions of the EU treaties.
default&#xa0;
default23.
default              
defaultOn the other hand, Article 3 was mentioned by the ECJ in its judgment in Case C-300/04 
defaultEman and Sevinger v Den Haag
default, at paragraphs 48 and 54 of the judgment.  The case concerned a claim by residents of a Dutch overseas territory (Aruba) to vote in European Parliament elections, a claim which the Court in principle rejected.  It is worth quoting part of the judgment in full:
default&#xa0;
default“43 However, neither Article 190 EC nor the 1976 Act defines expressly and precisely who are to be entitled to the right to vote and to stand as a candidate in elections to the European Parliament.
default&#xa0;
default44 No clear conclusion can be drawn in that regard from Articles 189 EC and 190 EC, relating to the European Parliament, which state that it is to consist of representatives of the peoples of the Member States, since the term ‘peoples’, which is not defined, may have different 
defaultmeanings in the
defaultMember States and languages of the Union.
default&#xa0;
default45 It follows from those considerations that, in the current state of Community law, the definition of the persons entitled to vote and to stand for election falls within the competence of each Member State in compliance with Community law. It must, however, be ascertained whether that law precludes a situation such as that in the main proceedings, in which Netherlands nationals residing in Aruba do not have the right to vote and to stand as a candidate in elections to the European Parliament.
default&#xa0;
default46 First, it should be noted that the OCTs are subject to the special association arrangements set out in Part Four of the Treaty (Articles 182 EC to 188 EC) with the result that, failing express reference, the general provisions of the Treaty do not apply to them (see 
defaultLeplat
default, paragraph 10, and 
defaultNetherlands v Council
default, paragraph 49).
default&#xa0;
default47 It follows that Articles 189 EC and 190 EC do not apply to those countries and territories and that the Member States are not required to hold elections to the European Parliament there.
default&#xa0;
default48 
defaultArticle 3 of Protocol No 1 to the Convention does not preclude that interpretationdefault. 
default[emphasis added]  Since the provisions of the Treaty do not apply to the OCTs, the European Parliament cannot be regarded as their ‘legislature’ within the meaning of that provision. On the other hand, it is within the bodies created within the framework of the association between the Community and the OCTs that the population of those countries and territories can express itself, through the authorities which represent it.”
default&#xa0;
default24.
default              
defaultIt can be argued that paragraph 48 contains an implicit recognition by the ECJ that Article 3 is relevant to the interpretation of the right to vote in the European Parliament elections.  On the other hand, since that paragraph is simply dismissing the argument advanced by the voters on the basis of Article 3, it may be said that the ECJ in that case simply did not need to grapple with the question of whether Article 3 was relevant at all.
default&#xa0;
default25.
default              
defaultIn my view, the above considerations strongly reinforce the desirability of the UK withdrawing from the First Protocol, and doing so as soon as possible.  At present, all EU Member States are parties to the First Protocol which makes it comparatively easy for the ECJ to state that the obligations in Article 3 are assumed in common by all Member States, and hence those obligations (and their interpretation by the Strasbourg Court) may be used to interpret the obligations of Member States in relation to European Parliament elections.
default&#xa0;
default26.
default              
defaultIf however the UK withdraws from the Protocol, it becomes considerably harder for the ECJ to uphold such an argument.  It would put it in a position of, in effect, seeking to apply to the United Kingdom indirectly treaty obligations which the United Kingdom had validly disavowed in international law.

defaultThe others are Protocols 4, 6, 7, 12 and 13.
defaultThis is a question in the field of law of the formation and cessation of international treaties, in which I do not claim special
default 
defaultexpertise.  However, even if it were not possible for a State to withdraw from an individual optional Protocol to which it is a party by this means, the same result
default 
defaultcould clearly be achieved
default 
defaultby denouncing the Convention itself and all its Protocols under Article 58, and then re-joining the Convention but not the optional Protocol concerned.
defaultAt least in theory, the United Kingdom could still face being ordered to pay compensation to individual petitioners for the period until it ceases to be a party to the First Protocol but that would be a secondary problem.
defaultFor example, the Strasbourg Court’s jurisprudence extending the concept of “property” under Article 1 to include mere commercial expectations has been cogently criticised by Lord Scott of Foscote in his lecture “Property Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights”, 19 Nov 2009.
