&#xa0;
[normal]Letter from the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government dated 9 January 2014[bold] (PD11)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Inquiry into the Performance of the Department Follow Up[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]I apologise for being unable to attend the evidence session on 9 December 2013 which reviewed the work of the Department, but look forward to the rescheduled #
[normal]AskPickles
[normal] session on 22 January. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]My Ministerial team undertook to provide the Committee with some additional information as set out in your letter of 16 December. I will take these points in order:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]HCA transparency (Q 156) [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Information about HCA salaries is not included in DCLG's transparency data as it is the HCA’s responsibility to publish this. The HCA have now updated the
[normal] section of their website 
[normal]which deals with salary levels, 
[normal]and will ensure it is updated on a 
[normal]six-
[normal]monthly basis.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]HCA Chief Executive remuneration (Q 158) [bold]&#xa0;[bold]The HCA has a challenging, complex and increasingly special
[normal]ist delivery role on behalf of g
[normal]overnment. The exercise to recruit the current Chief Executive with an advertised salary of £142,000 did not attract the amount of interest hoped for. As a result of this 
[normal]the Department 
[normal]extend
[normal]ed
[normal] the recruitment process and advertise
[normal]d
[normal] an additional weighting to attract candidates with the relevant skills in the 
[normal]London
[normal] market. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The CEO’
[normal]s total remuneration comprises 
[normal]a 
[normal]base salary of £142,000 and a 
[normal]London
[normal] location allowance of £18,000. 
[normal]The
[normal] CEO has the contractual right to join the HCA pension scheme and claim car allowance payments but, to date, has not exercised these options
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Permanent Secretary of my Department,
[normal] the Chief Secretary to the Treasury
[normal] and I 
[normal]approved the 
[normal]London
[normal] location allowance. Should the post move to an office location outside of 
[normal]London
[normal],
[normal] the base salary of £142,000 would apply.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Qualification of accounts (Q 192) [bold]&#xa0;[bold]Following the qualification of the Department’s accounts
[normal],
[normal] the Department asked our internal audit service to investigate the cau
[normal]ses of the two qualifications.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We shared these reports with you in July this year
[normal],
[normal] along with our im
[normal]plementation plans for changes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]My officials are sending f
[normal]urther copies of the reports and p
[normal]lans to the Clerk for reference.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The internal audit service has now verified that the actions in the implementation plans have been completed, and reported this to D
[normal]CLG’s Audit and Risk Committee.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Private Rented Sector guarantee (Q 193) [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]We are making good progress on the Private Rented Sector Guarantee Scheme. In the absence of a delivery partner it is the Government's intention to consider applications for debt guarantees directly from the market. My officials have held discussions with a number of potential borrowers who are expressing serious interest. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To maximise the success of the scheme, 
[normal]we
[normal] remain 
[normal]committed to identifying 
[normal]a delivery partner that can administer the lending process and enable
[normal] access for 
[normal]smaller borrowers. 
[normal]There are positive signs of interest in the role from the 
[normal]financial markets
[normal], and I will keep you informed of progress
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]DCLG has put in place a specialist professional Credit Team with the commercial expertise to help deliver both Housing Guarantee Schemes effectively on behalf of taxpayers while managing the risk to 
[normal]g
[normal]overnment.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Local authority funding (Q 212) [bold]&#xa0;[bold]Brandon Lewis has written to the Chairman of the Audit Commission to seek a clarification of the basis of the data used in the Audit Commission's reports 
[normal]Tough Times
[normal] 2012 and 2013
[normal]. A copy of the letter is a
[normal]t
[normal]tached
[normal]. Our understanding is that the reports were based on published government data, but they used different definitions and assumptions – for example, using real terms figures rather than cash (which make reductions between years appear larger), or not including all the sources of council funding in their definition of local authority income.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We have asked the Audit Committee to clarify the position so that we all have a clear understanding, and we will forward to you the response from the Audit Commission when received.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Help to Buy Equity Loans scheme (Q 242) [bold]&#xa0;[bold]Kris Hopkins was referring to the number of newly built homes that had been purchased with the support of the Help to Buy equity loan scheme so far.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]My officials have already written to the Committee on 26 November regarding the number of homes that are likely to be built as a result of the scheme, and my 
[normal]Department will be keeping this under review as more data becomes available.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Rough sleeping (Q 252) [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Kris Hopkins suggested the recorded numbers of rough 
[normal]sleepers had recently declined.
[normal] In fact, the decline that has recently been recorded is not in the number of rough sleepers but in the number of households accepted by local authorities as owed a main homelessness duty. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The official 
[normal]Statutory Homelessness
[normal] statistics for July to September 2013, published a few days before the Sel
[normal]ect Committee hearing, show a 4 per cent
[normal] reduction in homelessness acceptances 
[normal]as well as a 10 per cent
[normal] reduction in families housed unlawfully in bed and breakfast accommodation for over 6 weeks compared to the same period in 2012.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Annual rough sleeping statistics are published in February each year
[normal] (see
[normal] 
[normal]https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/73200/Rough_Sleeping_Statistics_England_-_Autumn_2012.pdf
[normal])
[normal] and the next figures will be available in February 2014. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We took the important decision to introduce a more accurate assessment of rough sleeping levels to ensure we have a clearer national picture with information from every local authority. Figures collected previously did not include information from the majority of local authorities and so did not give a reliable assessment o
[normal]f the extent of rough sleeping.
[normal] As a result of the successful introduction of 
[normal]the ‘
[normal]No Second Night Out
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal]initiative in London, which we are 
[normal]supporting other areas across England
[normal] to take 
[normal]up, more rough sleepers are now being found and given the help they need. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Right to Buy (Q 259) [bold]&#xa0;[bold]As part of the reinvigoration of the Right to Buy policy in April 2012, this Government announced an aim that every additional council home sold 
[normal]–
[normal] that is, sales above the level forecasted before the changes were made 
[normal]–
[normal] would be replaced by a new home for affordable rent nationally.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Over 97 per cent of stock-holding local authorities have signed agreements to keep the additional receipts to fund replacement homes
[normal];
[normal] the additional receipts from the other councils 
[normal]are 
[normal]to be put into a central fund for the same purpose. Local authorities have up to 
[normal]three
[normal] years to use the receipts to help start or acquire replacement dwellings. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The income generated from sales is used by local authorities to cover the transaction costs, debt repayment on the properties, and planned income from the previously expected level of receipts (both the local authority and the 
[normal]g
[normal]overnment share). Any receipts from additional sales are then recycled directly into providing new affordable houses for rent. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Between the reinvigoration 
[normal]of Right to Buy 
[normal]in April 2012 
[normal]and 
[normal]31 October 2013, local authorities sold 10,953 homes. Approximately 6,300 of these sales are additional, and £219 million (out of £679 million in total) has been generated from additional sales receipts. From these receipts, 1,662 dwellings have already been started on site or acquired. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]Government does not require the replacement homes to be on a like-for-like basis because 
[normal]we believe
[normal] it should be up to local authorities to decide on the appropriate housing mix in their area. This ensures that local needs are met. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Private rented sector redress [bold]&#xa0;[bold]On 16 
[normal]October we announced we would develop a voluntary code of practice for the management of residential property in the private rented sector
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]O
[normal]n reflection
[normal],
[normal] we decided it makes sense for this to cover both lettings and property management
[normal].
[normal] Kris Hopkins
[normal]’s 
[normal]5 December 
[normal]letter to you sets out the 
[normal]latest position. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Once the voluntary code has been developed and is working well, we will consider approving it under section 87 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Development Act 1993
[normal], 
[normal]at which point it will replace the existing Rent Only Residential Management Code. However
[normal], 
[normal]the 1993 Act 
[normal]only gives 
[normal]Secretary of State power to approve codes that relate to the management of residential property
[normal] and not
[normal] 
[normal]to 
[normal]letting a property. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment
[normal]’s
[normal] position remains unchanged
[normal]: 
[normal]there has never been the intention to mandate that redress schemes use a single code of practice
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]Enterprise
[normal] and Regulatory Reform Act 2013 does not provide the power to mandate any such code of practice.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Council tax support [bold]&#xa0;[bold]Local authorities 
[normal]have a variety of duties and policies
[normal],
[normal] including welfare reform
[normal],
[normal] and all of these are covered by a duty to balance their budgets. Councils have considerable flexibilities to set income and spending levels and to move money between years to achieve thi
[normal]s. They can also draw on sector-
[normal]led targeted support to individual needs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Department for Work and Pensions is 
[normal]evaluating 
[normal]its 
[normal]various 
[normal]welfare 
[normal]reforms and 
[normal]will 
[normal]release regular statistics on households affected by them. New Burdens assessments were agreed for the reforms to 
[normal]the 
[normal]Local Housing Allowance, 
[normal]the b
[normal]enefit 
[normal]c
[normal]ap, 
[normal]r
[normal]emoval of the 
[normal]s
[normal]pare 
[normal]r
[normal]oom 
[normal]s
[normal]ubsidy and 
[normal]the 
[normal]Social Fund. In addition, DWP have agreed to fund new burdens arising from homelessness attributable to welfare reform. My Department is working with DWP on how to assess and measure that.
