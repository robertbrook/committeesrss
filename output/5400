defaultLetter from the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government dated 9 January 2014default (PD11)default&#xa0;defaultInquiry into the Performance of the Department Follow Updefault&#xa0;
defaultI apologise for being unable to attend the evidence session on 9 December 2013 which reviewed the work of the Department, but look forward to the rescheduled #
defaultAskPickles
default session on 22 January. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMy Ministerial team undertook to provide the Committee with some additional information as set out in your letter of 16 December. I will take these points in order:
default&#xa0;
defaultHCA transparency (Q 156) default&#xa0;
defaultInformation about HCA salaries is not included in DCLG's transparency data as it is the HCA’s responsibility to publish this. The HCA have now updated the
default section of their website 
defaultwhich deals with salary levels, 
defaultand will ensure it is updated on a 
defaultsix-
defaultmonthly basis.
default&#xa0;
defaultHCA Chief Executive remuneration (Q 158) default&#xa0;defaultThe HCA has a challenging, complex and increasingly special
defaultist delivery role on behalf of g
defaultovernment. The exercise to recruit the current Chief Executive with an advertised salary of £142,000 did not attract the amount of interest hoped for. As a result of this 
defaultthe Department 
defaultextend
defaulted
default the recruitment process and advertise
defaultd
default an additional weighting to attract candidates with the relevant skills in the 
defaultLondon
default market. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe CEO’
defaults total remuneration comprises 
defaulta 
defaultbase salary of £142,000 and a 
defaultLondon
default location allowance of £18,000. 
defaultThe
default CEO has the contractual right to join the HCA pension scheme and claim car allowance payments but, to date, has not exercised these options
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Permanent Secretary of my Department,
default the Chief Secretary to the Treasury
default and I 
defaultapproved the 
defaultLondon
default location allowance. Should the post move to an office location outside of 
defaultLondon
default,
default the base salary of £142,000 would apply.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultQualification of accounts (Q 192) default&#xa0;defaultFollowing the qualification of the Department’s accounts
default,
default the Department asked our internal audit service to investigate the cau
defaultses of the two qualifications.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe shared these reports with you in July this year
default,
default along with our im
defaultplementation plans for changes.
default&#xa0;
defaultMy officials are sending f
defaulturther copies of the reports and p
defaultlans to the Clerk for reference.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe internal audit service has now verified that the actions in the implementation plans have been completed, and reported this to D
defaultCLG’s Audit and Risk Committee.
default 
default&#xa0;defaultPrivate Rented Sector guarantee (Q 193) default&#xa0;
defaultWe are making good progress on the Private Rented Sector Guarantee Scheme. In the absence of a delivery partner it is the Government's intention to consider applications for debt guarantees directly from the market. My officials have held discussions with a number of potential borrowers who are expressing serious interest. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTo maximise the success of the scheme, 
defaultwe
default remain 
defaultcommitted to identifying 
defaulta delivery partner that can administer the lending process and enable
default access for 
defaultsmaller borrowers. 
defaultThere are positive signs of interest in the role from the 
defaultfinancial markets
default, and I will keep you informed of progress
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultDCLG has put in place a specialist professional Credit Team with the commercial expertise to help deliver both Housing Guarantee Schemes effectively on behalf of taxpayers while managing the risk to 
defaultg
defaultovernment.
default&#xa0;defaultLocal authority funding (Q 212) default&#xa0;defaultBrandon Lewis has written to the Chairman of the Audit Commission to seek a clarification of the basis of the data used in the Audit Commission's reports 
defaultTough Times
default 2012 and 2013
default. A copy of the letter is a
defaultt
defaulttached
default. Our understanding is that the reports were based on published government data, but they used different definitions and assumptions – for example, using real terms figures rather than cash (which make reductions between years appear larger), or not including all the sources of council funding in their definition of local authority income.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have asked the Audit Committee to clarify the position so that we all have a clear understanding, and we will forward to you the response from the Audit Commission when received.
default 
default&#xa0;defaultHelp to Buy Equity Loans scheme (Q 242) default&#xa0;defaultKris Hopkins was referring to the number of newly built homes that had been purchased with the support of the Help to Buy equity loan scheme so far.
default&#xa0;
defaultMy officials have already written to the Committee on 26 November regarding the number of homes that are likely to be built as a result of the scheme, and my 
defaultDepartment will be keeping this under review as more data becomes available.
default&#xa0;defaultRough sleeping (Q 252) default&#xa0;
defaultKris Hopkins suggested the recorded numbers of rough 
defaultsleepers had recently declined.
default In fact, the decline that has recently been recorded is not in the number of rough sleepers but in the number of households accepted by local authorities as owed a main homelessness duty. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe official 
defaultStatutory Homelessness
default statistics for July to September 2013, published a few days before the Sel
defaultect Committee hearing, show a 4 per cent
default reduction in homelessness acceptances 
defaultas well as a 10 per cent
default reduction in families housed unlawfully in bed and breakfast accommodation for over 6 weeks compared to the same period in 2012.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultAnnual rough sleeping statistics are published in February each year
default (see
default 
defaulthttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/73200/Rough_Sleeping_Statistics_England_-_Autumn_2012.pdf
default)
default and the next figures will be available in February 2014. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe took the important decision to introduce a more accurate assessment of rough sleeping levels to ensure we have a clearer national picture with information from every local authority. Figures collected previously did not include information from the majority of local authorities and so did not give a reliable assessment o
defaultf the extent of rough sleeping.
default As a result of the successful introduction of 
defaultthe ‘
defaultNo Second Night Out
default’
default 
defaultinitiative in London, which we are 
defaultsupporting other areas across England
default to take 
defaultup, more rough sleepers are now being found and given the help they need. 
default&#xa0;defaultRight to Buy (Q 259) default&#xa0;defaultAs part of the reinvigoration of the Right to Buy policy in April 2012, this Government announced an aim that every additional council home sold 
default–
default that is, sales above the level forecasted before the changes were made 
default–
default would be replaced by a new home for affordable rent nationally.
default&#xa0;
defaultOver 97 per cent of stock-holding local authorities have signed agreements to keep the additional receipts to fund replacement homes
default;
default the additional receipts from the other councils 
defaultare 
defaultto be put into a central fund for the same purpose. Local authorities have up to 
defaultthree
default years to use the receipts to help start or acquire replacement dwellings. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe income generated from sales is used by local authorities to cover the transaction costs, debt repayment on the properties, and planned income from the previously expected level of receipts (both the local authority and the 
defaultg
defaultovernment share). Any receipts from additional sales are then recycled directly into providing new affordable houses for rent. 
default&#xa0;
defaultBetween the reinvigoration 
defaultof Right to Buy 
defaultin April 2012 
defaultand 
default31 October 2013, local authorities sold 10,953 homes. Approximately 6,300 of these sales are additional, and £219 million (out of £679 million in total) has been generated from additional sales receipts. From these receipts, 1,662 dwellings have already been started on site or acquired. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultGovernment does not require the replacement homes to be on a like-for-like basis because 
defaultwe believe
default it should be up to local authorities to decide on the appropriate housing mix in their area. This ensures that local needs are met. 
default&#xa0;defaultPrivate rented sector redress default&#xa0;defaultOn 16 
defaultOctober we announced we would develop a voluntary code of practice for the management of residential property in the private rented sector
default.
default 
defaultO
defaultn reflection
default,
default we decided it makes sense for this to cover both lettings and property management
default.
default Kris Hopkins
default’s 
default5 December 
defaultletter to you sets out the 
defaultlatest position. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOnce the voluntary code has been developed and is working well, we will consider approving it under section 87 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Development Act 1993
default, 
defaultat which point it will replace the existing Rent Only Residential Management Code. However
default, 
defaultthe 1993 Act 
defaultonly gives 
defaultSecretary of State power to approve codes that relate to the management of residential property
default and not
default 
defaultto 
defaultletting a property. 
default&#xa0;
defaultT
defaulthe 
defaultG
defaultovernment
default’s
default position remains unchanged
default: 
defaultthere has never been the intention to mandate that redress schemes use a single code of practice
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe 
defaultEnterprise
default and Regulatory Reform Act 2013 does not provide the power to mandate any such code of practice.
default&#xa0;defaultCouncil tax support default&#xa0;defaultLocal authorities 
defaulthave a variety of duties and policies
default,
default including welfare reform
default,
default and all of these are covered by a duty to balance their budgets. Councils have considerable flexibilities to set income and spending levels and to move money between years to achieve thi
defaults. They can also draw on sector-
defaultled targeted support to individual needs.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Department for Work and Pensions is 
defaultevaluating 
defaultits 
defaultvarious 
defaultwelfare 
defaultreforms and 
defaultwill 
defaultrelease regular statistics on households affected by them. New Burdens assessments were agreed for the reforms to
