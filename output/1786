[normal]Summary
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]Background.
[normal]This submission is based on Llandovery, Carmarthenshire, to highlight the public transport problems in this rural area. 
[normal]The main form of transport, as in all rural areas, being the private car.
[normal]Transport is needed for employment, further educa
[normal]tion, hospital visits, entertainment and shopping.
[normal]The main problems are lack of transport combined with the lack of co-ordination between modes of transport resulting in difficulties
[normal] for both able and disabled members of the community.
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Existing provision
[normal].
[normal]Llandovery is on the A40 and is served by:
[normal]1)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Three bus routes via various villages to  Carmarthen
[normal]   Brecon
[normal]   Lampeter 
[normal]2)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Heart of Wales railway line from Swansea to Shrewsbury via several small towns, with connections
[normal] 
[normal]to London from Swansea and the north a
[normal]nd the midlands from Shrewsbury.

[normal]4)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Two private taxi services.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Problems with the current infrastructure
[normal].
[normal]The low number of bus services 
[normal]combined with the length of the journey and the limited time available for activities.
[normal]The poor links between train and bus for onward travel.
[normal]The non - existent connections between the town and neighbouring villages.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Link between train and bus service extremely poor.
[normal]eg the bus to Brecon departs Llandovery train station at 10.40, the train arrives from Swansea at 10.37 allowing just 3mins for the connection.
[normal]No connection if the train is late.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Lack of services
[normal] to/from nearby villages not on the A40 corridor.
[normal]Surrounding villages used to connect to Llandovery by the Post Bus.
[normal]Thi
[normal]s service has been discontinued
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There are many villages and communities that have no access to public transport
[normal] at all.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]Resulting problems for the local community
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Young people 
[normal]unable to access after school activities, no transport home.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]People out of work, school leavers, work placement people, those struggling with poor mental health issues and those wit
[normal]h physical and learning disabilities  - an efficient transport system would increase access to work opportunities for them.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]18-25 year olds have to pay a high premium for car insurance which restricts those who might have a car. The young who do not live 
[normal]in towns are severely limited in their access to work, cultural activities and socialising. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Families – affected by cost of keeping a car on the road, eg  a two car family having to give up one car resulting in limitations on access to out of school activ
[normal]ities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Able bodied adults who are non drivers have to rely on neighbours or expensive taxi services to travel into Llandovery, eg  £30 return fare from Rhandirmwyn to Llandovery
[normal] – a distance of seven miles.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Adults with mobility problems are dependant on 
[normal]others being able to visit them for social and caring services.

[normal]5)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]Suggested solutions
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Buses  - increase the number of services to
[normal] include evenings 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Trains – add one extra service per day in each direction
[normal] at appropriate times.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Transport links – 
[normal]realistic co-ordination of timetables, this should be feasible as both buses and trains are operated by Arriva.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Links to nearby villages – introduce a dial-up request mini-bus service.
[normal]A service entitled Bwcabus operates in the western half of the county 
[normal]only. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Rural areas require direct buses linking town to town centres, with feeder minibuses from surrounding villages. 
[normal]The times of trains and buses should facilitate work in the mornings and socialising in the evenings.
