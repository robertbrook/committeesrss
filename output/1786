defaultSummary
default&#xa0;
default1)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default 
defaultBackground.
defaultThis submission is based on Llandovery, Carmarthenshire, to highlight the public transport problems in this rural area. 
defaultThe main form of transport, as in all rural areas, being the private car.
defaultTransport is needed for employment, further educa
defaulttion, hospital visits, entertainment and shopping.
defaultThe main problems are lack of transport combined with the lack of co-ordination between modes of transport resulting in difficulties
default for both able and disabled members of the community.
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultExisting provision
default.
defaultLlandovery is on the A40 and is served by:
default1)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThree bus routes via various villages to  Carmarthen
default   Brecon
default   Lampeter

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHeart of Wales railway line from Swansea to Shrewsbury via several small towns, with connections
default 
defaultto London from Swansea and the north a
defaultnd the midlands from Shrewsbury.

defaultCounty Cars a volunteer run car service initiated by the WRVS for essential journeys  ie  hospital appointments.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTwo private taxi services.  
default&#xa0;
default3)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultProblems with the current infrastructure
default.
defaultThe low number of bus services 
defaultcombined with the length of the journey and the limited time available for activities.
defaultThe poor links between train and bus for onward travel.
defaultThe non - existent connections between the town and neighbouring villages.

default&#xa0;
defaultLink between train and bus service extremely poor.
defaulteg the bus to Brecon departs Llandovery train station at 10.40, the train arrives from Swansea at 10.37 allowing just 3mins for the connection.
defaultNo connection if the train is late.
default&#xa0;
defaultLack of services
default to/from nearby villages not on the A40 corridor.
defaultSurrounding villages used to connect to Llandovery by the Post Bus.
defaultThi
defaults service has been discontinued
default. 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are many villages and communities that have no access to public transport
default at all.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default 
defaultResulting problems for the local community
default:
default&#xa0;
defaultYoung people 
defaultunable to access after school activities, no transport home.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultPeople out of work, school leavers, work placement people, those struggling with poor mental health issues and those wit
defaulth physical and learning disabilities  - an efficient transport system would increase access to work opportunities for them.
default&#xa0;
default18-25 year olds have to pay a high premium for car insurance which restricts those who might have a car. The young who do not live 
defaultin towns are severely limited in their access to work, cultural activities and socialising. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFamilies – affected by cost of keeping a car on the road, eg  a two car family having to give up one car resulting in limitations on access to out of school activ
defaultities.
default&#xa0;
defaultAble bodied adults who are non drivers have to rely on neighbours or expensive taxi services to travel into Llandovery, eg  £30 return fare from Rhandirmwyn to Llandovery
default – a distance of seven miles.
default&#xa0;
defaultAdults with mobility problems are dependant on 
defaultothers being able to visit them for social and caring services.
default 
default&#xa0;

default 
defaultSuggested solutions
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultBuses  - increase the number of services to
default include evenings 
default&#xa0;
defaultTrains – add one extra service per day in each direction
default at appropriate times.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultTransport links – 
defaultrealistic co-ordination of timetables, this should be feasible as both buses and trains are operated by Arriva.
default&#xa0;
defaultLinks to nearby villages – introduce a dial-up request mini-bus service.
defaultA service entitled Bwcabus operates in the western half of the county 
defaultonly. 
default&#xa0;
defaultRural areas require direct buses linking town to town centres, with feeder minibuses from surrounding villages. 
defaultThe times of trains and buses should facilitate work in the mornings and socialising in the evenings.
