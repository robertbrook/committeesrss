[[[(HOT17)]]]A1 - Is the government taking the right approach to reduce heat energy demand?

[[[A1.1]]] Reducing heat energy demand with primary heat appliances requires growth in heat pumps and higher efficiency replacement technology eg modern dynamic electric storage heaters. BEAMA welcomes the RHI as this will stimulate heat pump demand but believe that a more strategic market development programme is required to deliver a sustainable long term supply chain (see A5 on Renewable Heat Zones). 

[[[A1.2]]] BEAMA believes there should be a stronger policy programme to promote replacement electric storage heaters. There are 6.5 million electric storage heaters in UK homes, supplying 9% of the total housing stock, with a current installed capacity of 105 GW. As such the energy saving and load shifting potential of replacing these with the latest generation products is significant. If a replacement of all electric storage heaters is completed, it will bring a reduction in CO2 emissions of 1.26 Mton. However there are currently only 224,000 replacements of electric storage heaters per year, so there is significant capacity to increase the rate of replacement and achieve the CO2 savings far sooner.

[[[A1.3 ]]]Data produced by BEAMA in 2009 with the Energy Saving Trust indicated that there were millions of UK homes without a reasonable level of heating controls. Specifically, the data showed that around 8 million homes don’t have a room thermostat and 9 million homes don’t have TRVs (thermostatic radiator valves). New research carried out on behalf of the controls manufacturers’ association within BEAMA shows that the installation of effective temperature controls on home heating systems has a far more significant effect on minimising energy use than has previously been predicted. Independent tests were carried out by the University of Salford on the performance of heating controls in their Energy House facility. This facility consists of a full size house built within an environmental chamber, and is designed to monitor energy consumption before and after retrofit measures are installed so that the true effectiveness of new and existing technologies to reduce energy can be assessed. The tests showed that energy consumption by heating systems can be reduced by up to 40% through the installation of a room thermostat and TRVs. 

[[[A1.4 ]]]The top line results from the tests are shown in the table below. 

[[[Tests carried out]]]

[[[24 hr heating cost]]]

[[[Reduced cost from controls]]]1 - No temperature control (other than boiler stat)£5.310%2 – Control by room thermostat only£4.6812.0%3 – Control by room thermostat + TRVs£3.1540.7%&#xa0;

[[[A1.5 ]]]The scale of savings shown in these tests is significantly better than what is generally assumed, particularly for TRVs. The same house had an assessment carried out using the SAP methodology, which is the standard calculation tool used by Government in many of its policy tools such as the Green Deal. Under this tool the energy savings from the addition of TRVs is estimated at 2%, rather than the approximate 30% savings shown under the actual tests. On the basis of this new evidence Government should be doing more to ensure that the full scope for demand reduction through the application of controls in all UK homes is realised in practice. In practice we would recommend that:1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It should be made a requirement under Part L of the building regulations that TRVs are installed when a boiler is replaced. At present it is only recommended as good practice even though the installation of TRVs is much more economic when a boiler is replaced as the system will already be drained down.2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It should be mandatory that properties receiving heating measures under the Green Deal have both a room thermostat and TRVs. As well as the savings from these measures themselves it is clear from the University of Salford research that a hydronic heating system will only operate as intended with appropriate controls installed.  

[[[A1.6]]] Information from members shows many domestic heating systems are not flushed with water treatment chemicals following installation of a new boiler or new entire system. This means installation debris remains in the system, leading to corrosion of system components. Corrosion leads to further obstructive debris (sludge) in radiators that can reduce their overall effectiveness by up to 15%, and reduce boiler efficiency by 2-3%. Chemically cleaning a heating system is recommended by the Building Regulations Domestic Compliance Guide, so the correct recommendation is in place, but the Guide is not followed frequently enough in practice meaning many domestic heating systems are operating at efficiency below their potential.

[[[A1.7 ]]]Building Regulations have been successful in transforming the gas heating market to condensing technology but a programme is now required leading to A+ heat systems being regulated for installation from 2020. 

[[[A1.8 ]]]There is no policy at all for the development of high efficiency storage methods for hot water (e.g. promotion and incentivising of super insulated cylinders using new insulants rather than increasing thickness of insulation).&#xa0;A2 - What progress is the government making on reducing the demand for heat?

[[[A2.1 ]]]In terms of heat pumps progress has been very slow. Market growth in 2008/9 has flattened (less than 20,000 units per annum) with very little success in the one-off private market. This means the fourth carbon budget projections are unlikely to be met even with a successful RHI roll out unless a more focused strategic plan is deployed (see A5 on Renewable Heat Zones). 

[[[A2.2]]] Electric storage was promoted in the Government's 2012 paper 'The Future of Heating', and mentioned in places in the 2013 follow up paper, but there needs to be a plan to switch old electric storage technology to modern high efficiency electric storage alternatives.  There are 6.5 million electric storage heaters in UK homes, supplying 9% of the total housing stock, with a current installed capacity of 105 GW. As such the energy saving and load shifting potential of replacing these with the latest generation products is significant. If a replacement of all electric storage heaters is completed, it will bring a reduction in CO2 emissions of 1.26 Mton. However there are currently only 224,000 replacements of electric storage heaters per year, so there is significant capacity to increase the rate of replacement and achieve the CO2 savings far sooner.&#xa0;A3 - What are the relative merits of using gas to directly provide space heating compared to centralised electricity production plus domestic heat pumps?

[[[A3.1 ]]]According to Sutherland Tables figures (April 2013), an air source heat pump with space heating efficiency of 250% is more cost effective in a 3 bed semi versus gas condensing equivalent (£960 vs £1022 per annum).  However, at this stage the difference is marginal and the main target for heat pumps is off the gas network where savings can justify the increased capital cost of heat pump installation.  

[[[A3.2 ]]]However, this does not factor in the supply chain cost benefit of Demand Side Response when switching to heat pumps. It should also be noted that as electricity grid carbon intensity decreases there will be social value in switching to heat pumps. &#xa0;A4 - Why does the RHI not seem to promote heat pumps successfully?

[[[A4.1 ]]]It is currently too early to make a judgement on the domestic RHI but BEAMA is satisfied that the tariff levels will provide a suitable incentive at this stage.  However, we are concerned that there has been a significant delay in the scheme launch which has held the market back and we now need more focus on zone promotion (see A5 on Renewable Heat Zones).  Also, Green Deal and ECO need to have a greater emphasis on heat pump promotion as the GD plans currently favour conventional heat technology over heat pumps due to the golden rule and absence of link to RHI subsidy. 

[[[A4.2 ]]]In addition to this response we do foresee some customer confusion when trying to combine the schemes, or indeed if they are not combined.  On the latter point we advocate that all Green Deal assessors have sufficient RHI and technology training so that even if the EPC recommends an oil boiler replacement (condensing for non-condensing), the assessor can additionally promote the non EPC related benefits of heat pump savings and significant RHI income potential.  If this is not properly managed, customers may end up buying oil boilers then finding out down the line that they could have had much higher net benefits by buying a heat pump.  We can foresee some problems when combining the schemes.  For example, if a customer has a Green Deal assessment, it will provide very standardised house and occupancy data that will differ from that provided by the competent installer who will undertake a full heat loss calculation and use specific heat pump data.  This performance gap may prove a turn off for customers who will question the validity of opposing data.  &#xa0;

[[[A4.3 ]]]As a final point, we have advised DECC that the requirement for a Green Deal assessment is likely to prove a barrier to take up as has been proven with the dramatic drop off of RHPP voucher levels since the RHPP was linked to Green Deal assessments in April/May 2013. Our preferred initial entry criteria would be a simplified EPC. A5 – Evidence relevant to A1, A2 and A4

[[[Background]]]

[[[A5.1 ]]]In 2012, DECC attended a BEAMA meeting at which it was suggested that the Government was exploring the opportunities for developing ‘Renewable Hubs’ under which there would be the over-riding objectives for ‘areas of mass deployment’.  Discussions with some BEAMA members and outside influencers has suggested this is a sound idea but may need tuning to be an all encompassing and market stimulating activity.

[[[The Case for Renewab]]]

[[[le Heat Zones]]]

[[[A5.2 ]]]The Government has already outlined a high heat pump uptake scenario off the gas network up to 2020.  There currently exists a number of incentives and policy mechanisms to stimulate the uptake of heat pumps and renewable heat technologies generally.  These include the Energy Company Obligation, The Renewable Heat Incentive (currently in Premium Payment format for one off domestic customers) and, to a lesser extent, Green Deal.  All of these are underpinned by the Microgeneration Certification Scheme.  

[[[A5.3 ]]]Despite the policy weight there remain a number of practical issues that may be alleviated by the development of Renewable Heat Zones:&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[A5.4 ]]]An RHZ has appeal for the following supply chain actors:&#xa0;&#xa0;              &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[What Would The RHZ Do?]]]

[[[A5.5 ]]]In the 1990s, Local Authorities were bound by the Home Energy Conservation Act to develop and implement plans to promote energy efficiency in their area.  The Energy Saving Trust developed a support programme called HECAction and through this programme the lead authority would commit to a plan which would be seed corn funded.  

[[[A5.6 ]]]An RHZ would operate similarly but on a voluntary basis.  In principle, the lead authority/body in an RHZ would work with the above supply chain actors to formulate a 3-5 year plan for renewable heat growth.  Within this plan there would be absolute targets for renewable heat deployment based on an understanding of the RHZ customer/dwelling types and propensity for take up.  For example, an objective may be to install 30,000 heat pumps in the RHZ over 3 years.  This type of objective gives confidence to installers that a market is planned; provides an impetus for marketing effort; gives planning signals to the network operator to channel business plan funding under ED1; brings energy suppliers to the fore with tariffs; shines a light on training and certification hot spots; creates positive customer perceptions in the area; allows merchants and others to channel their support.

[[[A5.7 ]]]The practicality is that such an approach can require seed corn funding to kick start the project which may subsidise initial resources required e.g. a co-ordinator on the ground, marketing etc.

[[[How To Deliver RHZs]]]

[[[A5.8 ]]]There are a number of ways to deliver this framework but there are three major requirements:September 2013&#xa0;
