[normal]Written evidence from the
[normal]Association of Policing and Crime Chief Executives
[normal] [PCC Progress 03]
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]We note with interest that 
[normal]the 
[normal]terms of reference 
[normal]for the upcoming 
[normal]HASC 
[normal]refer to
[normal] “the role of the PCP in 
[normal]holding
[normal] to account
[normal] the PCC”. 
[normal]As this is not an accurate reflection of the legislation w
[normal]e believe that this 
[normal]has the potential to confuse the public understanding 
[normal]of the way 
[normal]in which 
[normal]police and crime panels 
[normal]actually 
[normal]work. 
[normal]The
[normal] more accurate view is that 
[normal]p
[normal]olice and 
[normal]c
[normal]rime 
[normal]p
[normal]anel
[normal]s 
[normal]must be
[normal] established 
[normal]by local authorities in order 
[normal]to 
[normal]scrutinize
[normal] 
[normal]the decisions and actions of 
[normal]their PCC
[normal] and to exercise their function
[normal]s
[normal] in a way that supports the PCC.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The distinction 
[normal]between ‘holding to account’ and any other relationship in the governance arrangements may seem slight but this is not semantics; it is a key component of the new constitutional model, something that – as Committee members will be aware - wa
[normal]s evident in the 
[normal]debates during the passage of the Bill and the subsequent 
[normal]statutory framework
[normal] established under the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The
[normal] express duties of ‘holding to account’ and the relationship that this implies are fundamental to the new governance arrangements for policing and crime.  
[normal] 
[normal]The PCC (or the 
[normal]London
[normal] equivalent) holds the
[normal]ir
[normal] chief officer of police to account for the delive
[normal]ry of policing in their area, while t
[normal]he PCC is, in turn, held to account by their electorate.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]T
[normal]he PCP 
[normal]has a number of key statutory functions
[normal],
[normal] principally around the setting of the local precept, the Police and Crime Plan and the appointment of senior officer holders; the 
[normal]p
[normal]anel is also responsible for dealing with non-criminal complaints about the conduct of the PCC and their deputy if they have one. The PCP 
[normal]must support the effective exercise of the functions of PCC.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We 
[normal]request
[normal] that
[normal] 
[normal]this issue of clarification 
[normal]is brought to the attention of the Chair 
[normal]and 
[normal]hope that these brief but important points 
[normal]will assist the committee
[normal] in their deliberations
[normal].
