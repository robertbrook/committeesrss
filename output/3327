defaultPRIVATISATION OF ROYAL MAILdefault&#xa0;default1  Introductiondefault1.1
default              
defaultI am a leading UK and European postal expert
default and have been the leading media commentator on the sector over the last five years, commenting regularly on national news and in the press.   I was
default a key member of the teams which opened up the UK mail market to competition (at Postcomm) and EU mail marke
defaultts to competition (at DG Internal Market of the European Commission)
default.  More recently, I
default have advised the NAO on the withdrawal of retail price controls in the energy, postal and telecoms markets, and
default Consumer Focus and competing postal operators on postal 
defaultissues.  
defaultIn 2011
default,
default I wrote a strategy for consumers in the postal industry for 
defaultConsumer Focus
default having chaired stakeholder meetings across the UK with speakers including Ed Davey and Richard Hooper. 
default I
defaultn my advice to the consumer body I
default predicted
default (contrary to 
defaultthe analysis contained in the Hooper report) 
defaultthat Royal Mail could return to profitability without privatization.

default              
defaultAs a Partner at Trova Consulting
default, I 
default(with a colleague) 
defaultwrote a valuation report of Royal Mail in 2011 which valued the company (in a base 
defaultcase) at 
default£
default5.7 billion.  Whilst this was heavily publicized in national media, BIS

default  I write now at the request of Ian Murray MP
default,
default having commented 
defaulton the BBC national news o
defaultn the low nature of the Royal
default Mail pricing before and during the float.  During the float process I have been advising Investment Bank analysts and fund managers on the postal market and regulatory development.

default              
defaultIn considering 
defaultthe handling of the privatization of Royal Mail and the considerable undervaluation of the business t
defaulthe Select Committee should seek to understand how far the sale served the public interest in a broader context (

defaultthan purely whether BIS
default followed due process in

default              
defaultIn this broader context
default it can be a

defaultnot
default always
default been
default well
default served by the process of the privatization of Royal Mail.
default  In particular it has not been served in respect of:

defaultRecommendations
default3.1
default              
defaultI would not recommend a further sale of the government’s stake in the business until it has moved towards a better understand
defaulting
default of 
defaultthe market and of how to achieve its objectives in the sector
default which is an essential infrastructure for the new economy
default.  For example
default,
default it may regret a 
defaultfull s
defaultale of the business which led to excessive returns for private investors (exploiting light touch pri
defaultce regulation or asset sales at the business) or to excessive returns generated by severe cost cutting and headcount reductions.  
defaultRealistically I understand that such a sale is likely to go ahead and in this case I consider that the government or Ofcom may
default soon need to review their approach to future postal regulation if postal consumers or customers are to be protected from a powerful private provider of an essential service.

defaultThe sale was not necessary to safeguard Royal Mail or the universal postal services
default and it was not necessary to increase prices
default significantly
default to increase margins  
defaultT
defaulthe public interest in relation to postal services
default4.2
default              
defaultThe public inte
defaultrest can be best served by ensuring the provision of postal services (including universal postal services) which are reliable, cost efficient and of high quality.   Postal services provide a vital delivery infrastructure for the economy in respect of commu
defaultnications and, increasingly, as a means of low cost distribution of e-commerce.  Lower costs and greater efficiency in postal services benefit the wider economy, in particular in
default reducing costs for businesses and
default stimulating the development of 
defaulte
default commerce. 
default    
defaultPrivatisation and postal services
default4.3
default              
defaultGlobally, universal postal services are usually provided by national posts in the public sector.  In the EU, which has moved most quickly to reform the sector, there has been only a gradual and cautious move to privatize national posts, with successful and
default efficient national posts operating both within and outside the public sector.  It is therefore counter-intuitive to state that privatization is essential to ensure postal services, which implies that postal services may soon fail across most of the world.

defaultNationa
default              
defaultl posts and financial performance
default4.4
default              
defaultIn practice national posts remain in a fairly cossetted or insulated financial situation compared to most businesses, revenues are largely safeguarded going forward (mail volume declines offset by a changing 
defaultvolume composition and by e-commerce traffic growth) and costs are set through wage level choices and also the pace of achievement of efficiency gains.  Although most national posts have not pursued profit maximization strategies, (which renders internatio
defaultnal benchmarking less useful) margins can be significantly increased both through raising prices (where the national  post retains market power) and/or becoming more cost efficient by reducing headcount, making costs more flexible or restraining wages.    
defaultWhere national posts have been privatized they have made significant returns in letters products through increased prices and through a process of cost reduction which remains ongoing.  
default&#xa0;
defaultRoyal Mail’s position in the UK as the universal service provider 
default4.
default5
default              
defaultRoyal Mail as the traditional provider of the universal postal service enjoys a legacy of significant market power in the delivery of postal items, particularly in respect of letters and low weight standard parcels.
default  
defaultThe profitability or otherwise of its
default universal service provision as a whole is determined by the level of postal volumes, the level of wage costs at Royal Mail, technical efficiency at the business and the level of its prices.  Increases for example in wages will apparently increase the “net
default costs of the universal service”, whereas greater cost efficiency or price rises will reduce it.  
defaultFuture demand for postal delivery
default4.6
default              
defaultUsage of the postal delivery network has changed over time with traditional communications products declining but being
default replaced by advertising (direct) mail and now by e commerce traffic.  Whilst postal providers such as Royal Mail have found it difficult to innovate and
default have
default regularly predict
defaulted
default the imminent end of their business, dynamism in the wider economy has continu
defaulted to find an outlet in the universal postal delivery network, which retains economies of scope and scale which offset its relative technical and cost inefficiency.  Royal Mail enjoys around 40% of the e commerce delivery market
default,
default with many
default other
default companies
default 
defaultalso
default delivering to the door every week
default.  First mover advantage in this market represents a significant commercial opportunity going forward.  
default 
defaultThe level of postal volumes and its financial effects
default4.7
default              
defaultI
defaultt appears that (adjusting for the effects of the cycl

defaultit would be cautious to assume that 
defaultthere is an underlying 
defaultpredictable
default annual decline across mature postal markets
default of mail volumes
default of around

defaultFor Royal Mail the effects of this decline can be offset by:

defaultPrice rises versus efficiency gains as a mechanism for increased 
defaultmargins
default4.8
default              
defaultFinancial modelling suggests that p
defaultrice rises are a less successful means of raising margins than increased cost efficiency.  This is due to loss in volumes from price rises
default. F
defaultostering greater cost efficiency
default with relatively small year on year 
defaultcost saving can significantly increase margins over time.  
default 
defaultFurther benefits of lower postal prices are passed on throughout the economy increasing competitiveness and employment. 
default   
defaultHooper recommendations 
default4.9
default              
defaultAt the start of the sale process, Royal Mail
default continued to be in a fairly cossetted commercial situation compared to most businesses but
default was making low returns due to the effects of the downturn, a bloated cost base, 
defaultits pension fund deficit and a fussy price control process
default.
default  Hooper was right to 
defaultrec
defaultommend removing the pension deficit, which provided it with a significant commercial cushion and to query the complexity and acrimony which had arisen over price control regulation. 
default4.10
default              
defaultHowever, the market analysis used to justify privatization overstate
defaultd risks to the business.  Royal Mail could raise margins further under state ownership
default 
defaultthrough price rises or cost efficiency measures
default as had happened in other EU Member States
default and privatization itself was not necessary to save the business.  Arguments for
default additional capital expenditure (beyond that already funded during the process of the sale) were 
defaultvague
default and 
defaultit was unclear why this could not be funded under state control given that such expenditures have been financed in
default this way
default across the EU.
default 
defaultConclusio
defaultns
default4.11
default              
defaultI
defaultt is
default unfortunate that the
default privatization process
default had
default led to significant price rises at Royal Mail.   As suggested earlier the public interest is best served by cost efficient and high quality postal services.  According to ONS figures if postal pri
defaultces go up then the wider effects on the economy are a net reduction in employment.
default  Based on a price rise of 20% at price elasticity of -0.3 we could expect a net employment impact of around 10.000 jobs over time.  Increased postal prices lower postal vol
defaultumes and reduce
defaultd
default growth in the e-commerce market, which may damage national competitiveness.

default  
default4.12
default              
defaultIn the context of t
defaulthe privatization of Royal Mail, 
defaultit can be argued that the public interest
default is best served by ensuring that the sale is achieved at the correct company valuation and that the company has then strong incentives to be cost efficient and innovative.
default4.13
default              
defaultIn pra
defaultctice t
defaulthe company has been sold at just over half its value and the lack of regulatory oversight of the company provides it with
default clear
default incentives to increase margins through a further round of price rises which will damage the postal market and reduce national competitiveness.
defaultThe value of Royal Mail
default4.14
default              
defaultAs stated earlier, 
defaultRoyal Mail remains in an unusual commercial position.  It has a 
defaultlargely predictable recurring
default base
default revenue line (a situation most businesses would die for) and can set most of its own costs (labour costs equal around 55% of revenues) through its wage levels.
default4.15
default              
defaultGiven this it is unsurprising that it has been able to r
defaultaise margins over the last few years through price rises, (and removal of the pensions’ deficit)
default,
default though it has shared the proceeds
default of the rise
default with its staff through the pay settlement, limiting the actual effect on margins.  
defaultProspects for raising margindefaults furtherdefault4.16
default              
defaultT
defaulthe business has significant scope to cut its costs further
default if it so chooses following the capital expenditures recently made.
default  
defaultFurther,
default it can again raise revenues through price rises.  Ofcom
default has indicated already that it expects Royal Mail to raise margins.   
default&#xa0;
defaultRisks to the businessdefault4.17
default              
defaultGiven this Royal Mail could be considered to have a 
default‘
defaultlicence to print money
default’
default as it were subject to two constraints:
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSelf-inflicted risks of industrial action.
default  The company has a legacy of industrial disputes.  
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRisks of a greater level of mail volumes decline
default due to electronic substitution
default or greater 
defaultdelivery 
defaultcompetition. 
default4.18
default              
defaultClearly risks of industrial action have weighed heavily during the process of the sa
defaultle and are quoted both in the prospectus of Royal Mail and in the Secretary of State’s letter
default. However, 
defaultit is debatable whether such threats represent a real danger to the business.  Industrial action over recent years has been disruptive rather than signi
defaultficant
default.  Further 
defaultas post
defaultal delivery
default has become more about distribution than communication, and as alternatives to postal services have emerged, the nuisance of a protracted industrial dispute has abated
default limiting the power of the threat.    
default 
default4.19
default              
defaultOther ana
defaultlysts have commented on how such strikes may actually increase the value of the business in demonstrating management determination to reduce costs.

default              
defaultMail volumes
default declin
defaulte
default due to electronic substitution
default have been discussed earlier.  In relation to end
default-
defaultto
default-
default end delivery competition it is noticeable that Ofcom has proposed to intervene if competition for traditional letters delivery becomes more significant.  In any case Royal Mail already competes in a wider postal market which incorporates e-commerce deliv
defaultery and can gain as well as lose market share.
default  It is moving to a more normal commercial situation than before.
defaultOur analysis
default 
default   
default4.21
default              
defaultThe analysis undertaken at Trova
default came to the following assessment of potential margins across three scenarios- one our base case which was
default largely
default as is now and
default assumes increases in margins fo
defaultllowing some future efficiency gains
default/price rises
default, one a scenario of protracted industrial action
default and failed efficiency drive
default and one of industrial action combined with rapid volumes decline.  This suggested the following future margins at the company.

defaultTh
defaultes
defaulte margi
defaultns
default suggested a base case valuation of 
default£
default5.7bn (after debt).
default4.23
default              
defaultIn light of current valuations, clearly the market has taken the view that although there are risks, they are offset by the commercial opportunities available to the company both to inc
defaultrease margins in its traditional letters delivery and to grow revenues in e commerce delivery.  For example were mail volumes to decline more rapidly, then the business could increase the pace of its efficiency improvements or raise prices more steeply.  
default4.24
default              
defaultFurther, our analysis 
defaultdid not take account
default of the effects of such steep price rises at Royal Mail as have occurred over the last couple of years, though we did assume that the business would at least get a return on the capital investment made.    
defaultWh
defaulty was the company so undervalued? 
default4.25
default              
defaultIn light of the above how then can the undervaluation of the business be explained, even 
defaultconsidering that the government would have wished to attract investors?
defaultThe argumentation for the sale
default4.26
default              
defaultIn part the origins
default of the undervaluation lie in the Hooper Report which presented an over-gloomy view   of postal market development, focusing on negative market trends (electronic substitution of letters exacerbated by economic downturn) and financial problems at Royal Mai
defaultl rather than looking at the market as a whole.  
defaultThe results of this led to a strange argumentation for the sale which ran along the lines of “this business is falling apart and soon to die…please buy it.”
default4.27
default              
defaultWhilst this may have been seen as politically
default necessary it was a very weak starting point for a negotiations with city investors and, it can be argued that this by itself may have been a cause of undervaluation.
default&#xa0;
defaultRegulatory capture
default4.28
default              
defaultThe undervaluation also reflects weaknesses in the manner that BI
defaultS has handled its stewardship of the postal industry.   This has included a tendency to become captured by Royal Mail’s view of the postal business and to place too high a priority on short term political risks for Ministers (in relation to concerns over p
defaultostal strikes or service failures).  
default4.29
default              
defaultDuring the process of the sale Postcomm and Consumer Focus, which represented customer and consumer interests and provided an independent perspective were both scrapped and a more light touch regulatory regime put
default in place.
default4.30
default              
defaultFaced with this legacy of unbalanced argumentation about the potential for rapid decline of the business and with a departmental advice which reflected a very cautious view of the prospects for the business, it was difficult for Ministers t
defaulto take a more objective view of its potential for commercial success.
defaultLack of alternative voices in the process of the sale 
default    
default4.31
default              
defaultMinisters went down a conventional route in seeking advice on the valuation
default asking Investment banks who knew little about the postal sector and about Royal Mail in particular.  This was reflected in the wide valuations. Faced with suggestions that Royal Mail may be worth much more money, advisors and Ministers, 
defaultunsurprisingly vie
defaultwed any dissenting valuation (compared to over-negative ones) with skepticism.  
defaultIn practice an objective view was only likely to come from outside BIS and
default from the enthusiasm of buyers
default during the process of the float.
default  However, e
defaultven when faced with clear e
defaultvidence of over subscription of the sale,
default Ministers could not believe that previous advice was incorrect and
default seeing the political risks of a failed sale
default continued to undervalue the business.
default           
defaultGaming strategies during the process of the sale
default4.32
default              
defaultIt is also likely that the government’s attempt to tilt the ownership of the business towards long term and passive investor led it towards undervaluation.  
defaultRecommendationsdefault4.33
default              
defaultIn light of the above analysis, I would not recommend a further sale of the g
defaultovernment’s stake in the business until it has moved towards a better understanding of the market and of how to achieve its objectives in the sector
default which is an essential infrastructure for the new economy. 
default  For example it may regret a full sale of the bu
defaultsiness which led to excessive returns for private investors (exploiting light touch price regulation or asset sales at the business) or to excessive returns generated by severe cost cutting and headcount reductions.  Realistically I understand that such a 
defaultsale is likely to go ahead and in this case I consider that the government or Ofcom may soon need to review their approach to future postal regulation if postal consumers or customers are to be protected from a powerful private provider of an essential ser
defaultvice.
