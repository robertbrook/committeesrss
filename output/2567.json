"&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by Gosport Council&#xa0;1.0              Executive Summary&#xa0;1.1\n              \nThis Council is of the view that support, care or supervision elements of the exempt accommodation definition are met by the activities undertaken in the Council’s owned hostels\n (used for statutory homeless placements)\n. \nHowever, the exclusion of district councils within the exempt accommodation definition means that these hostels will not be exempt under Universal Credit (UC).\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n              \nThis report for the Committee sets out:\n&#xa0;\n2.0              Background&#xa0;\n2.1\n              \nGosport Council has relied upon Council managed hostels to accommodate the statutory homeless for many years. However, all th\ne hostel buildings were in need of disposal or refurbishment.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nGosport Council received Government approval to increase borrowing (Housing Revenue Account, HRA) to enable a new homeless person’s hostel to be developed in 2012. In addition, this Council\ns HRA is now committed to self- financing the refurbishment of one of the retained hostels. The total capital expenditure \nfor the newly developed hostel and refurbished hostel \nis \nin the region of £2 million.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n              \nThe total Council hostel capacity\n,\n after th\ne 2\nnd\n hostel is refurbished\n,\n will be 83 units of varying sizes. At present the Council has 67 units although 12 of these are part of the refurbishment plan. Even with this hostel capacity\n a small number of households are currently being accommodated in Bed &amp; Breakfast (6 at 30/6/13).  The final refurbished hostel building will come on line in February 2014, giving the 83 unit capacity.\n The Council has its own in-house supporting people fun\nded service for homeless households with a contracted capacity of 100, but at just over 1 hour \nsupport \naverage per week.\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n              \nFrom 1/4/14, 7 hostel units will be leased to a Supporting People funded scheme for 16/17 year olds and care leavers. This partner\nship approach will address a strategic gap in accommodation with support provision for Gosport, our neighbouring Fareham Borough Council and Hampshire County Council Children’s Services. Both Hampshire Children’s Services and Hampshire Supporting People ar\ne funding this \nnew service. The existing newly developed hostel (Agnew) is the only building where this young person\n’\ns scheme could be delivered due to the existing supervision of that building. This new scheme has been a strategic priority since at least \n2003.\n&#xa0;\n2.5\n              \nA further relevant fact is that 40 hostel units are \ncurrently \noccupied by residents with an assessed need for move on to supported accommodation\n.\n \nThe customer base of the Council owned hostels is in many ways no different from the customer base of the supported hostels in the district run by housing associations and voluntary agencies who would fall under the exempt hostel definition. The exclusion \nof the Council owned and managed hostels there\nfore \nappears both arbitrary and unfair. It could also undermine this districts strategic need to supplement Supporting People / other funded services by providing an emergency holding hostel pending vacancies a\nt these other hostels\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.6\n              \nBoth the young person’s scheme outlined in 1.4 and the Council’s statutory homeless provision aim to:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Governments HRA reform was intended to enable Council’s to develop accommodation and manage it. This has been achieved with the Councils current hostel strategy.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.0              Universal credit Implications&#xa0;3\n.1\n              \nA review of the Business Plans for the Council hostels has been undertaken and approved. There are some significant budgetary implications if the current definition of exempt accommodation remains. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nCurrent gross \noccupation charges are around the £200 per week level. Upon migration to UC the LHA level plus an unknown management fee will be claimable in subsidy. For all but the households with an assessed 4 bed need, the rent level that can be achieved is markedly b\nelow the £200 level. The following budget losses have been calculated and approved internally (these losses anticipate a management fee of (£40 per week).\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nThe projected total budget loss of £183,923 compares to a total budget of £127,420 for out of office hours security; or £105,228 hostel staff budget (Supporting People staff budget is separate); or capital repayment \ncosts of nearly £158,000. As you can see, none of these budget areas can fully cover the projected budget loss. None of those budget areas could be tampered with without making the hostel unviable.\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n              \nThe above losses relate to the HRA hostels not being \nexempt accommodation. In addition, rent award will be paid to claimants. Award may be paid to landlord after 4 weeks arrears and will after 8 weeks arrears. Although more difficult to project, budget losses could easily amount to a further £100,000. \n&#xa0;\n3.5\n              \nGosport Council’s temporary accommodation strategy places high importance to the Councils role in managing statutory homeless\n. One response to the changes upon migration to UC would be to try to get a housing association etcetera to take over the hostels. \nEven if that were possible it would be an unwelcome forced change. That change also appears to be in opposition to the Governments strategy of enabling council’s (through HRA reform) to meet the challenges faced by them.  \n&#xa0;\n27 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
