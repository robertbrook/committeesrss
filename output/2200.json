"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Bournemouth University (WSC096)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLike many universities,\n Bournemouth University \n(BU) \nfaces significant challenges\n \nattracting and \nretaining women in academic careers\n, particularly in STEM subjects\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn\n 2009\n we had \nonly \nfour female \nP\nrofessors\n, and \nwe have been urgently working to address this\n. \nBetween 2009 and 2012 the number of \nfemale\n Professors at \nBU\n increased from four to nine, or a fifth of all Professors. Although there is still a long way to go, with the help of initiatives \nlike those outlined in this submission \nwe have been able to make sustained progress.\n \nOverall \nBU\n now employs 309 \nfemale\n academ\nics to 342 male academics, another positive sign that the ratio of \nfemale\n Professors will improve in the coming years as more junior academics’ careers progress.\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBU has learnt important l\nessons from this \nexperience, \nwhich\n we believe\n can be applied to othe\nr instituti\nons starting \nwith \nlow base\n numbers\n \nof female academics.\n The i\nssues \nand challenges that we have encountered \nextend beyond STEM subjects \nand \nare \ndirectly\n applicable to many different subject areas. \nInterestingly, not all \nof the \nchallenges are rest\nricted to women either.\n&#xa0;\n1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are no simple answers to the questions raised by this inquiry\n, rather many different issues \nthat wome\nn in academia encounter, which \nwhen \ncombined compound the problem of under\n representation of wome\nn in STEM.\n \nWe have not \nattempted to provide an exhaustive sum\nmary of all the\n issues \nin this submission\n (which will vary by institution and according to different women’s experience). Instead we have \nnoted\n the problems which were frequently raised in discussions with women \nin aca\ndemia \nat \nBU.\n \n&#xa0;\n1.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSome of the problems and barriers encountered are practical whereas others are cultural, although there is \nfrequent\n cross-over and often no clear distinction between the two. \n&#xa0;\n1.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt \nis\n apparent that some of the evidence of cultural problems within academia is\n,\n by its \nvery \nnature\n, more anecdotal and qualitative. However, \ngiven the frequency with which such points were raised we think it\n is\n imp\nortant that it be\n taken into account.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSeveral women \nreported\n feeling that \nthe academic culture i\ns \nnot conducive\n to raising a family\n. W\nomen \nperceived that they were \nexpected to dedicate their liv\nes to academia \nin order \nto be successful, and \nthat \na decision to have children \nwas\n seen as an admission\n that they we\nre not serious about their careers.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA key issue underpinning this problem is the difficulty \nthat \nSTEM \nacademics face when contemplating a l\nonger \nperiod of leave – \nnaturally\n \nneeded\n for women starting a family. They believe that they run\n the risk of missing \nkey \ndevelopments in\n such\n rapidly changing research areas and institutions.\n \nIn\n other\n careers it can be much easier to take \nmaternity leave \nand time\n off to care for children, \nbut \nfor women in academia there is never a good time to be out of their field.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn practical terms, statutory rates of maternity pay in academia are \nrelatively\n low, meaning women taking time off to h\nave children face fina\nncial penal\nties\n. They also often feel that they have to c\nontinue \nworking\n while off campus\n, since it is impossible to bring in a direct replacement in their area of \nresearch \nspecialism and expertise\n.\n This can create a very frustrating compromise situation, \nwhere women typically continue working \nwhile on maternity leave, \nbut \nstill feel that the\nir careers are set back by taking time off, as they inevitably publish less and \nrisk \nmi\nss\ning\n key developments in their field.\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWomen\n in academia\n can \nalso f\nind the retur\nn to work and \nthe year immediately following maternity leave\n particularly challenging. They may not receive any\n additional administrative support or r\neduction in \nteaching \nworkload, \nbut still have to catch up on research\n work afte\nr a year’s absence while\n, o\nf course, continuing to care\n for \ntheir \nchildren.\n&#xa0;\n2.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs one academic\n succinctly\n puts it\n,\n \n‘The bottom-line is that academia does not currently\n&#xa0;\nmake it easy in any way for women to retain their research ca\nreers when they have children.\n&#xa0;\nAcademia is highly competitive, and it is very difficult for women to keep their careers on a par with men \nif they wish to have children.\n&#xa0;\nIt's easier not to bother trying’.\n&#xa0;\n2.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs well as issues with caring for children, balancing academic careers with \npartne\nrs\n’ careers\n can \nalso cause difficulties for wome\nn in academia.\n \nA\n partner\n’s \nnon-academic \ncareer\n \ncan \noften \nbe prioritised, being more likely to provide\n a \npermanent rather than \nfixed term contract and \ntherefore \nmo\nre stability\n. \nIf the ‘non-academic partner’ moves to take up another role it can often be \nin \nan area where the woman cannot find a suitable academic position.\n&#xa0;\n2.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWomen in \nrelationship\ns with \nother acade\nmic\ns may not be immune to this. A\nlthough such a relationship could be t\nhought to work well in terms of balancing a career, a woman with a partner who is a\nt a\n more senior academic \nlevel to herself \nmay find herself disadvantaged if they have to relocate to another university\n. \nThe situation essentially becomes a self-fulfilling \nprophecy.\n&#xa0;\n2.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA\nnother\n fundamental issue affecting retention of women in STEM subjects is the poor availability of \npermanent\n contracts in academia. \nGenerally, it takes slightly longer in academia to reach the experience level appropriate for permanent posts, and unfortunately this tends to coincide with the time at which people are seeking to purchase houses and/or start a family. Consequently many wo\nmen \nleave academia, or never enter it in the first place, in favour of more stable careers.\n&#xa0;\n2.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDue in part to these \nchallenges\n, culturally\n there is a shortage of\n female\n role models in many universities,\n with few (or no) \nwomen visibly holding senior academic positions. \nThis\n can in turn affect the confidence and ambition of other wo\nmen as well as affecting the \navailability of female mentors.\n&#xa0;\n2.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA lack of women in\n senior positions can also \naffect recruitment and lead to a soli\ndifying of the status\n quo, as senior male academics (consciously or subconsciously)\n recruit colleagues and successors in their own image\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn addition \nto recruitment panels potentially tending to\n recruit in their own likeness, \nresearch\n \nhas shown that ther\ne can often be an ‘un\nconscious bias’\n against women.\n \nFor example, in\n terms of applications for jobs and p\nromotion, when CVs are judged blindly \nwomen fare better on average, but when names are included, men\n have the advantage\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSome women also describe \nencountering ‘anti-role models’\n (one \nacademic described\n them as\n ‘Margaret Thatcher\n’ characters\n)\n,\n who after rising through the ranks\n \nthemselves \ndo not necessarily promote or encourage other women, and do not see the n\need for a wider gender balance \nother\n tha\nn themselves as a lone figure at the top.\n&#xa0;\n2.13\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOne academic writes \n“There are also women that use their single or childless status to their advant\nage.\n \nF\nor example one candidate seeking a Chair stating that ‘Well, I’m gay – so you don’t have to worry about me g\noing off to have children’. Not strictly true, but she got the post.”\n&#xa0;\n2.14\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFemale academics\n have also reported experiencing harassment\n or\n,\n more frequently\n,\n \nan underlying prejudice\n on account of their \ngender, which \nobvious\nly has a\n negative\n \neffect\n on\n morale and the retention of female academics.\n \nSome women recount\n being viewed as automatically less capable than male colleagues, less interested in promotion, and potentially distracted from their careers by \ntheir \ndecisions to have children.\n&#xa0;\n2.15\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOne academi\nc writes that while no-one would openly admit to ho\nlding or expressing such views,\n \n“\nEqually no-one\n \nwants to speak out about the daily issues they have encountered in the fear of having their name blackened or career slighted. Academia is a small world, dep\nendent on your reputation and personal networks, so a small amount of negativity can have a huge\n impact on your personal career”\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.16\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAt a cul\ntural level many women also encounter\n ‘macho practices’ within male-dominated disc\niplines such as STEM, sometimes \nhaving to be highly assertive to ensure they receive credit for their work, such as\n inclusion of\n their names on research papers co-\nauthored\n with male colleagues.\n \nOne academic comments\n,\n \n‘Quite simply, many women do not feel this is a modus operandi they can\n tolerate, let alone flourish in’.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe wome\nn\n that BU\n consulted\n \nfor this inquiry were obviously all still within academia, and many\n still\n within STEM subjects. They were therefore unable to comment personally on reasons for leaving academia, but many reported friends and colleagues’ experiences. \n&#xa0;\n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAnecdotally, it appears that most women who leave \nSTEM subjects \ndo so \nin favour of working in business.\n \nThis is partly attributed to companies in the private sector being able to offer more appealing maternity leave and childcare benefits than universities\n, along with more competitive salaries.\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSome women also move into management schemes for large private companies after completing PhDs in STEM subjects, which not only draws them away from academic careers, but can also be count\nerintuitive \nas these are of\nten careers\n they could have followed \nafter \nan undergraduate degree, without needing a Doctorate to qualify.\n&#xa0;\n5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPreparing this submission has been an interesting exercise for BU, and we are extremely grateful to everyone who gave up their time to put forward comments and experiences. We strongly believe in the value of diversity and the p\nositive effect that it has on our ability to be creative and innovative. We also feel very strongly that it is completely unacceptable for anyone to feel harassed or subject to underlying prejudice. \n&#xa0;\n5.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs a result of this submission, we will be recommending\n a review of BU’s maternity policy and the support we provide to colleagues on their return to work. We will also recommend that BU explores possible actions to bring about a cultural change in attitude towards women in \nacademia, including how we can bette\nr celebrate those who successfully combine their career with family commitments.\n&#xa0;\n5.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, it is important to note that BU academics were recounting their experiences from across their entire career span, and that significant progress on supporting women \nin academia has been made over the last few years.\n&#xa0;\n5.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA \nu\nniversity-wide Women’s \nAcademic Network \n(WAN) \nhas been established, with support from the highest level being provided as a key institutional priority.\n \nSuch networks can serve multi-faceted purposes; r\naising the profile of existing women academics across the University, serving as networking forums allowing women\n in academia to meet regularly (\nincluding \nvia social events),\n and arranging \nevents\n with high-profile, inspirational speakers.\n&#xa0;\n5.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAt \nBU\n \nthe Networ\nk\n also provides a means by which the University can identify the\n important issues affecting wome\nn academic\ns, crowd-source potential remedies, and maintain a direct dialogue with women over whether \nintroduced \nmeasur\nes are having a positive effect\n.\n \nWe\n would highly recommend the establishment of such a network\n to all universities\n, \npreferably \nbuilt into the \ninstitution’s formal structures.\n&#xa0;\n5.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs an\n institution we have also signe\nd up to the Athena SWAN\n Charter -\n a national initiative which recognises and celebrates good pract\nice in maintaining and promoting wome\nn academics in STEM subjects. \nAlong with many other universities we are also taking part in th\ne Athena Swan Awards, which are\n proving a rigorous, external\nly verified means of monitoring and celebrating our progress in this area.\n \nWe strongly recommend that all u\nniversities \nsign up to the Athena S\nWAN \ninitiative, and would suggest \nholding a week of events to promote the initiative internally.\n&#xa0;\n5.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBU\n has also intr\noduced an Associate Professor grade, a post in which holders are provi\nded with considerable advice and development opportunities to support them in pro\ngressing to full Professorships within three to five years.\n \nThere \nare currently eight wome\nn Associate \nProfessors\n,\n which gives us confidence \nthat \nwe can \nfurther \nsignificantly increase the number of \nfemale\n Professors at \nBU\n over the next few years.\n&#xa0;\n5.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are also other general measures \nthat\n women consulted at B\nU believe that universities across the UK\n could \ntake to improve the retention of women in STEM.\n For example:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlthough many universities have been making progress \non tackling the under-representation of women in STEM, there is clearly more that can be done, and given \nthat \nthey face a potential drain of talent from academia, universities need to be more proactive in combatting this \n- \nboth for the sake of equality, \nan\nd\n for their own institutional \neffectiveness.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe\n \ninitial \nonus to provide more sustainable, \npermanent \ncontr\nacts for academics is \non \nuniversities\n. However\n, Government also has an important role in securing these \nby\n recognising the importance of protecting research a\nnd development funding for STEM, both through the\n UK Treasury and from international sources, particularly the European Com\nmission. \n&#xa0;\n6.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOne suggestion \nis that the Government should set national targets for the number of men in s\nenior roles in Higher Education.\n A target of, for example, no more than 60% of roles in university leadership \nteams being held by men by 2020\n wo\nuld give \na strong message, and c\no\nuld also be a \nless contentious approach than\n the\n introduction of quotas for women.\n&#xa0;\n6.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAt a national level, the Government could also set targets \nto ensure that\n all funding bodies m\naking decisions about awards \nhave an equal \nnumber of \nmen and women on the\nir decision-\nmaking panels.\n&#xa0;\n6.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe next Research Excellence\n Framework process, scheduled for 2018, could also monitor gender equality \namongst researchers, and potentially make the availability of schemes such as mentoring of women in STEM,\n and participation in national \ninitiatives\n such as the Athena SWAN\n Awards, conditions of funding.\n&#xa0;\n6.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGovernment can also play a role in working with Universities UK and other scientific bodies to promote success stories of women in STEM nationally, ensuring \nMinisters frequently celebrate particular case studies and best practice.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis\n \ninquiry by the \nScience and Technology Select Committee into the issue of women in STEM subjects is to be welcomed as an initial step \ntowards evaluating the extent o\nf the problem, and concentrating minds natio\nnally on \npossible solutions\n. \nWe hope\n that the Government will serious\nly consider any collective\n recommendations made, and that the Committee will continue to return to the issue and monitor progress.\n&#xa0;\n7.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBournemouth\n University\n would be delighted to give oral evidence on these issues as part of the Select Committee inquiry, if required.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/features/why-are-there-so-few-female-vice-chancellors/2006576.article\n \n Dr. Heather Savigny, \nSenior Lecturer in Politics at Bournemouth University has written a paper, ‘Women Know your Limits; Cultural Sexism in Academia’ currently under peer review prior to publication, examining this issue.\n"
