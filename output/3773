defaultAt the oral evidence session I said that it was difficult to know what could be saved without knowing what the starting point was.

defaultLocal Government external spend in 2011/12 was £58 billion (the number quoted by DCLG sourced from their publication “Local Government Financial Statistics England #23 2013”
default&#xa0;
defaultOf this sum £15.8billion was classified as “Education”. Most of this expense is directly controlled by schools themselves and will have little or no impact on local authority finances.
default&#xa0;
defaultThat leaves £42.2 billion. Spending reductions during this parliament will reduce this expense considerably and if it was to be reduced by

default&#xa0;
defaultThere is an additional capital spend of £20 billion, mainly on construction. The priority for savings for councils must be revenue spending rather than capital to maximise the impact on services, council tax payers and employment.

This system provides an analysis of spend by category which could be a useful basis for understanding local authority procurement spend as a whole and then the potential for savings.

defaultConstruction
defaultIf 14% could be saved as suggested by SCAPE that would deliver £1.2bn nationally but I would query the validity of the 
defaultScape
default savings estimates. It is very difficult to validate savings on construction projects as each is different. Savings 
defaultmethodologies themselves differ in this sector. The average covers the wider public sector not just Local Authorities. Projects are unique and depend on funding so a saving in one year will not be repeated in the next. The profile of construction spend in the North east is very much more towards many low value projects where savings will be difficult to achieve rather than the kind of major projects SCAPE are involved with. In any case savings in construction affect capital budgets rather than revenue and will have no impact on council running costs.

defaultThe rest
defaultA very wide range of products and services including professional services, ICT, facilities management, and 
defaultenvironmental services may then be capable of further procurement improvement. That would be about half of £29.5 billion revenue spend i.e. £14.7 billion.

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe written and oral evidence submitted to the committee has demonstrated that savings though procurement are already being achieved. This makes further incremental savings in areas such as vehicles, waste, catering, stationery which have been a focus for procurement (including collaborative procurement) for years, much more difficult to achieve. In the North East at least 40% of our spend is with small and medium sized enterprises and the third sector indicating that spend is spread thinly across many suppliers and any significant aggregation into larger contracts would be very difficult for local businesses.
default&#xa0;
defaultSavings potential varies considerably across categories and even by contract
default making a blanket percentage difficult to arrive at
default. Councils need to make cashable savings which have a direct impact on reducing budgets which further reduces the potential when price and other savings may only help to get close to an already reduced budget. If we take a reasonable target of 5%
default of £14.7 billion
default that could deliver £
default0.74 billion
default.
default Capital savings of 9% on larger projects (half the total spend) could deliver non cashable benefits of £0.9 billion. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThese numbers ar
defaulte therefore substantial but can
defaultnot be paraphrased as “billions” of potential savings.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe councils in the North East have already used their procurement teams to deliver these level of savings to contribute to overall existing budget reductions and any further inroads that might be made will surely only contribute towards 
defaulthelping to survive 
defaultdeeper cuts rather than taking more money out of the system.
