default&#xa0;defaultIntroductiondefault&#xa0;default     
default 
defaultInvestment in infrastructure to support UK economic 
defaultgrowth is essential and business investor confidence that can be placed in the delivery of that infrastructure 
defaultis 
defaultvital. Uncertainty in this regard 
defaultcould 
defaultplace the UK at a competitive disadvantage in global markets.
default&#xa0;
default     
default 
defaultClarity and certainty on the timi
defaultng of infrastructure investment comes less from change in the decision making process itself, but from having a clear vision of the strategic priorities for the UK.  The identification of those strategic infrastructure priorities has to be driven by an und
defaulterstanding of the key spatial priorities for the UK economy.
default&#xa0;
default   
default 
defaultProgress with the preparation of the National Policy Statement on National Networks is therefore welcomed by the CIHT, providing the potential opportunity to set out a clear long-term framew
defaultork for the development of the country’s transport infrastructure.  However, it is essential that such a policy statement sits within a broader spatial strategy for the country, including, housing, jobs
default, environment
default and infrastructure. One that takes accou
defaultnt of, and builds upon, the economic strengths and potential of key sub-national areas.
default  CIHT will be responding to the government’s consultation in due course.
default&#xa0;
default Such a framework at the national level would provide a clear strategic framework within which
default detailed proposals could be developed by partners at the local level: for the purposes of this submission the argument assumes that the most appropriate ‘local level’ is the functional economic area.
default&#xa0;
default Such considerations become all the more pertinent with the establishment of the Local Growth Fund.  Lord Heseltine’s report ‘No Stone Unturned’ identified the critical importance for the UK to target investment in infrastructure to support economic growth
default and the need to prioritise that investment if the UK economy is to be globally competitive.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ1. default              defaultWhat is the rationale for the Government’s proposals to devolve to a local decision making on transport expenditure?  What are the advantages and disadvantagdefaultes of the Government’s approach?  Are there better models?default&#xa0;
default1.1default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe government’s proposals to devolve decision making on expenditure ultimately fits in with their localism agenda – devolving power and responsibility from a national to local level.
default&#xa0;
default1.2default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe over-ri
defaultding consideration for any decision making process is the need to ensure the timely and efficient delivery of the outcomes being sought.
default&#xa0;
default1.3default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe timescales associated with the identification, development and subsequent implementation of major transport scheme
defaults are lengthy: a factor that needs to be taken into account whenever reviewing the need for change to the decision making process for prioritising and allocating funding.
default&#xa0;
default1.4default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWithin the last five years the decision making process for allocating funds to inves
defaultt in transport infrastructure has undergone repeated and fundamental change – from the prioritisation of schemes on a regional/sub national basis, to centralised decision making, to devolution to Local Transport Boards and now to non-statutory partnerships
default led by the Local Enterprise Partnerships working in partnership with local authorities and other partners.
default&#xa0;
default1.5default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChange to the decision making process is in itself not inherently a bad thing.  However, 
defaultit needs to be remembered that
default any change temporarily adds
default inertia to the delivery process.  The 
defaultChartered Institution of Highways and Transportation (CIHT) is of the view that the 
defaultprofession’s collective ability to improve the efficiency and speed of delivery of infrastructure is inextricably linked to the extent to which there is a degree of 
defaultcontinuity
default and certainty
default in the 
defaultbasis of the 
defaultdecision making process.
default  The creation of the 
defaultSingle Local Growth Fund should assist with certainty of the funding stream.
default&#xa0;
default1.6default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDevolution of decision making to the local level has been accompanied by a simplified approach to planning policy.  Whilst the introduction of the National Planning Policy Framew
defaultork has simplified the overarching policy framework, there remains an expectation within the profession, as to the need to retain and reference technical guidance and/or advice.
default&#xa0;
default1.default7default   
defaultThe establishment of Local Enterprise Partnerships
default (LEPs)
default, followed by 
defaultthe opportunity for local partners to work on the development of City-Deal proposals, and now the prospect of Growth Deals, have led to the development of stronger working relationships between public sector organisations, the business community and academ
defaultia.
default  There remains a need to ensure the same level of duty to 
defaultcooperate (
defaultconsider neighbouring authorities
default)
default applies to LEPs and Planning Authorities as the Traffic Management Act places on Local Highway Authorities to address cross boundary concerns
default&#xa0;
default1.8default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSuch initiatives 
defaultcan
default encourage the development of a single narrative for a functional economic area – 
defaultpotentially 
defaultenabl
defaulting
default local partners to better articulate the inter-relationship between investment in transport infrastructure, 
defaultenvironment, 
defaulthousing and skills in support of economic growth across their area.  
defaultWhilst agreeing with the government’s move towards devolution, there is a danger that local response
default 
defaultcould be very local and not joined up, leading to inconsistencies.
default 
default  
default1.9default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLocal partners 
defaultshould be allowed to build upon this by continuing to be allowed to develop bespoke governance and working arrangements for their area that best reflect their local circumstances.  However, it is accepted that the governance and working arrangements should
default be subject to the approval of Government: to ensure that devolution of funding (with the potential for being held accountable to Parliament) is vested in an appropriately constituted set up.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ2default              defaultDo local bodies (including local authorities, local enterpridefaultse partnerships, passenger transport executives, integrated transport authorities and local transport boards) have the capacity to assess, prioritise and deliver local transport schemes?  What would the optimum delivery body look like?default&#xa0;
default2.1default  
defaultIt is difficul
defaultt to make a complete assessment 
defaultof the new arrangements as not 
defaultenough time has yet passed to make a proper evaluation. Some 
defaultlocal bodies
default are also further ahead and working more effectively than others.
default&#xa0;
default2.2default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe CIHT argues that a discussion on the governance and working arrangements at the local level should differentiate between the forum in which decisions on investment priorities are made and the arrangements in place to deliver that investment on the grou
defaultnd.  
default&#xa0;
default2.3default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe previous attempt to devolve decision making on the allocation of investment in major transport schemes – through the process of Regiona
defaultl Funding Allocations – enabled
default 
defaultlocal 
defaultdecision makers to use their knowledge to prioritise the available trans
defaultport funding 
defaultand to 
defaultco-ordinate
default that investment with the funds available for 
defaulthousing and economic development.
default&#xa0;
default2.4default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultCIHT argues that the 
defaultimportance of adopting a co-ordinated approach r
defaulte
defaultmains as valid today as it did then – travel is a derived demand.
default&#xa0;
default2.5default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA k
defaultey issue that needs consideration as part of this Inquiry is that of the av
defaulta
defaultilability of the technical and political skills required to enable the decision making process to operate efficiently.  Local 
defaultHighway
default Authorities continue to be the main repository
default for these skills within the local area.  It is therefore unsurprising that many Local Enterprise Partnerships look to their Local
default 
defaultHighway
default Authorities to provide the technical support on transport related matters.  
default&#xa0;
default2.6default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe CIHT
default argues that the role of Local Highway
default Authorities
default and Integrated Transport Authorities
default in this regard should be acknowledged more explicitly across Government.  
default&#xa0;
default2.7default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn the absence of such acknowledgement, a consequence of the on-going financial pressures wi
defaultthin the public sector is the 
defaultloss of existing 
defaultskills
default.  This remove
defaults
default capacity and capability within the authorities at the very time when there is an increased need for the public sector to provide strong leadership in the development and delivery of major transport schemes.  An added threat to the skills base is the contr
defaultaction in size and scope of local authority activities.  Change of this type reduces the opportunities and capacity of local authorities to train and develop the skills required to maintain the skills base in the longer term.
default&#xa0;
default2.8default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs is the case with many othe
defaultr professions, that of transport planning faces the challenges of an aging demographic.  As a professional body the CIHT is actively supporting the development of appropriate skills within the existing workforce as well as encouraging future generations to
default enter the profession.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ3default              defaultWhat is the best way of dealing with major transport schemes that cross local authority boundaries or have wider regional impact?default&#xa0;
default3.1default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA ‘light touch’ 
defaultnational
default 
defaultspatial strategy, supported by a National Policy Statement on National Ne
defaulttworks, 
defaultwould provide such co-ordinated approach at the national level.  Th
defaulte CIHT argues that this 
defaultwould have two immediate benefits.  Firstly it would reinforce the need for increased cross-Departmental working within Whitehall
default, in the process supporting 
defaultthe establishment of 
defaultthe Local Growth Fund.  Secondly, it would provide local partners with a clear context within which to develop their local proposals
default: proposals that reflect local priorities and which are outcome focused.
default&#xa0;
default3.2default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe issue of transport scheme
defaults that cross local authority boundaries has to be considered in the context of the issues that each scheme might raise.  Where a cross 
defaultboundary scheme is of national significance in its own right, or forms part of a wider corridor approach that is of natio
defaultnal significance, it would seem appropriate for that to be reflected in the national framework.
default&#xa0;
default3.3default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe key consideration for any potential scheme (not just ones that are cross boundary) must be an understanding of the outcome it delivers and how that relates
default to the agreed outcomes for the relevant functional economic area.   By focusing on the delivery of outcomes, schemes that cross local authority boundaries should not be disadvantaged.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ4default              defaultHow effectively do local bodies work with each other and with Goverdefaultnment departments and national transport agencies?default&#xa0;
default4.default1default              
defaultI
defaultn a recent workshop hosted by CIHT on behalf of the DfT and HA and including Local Authorities and 
defaultLE
defaultPs it became clear that there were
default 
defaultsome 
defaultgood
default or 
defaultimproving
default working practice
defaults
default between
default Local Authorities and the Highways Agency.
default&#xa0;
default4.default2default              
defaultIt is important that this relationship is maintained and improved upon once the
default Highways Agency becomes a GoCo
default, ensuring that a duty to cooperate and the economic growth agenda are covered by any new holistic performance specification. 
default&#xa0;
default4.3default 
default              
defaultImproved certainty of funding for the newly formed Highways Agency should assist local areas better understand, inform and 
defaultrespond to the Agency’s plans.
default It should also improve local networks to meet the wider economic growth agenda.
default&#xa0;
default4.4default   
defaultThe Agency should also have a better understanding on how it can and should involve local bodies.   Customers view the highway network as 
defaulta whole and local bodies
default,
default the HA and other stakeholders need to recognise this.
default&#xa0;
default4.5default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMany authorities are taking some if not all of the standard methodologies developed by the Highways Maintenance Efficiency Programme 
default(HMEP),
default a sector led, DfT sponsored programme.  This is a positive trend and should be encouraged by all.
default&#xa0;
default4.6default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is also important for the DfT to ensure that other government departments recognise the cross-cutting nature of transport and the cros
defaults-sector benefits that can result from transport investment (e.g. health, climate change, education, air quality and access to key services).
default&#xa0;
default4.7default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhilst the establishment of LEPs has led to stronger working relationships between public and private sectors 
defaultthere remains further room for improved and more effective working. 
default&#xa0;
default4.8default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt will be essential that there is coordination and cooperation between local bodies.  Whilst there are some very good examples 
defaultof good local working practices, there is a danger of unev
defaulten development and funding which could lead to inconsistencies. There can also be different skills levels and types between areas.  A higher skill level would be seen as a huge advantage to an areas ability to attract investors.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ5default              defaultDo the current funding defaultstreams for major local transport schemes meet the needs of local authorities?  How do current funding streams compare with previous arrangements?default&#xa0;
default5.1default   
defaultOne aspect of private sector funding for transport that gives cause for concern is that secured throug
defaulth the planning system.  Whilst experience with the Community Infrastructure Levy is limited to date, there is a growing concern that the opportunity to 
defaultsecure an appropriate contribution towards transport infrastructure through the planning system is becom
defaulting more difficult.
default&#xa0;
default5.2default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis concern is compounded by the fact that up to 25% of Community Infrastructure Levy monies secured will be directed in accordance with the priorities identified by neighbourhood communities.
default&#xa0;
default5.3default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is an inherent inflexibility 
defaultpresent within the Community Infrastructure Levy when compared with the previous S106 regime.  In the latter the need to secure an appropriate contribution towards transport infrastructure could be driven back into the land value if necessary.  That flexib
defaultility is lost as a result of the introduction of the Community Infrastructure Levy.
default&#xa0;
default5.4default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFailure to address the challenges associated with securing appropriate contributions for transport infrastructure through the planning system will inevitably increase the 
defaultpressure on other funding sources.
default&#xa0;
default5.5default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA move from grants to competitive bidding rounds for pots of funding could be a drain on already scare resources
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultQ6 default              defaultWhat impact will the devolution in 2015 of funding to Local Transport Bodies and the Single Local defaultGrowth Fund have?default&#xa0;
default6.1default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDevolution of decision making on funding must be accompanied by extending the scope for local partners to determine the basis on which their
default local priorities are arrived at
default.  Variations in approach to reflect local circumstances should b
defaulte encouraged, confident in the fact that the national spatial strategy provides 
defaultan 
defaultappropriate strategic context.
default&#xa0;
default6.2default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe closer one can align policy making with responsibility for the allocation of funds, the 
defaultgreater the opportunity to improve the efficiency
default and timeliness of the 
defaultdecision making process.
default&#xa0;
default6.3default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is essential that the local governance and working arrangements associated with the devolution of decision making and funding reflect the views of the public sector organisations, the business community a
defaultnd academia.  It is particularly important that the views of one sector do not dominant.  
default&#xa0;
default6.4default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is essential that the allocation of funds from the 
defaultSingle 
defaultLocal Growth Fund is not overly focused on investment in new infrastructure to unlock development oppor
defaulttunities.  Public sector organisations, and in particular the Local Transport Authorities, will be keen to ensure that significant investment continues to be made in maintaining the existing transport infrastructure.  The CIHT has consistently argued the c
defaultase for investment in maintenance of the existing asset as being of equal, if not greater, significance when it comes to supporting economic growth in the round.
default 
default&#xa0;
default6.5default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is a danger that the 
defaultdelivery could be fragmented and lack overall cohesion
default which coul
defaultd lead to inefficiencies of scale.  As mentioned in 4.5 the use of HMEP, encouraging sharing of learning/best practices and set ways of operating will help to drive efficiencies into delivery at a local level.
default&#xa0;
default6.default6default              
defaultB
defaultetter forward visibility of public 
defaultsector funding (
defaulti.e
default.
default five years plus) would enable local bodies to better develop a clear strategy and provisional programme and therefore lever private sector contributions and other joint funding to deliver a more secure programme of infrastructure schem
defaultes.
default&#xa0;
default6.7default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFlexibility of Strategic public sector funding to enable more contributions to schemes that are not on the strategic network but contribute to strategic objectives
default&#xa0;
defaultQ7.default              defaultHow can local authorities attract greater investment from the private sector for defaultthe delivery and maintenance of local transport infrastructure?  What scope is there for the use of alternative funding schemes?default&#xa0;
default7.1default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMany Local Transport Authorities have established long-term contractual arrangements with private sector delivery partners who
default support them in fulfilling their statutory duties.  Increasingly Local Transport Authorities are exploring with these partners the opportunity to develop more innovative approaches to financing the delivery of major transport schemes.  
default&#xa0;
default7.2default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe opportunity f
defaultor local partners to leverage in additional funding (as opposed to financing delivery of schemes with funding already secured) is again something that Local Transport Authorities are exploring.  The covenant of local authorities in the UK remains very attr
defaultactive to institutional investors.  Government support for innovative solutions led by Local Transport Authorities may enable additional funding to be leveraged more cost effectively than if led by the private sector.  
default&#xa0;
default7.3default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSuch an approach could be seen as r
defaulteinforcing the devolution of decision making and funding to local partnerships.  It could also be used to reinforce other Government initiatives designed to increase the extent to which funding raised locally is retained within the local economy.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ8default              defaultHow cdefaultlear are the lines of accountability for local decision making on transport expenditure?default&#xa0;
default8.1default 
default 
defaultThe lines of accountability are unclear.
default  CIHT believes that LTBs, LEPs should be democratically accountable and representative, it is essential that the develop
defaultment of local scheme priorities fits with existing statutory plans.
default Elected members from district councils and, in the metropolitan areas, the Integrated Transport Authorities, should have a clear and prominent role in the process.
default&#xa0;
default8.2default 
default 
defaultIn
default our view, encouragement should be given for membership of the LTBs to be extended to other bodies, as relevant, including the Highways Agency, Network Rail, local Chambers of Commerce, key transport operators, and representative bodies in relation to publ
defaultic transport 
default&#xa0;
defaultConclusiondefault              
defaultThe approach set out in this submission to 
defaultestablishing the local governance and working arrangements, if 
defaultsupported 
defaultby Government 
defaultthrough the publication of a ‘light-touch’ 
defaultnational spatial strategy would provide clarity 
defaultin terms of 
defaultthe lines of accountability for local decision making on transport expenditure.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe CIHT argues that clarity and stability in the decision making process is essential in order to provide certainty for scheme promoters to invest staff time and 
defaultvaluable revenue funding in the development of proposals.  It is also essential in order to provide confidence to business investors who are looking for a modern and efficient transport system to support economic growth.
default&#xa0;
defaultConstant change to the decision ma
defaultking process in recent years has 
defaultnot given scheme promoters and their delivery partners the confidence to 
defaultmake the 
defaultinvest
defaultment in scheme 
defaultdevelopment that would enable th
defaulte 
defaultrequired 
defaultlong-term investment programme 
defaultfor 
defaultUK 
defaultto come forward
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultAs a consequence, w
defaulthen opportunities to secure funding from Government have arisen so the likelihood 
defaultincreases that 
defaultsome of that funding 
defaultis 
defaultallocated to opportunistic schemes simply because they are ready
default.  The existence of an agreed programme of investment determined locall
defaulty within the framework provided by a national spatial strategy would help ensure that the funds available are allocated to the most appropriate schemes.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultCIHT submit that the 
defaultintroduction of the 
defaultSingle 
defaultLocal Growth Fund affords the opportunity to devel
defaultop a truly devolved decision making and funding arrangement.  However, in order to ensure that such an approach is efficient and delivers timely investment it is important that Government provides a ‘light touch’ national spatial strategy: one that is supp
defaultorted by appropriate national policy statements.
