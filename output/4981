[normal]Written evidence submitted by The Haemophilia Society (BTO0009)[bold]Thank you for the invitation to respond to your 
[normal]inquiry on blood, tissue and organ screening. We understand that this follows on from an evidence session held on the subject of Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (
[normal]vCJD
[normal]).
[normal]The Haemophilia Society is the only UK wide independent organisation representing patients with inherited bleeding disorders. In response to the Select Committee’s call for written evidence, in consultation with our Clinical Advisory Group, led by Professor Michael 
[normal]Makris
[normal], 
[normal]Professor of 
[normal]Haemostasis
[normal] &amp; Thrombosis at the University of Sheffield, 
[normal]we offer the following:
[normal]Summary of evidence
[normal]1[bold] Following the contamination of whole blood and blood products in the 1970s and 1980s with the lethal viruses HIV and hepatitis C, the population of people with 
[normal]Haemophilia
[normal] and other bleeding disorders would look to the government and health service to take every reasonable precaution to 
[normal]minimise
[normal] risk. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This would include documenting a clear evidence base for decision making on who can donate blood, tissues, and organs, and publishing explanations for its decision making, to include a review of evidence and practice from other countries. 
[normal]2[bold] As a result of exposure to clotting factors made from UK human plasma 3,058 persons with inherited bleeding disorders (most of who suffer from haemophilia) are now considered to be at risk for 
[normal]vCJD
[normal] for public health purposes. 801 of these individuals have been treated with concentrates made from the plasma of persons who have subsequently died from 
[normal]vCJD
[normal].
[normal]3[bold] Since 2004 all patients with haemophilia have been treated with recombinant concentrates which do not use human plasma in the manufacturing process and do not have a risk of transfusion transmitted infections such as 
[normal]vCJD
[normal], HIV or hepatitis C.
[normal]4[bold] Cryoprecipitate is a blood product made from human plasma. Once a donor donates a unit of blood, it is made into red cells, fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate. None of these products undergo any viral inactivation in the UK. Cryoprecipitate is rich in a clotting factor called fibrinogen.
[normal]5[bold] When a patient requires fibrinogen replacement there are two ways of doing this:
[normal]6[bold] Fibrinogen replacement is required by patients with bleeding due to inherited as well as acquired deficiencies of fibrinogen. Acquired deficiencies of fibrinogen are seen in patients after major injuries such as road traffic accidents as well as when major bleeding occurs at the time of delivery of pregnancy. In the UK cryoprecipitate is the main product used in these circumstances and, since it is given as multiples of 10 units at a time, it is not unusual for a patient to be exposed to more than 30 donors in one day.
[normal]7[bold] Because of the risk of transfusion transmitted infection, all the transfusion centres in Europe except the UK have stopped making and providing cryoprecipitate. All European countries except the UK are now using exclusively fibrinogen concentrate which does not have the 
[normal]vCJD
[normal] risk.  It is ironic that the UK, the only country in Europe with a possible 
[normal]vCJD
[normal] risk, is the only one continuing to use cryoprecipitate, rather than use the safer alternative.
[normal]8[bold] The British Committee for Standards in Haematology has recommended that the UK should discontinue using cryoprecipitate and move to using fibrinogen concentrate which is considered as a safer alternative. The Haemophilia Society strongly supports this recommendation.
[normal]9[bold] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Additionally we ask the committee to consider that
[normal] the UK reviews
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]the
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]current state of testing for 
[normal]vCJD
[normal] and look at the costs and benefits of developing and implementing an effective test for 
[normal]vCJD
[normal] for blood donations and for individuals, taking into account the ethical and psychological impact of testing.
