default&#xa0;
defaultQ35 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Could I first of all say to the witnesses how grateful we are for you coming back, given the unexpected circumstances of last week
default?
default  
defaultParliament seems to be very busy at the moment
default.  
defaultWe also have a very contentious issue on the floor of the house
default.  
defaultThere may be some votes and there are procedural questions that we also will have to manoeuvre between
default.  
defaultI am going to start with the first question, to pick up where we left off, and this is addressed to all of you
default.  
defaultIn the case of 
defaultTest-
defaultAchats
default, did the applications of Articles 21 and 32 of the Charter, in your view, lead to an extension of the scope of EU law, given that an explicit derogation in the Directive was 
defaultdisapplied
default by the court
default?  
default&#xa0;
defaultProfessor Douglas-Scott:default I do not think it did, because the Directive itself quite clearly sets out a principle of non-discrimination between the sexes in Article 5(1)
default.  
defaultThe Directive sets out a very clear principle of sex equality
default.  
defaultOne of the reasons why the court annulled Article 2 was because they found there was a lack of coherence in a Directive that sets out quite clearly the requirement for non-discrimination but then goes on to insert an exemption clause, which seems to have an almost unlimited applicability
default.  
defaultThe fact that the Directive made references to the Charter in its preamble strengthens that point, because it showed the urge of the European institutions to respect the principle of equal treatment
default.  
defaultAn important factor here was a poorly drafted instrument that suffered from a fatal inconsistency
default.  
defaultProfessor Craig:default I agree with what my colleague said
default.  
defaultI do not think the result would have been any different whatsoever before the Charter from what it would have been after the Charter
default.  
defaultIn a sense, I do not believe that the Charter was instrumental in reaching a different conclusion from what otherwise would have been reached
default.  
defaultPrior to the Charter, the ECJ would have applied general principles of law and they would have reached exactly the same conclusion
default.  
defaultI do not, therefore, believe in that sense that the Charter has led to a different result from that which would have otherwise been reached
default.  
defaultDavid Anderson:default I agree with both my colleagues
default.  
defaultI do not think I can usefully add anything
default.  
defaultMartin Howe:default I firmly disagree with all of my colleagues on this point
default.  
defaultFirst of all, I do not think that internal inconsistency can be a sufficient basis of itself for knocking out derogation
default.  
defaultBy definition, derogation may well be inconsistent with the general scheme laid down in the Directive in that 
defaultit makes a carve
default-
defaultout
default from its general provisions
default.  
defaultI cannot see that itself, by any credible intellectual path, lead to the derogation being invalidated
default.  
defaultSecondly, I acknowledge that there was, before the Charter was given legal effect, the doctrine of principles of law common to the member states
default.  
defaultI do not agree that in the absence of the Charter that would have been a credible or sufficient basis for the European court to knock out the derogation, since if you look at the time of the adoption of the Directive at the laws of the various member states, many member states had systems where differential premiums could be charged on insurance between genders on a statistical basis
default.  
defaultIt seems to me to say that there is a credible basis in that there is a sort of European consensus that this must be treated as a form of sex discrimination would be wrong and probably unsustainable
default.  
defaultI do think that this is an instance where the Charter has resulted in a significant shifting of the goal posts
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ36 default&#xa0; 
defaultJacob Rees-Mogg: Is the reasoning of the Court of Justice in 
defaultFransson
default consistent 
default  
defaultwith Article 51(1) of the Charter?
default&#xa0;
defaultMartin Howe:default The court would argue that it is consistent with it, in that it is an interpretation of it that gives a very wide meaning to when member states are implementing Union law
default.  
defaultThe issue is this: European Union law harmonises the levels of certain taxes, specifically the quantum of VAT
default.  
defaultIt does not seek to harmonise the procedures that member states use for the collection of taxes, which remain a matter for national law
default.  
defaultThe reasoning of the European court in that case was, because some of the taxes that the tax system collects are harmonised, the procedures employed by the tax system become within 
defaultthe scope of the implementation of European Union law
default.  
defaultAgain, this lacks intellectual credibility and it is an example of the court expanding the scope of its jurisdiction, albeit in that case they decided it was not contrary to the Charter
default.  
defaultNonetheless, having rolled the log out with this very wide-ranging interpretation, they are now in a position to apply the Charter over a wider field in future cases
default.  
default 
defaultDavid Anderson:default I do not think the 
defaultFrannson
default case was in any way surprising
default.  
defaultIt is true that Article 51(1) says that the Charter applies to member states only when implementing Union law
default.  
defaultBut it was apparent right from the start, if one read the explanations, that phrase was to be understood as “in the scope of Union law”. In support of that, the explanations cited pre-Charter case law, for example the 
defaultERT
default case, on the scope of the general principle of fundamental rights, which did not only apply when member states were, strictly speaking, implementing, but applied also when they were derogating from or were otherwise within the scope of Union law
default.  
defaultBefore 
defaultFrannson
default, that was the line taken by the High Court in 
defaultZagorski
default and by the Supreme Court in Mr Howe’s Rugby Football Union case that he told us about last week
default.  
defaultTherefore, it seems to me very unsurprising that the 
defaultFrannson
default case came to the result that it did
default.  
defaultAs I mentioned in my written evidence, it is perhaps significant that, although some member states intervened in that case to oppose the reading that the court eventually came up with, the United Kingdom was not among them
default.  
defaultYou may or may not think that was wise, but in any event it does suggest that there was no great opposition to it
default.  
defaultAs Professor Craig says in his supplementary note, the reason why the court ruled as it did in 
defaultFrannson
default was because it took the view Swedish law was being used to implement the obligations flowing from a Directive and, therefore, the Article 51(1) test was satisfied
default.  
defaultHowever, in support of the case that I was putting last week—which is that there is as yet, at any rate, no sign of this court being rights crazed in its approach—I would refer to the conciliatory statement towards the end of the judgment saying that, where the court of a member state is called on to review whether fundamental rights are complied with by a national measure in a situation where the action of the member state is not entirely determined by EU law, the courts remain free to apply national standards of protection, so long as the level of protection provided for by the Charter is not compromised
default.  
defaultThat suggests to me, if one reads the tea leaves, possibly a divided judgment—a judgment in which there was anxious debate about what the result should be
default.  
defaultHowever, in any event, it was a cautious ruling, predicted in advance by the English courts, and it was a very long way from the much more radical idea that one saw suggested by the British Advocate General in the 
defaultRuiz-
defaultZambrano
default case
default.  
defaultProfessor Craig:default I agree with pretty much everything that David Anderson has just said
default.  
defaultI would add three points
default.  
defaultFirstly, I believe that the interpretation of member states implementing EU law in Article 51 to mean member states acting within the scope of EU law was the correct interpretation
default.  
defaultAny other interpretation would have led to formalistic distinctions and, moreover, the explanations had been there for over 10 years, making very clear that is what the EU and member states intended by the Charter
default.  
defaultThat is point one
default.  
defaultPoint two is that I do not believe, in this particular instance, that the application of the idea of member states acting within the scope of EU law was, in any sense, excessive
default.  
defaultI, with respect, differ from the opinion of the German Federal Constitutional Court, which regarded the 
defaultjudgment in this respect as excessive
default.  
defaultThe reason why I disagree is conceded by supplementary evidence and, to go to the heart of it, the point, as far as I can see, is this: the Court of Justice has made it clear in its early case law that the regime of VAT Directives imposes an obligation on member states to take all legislative and administrative measures appropriate for ensuring the collection of all VAT due on their territory
default.  
defaultThat obligation seems to me unexceptional and unarguable
default.  
defaultThe operative or determinative issue, therefore, is not whether the Swedish law in 
defaultAkerberg
default 
defaultFrannson
default was itself enacted to implement the VAT Directive, but whether it was being used to implement the obligations flowing from the Directive, which it clearly was
default.  
defaultThis was not, therefore, a case where someone was trying to tag on to European law through some incidental fact that was not really central to European law
default.  
defaultThe third point is that I would reiterate the point that David Anderson made: I do not think it was a divided court
default.  
defaultMy understanding is that the court very specifically made clear at the end of its judgment that, although this fell within the scope of EU law, the member states would be given some real latitude as to the meaning of fundamental rights as applicable in this case
default.  
defaultTherefore, the national conceptions of fundamental rights would be given all due weight
default.  
defaultFinally, as part of that third point, even if the ECJ does find that the national law is inconsistent with EU 
defaultlaw, that
default does not touch the ability of Sweden to have exactly the same tax enforcement regime in domestic law
default.  
defaultIt merely says that
default you cannot,
default insofar as you are using it to enforce this VAT Directive
default 
defaultProfessor Douglas-Scott:default You have heard very 
defaultfulsome
default answers from Professor Craig and David Anderson, and I do not have anything to add to what they have said
default.  
defaultI agree with both of them
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ37 default&#xa0; 
defaultJacob Rees-Mogg:default What nexus of EU law do you think is required post 
defaultFransson
default to trigger the application of the Charter in a member state
default?  
defaultLooking at VAT in the UK, the government collects over £100 billion a year but only 15% of it is our contribution to the EU
default.  
defaultIs it that a little leaven leavens all the bread
default?  
default&#xa0;
defaultProfessor Douglas-Scott:default It is difficult to put a precise amount on that
default.  
defaultThe Advocate General in that case suggested a need for a more specific connection, but each case is going to turn on its own facts
default.  
defaultWhere you have a national measure that is playing a role in implementing a specific measure of EU law, there is a good case for saying that measure can fall within the scope of EU law
default.  
defaultDavid Anderson:default The relevant factor, at least in the court’s mind, is not what proportion of the revenue finds its way into the coffers of the European Union; their point is that the tax is required as a matter of EU law and the conditions for its application are required
default.  
defaultThe Committee is well familiar with The Sixth Directive, which goes in great detail through the things one can and cannot levy VAT on, at full rate and reduced rate and so on
default.  
defaultThe reasoning is that because the tax is required by EU law and levied within the framework of EU law, measures that member states take in order to enforce liability for that tax must be consistent with basic standards of EU procedural fairness, including the right not to be criminalised twice for the same offence
default.  
defaultMartin Howe:default I am comforted by the fact that where I am in disagreement with my colleagues on this point I am in agreement with the opinion of the German Federal 
defaultConstitutional Court
default.  
defaultIt does seem to me this is an example where a tiny or indirect connection with European Union law is being used to widen the scope of application of the Charter
default.  
defaultI do not disagree with Professor Craig’s remarks over the distinction between the scope of European Union law and actual implementation
default.  
defaultMy objection to this judgment is that I do not think this, on any reasonable basis, should be regarded as being within the scope of European Union law
default.  
defaultJust because European Union law specifies the quantum and imposes a general obligation on member states to use their general tax-raising powers to collect the money, it does not follow that the details of the mechanisms member states use to collect that and other taxes therefore fall within the scope of European law, which is what this judgment says
default.  
defaultThe observations about the interaction with national law arise directly from the excessive scope of this judgment
default.  
defaultHaving cast the net so wide, they have cast the net to cover a tax system that also involves the collection of purely national taxes
default.  
defaultThey, therefore, necessarily enmesh themselves in the problem of having two parallel sets of fundamental rights standards applying to this scenario
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ38 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Thornton:default To what extent, if at all, has the court of justice clarified the horizontal effect of the Charter, particularly in relation to rights and principles found in Title IV, in its judgment in 
defaultAssociation de 
defaultM
defaulté
defaultdiation
default 
defaultSociale
default 
defaultdelivered on 15 January
default?  
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultProfessor Douglas-Scott:default Those who would prefer not to see a horizontal effect of the Charter might be quite comforted by the court’s recent judgment, because they did not find a horizontal application of the Charter in that particular case
default.  
defaultThey did not find that the provision in the Charter could be used to super charge, as it were, a Directive that also covered the relevant law in that field
default.  
defaultThey found that the provision of the Charter was not sufficiently specific to give rise to a directly enforceable right that could be used in a horizontal situation between two private parties
default.  
defaultIn that respect, they did not go as far as the judgment of the Advocate General in the 
defaultAMS
default case
default, 
defaultnor did they continue down the line of some of their previous case law in 
defaultMangold
default and 
defaultKücükdeveci
default, where they seem to admit some sort of horizontal effect of general principles of law
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ39 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Thornton:default That was not able to overturn the French labour code in that case then
default?  
default&#xa0;
defaultProfessor Douglas-Scott:default No, it was not
default.  
defaultProfessor Craig:default I agree with that
default.  
defaultI would add two things to what my colleague has said
default.  
defaultFirstly, as a matter of principle, given that the court has held, in cases such as 
defaultMangold
default and 
defaultKücükdeveci
default, 
defaultthat general principles
default of law can have a horizontal impact, it would seem to me, as a matter of principle, very odd if it held that Charter rights could never have horizontality
default.  
defaultThat does not work for me at all as a matter of first principle
default.  
defaultI am merely saying that as a matter of legal reasoning
default.  
defaultIf you have a general principle such as non-discrimination, or something of that kind, you have a Charter right covering the same terrain
default.  
defaultIf you said that a general principle, such as non-discrimination on the grounds of age, can have a horizontal impact, which is basically what they said in 
defaultKücükdeveci
default and 
defaultMangold
default, then you have an applicable or an analogous Charter right covering the same subject matter, I cannot see how you would, in principle, deny all horizontality to the latter
default.  
defaultThat is the first point
default.  
defaultThe second point that 
defaultflows from that
default is while the court held this particular Charter right, Article 27, did not qualify for horizontality for the reasons that my colleague mentioned, they also did give a hint, particularly in paragraph 47 of the judgment, that things might be different if a different Charter right had been before the court
default.  
defaultWhat they say in paragraph 47 of the judgment is that in this connection, the facts of the case may be distinguished from those that gave rise to 
defaultKücükdeveci
default,
default insofar as the principle of non-discrimination on the grounds of age, at issue in that case, laid down in Article 21(1) of the Charter is sufficient in itself to confer on individuals an individual right, which they may invoke as such
default.  
defaultIn that sense, they are excluding it in relation to Article 27 but they are not shutting the door
default.  
defaultIn fact, they are leaving the door quite wide ajar in relation to Charter rights that they think are suitable and complete, and therefore susceptible to horizontality
default.  
defaultDavid Anderson:default I agree with both my colleagues
default.  
defaultI might add one word of caution, for myself as much as anybody else: the issue of horizontality is an extraordinarily difficult one
default.  
defaultIt is not a binary issue
default.  
defaultIf you look at Charters of fundamental rights throughout the world, there is a very wide variation
default.  
defaultThe classic example of one that does not acknowledge horizontality is the Constitution of the United States and their Bill of Rights, where application is vertical only, although, even there, under the doctrine of state action, some constitutional guarantees are extended to some relationships between individuals
default.  
defaultAt the other extreme, you have Ireland, in which constitutional guarantees are given direct application in horizontal litigation between individuals
default.  
defaultA taxi driver, as I understand it, can rely on his right to earn a living in order to obtain an injunction against an unlicensed taxi driver
default.  
defaultYou might think it was horizontal litigation and all sorts of difficult situations in the middle
default.  
defaultProfessor Craig cited a very learned article on this subject, which may have been a little too much for my brain; I find Clayton and Tomlinson’s treatment of the subject in their book on human rights is a very useful introduction
default.  
defaultMartin Howe:default On this one, I agree with my colleagues’ analysis of the judgment
default.  
defaultCertainly, the court itself did not go nearly as far as was recommended by the Advocate General, who wanted to effectively create a gateway through the principle of Directives not to have horizontal effects
default.  
defaultThat does leave us, though, with the existing 
defaultKücükdeveci
default case, which is a judgment from 2010 where, although expressed in that judgment, the principle of non-discrimination on the grounds of age is based as a general principle of European Union law and as an exception to the rule against horizontal application.  The interpretation of that judgment in the 
defaultAssocia
defaultt
defaultion de 
defaultM
defaulté
defaultdiation
default 
defaultSociale
default 
defaultjudgment
default delivered last week is, in effect, to distinguish between the levels of precision of the articles of the Charter relating to these two principles
default.  
defaultTherefore, it does open the door, perhaps, to a wider rolling out of the 
defaultKücükdeveci
default principle on to other provisions of the Charter that are sufficiently precise
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ40 default&#xa0; 
defaultChris Kelly:default Can parallels be drawn between the effects of the Charter on UK courts and the effects of section 6 of the Human Rights Act, which includes courts as “public authorities”, for example in the recent decision of the employment appeal tribunal in 
defaultBenkharbouche
default?  
default&#xa0;
defaultDavid Anderson:default Yes, you can draw a parallel
default.  
defaultSection 6 of the Human Rights Act makes it plain that the courts are public authorities and are therefore bound by the requirements of the Human Rights Act
default.  
defaultThere is a vigorous academic debate, probably in fact more vigorous in its academic form than it has been so far in case law, as to exactly what that means and where 
defaultalong the almost infinite spectrum of horizontality the English courts are going to come out
default.  
defaultThe 
defaultAMS
default case is very far from the last word of the European Court of Justice on horizontality
default.  
defaultThere are bound to be many more issues to work out
default.  
defaultIn working them out, I am sure they will have regard to Article 51 of the Charter, which also addresses the obligations to bodies, including the institutions of the Union and therefore including the courts of the Union, and addresses the obligations also to the member states
default.  
defaultI would have thought—the professors may have other views—that according to the doctrine of the indivisibility of the state under international law, the reference to the member states is likely to include the courts of the member states, as well as their other institutions
default.  
defaultEven after 10 or 12 years of the Human Rights Act, we are very far from understanding exactly how its horizontal application will work out
default.  
defaultWe are further still in the case of the Charter
default.  
defaultMartin Howe:default Section 6 of the Human Rights Act is very interesting because, on the face of it, one would have thought the application of the Act to the courts is in respect of their own procedures
default.  
defaultIn other words, they are obliged to conduct their own procedures
default.  
defaultPrincipally, the requirements of Article 6 regarding fair trial are the obligations which most relevantly impact on the way courts operate
default.  
defaultWhat has happened is this has been used as an argument to introduce horizontality, most notably in the context of the creation of a new, horizontal right to privacy, which parliament itself has never decided to create through, among other things, the argument that, since the court is itself bound by Section 6 of the Human Rights Act, the court must adapt substantive doctrines of common law that apply as between citizens in order to create, in effect, new rights
default.  
defaultTherefore, the act, in effect, has binding effects on private citizens, through that gateway, as well as on public institutions
default.  
defaultCertainly, one can see a road for a parallel chained logic in the application of the EU Charter
default.  
defaultProfessor Craig:default I agree with what has already been said
default.  
defaultI would add two points
default.  
defaultFirstly, the basic problem faced in Section 6 and in Article 51, in terms of the horizontality issue, is the same
default.  
defaultIt is the point that David Anderson has already mentioned: to what extent do we think that fundamental or constitutional rights should only have a vertical application against the state, and to what extent do we believe that they should also be applicable between individuals
default?  
defaultThat issue is raised in the context of Section 6 of the HRA
default.  
defaultIt is raised in the context of Article 51 of the Charter as well
default.  
defaultI am one of those who take a rather more radical view of this kind of thing than, perhaps, some other people
default.  
defaultVery briefly, it is this: the classic argument against horizontality is that it intrudes too far into personal autonomy
default.  
defaultThat is fundamentally what it is all about: that fundamental rights should only, in principle, have an application against the state and should not have an application horizontally as between private individuals; to do so would be too intrusive on their private autonomy
default.  
defaultThe problem with that argument is that, when you start thinking about it, it looks a good deal weaker than it did at the beginning
default.  
defaultParliament and the common law are making intrusions into private autonomy the whole time
default.  
defaultThey do so with legislation the whole time
default.  
defaultThey do so with common law doctrine the whole time
default.  
defaultOne way at least—I am not saying it is the sole answer—of considering horizontality and standing back from the detail is to ask the fundamental question of principle, which is that if a right is felt to be fundamental, and hence included in a Constitutional Bill of Rights, why should it not, in principle, also be applicable as between private individuals
default?  
defaultI am not saying that there are no circumstances in which one would reach a negative answer
default.  
defaultThere may be good reasons why particular constitutional rights should not apply as between private individuals
default.  
defaultBut if you pose the question in the way I just mentioned, it is not at all obvious 
defaultthat, for example, a private individual should be able to discriminate on the grounds of sex, gender, race or anything else—even in purely private dealings with other individuals
default.  
defaultIn many instances we have statute to regulate that terrain anyway but, even if we did not, if we think as a fundamental principle those kinds of discrimination are wrong if conducted by the State, I am not quite sure why we would think they were right if conducted by private individuals
default.  
defaultProfessor Douglas-Scott:default I would certainly agree with what Professor Craig has said, although I could add two short points
default.  
defaultOne would be that, if you look at the actual rights in the Charter, not every single one of them is capable of having horizontal effect, because some are directed only to the bodies of the Union
default.  
defaultArticle 42 on the right to access documents is one such; it is addressed only to EU agencies and institutions
default.  
defaultSecondly, I would say, as David Anderson has said, horizontality is an extremely complex subject
default.  
defaultRelated to it is the requirement that has been set down in EU law, that the courts interpret national law in the light of obligations under EU law, insofar as it is possible to do so—sometimes called indirect effect—which is often seen as an example of horizontality
default.  
defaultIt was because in the 
defaultAMS
default case that it was not possible to interpret the French measure in the light of EU law that, in fact, the Directive could not be applied
default.  
defaultBut in many cases such 
defaulta conform
default interpretation would be possible, and that would end up having a sort of horizontal effect on private parties
default.  
default 
defaultChair:default Could I now ask Stephen Phillips if you would be good enough to ask the first question in relation to Protocol 30
default?  
defaultWe have a problem, which is, in a nutshell, we could be just about to have a vote, if there is going to be one called
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ41 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Phillips:default Protocol 30, I think you would all agree, and can we begin by confirming this, is not an opt-out protocol
default.  
defaultI think that is the view of each of you; is that correct
default?  
defaultI will record for the transcript that everybody is agreeing but we have to go and vote
default. 
defaultChair:default We will adjourn for 10 minutes and we will see how quickly we can get through the lobbies and come back as soon as possible
default.  
defaultThank you
default.   
defaultSitting suspended for a Division in the House
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultOn resuming—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ42 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Phillips:default Now, we are all agreed that Protocol 30 is not an opt-out
default.  
defaultWe established that just before we rose for the division
default.  
defaultThat is a conclusion to which our predecessor committee came, and one of the purposes of this report is to clarify that to the house
default.  
defaultI think you also all agree, but tell me if I am wrong, that Article 1(1) of the Protocol is simply a reflection of Article 51(1) of the Charter itself
default.  
defaultIs that common ground between the four of you at least
default?  
defaultYes, I see no dissent and, indeed, lots of nodding of heads
default.  
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat I want to explore a little is to what extent you think Article 1(2) gives any additional protection for the United Kingdom against, for example, the applicability of the solidarity rights, a protection that is not contained within the Charter or within any pre-existing general principles of EU law
default.  
defaultWhat does Article 1(2) actually achieve?  Does it go beyond Article 1(1)?   
default&#xa0;
defaultProfessor Craig:default It seems to me that it does add something
default.  
defaultWhile 1(1) is certainly not an opt-out, for all the reasons we discussed last time, Article 1(2) does have the substantive content
default.  
defaultIt particularly has the substantive content in relation to those provisions of Title IV that do not have any condition about national laws and practices
default.  
defaultThe meaning of that phrase I will come back to in a moment
default.  
defaultHowever, there are certain rights or provisions within Title IV, like Article 29, concerning the right to a free placement service, and Article 31, which, in the absence of Protocol 30 Article 1(2), could or might be interpreted by the court as being genuine rights
default.  
defaultIn relation to the UK, however, Article 1(2) of Protocol 30 would prevent that interpretation from being applicable
default.  
defaultIn that respect, my view is that Article 1(2) does add a substantive impact in particular in relation to those parts of Title IV where there is no condition of the right being found in a national law or practice
default.  
defaultProfessor Douglas-Scott:default I agree with what Professor Craig said but I would add one thing, which is that even if Article 1(2) of the Protocol does succeed in having that effect regarding certain rights, there may still be a problem with general principles of law, which might nonetheless be applicable because the Protocol does not apply to them
default.  
defaultIn that case, an interesting question would be whether rights, particularly those rights in Title IV, actually extend beyond general principles of law so that the Protocol does, as I call it in my evidence, a belt-and-braces job there
default.  
defaultOtherwise, you are still left with the problem of general principles of law taking effect
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ43 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Phillips:default Mr Anderson and Mr Howe, do you want to add anything to that
default?  
defaultDavid Anderson:default Not really
default.  
defaultI very much agree with Professor Craig
default.  
defaultI could quibble on one point but I do not wish to take the Committee’s time
default.  
default 
defaultStephen Phillips:default Quibble away
default.  
defaultDavid Anderson:default Perhaps implicit in what Professor Craig said was that the United Kingdom and Poland are placed in a privileged position by the Protocol; I am not sure whether he actually intended to say that or not
default.  
defaultI would see the Protocol more as confirmatory of the general position, albeit expressed to be in the context of the UK and Poland
default.  
defaultTherefore, one would expect that the added protection available in Article 1(2) ought to be available to others to argue as well
default,
default although I have not seen any sign in the case law so far of other member states taking that point
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ44 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Phillips:default That does rather bring me on to my next question, which is this: what on earth do the words “in particular and for the avoidance of doubt” mean at the commencement of Article 1(2) if, indeed, it contains something substantive that is not to be found in Article 1(1) of the Protocol?
default&#xa0;
defaultMartin Howe:default The only way to square the circle is by looking back to the horizontal article, Article 52, paragraph five, of the Charter, which is the one relating to the distinction between principles and rights, and to regard Article 1 paragraph 2 of the Protocol as, in effect, 
defaultclassifying everything under Title IV of the Charter as falling in the heading of principles, rather than rights
default.  
defaultIf you do that, it does not mean they have no legal effect at all, because, as we discussed at our last session, they can be relied upon to both interpret legislative acts, and thereby indirectly affect the way the law applies on the ground as it were, or indeed potentially to invalidate them, even if they are not themselves great rights of their own
default.  
defaultI strongly suspect that this will be interpreted very narrowly, because it is a very odd instrument in the sense that, on the face of it, it creates special status for Poland and the United Kingdom
default.  
defaultOn the other hand, the European Court will be very anxious to interpret it in a way that results in no special status, because they are very keen on uniform application of European Law
default.  
defaultI suspect the way they will do it is to treat it as declaratory of the underlying situation under the Charter and interpret it narrowly
default.  
defaultThe way you would interpret Article 1(2) narrowly is to focus on the word “creates”
default.  
defaultNothing in Title IV of the Charter creates 
defaultjusticiable
default rights
default.  
defaultIt does not follow that Title IV of the Charter does not alter the scope of rights that are present in other instruments
default.  
defaultDavid Anderson:default I rather agree with that
default.  
defaultFor proponents of Article 1(2) and those who want to see it given some force, it is possibly troubling that the court, so far, does not appear to have had much regard to it—perhaps because it has not been pleaded before it
default.  
defaultThe 
defaultAMS
default case was mentioned, which was decided a week ago today
default.  
defaultParagraph 45 sums up the effect of Article 27, which is one of the Title IV rights—I think the right of workers to be consulted—and the court said, “It is therefore clear from the wording of Article 27 of the Charter that for this Article to be fully effective, it must be given more specific expression in European Union or national law.”  Perhaps if the United Kingdom had been there, they would have been pushing for wording more along the lines of, “It is clear from the wording of Article 27 of the Charter, viewed in conjunction with Article 1(2) of the Protocol, that for this Article to be 
defaultjusticiable
default, it must be given specific expression in national law.”  That opportunity was not taken
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ45 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Phillips:default Can I move on to Article 2 of Protocol 30
default?  
defaultWhat does that achieve for the United Kingdom and for Poland, if anything
default?  
default&#xa0;
defaultProfessor Craig:default Article two is interesting
default.  
defaultIt does reveal a genuine ambiguity in the Charter
default.  
defaultWhen one looks at the particular articles in the Charter, the common phrase in relation to a number of the Charter articles in Title IV is “and under the conditions provided for by union law and national laws and practices”. 
defaultIn a literal, textual sense, the phrase “and national laws and practices” could mean one of two things
default.  
defaultIt could either mean that the particular right in question must be recognised in the national law of France, Germany or Italy, i.e
default. 
defaultwhatever State is before the court at the time
default.  
defaultThat is one view and is probably the orthodox common view
default.  
defaultIt would also be textually possible, although I am not advocating this, to read the relevant phrase, “Provided for by union law and national laws and practices,” in a broad way, to mean the following: that provided the relevant right is there in 20 of the laws of the member states, it will suffice
default.  
defaultThe way I regard Article 2 of the Protocol is for abundance of caution
default.  
defaultThat is, it is recognising that might be a possible reading of this phrase in Title IV and it is saying the UK and Poland do not buy into that broader reading
default.  
defaultAny time you mention national law and practice it has to be in the national law and practice of the UK and Poland
default.  
defaultProfessor Douglas-Scott:default When I first looked at Article 2 of the Protocol, I thought it might just be taken as confirming Article 52, paragraph 6, of the Charter, “Full account shall be taken of national laws and practices as specified in this Charter.”  However, I will add something to what Professor Craig has just said, which is with those provisions in the Charter that refer to both national and Union law, there is the risk that Union law and national law may conflict
default.  
defaultThen what should be done
default?  
defaultIn this case, Article 2 may be very useful, in that it would confirm the national law reading
default.  
defaultDavid Anderson:default I agree with Professor Craig.
defaultMartin Howe:default To illustrate this point, let us take Article 27 of the Charter, which is the worker’s right to information and consultation
default.  
defaultThat states that the workers and their representatives are guaranteed information and consultation in good time, in the cases and under the conditions provided for by Union law and national law and practices
default.  
defaultIn a sense, the right is expressed as being not a general right, but only a right that arises to the extent that either Union or national law provides it
default.  
defaultIf Union law provides a right to information or consultation, it seems to me, under general principles, that overwrites national laws and you do not need a national law basis
default.  
defaultArticle 2 of the Protocol is irrelevant to that scenario
default.  
defaultOn the face of it, Article 2 says no more than—and it is implicit in the words of Article 27—”In the cases provided for by national laws and practice.”  If there is no provision for information in a particular case under national law, then the Article 27 right is not envisaged
default.  
defaultIt might be, as Professor Craig said, to resolve an ambiguity that might have arisen looking at a survey of national laws and practices across the European Union, rather than state by state
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ46 default&#xa0; 
defaultStephen Phillips:default My final question on Protocol 30—I think I already know Mr Anderson’s answer—is how valuable do you assess Protocol 30 as being for the United Kingdom and Poland?
default&#xa0;
defaultMartin Howe:default I think it is of little or no value
default.  
defaultDavid Anderson:default Article 1(2), in particular, is potentially valuable because it offers a way out of the morass of the right/principle distinction, which no one so far has made any sense of and gives at least a strong basis on which to argue that the solidarity rights do not apply in the United Kingdom unless given specific effect here
default.  
defaultProfessor Craig:default I agree with Mr Anderson
default.  
defaultProfessor Douglas-Scott:default I agree too
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ47 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Clappison:default Can I come in on another global question on the Charter of Fundamental Rights as a whole and ask the two practitioners what they think the impact of the Charter will be on human rights litigation in the United Kingdom in the years to come, say in five years’ time
default?  
default&#xa0;
defaultMartin Howe:default By definition it is difficult to foresee, because the way these things work is that cases come along and new principles will be adopted
default.  
defaultIt can only be expansive, although perhaps in an unpredictable way
default.  
defaultWe slightly covered this at our last session, because there 
defaultare instances where, from the point of view of the litigant, it is worthwhile to rely on arguments under the Charter, either in tandem with parallel arguments under the European Convention on Human Rights and the Human Rights Act, or as an alternative to them
default.  
defaultThe attraction of relying on them as an alternative is the different scope of the rights in the Charter and the greater effect, in that, if you can engage European Union law, you can effectively knock out primary acts of parliament, whereas under the Human Rights Act you cannot achieve that
default.  
defaultDavid Anderson:default Probably the biggest effect I have noticed so far is in the application of the fair trial right to immigration cases, which are excluded from the scope of Article 6, which is limited to criminal and civil cases
default.  
defaultAnother possible application is in the area of criminal law, where there is a new principle in Article 49, since adopted by Strasbourg as well but not present in the original Article 7 of the European Convention, to the effect that if people are serving sentences for an offence and those sentences are subsequently reduced, they cannot serve any longer than the reduced sentence
default.  
defaultThe third thing I would anticipate is that I have done a certain amount of litigation for little guys—small British companies or individuals who have fallen foul of the European institutions, which have behaved in perhaps an arbitrary or high-handed way—and generally this Charter is going to be useful for them
default.  
defaultFor example, rights like the right to good administration are now given the same status as the treaty itself, which could be quite influential in the courts
default.  
defaultProfessor Craig:default I am not a practitioner but might I add one thought on this
default?
default  
defaultThere is an analogy here between the position in the UK pre the HRA and the position in the EU prior to the HRA
default.  
defaultThe courts had already developed the idea that fundamental rights were recognised and embedded in the common law, so they existed prior to the HRA
default.  
defaultNonetheless, when the HRA was enacted and the rights were then laid down definitively in an act of parliament, there was a transformation of judicial review in the United Kingdom
default.  
defaultYou have rights-based arguments pleaded in a great many cases in a way that you did not in the 1990s and 1980s
default.  
defaultMy strong suspicion in the EU is that we are going to see the same thing
default.  
defaultIn the EU we had fundamental rights developed as general principles of law for many years, and they were used and pleaded
default.  
defaultNonetheless, in the post-Charter world, we are going to see very many more rights-based claims, both against EU institutions and member states when they act in the scope of EU law
default.  
defaultIn particular, because of the point that was mentioned by David Anderson, which is that in the post-Lisbon world, the area of freedom, security and justice has been rolled into the main treaty, many of the regulations and Directives passed in relation to immigration, asylum and that kind of thing—criminal procedure—are contentious
default.  
defaultThey naturally give rise to rights-based claims
default.  
defaultThe combination of concretising rights in the Charter on the one hand and then including new areas within the court’s full jurisdiction is likely to lead to a very significant growth in rights-based claims
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ48 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Clappison:default Forgive me if you have already dealt with this and I have not taken it on board, which is quite possible, but what happens as far as the United Kingdom opt-out from parts of the area of freedom, security and justice is concerned?
default  
defaultWould the Charter of Fundamental Rights apply notwithstanding that
default?  
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultProfessor Craig:default No
default.  
defaultThat is a very good question
default.  
defaultIt is an extremely good question and my initial intuition is no, but actually I think that is too hasty
default.  
defaultWhat we have in the opt-out from the AFSJ measures is the ability to opt out from selected AFSJ regulations directives if we so choose
default.  
defaultHowever, the mere fact that we have or have not done that, but even assuming we have opted out of the relevant directive, does not in and of itself seem to me to lead logically to the conclusion that someone might not plead a charter right in relation to the UK
default.  
defaultThe difficulty that the claimant would have 
defaultnonetheless,
default and I am genuinely thinking aloud here as this is quite a taxing question, is to show that there was some lock on to the UK from EU law in relation to the particular immigration concern of which they were complaining
default.  
defaultIf, in effect, the lock on to EU law was dependent upon the UK actually having signed up to a particular directive or regulation that they had not signed up to, I am straining to see how they would find the requisite lock on to EU law in order to use the Charter
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ49 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default We have another witness coming and I am conscious of the fact that we need to move on to the final question
default.  
defaultMr Howe, you wanted to add something
default?  
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultMartin Howe:default Yes, there are two issues here
default.  
defaultThis is related to the block opt-out on Justice and Home Affairs measures
default.  
defaultUnder the current position, the United Kingdom does not accept the jurisdiction of the European Court over Justice 
defaultand Home Affairs third pillar measures
default.  
defaultThere is no recourse to the European Court of Justice to those who would get to the Charter of Fundamental Rights in that context
default.  
defaultIf we block opt out
default and re-adhere to them, they will then become recourse
default.  
defaultAs a matter of international law, it is right that the EU Charter, on the international level, does apply to those measures, even though the European court jurisdiction does not
default.  
defaultTherefore, if a relevant question arises, it would be for our courts, rather than the European court, to interpret how the Charter applies in that context
default.  
defaultQ50 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I see Paul Craig nodding at that point, and I would like to move on because we have a very important question
default.  
defaultWe have given you notice of this because it is on parliamentary sovereignty and, in a broad sense, derives for example from Chapter 12 of Lord Bingham’s book 
defaultThe Rule of Law
default.  
defaultI will simply read out the question which you have in front of you and then I am going to ask each of you, if you would be kind enough, to give me your view
default.
default 
defaultIn your view, would the following provision of primary legislation suffice to 
defaultdisapply
default the application of all EU fundamental rights in the UK, whether derived from general principles of EU law, legal bases within the EU Treaties, or the Charter
default?  
defaultThe following provision of primary legislation would be as follows: 
default“
defaultNotwithstanding any provision of the European Communities Act 1972, none of the rights, freedoms or principles referred to in Article 6(3) of the Treaty on European Union, or in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, or deriving elsewhere from within the EU Treaties, or otherwise determined by the Court of Justice, shall form part of the law applicable in any part of the U
defaultK.”
defaultProfessor Douglas-Scott:default This, on the face of it, seems to be in direct conflict with EU law
default.  
defaultHowever, if we take the view that EU law ultimately takes effect in the UK through the European Communities Act, what is presented is a conflict between two parliamentary statutes
default.  
defaultSince the 
defaultMetric Martyrs
default case, 
defaultThoburn
default, we have seen the growth of a doctrine of constitutional statutes, which suggest that an implied repeal would not be effective, but an 
defaultexpressed appeal might be so
default.  
defaultSo, a court that was seized with this provision and the European Communities Act would face a very, very difficult choice of which to follow
default.  
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ51 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I do not think Lord Bingham would have very much difficulty with it, would he?
default&#xa0;
defaultProfessor Douglas-Scott:default I cannot speak for Lord Bingham
default.  
defaultI also think: why would you want to do this in this case
default?  
default 
defaultChair:default I cannot imagine
default.  
defaultMichael Connarty:default I think 
defaultwe would, about 30 years ago, tell you 
defaultyou
default 
defaultmight want to do this
default.  
defaultProfessor Douglas-Scott:default To 
defaultdisapply
default those very constraints that operate on the European Union, which are ways of lessoning the competences of the EU and keeping a break on it through the application of fundamental rights, strikes me as a rather curious thing to do
default.  
defaultChair:default I will pass on to the next professor at that point
default.  
defaultProfessor Craig:default This formulation is clearly a modification of the formulation that you had put forward earlier in the debates—
defaultChair:default I would call it an improvement
default.  
defaultProfessor Craig:default I have two points
default.  
defaultFirstly, we clearly place ourselves in straightforward violation of EU law by doing this
default.  
defaultThat is the first point
default.  
defaultWe, as the United Kingdom, cannot unilaterally alter EU law
default.  
defaultWe cannot unilaterally create 
defaulta derogation
default for ourselves from any provision of EU law other than that which is already in the Lisbon Treaty
default.  
defaultInsofar as this would be creating a unilateral derogation from the entire Charter and from Article 6(3) of the TEU, it would be in straightforward breach of EU law
default.  
defaultThe legal and political consequences of that are too complex to go into at the moment
default.  
defaultThat is from the perspective of the EU
default.  
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ52 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Does EU law not only apply to the United Kingdom because of the voluntary enactment of the European Communities Act 1972 by this parliament
default?  
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultProfessor Craig:default Indeed it does
default.  
defaultThat is undoubtedly true from the perspective of UK constitutional law
default.  
defaultFrom the perspective of UK constitutional law, the ECA of 1972 brought EU law, or EC law as it was then, into domestic law—absolutely
default.  
defaultHowever, that does not lead to the proposition, logically, with respect, or in any other way, that allows us unilaterally to alter the terms of our membership of the EU
default.  
defaultAt present, the legal status quo is that we are bound by the Charter because we all agree that Protocol 30 of Article 1 is not a complete opt-out
default.  
defaultWe are also, at present, indisputably bound by Article 6(3) of the TEU, insofar as it talks about general principles of law, etc
default.  
defaultInsofar as this provision—if enacted into a statute and recognised by our courts—were to alter that legal status quo from the perspective of UK constitutional law, it would still be indisputably in violation of the Treaty
default.  
defaultWe have no right, unilaterally, to alter the terms of our membership of that club
default.  
defaultThat is from the perspective of the EU
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ53 default&#xa0; 
defaultJacob Rees-Mogg:default On that point, is that a general rule of international treaties—that one party to them cannot pull out of an individual aspect—
defaultor
default would it only apply to the European treaties
default?  
default&#xa0;
defaultProfessor Craig:default If a treaty that you have signed up to either, in general, has some right of unilateral variation or a particular state has created and read into the treaty when it signed up a particular right of derogation that would pertain to that particular state and no other state, then they can use that unilateral right
default.  
defaultIn the absence of such a provision, it is a general rule of treaty law that you cannot unilaterally vary or amend a treaty
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ54 default&#xa0; 
defaultJacob Rees-Mogg:default Can you, 
defaulttherefore ,either
default pull out entirely of a treaty or remain subject to all its requirements, unless the treaty says otherwise, and that would apply to any treaty and it is not a European issue
default?  
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultProfessor Craig:default 
defaultYes,
default and indeed one of the interesting changes made by the Lisbon Treaty is that the Lisbon Treaty, by way of contrast to treaties that proceeded it, does now have a set of provisions contained at the end of the Treaty of the European Union that deals specifically with the circumstances of pulling out completely
default.  
defaultThere were no detailed expressed provisions of that kind before
default.  
defaultThere is no doubt that one can, as it were, leave
default.  
defaultThen there are steps that one has to go through that are laid down
default.  
defaultAgain, if one left, one is bound by the steps laid down in the Lisbon treaty for leaving
default.  
defaultIf you have a marriage breakup, as it were, these are the terms of the breakup
default.  
defaultDavid Anderson:default My first comment on this that it seems to me wildly uncertain in its scope
default.  
defaultOriginally I read it as simply an attempt to opt out of the Charter and of the other fundamental rights that the court may from time to time declare
default.  
defaultBut I see, in fact, that it applies to all rights, freedoms or principles deriving from the EU treaties or otherwise determined by the Court of Justice
default.
default  I wonder if, in fact, it is intended as an opt-out from the entirety of European law
default.  
defaultWhatever its scope, whether broad or narrow, what would happen
default?  
defaultI can only imagine the European Commission would commence urgent infringement proceedings against the United Kingdom, because whatever the position in domestic constitutional law, this would be a plain infringement of our treaty obligations
default.  
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ55 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Like the breach of the Stability and Growth Pact by Germany and France, for example, some 10 years ago
default?  
default&#xa0;
defaultDavid Anderson:default Yes, but that was one thing
default.  
defaultWho knows what the Commission will decide, but if ever one has seen a threat to the legal stability of the European Union, it would be this
default.
default  Infringement proceedings would be begun; a judgment would, no doubt, be arrived at that we were in breach of the treaty; and then, thanks to the amendment inserted I think by Mrs Thatcher into the Maastricht Treaty, the fining provisions would come into play.   If we failed to remedy our defect, we would be subjected to a daily penalty and/or a lump sum penalty, unless we have mended our ways.  
defaultChair:default I think this might be a political decision at that stage, but anyway.
defaultDavid Anderson:default Yes, indeed it would.  But one can only imagine that, with such a major threat to the Union legal 
defaultorder, that
default would, at least, be a possible consequence—I would say a probable consequence.
defaultI will just add one other point, which might be on a more cheerful note.  Since Metric Martyrs was mentioned—the German Federal Constitutional Court was mentioned—the Committee may already be aware that a judgment was handed down this morning by the United Kingdom Supreme Court of the very greatest constitutional importance, strangely enough in the HS2 case.  The case of the protestors was rejected.  May I direct the Committee’s attention to paragraphs 206 to 208 of the judgment?  I will give you a flavour from 207: “
defaultIt is, putting the point at its lowest, certainly arguable (and it is for United Kingdom law and courts to determine) that there may be fundamental principles, whether contained in other constitutional instruments or recognised at common law, of which Parliament when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972 did not either contemplate or authorise the abrogation.
default”  In other words, there may be cases in which Europe tells us to do something and our courts, rather in the manner of the German Federal Constitutional Court, will stand up and say, “Sorry, there are either constitutional principles here set out in statute or principles acknowledged by the courts that make it impossible for us to do that.”  
defaultMartin Howe:default First of all, let me deal with the legal question: “Would this be legally effective?”  In my view, this is not a difficult question.  Purely as a matter of United Kingdom constitutional law, we can alter the scope of the 1972 Act by an expressly worded amendment.  That was really put beyond doubt by the enactment of Section 18—the so-called sovereignty clause—of the European Union Act of 2011.  
defaultIndeed, I must say that I did not pick up that judgment myself this morning, but David Anderson kindly showed it to me while we were sitting in the corridor.  That, interestingly, reflects a judicial understanding at the highest level that the 1972 Act, even though it says in terms that it prevails over any other Act, may implicitly be limited by certain other fundamental constitutional provisions of United Kingdom law, in particular, in that context, in relation to Article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1689 on the non-review by the judiciary of the proceedings of Parliament.  Even if European Union law would purport to require the courts to review the proceedings of Parliament, they are precluded by constitutional norms from doing so.
defaultTherefore, it can be limited.  There may then 
defaultarise
default a 
defaultdisconformity
default between international obligations on the international plane and the internal law of the United Kingdom.  If that arises, that is primarily a diplomatic and political matter, rather than, as it were, a legal matter.  As politicians, you need to think about the consequences of that, but it can legally be done.  Despite Mr Anderson saying that this sort of measure would immediately attract Commission direct action, Germany, of course, has, in a sense, had a similar provision under its own law, in that it adheres to the position of the primacy of its basic law and the rights enshrined in it over European Union law, and indeed other aspects of its constitution.  So far, that has not attracted a Commission direct action for 
defaultdisconformity
default and nor is it likely to.  That question depends on the context of such a provision, the way it is framed and the circumstances in which it is put forward.  
defaultFinally, there is, in a sense, a point regarding the way this is phrased, in that does it leave European Union actions in the United Kingdom free of any review from a fundamental rights 
defaultperspective?  If, for example, we were to couple it with a provision requiring review of such actions by reference to our own constitution—national constitutional rights standards—that would close that gap.  Also, it would make it more analogous to the German scenario.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ56 default&#xa0; 
defaultMichael Connarty:default But that is my point.  
defaultI was going to ask this
default, Martin, when you started to talk about Germany.  This is not the same as the German constitutional challenges; this is a complete opt-out and abrogation of all rights given to our citizens by the EU on the basis that it will then free us up to have any draconian laws we wish with no outside body—maybe apart from an appeal to the United Nations—to stop it.  It could be seen as a very dangerous thing to say we opt out of all these agreements that have been signed up to since 1972.  It is not the 
defaultsame as what the Germans are challenging when they go to their constitutional court about the application of EU regulations.  It is oranges and apples you are comparing.  You said change it into apples, so that it will be similar to Germany, but I do not think it would be.  I do not think you will find these contents in the countries more generally.  To plead Germany as a possible support case for this kind of unilateral action is not fundamentally sound.
default&#xa0;
defaultMartin Howe:default I agree with the point you put about the difference between this: that this is eliminating the rights, rather than having your own national set of rights that take primacy, which is the German scenario.  I agree that that is different.  
defaultChair:default I think we are going to have to move on because Lord Goldsmith has been waiting for some time.  By all means do ask another question if you would like to, but I do think that we need to move on.  
defaultProfessor Craig:default One very final observation on that is that, in terms of practical consequences, not only would you have the possibility of the Commission suit and daily damages, you would have the potential for multiple 
defaultFrancovich
default 
defaultdamages actions brought by private individuals.  
defaultChair:default Well, Mr Howe disagrees.  We have to leave it at that.  Thank you all very much indeed for coming, and we will be giving careful consideration to all your arguments as we proceed.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultExamination of WitnessdefaultWitness:
default 
defaultRtdefault Hon the Lord Goldsmith PC QCdefault, gave evidence.
defaultQ57 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Lord Goldsmith, thank you very much for coming.  I am sorry we have been rather delayed, partly because of the vote.  I think the sooner we get on, the better.  I have, first of all, an introductory question to put, apart from thanking you very much for coming today.  In order to save time, can I ask you, first of all—to try to clear some of the undergrowth—whether you agree with the following five general propositions, which we believe summarise your written evidence, before we turn to any more detailed questions?  Firstly, the Charter does not create new EU fundamental rights, but consolidates existing rights in a more visible form.  
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: Yes.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ58 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Secondly, it distinguishes between rights, freedoms and principles, the last of which are not directly enforceable.  
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: Save to the extent that they are then enacted into national law or possibly international law through specific EU legislation.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ59 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Thirdly, the horizontal articles clearly restrict the application of the Charter. 
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: Amongst other things, yes.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ60 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Protocol 30 is not an opt-out protocol; it is an interpretive protocol, which underscores the limited application of the Charter and applies equally to all member states.
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: Yes, but let me just clarify that.  It certainly was not intended as an opt-out but as a guarantee.  It is a guarantee of what the Charter is supposed to do, but because it is legally binding, if the Charter were to be interpreted as going beyond what the Protocol envisages, then it would have legal effect.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ61 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Lastly, in the unlikely event that courts do interpret the Charter to create new or extend existing rights, the Protocol may provide the UK and Poland with additional safeguards.
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: I think t
defaulthat is what I have just said
default.  That is a summary of the last point I was trying to make.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ62 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Clappison:default Lord Goldsmith, you represented the Government in the Convention that drew up the Charter.  Can you explain how you were able to satisfy yourself that each of the articles reflected pre-existing rights, freedoms or principles that apply to all EU member states, so that nothing new was established by the Charter? 
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: Well, essentially, because that is set out in the explanations.  Can I just say something about the history of the explanations?  The political framework in which this was happening was that there was a strong call for an EU-wide statement of fundamental rights for several reasons: one, some people wanted it just because they wanted to see a statement of fundamental rights at the European Union level.  Other people believed it was important—and I shared this view—that the EU institutions, and member states therefore when they were implementing Union law, should be constrained in what they did by exactly the same sorts of fundamental principles regarding the protection of individuals that apply to national governments.  
defaultNow, the EU was not subject to the ECHR.  Strictly speaking, it was not a party to the ECHR, although European jurisprudence had grown up the idea that the ECHR was a part of 
defaultthe general principles that apply to the European Union.  Otherwise, the consequence was that individuals might find themselves subjected to abuses of power by Brussels, which would not be constrained in the same way that abuses of power by a national government would be by a domestic constitution that protected fundamental rights, or indeed by the ECHR.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ63 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Clappison:default Can I just ask about one point arising directly out of that?  I understand that, but it is the case, is it not, that the Lisbon Treaty does contain provision that the European Union shall accede to the European Convention on Human Rights?
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: That is true.  At the time the Charter was being drafted, there was some discussion about the possibility of meeting these objectives—or some of these objectives, because we could not have met all of them—by the EU acceding to the ECHR, which it could not do at the time because it did not have the power to do so.  Eventually, the decision was made to do that as well, but, by that stage, the Charter had been drafted and it had been dealt with in the intergovernmental conference, so that really became an addition.  
defaultOf course, just to underline the point I made a moment ago, the rights we are talking about are not simply ECHR rights; they are fundamental rights that derive from other instruments.  And the idea behind the explanation I am going to explain is that what we were faced with is that many people wanted a broadly stated Charter of Rights.  I have described it occasionally as a sort of poetic statement, in the way that constitutions often are.  Everyone is entitled to liberty, freedom, the pursuit of happiness and so forth.  
defaultFrom a legal point of view, it is very nice to have that, but it is very dangerous to have that.  The risk is that you do not know what it is that you have created, because a court can interpret that in a particular way.  My proposed solution to that was to have the Charter in two parts.  Originally I called it part A and part B.  Part A would have this nice statement of right
defaults
default, as indeed the ECHR has itself, because it expresses things in a short, clear, poetic way, but there would be a part B that told you what the detail was.  The part B became the explanations, which tied the individual statement of rights back to the underlying right that it was, as it were, reflecting—was making more visible.  That was what the Cologne conclusion said: “Make these rights more visible.”  That is part of the reason why it was not creating new rights.  That is why the explanations were important.  
defaultThe first time around, of course, the Charter was declared simply in a solemn but non-binding way, so it did not matter.  The status of the explanations was a bit ambiguous.  Then, when we came to possibly including them in the draft constitution—when that episode took place—more attention was paid to the explanations and a form of words was agreed that would give the explanations a force.
defaultThen, in the Lisbon Treaty, they are given a force in Article 6, but they are given, in a sense, almost even more force in Protocol 30.  Article 6 talks about due regard to the explanations, whereas the Lisbon Protocol—Protocol 30—talks about strict compliance with the explanations.  That was what we wanted in order to underline the importance of the explanations—tying the rights back to the existing rights.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ64 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Clappison:default One issue—one of the rights—that has caught my eye purely because it is something that is subject to quite a lot of public interest at the moment is Article 34 on social security and social assistance.  I do not know if you have got it there in front of you.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultLord Goldsmith: I have, yes.
default&#xa0;
defaultMr Clappison:default defaultArticle 34(2) says: “Everyone residing and moving legally within the European Union is entitled to social security benefits and social advantages in accordance with Community law and national laws and practices.”  Can you be sure that Article does not give rise to more rights than were in existence at the time the Charter was framed?  
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: If you take into account the Protocol, it does become important at this stage.  Whether it was necessary is another issue, and that is one of the reasons one starts to say things like “for the avoidance of doubt” because you think the Charter already does provide something.  This appears in Title 4, and in Title 4 they are called solidarity rights, but they are really social and economic rights.  That was one of the biggest issues for the United Kingdom.  A lot 
defaultof countries want to see social and economic rights made 
defaultjusticiable
default.  It is a very live issue in terms of human rights.  The social charter, of course, was very much in existence at the time.
default The UK did not want to go further than we were already at that stage, and it was quite a neuralgic issue.  This was the area particularly where principles came in.  What the Protocol was doing, and I
default know you have it very clearly in mind from the questions I have heard already, was to say that in relation to Title 4, which is what Article 1(2) relates to—solidarity rights; the social and economic rights—it is made very clear in Protocol 30 that does not create 
defaultjusticiable
default rights applicable here or, indeed, in Poland, except to the extent that we have provided for those in our national law.  If we provide, therefore, for social security rights in our national law, which may be as a result of implementation of Union law, then the Charter is saying, “Well, those rights are there.”  However, insofar as we have not created them, they are not in existence other than by virtue of a general statement in the Charter.  The Charter does not create any further rights.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ65 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Thornton:default Some of that bears directly on the next question.  Some of the articles are not derived from pre-existing EU obligations.  Let us take, for example, Article 3 (2
default)(
defaultb) which prohibits eugenic practices and is derived from the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.  What consideration was given to the effect of placing non-EU obligations such as this 
defaultin a Charter of EU fundamental rights
default? 
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: I do recall the debate.  Bearing in mind the genesis of the ECHR in the horrors of the Holocaust, there were certainly views that certain of the prohibitions that had been accepted as applicable in international law subsequently should be reflected.  Therefore, some of these came in for that reason.  But they are obligations that applied to the national states in any event.  I think you could ask the question—I cannot remember whether we did ask the question and what answer we gave ourselves—as to whether or not those have, in any event, become principles of international law that are binding in customary international law and, therefore, would have applied to the EU as well.  I hope that we would all take the view that, if the EU were suddenly to set up some laboratory for carrying out eugenic practices of that sort, we would want to know that there was something to stop them doing it.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ66 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Thornton:default These sort of non-EU ones were ones that would have been generally accepted anyway internationally, like eugenics law.
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: Yes, certainly.  I am not sure how many there are.  You have obviously found one. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ67 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Thornton:default That would be an exception rather than the rule?  
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: Would you permit me just to look at the explanations for a moment to see what we actually said about that?  That is the explanations as they were updated.  It is quite interesting that the President of our Convention was President Roman Herzog, who had been President of the German Constitutional Court and also President of Germany.  He—I hope he would not mind me saying so—for reasons which were understandable had some pretty strong views on some of these very basic issues, no doubt drawn a little bit from history.  Forgive me.  This is Article 2…
defaultMr Thornton:default That was Article 3(2
default)(
defaultb).
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: I am so sorry—thank you.  Yes.  I see there is a reference in the explanations to the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine, which had been adopted by the Council of Europe and all EU members of the Council of Europe in Protocol ETS no.  168.  There is also a reference to acts deemed to be international crimes in the statute of the International Criminal Court, to which all members of the EU had subscribed.  In any event, it is regarded generally as setting out principles of customary international law, insofar as it sets out prohibitions at least.  
defaultMr Thornton:default I notice under 
defaultTitle 1
default we also have prohibition of slavery and stuff like that.
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: That is ECHR.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ68 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Thornton:default Would you say these are mostly internationally accepted rights that would be generally accepted?
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: That is an ECHR prohibition.  So, essentially, the idea was that the most important single body of law setting out what the prohibitions were that generally apply to member states and ought to apply to the EU institutions was the European Convention on Human Rights.  There were other areas, too—some of them in EU law specifically and others in the general principles of international law.  We, as a Convention, determined which of those we thought were appropriate to be described as visible.  The point I am trying to emphasise is that none of them were rights that we created; they were all existing rights.  There was some discussion about 
defaultminting 
defaultnew rights, but we moved quite quickly to the position that we were not going to 
defaultmint
default new rights; we were going to make use of the existing rights.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ69 default&#xa0; 
defaultMichael Connarty:default We have touched on the attitude of President Herzog and his attempt to make this something that could be transferred into the treaties.  What difference would have to be made to that Charter to make it such a thing?  I am conscious that the comparison was made by one of our previous witnesses with the German Constitutional Court, notwithstanding the suggestion that was made in our last question to them.  How did he propose that the Charter could have been amended to make it a part of a binding treaty?  I remember the debate at the time.  
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: Historically, what happened was that I did not think at the time we were doing the negotiation we would end up saying it was legally binding.  Indeed, we did not; eventually it was declared in a solemn way.  But President Herzog said that we ought to draft it as if it was going to be legally binding, and that was a good legal principle to apply.  Getting everyone to follow that principle was much more difficult.  The political debate would sometimes be, “But this is a statement; this is a declaration.  So what is the problem?”  I think I irritated a lot of people by trying to focus in often on the detail of it.  
defaultI thought it was essential to have the horizontal articles and the explanations and to try to write the Charter as closely as possible to existing rights, and not to rewrite ECHR rights, even though it made modern sense.  The risk is that if you give a lawyer the same right described in two different ways, they will find a difference.  That is what I wanted to try to avoid.  
defaultWhen it came to making it legally binding, there were adjustments made to the horizontal articles and to the explanations.  I do not think there were any changes made to the substantive articles themselves.  I was not personally involved in that, but the horizontal articles and the explanations were changed in order to make it more fit to be part of a treaty.  Originally it was going to be the constitution
default, 
defaultand then it came into Lisbon.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ70 default&#xa0; 
defaultMichael Connarty:default You described it in an answer as a political statement.  You said at the time it was a political statement
default.  I recall interrogating Ministers; it was stated it was a political statement and that it was not, in fact, a binding new set of rules.  I want to quote to you from the question I asked the Prime Minister at the time.  It is in the evidence of 2 October 2007, when we had the European Minister at the time, the Member for East Renfrewshire, before us.  I asked the Prime Minister about what the red lines would be, and the first one he said was: “First, we will not accept a treaty that allows the charter of fundamental rights to change UK law in any way.”  Do you think that is still a tenable position given the recent comments in the UK courts? 
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: I think it is.  We had certain objectives, which were: no new rights and that we were not going to make social and economic rights 
defaultjusticiable
default except to the extent that we put them into law.  That was the slightly complicated principles thing.  I noticed some of the witnesses said that is a bit difficult to follow in the Charter.  That is a fair criticism, which is why I think Article 1(2) of the Protocol gets that right.  It really picks up on Title 4, which is about the socio-economic rights, which are the ones that really matter.  We did a good job in relation to that and it is still the case.  We did it against quite a lot of difficult opposition, because people wanted to go further and there was a lot of anxiety about it.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ71 default&#xa0; 
defaultMichael Connarty:default In the evidence we heard earlier, a word was used a few times, particularly by our academic colleagues.  The word “implementing” was to be judged as “within the scope of”, which seemed to extend the power of the Charter—the rights within the Charter.  Do you think that the use of “implementing” rather than “within the scope of” in Article 5(1) of the Charter reflects an intent to limit the scope of the ECJ’s rights of review, or is it to be read as consistent with the ECJ’s previous approach in reviewing EU measures on the basis of fundamental rights as a general principle of EU law?  
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: The ECJ has now in 
defaultFransson
default dealt with that debate—whether or not the words “implementing Union law” should have a narrow or a broader meaning.  They said that really it is the broader meaning.  I have seen evidence from the academics, of 
defaultwhom
default at least one has said, “I think that is right.” 
defaultAt the time of drafting, we were a little bit unsure in our own minds quite how that would work.  We wanted it to be focussed definitely on Union law.  I do not regard it as a problem that 
defaultFransson
default has given us somewhat the broad interpretation, because it is still a question of the application of EU law.  I look at it from the point of view of the protection of people against abuse of power, if Brussels is imposing 
defaulta 
defaulttax
default,
default you want them to be bound by rules that are fundamental protections for all of us.  Equally, if a member state is doing 
defaultit, that
default is what you want as well.  I am not sure, from that point of 
defaultview,
default it matters enormously if it is the narrow or the broad interpretation.  Either way, it is producing very important protections for the average individual.
default That is why I said, if you will forgive me saying so, in my written evidence that it seems illogical and paradoxical that people who are obviously concerned about potential overreach of power by Brussels—by the European Union—are complaining about a document whose very purpose is to constrain what Brussels does, not to extend it.  Everyone agrees that it does not extend what Brussels does.  That has been said about six times in different instruments.
default Could I just also say this?  You prefaced your previous question by saying, “See what the UK courts have said.”  If, with respect, that was a reference to 
defaultMr Justice 
defaultMostyn’s
default decision
default, with all respect to him, he got that wrong.  I have explained why I say he got that wrong in my written evidence, but others have said that as well.  I think even where he quotes from the 
defaultNS
default case, he quotes paragraph 120, whereas the paragraph that matters is paragraph 119, which has the ECJ saying that it does not create new rights.  As to the effect of Protocol 30, the Charter does have to be interpreted in accordance with the explanation.  If anything, that case does not suddenly show that this is all terrible; on the contrary, it is the ECJ saying that the Protocol does what it says on the tin.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ72 default&#xa0; 
defaultJacob Rees-Mogg:default Following on from that and your view that it does not extend the competence of the EU, it does include many rights that touch on areas beyond the EU’s competence.  What are the risks that this will inform EU policies or court decisions and thereby as a side-wind extend the EU’s competence? 
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: The EU’s competence ultimately can only be extended through the instrumentality of the member states, as I understand it.  Obviously, the EU has been a changing institution and, as a result, its powers have changed.  Each time that there is a new treaty or an intergovernmental conference, the likelihood is that people will be arguing for a 
defaultchange and a change in competences.  Sometimes people may think it is a very good thing that the EU is taking on certain additional competences in relation to fighting terrorism, for example; others may take a different view.  I do not think the Charter does it; it is the political dynamics of Europe that change the competences of the EU.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ73 default&#xa0; 
defaultJacob Rees-Mogg:default Do you think that court decisions under the Charter could extend the competence?  You are confident that is the case.
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: It says very clearly in the horizontal articles that it does not.  That was not a matter of controversy so far as the Convention members were concerned.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ74 default&#xa0; 
defaultJacob Rees-Mogg:default Could I go back to something Mr Connarty was asking you about regarding the Charter being drafted as a political declaration?  How differently would you have approached the negotiations in the Convention if the intention had been for the Charter to be a legally binding one from the outset?
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: I suppose I would have said, “If you are going to do this, you need to draft a longer document.”  In a sense, that is what I did.  People will not accept long documents for bills of rights.  What I was doing, therefore, was to say, “Let’s have a general statement of right, but let’s have a part B that is all the detail.”  That is what then 
defaultbecame the explanation
defaults
default.  I might have found it easier to argue some of these points if everyone had known that it was going to be legally binding, but I am not sure it would actually, at the end of the day, have made much difference.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ75 default&#xa0; 
defaultJacob Rees-Mogg:default Following on from that, you wrote for the 
defaultCommon Market Law Review
default in 2001, which you sent us with your evidence, where you said: 
default&#xa0;
default“My own view is that the political declaration route was the right approach.  There are two reasons for that.  First, it is easier in a political declaration to show a clear statement of values which people can understand without the 
defaultqualiﬁcations
default and exceptions necessary in a written law.  The second reason is that in the end I believe the Charter lacks the precision of language necessary to allow it legal force.  President Herzog wanted us to draft so that the Charter could be integrated into the Treaties if that was subsequently decided.  In this respect I believe we have not succeeded.  Even with the helpful commentary produced by the Presidium, the Charter will lack the precision necessary for a law.  So whilst it should be acceptable and valuable as a political statement, my own view is that this text is not suitable for incorporation into the Treaties whether directly or by cross-reference.”  
default&#xa0;
defaultDo you tell us now that the helpful commentary you referred to became the explanations for the Charter?
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: It did, but it was amended, and quite a lot of work was done negotiating.  One of the difficulties in getting everyone to sign up to the explanations was that the secretariat for the Convention did not want to ask—I may make a revelation here— member states to agree the explanations, no doubt because they thought it would be a very complicated process.  It was complicated enough as it was.  It was not a very popular thing that I had done, to create this second part.  We did not have that degree of consensus on it.  
defaultThe status of the explanations has changed from the commentary that was specifically described as non-binding to the position we now have in Article 6 following Lisbon and in Protocol 30.  The commentary has been given a very specific legal status, which is even stronger so far as the UK is concerned because of Protocol 30.  But it is still a strong legal status as far as other member states are concerned.  That was a very important part of the negotiations—the difficult negotiations—that took place at the time of the negotiation on the draft constitution.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ76 default&#xa0; 
defaultJacob Rees-Mogg:default Can I just clarify?  Do you think that the explanations have the same status as the Charter legally?  
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: No, the explanations are a tool for the interpretation of the Charter.  The dispositive provisions are in the Charter, if you will.  The explanations identify what those are, but they are now rather more than just a sort of commentary.  The wording of the preamble to Protocol 30 is that “
defaultArticle 6 requires the Charter to be applied and interpreted by the courts of Poland and of the United Kingdom strictly in accordance with the explanati
defaultons referred to in that Article”. I would say, “Well,
default that’s what Article 6 says,” though
default it does not actually use the word “strictly”.  There is a bit more there.  However, it gives them a much stronger legal effect than they had at the time of the Nice Declaration, because then it would have been said, “Oh, they’re just a commentary that has been published.”
default&#xa0;
defaultQ77 default&#xa0; 
defaultJacob Rees-Mogg:default To what extent can your concerns in 2001 about the lack of precision necessary for the Charter to become law have been overcome by making the explanations a binding interpretive tool and amending the horizontal articles?  Do you now move away from what you said in 2001?
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: You judge a situation, as a lawyer says, where you are.  This, broadly speaking, has worked.  I cannot rule out that there will be some area that gives rise to some interpretation I was not anticipating, but in relation to the big issues, for example, whether the rights corresponding to 
defaultthe 
defaultECHR are to be interpreted that same way as they would be by a court in Strasbourg and, therefore, now by our courts under the Human Rights Act, I believe that has succeeded.  
defaultAs I mentioned—I may not express it terribly well—in my written evidence, it is interesting to note that the point that gave rise to the reference in the 
defaultNS
default case, which included the question “Does the Charter do something differently?” was the fact that, at the time the
default case was referred by
default the UK
default court
default, the European court in Strasbourg had made an interpretation in relation to rights of extradition.  Some people thought it was too narrow and therefore wondered if the Charter could give a more generous interpretation.  This is explained by the Advocate General in her opinion.  What subsequently happened was that the European Court 
defaultof Human Rights I would say amended—they may say modified or developed—their understanding of what that right actually meant, so that you ended up with a situation where the reference would not have been necessary because nobody would have said that the Charter says anything different from the ECHR on that particular point.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ78 default&#xa0; 
defaultChris Kelly:default There is confusion among academics and practitioners alike about the meaning of Article 52 subsection 5.  Would you give us your explanation of its meaning, please?  
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: I underline, of course, that I am not speaking for the Government, in which I no longer have any role.  They may have different views about whatever this means.  What this was intended to do was to say there are, in this Charter, things that are not 
defaultjusticiable
default rights so let us call them principles, and those inform the way that the EU may legislate.  What the paragraph is trying to do is to say that they are not 
defaultjusticiable
default as they stand, but they may be implemented by legislative and executive acts.  When it comes to interpreting the acts that purport to implement them, then you can have a look at the general principles.  
defaultThe end result is that it is, in fact, expressed more happily in the Protocol by Article 1(2) simply saying that they are only 
defaultjusticiable
default rights to the extent that they are created in national law.  What we added in 52(5) was these words: “These shall be judicially cognisable only in the interpretation of such acts and in ruling on their legality.”  That means you can only have regard to the Charter in this area—the area of principles—when you are looking to see what the legislative act purporting to make that principle into binding law is, when you are interpreting that, or when you are ruling on its legality.
defaultIn other words, if you have a principle in relation to minimum wage, that does not mean there is a minimum wage.  But once states implement a minimum wage or if the EU were to implement a minimum wage, when it comes to interpreting what the legislation means when it says “minimum wage”, you can look at the principles in the provisions of the Charter to understand it, to interpret it and also to see whether it is lawful.  That was the intention.  Protocol Article 1(2) actually has a narrower effect as far as the UK is concerned because that is saying “in that field”.  If it is not implemented in the UK, it is not 
defaultjusticiable
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ79 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default What was the Government’s policy on the EU accession to the European Convention on Human Rights? 
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: I cannot fully recall.  We certainly had some discussion of it at the time that we were doing the Charter.  The Government had already signed up in Cologne to the setting up of the body, as it was then called—it then became a Convention—to set out these rights more visibly.  Accession to the ECHR would not have solved the whole of the problem, because it would not have dealt with any rights that did not derive from the ECHR.  As you rightly pointed out, there are quite a number that do not derive from the ECHR.  It is one of the errors that Mr Justice 
defaultMostyn
default made in thinking that the Charter was only dealing with the ECHR.  It is not; that is very clear.
defaultI cannot recall precisely what the policy was, but it would not have been an adequate solution to what was being done.  You might have argued, “Well, if you’ve got the ECHR rights in by an accession, you don’t need them in the Charter.”  But it would have been a very odd 
defaultCharter in those circumstances.  Evidence was taken on this, I recall, by the House of Lords scrutiny committee.  I know that they thought accession was one of things that should happen and ultimately it did.  The short answer is I cannot recall precisely what the policy was, but it would not have been an adequate solution to the issue we were faced with.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ80 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default On that point, did you personally think it was necessary for the EU to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights?
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: No, I did not.  Indeed, I could see a problem with that because then you do end up with two courts interpreting the same instruments, and that gives rise to potential difference.  We have seen that.  There have been one or two cases where the ECJ and the ECHR have reached different views.  I was not a particular proponent of it and I know we did quite a lot of work on what the implications would be.  I apologise that I cannot recall precise details.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ81 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default In relation to the Charter, the whole question turns ultimately on the fact or the law that, because it is within the framework of the Luxembourg court, for practical purposes it has implications in relation to sovereignty, which we were discussing with the professors and practitioners before you came in.  Therefore, it does have a relevance to the question of how you end up interpreting the impact of that Charter through Section 3 of the European Communities Act if the court—the European court—has made a decision and we then end up finding that we have got a position in which the European court has said one thing and an act of parliament has said another.
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: That, of course, happens, and I hope you are not going to ask me about prisoner voting rights, because that is obviously an area where that particular conflict arises.  I thought
default,
default if I may say so, that David Anderson put it well in his written evidence, or perhaps it was his oral evidence.  I noted that he said that one really ought to see that the Charter is not some sinister inroad into our sovereignty but is there particularly to provide protection against abuses by the European institutions against us.  That is how I see it.  I see it as a good thing.  I am glad that we did it.  I regret that Mr Justice 
defaultMostyn
default has raised a number of ha
defaultres
default—I do not blame him; it is a difficult area—by his misapplication.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ82 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default No one is in any serious doubt that there are constitutional implications if you end up in a position in which you have something adjudicated by the European Court of Justice in conflict with an act of parliament.  That is an important question, is it not? 
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: With respect, that does happen.  It happens with many international obligations that we assume.  It may turn out that the international obligations that we have assumed are in conflict with existing national laws.  So far as the European Convention is concerned, the Human Rights Act produced quite an elegant solution to that.  But the fact remains that, if there is a British act of parliament that says A and the Strasbourg court—never mind Luxembourg—says, “No, it’s not A; it’s B,” we are in breach of our international 
defaultobligation.  Prisoner voting rights demonstrates what the dynamics are about how those two positions get reconciled, if they do.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ83 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Moving to Article 52(3) of the Charter, can you explain what intention lies behind that Article?
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: The horizontal articles changed between the 
defaulttime
default that we drafted the Charter and when it was attached to the draft constitution.  I think that is how it came about.  In any event, I can tell you that the intention was to deal with an issue that some of us thought was significant: not to create a disconnect between what the ECHR required and what the Charter might be saying was applicable to the EU simply—“simply” is the wrong word because it is an important point—for the reason that I gave earlier.  You do not want to have the same right expressed differently in two instruments because that only encourages lawyers to say these differences are deliberate.  For example, let us consider Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which talks about privacy of correspondence.  At the time, in 1950, it made sense.  Today, of course, correspondence, if you interpreted that as meaning letters, would be wholly inadequate, so that was changed to “communications”. But that is actually what the European court in Strasbourg would say it means now in any event.  The point was to try to tie the statement of the corresponding ECHR right back to the ECHR and its jurisprudence.

defaultQ84 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Last year, in December 2013, the European Commission proposed a draft directive on the presumption of innocence to apply to criminal offences in the member states; in fact, we looked at it today in our earlier proceedings.  The standards that it sets are higher than those in the European Convention on Human Rights, with the effect that there will be two separate standards: one under the EU and the other under the ECHR law.  Was that the intention behind the last sentence of Article 52(3) of the Charter and do you think this is a positive development?
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: That last sentence was obviously deliberate, which is to say that the Charter established a floor, not a ceiling.  It is true, with respect, so far as the ECHR is concerned.  I believe that this country provides in a number of areas that are covered by the ECHR more extensive protections than the ECHR provides.  I regard that as a good thing.  But there is nothing inconsistent in saying, “You must be bound by these provisions but you can have more extensive protections if you want.”
default&#xa0;
defaultQ85 default&#xa0; 
defaultMichael Connarty:default I have been puzzling over this.  You described the Protocol as giving Poland and the UK additional safeguards.  In our original comment in the IGC report that we did, we said specifically: “
defaultIf, as the Foreign Secretary assured us, every part of the Charter is sourced back to exi
defaultsting rights ‘
defaultwith no right for the ECJ 
defaultor anyone to extend their reach’
default it is hard to se
defaulte why the Protocol is necessary,” etc.  You said it gave us an additional safeguard.  Can you give me an instance where the Charter has been used in any other country other than Poland and the UK to extend the rights?  In other words, has something happened outside?  
defaultWas it really necessary for Poland or the UK?  
defaultWas it not just more about comfort—for the political comfort—rather than safeguards?  
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: That is absolutely fair.  The Protocol came as quite a late development.  I am not sure I am at liberty to disclose how it came about, but it came on the cusp of the move from one Prime Minister to another, as it happened.  If I may direct your attention—I know you have got it.  I have looked at it.  I have tried to describe the Protocol in the address I gave to the British Institute of International and Comparative Law: “
defaultIn brief, the Charter Protocol is not an opt-out but a guarantee. 
default 
defaultAn explicit confirmation that in relation to the UK and UK law, the limitations and constraints on what it is and what it will do will be strictly observed
default.”
default  Was it necessary?  No, it was not necessary, so long as the Charter was interpreted in the right way.  I understand people want additional protections—bootstraps—to make sure there are safeguards.  That is the flavour.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ86 default&#xa0; 
defaultMichael Connarty:default That is what my analysis was coming to: that it was more of a comfort than a safeguard and we have not, in any way, been advantaged or disadvantaged against other countries by not having it. 
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: I do agree with that.  But subject to this limitation, if—this is what I was carrying on to say in the address—somebody 
defaultwere
default to say, “Well, that’s what you think the Charter means.  Actually, you’re wrong; it goes further,” then the Protocol is legally binding, so it would pull that back.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ87 default&#xa0; 
defaultMichael Connarty:default Just to have a clear record, can you list any concessions the UK has sought or achieved in return for agreeing that the Charter would become legally binding? 
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: If I may, that is a question probably better addressed—if you can—to the Government, I suppose.  My involvement was that I was the UK representative negotiating the Charter.  Subsequently, I became Attorney General.  As Attorney General, I gave advice on EU law, of course, but I was not responsible for negotiating.  I did not negotiate in 2004.  
defaultMichael Connarty:default The political deal.
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: I certainly did not negotiate that.  In 2004, I was not the person who negotiated the amendments to the explanations or the way it was going to be incorporated into the Treaty.  I did have an involvement in the Protocol. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ88 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I was going to ask that question myself.  It bears directly on what you have just said because we are interested to know who drafted Protocol 30.  Was it agreed by the Government as a matter of policy?
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: Who drafted it?  It was drafted by a combination of people within the UK Government.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ89 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default We had Mr Thomas, for example—Michael Connarty will remember—who gave evidence with David 
defaultMiliband
default, or was it with Jim Murphy?  The moment we got on to this subject, immediately the ball was passed to Mr Thomas, and we then had about 15 minutes with 
defaultthe Legal Adviser in the Foreign Office.  Basically, we are just trying to get a sense of who drafted it.  Was it a collective job and if it was, did it ultimately, for example, go in front of the legislation committee?  Was it then endorsed as a matter of Government policy that this was the way to go forward?
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: I cannot tell you how it was endorsed.  I told you that I personally had some involvement at a late stage in the drafting.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ90 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default We had rather an interesting moment of what I would not call truth, but it was certainly a moment of curiosity.  Just as Prime Minister Blair was about to leave office, in his last Prime Minister’s Questions he was asked the question about the Charter amongst other things, and he specifically stated that, on the Charter, we got an opt-out.  It was quite clear.  It is there in the transcript.  He resigned two days later.  I do not think it was to do with that.  Perhaps you can give the exact quote, Jacob.
default&#xa0;
defaultJacob Rees-Mogg:default He says, “It is absolutely clear that we have an opt-out from both the charter and judicial and home affairs.  Those were the reasons why people like the right honourable gentleman were saying that they wanted a referendum.”  So, because we had an opt-out from the Charter, we did not need a referendum.  It seems from your evidence that you are saying that Mr Blair’s view of the Charter is just as good as that of Mr Justice 
defaultMostyn’s
default. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: No, I am obviously not saying that.  The way that Mr Blair described it is for him to decide.  I would not have described it in those terms.  I did not describe it in those terms when I did come to describe it; I described it in different terms.  I can understand how in a common-sense, broad way one could say, “Well, it’s an opt-out,” because it means that we are protected and it cannot go any further than we are already bound by.  I can understand that entirely.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ91 default&#xa0; 
defaultJacob Rees-Mogg:default I think that is magnificently loyal after some years of leaving office, when all your evidence denies it is an opt-out. 
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: You may think that.  Genuinely, these are very difficult areas.  Your questions are very pointed, and absolutely rightly so.  These are very tricky areas, and sometimes I have seen politicians from both parties using language that is legally, in my view, inaccurate, but I understand entirely why that is done.  On the basic point, I do not regard it as an opt-out, and I have said that.
defaultChair:default You may be relieved to hear this is the last question.  Michael Connarty is going to be the one to ask it.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ92 default&#xa0; 
defaultMichael Connarty:default In your speech you referred to the British Institute of International and Comparative Law in 2008 you said, “Were the courts to disregard the clear provisions in the horizontal articles and explanations … 
defaultIn such remote circumstances the Protocol would indeed become an opt-out.
default”  Given recent statements and judgments, do you still believe these 
defaultcircumstances to be remote and in what way would the Protocol become more than a safeguard and an actual opt-out?
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: I am having some difficulty.  I am not sure I know what the recent circumstances are.  If the recent circumstances are Mr Justice 
defaultMostyn’s
default judgment or the case that he relies on, 
defaultNS
default, as I said, in paragraph 13 of his judgment he quotes paragraph 120 of the European Court of Justice’s judgment in 
defaultNS
default.  However, if I can draw attention to paragraph 119, which he does not quote, that deals specifically with the eff
defaultect of the Protocol and says
default:
default 
default“A
defaultccording to the third recital in the preamble
default to Protocol (No 30) 
defaultArticle 6
default 
defaultTEU 
defaultrequires the Charter 
defaultto be applied and interpreted by the courts of Poland and of the United Kingdom strictly in accordance with the explanations referred to in that article
default.
default”  In addition,
default ac
defaultcording to the sixth recital in the preamble the Charter 
defaultreaffirms the rights, freedoms and 
defaultprinciples recognised in the Union and makes
default those rights more visible, but does not create new rights or principles.
default  That is the ECJ speaking.  That essentially is the point I have been making.  The European Court of Justice has accepted that is the effect.  To some extent, they are relying on the Protocol to say that.
defaultMichael Connarty:default Given what we have observed in this Committee—I have been on it for 15 years and some Members have been on it for longer—regarding the competence creep of the European Commission, we had a few examples we gave to our witnesses in the session last Tuesday or Monday.  We gave them some examples where it seemed that competence creep was pushing laws that were to do with rights from the Commission’s directives—pushing in that direction.  The question is if they seem to be 
defaultdisregarding the provision of the horizontal articles and explanations, would the Protocol really become an opt-out?  Would it be strong enough?  
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: Maybe I was using language so as to—
defaultMichael Connarty:default I am not a lawyer I must add.  I am a politician and an economist.
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: At the time I gave this address, which was early in 2008, I had relatively recently
default stood down from Government.  With that address, I was trying to explain what had taken place.  There was a debate going on as to whether this was an opt-out and I thought it was important to say that it is not an opt-out but, nonetheless, to acknowledge that the Protocol could have legal effect.  In a sense, if properly interpreted that the Charter meant 
defaultx
default in relation to other member states, then so far as the UK is concerned, because of the Protocol, it would mean 
defaultx
default minus.  You can describe that as an opt-out at least from that piece—the difference between 
defaultx
default and 
defaultx
default minus.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ93 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I had thought we had finished, but there is just one last point of clarity.  To be clear, does Protocol 30 
defaultapply
default as much to other member states as it does to the UK and Poland?  In other words, it does not distinguish between the application of the Protocol for the UK and for Poland.
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Goldsmithdefault: My understanding is that it applies only to Poland and the UK.  It is not common, but there are protocols that do apply from time to time simply to particular members states.  This only applies to Poland and the United Kingdom.  If, of course—sorry 
defaultto complicate it—it does no more than the Charter does anyway, those aspects of the Charter will apply to all other member states as well.  The Government may take a different view, but my view is that Protocol 30 just applies to the UK and Poland.
default&#xa0;
defaultChair:default Thank you very much, Lord Goldsmith, for coming along, and that brings this particular session to an end.  Thank you very much.
