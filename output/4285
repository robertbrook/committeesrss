defaultI welcome the inquiry by the Select Committee into the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The focus of the inquiry is on Working Group I of the IPCC and its Fifth Assessment Report, neither of which is in my core areas of experience and expertise.
default I was a contributing author to IPCC WG1 AR3; I was a lead author in a few reports of WG2 and WG3; I am currently a convening lead author for WG2 AR5.
default I will therefore address only a few of the issues raised by the Select Committee.
default&#xa0;
default
default  How effective is AR
default5 and the summary for policymakers in conveying
default&#xa0;
default what is meant by uncertainty in scientific terms ? Would a focus on risk rather than uncertainty be useful? 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe agreed distinction between risk and uncertainty goes back to Knight (1921), with risk charact
defaulterized by known probabilities (the throw of a dice) and uncertainty by unknown probabilities. Climate change is better described by uncertainty than by risk. In other arenas the IPCC has tried to redefine widely accepted concepts (e.g., vulnerability) whic
defaulth has led to endless
default, fruitless
default discussions on semantics.
default It would be regrettable if the IPCC would repeat this mistake with regard to risk and uncertainty.
default&#xa0;
default
default  Do the AR5 Physical Science Basis report’s conclusions strengthen or weaken the economic case for action to prevent dangerous climate change? 
default&#xa0;
defaultIPCC WG1 AR5 is silent on this matter. The IPCC cannot make a case for action without violating its mandate; a
defaultnd if anything, such a case would follow from an assessment of the material in the reports of all three working groups. The IPCC cannot assess whether climate change is dangerous or not, because 
default“
defaultdanger
default”
default is a value-laden concept that, per Arrow (1962), can
defaultnot be defined for a society.
default&#xa0;
default
default  What implications do the IPCC’s conclusions in the AR5 Physical Science Basis report have for policy making both nationally and internationally? 
default&#xa0;
defaultNone. IPCC WG1 AR5 has added little to AR4 that would shift the established
default positions on climate policy, either nationally or internationally.
default&#xa0;
default
default  Is the IPCC process an effective mechanism for assessing scientific knowledge? Or has it focussed on providing a justification for political commitment? 
default&#xa0;
defaultNeither. The IPCC process 
defaultassesses scientific knowledge according to a political time-scale. That implies that parts of the literature are assessed too frequently while other parts of the literature are not assessed frequently enough.
default Instead of a mega-report every 6-7 years, it wo
defaultuld be better to have an IPCC Journal with frequent updates where the literature moves fast and infrequent updates where little new is written.
default&#xa0;
defaultPolitical positions are driven by power relations and the views of the electorate. The typical voter does not r
defaultead the IPCC reports, but only casts a glance at what some journalist made of the IPCC press release.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe IPCC reports do justify the existence of a large bureaucracy which, judging from the lack in progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and vulner
defaultability to climate change, seems primarily occupied with maintaining and expanding said bureaucracy.
default&#xa0;
default
default  Is the rate at which the UK Government intends to cut CO2 emissions appropriate in light of the findings of the IPCC AR5 Physical Science Basis report?
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultPer Weitzman (1972), the UK should set an appropriate trajectory for a carbon price, rather than for greenhouse gas emissions. If the UK chooses to persist in its mistake of emissions targets, 
defaultit should inform that decision with an assessment of the rep
defaultorts of all three working groups, and particularly WG3.
default&#xa0;
default
default  What relevance do the IPCC’s conclusions have in respect of the review of the fourth Carbon Budget?
defaultNone. At a stretch, IPCC WG1 AR5 may have something to say about a long-term global carbon 
defaultbudget. However, a decade of British emissions is very small relative to a century of global emissions.
defaultThe UK could be a leader in international climate policy if it would demonstrate that greenhouse gas emissions can be cut substantially without causing 
defaulteconomic pain. Current UK climate policy shows the opposite: Climate policy can cause real hardship without making a dent in emissions.
