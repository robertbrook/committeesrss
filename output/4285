[normal]I welcome the inquiry by the Select Committee into the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The focus of the inquiry is on Working Group I of the IPCC and its Fifth Assessment Report, neither of which is in my core areas of experience and expertise.
[normal] I was a contributing author to IPCC WG1 AR3; I was a lead author in a few reports of WG2 and WG3; I am currently a convening lead author for WG2 AR5.
[normal] I will therefore address only a few of the issues raised by the Select Committee.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]  How effective is AR
[normal]5 and the summary for policymakers in conveying
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] what is meant by uncertainty in scientific terms ? Would a focus on risk rather than uncertainty be useful? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The agreed distinction between risk and uncertainty goes back to Knight (1921), with risk charact
[normal]erized by known probabilities (the throw of a dice) and uncertainty by unknown probabilities. Climate change is better described by uncertainty than by risk. In other arenas the IPCC has tried to redefine widely accepted concepts (e.g., vulnerability) whic
[normal]h has led to endless
[normal], fruitless
[normal] discussions on semantics.
[normal] It would be regrettable if the IPCC would repeat this mistake with regard to risk and uncertainty.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]  Do the AR5 Physical Science Basis report’s conclusions strengthen or weaken the economic case for action to prevent dangerous climate change? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]IPCC WG1 AR5 is silent on this matter. The IPCC cannot make a case for action without violating its mandate; a
[normal]nd if anything, such a case would follow from an assessment of the material in the reports of all three working groups. The IPCC cannot assess whether climate change is dangerous or not, because 
[normal]“
[normal]danger
[normal]”
[normal] is a value-laden concept that, per Arrow (1962), can
[normal]not be defined for a society.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]  What implications do the IPCC’s conclusions in the AR5 Physical Science Basis report have for policy making both nationally and internationally? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]None. IPCC WG1 AR5 has added little to AR4 that would shift the established
[normal] positions on climate policy, either nationally or internationally.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]  Is the IPCC process an effective mechanism for assessing scientific knowledge? Or has it focussed on providing a justification for political commitment? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Neither. The IPCC process 
[normal]assesses scientific knowledge according to a political time-scale. That implies that parts of the literature are assessed too frequently while other parts of the literature are not assessed frequently enough.
[normal] Instead of a mega-report every 6-7 years, it wo
[normal]uld be better to have an IPCC Journal with frequent updates where the literature moves fast and infrequent updates where little new is written.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Political positions are driven by power relations and the views of the electorate. The typical voter does not r
[normal]ead the IPCC reports, but only casts a glance at what some journalist made of the IPCC press release.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The IPCC reports do justify the existence of a large bureaucracy which, judging from the lack in progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and vulner
[normal]ability to climate change, seems primarily occupied with maintaining and expanding said bureaucracy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]  Is the rate at which the UK Government intends to cut CO2 emissions appropriate in light of the findings of the IPCC AR5 Physical Science Basis report?
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Per Weitzman (1972), the UK should set an appropriate trajectory for a carbon price, rather than for greenhouse gas emissions. If the UK chooses to persist in its mistake of emissions targets, 
[normal]it should inform that decision with an assessment of the rep
[normal]orts of all three working groups, and particularly WG3.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]  What relevance do the IPCC’s conclusions have in respect of the review of the fourth Carbon Budget?
[normal]None. At a stretch, IPCC WG1 AR5 may have something to say about a long-term global carbon 
[normal]budget. However, a decade of British emissions is very small relative to a century of global emissions.
[normal]The UK could be a leader in international climate policy if it would demonstrate that greenhouse gas emissions can be cut substantially without causing 
[normal]economic pain. Current UK climate policy shows the opposite: Climate policy can cause real hardship without making a dent in emissions.
