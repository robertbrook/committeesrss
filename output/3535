defaultExecutive Summary
defaultThe aims of the UK 5 year AMR strategy 2008-2013 are logical and commendable. Recommendations and exploration of other non-chemotherapeutic antimicrobials (hereafter referred to as microbicidal products) to prevent the spread of resistant strains are not being fully considered.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe number of microbicidal products (i.e. products containing microbicides as defined by the Biocidal Product Regulation) and their applications has increased over the last 10 years. The EC is unable to provide data on the total amounts and types of microbicides and microbicidal products used within the European Union per year. Set against this however, in healthcare settings, usage of microbicidal products, particularly for environmental cleaning/disinfection, has declined in the last 50 or so years, apart from a few exceptions related to the control of 
defaultClostridium difficile
default and methicillin-resistant 
defaultStaphylococcus aureus 
default(MRSA).
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is now well accepted that not only the hands but also environmental surfaces (particularly contact surfaces) contribute significantly to the spread of infection both in hospital and out of hospital settings. By definition this means that these surfaces also contribute to the spread of AMR bacteria. Increased hand hygiene and surface decontamination compliance in healthcare settings has been linked to a decrease in infection rates. Since the routes of transmission, and the transmissibility of AMR bacteria are the same as those for non-AMR pathogens, the same control measures are appropriate to both. Measures to improve cleaning and microbicidal product compliance in both hospital and non-hospital settings and their application are needed. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOn the other hand there is measurable evidence that exposure to microbicides can lead to reduced sensitivity to antimicrobials in microbial populations. The use of microbicides and antimicrobial resistance has been highlighted in recent European documentation. Research and investment on the impact of microbicides on emerging AMR and the spread or maintenance of AMR genetic determinants is scarce. A number of questions about the sue of microbicidal products remain unanswered:

defaultAbout this group
default&#xa0;
defaultThis group of international scientists assembled because of common interests in translational issues about antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in relation to the use of microbicidal products. A publication from this group in the November 2013 Microbial Drug Resistance issue (attached), refers to the key literature, debates
default the increasing use of microbicides in consumer products and the raising concerns related to enhance microbicide resistance in bacteria and potential cross-resistance to 
defaultchemotherapeutic
default antimicrobials
default&#xa0;
defaultReasons for submitting evidence
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe written evidence submitted by this group focuses on the non-chemotherapeutic antimicrobials.
