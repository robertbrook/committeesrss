[[[Written submission from Imtech GH Ltd (BRC 70)]]]&#xa0;Since the introduction of Part P of the Building Regulations the industry has made great inroads in raising awareness of the requirements. This has helped to increase the standard for electrical installation work within dwellings. &#xa0;Unfortunately the enforcement bodies have not played their part in educating the homeowner as to the requirements and making it more difficult for the DIYâ€™ers and suchlike to operate. The scheme needs to be fully backed and promoted by the enforcement bodies and the industry. The current situation with different schemes and registers causes confusion and if anything may encourage potentially rogue contractors to look bona fide.&#xa0;In my view it is essential that the requirements of Part P are bought into the public domain and encouraged. They should also be publicised around the stockists of electrical installation materials so people understand their own limitations in this respect and the risk they take by breaching the requirements.&#xa0;As a business we test many hundreds of domestic installations annually and the issues we find during these inspections are quite frightening. The majority of these have been installed by the householder or a person claiming to be an electrician when they are clearly not competent for such works. This highlights the importance of having a scheme where all members are assessed to ensure they are and remain to be competent.&#xa0;&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
