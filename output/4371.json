"4\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from TravelWatch NorthWest (LTD0009)&#xa0;\n1. Introduction &#xa0;\n1.1 TravelWatch NorthWest (TWNW) is an independent Community Interest Company representing all public transport users in NW England. We are pleased to give our views as follows to this inquiry. \n&#xa0;\n2. What is the rationale for the Government’s proposals to devolve to a local level decision-making on transport expenditure? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Government’s approach? Are there better models?&#xa0;\n2.1 \nTWNW subscribes to the current all\n-\nparty consensus that transport funding should be \ndevolved to sub regional Combined Authorities (CAs)\n. \nCA’s boundaries are generally based on journey to work areas in large sub regional City wide conurbations.\n \nCare will be needed to ensure that their rural hinterlands are not neglected. There are histori\nc and more recent precedents supporting this model \n.\n&#xa0;\n2.2 \nThe \nLocal Democracy etc Act 2009 and the \nLocalism Act 2011 are surprisingly\n complementary with the former paving the way for new structures and the latter granting new powers and allowing the Secr\netary of State to “pass on” functions, such as determining transport and economic strategies. \n&#xa0;\n2.3 \nIn pursuit of localism the 2009 Act created \nstatutory Economic Prosperity Boards (EPBs) and the 2011 Act created \nvoluntary Local Enterprise Partnerships (LE\nPs).  Although a future government could abolish EPBs \n in favour of LEPS there appears in any case to be little enthusiasm in the North West for their creation primarily as a mechanism for forming Combined Authorities (CAs),  \n&#xa0;\n2.4 \nTWNW \nis\n not yet aware of the creation of any EPBs  but \nis\n aware of CAs being formed by the mechanism of Integrated Transport Authorities (Local Transport Act 2008) embracing other partners\n. Also CAs may themselves take on the function of an EPB\n.\n T\nhe creation of\n a CA is a step in the formation, by partnership with relevant LEPs, \nof Local Transport Bodies (Act 2009)\n&#xa0;\n2.5 \nEPB’s and LEP’s functions and boundaries are not necessarily co-terminal and TWNW \nis\n concerned that new sub regional groups of local authorities \ncould establish \nstatutory (Act 2009) EPBs in a manner that would override \nLEPs who are \nvoluntary non statutory Partnerships between local government and others\n.  \n&#xa0;\n2.6 \nMore clarity is needed in respect of the \nevolving roles of EPBs and LEPs, and especially the role of both in the context of the establishment of \nLocal Transport Bodies (LTBs). We are particularly concerned at the level of bureaucracy engendered by the establishment of non-elected LEPs and how they and LTBs relate to the established and experienced Local Transport Authorities.   &#xa0;\n2.7\n Overarching all this in the North is the recent decision on \nrail \nfranchi\nsing\n renewal and partnership \nannouncement between the \nDfT\n and \nRail\n \nNorth\n as a step towards devolution. We see devolving this responsibility to a more local level to be in the best interests of rail passengers provided that adequate funding is available to tackle the significant backlogs of rolling stock replacement and enhance\nment and to enable \nfull \ninvestment in the Rail Strategy for the North.   \n \n \n&#xa0;3. Do local bodies (including local authorities, local enterprise partnerships, passenger transport executives, integrated transport authorities and local transport boards) have the capacity to assess, prioritise and deliver local transport schemes? What would the optimum delivery body look like?&#xa0;3.1 \nThe new devolved structures [Act 2009], powers and functions [Act 2011] of both elected\n and unelected\n  bodies are bound to create demographic deficits and also a “churning” of staff and probably in the short term unavoidable \nskills shortages. However we are partially reassured by the general powers of wellbeing and competence [Act 2011] given to these bod\nies and to allow the Secretary of State to “pass on” functions as most appropriate. We would like to see these used to simplify the complex relationship between EPBs and LEPs whose boundaries and functions too rarely coincide.\n&#xa0;\n4. What is the best way of dealing with major transport schemes that cross local authority boundaries or have wider regional impact?&#xa0;4.1 \nThese may involve National agencies such as Network Rail and the Highways Agency, but they will also be funded from the EPBs’ Single Growth Fund (\nSLGF) which the LEPs will need to have already prioritised. A way will need to be found of resolving inevitable territorial, planning and financial discrepancies.  Whilst welcoming the capital in the Local Growth Fund\n  this comes at a time of growing reve\nnue budget challenges.\n&#xa0;\n5. How effectively do local bodies work with each other and with Government departments and national transport agencies?&#xa0;\n5.1 \nLocal transport bodies have a poor record of co-operation. Even duties such as section 88 Transport Act 19\n86 requiring transport, social services and education providers to co-operate \nwithin an authority\n are often observed mainly in the breach\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.2 \nWe are concerned that devolving powers to local government could result in \nconflicts (sometimes with transport e\nxpenditure consequences) between different tiers. This is currently manifest in the disagreement between the elected mayor of Liverpool and Merseytravel’s Integrated Transport Authority (and proposed Combined Authority) over the issue of the removal of the\n City’s bus lanes\n. \nIt would be possible (Act 2011) to legislate for the election of Combined Authority mayors, which could remove this obstacle.\n6. Do the current funding streams for major local transport schemes meet the needs of local authorities? How do current funding streams compare with previous arrangements?  What impact will the devolution in 2015 of funding to Local Transport Bodies and the introduction of the Single Local Growth Fund have?6.1 \nThese can be inadequate. TWNW sees the impact of devolving a Single Local Growth Fund to Local Transport Bodies (LTBs) being beneficial overall but only if its transport element is ring fenced and if\n Local Transport Bodies are given the ability to \nvire\n funds between capital and revenue. This is doubly important if the present Integrated Transport Block Grant is to be administered by LTBs.\n7. How can local authorities attract greater investment from the private sector for the delivery and maintenance of local transport infrastructure? What scope is there for the use of alternative funding streams? How clear are the lines of accountability for local decision making on transport expenditure?7.1 \nThere are\n encouraging signs of local authorities beginning to attract transport investment but TWNW would \nemphasise \nthat Local Transport Authorities, rather than appointed bodies such as LEPs, should be the accounting bodies. \n&#xa0;\n7.2 \nWhilst Greater Manchester Combine\nd Authority is a model for others to follow, it should also be noted that CAs must additionally resource other economic strategies which may or may not impinge on their transport remit.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n8.1 \nOverall the devolution to local level of much of \nthe expenditure incurred by local transport is welcomed\n.\n However t\nhe mechanisms for doing so are over complex \nand there is a real danger of too much bureaucracy. It is probably\n \n \nfortunate that \nEPBs have largely failed to materialise but \nthe relationships \nb\netween \nLEPs, CAs\n,\n LTBs \nand LTAs  \nare \ncomplex and \ndo not help the cause of devolution. \n&#xa0;\n8.2 \nEfforts will need to be made to repair the \ndepleted skills base of staff administering public transport and a more co-operative \nmodus operandi\n will be required.\n&#xa0;\n8.3 \nShould you wish TWNW to expand on this response, either in writing or verbally, we are prepared to do so.\n&#xa0;\n8.4 \nThank \nyou for the opportunity to respond\n&#xa0;\nDecember 20\n13\n &#xa0;\n Or where CAs not yet established, appropriate groupings of Local / integrated Transport Authorities\n \nRoyal Commission on Local Government\n Redcliff Maud 1966; \nTransport Act 1968\n; \nPt 5 of Local Transport Act 2008\n;\n No stone unturned / City Deals  \nHesletine \n2013\n respectively Labour (2008) and Coalition (2011)\n \nTime for a new Localism\n Centre for Cities May 2013\n up to a maximum of 50% of its membership\n The Association of Greater Manchester Authorities (AGMA), the first CA in England, selected this route \nin preference to the creation of a GMEPB \n LEPs are having passed to them some of the previous Regional Development Agency’s functions, including the prioritisation of expenditure on major transport schemes,\n \nHow can a LEP function where there is a paral\nlel EPB?\n  Local Government Chronicle April 2013\n Local Government, Local Transport Authorities, Integrated Transport Authorities, Passenger Transport Authorities/Executives and Combined Authorities\n Economic Prosperity Boards and Local Enterprise Partner\nships\n which LEPs will disburse\n"
