"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) \nrepresents \n18\n,000 heads, principals, deputies, vice-principals, assistant heads, business managers and other senior staff of \nmaintained\n and independent schools and colleges throughout the UK. ASCL has members in more than 90 per cent of secondary schools and colleges o\nf all types, responsible for the education of more than four million young people. This places the association in a unique position to consider this issue from the viewpoint of the leaders of secondary schools and of colleges.\n2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nASCL welcomes this inquiry as\n a timely opportunity for much needed reflection on these policies.\n3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nASCL has never opposed the idea of academy schools\n, and the majority of ASCL members now lead academies. \nASCL members also lead\n the majority of colleges (FE and sixth f\norm) and independents schools affiliated with HMC, GSA and the Society of Heads, the situations of which are in many ways similar t\no\n that of academies.\n4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nASCL has always argued in favour of subsidiarity: decisions being made at the ‘lowest’ level possible co\nnsistent with efficient use of resources. This implies a greater degree of autonomy than schools have traditionally enjoyed, even after the introduction of local management of schools in the 1990s.\n5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMost ASCL members value extra freedom for them and their g\novernors to make decisions in the interests of their students\n. In the view of ASCL they are better placed \nthan either local or central government \nto make such decisions. When policies are made remotely, and by officials however intelligent and well-meaning\n who do not have to operate them on a daily basis with real children, they often result in waste and poor outcomes.\n6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe academy project has on the whole been successful in the sense that the majority of schools in the secondary sector ar\ne now academies. An\nd b\necoming an academy has helped some schools to \nmake \nsignificant improvement\ns\n. But by no means\n all academies have been successful, nor have all the successful maintained schools \nchosen to become academies. The picture is very complex, and \nvery different \ni\nn different parts of the country\n.\n&#xa0;\n7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhile ASCL is generally positive about \nacademies t\nhere are\n \na number of contrary \nor complicating \nfactors which should be taken into account when considering the academy project in detail: \n8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhile many \nschool \nleaders\n have been content for their schools to leave local authority ownership, a significant minority, whose local authorities are more effective and supportive, have resisted this.\n Many, supported by their governors and local communities, continue to do \nso.\n9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNote the caveat\n in paragraph \n4\n above\n; there are some issues that do require regulation\n,\n or decisions \nthat are binding over a wider area\n, if there is not to be w\nasteful duplication, gaps in provision, bad practice driving out good, and a lack of coherence in the public service.\n10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is a danger of atomisation, with \nthe most vulnerable young people being lost, along with \nthe concept of a public education service\n,\n \nin a welter of competing schools. The great majority of school leaders do not want that and continue exercise system leadership, both individually by working outside their own institution more or less formally, and via the policies they steer their \nschool \nor \nacademy towards.\n11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nASCL has long encouraged partnership between schools and colleges of all kinds, and continues to do so. \nThis can help to recreate a sense of wider community and commitment to the best education for all. \nIn our experience this is most \neffective when entered into freely as a ‘bottom up’ initiative\n, which of course is more likely when schools have greater autonomy\n. There is no reason why \npartnership working \nshould \nnot continue in the academy era, but if it is to be as effective and widesp\nread as it can be \nneither \nregulation\n nor \naccountability systems\n should \ndiscourage it\n, as they often do now\n.\n12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLeaders in schools of all kinds see themselves as primarily accountable to the children that attend the school and their parents. That is right, but\n there is also a need to account for the use of public funds, and to \ntake responsibility for the loc\nal education system as a whole.\n13\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are also many open questions about who should decide if intervention is needed in a failing academy, how such decision\ns can be made, and what support can then be made available. See the discussion of a possible ‘middle tier’ in paragraphs \n18\nand \n19\n below.\n&#xa0;\n14\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhile the concept of academy schools has been welcomed by a majority of school leaders, there has been concern about \nhow \nthe change to academy status takes place. Those sc\nhools that freely chose to become academies, ‘converter academies’, \nare generally content, many of those \nschools \nthat had, or felt they had, no choice are less so. \n15\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nASCL would strongly urge that decisions \nabout change of school status \nsho\nuld be taken by sc\nhool governing bodies\n, and not under duress. The drive to move schools to academy status has become a policy imperative, and there have been cases of the DfE effectively forcing schools to become academies. This has especially applied to schools in more challenging areas (‘con\nstrained schools’) that have failed to reach arbitrary floor targets. Other routes to improving schools in such situations have worked \nwell \nin some instances and \nwhen favoured locally \nshould be given more consideration.\n&#xa0;\n16\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSome sponsors, especia\nlly when schools have had little or no choice of sponsor, have added no value while taking funds from the school budget, and in a few cases have imposed eccentric ideas of their own with little regard to educational thinking or educational values. There is\n a need to impose stricter conditions on what organisations can become sponsors. On the whole, the system has worked best when sponsors have been other educational institutions (other schools, colleges, universities).\n17\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nASCL would urge that school governing \nbodies should decide whether on becoming an academy their school should have a sponsor, and choose the sponsor if there is to be one.\n18\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs the majority of secondary schools are now academies, and more are following suit\n,\n there is a question about the capacit\ny of the DfE and the EFA to support and fund them. It is generally accepted that it is not good practice to run significant numbers of local organisations directly from Whitehall. That raises a question of what types of organisation should be put in place \n(either by government or by the schools themselves) to be a ‘middle tier’ between national government and individual academies.\n19\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is a danger that these ch\nanges will effectively remove local authoritie\ns from education\n, not replace them,\n and \nso \nactually\n centralise the system. The Secretary of State for \nEducation \nneeds to adopt a self-denying ordinance to prevent himself (and so far as possible his successors) from interference in decisions that should be better taken at lower levels.\n20\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are still some\n uncertainties about the regulations under which academies work. For example, the question of who is the employer of staff in a school should be clear, it should be the governing body, but some trades unions are continuing to take national action in such s\nchools in dispute with the Secretary of State.\n21\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe regulation\n, accountability and funding\n of academies and schools of other kinds (and so\n far as possible colleges) need\n to be brought into better alignment. There remain a number of anomalies.\n&#xa0;\n22\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAgain \nASCL does not oppose \nchains \nper se\n, and some are working well. However, some have imposed great restriction on local decision-making, making the governing body, head teacher and other leaders follow a ‘formula’\n,\n or imposing policies decided by the chain. T\nhis works against the principle of subsidiarity, leaves local leadership in some cases with less freedom than when \nmaintain\ned by a local authority, and raises questions about the accountability of chains.\n23\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSome chains have blocked local partnership working \nby requiring their schools to partner only with other members of the chain, often at a distance. In some cases this has prevented potentially valuable local partnerships from forming at all.\n24\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOn the whole it is the smaller chains, and those with a more loca\nl focus, that are seen as of value by local school leaders of the academies that make them up. Those that are larger and have schools in widely separated locations are seen as more controlling, less supportive and less accountable.\n25\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is a place for cha\nins of academies, but ASCL would not see them as the norm, or the answer to the ‘middle tier’ question.\n&#xa0;\n26\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAgain ASCL does not oppose the idea of free schools as such. At present\n,\n once a free school is established it becomes an academy like any \nother. \nThere are many issues, however, about the way that the free schools policy has been promoted, the way free schools have come into being, and the lack of planning or sufficiently effective regulation.\n27\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe key issue is how free schools are agreed. The\nre has been little attempt so far to consider the effect of setting up a free school in a locality on the schools that already serve it, and on the local education system as a whole. Where there is a shortage of places setting up a free school might well b\ne a sensible move, but where there is a surplus of places consideration should be given to diseconomies of scale. \nI\nf the establishment of a free school leads to other schools closing there will be expensive public buildings surplus to requirement. And\n,\n \nmos\nt importantly\n,\n \nyoung people will certainly suffer while such a shaking out is taking place.\n28\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe free school policy has undermined attempts to plan school places. \nIt is accepted that f\nor there to be parental choice there must be some surplus\n places, but these surplus places are expensive, and a charge upon the public purse. They therefore need to be as few as compatible with reasonable choice, but in some cases free schools have been agreed in areas that already have a \nlarge \nsurplus of places\n.\n29\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is a great deal of resentment amongst school leaders of existing schools of all kinds about the favourable funding that free schools have received. Significant capital sums have been devoted to setting up new schools, when in some cases those nearb\ny have a longstanding unmet need for capital spending to make their buildings fit for purpose.\n30\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLikewise, revenue funding of free schools to planned numbers\n when their places have often not been filled has meant their pupils being funded at higher rates than in nearby schools struggling with very tight budgets. A period of austerity is not a good time for such an experiment.\n There is a need to quickly bring f\nree school funding into alignment with a fair funding formula that we hope to see for all publicly funded schools.\n31\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEven more than for academy sponsors, much greater ‘vetting’ of free school sponsors is required. There have already been instances of free sc\nhools being set up for reasons that have little to do with education by groups that not only lack educational expertise but make no effort to acquire any. Such schools will fail, and will damage children’s education and life chances while doing so.\n32\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSome fr\nee schools will no doubt succeed, and join the family of schools in their area. Their leaders are also mostly ASCL members. Such schools will in a few years be little different\n from the academies around them.\n&#xa0;\n33\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI hope that this is of value to your inquiry, \nASCL is willing to be further consulted and to assist in any way that it can.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
