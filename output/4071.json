"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the City of London Corporation (CYS 0067)&#xa0;&#xa0;This letter responds to the recent invitation to submit written evidence to the above inquiry. \n The City has witnessed a huge growth in the number of cyclists passing through the Square Mile and \nthe widespread\n concern about the number of recent fatalities in Central London is shared by the City Corporation. \n&#xa0;\nThe City is engaged in a number of initi\natives in the Square Mile aimed at promoting cycle safety. As in the rest of London, a large proportion of accidents in the City involve cyclist collisions with Heavy Goods Vehicles turning left. Operation Atrium, which is run jointly by the City’s Road Sa\nfety Team and the City of London Police,\n aim\ns\n \nto address this problem. \nIts primary objective is to reduce casualties among vulnerable road users – particularly cyclists – by raising awareness of potential hazards and promoting measures that can be taken to\n reduce risk, such as cycle training. The campaign is coupled with enforcement activity against traffic offences such as motor vehicle encroachment into cyclist advanced stop boxes, red light running and pavement cycling. \nThe project includes a number of\n e\nlement\ns to educate cyclists and HGV \ndrivers\n about potential hazards, including ‘Exchanging Places’, where \ncyclist\ns\n who ha\nve\n been \nfined\n for unsafe cycling\n are taken on an HGV to\n ex\nperience the view of the road from the perspective of the driver. Cyclists wh\no attend have their fines\n cancelled.\n The City’s own fleet vehicles have been fitted with sensors that can alert the driver to the presence of a cyclist in the driver’s blind spot.  \n&#xa0;\nAdditionally, the City is running roadside campaigns targeted on accident\n hotspots to promote safe road use. Information on cycle safety is handed out together with equipment such as high visibility clothing for cyclists and Fresnel lenses that enhance HGV drivers’ awareness of the areas around their vehicles. Extra cycle safet\ny education is provided through monthly presentations \nin local businesses\n, and at primary schools in the City through the \nBikeability\n programme. \n&#xa0;\nChanges to the City’s roads are also\n being made to\n improv\ne\n cycle safety. The City recently adopt\ned a 20mph sp\need limit on all\n its roads, excluding those run by \nTfL\n (over which the city does not have jurisdiction\n. Work is also being \nundertaken\n to change the layout of the roads and markings to encourage safer behaviour on the part of cyclists and motorists.   \n&#xa0;\nI \nhope this background is useful and if you have any further questions on this issue, please do get in touch.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
