[[[Royal Town Planning Institute]]]

[[[Introduction]]]

[[[ ]]]The Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI) is pleased to respond to the call for written evidence to the Environmental Audit Committee Inquiry to examine the Code for Sustainable Homes and the Housing Standards Review.The RTPI is the largest professional institute for planners in Europe, representing some 23,000 spatial planners. The Institute seeks to advance the science and art of spatial planning for the benefit of the public. As well as promoting spatial planning, the RTPI develops and shapes policy affecting the built environment, works to raise professional standards and supports members through continuous education, training and development.The views in this submission follow consultation with the members of the RTPI, and specifically the members of the English Policy Panel. This Panel has a varied membership with experts in the full range of planning policy fields represented.

[[[Submission ]]]1.1              We support the simplification and rationalisation of standards – the Taylor Review of Planning Guidance has shown what can be achieved and the potential benefits. However, if the objective of clarity is to be delivered, rather than additional confusion from poorly focused and uncoordinated change, the RTPI believes that more work is required.1.2               A good indication of the additional work required is given by the Challenge Panel in ‘Towards more Sustainable Homes’.1.3               The RTPI believes that the Government should set down a clear, timetabled and aspirational plan for housing standards, in particular showing how the ‘zero carbon by 2016’ commitment is to be delivered by all parties and showing which elements of the Code for Sustainable Homes are being dropped – if any. 1.4              With the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) including a ‘presumption in favour of sustainable development’ it would seem a perverse and retrograde to act in any way to compromise overall sustainability objectives.

[[[The Role of the Building Regulations]]]2.1              It is the RTPI’s view that the Government should move immediately to update and amend the Building Regulations rather than ask that, generally overstretched and under-resourced, Local Planning Authorities (LPAs) should institute Local Plan reviews to justify and incorporate standards as a merely interim measure. 2.2              It is inevitable that LPA positions on standards will be even less predictable in this interim period whereas builders broadly know where they stand at the present. It is notable and concerning that the public sector costs of implementing two changes – through Local Plans and then the Building Regulations – have not been assessed.2.3              If the review process for updating and incorporating additions to the Building Regulations is not fit for purpose ie it is too slow and/or unwieldy as is implied by the Review document, then this deficiency must be addressed to provide the assurance required by local authorities who will be foregoing the potential to innovate with standards as changed expectations are identified.

[[[Eco-friendly Standards]]]3.1              The RTPI is concerned that too little attention has been given to the potential for higher standards to be justified and marketed on the basis of the significant user savings achievable. 3.2              In particular there is potential for lenders to incorporate more explicitly the savings as an incentive mechanism into their loan-to-income evaluations for lending.

[[[Aspirational]]]

[[[ Standards]]]4.1              It is noted from the Impact Assessment that, “Based on discussions with local authorities and other partners, we have estimated that around 90% of new homes in London are built to the Lifetime Homes standard and 5% outside of London”. &#xa0;This seems to indicate that where ‘headroom’ exists in the pricing of housing, so-called aspirational standards are adopted and welcomed. 4.2              Therefore, as it would appear that we are entering another period of increasing house prices, to be matched by increases in supply, it is all the more important that the pathway to raising standards to an equal level across England is &#xa0;set out now and mechanisms set in motion.4 October 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
