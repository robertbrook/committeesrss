[normal]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1
[normal]              
[normal]The British Retail Consortium (BRC) is the trade as
[normal]sociation of the retail sector.
[normal] The BRC brings together the whole range of retailers across the UK, from independents to large multiples and department stores, selling a wide selection of products through centre of town, out of town, rural and online stores.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our membership includes 
[normal]all the major food retailers, who between them account for over 90% of 
[normal]the UK
[normal]’s grocery sales. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Food security is a fundamental issue for our members. As responsible, forward looking businesses, they know only sustainable supply chains that meet the challenges of an increasing and more affluent global population and climate change will ensure they meet future UK consumer demand. It is a business imperative to invest in supply chains today to secure future supplies.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]This submission focuses on the following key points 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.0[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Sourcing in a Global Market[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The competition for food to feed a growing global population of 7 billion and increased affluence in countries such as China and India is a major factor influencing the UK’s food security. This is already demonstrated by the impact of global commodity prices have on UK food prices, regardless of production in this country.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Trade is an important part of food security building robustness to shocks and reducing risk. Food exports are an important part of our balance of trade. However we believe it is important to ensure the correct balance between imports and home production. The majority of  food in our supply chain is sourced in the UK and most of the remainder from within the EU, meaning our supply chains remain relatively locally based. What is changing is how 
[normal]consumption in other parts of the world is influencing the availability of key inputs such as animal feed and the price of food, regardless of where it is sourced. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Commodities such as wheat, soy
[normal]a
[normal] and maize are easily and widely traded around the world. It is the world market that sets the price not local ones
[normal],
[normal] as a farmer in the UK can just as easily export his wheat, for example, as sell here and, therefore, with a minor adjustment for transport costs, the world price prevails here. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4 Although the UK is a highly efficient agricultural producer, we remain small in global terms and some commodities, such as soya, which is key to high protein animal feed, are not produced here. That means harvests in larger agriculture producing countries such as Brazil and USA have a bigger impact on supply and prices than harvests here in the UK. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5 All this means UK food companies are beholden to the global market. Whilst this is unlikely to affect food security, as we remain a wealthy market able to compete financially with other countries for food, it does mean there are likely to be pressures on food prices. These pressures are exacerbated by the inevitability of more variable global harvests due to erratic weather as a consequence of climate change. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6 The point about growing demand for food and subsequent changing diets to meet the demands of more affluent consumers is also very relevant. An increase in the consumption of meat and dairy products due to changing diets has an influence on our prices here. Many dairy products, such as skimmed milk powder, cheese and butter, are tradable commodities and changes in the global market will influence the prices for those products in the UK, and by extension the price dairy farmers receive for their milk. 
[normal]There is less influence on highly perishable products that are difficult to trade
[normal],
[normal] such as liquid milk, soft fruit and egg
[normal]s where the market is more localised to the UK.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.7 Operating in a global market also has consequences for farmers, as it can be the key factor influencing the price they receive, which is independent to the cost of production. For example, a bumper global wheat harvest could mean a significant drop in the price despite the fact that costs of production in the UK may have risen. This could also be the case in dairy, where only half of our production is used for liquid milk and the remainder for products such as cheese which are susceptible to global prices. If the price of those dairy commodities drops it will influence the price paid to many dairy farmers regardless of the cost of production.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.8 Within their own supply chains, particularly on perishable products, retailers have constructed arrangements which provide farmers with more certainty on prices but these have tended to be those not as influenced by global prices; for example, many retailers are using a cost of production of model for their suppliers of liquid milk, recognising it is important to ensure those farmers have sufficient profit to reinvest in their business to continue to supply them in the future. However, as retailers do not buy all UK agricultural produce and have a more distant relationship with some farmers, such as cereal producers, their intervention will only benefit a proportion of UK farmers. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.0[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Ensuring Food Security[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Improving food security is central to the business of all food retailers. Whilst Government, particularly at the EU level, can influence the policy and regulatory environment that affects food security, ultimately the responsibility for delivery of food security falls on food companies who want to continue to operate in the market in the long term. Our members know that they need to secure supplies into the future to keep products on the shelf and meet consumer demand. If they don’t that business will be lost to the companies that are able to do so.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Of course, retailers already ensure food security, coping with issues such as bad weather and supply chain disruptions to ensure safe, nutritious, affordable food is on the shelves. Their investment in their businesses and supply chains ensures this will remain the case in the long term. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The two main ways our members are: improving food security is consolidating their relationships with their suppliers by working closer with them to establish long term partnerships that are robust to cope with future challenges; and helping the supply chain and, importantly, consumers to reduce waste.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Working with suppliers to build long term partnerships makes good business sense for retailers.  In a global market with rising population and diminishing resources, suppliers will have more choice of where to sell their products, and investment today to form a strong partnership will ensure consistent supply in the future. The easiest place to build and maintain strong relationships is the UK and that is where our members source the majority of their food. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Stronger partnerships ensure closer and more effective collaboration through the chain to tackle future challenges. Arrangements such as producer groups and dedicated supply chains have positive benefits for food security. They make it easier for retailers to pass more of the price through the chain to the farmer to ensure long term investment and also provide a direct route to disseminate advice on improving production in terms of reducing energy and water use and cutting waste. Ensuring more efficient, profitable production alsoreduces the use of resources, reduces the factors influencing climate change and helps adaptation to climate change. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Retailers are investing in their supply chains, both in the UK and abroad
[normal],
[normal] to make them more robust by cutting emissions and helping producers adapt to climate change. They have commissioned research on reducing energy, water and waste which they have shared in a practical manner with producers
[normal].  
[normal]In addition, r
[normal]etailers are key members of WRAP’s Product Sustainability Forum (
[normal]PSF
[normal]), which has 
[normal]identified 
[normal]the
[normal] ‘top 50’ grocery products estimated to account for approximately 80% of the greenhouse gas emissions associated with producing, transporting and retailing grocery products consumed in the UK.  This will enable retailers and others to prioritise their efforts on those products with the most potential for improvement. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Unlike most other EU member states, t
[normal]he UK 
[normal]now 
[normal]has a good understanding of the amount and type of food waste produced each year 
[normal]and opportunities to reduce this waste.  UK grocery retailers 
[normal]are actively involved in helping cut
[normal] food and drink
[normal] waste both through the supply chain and in households. Cutting waste has rightly been identified as one of the most effective ways to improve food security. All the major retailers have agreed targets with the UK Governments through the Courtauld 
[normal]Commitment
[normal] to cut waste
[normal].  Retailers 
[normal]have shown they are delivering
[normal], while 
[normal]recognising that more needs to be done, particularly in 
[normal]encouraging consumers to cut their waste and helping farmers to maximise their production. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Government can play a role in improving food security by ensuring the optimum environment for delivery than delivery itself.. We also need to accept that the global market means there are more appropriate issues for Government to influence at a European or UK level. The EU, for example, is better place to consider the structural issues of food security as it has competence for trade agreements, the CAP and legislation on bio-technology. However, we feel more co-ordination is needed to bring these policy areas together in a coherent fashion to address food security. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.9
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Where the UK Governments can help is by supporting coherent campaigns on food waste and using fora such as the Product Sustainability Forum, convened by WRAP, to disseminate best practice on reducing resource use to a wider group of stakeholders. It is disappointing, therefore, on the first point that Defra has decided not to prioritise funding for WRAP which has been central to co-ordinating the effective reduction of food waste, particularly with householders.  It is also of concern that Defra sees 
[normal]the responsibility for taking work forward 
[normal]on food waste as resting 
[normal]largely 
[normal]with the industries concerned.
[normal]  While industry has a clear role to play, industry alone cannot achieve the cultural shift needed to reduce household food waste and patterns of food consumption.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.10
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Government also has a responsibility to check that retailers and other food companies are taking adequate steps to deliver food security. We have a regular dialogue with Defra on short term issues through its Food Chain Emergency Liaison Group and through other discussions on sustainable supply chains and climate change adaptation. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.11
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Government should also be aware of unintended consequences of regulation on food security. Regulations on imports, for example, can have an impact. For example, there is a risk to some commodities that are imported into the EU where EU regulations on GM do not keep pace with approval for new crops elsewhere in the world. Even minor contamination by non approved GMOs will lead to the rejection of bulk loads of crops and an importer may consider it less risky to send the product to another country that has a less restrictive policy. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.0[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Supply Chain Resilience[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Retailers know the resilience of their supply chains relies on the robustness of all the links within it. They work closely with their suppliers to ensure resilience to tackle both immediate and future issues, accounting for factors such as climate change and attempts to supply adulterated food.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Supply chain controls are extremely effective in delivering safe food through rigorous inspection, auditing and testing of food in the chain. However, the recent horsemeat incident highlighted the need to deal with attempts to deliberately defraud the system which seek to circumvent normal controls. Following this, retailers have increased their own inspections of the whole supply chain rather than relying on assurances from suppliers, and re-examined how they target testing and share intelligence. We have also encouraged the UK Government to set up a more effective mechanism for exchanging intelligence across European food authorities to identify risks more effectively. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Retailers recognise the importance of ensuring their supply chains adapt to climate change. They have mapped their chains to identify what climate change will mean for their current sourcing policy and planned adjustments to cope with any future shortfall in supply. They are working with suppliers to help them cope with climate change, for example facilitating the use of trickle irrigation in countries where water shortages are more likely. They have also examined the impact of increased flooding on their buildings and their distribution networks to reduce interruptions to supply in the future.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Through these measures retailers have helped suppliers to reduce the impact of their production, such as cutting water and energy use. It will also help suppliers be more financially resilient in the future. It is likely that water, energy and waste disposal will be more expensive in the future and improvements made today will make production more efficient and cheaper in the future. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Responding to the problems of sourcing in the global market retailers have collaborated to build sufficient scale to safeguard future supplies. For example, UK retailers understand the importance of using sustainable palm oil to secure a valuable resource that mitigates the risk of deforestation of primary rain forest. However, to give a sufficient market signal to producers for this type of production they have had to work with other retailers in Europe and beyond to demonstrate sufficient commercial demand. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.0[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]New Technology[bold]&#xa0;[bold]5.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We believe science and technology, as it always has, will help to improve food security. However, as we are driven by consumers, it is important that the use of technology is acceptable to them. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]New technology could certainly play its part in reducing waste. Nano packaging, that prolongs the shelf life of products or indicates when a product is about to exceed it, will help consumers manage food better and help prevent waste in the house. Improved forecasting and modelling will also help retailers ordering fresh produce to reduce waste at the farm level and provide reliable predictions of demand. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Continuing advances in agri-science will also help to increase the efficiency of farms, reduce their impact on the environment and cope with climate change. This covers everything from better utilisation of water and nutrients to changes to feed regimes that help reduce emissions and improve waste management. The key will be ensuring the dissemination of improved practices and the take up of these by farmers. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The use of GM is a more complex issue for UK food security. UK retailers do not currently sell GM food as there is no consumer demand. Consumers are yet to be convinced of the benefits to them of GM. The current arguments justifying the use of GM as a method for improving sustainable production are not relevant to the bulk of consumers. It remains possible, currently at least, to import dedicated non GM supplies of products to maintain this approach. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]GM commodities such as soya and maize are, however, key to our supply of animal feeds. They provide important sources of protein in the diet to ensure efficient production of animals. It is virtually impossible to obtain non GM soya in sufficient quantities to meet the demand in the EU. As this is imported from outside the EU, the GM soya needs to be approved for use here. As GM 
[normal]varieties increase abroad, it is important the EU approval process keeps pace, as disruption to the import of these commodities would have significant impact on our ability to produce commercial pigs and poultry in the UK. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.0[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]UK Producers[bold]&#xa0;[bold]6.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our members’ supply chains are built on UK production, the vast majority of the food they sell is produced here. It makes good sense for food security as this ensures easier collaboration in shorter chains, lowers some of the risks of disruption, and uses quality produce from a highly efficient sector experienced in meeting the demands of the UK consumer.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Retailers invest in their UK supply chains to ensure all the benefits listed above are maintained in the future. Some of that investment in commissioning research to identify practical ways to reduce resource use should help farmers be more efficient and produce more for less, helping us to be self-sufficient. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We also believe there are some areas where there is demand for UK production and self-sufficiency could be improved if we can find the appropriate balance between protection of the environment and new rural development. A good example is chicken production. Although virtually all fresh chicken for retailers is sourced here, there is continued interest for more, both for retailers’ processed products and from other food sectors. The problem is meeting that demand which means more development to provide increased capacity. Similarly, where producers have attempted to extend seasons by using polytunnels there have been issues in terms of the balance of development against protection for the environment. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In terms of smaller UK producers, we believe there is every opportunity for them to supply major retailers. In fact, one of the factors that continues to resonate with customers is local sourcing. All major retailers have teams to identify new products for customers and they work with their suppliers to help them meet any logistical challenges. Further to this, the BRC has worked with other food bodies to establish the Safe and Local Supplier Approval (SALSA) scheme to help smaller companies meet the food safety requirements to supply a larger food company.
