"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by BBC Media Action\nExecutive Summary: This paper\n is \nwritten \nin response to the\n \ndecision by the \nInternational \nDevelopment \nCommittee\n of the UK \nParliament\n to undertake an inquiry into DFID’s work in the Middle East\n and specifically “the \neffectiveness of DFID’s programme in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.” \nTh\ne p\naper concentrates on BBC Media Action’s experiences in the Occupied Palestinian\n Territories where\n \nwe have \nbeen working since November 2011 \nfunded by \nDFID through a 5\n-\nyear accountable grant, termed the Global Grant, through DFID’\ns Policy Division in London\n. In addition Media Action has, \nsince April 2013\n, been \nan implementing partner \nin a\n \ncontract\n won\n by the British Council under \na \nDFID Framework Tender\n entitled\n \n‘Supporting Stability and Promoting Democracy in the Occupied Territories\n.”\n The central argument of this submission is that media plays a key part in the lives of Palestinians\n and that as a result, \nhigh quality and editorially robust \nprogrammes tha\nt \na\nllow a cross-\nsection of Palestinian society to hold leaders to account\n are central to the OPT’s future democratic development.\n In particular, \no\nnline and social media are powerful \ntools for connecting communities which are divided both geographically and politically (West Bank, the Gaza strip\n, the diaspora\n), \nas well as e\nssential mobili\ns\nation tools for Palestinian youth\n.\n&#xa0;\nBackground&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nBarriers to freedom of expression in the OPT: &#xa0;Media development through debate shows:12. \nBBC Media Action believes that public service\n broadcasting is ultimately about serving the needs of audience\ns\n. \nThrough \na\n \npartnership with Palestine TV\n,\n BBC Media Action \nputs the general public at the heart of its programme-making\n by giving audiences a voice to which they are entitled, by giving them a say in shaping decisions over how their communities are run and by requiring those in power to be accountable to them\n. \nIn turn, by\n \nenabling the \navailability of accessible and relevan\nt information \non \na wide range of issues, \nthe hope is that these programmes help contribute\n to higher levels of \nself- \nefficacy, motivation and participation, \nall \nnecessary drivers of \naccountability.\n13. \nOur f\normative research showed that Palestinians are \ninterested in issues that affect the running of their daily lives, whether\n \nhealth service delivery, employment, emigration or domestic violence. \nThe \nVoices of Palestine\n programme on domestic violence and sexual harassment\n, for example,\n took place at the po\nlice college in Jericho\n. The panel\n included \na\n female police officer responsible for domestic violence &amp; sexual harassment issues, a female criminologist from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and the Head of the Sharia Courts. The audience contained \nboth \nmen and women with a strong representation of police cadets. There wa\ns\n a very lively debate about the appropriateness of women’s \ndress\n;\n with female participants making it clear that sexual harassment was unacceptable \nregardless of clothing choices women ma\ny make\n. \n14. \nThe \nHur El Kalam\n programme on the provision of health services raised a num\nber of issues concerning health care \nrationing\n. There was heated debate over \nwhy some patients \nwere allowed to die from critical illness rather than getting treatment, \nparticularly \nwhen it was clear that \nsome\n hospitals in Israel and Jordan would be willing to carry out the surgery. There was \nalso \na strong discussion on why the PA did not do more to punish people who sold \ncounterfeit\n \nor out-of-\ndate drugs. The most harrowi\nng part of the programme was when a man described losing his wife to medical negligence\n, \nsaying that he felt helpless because there was no mechanism \nto r\nedress he failings he had experienced\n in the health system\n. \nThe Health Minister pledged on the programm\ne to review this gentleman’s case and take action if warranted.\n15.\n \nWe also \nwork closely with our partner stations to build capacity around public service broadcasting values. \nTo make the \nHur El Kalam\n programme on disability, \nfor example, \nB\nBC Media Action \norganized a day-\nlong workshop for the production team with a local disability charity\n. The purpose of the workshop was\n to sensitise \nPTV staff \nto disability issues\n as well as to how disability is portrayed in the media,\n \nsomething the crew\n \nhad not previously\n considered. \nThe programme was extremely powerful\n,\n particularly when it became clear that one of the audience members had not been able to take up a position in the ministry responsible for \ndisability because he himself was wheel\nchair bound and there was n\no disabled access to the ministry buildi\nng!\n16. \nOverall, BBC Media Action\n programming in OPT seeks to secure \n‘more accountable, peaceful and inclusive state and non-state relations in the Palestinian context\n,\n’ characterised by increased \npublic \nengagement i\nn and influence over decision-making and service provision; increased responsiveness of \ngovernment \nauthorities and national service providers to people’s needs, and \nthe evolution of social \nnorms conducive to effective negotiation and debate on governance c\nhallenges\n. \nWe measure impact through \nlevels of informed engagement with gove\nrnance debate and service delivery; youth motivation and engagement in political processes; and local media capacity to support more constructive and objective governance debate \nand engagement\n in OPT\n. \nAfter the first year, our nationally representative data show \nthat both programmes are already achieving many of these targets\n. (86% of those watching believe that the shows are playing a role in holding government to account and 83%\n report improved understanding of governance or conflict-relevant issues as a result of watching the shows)\n. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSocial Media as a tool for engagement&#xa0;\n17. \nBecause of the way the OPT is laid out geographically – spanning two different regions and without free movement between them – it’s not possible to have a fully representative studio audience that cuts across all segments of society. Under such circumstan\nces, social media is a particularly powerful tool for enabling \npeople from different areas to voice their opinions and become part of the process \nof\n holding their leaders to account\n.\n18.  \nPalestinians are \no\nverwhelmingly young\n, \nwith approximately 64% of the\n population under the age of 25 years and  20% of the total population between the ages of 15 -24.\n \nBBC M\nedia \nA\nction\n’s qualitative formative research underline\nd\n the importance of social media for youth (16-25 years) \nas a means both of \nconsuming current aff\nairs and political material\n,\n but also for sharing information and interacting with other actors\n in civil society\n. A poll of 1,200 Palestinian youth in January 2012 found that 32% reported having participated at least once in an internet social group to lob\nby on a public issue\n.\n  \nS\nocial media \nis ubiquitous across all audience segments. \n19. \nA\nlthough \nsocial media is a very popular media tool\n in OPT\n, \nmedia \nprogrammes concentrating on governance had not \npreviously \nused \nsocial media\n \nto connect with audience memb\ners. \nInstead\n, social media networks such as Facebook \nha\nd\n \nlargely been used for individual advocacy efforts.  \n20. In contrast, s\nocial media is a core aspect\n of both BBC Media Action-supported debate programmes\n \nas \nit allows people from different ages (especially youth) \n– and regions, as well as the diaspora - \nto be involved in the \ndiscussion\n \nrather than being limited to the audience present in the studio. \n \nSince starting its official Facebook page\n,\n PBC \nhas increased\n its interaction with the audience five-\nfold.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nConclusions and Recommendations:21. \nThe media is a potentially powerful tool in \nenabling \na peaceful, inclusive, accountable OPT\n, with \nmore than 85% of those watching BBC Media Action-supported debate progra\nmmes believing that the shows are playing a role in holding government to account\n. \n22. \nBBC Media Action’s needs analysis shows that participatory media formats that engage \npeople  \nand politicians alike on issues of everyday service delivery are both \ndemanded – and feasible – in OPT.\n23. \nDue to the particular characteristics of Palestinian demographic, economic and social divisions, as well as the importance of the Palestinian diaspora, the internet provides a unique platform for communication and\n enga\ngement\n. \nSocial media\n helps reduce offline boundaries and offset the lack of mobility in the territories and beyond\n, while also drawing in youth audiences.\n24. \nNearly one third of Palestinian youth surveyed by BBC Media Action reported using social media at\n least once to engage in public affairs. In a \nterritory \nwhere nearly 2/3 of the entire population is under the age of 25, \nschools and universities alike should be encouraged to develop \ncurricula \nthat \nteach \nmedia literac\ny so that students learn to use socia\nl media tools in a responsible manner and in support of a public purpose. \n2\n5\n. \nLocal media might also consider experimenting with n\non\n-\ntraditional forms of media that \ncan stimulate discussion and debate on governance in the OPT. \nProgramming \nfrom elsewhere \nsuggests that drama series, game shows, quizzes and \nsatire\n can also play a role in \nholding\n \nleaders \ngovernment\ns\n \nto account.\n26\n. \nGovernment agencies should be encouraged to\n \nactively encourage and provide opportunities for citizens to express opinions,\n \nask qu\nestions and receive a credible response. \nGovernment departments in the OPT should promote services more effectively, accept public criticism of those services and take part in relevant media programming that enables citizens to express opinions, ask questi\nons and receive a credible response. \n27. \nThe emerging ﬁeld of mGovernance \nelsewhere in the developing world \noffers a particularly compelling example in this regard. On the supply side, mobile phones are being used to provide people with basic information \nabout local and national politics via SMS and voice-based communication software. On the demand side, even quite basic mobile phones are being used for accountability ends as diverse as monitoring elections, improving service delivery and tackling corrupti\non at the local level.\n&#xa0;\n \nThe Global Grant is a Strategic Accountable Grant negotiated between BBC Media Action and DFID which has \nfour output\n areas (Governance, Health, Resilience and Research). The OPT project falls under the Governance output. \nSee \nAccountable\n Grant Arrangement for the Global Grant with the BBC World Service Trust, Component Code 202629-101, Purchase Order 4004952.\n \nhttp://de\nvtracker.dfid.gov.uk/projects/GB-1-202886/\n \nSee DFID Business Case ‘\nSupporting Stability and Promoting Democracy Programme in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (SSPD)\n’.\n \nPresidential \nD\necree \nN\number \n(2)\n \nMarch 201\n0\n Palestinian Centre for Policy and Surve\ny Research (PSR). “Palestinian Public Opinion Poll No (42).” 15-17 December 2011. \nhttp://www.pcpsr.org/survey/polls/2011/p42efull.html#mostvital\n NEC Survey for Fondation Hirondelle (Dec 2010 – April 2011)\n&#xa0;\n Arab World for Research and Development, \nResults of a Specialized Opinion Poll among Palestinian Youth: Activism, Political Efficacy, Palestinian Internal Politics, Elections, Arab Spring and \nNegotiations; 1 February 2012, \nhttp://www.awrad.org/etemplate.php?id=275&amp;x=4\n \nJamal, Amal. “\nThe Palestinian Media: An Obedient Servant or a Vanguard of Democracy?”\nJournal of Palestine Studies\n, Sp\nring 2000. \n \nInterview by BBC Media Action with Salam Fayyad during formative\n r\nesearch\n, March\n, \n2012\n.\n  \n West Bank and Gaza Strip, Population Census of 2007, UNRWA Briefing Paper January 2010 \nhttp://www.unrwa.org/userfiles/2010012035949.pdf\n \n Arab World for Research and Development, \nResults of a Specialized Opinion Poll among Palestinian Youth: Activism, Political Efficacy, Palestinian Internal Politics, Elections, Arab Spring and Negotiati\nons; 1 February 2012, \nhttp://www.awrad.org/etemplate.php?id=275&amp;x=4\n"
