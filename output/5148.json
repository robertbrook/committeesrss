"Written evidence from the Asian Media and Marketing Group [TOB16]\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1. Asian Trader repr\nesents a readership of over 200,\n000 and we regularly\n \nspeak out on behalf of our \nreaders to voice their concerns,\n not just\n \nthrough Asian Trader but also\n,\n on their behalf to Members of Parliament.\n \nT\nhis readership includes over 47,\n000 convenience stores and newsagents\n nationwide,\n which make a huge\n contribution to the UK economy,\n and\n \nnot just financially - they are often the heartbeat of\n \ntheir community.\n2. The Asian community owns over 75% of all convenience\n \nstores/newsagents nationwide. As such convenience retailing\n,\n and the\n \nstruggles independent store owners face\n,\n is a key concern of ours and\none we regularly write about. Only to frequently do we cover the impact\n \nof the illicit tobacco trade on our honest retailers and their local\n \ncommunities.\n3. In our experience,\n counterfeiting and smuggling is already having a\n \ndevastating effect on small retailers. In addition to the illicit trade costing\n \nthe taxpayer almost £2bn according to the recent National Audit Office\n \nreport - and this is conservative as these are HMRC figures based on\n \n2011 data - the average convenien\nce retailer loses more than £40,\n000\n \nevery year through illegal tobacco sales. Illicit traders - often part of\n \ncriminal gangs - continue to lurk in street corners across the UK with no\nregard to who buy their products.\n4. The inability of HMRC to control the illicit trade in tobacco products gives\n \nsmugglers and counterfeiters a platform to expand their illegal activities.\n \nIt is clear from the recent National Audit Office report that not enough is\n \nbeing done by HMRC and Government to tackle the illegal trade in Roll\n \nYour Own (RYO) and cigarette smu\nggling. According to the report,\n non\n-\nduty\n \npaid product for RYO and cigarettes represent 38% and 9% of UK\n \nsales - our readers have told us this is more like 49% and 14%\n \nrespectively.\n5. Furthermore the majority of stores are run by families where ladies are\n \nat the till and are being exposed to threats and violence by criminal\n \ngangs.\n6. The Police are unable to respond in time and often will not attend unless\n \nblood has been spilled.\n7. These stores are at the heart of their local community and play an\n \nintegral part on the High Street.\n8. Whilst many areas of this inquiry our out of scope for our comment, on\n \nbehalf of our readers we wanted to thank the Home Affairs Select\n \nCommittee for launching this inquiry. The Government needs to\n \ncrackdown on the illicit trade, and introduce more severe penalties for\n \ncriminals who knowingly sell illegal product to smokers.\n9. As an organisation we are happy to play our part in assisting with this\n \nwhere we can; and we will continue to work with Asian Trader retailers\n \nto encourage them to report any illegal activity in their area to the\n \nrelevant authorities in order to protect their livelihoods. In our\n \nexperience, retailers are often best placed to do so, however they suffer\n \nfrom the lack of joined up working between local police and Trading\n \nStandards services.\n10. I felt it may be useful to include some of the recent cuttings from Asian\n \nTrader on this topic which highlight just some of the concerns of our\n \nretailers - you can find these attached.\n11. In the interests of transparency, Asian Media and Marketing Group\n \nregularly receives funding from tobacco companies both for marketing\n \nand campaigning purposes. However, the views expressed represent the\n \nlegitimate concerns of our contributing retailers and readership. We\n \nstand as guarantors of this.\n12. If I can be of any further assistance please don't hesitate to let me know\n&#xa0;\n29 August 2013\n"
