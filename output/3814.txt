[[[&#xa0;]]]a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; the money is insufficient  to achieve the desired improvement for disadvantaged pupils (Sibieta, 2009);b)&#xa0;&#xa0; the money is insufficient to incentivise the best schools to take additional FSM pupils, given the high-stakes nature of league tables and other performance indicators. c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Quality of activities undertaken by schools &#xa0;All of these can be improved to some extent, though this may be circumscribed by a) amount available to spend, and b) the counter-incentives of performance indicators (the Government’s new performance indicators may help, to some extent). But fundamentally, the scale of challenge is also enormous: the level of financial and social capital inequality between families cannot simply be compensated for by schools alone. We need to address wealth inequality, and to empower and engage working class parents. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; End the practice of VA, foundation and academy schools being their own admissions authority, and convening their own appeals panels. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Direct schools to publish the data on who applied to their school, and who was granted admission, in relation to socio-economic background – and the Office of the Schools Adjudicator to scrutinise this data.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Empower and resource the Office of the Schools Adjudicator to carry out random checks and enforcement of schools’ admissions procedures. &#xa0;

(2011) Review of Vocational Education – The Wolf Report.  DfE, London.&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0; See e.g. Dunne et al. 2007. Disadvantaged pupils are likely to be placed in low sets and streams because they arrive with lower achievement. However, research has shown that teacher perception may play a part in such allocation, and also that low sets tend to suffer from poor quality teaching (Ireson &amp; Hallam, 2001). OECD (2010), a point regularly observed by Michael Gove (e.g. Gove 2011). Wherein social segregation is shown to be especially strong. See also Moss’ work on boys and literacy. As the UK has traditionally maintained a strong, hierarchised distinction between vocational and academic routes.  The Pupil Premium is set to increase to 2.5bn in 2014-15, but even so the sums involved are smaller than originally recommended by the Sutton Trust (2010a) and Liberal Democrat manifesto, and in comparison with similar international initiatives such as the Harlem Children’s Zone project. Sibieta (2009) estimated that the cost for getting the attainment of poor children up to the national average would require the pupil premium to be set at over £25,000 per pupil. In the US, charter agreements are between 3-5 years duration. This and the above three recommendations were all made by the Academies Commission (2013). This recommendation has been made by West et al (2009), the Academies Commission (2013), and Francis (for ASCL, 2013).
