[[[ (FSS028)]]]1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We are not aware of any cohesive central government strategy for the development of the UK forensic market. The combination of austerity reductions prompting police forces to be far more selective on what evidence and case types they submit to FSPs alongside police plans to increase the amount of forensic work insourced is dramatically reducing the market size for outsourced forensic services provided by the private sector. We estimate the market available to private providers has reduced from circa £180m of a few years ago to circa £80m today, with further downward pressure as forensic budgets are cut further.1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Despite the proven value of using forensic services in the detection of crime and the inherent cost efficiencies of using forensic analysis vs alternative policing measures, police and other law enforcement agencies continue to apply their own budget reductions to out-sourced services, including forensic services. Private forensic suppliers will have their ability to conduct R&amp;D severely curtailed as a direct result of reduced profitability and also a reduced opportunity to recover initial R&amp;D investment in a rapidly shrinking market, removing incentive to make initial R&amp;D investment. 1.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Many sources of government funding to support R&amp;D have been terminated, leaving no or very little grant aid for the support of R&amp;D, especially in the forensics sector due to its rapidly shrinking size.1.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As a consequence of the rapidly falling market size FSP services are increasingly price sensitive, building pressure for further price reductions. The combined impact of falling market volumes and falling prices will inevitably have an adverse impact on resource available for on-going R&amp;D or other improvements to services developed by the private FSPs, whereas very little or no R&amp;D or similar improvements have been developed by police in-house activity so far.1.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As a consequence of the points raised above it is our conclusion that there is no national strategy for forensic science and, therefore, it cannot possibly be sufficient to support either forensic science R&amp;D or the criminal justice system.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The implementation of the contracts to award previous FSS casework to KFS ran smoothly from our perspective. We have no knowledge of the budget to close the FSS and so have no opinion on this aspect.2.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is our opinion, however, that whatever the costs of closing the FSS these will be recouped many times over by the more cost efficient delivery of the same services from private FSPs who are providing the same high quality service at considerably lower prices than the FSS were using.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1               The vast majority of outsourced police forensic services are procured via the Next Generation Forensic Framework Agreement. For private FSPs to secure approval to supply services via this procurement vehicle they must have secured the necessary accreditations for each forensic discipline they wish to provide. The accreditations are awarded and subsequently monitored by an independent accreditation service, UKAS, the same service that awarded and maintained similar accreditations to the FSS. Therefore, the private FSPs provide services to the same or higher standards as previously provided by the FSS, which are constantly reviewed and enhanced by UKAS, The Forensic Science Regulator and other stakeholders such as the National DNA Database Delivery Unit and NDNAD Strategy Board. 3.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The same is not true of some small FSPs, individual forensic experts who continue to operate outside of ISO 17025 and some in-house police forensic services, where individual police forces are able to provide their own forensic services without accreditation, or at best with nominal accreditation but without the breadth of accreditation required for each forensic discipline, which is a mandatory requirement for private FSPs before they are eligible to tender for police forensic contracts. 3.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To comply with accreditation requirements all operational staff must be thoroughly trained and assessed as competent in each aspect of their area of expertise. This is a requirement of the Forensic Science Regulator Codes of Practice and Conduct a cornerstone to achieving ISO 17025 accreditation.3.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; KFS did not use the FSS for any of its training requirements. As a consequence, it is KFS’ opinion that none of its own staff have suffered any detriment to their own training needs.3.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; KFS offers training courses across the breadth of forensic disciplines to police and other interested parties, on a similar basis to that previously provided by the FSS. It is thus KFS’s opinion that the CJS has not materially suffered from any loss of training service offered by the FSS, as the same service is available from KFS and we welcome the additional source of income any such service would generate.&#xa0;4.1                             The Forensic Science Regulator should set the standard for any particular service and then promulgate the minimum standard service providers must achieve prior to providing services. The Regulator should thus promote forensic best practise and effectively set the standard for minimum service levels in the UK, thereby promoting the excellence of UK based forensic services to the world.4.2               Having established best practise the Regulator should monitor and ensure that the appropriate minimum standard for the provision of any forensic service is maintained. This requirement should be universally applied to all providers of forensic services.4.3              The Forensic Regulator should act as the ultimate arbiter of disputes arising between FSPs and other CJS partners.4.4              The Regulator should promote the UK FSPs to international criminal investigation services and their CJS.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;5.1               During the last few years austerity measures have generated pressure on police budgets causing forces to be more selective on what they will submit for forensic analysis. Police forces have also increased pre-submission screening of evidence prior to submission for forensic analysis. Macro economic factors have thus had a substantial impact on market volumes. Over the same period pricing has become increasingly competitive as suppliers seek to grow or maintain their total sales income against the backdrop of a very rapidly declining market. The total market has thus reduced due to an overall reduction in volumes and also because of price reductions.5.2               As part of the FSS closure a significant proportion of police forensic activity previously outsourced was instead brought in-house, further substantially reducing the market size available to FSPs. The in-sourcing of previously outsourced service is the most destabilising factor for private FSPs, as the gradual decline in revenue from reducing volumes or falling prices is more manageable over time, whereas in-sourcing represents an immediate market reduction from which there is no recovery. Continued police in-sourcing activity also undermines investor interest in the sector, increasing the perceived “risk” that the market will reduce further or disappear in-house entirely. At the very least, police in-sourcing increases price competition to the point that margins are potentially squeezed beyond an FSPs ability to generate sufficiently attractive investor returns.5.3               KFS estimates the current police outsourced forensic market at circa £80m and very likely to fall further as a result of additional budget reductions for police, being disproportionately focused on forensic expenditure.5.4               The market cannot be considered stable until the persistent reductions in police forensic spend and in-sourced activity have stabilised.&#xa0;

[[[How are forensic science services procured by police forces and could procurement processes be improved?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]6.1               The vast majority of forensic services for the police are procured using the Next Generation Forensic Framework Agreement. The national procurement process is managed by the Forensic Marketplace Management Team attached to the Home Office (formally Police Science and Forensics Unit, NPIA). The FMM Team assist regional police forces in the implementation of their own tenders under the umbrella framework agreement.&#xa0;6.2               The closure of the FSS delayed the previous schedule for regional mini tenders using the framework agreement, resulting in the current round of tenders being truncated to ensure that they are all renewed within legal time frames. It would be better for future tenders to be phased so that there was a reasonable period for scaling up and/or scaling down during implementation of contract awards.&#xa0;6.3              Some police tenders remain outside the framework and are either made using a purchase order for low value purchases or a separate stand alone procurement process. We could not suggest how this process may be improved.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]7.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; On leaving the FSS undoubtedly some of its scientists left the forensic science profession, by either retiring, taking up alternative careers or even leaving the country.7.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; However, the market for outsourced forensics has more than halved since the decision to close the FSS was made. In such circumstances there would have inevitably been a loss of intellectual wealth even if the FSS had remained open. Many of the scientists previously working at the FSS have since taken up roles within the private FSPs or police forensic facilities. There remains in the remaining FSPs and police forensic laboratories sufficient intellectual property to ensure the efficient and effective delivery of forensic science, especially as the volume of activity has halved since the FSS’s closure.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[8. Are current arrangements for the FSS’s archives satisfactory? How could arrangements for the retention of case files and forensic materials in the UK be improved?]]]&#xa0;8.1 We are not privy to the detail of how the FSS’s archives are arranged. We are not best placed to suggest how such arrangements might be improved.&#xa0;&#xa0;
