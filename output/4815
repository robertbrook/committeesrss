defaultTo continue to promulgate the message that litter associated with plastic grocery carrier bags is a significant issue when in fact it only makes up less than 1% of all litter by weight it is only found in 3.5% of all sites surveyed by KBT is a lowly 23 out of 26 items surveyed and finally is the only product  that has recorded a significant reduction in litter during the time of KBT surveys whereas other far more significant items that contribute to litter continue to grow.

defaultTo close on a more sombre and immediate note immediately after the EAC enquiry the direct result of the ministers assertion that he proposes to continue pursuing the biodegradable option is that the biggest film producer and recycler of film in the UK has notified me and WRAP that it plans to suspend trials to use post-consumer recycled film in building membranes due to the risks associated and the membrane failing which would result in damp penetration. This will result in a loss of a potential to recycle tens of thousands of tonnes of post-consumer film which will make plastic recycling targets in the

default even more difficult to achieve, if not impossible, yet another unintended consequence of an ill thought out policy.
