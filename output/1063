default&#xa0;
defaultWhat are the historical and philosophical justifications for denying prisoners the right to vote?
default&#xa0;
defaultA) Historical Justifications
default&#xa0;
default[1]
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe historical justification
defaults
default for 
defaultthe current restrictions on
default prisoner 
defaultvoting
default 
defaultare
default questionable. In the law of England and Wales, and in Northern Ireland, prisoners have not been regarded as subject to 
default“civic death”
default for the duration of their incarceration since the passing of the Forfeiture Act 1870 ended the practice of 
defaultattainder, by which a convicted felon’
defaults property became forfeit to the Crown.
default 
default&#xa0;
default[2]
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSince the
defaultse reforms
default, imprisonment has 
defaultcome to be regarded as 
defaultprimarily 
defaultinvolving
default a deprivation of 
defaultthe prisoner’
defaults 
defaultliberty
default, and the 
defaultcourts have recognised that ‘
defaulta convicted prisoner, in spite of his imprisonment, retains all civil rights which are not taken away expressly or by necessary implication
default’
default.
default One of the rights currently expressly removed is the right of prisoners 
default(other than those imprisoned for contempt, default or on remand) 
defaultto vote.
default But, as the Government has acknowledged in the notes accompanying 
defaultthe Voting Eligibility (Prisoners) Draft Bill, 
defaultthere has 
defaultnot 
defaultbeen constancy in the UK's approach to prisoner disenfranchisement since 1870. The most that can be said is that '
default[t]
defaulthere has been 
defaultsome form
default of bar on prisoners voting in UK legislation for 
defaultmost
default of the past 140 years'.
default&#xa0;
default[3]
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUnder the Forfeiture Act prisoners convicted of a felony (a class of serious crime used in the criminal law of England and Wales until 1967) and sentenced to imprisonment for more than one year were subject to statutory disenfr
defaulta
defaultnchisement.
default Other prisoners were subject to what might be described as 
default“
defaultadministrative disenfranchisement
default”
default, in that they could not register 
defaulta prison as their residence for the purpose of voting
default and could not leave prison to vote 
defaultin their home constituency 
defaultwithout the
default Home Secretary’
defaults permission.
default&#xa0;
default[4]
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe administrative bars to prisoners voting were removed in the aftermath of the Second World War.
default Under the Representation of the People Act 1948 postal ballots were for the first time made available to individuals ‘no longer resident at their qualifying address’.
default 
defaultPrisoners not covered by the statutory restriction under the Forfeiture Act could use postal ballots to vote at their home address
default. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, this meant that all prisoners not convicted of a felony with a prison sentence of more than one year could vote. In Scotland, with the abolition of outlawry in 1949, all prisoners (regardless of the seriousness of their offence) could vote.
default&#xa0;
default[5]
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOn the recommendation of a Law Reform Commission Report (which explicitly recognised the consequences 
defaultfor
default prisoner enfranchisement
default), Parliament ended the classification of offences as felonies and misdemeanours in 1967.
default Between January 1968 and April 1969 no restrictions existed 
defaulton the voting rights of UK prisoners provided that they followed the rules applicable to postal ballots. There is no empirical data available as to the number of prisoners who exercised the right to vote between 1949 and 1969, but questions in Parliament during the era confirm that prisoner voting by postal ballot did occur.
default 
default&#xa0;
default[6]
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThat this liberalisation of the restrictions on prisoner voting took 
defaultplace with little debate, 
defaulton the recommendation of expert bodies
default such as the Law Reform Commission, is entirely in keeping with other largely de-politicised reforms of the criminal justice system in this era.
default Likewise, when the Home Secretary James Callaghan introduced the current ban on prisoners voting in 1969,
default that move marked the start of an era in 
defaultwhich criminal justice poli
defaultcy became an intensely politicised
default 
defaultmatter
default. Today’s 
defaultrestrictions on prisoners’ right to vote are 
defaulttherefore 
defaultnot 
defaulta
default long-established, 
defaultnear “
defaultimmutable
default”
default feature of the UK’s 
defaultelectoral arrangements
default. They are a product of modern concerns over criminal justice and, as with other aspects of the UK’s criminal justice policy, should conform to the UK’s human rights commitments.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultB) Philosophical Justifications
default&#xa0;
default[7]
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs Laws LJ has recognised in one of the leading judgments on prisoner voting in the domestic courts, ‘there are deep philosophical differences of view between reasonable people upon the question of prisoners’ suffrage’.
default 
defaultThe UK Government, in opposing the 
defaultHirst
default 
defaultclaim
default before the European Court of Human Rights, 
defaultjustified the restrictions on 
defaultgrounds
default of
default 
default‘enhancing civic responsibility and respect for the rule of law by depriving those who had breached the basic rules of society of the right to have a say in the way such rules were made for the duration of their sentence’.
default&#xa0;
default[8]
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe European Court of Human Rights did not dismiss the importance of these concerns in its 
defaultHirst
default judgment, asserting that there is ‘no reason in the circumstances of this application to exclude these aims as untenable or 
defaultper se 
defaultincompatible with the right’.
default In its recent 
defaultScoppola
default decision, the Court’s Grand Chamber reaffirmed that these constituted ‘legitimate aims’.
default The touchstone of the UK’s breach of human rights in denying prisoners the vote therefore lies not in the underlying reasoning behind disenfranchisement, but 
defaultin the fact 
defaultthat this rationale was not subject to debate in light of human rights standards in the course of the legislative process
default and that the present restrictions are disproportionate to the aim.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhy is the right to vote considered to be a 
defaulthuman
default right?
default&#xa0;
default[9]
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe right to vote is enshrined 
defaultas one of
default the UK’s international human rights commitments. Under Article 3 of Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights, 
defaultthe UK accepted the responsibility to ‘ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature’. Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides a right for individuals to take part in public affairs in their country of citizenship. Furthermore, under Article 40 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, ‘every citizen of the
default&#xa0;
defaultUnion has the right to vote and to stand as a candidate at municipal elections in the Member
default&#xa0;
defaultState in which he or she resides under the same conditions as nationals of that State’.
default&#xa0;
default[10]
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIf the UK repudiated its international commitments, however, this would 
defaultnot of itself 
defaultdispel
default the 
defaultstatus
default of 
defaultthe 
defaultvot
defaulte
default as a right under the UK constitution. 
defaultI
defaultn domestic law
default, into the early-twentieth century
default,
default the ability to vote was hedged by property- and gender-
defaultbased restrictions.
default 
defaultAdditional votes for business owners and university graduates were 
defaultonly 
defaultremoved for general elections in 194
default8
default (but remained a factor in Northern Ireland 
defaultParliament 
defaultelections 
defaultuntil
default 19
default68
default).
default 
defaultThrough this 
defaultprocess of 
defaultlegislative reform the UK 
defaultcame 
defaultto embrace Jeremy Bentham’s principle of one
default 
defaultperson, one vote, of equal worth.
default 
default&#xa0;
default[11]
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSenior judges now recognise democracy in the UK ‘is founded on the principle that each individual has equal value’.
default 
defaultMoreover, whilst the UK constitution operates on a basis that Parliament is sovereign, and can therefore legislate in a way which fundamentally alters personal interests, 
defaultthis authority today rests on the basis
default 
defaultof 
defaultParliament’s
default democratic legitimacy. As Keith Ewing has recognised, parliamentary sovereignty may be ‘a constitutional principle acquired before the advent of democracy, but it remains one which might be said to be the most democratic of all constitutional principles’.
default 
defaultFor Parliament to regard the vote as a privilege, to be withdrawn without justification, would be to undermine the legitimacy of its own constitutional powers
default,
default and may even justify judicial intervention
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultIs disqualifying prisoners from voting a suitable part of their punishment?
default&#xa0;
default[12]
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAdvocates of an absolute prohibition on convicted prisoners voting maintain that any 
defaultperson
default convicted of an offence warranting imprisonment has 
defaultdisregarded
default 
defaulthis
default civic responsibility
default and thereby forfeited his vote. Advocates of the enfranchisement of all prisoners, by contrast, maintain that the right to vote is foundational to the UK’s democracy and should not be withdrawn under any circumstances. The former position 
defaultdisregards
default the 
defaultcurrent 
defaultrequirements of the right to vote
default under the ECHR
default, whilst the later po
defaultsition risks overstating them.
default 
default&#xa0;
default[13]
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEven though the right to vote is a human right, it does not follow that it is an 
defaultabsolute
default right. Foreign nationals, for example, can legitimately be denied the vote without violating the UK’s ECHR commitments. The issue for the European Court is one of proportionality. In the context of prisoners, it is willing to concede that restrictions on the ability of some prisoners to 
defaultvote are justifiable
default 
default(provided that the rationale underpinning such legislative restrictions is considered by Parliament). But to restrict almost all prisoners from voting fails to give adequate regard to the 
defaultfundamental 
defaultimportance of the vote in a democracy. 
default&#xa0;
default[14]
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default 
defaultIn other words, the importance of the vote is such that it cannot simply be removed as an adjunct to the deprivation of a prisoner’s liberty. For example, one problem with conceiving of the loss of the right to vote as a punishment that runs in parallel with the loss of an individual prisoner’s liberty, is that some prisoners continue to be deprived of their liberty not as a punishment, but in the interests of public safety.
default Moreover, criminals sentenced to very short periods of imprisonment may lose their right to vote if 
defaultthat imprisonment happens to coincide with an election, 
defaultintroducing an element of arbitrariness into the punishment.
default 
default&#xa0;
default[15]
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Court requires that a specific rationale must be identified for imposing voting restrictions upon particular prisoners
default, as opposed to an ‘automatic and indiscriminate’ rule with a general effect on a large body of prisoners
default.
default The Court
default does not, therefore, reject the idea that removal of the vote 
defaultcan
default, in some cases, constitute an appropriate additional penalty to removal of an individual’s liberty.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat are the financial implications of maintaining the current ban in terms of claims by prisoners for compensation?
default&#xa0;
default[16]
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis issue 
defaultof legal implications for continued UK non-compliance 
defaultwill be addressed in paragraph 20 below, but the committee should note that the European Court has been slow to award compensation 
defaultto prisoners who have been denied the vote in cases heard to date, in spite of the delays in reforming the law. It explicitly refused to award monetary compensation (beyond costs) to the claimants in 
defaultHirst
default and (over five years later) in 
defaultGreens &amp; MT
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultIs sentence length a legally robust basis on which to retain an entitlement to vote?
default&#xa0;
default[17]
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultI
defaultn various decisions relating 
defaultto prisoner voting 
defaultthe European Court 
defaulthas 
defaultmention
defaulted giving the power of judges on sentencing to remove the vote,
default or removing the vote for particular crimes in which the nexus of criminality serves to undermine the democratic process (for example, offences related to electoral fraud
default, abuse of office by elected representatives
default or political violence),
default as being justifiable approaches to withdrawing the franchise from particular prisoners. 
default&#xa0;
default[18]
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNeither 
defaultapproach
default is without its short comings. 
defaultUpon conviction for a criminal offence, a sentencing decision personal to an individual
default (following a fair trial before an independent tribunal) 
defaultis
default necessary to legitimately remove 
defaulther 
defaultlibert
defaulty,
default but a separate judicial direction as to the length of deprivation of the vote might prove difficult for prisons to administer. It might even, in line with 
defaultScoppola
default, permit the state to deprive someone of their right to vote even after their liberty has been restored
default (
defaultnot an approach I would advocate following
default)
default.
default Removal of the right to vote for particular classes of offences (broadly, offences striking at the operation of democracy), regardless of the seriousness of the criminality at issue, smacks of the adoption of individuated
default reciprocal penalties within the legal system
default (
defaultor, put bluntly, an 
default“
defaulteye for 
defaulteye, tooth for tooth”
default conception of justice
default). 
defaultThese remain mere
default suggestions by the court on how to proceed, and are not approaches that the UK must necessarily adopt in order to comply with its ECHR obligations.
default&#xa0;
default[19]
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSentence length stands as an indicator of 
defaultthe seriousness of a criminal wrong committed by an individual. The rationale of a sentence for a criminal conviction in the domestic legal system
defaults
default is ordinarily to remove an individual’s liberty in proportion to the seriousness of the criminal offence he has committed
default (for Hegel, ‘the concept and measure of [a criminal’s] punishment are derived from his act’
default)
default.
default 
defaultSentence length
default therefore potentially serves as a measure by which to divide criminality so serious that it warrants removal of the vote from lesser criminality. The difficulty lies in drawing the line where a prisoner has so damaged social norms as to warrant this additional punishment.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat would be the likely legal consequences, both domestically and internationally of: a) keeping the law as it is? b) passing legislation giving some prisoners the right to vote, but in a way that maintains a form of blanket restriction?
default 
defaultc) seeking to comply by enfranchising the minimum number of prisoners possible consistent with our international legal obligations?
default&#xa0;
defaultA) Maintaining the Existing Law
default&#xa0;
default[20]
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMaintaining the law would likely do lasting damage to the UK’s reputation as a rights-respecting country, 
defaultas doing so would undoubtedly constitute a violation of its commitment to abide by the decisions of the European Court
default.
default Moreover, as the UK’s rationale for retaining restrictions upon 
defaultprisoner voting rests upon maintaining respect for the rule of law, flouting a judgment in this way would undermine the UK’s claim to moral authority.
default&#xa0;
defaultB) Maintaining some form of automatic restriction
default&#xa0;
default[21]
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs noted in paragraph 19 above, removal of the right to vote on the basis of sentence length will potentially be regarded by the European Court as a proportionate restriction upon the qualified right to vote, especially in light of the 
defaultScoppola
default decision’s acceptance of the Italian disqualification from voting of prisoners serving sentences of more than three years.
default Much depends on the point selected by Parliament at which such 
defaulta 
defaultdisqualification would apply. 
defaultI would consider that option 1 under the Draft Bill (removal of the vote from prisoners serving four years or more) would be justifiable in light of the level of criminality (and thereby societal harm) displayed by individuals
default subject to such sentences
default. The removal of the vote could be justified as a proportionate punishment in such cases and would provide a long
default-
defaultterm legislative solution to this issue.
default&#xa0;
defaultC) Minimum Compliance
default&#xa0;
default[22]
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMinimum compliance with international obligations is, by definition, compliance. In light of the protracted nature of the prisoner voting saga, I would believe that the European Court would accept legislation under option 2 (removal of the vote from prisoners serving six months or more) as a good-faith effort 
defaultby the UK Parliament 
defaultto 
defaultrespond to 
defaultthe
default repeated judgments against the UK. It must be emphasised, however, that this legislative response does not carry with it the virtue of longevity
default (especially in light of paragraph 15 above
default)
default. The ECHR is a 
default‘
defaultliving instrument
default’
default,
default and what is accepted by the Court as minimal compliance today would not neces
defaultsarily remain so in the medium term as a European consensus develops on the voting rights of prisoners. In particular, it is worth noting (in light of paragraph 4 above) that this solution would see a narrower section of prisoners able to vote than under the Representation of the People Act 1948.
default&#xa0;
defaultWould giving prisoners the right to vote have any significant administrative impact on either the prison system or the Electoral Commission?
default&#xa0;
default[23]
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMuch would depend on the 
defaultmode by which prisoners would be given the vote. The Draft Bill proposes 
defaultthat 
defaultprisoners 
defaultwould 
defaultexercis
defaulte
default the vote by post or by proxy,
default which in light of the number of individuals who stand to be enfranchised (relative to the size of the electorate), even under option 1, would impose no special burdens. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIs there any evidence to suggest that allowing prisoners to vote would have a significant impact on particular constituencies?
default&#xa0;
default[24]
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAgain, much would depend on the constituency in which prisoners would be given the vote. The Draft Bill proposes prisoners exercising the vote in the constituency in which they were last resident.
default  This would impose no special burdens on constituencies which contain prisons.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat lessons can be drawn from the experience of other countries regarding prisoner voting? 
default&#xa0;
default[25]
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIreland and Canada, both comparable common
default-
defaultlaw countries, have in the last decade enfranchised their entire prison populations without manifest administrative difficulty.
default Ireland legislated in reaction to the 
defaultHirst
default decision, whereas Canada legislated in response to a ruling by its own Supreme Court. The rationale behind that ruling should provide pause for thought for legislators tempted to dismiss outright the right of prisoners to vote. As the majority ruled, 
default‘the wholesale disenfranchisement of all penitentiary inmates, even with a two-year minimum sentence requirement, is not demonstrably justified in our free and democratic society’.
default No one suggests that the UK is a less confident or less mature democracy than Canada, or Ireland, and it is difficult therefore to claim that social norms 
defaultor the democratic process 
defaultwill be threatened by allowing a measure of prisoner enfranchisement.
