defaultQ159 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default We are
default under a little bit of time pressure this afternoon, so we will go straight into it, if we may, but first 
defaultI 
defaultmake you 
defaultwelcome
default. I quite often ask people to introduce themselves. I am not certain that is necessary in this case. You 
defaultare
default familiar faces to us. 
defaultI would like to go straight in, if I may, to the core question that we are seeking to address in this inquiry, which is, looking backwards
default—
defaultthis is the less important part of the question, in a sense
default—
defaultwhere has the health service got to in response to the Nicholson challenge as we get into the second half of 20
default13
default&#x2011;
default14?  H
defaultow much real sustainable change do you think has taken place? That is the first question. 
defaultThe second question
default is
default, more importantly, looking forward, either to the end of 2015 or, indeed, to the second half of the decade as well, what evidence do you think there is that necessary change is either being planned for or, better still, executed within the service? Who would like to go first?
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultThank you for inviting the King
default’
defaults Fund and me to give evidence. On the so
default&#x2011;
defaultcalled £20 billion challenge
default,
default we have to rely on NHS England in terms of evidence for that. The other evidence I could quote is a survey we do of finance directors in foundation 
defaulttrusts and CCGs. It is not a statistically valid sample but it gives us some indication about things like this. You heard the evidence from 
defaultSir 
defaultDavid Nicholson himself that, looking back, it looks
default as if
default, at a big aggregate level, the NHS has been making its £4 billion to £4.5 billion savings each year
default,
default and 
defaultit looks as if
default it is on track
default this year.
default I would supplement that with the evidence we get 
defaultfrom
default talking to finance directors
default, and t
defaulthey would confirm that, I th
defaultink. 
defaultI 
defaultwould 
defaultpoint out that there is an issue around hospitals and what we are talking about here. If you talk to a trust and ask them about their productivity gains, they will not use those words
default: t
defaulthey will use 
default“
defaultcost improvement programmes
default”. 
defaultEssentially, they will look at what their projected income is and what their costs are
default,
default and whatever the gap is becomes their cost improvement programme. That is the way, down on the ground, they look at this challenge.
defaultHow do you fill that gap? You may make s
defaultome cost savings and 
defaultyou may try and get some more income. One of the issues, it seems to me, with the whole QIPP Nicholson challenge is, 
default“
defaultWhat is just extra income for people? What can roll forward and, in a sense, be counted not just as a one
default&#x2011;
defaultoff saving?
default”
default That
default,
default I think
default,
default we are a bit less clear about.
defaultAnita defaultCharlesworthdefault: 
defaultIt is important to emphasise how significant the pay policy has been in enabling the NHS to fill the gap and also there have been big reductions in administrative costs over the last two years, but administrative costs are 
defaultnow 
defaultexpected to start rising a bit again. In terms of the sustainability, they have done well over the last two years in aggregate, although there are over 40 hospital NHS trusts
default, mainly acute,
default that either were or would have been in deficit if t
defaulthey had not had central support. T
defaulthat is heading for a third of acute trusts
default, which
default are already struggling despite the help of a pay freeze and reductions in central management costs. 
defaultThe pay freeze cannot go on 
defaultfor ever
default. The management costs are a one
default&#x2011;
defaultoff. Although 
defaultit now looks like 
defaultthe NHS over the last 15 years
default 
defaultdid increase productivity, this requires a massive
default step increase in productivity. 
defaultI think NHS England said it was about 12% of the gains so far 
defaultthat 
defaultcame from labour productivity and a quarter from the pay. So the sustainability looks really challenging as you start to get pay pressures emerging. But also the system at the moment, both this year and next, has almost nothing in it in terms of hospitals
default—
defaultthe tariff
default—
defaultfor service improvements
default. Y
defaultet
default,
default if you look at Monitor
default’
defaults analysis of 2013
default&#x2011;
default14 plans
default,
default they are 
defaultstating
default that trusts are saying that to address Keogh, the Francis r
defaulteview and the A and E pressures,
default they need significantly 
defaultto 
defaultincrease their clinical staffing. 
defaultI
defaultt does feel 
defaultas if
default we are hitting an imbalance. 
defaultPeople have made t
defaulthe easy savings and 
defaultthey 
defaultare running out. By NHS England
default’
defaults admission, we are not seeing very much progress with transformative s
defaultavings,
default and quality pressures are really starting to bite
default.
defaultQ160 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default 
defaultBefore we get into that in detail
default,
default can I ask a reasonably limited question around instances that you have seen
default? T
defaulthe question is how prevalent are instances of, say
default, 
defaultthings 
defaultthat are plainly one
default&#x2011;
defaultoff—
defaultand the 
defaultmost obvious one is a land sale—so 
defaultmaking the books balance by something that produces cash in year but does not change anything for future years?
defaultAnita defaultCharlesworthdefault: 
defaultThe central
default evidence is that these sort of—
defaultin the jargon
default— 
defaultnon
default&#x2011;
defaultrecurrent
default 
defaultsavings look to be growing as a proportion of people
default’
defaults savings. The big one that people seem to use is holdin
defaultg vacancies for a longer period, b
defaultut
default while
default you are increasingly concern
defaulted about your clinical staffing
default that becomes a very difficult thing to do and is certainly not a sustainable productivity gain.
defaultQ161 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultIs it something that is clearly visible in the NHS England numbers or any numbers that either you or the King
default’
defaults Fund 
defaultgenerate
default?
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultI am not sure they are clear in the overall numbers
default,
default and
default the reporting of these savings
default is an issue. There was a huge spreadsheet that NHS England us
defaulted to compile from PCTs on this and i
defaultt was almost totally impenetrable. I am used to looking at spreadsheets virtually every day and I 
defaultjust 
defaultgot completely lost in that. 
defaultT
defaulthere is a significant issue about 
defaultthe reporting of these numbers—what lies behind the numbers, as you are pointing out.
default Is it recurrent? Is it non
default&#x2011;
defaultrecurrent
default? How sustainable are these things?
default Clearly, 
defaultthere have b
defaulteen big cuts in central budgets, b
defaultut you can only do that once. Whether you count that then as a saving for ever is almost philosophical. 
defaultQ162 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultIt does not 
defaultsound
default like a saving for ever if Anita 
defaultCharlesworth
default is saying that the cuts in admin costs are about to reverse.
defaultAnita defaultCharlesworthdefault: 
defaultNot fully. They were just over £5 billion in 2010
default&#x2011;
default11
default,
default down to £3
default.5 billion, I think, last year and 
defaultgoing back up to about £4.2 billion. 
defaultW
defaulte will end this spending review spending less on admin than when we started, but it is clear that we cannot go on making those savings. Even if you eliminated admin costs completely, you would not deal with it all and 
defaultyou 
defaultwould still have a problem.
defaultJohn Applebydefault: T
defaulto 
defaultadd 
defaultquickly to that, the real is
defaultsue is not about saving money—t
defaulthat is the 
default“
defaulthalf
default&#x2011;
defaultway
default there,
default” as it were—but 
defaultwhat you spend that money on. Presumably
default,
default we are saving admin costs not because we like to save admin costs but because we face the need to provide more hips and do more. 
defaultI
defaultt is about spending that money on something else. 
defaultMy point about the reporting, 
defaultin a sense, 
defaultis that 
defaultwe do not quite know where the money has gone.
defaultQ163 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultI will ask a further question and then pass it over
default. T
defaulto look at it from
default the other end of the telescope, i
defaultf you look at the way services are currently delivered within the health and care system, where 
defaultdo you think the commissioners and 
defaultthe managers
default—
defaultthe management teams
default—
defaultshould be looking for opportunities to use resources more efficiently?
defaultAnita defaultCharlesworthdefault: 
defaultThere are two pieces of work that shine a light on this. One is 
defaultthat 
defaultMonitor published last month a piece of work 
defaultthat 
defaultI think 
defaultit 
defaultcommissioned from McKinsey
default,
default looking at where the productivity potential 
defaultis 
defaultagainst the £
default30 billion—the call for action
default that NHS Engla
defaultnd issued or said is the longer-
defaultterm challenge. The first thing to say is that they could find potential productivity savings of between £10 billion and £18 billion. 
defaultT
defaulthey were saying that you could not get there without one
default&#x2011;
defaultoff savings, both 
defaultin 
defaultpay and big land sales, as to both of which there are questions about feasibility. 
defaultWithin the productivity estimates, their analysis was that most
default, or a bit more than half, 
defaultof the potential
default 
defaultcame from doing what we currently d
defaulto more efficiently—if you like,
default the Olympic cycling team type
default of analysis that says it is about shaving off a second, 
defaultor in their case fractions of a second
default, from 
defaultevery little thing that you do rather than a big bang. There were opportunities, for example, from shifting care into the right settings and integration, but there is still a significant productivity prize in acute hospitals around things like average length of stay 
defaultand
default also a big productivity potential in community 
defaulthealth services and mental health as well. 
defaultThe international evidence—and 
defaultI was just looking at
default EU15—of similar countries
default is that we do not have a very big acute sector by international comparisons. 
defaultO
defaultur bed numb
defaulters per head 
defaultare relatively low. 
defaultI think there are two countries below us, one of which is 
defaultSweden
default,
default which spends much more on social care
default.
default 
defaultA
defaultgain
default,
default the point is that you may save money in one bit but y
defaultou have to spend it elsewhere. We run our system quite hot; 
defaultwe have high bed o
defaultccupancy rates and so on. T
defaulthere is also a need to be realistic. We can almost certainly get better. The McKinsey work points to the fact that we can get better, but it would be a very brave person who thought that you could get better to t
defaulthe scale that we are demanding—
default4% a year on a sustained basis. The lived experience of the NHS this year, when it is starting to get really difficult for quite a lot of people, is that we are probably getting close to the point where 4% is undoable.
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultI agree wit
defaulth what Anita was saying there. As to t
defaulthese list
defaults of what organisations can do—and we produce one as well—of doing more for less
default an
defaultd not more of the same, 
defaultMcKinsey have
default, 
defaultand the Audit Commission used to do tha
defaultt in terms of local authorities.
default If only the bottom 25% could perform at the level of the average, or whatever and
default—
default 
defaultChair:default 
defaultWe have made our own modest contribution to that.
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultYou can generate the numbers. 
defaultL
defaultength of stay is an interesting 
defaultpoint
default. All health systems have been reducing the time people spend in hospital on average
default—
defaultdifferent sorts of medicine and techniques have enabled that
default—
defaultand you can then cost that up a
defaults a saving in a way. 
defaultWhat is a day in hospital? We know how much that costs and 
defaultcan
default multiply 
defaulti
defaultt by 
defaultall 
defaultthe thousands of patients who would be staying less. But
default,
default again
default, that is not really getting at what we
default are 
defaultdoing with that saving.
default It is only a productivity gain if we then do something useful with that. 
defaultA
defaultll of these lists of things to 
defaultdo are depressing in two ways: first
default, they do not really cost it out in a productivity way; and, second
defaultly
default, my experience is that you can identify these things on paper
default,
default but, in reality, there are lots of barriers
default, local circumstances and so on
default that make it difficult to hit the target. As Anita was saying, in fact McKinsey cannot identify, even on paper, the full closing of the £30 billion gap that NHS England now talk
defaults
default about to 2020. 
defaultQ164 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default I
defaults it a published report that McKinsey have
default produced?
defaultAnita defaultCharlesworthdefault: 
default Yes.
defaultQ165 default&#xa0; 
defaultValeriedefault defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultI was taken by your comment that no one seems to know where the money is, so I wondered if you could say whether it is falling within NHS England or the Department of Health
default.
default 
defaultA
defaultre you really saying that no one knows where all the money is and how they can trace it?
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultI am sure there are people who know where it all is. I 
defaultdid not quite mean it like that.
default I meant the reporting
default of it. F
defaultor example, I think the planned saving last year was about £4 billion, so what do we mean by £4 billion? We know 
defaultthat 
defaulta bit of
default it is counted as pay, in fact—a pay saving—because we have a pay freeze, s
defaulto we sort of know where it is, as it were. What is less clear, i
defaultn a sense, is where it has gone:
default 
defaultthat is,
default for instance, 
defaultw
defaulthat did we use that saving for? There was not a lump of money that was then distributed across the NHS and so on. It is that sort of question 
defaultthat
default does not seem to be asked so well
default,
default and the focus has been on the 
default“Shoot first, ask questions later”-
defaulttype approach whe
defaultreby we simply do not give the health s
defaultervice the money. 
defaultAs to
default cutting the tariff for hospitals, they have had a real price cut now of getting on for
default, I think, 
default8%, or will do next year. 
defaultI
defaultt is a real cut in the prices that hospitals get for supplying health
default 
defaultcare to commissioners. In a sense, where has the money gone? I suppose it
default is with the commissioners, but
default 
defaultthe question I would ask is: w
defaulthat have they done with it?
defaultQ166 default&#xa0; 
defaultValeriedefault defaultVazdefault:default Y
defaultou talked about administration costs going up again. Is that because there has been a cut in the number of staff 
defaultand they
default now hav
defaulte 
defaultto be rehired? Was it part of the reorganisation? 
defaultAnita defaultCharlesworthdefault: 
defaultThere may well be a bit of that. 
defaultIt 
defaultis quite difficult fully 
defaultto 
defaultbottom 
defaultw
defaulthat is going on with staff at the moment because all the changes to the NHS are making getting a clear picture of what is going on quite difficult. Some staff have been transferred out of the remit of the work
default 
defaultforce numbers more. But, yes, it does lo
defaultok like there is some rehiring—
defaultwhether 
defaultit is 
defaultrehiring of individuals or filling of other posts. 
defaultAn
defaultother thing that is happening significantly is people substantially overspen
defaultding on agency and bank staff. T
defaulthere is a problem in the system at the moment 
defaultin
default that there are two forms of inefficiency that are being driven by the system. One is the way at the moment 
defaultthat 
defaultpeople are holding back lots of money. 
defaultA
defaultt the beginning of the year
default,
default commissioners are telling acute providers that they are going to reduce demand and so they will not be spending the money with them. Providers have to plan on the basis of what their commissio
defaultners are telling them, and then 
defaultactivity is turning out to be higher than planned 
defaultand 
defaultso they have to fill 
defaultthat 
defaultwith agency staff. That is an inefficient way of delivering services. When year on year that happens to you, you need to look at that and say, 
default“
defaultThat is not good patient care and not a sensible way of running the system.
default”
default 
defaultThe other thing is th
defaulte way that we do the pricing—t
defaulthe way we set prices
default. W
defaulte have deficits turning up in certain types of providers at the moment. We do not really know wh
defaultether those types of providers—
defaultsm
defaultall market town 
defaultacutes
default—
defaultare fundamentally inefficient or whether the way we pay for care is inefficient. Everyone in the NHS says you lose money on normal maternity. Women have to have babies and it costs mon
defaultey to deliver those, so it can’
defaultt be sensible to price the system where everyone loses money on maternity. 
defaultI
defaultf you are a big teaching hospital
default,
default you make money on certain types of, say, cancer care
default,
default and so you can cross
default&#x2011;
defaultsubsidise
default. I
defaultf you do not offer that other service
default,
default then you are just left picking up the pieces
default, but
default you have to deliver the care. 
defaultW
defaulthen we had quite high growth rates you could cope; these sorts of things were not ideal but they did not really bite. We need to get much better at making sure that we understand cost and that we price according to that.
defaultQ167 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultI have a question about 
defaultthe 
defaultintegration of services. I do not know if it is possible to link back to
default what you have just been saying, but w
defaulthat progress has been made in integration and what needs to happen to encourage it at a faster pace? If there are issues whereby funding of social care is either a barrier or a help, if you like, it would be worth mentioning those two
default,
default because, clearly, there are issues there that are not helping
default,
default probably.
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultCan I 
defaultjust 
defaultclarify what you mean by integration?
default Integrating what with what?
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultHealth and social care.
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultIt was a genuine question because it is one of those words that is used a lot now in health
default 
defaultcare
default.
default 
defaultA
defaultre we talking about primary or secondary care, for example?
defaultChair:default 
defaultDavid 
defaultTredinnick
default is not here.
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultOkay, health and social care. I think everybody has recognised for a long time that closer working between health and social care is a must
default,
default and it does happen to an extent
default.
defaultQ168 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default The 
defaultquestion
default is to what extent.
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultI cannot put a number on it, as it were. We know, for example, that hospitals and local authorities do talk to each other. They 
defaulthave joint committees on things
default 
defaultand 
defaultjoint professional working and various other things. That is what I meant by 
default“to an extent”.
default The extent to which it is not integrated is a big joint budget
default,
default out of which comes health and social care. 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default has gone down that route
default,
default but, looking closely at 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default, I would say that just having a joint budget does not guarantee professional working
default.
default 
defaultIf
default we really want to go for integrated health and social care servi
defaultces, which I think we should on quality grounds—
defaultwhether it is saving or more efficient
default,
default I th
defaultink we are not sure about that, to be honest—
defaultit has to be a combination of almost bottom
default&#x2011;
defaultup
default professiona
defaultl working with some top
default&#x2011;
defaultdown
default. I 
defaultdo not think you can legislate for this simply by creating a bud
defaultget. NHS England, the Department
default and the Local Government Association will be grappling with this big pooled budget in 2015
default&#x2011;
default16
default—
defaultnearly £4 billion
default—
defaultand that i
defaults meant to give a bit of a kick-
defaultstart to integration. 
defaultW
defaulte have to wait and see what sort of plans the system comes up with then.
defaultQ169 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultI will 
defaultcome
default back to that in a minute, but it is my view that it is not anything like £4 billion. It is not even the £3.8 billion. We had a question that stated it as £3.8 billion
default, but i
defaultt is only £1.9 billion of new money
default,
default because the rest of it already exists, does it not
default? 
defaultI will 
defaultcome back to that point.
defaultAnita defaultCharlesworthdefault: 
defaultYes. Despite all the pressures, delayed discharges have not gone up, so that is a bit of good news from the joint working. Average length of stay, which is one of the things where
default,
default in NHS numbers
default,
default you see some of the impact of joint working, also is improving. At the moment the big disappointment is that, whatever is happening across the system, however good local initiatives are and 
defaultdespite 
defaultall the goodwill, as to avoiding emergency 
defaultadmissions
default we are not seeing that impacting at scale. 
defaultO
defaultne of the reasons why the system is beginning to see so much of the pressure is that people
default’
defaults plans were very much that they would shift services from acute into out
default&#x2011;
defaultof
default&#x2011;
defaulthospital
default settings and that the out
default&#x2011;
defaultof
default&#x2011;
defaulthospital
default services would be 
defaulta 
defaultpartnership between the NHS and social care. We are not seeing that activity coming down
default;
default so the acute are really struggling with that. We are also seeing disinvestment in real terms in primary care. One of the things, I imagine, 
defaultis that 
defaultfor health and social care to work together effectively you need hospitals and social care
default, but, 
defaultto send someone home or to avoid the admission
default,
default you need the NHS out
default&#x2011;
defaultof
default&#x2011;
defaulthospital
default services to work well together and to work well with social care. As people start to plan, that will be really important as well.
defaultQ170 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultYou talk abou
defaultt disinvestment in primary care. Is there any evidence
default that specific things
default were abolished or slimmed down and that that
default has had an impact? I only 
defaultmainly 
defaultknow my own local area, but it did not seem sensible to me that the PCT, when we had one, closed down two walk
default&#x2011;
defaultin centres and a pilot of active case management
default,
default when active case management seemed to me to be the best way to try to keep people with long
default&#x2011;
defaultterm conditions out of hospital. It seemed to be an insane way to go about efficiency savings, but that is what happened. Is there evidence that that happened more widely?
defaultAnita defaultCharlesworthdefault: 
defaultMonitor has just done its study on walk
default&#x2011;
defaultin cen
defaulttres and we have
default seen quite a lot of those come to an end. 
defaultIts 
defaultanalysis, if I remember correctly, was that the client group for that tended to be an under
default&#x2011;
defaultserved
default client g
defaultroup—a lot of low
default&#x2011;
defaultincome women and so on
default, who probably are not high users of other services so much at the moment, but less the sort of people 
defaultwho 
defaultyou would expect to be impacted
default, such as
default 
defaultthe 
defaultfrail elderly. You hear people talking about initiatives such as the locally enhanced services and directly enhanced services going
default,
default and some of that money was what people were using to support, in primary care, some of the innovation. 
defaultA
defaultgain
default,
default it is an area where
default there is so little good data and i
defaultt is quite difficult, beyond organised anecdote, 
defaultif I can call it that, to turn i
defaultt into hard numbers.
defaultQ171 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultThe 
defaultnext question is about the integration transformation
default fund, to come back to the point with John Appleby, and not £4 billion but probably only
default the 
default£1.9 billion of new funding
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe rest of it, I have from the note
default, is 
defaultthe existing transfer between NHS and social care and things like 
defaultthe disabled f
defaultacil
defaultities grant, 
defaultreablement
default and carers’ breaks,
default which already exist
default. S
defaulto, yes, it is a pooled budget of that size
default,
default but it is not new money. 
defaultT
defaulthe question is about that amount of money
default, i
defaults that going to help
default,
default and
default—
defaultit is almost a leading question
default—is it enough? 
defaultWhat impact is it going to make?
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultIn some sense, none of it is new money. The NHS has been tr
defaultansferring, as you say, up to 
default£1 billion or so to local government anyway. That has just gone. There have been various other budgets 
defaultthat
default the NHS 
defaultor the Department has
default managed
default,
default and then they have been reclassified and they are now over w
defaultith the local authorities and so on.
default 
defaultO
defaultnce you add all these
default up—
defaultand there is 
defaultagain 
defaultan extra £2 billion or so in 2015 of money 
defaultthat has been allocated to the NHS
default which will go into this pooled budget
default—
defaultit is 
default£
default3.8 billion
default, b
defaultut you are right to say, in a sense, that none of it is new money. 
defaultIs it enough? It depends what you want to do with it. We do not know yet what the plans are. CCGs, health and wellbeing boards and 
defaultso on
default have to come up with some plans by next April. I think it is going to vary tremendously around the country. 
defaultT
defaulthere will be some areas 
defaultthat
default will d
defaulto great things with this money and o
defaultthers 
defaultthat 
defaultwill not.
defaultQ172 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultI am 
defaultinterested
default to hear you say that. Is that not rather depressing because is that not where we are just now with integration?
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultYes, of course.
defaultQ173 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultShould there not be more of a blueprint?
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultI have to say that there is a big fear on the part of the NHS that they have just waved goodbye to some of this money. There is a worry. I say it depends, crucially, on what is done with the money, but there will be an opportunity cost. It is money that, as I
default say, was allocated to the NHS, which 
defaultis now going to be spent, in a sense by central direction, on something else and we are not quite sure what that something else is. Presumably
default,
default it is not what it is being spe
defaultnt on now. My question would be,
default what is the opportunity cost of this fund? 
defaultAnita defaultCharlesworthdefault: 
defaultMy anxiety is that planning is happening too late for this and it is happening too late to co
default&#x2011;
defaultordinate with the acute sector
default. This means that a
defaultcute hospitals will need to deliver an efficiency saving in 2015
default&#x2011;
default16 o
defaultf something in the region of 6%.
default 
defaultI
defaultf I look at 
defaultlast year’s cost improvement plans of 
defaultfoundation trusts
default, I think it was
default 3.4%
default,
default and they are declining. Let us assume that this fund is a fantastic success and in 
defaultyear
default pretty much 
defaulteverywhere they implement plans 
defaultthat
default are completely effective
default,
default they save significant numbers of hospital admissions and lead to a big reduction in average length of stay. What you have to do to make the money add up in year is then take all th
defaultat cost out of the acute sector. Hospital costs are lumpy. T
defaulthey are people on fixed employment contracts
default—
defaultprofessional people in the main
default—
defaultand buildings. Taking money out is quite difficult. 
defaultIf this is going to work, 
defaultfirst,
default we need to be sure, especially in areas where the acute sector is very fragile, that the plans are robust, and if you are going to hit the ground running at that speed you need to have planned very early; and then
default, secondly,
default there nee
defaultd 
defaultto be well co
default&#x2011;
defaultordinated plans with the acute sector
default,
default because, essentially, you need to know now broadly how far you are coming down and be planning in a very tightly co
default&#x2011;
defaultordinated way to bring that capacity down. I do not see that. So I think we are at real risk of a very big crisis in the acute sector in that year.
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultJust to localise this in a way, the £2 billion is about £10 million per CCG, roughly. If you want to divide up the £4 billion, you nearly double it, so it is a lot of money locally. 
defaultT
defaulthat is very significant, ju
defaultst to reinforce what Anita said
default about what it means on the ground to local hospitals as well. 
defaultQ174 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Sharma:default 
defaultWe heard 
defaultthe
default terms recently on the reconfigurations. In order to provide funds for integrated services, 
defaultservice 
defaultreconfigurations will be required. We all accept that. Reconfigurations 
defaultthat
default lead to the closure of hospitals or remove services from hospitals
default—such as
default Ealing hospital in my constituency
default—
defaultare notoriously controversial with local communities and can take years to complete. 
defaultThe question is in two phases. 
defaultFirst
default, how can reconfigurations 
defaultthat
default local health economies consider are necessary to preserve and improve the quality and breadth of services in a given area be implemented in a timely way? Second
defaultly
default, will the recommendations of the Keogh review on urgent care, published last week, help to speed up the reconfiguration process more widely? They are lengthy question
defaults
default and I can come back and repeat them.
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultYou are right
default,
default and this links back to where we 
defaultare 
defaultwith productivity
default. T
defaulthe NHS does not serve biscuits at meetings any more
default,
default has low
default&#x2011;
defaultenergy
default light
default bulbs
default and has done all these things. It has done that stuff and has been doing it for years
default,
default and you run out of doing that
default. Y
defaultou then start to look around at how services are provided. There is an area
default—
defaultI will not name it, but you could almost pick any area of the country
default, where—
defaultMr Sharma:default 
defaultPick Ealing.
defaultJohn Applebydefault: I won’t pick Ealing, but 
defaultthere are hospitals 
defaultthat deliver
default 
defaultfewer 
defaultthan 100 births a year. That simply should not be 
defaultgoing on,
default 
defaultfrom the evidence, on
default safety grounds
default, so s
defaultomething has to happen there
default. B
defaultut these are whole hospitals and the co
default&#x2011;
defaultordination of managing th
defaulte
default change
default,
default from that hospital either closing down or doing something different and so on
default,
default has always been 
defaultdifficult, a
defaultnd I am not sure that the NHS has always explained itself and the evidence properly to the public, for example. 
defaultI
defaultt is difficult, I think, and has become more difficult. 
defaultOne of the reasons for that is that in many areas we do not have a co
default&#x2011;
defaultordinating body to oversee some of this stuff. We got rid of strategic health authorities. There may have been some very good reasons to get rid of SHAs, but one of the things they help
defaulted
default 
defaultwith
default was 
defaultto 
defaultco
default&#x2011;
defaultordinate across an area. 
defaultW
defaulte 
defaultnow 
defaulthave 
defaulta more 
defaultfragmented system, in a sense. It is, in a way, 
defaulttypified by the letter that went round the system about the integration transformation fund 
defaultthat was 
defaultsigned by four different bodies. In a way it was good th
defaultat it was signed by 
defaultfour, but it also illustrates what has happened to the system. 
defaultD
defaultoing these things quickly, it seems to me, is still difficult and perhaps more difficult.
defaultAnita defaultCharlesworthdefault: 
defaultTher
defaulte are a couple of things I would say
default. We need to be very clear 
defaultas well 
defaultthat reconfiguration is not the same as merger. There is very little evidence 
defaultthat, if we have organisations that 
defaultare in trouble
default,
default grouping them together does anything other than make the problem bigger and more difficult to fix. There is quite a tradition of that being a solution
default, s
defaulto we need to be very c
defaultlear that it is reconfiguration and underlying service change—
defaultnot just restructuring the provider side
default,
default having restruc
defaulttured the commissioning side. 
defaultS
defaultecond
defaultly,
default we do face some quite difficult tensions as well, don
default’
defaultt we? I should declare that I am a non
default&#x2011;
defaultexecutive
default director on the board of the Whittington in north 
defaultLondon
default and 
defaultfind that, 
defaultwhen you go out and talk to the public
default,
default the trade
default&#x2011;
defaultoff between access and quality is quite difficult
default.
default 
defaultE
defaultspecially as more of our population has chronic disease, access really does matter to people, for com
defaultpletely understandable reasons. So it is about sorting out system-
defaultwide
default, which
default I think plays to John
default’
defaults point
default. O
defaultne of the things that is so good about the Keogh review is 
defaultthat 
defaultit looks at this issue systemically
default,
default rather than dealing with it when it is at crisis point 
defaultin
default an individual hospital
default,
default because there are some quite difficult challenges. 
defaultThe third thing is, of course, that we now have the Bournemouth and 
defaultPoole
default decision from the Competition Commission, so
default,
default even if we all willed it
default,
default we may not legally be able to do it.
defaultChair:default 
defaultThat leads you neatly into your 
defaultnext 
defaultquestion.
defaultQ175 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Sharma:default 
defaultI wa
defaults 
defaulttempted
default to put something else
default but will resist that. Sir David Nicholson has told the Committee
default that 
defaultaspects of the competition framework applied to the NHS were hindering developments intended to improve patient care, and that changes in the law might be needed to make the regime work as intended.  Do you agree with that 
defaultassessment
default?
defaultAnita defaultCharlesworthdefault: 
defaultI have not read all the detail of the Bournemouth and 
defaultPoole
default decision
default,
default so I could not say whether I think the Competition Commission made the right or the wrong decision. It is quite difficult to comment on that case
default,
default and that is the big one to date where competition policy has had a big impact. It is interesting that Monitor is calling in quite a lot of commissioner behaviour
default,
default and, again, it would be 
defaultquite 
defaultimportant to have a good look at what is coming out of that. 
defaultThere are some benefits to the improved rigour. On the point I just made about an awful lot of mergers not delivering, one of the things the Competition Commission in this process has said is, “You need to demonstrate benefit. You need to be very clear about where that benefit is coming from and you need to demonstrate that.” Given that all these reconfigurations cost in money terms and in opportunity costs—the management focus they bring—part of this process is a helpful discipline, but it will mean that the NHS will need to think about what on earth is the alternative if it is not able to do this. I am not a lawyer, but the Competition Commission in its judgment took the case under the Enterprise Act, not the Health and Social Care Act, and it took the case before the Health and Social Care Act was implemented. So there is an interesting issue about whether or not we could change it, because that is an enactment of EU competition law, and whether the genie is out of the bottle now, I don’t know, but certainly on that we cannot go back.
default 
defaultQ176 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultOne of the 
defaultthings
default elected politicians have the power to do, if they choose to use it, is to change the law
default. I guess 
defaultthe question for us is whether the application of the law, wherever it originates
default from 
defaultin 
defaultthis case, delivers good policy.
defaultAnita defaultCharlesworthdefault: 
defaultIndeed. 
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultThe crucial thing, I think, 
defaultis that 
defaultit is the Enterprise Act, not the Health and Social Care Act. It points the finger more at foundation trus
defaultts and their basis as being considered as
default enterprises
default, so 
defaultthat is whe
defaultre you have to look for this. 
defaultThe other thing I would say is it is what the Competition Commission
default—
default  
defaultQ177 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default So
default 
defaulta
defaultre the two Acts in conflict?
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultIn conflict, no, I do not think so. What I meant was that that is
default—
defaultQ178 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultSo in future they could have taken it under either.
defaultAnita defaultCharlesworthdefault:
default Yes, I think so.
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultFTs are considered as enterprises and 
defaultthey 
defaultcome under the Enterprise Act, according to EU procurement law
default 
defaultand competition law
default, so that is the issue
default. That is where the real issue lies. I do not think we should necessarily accept that 
defaultthe OFT, CC and, or soon to become, the—
defaultwhat is it called
default?—
defaultCMA
default—
default 
defaultAnita defaultCharlesworthdefault: 
defaultThe merger of the two.
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultYes
default; 
defaultI do not know wh
defaulto is looking into that merger! 
defaultThey have to learn their job as well, by the way, so it is not something that is committed in stone from right at the beginning. If you talk to the Competition Commission and OFT, they have to get to grips with an industry
default,
default and they are learning, I think, with the health
default 
defaultcare industry. 
defaultD
defaultecisions will change over time as they learn how, in a sense, to do their job
default, b
defaultut essentially their task is, for example, 
default“
defaultDo the benefits of a merger
default,
default which reduces competition
default,
default outweigh the loss of competition?
default”
default They do not have to prove that competition is a benefit, by the way; that is simply a given. I would agree with Anita that it is pushing the NHS to think more deeply and harder about the cases it has to make to the public, 
defaultthe Competition Commission
default and so on, for why we should have mergers, a reconfiguration or a significant change in the way a service is provided. Frankly, it has not 
defaultalways 
defaultbeen that good in the past at doing that. From that point of view, there is a benefit.
defaultQ179 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew Percy:default We 
defaultsay
default it has all been useful
default and the case builds, but I have two questions 
defaulton this reconfiguration issue
default. One, what is your assessment of the politics of all this and the political debate? We hear politicians on all sides saying, 
default“
defaultTo respond to the incredible challenge there is in the NHS we are going to have to have reconfigurations,
default”
default but the moment the reconfiguration drops on the ground, particularly if it is in a marginal constituency, it becomes incredibly political and
default it will not happen, or it may
default happen but it becomes impossible for politicians to support it. 
defaultW
defaulthat 
defaultis 
defaultyour assessment 
defaultas to
default the damage that this kind of politicisation of ev
defaultery change in the NHS is having?
default 
defaultSecond
defaultly
default, we all understand, as Virendra said, about the need for reconfigurations
default,
default but it makes me nervous
default because the 
defaultconstituency 
defaultI represent 
defaultis 257 square miles
default,
default spread across two different counties
default,
default and if they reconfigure services in my trust that means that people where I live have to 
defaulttravel 60 miles to 
defaultGrimsby
default to access some of those services. That is not a local hospital and 
defaultit then 
defaulthas a huge impact on access. 
defaultW
defaulthen we talk about reconfiguration, the examples 
defaultthat
default are ofte
defaultn presented are urban examples—o
defaultkay, you may have to go from one bit of London to another or from the north of Leic
defaultester to the south of Leicester—and 
defaultI am 
defaultreally 
defaultconcerned about where all this is going to end up for those of us in rural communities. I can see a situation where clinicians turn up, tell the local community that this is thoroughly the right and best thing for them do
default,
default and their services disappear 60 miles away, which then make them completely and utterly inaccessible.
default W
defaulthen we talk about this, I have not heard anybody saying, 
default“
defaultWhat is the answer for people living in those rural and very isolated communities?
default”
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultThe first thing to say is that we should not assume that reconfig
defaulturation is about centralisation; it sometimes is, 
defaultbut it sometimes is not. In fact, 
defaultI thought 
defaultLord 
defaultAra
default 
defaultDarzi
default’
defaults
default review 
defaultHealthcare for London
default 
defaulttoo
defaultk a very interesting line. The
default strap
default&#x2011;
defaultline
default was something like
default,
default 
default“Localise 
defaultwhere 
defaultpossible, 
defaultcentralise where 
defaultnecessary.”
default 
defaultT
defaulthe view it was taking was a sort of 
defaultsubsidiar
defaultit
defaulty
default view, if I can draw that analogy.
defaultAndrew Percy:default 
defaultThat has hardly been successful.
defaultChair:default 
defaultYou are not winning the argument with Mr Percy.
defaultJohn Applebydefault: Maybe scratch that analogy. 
defaultSome services are much better provided face to face in people
default’s homes; o
defaultther services are better provided at a GP
default’s surgery
default and so on. That is the approach that all medical health
default 
defaultcare systems have gone through and it is about trying to get that balance right. My first po
defaultint would be,
default 
defaulton reconfiguration, 
defaultdo not necessarily assume it is about centralisation. There is a trade
default&#x2011;
defaultof
defaultf in bigger rural areas—
defaultof course. In a sense, for good reason, we do not have MRI scanners on the 
defaultIsle of Skye
default, I don’t think, 
defaultbecause we recognise that the expense of doing that is just too great, but in another sense it is also unfair because people who live there have to travel a long way. My father lives in Devon and has to travel a long way to get 
defaultto hospital; 
defaultI live in 
defaultLondon
default where there is one on every corner virtually. 
defaultT
defaulthere are these trade
default&#x2011;
defaultoffs
default,
default and I do not think the NHS could completely resolve thos
defaulte. It has to do the best it can
default given 
defaultthe 
defaultpattern of services.
defaultAnita defaultCharlesworthdefault: 
defaultThe 
defaultAra
default 
defaultDarzi
default London experience i
defaults quite important because “L
defaultocalise where possible,
default centralise where necessary” is a really important message,
default but
default,
default once you say that
default,
default what people see is the 
default“
defaultcentralise
default”; what they don’t see is the
default 
default“
defaultlocalise
default”
default. When I look at the numbers, in terms of where the spending has gone, certainly if primary care is part of the 
default“
defaultlocalise
default”
default, the money is not getting there
default.
default 
defaultU
defaultnderstandably, if you are a member of the public
default, you would ask,
default 
default“W
defaulthat does this localised better service look like? How do I judge it? How do I even see and feel 
defaultthat 
defaultit is still there and you have 
defaultnot cut it from underneath me?” 
defaultWe have put comparatively little eff
defaultort, I would argue, as a system,
default into describing, modelling and then showing people what the 
default“
defaultlocalise
default”
default is
default,
default and then working out a way 
defaultthat
default communities can judge whether it is being delivered and hold
defaulting
default people to account for it. In that environment, it is logical for local communities to feel great nervousness about what they are losing
default,
default when what they are supposedly gaining is so amorph
defaulto
defaultus. 
defaultT
defaulto my mind
default,
default the thing that would make the biggest difference would be to work out what the 
default“
defaultlocal
default”
default means and to provide good transparency and accountability so that people could have some confidence in that before they let go of what they feel is a loss.
defaultQ180 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew Percy:default 
defaultThat is important. At my local hospital we lost all acute admissions because of safety concerns
default,
default and, in terms of that, we have had various diagnostics bought
default—MRI scanners, 
defaulteye c
defaultlinics and all the rest of that—but people do not see that, 
defaultand the NHS is dreadful at making the case around it. I still come back to the point that that is fine, but when your stroke service
default goes—
defaultthey might say
default,
default 
default“
defaultOnce you are out of the acute phase, we will take 
defaultyou back to your local hospital”—and you need 
defaultthrombolysing
default 
defaultand all the rest of it
default,
default and that 
defaulthappens 
default40 or 50 miles away
default but 
defaultit used to happen at your local hospital, it is a massive loss of service.  
defaultChair:default 
defaultIt did not
default happen
default.
defaultAndrew Percy:default 
defaultIt did in my case, but it has gone
default—or, rather, i
defaultt has come to mine
default,
default but has gone from somebody else
default’
defaults.
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultThere is not an easy answer to this, and I was trying to make the point that 
defaultever 
defaultsince the NHS came into existence it has been struggling with a historic
defaultal
default pattern of services
default,
default and it is, on cost terms, unreasonable to provide the sort of access that somebody would get in the capital of the country. 
defaultT
defaulthat is just how it is.
defaultQ181 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew Percy:default Y
defaultou have 
defaultboth
default neatly avoided my invitation to condemn politicians for their role in this reconfiguration.
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultWe are economists.  
defaultQ182 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew Percy:default 
defaultThis is my concern about 
defaultover
default 
defaultthe next 18 months. Some of this stuff probably needs to happen
default,
default but we are going to see one hell of a political fight over the ne
defaultxt few months on the ground when
defaultever there is any proposal to reconfigure a service, so I do not know how it is possibly going to be delivered.
defaultAnita defaultCharlesworthdefault: 
defaultI come back to my point that these are the services that rea
defaultlly matter to local communities.
default I do not buy the argument that you could take the politics out of this. They 
defaultreally 
defaultmatter to people. 
defaultT
defaulthere has to be more of a sort of deal or an informal contract. The NHS has to give politicians a better case to defend
default—
defaulta better
default&#x2011;
defaultmade
default case and a better overall case
default—
defaultand then, in exchange for that, people have to be prepared to support 
defaulti
defaultt where possible. 
defaultT
defaulthere are examples where that is happening
default,
default but it has to be a really good
default,
default strong case, has it not, which has to focus as much on the 
default“
defaultlocalise
default”
default as the 
default“
defaultcentralise
default”
default to be a credible offer for most people
default?
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultIt is difficult to comment on the politics, but you have to recognise that 
defaultthere are going to be losers, or that people will feel some loss
default in some of these dec
defaultisions, 
defaultand there will be gains. That is a very hard thing to present to people, especially the losers. In a sens
defaulte, how do you compensate them? 
defaultMaybe you cannot, but you can point out that maybe their safety will improve because the sy
defaultstem has been centralised a bit. B
defaultut I recognise the dilemma
default and i
defaultt is difficult.
defaultQ183 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew Percy:default 
defaultBut 
defaultexplaining
default to Mrs Smith how she would be better treated 60 miles away 
defaultrather 
defaultthan 
defaulta
defaultround the corner is an argument we cannot win often.
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultAnother solution is to put more money into the system and then you simply say, 
default“
defaultWe will pay for that access.
default”
default 
defaultQ184 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultBut before we go too far 
defaultdown
default that road, just putting more money into a system does not make it possible to have efficient stroke units with proper staffing on every street corner, does it?
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultNo. You would have to put a hell of a lot of money in to do that. I do recognise that, but that is a potential
default—
default  
defaultChair:default You would have a lot of
default stroke specialists on the bea
defaultch for quite a lot of the time.
defaultQ185 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Wollaston:default Have
default you made any assessment of the total cost of all the legal challenges and how much that has increased 
defaultsince
default the Health and Social Care Act, although I am interested that you say it
default is actually the Enterprise Act?
default Has there been a remorseless rise in the cost of litigation around these challenges?
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultIn Bournemouth and 
defaultPoole
default,
default they quote themselves 
defaulthow much they have spent, and it is
default something like £5 million to £6 million.
defaultAnita defaultCharlesworthdefault: 
defaultOn advisers.
defaultQ186 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Wollaston:default That is 
defaultBournemouth
default and 
defaultPoole
default between them.
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultJust Bournemouth and 
defaultPoole
default have spent
default £5 million to £6 million in terms of preparing thei
defaultr case, advisers, legal advice and 
defaulteconomic competition advice.
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultThat is a lot of doctors. 
defaultQ187 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Wollaston:default 
defaultHas 
defaultanyone
default made an assessment nationally as to how much is being spent on legal advice for these reconfigurations?
defaultAnita defaultCharlesworthdefault: 
defaultNo.
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultI am not aware
default of that
default.
defaultAnita defaultCharlesworthdefault: 
defaultThat data is not routinely collected so, at the moment
default,
default you would have to ask everybody, I guess with 
defaulta freedom of i
defaultnformation
default request
default, to tell you. 
defaultY
defaultou cannot see that in people
default’
defaults accounts.
defaultQ188 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Wollaston:default Y
defaultou would 
defaulthave
default to send an FOI to every single foundation trust that was thinking
default—
default 
defaultAnita defaultCharlesworthdefault: T
defaulthat is the only way I could get it. There
default may be other avenues but, for me to get it, 
defaultthat is what I would have to do, yes.
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultPerhaps I could also say that it is not simply
default 
defaultmoney out the door to consultants. It is also the opportunity costs of managers
default’ time 
defaultand commissioners
default’
default time spent in meetings and so on
default,
default which does not, in a sense, appear in the accounts as
default,
default 
default“This is what it cost us.”
default 
defaultI
defaultt is 
defaultsometimes quite 
defaultdifficult 
defaulteven 
defaultfor organisations 
defaultthemselves
default to know quite how much they have spent on this sort of thing.
defaultQ189 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Wollaston:default 
defaultOn a slightly 
defaultlinked
default issue, we have had evidence from Monitor saying that too many CCGs are putting things out to tender when in fact they could be making a judgment around integration trumping competition in patients
default’
default best interests and avoiding that route. Have 
defaultyou made any assessment of the costs of these unnecessary tendering operations
default? I
defaults 
defaultit your view
default that it is a waste of money
default,
default and is there any financial evidence that we can use to persuade CCGs not to do this quite so often?
defaultAnita defaultCharlesworthdefault: 
defaultThe cost of the tendering process should be part of the decision making. It is not the only one. The issue that Monitor
default’
defaults point
defaults highlight
default is that the
defaultse are really complex decisions, such as, “
defaultIs this a service? How do we configure this service?
default”
default 
defaultF
defaultirst of all
default,
default you have 
defaultto have 
defaulta really good understanding of your needs, how your service is doing at the moment, what the different options are for that service, 
defaultwhat the marketplace looks like and
default the capacity of your current providers versus alternative providers
default. T
defaulthen you need to run a procurement
default process
default. 
defaultT
defaulthat first bit is the sort of thing that I think good commissioners
default would do. I
defaultt is commissioning, is it not? In essence, it is the point of commissioning. If you do that well
default,
default you decide whether 
defaultto
default run a tendering process or not and whether the potential benefits from the tendering process outweigh the costs of going through that process. 
defaultThe problem is the immaturity of the commissioning environment so, in essence, 
defaultit is 
defaultthe clash between a se
defaultnse that they have legally 
defaultto do all 
defaultthis tendering to be compliant, 
defaultyet, in very many cases, all 
defaultt
defaulthat prior good deep commissioning work around these services is probably not there. If you tender a service where you have not done the prior work
default,
default you are almost certainly not going to have an effective tendering process. 
defaultT
defaulthere is a real issue about whether there should be something of a moratorium while they say, across the system
default, that 
defaultpeople
default ought to be spending this year and maybe next year
default 
defaultestablishin
defaultg the core building blocks of being a good commissioner
default.
default 
defaultA
defaultt the end of that they 
defaultwould
default probably 
defaultbe 
defaultin a position to tender. There will be some exceptions to that where there are particular local imperatives, but that is the real issue. 
defaultAt the moment w
defaulte have a system that
default,
default if it were going to work
default,
default requires immense sophistication of commissioning at a point where the commissioning system is just trying to work out whether it 
defaulthas the data in the right place and 
defaultknows what bills it is and 
defaultit 
defaultis not responsible for. It is focused on sorting out the transactional stuff. The strategic stuff feels a long way away.
default 
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultI have one
default—
default 
defaultChair:default 
default 
defaultYes, q
defaultuickly
default,
default 
defaultbecause
default I have one eye on the clock.
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultVery quickly, looking at Monitor and what 
defaultit 
defaultcan do
default,
default I agree that people are learning their roles here and I feel that Monitor could be provi
defaultding more advice, for example. 
defaultCCGs are quite fragile organisations in many respects in terms of their capabilities, skills and so on. It is easy to see how they may react to things
default by saying
default, 
default“
defaultWe must do this,
default”
default when in fact they do not quite know. 
defaultM
defaulty recommendation would be that Monitor could perhaps take on more of an advisory role here
default,
default and
default in fact it has done. The Co
defaultoperation and Competition Panel, which it has absorbed, used to try and advertise, 
default“
defaultCome to us first. If you think of a merger, come to us first and we can talk about it and give you some advice.
default”
default 
defaultQ190 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default We are going to be 
defaultseeing
default Dr Bennett next week, so we might 
defaulttake that advice up with him. 
defaultCan I move us on
default,
default because one of the things Anita 
defaultCharlesworth
default just said was that maybe we should t
defaultake two years to get the system 
defaultmoving
default?
default One of the problems that increasingly seems 
defaultto be
default coming to the fore is the danger of developing 
defaultburning platforms,
default particular
defaultly
default on the provider side, and
default increasing numbers of trusts—
defaultfoundation 
defaultand non
default&#x2011;
defaultfoundation
default trusts—
defaultreporting 
defaultdeficits. The Committee would be interested to know your perception of where that process has got to and what the one to two
default&#x2011;
defaultyear term looks like 
defaultregarding 
defaultthe emerging deficits in trusts.
defaultAnita defaultCharlesworthdefault: My view on this is that w
defaulte have a fair degree of stability, if you look at the underlying numbers
default—
defaultthe NAO strips out all this support that was floating around the system
default—with
default slightly 
defaultover 
default40 trusts that were in deficit by the end of 2012
default&#x2011;
default13, 
defaultwhich is 
defaultfairly similar to the 2011
default&#x2011;
default12 position. Despite all the focus on some of those
default,
default we are finding it 
defaultvery 
defaultdifficult to resolve those issues
default,
default and progress is much slower on resolution than 
defaultwe had
default thought. 
defaultT
defaulthe big risk now is 
defaultthat 
defaultit looks like we are going from a minority position, albeit quite a big number, to something that looks much more systemic. Monitor looked at the impact assessment of 
defaultthe 
defaultpayment system. If pay and prices turn out as 
defaultit 
defaultexpect
defaults
default next year and
default the NHS delivers 3% efficiency
default rather than 4%, with no extra cost pressures from things like Franc
defaultis and Keogh, 45% of acute trusts
default would be in deficit
default.
default 
defaultThat is the
default estimate. So we have a system now that feels 
defaultas if
default, for an awful lot of providers, they are 
defaultat 
defaulta tipping point. 
defaultT
defaulthere was a strategy development that said 
defaultthat 
defaultdeficit would be a rare thing and what we would do is send in 
defaulta
default team, work out 
defaulta
default local solution, put a huge amount of effort in and bring 
defaultyou
default out as a sustainable organisation. It looks like it is going to be a very common thing
default—we do not really know—and 
defaultthere is not a plan, I think, for it being a very common thing.
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultFor quarter 1 this year
default,
default I think Monitor report
defaults
default 
defaultthat 48—
defaultmainly acute
default—
defaulttrusts are in deficit compared 
defaultwith
default 36 in quarter 1 last year, so the numbers are creeping up. The 
defaultTrust Development A
defaultuthority
default 
defaultreport
defaults
default 31 trusts planning a deficit by the end of this year, and that is up by 
defaultfive 
defaultsince the beginning of the year. 
defaultT
defaulthese are still a minority
default,
default but they are a significant group. I would emphasise 
defaultthat 
defaultthis large group of foundation trusts is what
default Monitor will call the S
default&#x2011;
defaultcurve
default. What is the surplus? What is the deficit?
default 
defaultY
defaultou have a small group making quite big surpluses and a smallish group making deficits or losses. You have a big group 
defaultthat is 
defaulthovering by fractions of a per cent
default—
defaultin many cases
default,
default just above 0%. It 
defaultwould
default 
defaultnot take much pressure on them—
defaultfor example a reduction in the prices that they get for thei
defaultr goods and services and so on—and you could 
defaultexpect
default that,
default 
defaultfor 
defaultquite a lot to tip over into deficit. 
defaultT
defaulthe short term at the moment does look quite grim. 
defaultMonitor would say that it is not a crisis
default,
default but 
defaultit would leave 
defaultthat 
default“
defaultyet
default”
default sort of hanging in the air. It is very difficult. Again, talk to trusts and they will say they are feeling very big pressures
default,
default and come 2015
default&#x2011;
default16, 
defaultwhich is not that far away now—a year and a bit—it could be, picking 
defaultvarious
default metaphors, a 
defaultturning point, watershed
default or
default cliff edge
default,
default 
defaultbecause the money is not 
defaultcompl
defaultetely coming out of the system, but 
defaultthe pressure on the hospital sector, in particular
default, 
defaultcould be such as to tip a lot of trusts over into deficit. 
defaultQ191 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultRelated
default to the ITF.
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultYes.
defaultQ192 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultCould
default I, because of time
default,
default wrap up a number of questions in one? To what extent is that pattern of increased numbers of deficits 
defaultin 
defaultfoundation and other trusts the result
default of the alleged cherry-
defaultpicking that has been going on of many procedures by private hospitals or private providers, particularly for elective procedures? To what extent 
defaultare 
defaultthose substantial private alternative providers of elective surgeries
default and 
defaultelective procedures themselves facing deficits, or are there none? 
defaultT
defaulthe chief financial officer of the trust and its main competitor
default,
default which 
defaultsits on its doorstep, got together in my own area and looked
default through the very complex
default tariff system. 
defaultI do not know whether either of the two of you have looked at 
defaultit,
default 
defaultbut 
defaultyou certainly need a long time in a darkened room with a wet towel
default,
default and 
defaultyou 
defaultprobably need your head tested at the end of it a
defaults it is the most complex system.
default I am not sure that many follow the tariff system and claim for every ele
defaultment that is available to them. T
defaulto what extent do you think that
default it is
default 
defaultnot 
defaultthe tariff system 
defaultthat
default is causing the difficulty for a lot of acute trusts
default, but 
defaultthe winter pressures
default?
default 
defaultAlso,
default is the Government
default’
defaults £250 million additional fund going to be sufficient to help those trusts that are u
defaultnder this financial pressure? I am s
defaultorry to have lumped that al
defaultl 
defaulttogether, but I am aware of time.
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultI can give one
default&#x2011;
defaultword
default answers if you like. 
defaultT
defaulthe first one 
defaultis
default no. 
defaultAs to
default the second one, I cannot quite remember 
defaultwhat 
defaultthe question
default was
default. The tariff was the third question, I think.
defaultQ193 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultOkay. It 
defaultwas
default about the private providers, so your answer to that is that
default you are not aware of it.
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultI do not think 
defaultso; I do not think 
defaultthat is a major issue in this.
default Is the tariff too complicated? 
defaultYes, it is quite complicated. The real issue with the tariff and some of the othe
defaultr 
defaultwagglings
default of the price lever—
defaultfor example, hospitals being paid 
defaultonly 
default30% of the tariff for emergency ad
defaultmissions above a certain level—is 
defaultthat 
defaultit 
defaulthas hit nearly all hospitals
default,
default because we have seen a rise in emergency admi
defaultssions. That has contributed. 
defaultAs to the £250 million, 
defaultit is now 
default£150 million on top of that apparently going in, so 
defaultit is 
default£400 million. It is probably too little too late. There is a colleague of mine
default—
default 
defaultQ194 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultI am sorry, 
defaultbut 
defaultthe
default additional £150 million had escaped me.
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultI saw it announced in the 
defaultHealth Service Journal
default today that on top of the £250 million there is another £150 million. I have no idea where that money is coming from, by the way, but I think it is as a result o
defaultf complaints by a lot of trusts, which
default said, 
default“
defaultWhy are you rewarding failure?
default”
default That is one way of looking at it, I guess. Anyway, that money, it seems to me, is too little too late. As a colleague of mine, Nigel Edwards, would say, 
default“
defaultYou have to start planning for winter in February.
default”
default You have to have a really long view on these things. I should point out that this is what the N
defaultHS has done for a lot of years: it has found
default a few hundred million at this time of 
defaultthe 
defaultyear in winter to keep things going. 
defaultI
defaultt is not an uncommon thing, but it does seem to go against the general thrust of what the Health and Social Care 
defaultAct 
defaultis about
default—
defaultthe general movement
default, independence and 
defaultso on
default—to say, “
defaultHere is a bit of extra cash to keep you going.
default”
default But I think it is too little too late.
defaultQ195 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultDo you 
defaultthink
default that the current review of the tariff
default&#x2011;
defaultbased
default system can ever get the satisfactory equilibrium to drive 
defaultcherry-picking out of the system—or, rather, 
defaultthe 
defaultallegation that there is cherry-
defaultpi
defaultcking going on
default out of the system?
defaultAnita defaultCharlesworthdefault: Within the cherry-
defaultpicking there are two things. One is that 
defaultnon
default&#x2011;
defaultNHS providers—
defaultthe voluntar
defaulty sector and private providers—
defaulthave become a much bigger part of the delivery of care over the 
defaultp
defaultast five years. 
defaultW
defaulte have doubled the amount of the NHS budget spent with them. If they are delivering that efficiently and delivering high quality, in one sense, does tha
defaultt matter? In terms of cherry-
defaultpicking, if it is priced 
defaultrightly
default so that they are efficient and high quality, does it matter? I guess it might still matt
defaulter if you have what is called 
defaultstranded capacity—if you have capacity in the NHS
default 
defaultthat
default you are paying for
default,
default but are struggling to afford that higher level of activity. It is becoming quite a significant amount of money. 
defaultAs to the tariff system—
defaultthe Committee, I think you said, 
defaulthas 
defaultseen last year
default’
defaults rep
defaultort and it is really important—it 
defaultdoes not deliver efficiency. It does not change any of the financials of the NHS. 
defaultIt
default says whose job it is to drive out that efficiency. Where the tariff matters, I think, is that we set it correctly so that we price things properly 
defaultto
default reflect the cost
default,
default but not too much. My concern at the moment is this. People spend a lot of time worrying about whether we should bundle more things up into the tariff and things like that, but we should worry a lot about whether we are setting the prices right. If we do things 
defaultsuch as
default systematically 
defaultunderprice
default maternity, we will lead 
defaultto 
defaultpeople be
defaulting
default in difficulty who 
defaultmight 
defaultbe perfectly efficient. Equally, if we overprice some bits of complex surgery
default,
default we will make people look very good financially 
defaultwhen
default actually they could be very inefficient. That does not help the system overall
default; i
defaultt means that where the problems emerge may not reflect what is underlying
default them
default. So I would like much more focus on getting the prices right.
defaultChair:default 
defaultCan we move on?
default 
defaultQ196 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault: defaultAs to the 
defaultextra
default amount of money, was it £150 million? 
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultApparently. I saw it in
default a news story reported in the 
defaultHealth Service Journal
default today.
defaultQ197 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultIs this 
defaulton
default top of the £250 million that the Secretary of State announced
default—
default 
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultApparently, yes.
defaultQ198 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultAs 
defaultfor 
defaultthe 
defaultwinter
default crises that you mentioned
default 
defaultover the past two years
default, do you
default think this £250 million
default has anything to do with
default them being 
defaultin crisis because of what is happening with the NHS funding?
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultI think it is extreme worry about what is going to happ
defaulten in A and E over the winter t
defaulthat has prompted this.
defaultQ199 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultThis extra £150 
defaultmillion
default on top of the £250 million.
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultYes. The £250 million is about A and E
default,
default and this is also about A and E
default, 
defaultso it is a barometer of worry.
defaultQ200 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew Percy:default Some
default 
defaulttrusts
default were not allocated any
default money.
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultYes, exactly, and there have been quite a lot of complaints from trusts next door to each other
default where
default one got some money and another did not
default,
default and there was an argu
defaultment about that.
default 
defaultQ201 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultSo 
defaultwherever
default this money is coming from, do you think this is as a result, over the last two years, of the difficulties that there have been in NHS funding generally that they face?
defaultJohn Applebydefault: I
defaultt has happened
default,
default in my experience
default,
default in the NHS virtually every year since its existence in some sense. There has always been somebo
defaultdy who has a back pocket somewhere—good finance people always do, 
defaultas it were, and
default—
default 
defaultQ202 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default But as 
defaultmuch
default as this—£250 million?
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultIt is around this sort of figure, yes, and it happened
default,
default I think
default, the year before and 
defaultthe year before last. It is announced in different ways. Sometimes i
defaultt is announced as an initiative;
default sometimes it is simply 
defaultjust 
defaultdistributed throughout the system.
defaultChair:default 
defaultSometimes it is not announced. We have a quick question from Andrew on allocations and then we need to move on to the second panel.
defaultQ203 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultThe allocation of resources currently is a hot debating issue. Are you satisfied that the balance is right in relation to areas with deprivation against those with an older age profile
default,
default bearing in mind that the actual allocation
defaults themselves have always lagged, or, 
defaultrather
default,
default the pace of change 
defaulthas always been incredibly slow?
default Do you think this is a rather pointless exercise anyway because they are not going to be moving at any great pace towards their target, are they? Or are they not?
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultThey are not. What you are referring to is the way we allocate money centrally to areas across the country. We do have the most sophisticated formula for allocating public money in the world, I think. The number of econometrician person hours that has gone into developing this very complex formula is almost unbelievable.
defaultQ204 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultIs 
default“
defaultsophisticated
default”
default a synonym for complex?
defaultJohn Applebydefault: I
defaultt is complex
default,
default but it is also sophisticated 
defaultaccording to 
defaultthe meaning of the word 
default“
defaultsophisticated
default”
default. I am not just using it as a synonym. There have been arguments going back to the mid
default&#x2011;
default1970s in local areas. When I worked in the health service
default,
default we had a standing committee 
defaultin 
defaultthe region 
defaultthat
default would deal with arguments locally about who got how much according to the formula. It is a sort of no
default&#x2011;
defaultwin situation, I think, and at the moment there is no real extra money to reallocate
default,
default so everything has ground to a halt in terms of any change. 
defaultThere are quite big differences. Is it 
defaultManchester
default that gets about 1.6 or 1.8 times more money than 
defaultOxford
default, for example? That is what the formula produces, if you like. There have been arguments 
defaultabout making
default it much simpler
default,
default and 
defaultthat 
defaultthe sophistication is a sort of over
default&#x2011;
defaultsophistication
default and it is just over
default-
defaultcomplex. 
defaultSo, y
defaultes, 
defaultit is 
defaulta bit of deprivation, mainly driven by age and population size. In fact, the extra that the sort of deprivation and other factors add over and above taking just the population and the age structure is not that much. It is 
defaulta 
defaultvery small amount of difference. 
defaultQ205 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Wollaston:default 
defaultCan I come back 
defaulton
default this? The other issue for rural areas, of course, is the cost of delivering services 
defaultthere
default. 
defaultSparsity
default is not factored in at all
default,
default and yet you can have a population of very high need because they have such an elderly health profile
default, which
default makes it very difficult for them to provide resources. Just looking at the issue of section 136s and places of safety, there is 
defaultjust 
defaultno provision
default,
default effectively
default,
default in some rural areas
default,
default which is why they have such high use of police cells. Is that an issue that you think needs to be addressed? 
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultIt is partly an empirical matter about what the differences 
defaultare 
defaultin cost. For example, there is a so
default&#x2011;
defaultcalled market forces factor
default,
default which tries to take account of the different costs of labour employing people in different parts of the country. 
defaultS
defaultalaries in 
defaultLondon
default are higher, 
defaultbecause it is 
defaultLondon
default, 
defaultand the
defaultre is some compensation for the
default south
default&#x2011;
defaulteast. Similarly
default,
default there may well be a case for a sort of 
defaultrurality
default or 
defaultsparsity
default&#x2011;
defaulttype
default payment. All you would be 
defaultdoing is taking a bit more money out of 
defaultLondon
default to do that, I would suggest, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. It is an empirical matter, I think.
defaultAnita defaultCharlesworthdefault: 
defaultCan I add one thing? 
defaultA
defaultn awful lot of work and energy goes into the formula
default,
default but I think, especially now, when resources are so constrained, 
defaultthere has been 
defaultmuch less focus 
defaulton how you implement the formula and
default how you make change happen. There are two things there. One of the things that happened routinely was that you got your allocation and
default,
default if you were a growth area
default,
default you were then set something called a control total
default,
default which was what bit of your allocation you were allowed to spend, which was agreed. By and large
default,
default that meant 
defaultthat, 
defaultif you were a growth area
default,
default you had most of that differential growth taken away because someone else might need to be bailed out. 
defaultT
defaulthen you think
default,
default 
default“W
defaulthat was the point of the allocations process?
default”
default 
defaultW
defaulte need to decide how we are going to do resource allocation
default, which
default is informed by good empirical work but is significantly a policy question
default. B
defaultut then
default,
default if you do not align the rest of the system to it and work out how you are going to move out around real r
defaultesources, people, buildings and so on
default, you end up back where we were
default,
default where people have a theoretical allocation and then the reality of their control total
default,
default which just undermines all the credibility and discipline in the system and is counter
default-
defaultproductive.
defaultJohn Applebydefault: 
defaultThere has been some work
default done by two economists, Professor 
defaultMatt Sutton 
defaultat 
defaultManchester
default 
defaultand Professor Nigel Rice
default 
defaultat 
defaultYork
default, looking at the impact of the weighted capitation system going back to 1970. Their conclusion, in
default a nutshell, is that it
default has done almost nothing in terms of the central objective, which is equal opportunity of access for those in equal need, which was the starting point for the original working party
default, RAWP
default. 
defaultW
defaulte have had over 30 years of moving billions of pounds around t
defaulthe country, but, as Anita points
default out
default, you give with one hand and take with another. There is no
default real
default—
default 
defaultQ206 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultWe 
defaulthave
default had 30 years when we have talked about it
default,
default but we have not actually moved the cash. That is the key point, is it not?
defaultAnita defaultCharlesworthdefault: Y
defaultes.
defaultChair:default Okay. 
defaultOn that note, thank you very much for coming once again. I suspect you will be back on anot
defaulther occasion. Thank you.
defaultWitnesses:
default 
defaultMatt Teedefault, Chief Operating Officer, NHS Confederation, 
defaultCouncillor Katie Halldefault, Chair, Community Wellbeing Board, and 
defaultAndrew Websterdefault, Associate Director of Health and Care Integration, Local Government Association, gave evidence.
defaultQ207 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultThank you 
defaultvery
default much. Thank you for waiting patiently during the previous session. I think I am right in saying that Andrew Webster has been before but Katie Hall 
defaulthas 
defaultnot
default.
default Could I ask you very briefly to introduce yourselves in your current roles?
defaultMatt Teedefault: 
defaultI am Matt Tee and I am the chief operating officer of the NHS Confederation.
defaultCouncillor Halldefault: 
defaultI am Katie Hall, chair of the Local Government Association
default’
defaults Community Wellbeing Board.
defaultAndrew Websterdefault: 
defaultI am Andrew Webster, director for integrated care at the Local Government Association. 
defaultQ208 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultThank you very much. I would like to begin, if I may, by going straight into the same basic question that I asked the previous panel of witnesses. In the NHS context, it tends to be referred to as the Nicholson challenge, partly because that is what we in this Committee have called it
default, but the efficiency challenge—
defaultthe requirement to deliver care from a budget that is, at best, frozen in real terms in the NHS
default,
default and reducing in 
defaultmany parts of local government—
defaultis the core challenge across the health and care system
default.
default I would like to hear each of your views as to how we ar
defaulte getting on with that process—
defaultboth where we have got to but, more importantly, what it 
defaultwill feel
default like over the next two years and looking forward int
defaulto the second half of the decade.
defaultMatt Teedefault: 
defaultIt feels tough. 
defaultI would say that 20%
default of our members say this is the worst financial situation they have seen in their time in the health service, and we have
default some very long
default&#x2011;
defaultserving
default people. So far, it feels to me
default 
defaultthat
default what the health service has done is the relatively easier parts of taking money out. 
defaultT
defaulthe health service has unquestionably been helped by the effective pay freeze for the last couple of years. Experience tells us that after a pay freeze finishes
default,
default pay bounces back again to a degree. 
defaultAs to t
defaulthe changes that we have heard about already in terms of estate a
defaultnd one
default&#x2011;
defaultoff money coming from that, and
default 
defaultthe 
defaultslimming down of management costs, we are getting to the end point
default of those.
default It was quite telling for me that in our annual survey 
defaultof our members 
defaultthere has been a real shift from where they think they are getting 
defaultthe money from in future. W
defaulte have shifted from the things we have just mentioned into need
defaulting
default to change the way we provide services
default,
default and there is a significant shift happening in thinking around where the money will come from in the future.
defaultQ209 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultIs there 
defaultany
default evidence of that happening on the ground?
defaultMatt Teedefault: 
defaultNo. 
defaultW
defaulthere we are at is people realising that they have reached the end of the road on the easier changes
default and 
defaultthe easier ways of taking out money
default,
default and that they now need to start d
defaultoing the very difficult stuff. 
defaultThat would be where I would put it, I guess. You asked about the next two years and it feels very tough 
defaultfor
default me. There is a degree to which the NHS has always said, 
default“
defaultThis year is just about manageable
default, 
defaultnext year looks very tough and the year after is impossible.
default”
default 
defaultF
defaultor our members in hospitals, particularly in district general hospitals that do not provide community services, 2015
default&#x2011;
default16 looks 
defaultreally
default tough indeed. The effect of the ITF, which I am sure we will come 
defaulton to 
defaulttalk about more, 
defaultis being taken as
default 
defaultbeing 
defaulta very difficult period. We heard that it will require efficiencies, on average, of 6% in hospitals. For the DGHs that will be probably more than 6%
default,
default and it looks very tough indeed.
defaultCouncillor Halldefault: 
defaultFrom the local government point of view, when we presented evidence to this Committee a year ago we had a picture of real pressures and inevitable future service reductions
default.
default 
defaultA
default year on, things are worse than they were. From our point of view, in very challenging times, we have maintained service delivery
default,
default but we really have reached the limit of the efficiencies that we can take in the services that we provide.
defaultQ210 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultDo you want to add to that?
defaultAndrew Websterdefault: I
defaultt is worth dwelling a little on what the membership are saying as well. E
defaultvery year the A
defaultssociation of Directors of Adult Social Services does a survey of the budgetary position as perceived by their members
default,
default and, up to date, they are reporting that
default,
default of the £2.68 billion that has come out of the budget over the last three years
default,
default three quarters has come from efficiency, 7% from increasing charges and the remainder from service changes. 
defaultT
defaulthe vast majority of the savings thus far have been delivered by being more efficient, holding 
defaultdown prices and restructuring the way in which the services are organised without having a substantial impact. But they are overwhelmingly saying that they see in future that they are going to have 
defaultto
default change the model of service quite dramatically in order both to continue to m
defaulteet the equivalent-and-a-bit-
defaultmore saving require
defaultment over the next three years, 
defaultand the ongoing demographic pressure of about 3% per annum
default,
default which they always have to cope with. 
defaultT
defaulthe position is that
default,
default while it has been very tough, it has been weathered, but people
default’
defaults confidence that that can continue is reducing. 
defaultWe are also seeing public anxiety about that increasing. Three years ago the MORI surveys were showing that most people felt that older people
default’
defaults care was not something that was very high on their worry list
default;
default now it is at the top of their worry list because they perceived that the systems that support those people to remain independent are under huge financial pressure and they do not see how that is going to be squared.
defaultCouncillor Halldefault: 
defaultThat
default 3% a year pressure
default translates to £400 million a year needed just to stand still
default while
default, in fact, obviously there have been substantial cuts to the local government budget.
defaultQ211 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault: defaultW
defaulte have
default 
defaulttouched
default already on social care.
default 
defaultW
defaulthat do you think the prospects for social care are now in the current year? The LGA has mentioned increasing levels of legal challenge about service provision. How great do you think is the risk that local authorities will not be able to meet statutory obligations in connection with social care?
defaultAndrew Websterdefault: 
defaultThe first thing to say is that legal challenge to social care entitlement is not new. It has always been in the system
default,
default and one of the reasons why lots of people in the social care sector 
defaultwelcome the current C
defaultare Bill and the process that led to it is that it provides a much clearer statutory footing for entitlement and for distribution of services. That 
defaultbeing 
defaultsaid, without the detail of that new framework being clear, whether it is deliverable or sustainable is a question that in fact nobody can answer
default,
default because we know that the current arrangements are under significant pressure and our interpretation of the legislation is that those pressures are likely to be increased by 
defaultit, 
defaultrather than red
defaultuced. But we have not heard yet—and we could not yet have heard—
defaultthe Government
default’
defaults response to that in terms of the detailed regulation a
defaultnd the funding of those burdens, 
defaultonce they are placed on the system by that new legislative requirement. 
defaultT
defaulthe current system has 
defaultbeen sustainable with a degree—and slightly increasing degree—
defaultof challenge, but how it will work in future once the Act comes into force in 2015
default&#x2011;
default16 we cannot yet predict.
defaultQ212 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultSarah Wollaston 
defaultand
default I were both 
defaulton the 
defaultJoin
defaultt Committee that scrutinised the draft version of the Care Bill, and i
defaultt is fair to say that the people we heard from mi
defaultght have welcomed the framework, 
defaultbut wanted an eligibility criteria of 
default“
defaultmoderate
default”.
default I think we heard that again and again
default,
default and
default,
default if that is not likely
default,
default that reduces support for the framework
default,
default because a framework that alters everybody on to 
default“
defaultsubstantial
default”
default is a different thing.
defaultCouncillor Halldefault: 
defaultWe obviously do not know the detail of that framework yet
default.
default 
defaultI
defaultt is something that we wait to see and we cannot see what challenges there will be until we implement it.
defaultQ213 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default Of 
defaultwhat
default you already know, disregarding any new burdens
default—
defaultbecause if there are new burdens they ought to be funded
default—
defaultfrom what you know of the
default—
default  
defaultChair:default 
defaultThat is a new doctrine.
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultIndeed. I mean from what you already know about funding coming up for the current year and the following year.
defaultCouncillor Halldefault: T
defaulthere are certain areas
default,
default on which Andrew could give more detail
default,
default where we would say we are still arguing that certain burdens are new burdens and need to be funded as such. There is not always recognition that all the things are additional new burdens that need funding because we simply cannot fund them all out of our existing budgets.
defaultQ214 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default W
defaulte 
defaultare
default moving now on to integration as well as reconfiguration
default,
default and I think you have heard some of the questions and the discussion we h
defaultad 
defaultearlier. Could you give us your view o
defaultn how you fit the two together—
defaultthe integration and the 
defaultreconfiguration—
defaultand make sure that that all happens, taking the local communities along with you? 
defaultMatt Teedefault: 
defaultCan I kick off on that? It is a point well made and I thought the 
defaultsession 
defaultearlier was very interesting. It seems to me that we have to be carefu
defaultl that by “reconfiguration” we don’
defaultt just mean closing hospitals. For me
default,
default what we have is a health service 
defaultthat
default is largely structured for dealing with the episodic care needs of the 1960s and 1970s
default,
default and what we need now is a care service 
defaultthat
default extends beyond health
default,
default which looks after 
defaultthe 
defaultfrail elderly with complex needs, people with multiple chronic con
defaultditions and so on. We know that, 
defaultfor a
default lot of those people, 
defaulta hospital is not the best place for them to receive care. 
defaultF
defaultor me
default,
default when we talk about reconfiguration and integration, I start with the needs that we are facing in society and ask, 
default“
defaultHow do we best work with these needs?
default”
default If you are an elderly person with complex needs and you are frail, you have a range of needs that you will not personally probably recognise
default,
default 
defaultas to whether 
defaultit is a health need
default,
default a social care need or indeed a mental health need. For me, that is the starting point for integration. That is where we start saying we need to deal with the care needs of individuals, not with the way the system is structured at the moment and doing it for our convenience. 
defaultWhen I talk about reconfiguration, it is part of a journey that gets us to providing care in different settings in different ways. Part of the consequence of that may be that we do not need all the hospitals we have to do all the things that they currently do
default. W
defaulthen we start the discussion from that point of view
default,
default about people
default’
defaults care needs
default,
default rather than starting it from a position that says
default,
default 
default“W
defaulte have too many A and E departments and we should close some,
default”
default we 
defaultstart 
defaultto have a better conversation about how we begin to do some of that. It is painfully difficult. If it was easy, we 
defaultwould have done it 30 years ago—
defaultand we have not
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe Department of Health, I think laudably, has launched some pioneers in integrated care
default, which is a great thing.
default 
defaultW
defaulte have been trying this for 30 years
default,
default and to have some pioneers now is a great thing
default,
default but it shows how difficult it is. 
defaultOne of our worries would be that people begin to come up with what they think are easy solutions or quick fixes to get us to that point. 
defaultH
defaultaving more integrated commissioning may be part of the answer to that
default, but, if
default having all the money in one place was the answer to integration
default,
default we would have integrated physical and mental health
default 
defaultcare at the moment and we do not. 
defaultI
defaultt may be part of the answer, but there are more things. 
defaultF
defaultor me
default,
default it is really important when 
defaultwe are having the conversation—
defaultwhether it is between health and social care
default,
default health and politics
default, or health and the public—
defaultthat we start off with the care needs of individual people. 
defaultQ215 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultDo you think the current structure helps or hinders that conversation?
defaultMatt Teedefault: 
defaultIf it did not hinder it to the extent it did, we would not be having this conversation
default. It is not just the structures;
default it is almost everything about it. 
defaultW
defaulte have separate providers for mental health
default 
defaultcare, physical care and social care. The economies that fund those care systems are different. About half of social care is provided by the public sector, sometimes through private providers, 
defaultand 
defaultsome of it is person
defaultally funded or insurance 
defaultfunded. Most of the care that takes place in a health
default 
defaultcare setting is publicly funded through an NHS Engl
defaultand commissioning route. All 
defaultthose things have arisen for good historical reasons. Some of those things are no longer fit for the purpose we need them to be.
defaultCouncillor Halldefault: 
defaultFrom our point of view, the profile of integration has grown enormously over the past year
default. T
defaulthe enthusiasm for it across the country can be seen from the fact that there were more than 100 areas bidding to be pioneers and we now have the 14 that are taking place. Of course, in addition to that
default,
default there are also areas such as my own 
defaultin Bath and north
default&#x2011;
defaulteast Somerset—
defaultand I have a couple of examples I could share with you here
default—
defaultwhere there already is a certain amount of integrated work
default,
default which was happening due to individuals in 
defaultthe area building relationships and
default 
defaulttalking to each other over time.
default 
defaultA
defaults Matt has said
default,
default you cannot just put 
defaultin a
default pot of money and 
defaultassume 
defaulteverything will follow. It can be a huge trigger to helping people rewire their services and develop them in a way 
defaultthat
default is geared 
defaulta
defaultround the person
default,
default rather than around the existing provision, but on its own it is not enough. 
defaultHealth and wellbeing boards are established in all localities now
default,
default and I think the opportunities are there to develop their capabilities so that they can really be the leaders in driving this change where you have people from local government, soci
defaultal services, the hospitals and
default from the CCGs. Everybody is talking to each other now in a far greater way than they have done
default,
default and that is happening everywhere to a different degree, obviously, but the relationships are better and in more depth than they have been.
defaultQ216 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultCan we push a little bit on this? We hear that and that is a very clear positive message, if we are going to deliver more joined
default&#x2011;
defaultup
default services. Sir David Nicholson
default said the ITF is a game changer and
default it requires people to work together. But, equally, we still hear health service managers looking at ITF money as 
default“
defaultour 
defaultmoney”.
default It is quite a culture shift for an NHS manager or NHS clinicians to enjoy exchanges with local government throug
defaulth a health and wellbeing board—
defaultI wonder how far down I can ever get these fou
defaultr words in the right order—“forming, 
defaultnorming
default and storming”,
default and I am not sure what the fourth o
defaultne is, but you know what I mean. H
defaultow far down that spectrum have we 
defaultgot
default?
defaultCouncillor Halldefault: 
defaultI know what you mean and I never get them in the right order either. There is a variety of different experience in different areas and we have
default—
defaultand I am going to forget our own words
default now—a series of 
defaultway
defaults
default in which we are supporting health and wellbeing boards to develop these capabilities
default,
default and we are setting out different models of where you will be as you move from being a nascent health and wellbeing board, which is not the word we use, for which apologies, to a mature and exemplar one. Different places are at a different stage with all of this
default,
default and we recognise that there are still some areas where there are tensions. But overall, I think
default—
default 
defaultAndrew Websterdefault: 
defaultCan I add three things to that? 
defaultF
defaultirst
default,
default I think that the creation of clinical commissioning gr
defaultoups has changed that landscape 
defaultconsiderably in that the engagement of general practitioners is now much higher in those conversations. Councillors and general practitioners are the two groups of people who persistently have to confront the people the 
defaultsystem has failed
default,
default and they bring that drive into the system in the way that previous arrangements betwe
defaulten managers of systems did not.
defaultS
defaultecond
defaultly,
default there is a strong clinical recognition, as Matt 
defaultwas saying, 
defaultthat the existing model does not work for the people it most needs to benefit. Therefore, the lead clinicians in the hospitals and in the communities are driving change. 
defaultT
defaulthird
defaultly
default, while it brings huge challenges, the era of austerity means that the option of spending a little more money at the margin is not available to anybody
default.
default 
defaultT
defaultherefore
default,
default if there is going to be some significant ch
defaultange,
default it involves re
default&#x2011;
defaultengineering
default what we already have and what we are already spending
default,
default and that is a different type of conversation and can be a game changer. The evidence that we have is very early evidence from talking to people who are trying to implement the integration transformation fund, and that is not straightforward because all the rules are not yet clear, but people are obviously getting on with it because they want it to succeed. The evidence is that those conversations are happening in a very positive way in many parts of the country and that, given the right framework and rules, people will get to a place where they feel that they can create a genuine integrated plan.
defaultCouncillor Halldefault: 
defaultI have recently heard a story where a CCG is considering spending some money on gritting
default,
default because local authorities have strict criteria about where they g
defaultrit—whether it is a steep hill,
default busy or whatever
default—
defaultand they are going at it 
defaultwith
default one particular approach. The CCG is thinking, 
default“W
defaulthere is it that the frail elderly have slipped in the past and 
defaultthe council 
defaulthas not 
defaultcovered those
default areas
default? S
defaulthall we work together and spend some of this integrated money on gritting?
default”
default It does not cost very much money to do it, but they are pushing at a different angle to try and reduce the number of people
default who end up with a fractured hip.
default 
defaultSo, 
defaultby spending a very tiny amount of money
default,
default you reduce 
defaultthe number of
default people getting injured.
defaultQ217 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultThat
default is horrific. 
defaultI understand the principles behind what you are saying, but the health service needs to do health stuff and local government needs to do that which it 
defaultdoes
default. As with everything else, they are lovely warm words. We all believe in 
default“
defaultintegration
default”—
defaultmotherhood an
defaultd apple pie—
defaultbut
default,
default when it comes to it, 
defaultwhat would the reaction of the 
defaultgeneral public 
defaultbe if you were to 
defaultsay
default to them
default, 
default“
defaultWe are going to cut the budgets of local authoriti
defaultes to the bone, so they cannot do x, y and z
default, but 
defaultthat 
defaultis okay because while we are taking 
defaultmoney out of the health service, 
defaultwe w
defaultill use that to grit your roads”?
default A public health professional who sat in the seat you are sitting in when we were doing another inquiry 
defaultresponded
default, 
default“
defaultSome pe
defaultople may think that filling pot
defaultholes is a public health duty.
default”
default 
defaultW
defaulthy do
defaultn’t
default 
defaultwe 
defaultjust dump all the money in a pot and everybody grab a bit? I am quite sure that people who are sitting listening 
defaultwould not be happy with 
defaultthe idea that they cannot get an operat
defaultion or the drugs that they need, but mean
defaultwhile
default 
defaulthealth service money that they are paying via their taxes into the health serv
defaultice is being used to grit roads.
defaultChair:default Rosie, 
defaultthat is a fair challenge. Could Matt Tee have a say on this question and then we will move to Barbara?
defaultMatt Teedefault: 
defaultI think, in terms of the integration, 
defaultand 
defaultparticularly the conversation between local government and health, we have a paradox here. The paradox for me is that the conversation is quite difficult because we
default are both financially pressured.
default I am not wishing to have a competition about who is most financially pressured
default,
default but we 
defaultare very financially pressured, 
defaultwhich makes the conversation difficult. 
defaultI
defaultn many ways
default,
default if we were not financially pressured
default,
default we would not be having the conversation and it is making best use of a crisis, I guess. 
defaultFor me
default,
default the nature of that conversation has changed materially over the last five years. We now see a vested interest in speaking to each other and in co
default&#x2011;
defaultoperating across boundaries. 
defaultF
defaultive years ago
default,
default if you had 
defaulthad a hospital chief exec
default sitting here
default,
default they would be saying
default,
default 
default“
defaultMy only interest in l
defaultocal authorities is why they don’
defaultt take the people I want to discharge,
default”
default and it is now a much better conversation a
defaultbout a system. It is not there; there is still a way to go.
defaultY
defaultou talked about ownership and about the ITF. 
defaultW
defaulte see difficulties in that relationship where people have a perception of ownership, either of money or services, and do not have a focus on the citizen and the service they require
default,
default and how we best join it up for their needs. 
defaultF
defaultor me
default,
default some of the best health and wellbeing boards are where, although they may sit within the council, they are not perceived as being owned by the local authority
default but 
defaultare perceived as being owned by the system.
defaultQ218 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default Hang on. You
default are still not addressing the real question. We are talking about all these nice warm words, but the reality is 
defaultabout 
defaulthow you think that taxpayers in general will feel when they see their local doctors paying to have their roads gritted? How do y
defaultou think that plays when I can’
defaultt get my drugs 
defaultand I can’t
default get my operation?
defaultAndrew Percy:default 
defaultYou would 
defaulthave 
defaulteven less chance of getting your drugs or operation if five old people 
defaultwho h
defaultad 
defaultbroken 
defaulttheir 
defaulthips 
defaultwere 
defaultfilling up the beds.
defaultRosie Cooper:default Hang on. 
defaultBut the priority is
default—
default  
defaultChair:default 
defaultT
defaulthis is not an exchange between m
defaultembers of the Committee.
defaultAndrew Percy:default 
defaultBut it is about 
defaultreducing admissions to hospital, 
defaultand they can do whatever things they think are most effective locally.
defaultMatt Teedefault: 
defaultWhen we talk about pressure on the system, 
defaultit 
defaulthappens in two ways and that is why it shows up in A and E departments. We have too many people coming in and we cannot discharge them fast enough. One of the ways we need to work to relieve pressure on the system is to have fewer people coming in. The gritting may be an extreme example, but that the health service has a responsibility for prevention seems to me to be absolutely true.
defaultQ219 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultI 
defaultabsolutely
default do agree with the principle, but the problem I have is 
defaultthat 
defaultwe have had Councillor Hall and a public health professional both use examples where saving the health servic
defaulte money actually means that a 
defaultjob that would have been done by 
defaulta 
defaultlocal authority is going to continue to be done
default,
default 
defaultbut 
defaultusing health service money. That is the problem.
defaultAndrew Websterdefault: 
defaultThere is an element in which that is the essence of the integration transformation fund
default,
default because the purpose of it is to protect social care and community services in a way that reduces pressure on hospitals. Clearly
default,
default that is not an easy thing to do and it involves the kinds of conversations that Matt Tee has been referring to
default,
default but there are two underlying principles that are very important to local government in it. One is that, by working together, the health service and local government will get a better deal.
defaultQ220 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultSo combine 
defaultthe
default budgets now.
defaultAndrew Websterdefault: 
defaultYes, I was coming on to that. That should lead, over time, to a system in which the budgets are combined and more locally accountable
default,
default because that way local people would be able to hold all their local services to account for the deliver
defaulty
default of a better service.
defaultQ221 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultJust to close 
defaultthat
default off, there is a danger 
defaultwith that
default 
defaultbecause, 
defaultif you start on gritting in winter
default, you have to start on potholes and
default pavements
default,
default and then there is swimming. My local authority had free school swimming. Are you going to bring that ba
defaultck? Are you going to fund the school sport p
defaultartnership
defaults
default? Some of these things, in terms of obesity and those aspects of health, may be things you should do
default,
default but you cannot make this health money totally elastic. 
defaultThe question I wanted to get into was how effective the health and wellbeing boards are proving to be in engaging those across health and social care in planning local services. You talked about conversations and good relationships, but we need more than that. I do not know if you were here earlier when our Nuffield Trust panel member talked about the need for really robust plans, 
defaultbut, 
defaultif we are talking about £1.9 billion extra funding coming across from the NH
defaultS out of £3.8 billion funding—
defaultthe other £1.9 billion is 
defaultthe 
defaultalready existing amounts
default—
defaultthat needs more than good relationships and talking to each other, does 
defaultit 
defaultnot? At what point do you see you getting into much more robust planning and much more concrete ways of moving forward
default?
default 
defaultR
defaultelationships and talking is nice
default,
default but it is not really shifting anything, is it?
defaultCouncillor Halldefault: 
defaultAbsolutely. You need to look at the whole system. How do you start with prevention and stopping somebody coming into hospital
default? I
defaultf somebody comes into hospital
default,
default why do they spend longer than they need to 
defaultbe 
defaultin hospital
default?
default 
defaultT
defaulthen
default,
default how do you get people out 
defaultof hospital? How do you do 
defaultre
defaultablement
default services to get people out
default?
default 
defaultY
defaultou need to look at it throughout the whole process.
defaultQ222 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultStop at that point, 
defaultbecause
default 
defaultyou were talking about back-
defaultfilling council funding in terms of gritting, 
defaultso 
defaultdo you then just use all the money that is meant to be us
defaulted on integration in back-filling? S
defaultay, for instance, the local authority is moving its eligibility on to 
default“
defaultsubstantial
default”
default or to 
default“
defaultcritical
default”
default, do you then say, 
default“
defaultOkay, the way to keep people out of hospital is to go back to the service 
defaultwe had three years ago, so let’
defaults just spend it all on care packages
default,”
default and not move
default 
defaulton with true integration at all? 
defaultThe worry is 
defaultthat the money will just get eaten up like other transfers have been 
defaultby 
defaultdoing things that the local authority was able to fund a couple of years a
defaultgo and is not able to fund now.
default That is the logic of what you said, but that is not integration. Integration is not just looking at how we can keep people out of hospital, is it?
defaultCouncillor Halldefault: No.
default 
defaultWe
default 
defaultneed to 
defaultlook at the whole system of where people are coming into the different services from and what happens to an individual person
default. 
defaultI do not know if you have seen the excellent King
default’
defaults Fund animation about jo
defaultining the services up for a man
default call
defaulted
default Sam
default, but
default 
defaultin it 
defaultthey 
defaultsay that
default 
defaultthe services seem
default 
defaultto come from all over the place for that individual
default 
defaultand 
defaultthat he has
default to tell 
defaulthis
default story again and again to get the services that
default he
default want
defaults
default. 
defaultW
defaulthat we are trying to achieve by this approach
default—
defaultby pooling the funds 
defaultand 
defaultdoing things together
default—is to end up with having 
defaultfe
defaultwer different people and 
defaultser
defaultvices, and more shared information. 
defaultAndrew can maybe talk in some detail about the i
defaultmportance of transferring data and sharing information
default based on national health numbers and stuff like that
default,
default which, at the moment, or in many places, have been blocks to that information. Somebody could be discharged from hospital, for example, and the care record does not follow them for a week or two or longer
default,
default or maybe not at all. We are trying to make sure that this information stays with the person. Perhaps you could exp
defaultlain how that could work.
defaultAndrew Websterdefault: 
defaultTo answer directly the question about health and wellbeing boards, they are the leaders of this system, are they not? They are not themselves going to do the things that Councillor Hall was just describing to you. They are there to require that 
defaultthey are
default done and to set the framework in which 
defaultthey
default can be
default done
default.
defaultQ223 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultBut at the moment they are the only point where all these bodies come together.
defaultAndrew Websterdefault: 
defaultIn
defaultdeed. T
defaulthe way in which they hold each other to account in that process is very important and I think is reinforced by the introduction of the integration transformation fund
default.
default 
defaultA
defaults Councillor Hall was saying, some of the requirements that introduces aro
defaultund jointly signing off a plan—
defaultprotecting the social care service, sharing information, adopting common procedures,
default understanding the whole system
default 
defaultand 
defaultworking out how they will manage risk if
default things do not go as they plan—
defaultare a step above where health and wellbeing boards have been working in their early months and 
defaultare a challenge to them.  W
defaulte are putting a considerable amount of support into enabling them to do 
defaultthat 
defaultand other parts of the system are also supporting their contributors 
defaultto 
defaultdo
default it
default. 
defaultW
defaulte cannot sit here today and say, 
default“
defaultYes, there is a health and wellbeing board that has done it and here is the model,
default”
default but we can identify the places that are doing well and 
defaultthose
default that are facing challenges
default,
default and support them to learn from one another. The solutions and the leadership will be different in different places. A single national prescription would be wrong for most of the 153 localities.
defaultMatt Teedefault: 
defaultWe are quite worried about this. We support the principle of the integration transformation fund. Our worry is 
defaultthat 
defaultthe time when it is going t
defaulto happen is coming very quickly
default and we do not see enough planning taking place in enough places for us to be sure of the effect that this money will have. If I can give you an example, I was in a quite challenged hospital in the home counties yesterday speaking to the d
defaultirector of operations there.  
defaultI said, 
default“
defaultSo talk to me about the integration transformation fund,
default”
default and he said, 
default“
defaultI am relatively optimistic. They have at least started talking to us about it.
default”
default It feels to me 
defaultas if
default there is the potential for a good conversation and for some good deals to be done there
default,
default but there is a real urgency about involving the right people in those conversations 
defaultso 
defaultthat health plays the part it should play in integrated treatment
default,
default but also so that health understands what it can legitimately expect in terms of reduction in demand on the health system.
defaultQ224 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultBut if you have an 
defaultexample
default of a challenged trust, how difficult 
defaultis it 
defaultfor them to prioritise doing more than just having nice conversations
default,
default when they have other challenges and a little bit of time lapse
default because there is a tendency to think—
default 
defaultMatt Teedefault: 
defaultPart of the reason I think the ITF incentivises some go
defaultod behaviours is that that
default trust knows that it is not getting that chunk of money when the ITF comes along
default,
default so it has a 
defaultreal 
defaultvested interest in being involved in the conversation about what that money is spent on. That, I think, is good in the system
default,
default and trusts and providers broadly are giving time in order to be part of those
default conversations. I feel, 
defaultas Andrew said earlier
default,
default 
defaultthat they
default think it is not yet clear what the rules are
default,
default so it is not clear how the deal happens. 
defaultW
defaulte need a bit more urgency in that.
defaultQ225 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultWhat 
defaulthappens
default if
default 
defaultthe trusts are not invited to that conversation
default? T
defaulthere are three or four trusts in their area and one or two are 
defaultexcluded from that conversation.
defaultMatt Teedefault: I
defaultt would go completely against the spirit of the ITF.
defaultAndrew Websterdefault: 
defaultThe expectation is that they are.
defaultQ226 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultFrom a local 
defaultgovernment
default perspective, what Matt Tee has just said chimes a little bit with what you said a moment ago
default,
default because one of the questions in my mind, listening to you talk, was, 
default“
defaultCoul
defaultd you point us in the direction”—
defaultacc
defaultepting that there is a variety—“
defaultof a health and wellbeing board where you feel this is a process that is working
default and 
defaultthat is delivering change on the ground
default?” Y
defaultou have said, 
default“
defaultWell, not yet, but I can point you to one or two where t
defaulthere are some encouraging signs,”
default and in one part of the country an encouraging sign is that they have exchanged telephone numbers.
defaultCouncillor Halldefault: 
defaultThere certain
defaultly
default are some localities where working together is already happening and is happening well. We have an example of some interesting work in 
defaultGreenwich
default through their community health services
default, the 
defaultOxleas
default NHS Foundation T
defaultrust and the council
default’
defaults adult social care services. There
default,
default the users and the staff access the integrated care service via a single point of contact, which is obviously much easier for the individual person concerned, and this incorporates referral pathways
default,
default which can immediately address an individual
default’
defaults needs
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe integrated health and social care teams provide the whole
default&#x2011;
defaultsystem
default re
defaultsponse to the intermediate care and
default the hospital discharge
default,
default and the social care teams provide rehabilitation. 
defaultI
defaultt is yielding a number of positive results. We have had a reduction there in A and E admissions, 
defaultin hospital admissions and
default care home admissions, which obviously 
defaultis
default very important, and fewer people entering full social care.
defaultQ227 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultThose things, where you finished up, are the tests. That is the answer to Barbara
default’
defaults point, is it not? There is no value in spending this money in hospitals if they do not need to be there. That is the whole point. The point is to remodel the system in order to reduce demand for hospital space. If you can demonstrate health economies where closer working is delivering reduced hospital admissions and quicker hospital discharges, 
defaultand 
defaulttherefore 
defaultreducing 
defaultthe demand for bed space, we are getting somewhere
default,
default but it does not feel as though that is happening anywhere very quickly at the moment.
defaultCouncillor Halldefault: 
defaultWe have a number of value case
defaults
default 
defaultthat
default we could share with the Committee of places that 
defaultalready 
defaulthave this.
defaultQ228 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultIt would be useful to see 
defaultevidence
default on the ground of real declining admissions or real accelerated discharges.
defaultCouncillor Halldefault: 
defaultWhat we really want is 
defaultto 
defaultkeep people out of hospital who do not need to be there
default,
default because we all know that
default,
default if a frail elderly 
defaultperson 
defaultgoes to hospital, is admitted and stays there for longer, their outlook is less good. 
defaultW
defaulte need to do what we can to reduce the number of people going to hospital. I will ask the team to send you these value cases that we have drawn up. I think we have eight from different areas around the country where we can show that this is really effective.  
defaultChair:default It would be good to see a time
defaultline showing trends in an inner local economy and also comparing that economy with other equivalent economies elsewhere in the country. Okay, thank you. 
defaultQ229 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew Percy:default 
defaultStaying
default on integration—
defaultthis is probably a question more for Matt
default—
defaultdo you think we will need to see mergers of hospital trusts or CCGs
default? E
defaultveryone talks about integration
default,
default and in my area I am very lucky that the local council 
defaulthas 
defaultmaintained social care at moderate intervention levels
default and
default 
defaultis 
defaultbuilding a new intermediate care centre with 30 beds, which 
defaultis brilliant, 
defaultwith 
defaulta lot of money going in because 
defaultit has 
defaultmade some tough political choices
default. B
defaultut the rest of our services have been reconfi
defaultgured. We have one health trust and
default one hospital trust,
default so there is the hospital trust and
default two different CCGs
default,
default bu
defaultt one of the CCGs is really two 
defaultthirds in another hospital trust, so 
defaultit has 
defaultto decide w
defaulthat they want from one hospital, and t
defaulthe other CCG has to decide what it wants from the other two hospitals. 
defaultThey are all going through their own se
defaultparate processes a
defaultt the very moment when everybody is talking about integration
default,
default but one is doing 
defaultits “
defaulthealthy lives, healthy future
default”
default thing and the trust is reconfiguring services already within it
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthen we
default have one council, fortunately, 
defaultdoing very 
defaultgood things for my constituents, 
defaultbecause we
default are seeing new services coming, but 
defaultit is still all a bit of a mess. 
defaultSo long as we have different bodies, d
defaulto you think we are going to see mergers of either CCGs or acute trusts?
defaultMatt Teedefault: 
defaultI do, but perhaps not for the reasons that you may think
default, and we can see it already.
default One of the
default 
defaultresponses that providers are making to the financial challenges is to look to merge places because they can reduce some of the costs that are involved in providing treatment. 
defaultIt is quite likely that 
defaultwe will begin to see more mergers driven by a need to be more efficient
default.
default In terms of CCGs, it is a
defaultn
default interesting question and I do not think we know the an
defaultswer yet. Certainly the variance
default in the populations that CCGs cover 
defaultis
default quite large
default,
default and I think we do not know yet whether that is okay or whether we need to be more consistent about the size of population that CCGs cover. 
defaultThe one point I would make is that I do not think that merging organisations 
defaultnecessarily 
defaultgives you better joined
default&#x2011;
defaultup
default services. I can think of hospitals that I know that have merged where they are still essentially providing different services on different sites
default,
default and other places where a collaboration between hospitals that has not required an organisational merger has led to much more joined
default&#x2011;
defaultup
default working, the ability to do different sorts of surgery on different sites and those sorts of 
defaultthings. It is part of an answer, 
defaultbut it is not 
default“
defaultthe
default”
default answer.
defaultQ230 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultI want to 
defaultask
default about the way in which the local government world experiences trusts that are getting themselves into financial difficulty. We asked the previous panel about 
defaultthe 
defaultgrowing numbers of trusts that are running deficits. Does that lead to a more focused, urgent and fundamental conversation with local authority partners
default,
default or does it lead 
defaultto 
defaultdrawing up the blinds and
default saying
default, 
default“
defaultWe have got a crisis and
default we are too busy to talk to you”?
defaultCouncillor Halldefault: 
defaultI do not have 
defaulta
default specific knowledge of that.
defaultAndrew Websterdefault: 
defaultWe have not asked that question directly of our members
default, s
defaulto
default I hope 
defaultyou will bear with an impressionistic answer from me
default.  H
defaultaving talked to some of them 
defaultand 
defaultbeen to areas where those pressures exist, I would say 
defaultthat 
defaultit depends entirely on how the relationships were before the problem emerged. 
defaultFor p
defaultlaces that have known that they have to deal with those sorts of issues and have worked together on them, the exacerbation of that pressure leads to them drawing together and seeking more radical decisions. In places where that issue has itself been a divider, it makes it worse. We have 
defaultseen both 
defaultexamples around the country. One of the helpful things in the current guidance on the fund is that the activity has to be aggregated at the level of a health and wellbeing board so 
defaultthat 
defaultthe council can see the overall picture
default,
default and it has to say what the impact of the plan is on the acute sector
default. So w
defaulthether it is resolving those pressures or not will be evident to the counci
defaultl and to all the other partners,
default and it has to go through a process of, 
default“
defaultIs it a credible plan
default?”
default through a peer review by other people in local government and by the NHS.
defaultQ231 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultJust to 
defaultinterrupt
default you for a second, that throws local government in
default at the deep end, does it not? Suppose y
defaultou have a hospital in deficit
default.  The 
defaultmajority of local government has not, until very recently, shown anything but a relatively superficial interest in the local health economy, 
defaultbut 
defaultif 
defaulta local authority 
defaultis dealing with a trust 
defaultthat has 
defaultdeveloping financial pressures, how well equipped 
defaultis it 
defaultto pl
defaultay the role that it should play?
default The thought behind the question i
defaults not that this is undesirable—I think it is very desirable—
defaultbut I wonder how well equipped the local authority is t
defaulto play its part in that process.
defaultCouncillor Halldefault: B
defaultecause we have not asked that specific question of our members
default, we cannot answer
default.
defaultMatt Teedefault: 
defaultWe should not be surprised if the answer is
default,
default 
default“
defaultNot very well.
default”
default This is very new stuff we are talking about. If we were to go back three or four years, most trusts and local authorities would not have thought that a hospital trust running a deficit was anything to do with the local authority. We are at least now in a place where we would recognise that
default,
default if you have financial difficulties in one part of the care system
default,
default it is going to impact on the other parts of the care system
default, 
defaultand that is a much mo
defaultre mature conversation, I think
default almost everywhere
default,
default than we used to have. 
defaultW
defaulte 
defaultwere 
defaulttalking earlier about pooled budgets and so on
default, but we will, I am sure, get to a point where 
defaultwe have things like public sector risk pools across localities and so on
default,
default where that will be 
defaulta 
defaultr
defaultoutine part
default of what we do and we will not consider financial pressure in one part of the system to be owned by that part of the system
default. B
defaultut we are still on that journey to maturity. 
defaultI
defaultt will be better than it would have been, but I do not think we are anywhere near there. 
defaultQ232 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultI am 
defaultalmost
default a mutant in the sense
default that I was chair of a hospital, 
defaultbut a councillor for all those years
default,
default and the reality is that 
defaultcouncillors 
defaultare interested in the broad
default&#x2011;
defaultbrush political aspects of health, but would not have a clue about the real detail ever. I put that very question to Sir David Nicholson and talked about the maturity of health and wellbeing boards. They are great at talking and there is dynamic analysis and all that
default—
defaultwhatever you want to do
default—
defaultbut the reality is that you do not have power to make it happen and it has to be by consensus. 
defaultMy original question
default—I am sorry Andrew is not 
defaulthere now
default—was almost based o
defaultn that in that I want to see some real change. The difficulty councillors are going to have is when 
defaultthe hospital is in real trouble. I
defaultt is not just about 
defaultthe social care element of it and, therefore,
default not just the transformational bit, but
default,
default when the hospital is perhaps going to merge or close
default,
default or departments c
defaultlose, with local politicians
default being very close to the fact that their people do not want this to happen, it will be a very difficult conversation. I am not sure you have the strength or the detailed knowledge to handle the actual mechanics of the hospital end of it. Nor do I want to see, which is the point I was really trying to make before, the transformational fund or anything like it being used, for example, to empty bins
default, because i
defaultt is a public health hazard if the local authority cannot afford to do it. 
defaultI
default put 
defaultit 
defaultto Sir David Nicholson that we are on a cliff edge and he agreed
default.
default 
defaultI
defaultt really is serious because that cliff edge is about forcing hospitals to fall over, change, merge or divest themselves of authority. Right now you are in a comfortable position in that the health and wellbeing board is not responsible. When that mix hits together and starts almost 
defaultto 
defaultsolidify, I do not think that the health and wellbeing boards have the strength or the maturity to deliver 
defaulton 
defaultthat. That is, I suppose, the co
defaultmment that the Chair was making, 
defaultand I fear at that point who gets control of it. Does it just collapse? 
defaultMatt Teedefault: 
defaultI do 
defaultnot feel in a comfortable place and 
defaultI do not think my memb
defaulters feel in a comfortable place.  
defaultI doubt whether yo
defaulturs do, 
defaulteither.
defaultCouncillor Halldefault: 
defaultNo.
defaultMatt Teedefault: 
defaultThis feels like we are in a storm and the storm is only getting worse. I re
defaultcognise the risk of what you say—
defaultthat we end up in a place where services fail and we are looking for who is going to pick
default it up and make something of it. But 
defaultwe as health and with local government have a responsibility 
defaultto see 
defaultthat that does not happen. One of the conversations that I think we have not 
defaulthad
default well enough, as health, 
defaultis working with local authorities and
default political colleagues to make the case for change and to seek local political support. 
defaultIn a way, i
defaultt is much more diff
defaulticult for Members of Parliament—and candidates for Parliament—
defaultto support change
default,
default because they are not dealing with some of those questions in terms of public services day in
default,
default day out. My experience is that local councillors can quite often see
default—
defaultparticularly because they have had to make very difficult decisions about their own public services
default—
defaultthe ne
defaultcessity and the case for change, 
defaultand will support that if it is put in the right way.
defaultQ233 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default They are ve
defaultr
defaulty brave 
defaultcouncillors
default.
defaultT
defaulthe transformational fund has £3.8 billion. I was looking at some figures a fortnight ago 
defaultthat
default showed that 
defaultthe 
defaultGovernment, if you like, 
defaultare
default looking to that to grow to around £59 billion
default,
default and, of that, they believe that there can be an efficiency gain of £20 billion. On those figures, it looks like that £20 billion could go to the Treasury. If that is actually the case, what do you have to say about that?
defaultMatt Teedefault: 
defaultI am not familiar with those figures.
defaultQ234 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultI will 
defaulthappily
default make them available to you because I am going to write
default to David Nicholson about them.
defaultMatt Teedefault: 
defaultIt would be very good to see those figures. If you were to say to me, 
default“
defaultCan we take £20 billion out of integrated care betwe
defaulten health and local authorities?”,
default that feels like a very big chunk of money to be taking out of those services.
defaultQ235 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultThey will grow it from £3.8 billion, so 
defaultit is 
defaultjoint budgets, not just out of one side. They will grow that to get £59
default 
defaultbillion
default,
default and, of that, if you integrate 
defaultdivisions
default they could liberate
default— 
defaultAndrew Websterdefault: 
defaultThere would still be a 40% deficiency.
defaultQ236 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default W
defaulthat would you think about it going to the Treasury?
defaultMatt Teedefault: 
defaultI would go to John Appleby
default’
defaults point, which is
default,
default 
default“
defaultEfficiency for what? What does the money get used for?
default”
defaultQ237 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultIf it goes back into the Treasury
default,
default you will not be using it for anything.
defaultCouncillor Halldefault: 
defaultWe have not seen those figures either. If that is the case
default—
defaultif you are talking about taking another 40% of the money out
default—
defaultthat does not sound to me sustainable
default,
default but we would very much like to see those. 
defaultAndrew Websterdefault: 
defaultIt is probably worth making a couple of other points. Our estimation of the forward spending plans is that close to that number is going to come out whether there is an integration fund or not, so that issue is confronting local government anyway
default.
default I would very strongly echo Matt
default’
defaults point
default: 
defaultI think
default that 
defaultbringing together the best clinical skill of the NHS with the local political skill of councils would be a significant advantage in developing and communicating these proposals.
defaultChair:default 
defaultThere is a final question on resource allocation.
defaultQ238 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultWe are 
defaultover
default time as we were last time. You were all here when I raised a 
defaultquestion
default earlier about resource allocation, 
defaultso I do not need to repeat that,
default but 
defaultI would 
defaultask you
default,
default in relation to both the 
defaultc
defaultonfederation and local government
default’
defaults views on it, whether you are satisfied that the allocation is fairly based on need. 
defaultP
defaultrobably, more importantly, have there been any conversations
default about,
default and do you think there is a prospect
default of
default, bearing in mind your earlier discussion about integration, the harmonisation of the allocation of funds
default across health and social care—
defaultin other words a greater harmonisation, perhaps even coming in one pot rather than two?
defaultAndrew Websterdefault: In our 
defaultRewiring Public Services
default document
default,
default we made it very clear that we do think there should be a single allocation to each locality for public services and that that should be based on a simpler formula
default,
default which is co
default&#x2011;
defaultdesigned
default by local and central Government rather than imposed by the Treasury, as currently exists. 
defaultO
defaultur aspir
defaultation would be for a single pot
default for 
defaultnot only 
defaulthealth and social care
default, but 
defaultpublic services across the locality. 
defaultIn the very short term, the system could do with some certainty about the basis on which the allocations are going to be made
default, because at the moment
default there is uncertainty about the CCG allocation formula. There is uncertainty about the formula that will be applied to the integration transformation fund
default,
default and there are lots of local government finance directors scratching their heads wondering what number to put in next year
default’
defaults budget. The sooner they know that, the more likely we are to make the right decisions and deliver the best with that money. So, in the long run, harmonisation would be good. In the short run, certainty would be helpful.
defaultMatt Teedefault: 
defaultI would make three points. I agree with 
defaultthe certainty point absolutely; that is 
defaulta very strong message from us. 
defaultThe second point is that
default,
default while there are a number of localities
default I know
default that think that the allocation at the moment is very unfair, I suspect, whatever you do to the allocation, you will not reduce 
defaultthe
default number
default of those who feel that it is very unfair.
default John Appleby
default’
defaults point about the complexity of the system plays through to that. 
defaultMy third thought echoes something I said earlier, 
defaultwhich is that,
default yes, we would share a general aspiration that there was more joint budgeting between different services, but, to repeat, just by having joint budgets
default, it
default does not give you joint services
default and
default 
defaultdoes 
defaultn
defaultot give you integrated services.
default 
defaultT
defaulthat is, I think, the difficult bit. You can create joint budgets by saying you a
defaultre going to have joint budgets, but 
defaultthe working on the ground that makes it feel different for the person who is elderly with com
defaultplex needs is more complicated and 
defaultdifficult to do than just putting the money together.
defaultCouncillor Halldefault: 
defaultA joint budget is the lever to transforming services.
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultThat is fine.   
defaultChair:default 
defaultThank you very much. Thank you for bearing with us
default in
default 
defaultthe 
defaultgathering gloom on a November evening. We shall reflect on what you said and have a report, I guess, early in the new year.
