[normal]Q17 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Chairman[bold]:[bold] Welcome to the second meeting of the Economic Affairs Committee’s Finance Bill Sub
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]Committee 2014.  As is now clear, we are looking into selected aspects of the draft Finance Bill published in December.  We have selected the taxation of partnerships, which is one of the more controversial aspects of the Bill and we intend to publish our report in early March, so that it is available for scrutiny in the House of Commons.  Lists of Members’ interest
[normal]s declared as relevant to this i
[normal]nquiry are in the room and available to the public and to witnesses.  
[normal]Professor
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Freedman, Mr
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Gammie and Mr
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Sanger, welcome.  It is good to see you again, dealing with the Finance Bill as we have done in the past.  Thank you for coming.  Would anyone like to make
[normal] an opening statement, 
[normal]or 
[normal]shal
[normal]l we go straight to questions?
[normal]Chris Sanger: [bold]No
[normal],
[normal] thank you.
[normal]  
[normal]Malcolm Gammie:[bold] Perhaps I could just say—and this may go for Mr
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Sanger as well—that, as noted, we are members of the Tax Professionals Forum.  Obviously I and
[normal],
[normal] I think, Mr
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Sanger appear here in our personal capacity
[normal]. We are not speaking for the f
[normal]orum.
[normal]The Chairman[bold]:[bold] Understood.
[normal]Professor Freedman:[bold] Perhaps I should also say that I am here in my personal capacity, and although I am called the Pinsent Masons 
[normal]p
[normal]rofessor, I am not employed by Pinsent
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Masons; they simply give a donation to 
[normal]Oxford
[normal] 
[normal]University
[normal].  
[normal]Q18 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Chairman[bold]:[bold] Yes, I think we understand that very well.  All the questions are open to you all but, as before, if you simply agree with whoever has answered the question first, it is not necessary for you to feel that you have to repeat the same points.  If you are particularly strongly in favour, if you nod, I will make sure that 
[normal]is recorded in the transcript.
[normal]Can we begin with a very general question?  As is very clear from all the evidence that we have and our first session, there is a very wide range of businesses and firms structured as partnerships, with a significant impact on the economy and certainly with very different sizes.  Is it right that the whole range of partnerships should be taxed in essentially the same way?  
[normal]Malcolm Gammie:[bold] One starting point is to say that a partnership is merely one of the various forms in which business and other activities can be carried on and, ideally, you would want to tax all those different structures in a way that ensured that people who were earning similar amounts in respect of their activities were paying similar amounts of tax.  Of course, we very rarely achieve that particular objective as part of our tax system, but unless there is some objective difference between the way in which partnerships are structured and are being used in a particular way, you would probably try to tax them similarly.  
[normal]Chris Sanger:[bold] If I can add to that, the same question could be applied to companies more generally.  We have a single system of taxation that applies to all companies, and if you take the nuance of the partnership, given 
[normal]that 
[normal]the partnership is
[normal] 
[normal]tax transparent, if you were to take a different approach to the members or partners of that partnership, you 
[normal]would 
[normal]do it at the partner or member level rather than at the partnership level itself.
[normal]Professor Freedman:[bold] I would agree on the neutrality point.  I would just add that every time a new kind of tax creature is created you create new opportunities, so the idea of having special rules for certain partnerships may seem superficially attractive but will create problems because there will then be arbitr
[normal]age and avoidance around that.
[normal]Q19 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Chairman[bold]:[bold] I know, Professor Freedman, 
[normal]that 
[normal]you have a special interest in small and medium
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]sized businesses and, again from the evidence we have been hearing so far, there is a particularly wide range.  On one side, there are the very large professional partnerships and, on the other side, the husband and wife or two
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]person small business.  Do you think that taxing the very small partnerships in the same way is the best approach? 
[normal]Professor Freedman:[bold] Ideally, some of the largest partnerships should be corporations and should be taxed as corporations.  However, I do agree with Malcolm
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Gammie that the ideal should be to reduce the differences as much as possible between the different types of taxation, rather than creating new differences.  One can say that the husband
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]and
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]wife business looks very, very different from the 500
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]partnership, but there is a spectrum and you have to decide where you draw the line across that spectrum
[normal],
[normal] and that is much more difficult to do.  It is very easy when you look at the paradigm cases at each end, but it is much, much more difficult to find a threshold
[normal]. And 
[normal]then you have to decide why you want to tax them differently.  
[normal]Y
[normal]ou might want to tax them differently 
[normal]because 
[normal]the husband
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]and
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]wife partnership 
[normal]are 
[normal]essentially earning income from their input and very rarely have any capital, whereas the large 500
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]partner business probably has capital invested and some of the return is a return on capital.  
[normal]The Chairman[bold]:[bold] But you are not suggesting, despite that comment, that there should be any general change in the way of partnership taxation.
[normal]Professor Freedman:[bold] I am not suggesting that.  We have to find a way of taxing across the board so that we recognise 
[normal]the 
[normal]different types of income that are coming out of those businesses.  There are suggestions on the table in the
[normal] 
[normal]Mirrlees
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]review
[normal], in the chapter that I wrote and then the subsequent volume that Malcolm edited, on how one could do that.  
[normal]Q20 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Chairman[bold]:[bold] One of the points that have been coming up is the taxation of partnership profits retained for expansion of the business.  Ought there to be some way of retaining profits at a lower tax rate?
[normal]Malcolm Gammie:[bold] Of course, within a corporate entity retained profits are only taxed at the corporate rate.  The distinction with a transparent partnership would ordinarily be that the profits are taxed at the personal tax rate and then retained in the business, so it has frequently been argued that retained profits should benefit from a lower tax rate in a similar way that corporate retained profits can do so.  Again, it is a distinction between the way in which we tax two different entities that can, in fact, look very similar in terms of the activities and organisation and funding that is going on through those different organisations.  Insofar as you want to be consistent in the way in which you want to treat them, you might say there are good arguments for taxing retained profits at a lower rate.  On the other hand, you might argue that in relation to many small companies that are not much different from partnerships, perhaps retained profits should be taxed at the personal rate.  
[normal]The Chairman[bold]:[bold] You posed the question
[normal]. D
[normal]o you have a view about the answer?
[normal]Malcolm Gammie:[bold] At the moment, we are embedded in the system of taxing corporate profits at the corporate rate even when they are retained.  We abolished 
[normal]the 
[normal]apportionment of corporate profits back in about 1988 or1989 and, of course, as the differential between personal and corporate tax rates has increased, it puts more pressure on the distinction that exists.  So long as we are going to stay in that way, there would be arguments—maybe good arguments—for taxing retained profits in partnerships in the same way.  However, whereas a corporate entity gives you effectively the structure or the shell with which you can distinguish retained and distributed profits, that is far more difficult in a partnership context where withdrawals from the partnership and the ability of partners to enjoy the benefit of profits, which appear to be retained but in fact are being enjoyed for personal use, may be far more difficult to discern.
[normal]The Chairman[bold]:[bold] I think you were nodding.
[normal]Professor Freedman:[bold] I agree.  There are two very separate legal structures
[normal]. T
[normal]hey have different legal rights
[normal],
[normal] duties and organisation, and people have to choose between them.  There are benefits of having a partnership and there are benefits of having a corporation.  At the moment, that is the way it is, and you cannot let people pick and mix the bits that they want, because that again will just give rise to avoidance opportunities.  It would be very difficult to control that system of taxing retained earnings at a lower rate within a partnership
[normal]. W
[normal]hat do you mean by “retention”
[normal],
[normal] and so on?  It is much harder to define than with a corporation.
[normal]Chris Sanger:[bold] If I could add to that, there is an essence of difference between partnership, which 
[normal]is 
[normal]generally particularly in the professional partnerships, which generate the capital from the members, where you have ownership and management of the partnership in one compared to a corporate, where you clearly have the distinction between the management of the company and the shareholders.  If you were looking at making a change, you would look across the whole range of other treatments, rather than one particular element.  
[normal]Q21 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Lord Bilimoria[bold]:[bold] If I may declare my interests, including being a member of an LLP and, from Chris
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Sanger’s point of view, I am an alumnus of Ernst
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&amp;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Young and a member of the alumni council.  
[normal]What do you see as the reasons for structuring a business as a partnership as compared with structuring as a company, and what part does tax play in this?  Are you aware of any recent academic studies that attempt to identify and quantify the tax benefits of partnerships?  Did the introduction of LLPs offer additional advantages?  I am sorry; there are quite a few questions there rolled into one.
[normal]Malcolm Gammie:[bold] I 
[normal]will 
[normal]start, perhaps, with the first element of that
[normal].
[normal]  Historically, of course, most entities were conducted through a partnership, because the company is merely a development of the original partnership form.  In more recent times, there has been, in the professional context, a requirement to carry on business in an unincorporated form, which has generally meant partnership.  There are a variety of ways within which business activities can be conducted, and one would anticipate that for the vast majority of them, the choice of form that is being adopted is chosen for entirely commercial reasons as to what fits the organisational framework and relationships between the persons carrying on the business.  Of course, once businesses reach a particular size they may, for example, need to raise capital from external sources, which may be very much easier to do through the corporate form than the partnership form.  There is a whole range of commercial
[normal],
[normal] financial and financing reasons why people structure their businesses in different 
[normal]forms, partnership or company.
[normal]As to what part tax plays, the answer is that tax is almost invariably going to be an element of any decision as to how you conduct your business.  That is because so long as we tax different business entities in different ways, the tax consequences of conducting your business through a partnership, a company or any other form that you care to think of
[normal] 
[normal]will be a relevant consideration
[normal].  I spent some time in 
[normal]Australia
[normal] last year researching the fact that a lot of their small business entities are conducted through business trusts, rather than partnerships.  There are tax reasons why that has developed in 
[normal]Australia
[normal] as compared to here, where business trusts are generally not found to any great extent.  So tax plays a part, and that is purely a factor of dealing with each of these entities in a different way and therefore giving rise to different tax considerations.
[normal]Of course, a lot of structures are put together, whether as companies or as partnerships or trusts or whatever, specifically for tax reasons, because they generate a tax advantage.  However, I do not think we should allow ourselves to be driven by that factor alone.  
[normal]Chris Sanger:[bold] That is absolutely right.  
[normal]The normal 
[normal]context 
[normal]for 
[normal]that type of question is companies wanting to come to the UK and how much tax drives those kinds of decisions, and it is a fair appraisal that the commercial decision is the first thing that matters.  Particularly in a partnership, one of the key questions will be about the partnership ethos, what the partnership set out to do and the driving of the partnership on that basis
[normal]. T
[normal]hen you get on to the ques
[normal]tion of the overall structure.
[normal]On the company side, when we see companies coming to the 
[normal]UK
[normal], tax is normally sixth or seventh on the agenda over decision
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]making, but we tend to get to a decision quite quickly where tax might be one of the motivating factors in a choice between two forms.  I do think commercial is the primary part, but then you will find tax decisions taken into account
[normal] 
[normal]at the margin
[normal].  
[normal]Professor Freedman:[bold] At the small business end, the incentive is almost always to incorporate because of the rate structures at the moment, but for larger firms there are advantages to remaining as partnerships.  There are capital gains tax advantages, there are tax advantages to remaining as partnerships
[normal],
[normal] and the big advantage is, of course, reduced 
[normal]national insurance
[normal].  At the time LLPs were introduced, I kept asking everybody why these fi
[normal]rms could not just incorporate. Y
[normal]ou could easily have changed the regulations to allow that.  I was told all the time that this was because they wanted to retain the partnership ethos.  John
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Lewis
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Partnership is a company that manages to retain, apparently, the partnership ethos, so I was not wholly sold on that explanation, and I think that the 
[normal]national insurance
[normal] explanation was not insignificant.  I think there was a tax reason for those large firms wanting the LLP legislation to be introduced, as it was, but nobody ever admitted that to me.  
[normal]Lord Bilimoria[bold]:[bold] Following that, in 2002, Professor Freedman, you wrote about large professional partnership pressing for LLPs—this is what you are saying—just for tax reasons.
[normal]Professor Freedman:[bold] 
[normal]That 
[normal]is what I am saying.  It was not purely for tax reasons, but I do think that there was a tax element in that pressure.
[normal]Lord Bilimoria[bold]:[bold] You think in the light of subsequent events 
[normal]that 
[normal]this has—
[normal]Professor Freedman:[bold] I am not surprised by the fact that that has then led to avoidance 
[normal]o
[normal]pportunities.  It was fairly predictable and certain steps were taken to close the avoidance opportunities,
[normal] but clearly not quite enough.
[normal]Lord Bilimoria[bold]:[bold] If I may just pursue this, there has been a huge growth of LLPs since they were created.  Do you have any insight as to whether this has been for commercial reasons or tax
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]motivated, in spite of what you have just said?  Can you say that there are clearly bona fide commercial reasons, as distinguished from tax reasons, for forming an LLP?  
[normal]Chris Sanger:[bold] There are 
[normal]clearly 
[normal]bona fide commercial reasons for forming an LLP.  
[normal]T
[normal]he numbers that have been presented by the OTS show quite a large amount.  The fact that under the LLP 
[normal]c
[normal]ode, as will be amended, there is the presumption automatically that a member is treated as self
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]employed, rather than applying what has always been the case for normal partnerships or general partnerships—that you apply the partnership tests as to whether someone really is a partner or a member—will have created the incentive for many people to move into LLPs.  John
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Whiting, in his previous evidence to this Committee, I think said there were 20,000
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]partners who were fruit pickers.  That is clearly a case where I would question whether they were all true partners in the context of a general partnership test in any event.  
[normal]Malcolm Gammie:[bold] My recollection is that one factor behind the introduction of the LLP legislation was the availability of equivalent legal forms in other jurisdictions.  I seem to recall that it was thought at least that if the 
[normal]United
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Kingdom
[normal] did not have an equivalent legal framework, certain entities would use a 
[normal]Channel Islands
[normal] entity as a way of achieving their objectives.  Now that, of course, was not necessarily a tax objective, but 
[normal]it 
[normal]was also providing a framework in which there was limited liability
[normal] and 
[normal]nevertheless 
[normal]was 
[normal]a partnership form of organisation or relationship between those participating.  However, every time you create a new entity you create new opportunities that you do not necessarily anticipate, just as Professor
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Freedman has said.  In this respect, we cannot overlook the fact that many jurisdictions have many different forms of entity, and it is increasingly easy to adopt entities in other jurisdictions, even if you are operating in the 
[normal]United
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Kingdom
[normal]. 
[normal]Professor Freedman:[bold] That is right.  There was litigation at the time, and it did look as though some firms might go to 
[normal]Jersey
[normal], and that meant that the legislation was introduced in a bit of a hurry. 
[normal]Q22 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Lord Bilimoria[bold]:[bold] It has been suggested that HMRC themselves think that partnerships are set up largely for 
[normal]the 
[normal]avoidance of tax.  To what extent are HMRC justified in taking this view?
[normal]Professor Freedman:[bold] Once you have set 
[normal]up 
[normal]the structure in this way, it is perfectly rational and reasonable to use the structure.  If the LLP is available and is taxed in a certain way, I see no reason why it should be described as avoidance to use it in that way.  There are clearly many businesses that are using the LLP form in a perfectly rational and reasonable way, but there probably are some other businesses that are taking advantage of the fact that 
[normal]the legislation has some gaps. 
[normal]Chris Sanger:[bold] In addition, and again the OTS report brings this quite starkly to mind, we have seen the creation of City LLPs, which provides an opportunity for the City for a product that they did not have beforehand
[normal], s
[normal]o some of that might well just be market movement and identification of a use for something that no one originally thought of in the first place.  
[normal]Malcolm Gammie:[bold] There is no bright line, in many respects, between LLPs, partnerships, ordinary partnerships, companies and so on.  Within large organisations you can have a combination of all these different entities to create different structures.  You can have a limited liability partnership whose members may all be corporates, maybe a mixture of individuals and corporates.  They may be ordinary limited partnerships under the 1907
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Act and so on.  It is just that people will use the variety of organisational structures that are available to them, for purely commercial reasons, to fit the business model that they want to achieve in the particular circumstances, but so long as there are tax differences in their treatment they will also exploit them for the differences of tax that are involved in those entities.
[normal]Lord Wakeham[bold]:[bold] I am interested in what you sa
[normal]y, but years ago when I was in g
[normal]overnment I remember receiving lots of representations from big City firms and others
[normal] who
[normal] 
[normal]wanted some form of limited liability because they were worried about the damages that they had to pay in negligence claims and one thing and another.  That was the driving force that they came with, whether that was right or not and whether that is balanced, but it was part of the argument.  It seems to me that they have that with their limi
[normal]ted partnerships, which they did 
[normal]not 
[normal]have
[normal], and their tax system, if they are efficient
[normal] and 
[normal]work it in the way the Inland Revenue now does not want, got them the lower rates of tax, which retained profits wanted.  I just wondered to what extent there was a commercial reason for also wanting limited partnerships, which perhaps is significant. 
[normal]Chris Sanger:[bold] I was going to endorse that approach.  The limitation of liability was, of course, very much at the heart of the debate in relation to the Andersen collapse as an accountancy firm
[normal] in 2000
[normal].  From the professional partnerships’ perspective, that is very much a motivation towards the LLP structure.  
[normal]Professor Freedman:[bold] But they could have achieved that by incorporating.  
[normal]Lord Wakeham[bold]:[bold] Yes, except 
[normal]that 
[normal]if you were a professional firm, were you allowed to trade as a limited company?  I do not know if you were.
[normal]Professor Freedman:[bold] That could easily have been changed by regulations.  They control their own regulations.  It is clearly relevant, but it is not the whole—
[normal]Lord Wakeham[bold]:[bold] I was only asking if it was relevant.  
[normal]Professor Freedman:[bold] Subsequently, it did not quite go far enough to give them the limited liability they wanted, so they had to get further changes to the Companies Act
[normal]. S
[normal]o
[normal] it is only part of the story. 
[normal]Q23 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Lord Leigh of Hurley:[bold] 
[normal]I declare the interests I mentioned at the first hearing.  Without labouring Lord
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Bilimoria’s point, the point of interest is 
[normal]that 
[normal]Professor
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Freedman identifies certain, probably professional, firms that have a partnership ethos that want to carry on that ethos, which one understands.  However, where one has either a new firm or 
[normal]a 
[normal]business starting up or a venture that has grown to a point where they come to you for tax advice, which presumably at a certain size they do, 
[normal]which structure 
[normal]would you 
[normal]tell 
[normal]them 
[normal]was 
[normal]the most tax
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]efficient for a business to run in?
[normal]Chris Sanger:[bold] The first thing is that that is quite a complex decision.  
[normal]W
[normal]ith the changes in corporate tax
[normal] recently
[normal], we have seen the corporate tax rate drop
[normal]. F
[normal]r
[normal]om next year it will be at 20%, which 
[normal]i
[normal]n the G20 is the lowest
[normal]—
[normal]equal with 
[normal]Saudi
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Arabia
[normal] and 
[normal]Russia
[normal].  In addition, we see from a corporate tax perspective 
[normal]that 
[normal]you have access to research and development tax credits.  There are a number of other items where the corporate tax items are different, so you would need to go through and properly evaluate what the overall return was going to be.  You would also need to look at the commercial objectives of the organisation.  One of the benefits of partnership is 
[normal]that 
[normal]you can reward those at the top who are really driving the success of the business, and partnership share is a very important way of doing that, whereas in the corporate space you have the ability to go out for more debt.  If you are expanding into a business that needs capital
[normal]—
[normal]if you have capital requirements for
[normal], say,
[normal] plant and machinery
[normal]—
[normal]rather than that which you can gather from the members of a partnership, you would look to go to a corporate vehicle.  Tax is but one of those, and the decision is not always
[normal] clear, which way or the other.
[normal]Lord Leigh of Hurley:[bold] 
[normal]From what you are saying, where an organisation need
[normal]s
[normal] a lot of capital expenditure or 
[normal]shows 
[normal]comparable signs of looking like a corporate, where you see that as an LLP 
[normal]you 
[normal]would really have to question why they are an LLP. 
[normal]Chris Sanger:[bold] There is a challenge.  
[normal]Under 
[normal]the LLP structure, it is not easy to generate capital.  There are ways to do that, and the limited liability part does make that easier, but it was originally designed with professional partnerships in mind.
[normal]Q24 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Lord Rowe[bold]&#x2011;[bold]Beddoe[bold]:[bold] Professor
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Freedman, when the LLP was introduced in 
[normal]2000, you, I understand, among
[normal] others, predicted that there were avoidance possibilities.  Given the way the legislation was drafted, do you think this ought to have been foreseen or countered by Treasury and HMRC?  
[normal]Professor Freedman:[bold] It is always very easy, with hindsight, to say 
[normal]that 
[normal]things should have been done better, and I do not suppose I could have necessarily done better myself, but it was really the structure and the fact that it was being done in a hurry that worried me.  There were anti
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]avoidance provisions in the original legislation, but there was not very much thought about the 
[normal]national insurance
[normal] aspects and the fact that many people were going to be partners rather than employees. 
[normal]Chris Sanger:[bold] If you look at the changes that are coming in this Finance Bill, as we look at it specifically, it derives from the fact that you have the presumption of self
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]employment.  That was something that was clearly at odds to the general partnership and may be one of the key drivers behind the situation we are in today.  
[normal]Lord Rowe[bold]&#x2011;[bold]Beddoe:[bold] Do you think it was surprising that all members of an LLP would be treated as partners and so self
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]employed for tax purposes?  Was this the angle that you were concerned about? 
[normal]Professor Freedman:[bold] There was an unhealthy focus on the particular people who were asking for the legislation, which were the large partnerships of professional advisers.  There was not enough thought about how others might use those partnerships and that even the professional advisers might then begin to use it to reduce their tax.  However, mostly it was simply because there was not a wide enough overview of how this vehicle might be used when the legislation was introduced.  
[normal]Malcolm Gammie:[bold] Generally speaking, we have significant differences between the way employees and self
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]employed people are taxed in this country and we have never allowed individuals to elect whether they are going to be taxed as one or the other.  It has always been dependent upon looking at the nature of their employment relationship to determine which they are.  However, one of the facets of the LLP was 
[normal]that 
[normal]it was an indirect mechanism by which people could elect which form of taxation the
[normal]y were going to be subject to.
[normal]Chris Sanger:[bold] Your question triggers some thoughts 
[normal]on 
[normal]the other part of your inquiry, which we may go on to later today, which 
[normal]is 
[normal]the making of tax policy and whether, 
[normal]in 
[normal]the current environment, you would have had a greater amount of consultation and a longer period in which to review and identify such concerns. 
[normal]Lord Rowe[bold]&#x2011;[bold]Beddoe:[bold] You mentioned in earlier evidence 
[normal]the 
[normal]20,000 agricultural workers or fruit pickers or whatever it was.  Obviously, that was not, I assume, what the legislation intended to have.  Do you want to amplify that a 
[normal]little
[normal]?  There are gangs of agricultural workers that are outside of fruit pickers, but can you tell me a 
[normal]little
[normal] more about that?
[normal]Chris Sanger:[bold] I was reflecting, as was said before, on the ethos of partnership
[normal]: that 
[normal]being 
[normal]a partner in a business means 
[normal]that you share in both the upside and the downside, and 
[normal]are 
[normal]at risk at times of loss or 
[normal]at 
[normal]times when you definitely do not have a guaranteed salary or items like that.  That is one of the key essences of being a partnership.  With the example that the OTS uses and John used last week of that 20,000, you would have to question whether they satisfied that particular test.  
[normal]Lord Rowe[bold]&#x2011;[bold]Beddoe:[bold] So such a structure really should have been foreseen. 
[normal]Chris Sanger:[bold] As Judith noted, it is easy to sit here with hindsight and look back at this.  I would like to think that the new focus on tax
[normal] 
[normal]policy-making
[normal] would give more time for those things to be foreseen and to give the kind of challenge, 
[normal]which 
[normal]we may come to later.  I still think 
[normal]the 
[normal]Treasury needs to enhance its challenge function on tax policy more generally and be able to really think through the impacts.  History has shown us that when we introduce a new tax regime or we make any change, it will be fine for the moment, but we always design tax policy based on the environment 
[normal]that 
[normal]we have today and where we think it is going to be.  Generally, 
[normal]there 
[normal]is a different environment two, three or four years later, and that is when our tax rules are tested.  
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] As you say, we will come on to the whole process of consultation and so on.  Just going back to the 20,000-members point, was there an inherent fault in the structure of the original legislation, or should that particular instance, for example, have been challenged? 
[normal]Chris Sanger:[bold] I personally believe that the presumption that the members of an LLP are automatically self
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]employed is one of the main causes of the challenge that we have here.  When my firm responded to the consultation that gave rise to the changes in this Finance
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Bill, we said it should go back to the fundamental tests of general partnership applied to an LLP.  At a stroke, that would have dealt with the example of those 20,000
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]partners or so
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]called members of the LLP.
[normal]Lord Leigh of Hurley:[bold] 
[normal]I remember when partnership law restricted it to 20, but that was some time ago.  W
[normal]hat do you think would be the result if the Chancellor
[normal] had
[normal] looked at this in a completely different way and
[normal] had just simply said that 
[normal]national insurance
[normal] will be applied to all earned income
[normal]?
[normal]Chris Sanger:[bold] That would result in a fundamental change to our overall tax system for, effectively, the self
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]employed, and would have driven up overall tax costs.  You would also have to look at the benefits, because there is a difference between the benefits that are received by those who are self
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]employed compared to those who are employed.  If I had
[normal] been asked that question while
[normal] sitting inside 
[normal]the 
[normal]Treasury, I would have most definitely asked Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs or KAI
[normal]—the 
[normal]Knowledge, Analysis 
[normal]&amp;
[normal] Intelligence
[normal] Directorate—
[normal]to do an economic analysis to do that, so I will not presume to judge the outcome.
[normal]Professor Freedman:[bold] That is the crucial question and answer
[normal]s
[normal] many of the problems, 
[normal]including 
[normal]the problem 
[normal]that 
[normal]your colleagues are looking at on the IR35 Committee: 
[normal]that 
[normal]if we could just look at the root of the problem rather than always tackling the symptoms, and if we just had a proper study, as Mirrlees suggested and as the Office of Tax Simplification in its initial report on small businesses suggested, of whether we should in some way bring 
[normal]national insurance
[normal] and tax charges closer together, given that 
[normal]national insurance
[normal] is a tax, that would save an awful lot of trouble in the long run.  However, it is a very big job
[normal]. I
[normal]t is not easy to do.
[normal]Q25 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Baroness Drake:[bold] If I could declare an interest, I am an independent member of the Walker Guidelines Monitoring Group for the private equity industry.
[normal]Staying with this issue of employee or partner, and the folly that followed from the presumption of self
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]employment, the draft legislation still does not impose the general partnership law test to determine whether 
[normal]someone is a 
[normal]partner or employee, and 
[normal]it 
[normal]has these new mechanical economic tests—variable profits, influence over management and capital contribution.  Do you think it would have been simpler and more coherent to stay with or extend the general partnership law tests, and why do you think the Government did not stay with them?
[normal]Chris Sanger:[bold] We do absolutely believe it would have been simpler to reinforce the tests.  At the moment, assuming these laws go through, we will have one particular treatment for the LLP structures and another treatment for English general partnerships and, indeed, for foreign partnerships, so we will have both rules running side by side.  Generally, we try to avoid having two systems that apply in a similar but slightly different manner.  As I mentioned, our response to the consultation specifically recommended that we reinstated the tests that applied to the English general partnership to the LLP.  HMRC has commented publicly in its response to the consultation that it did not believe that that would provide sufficient clarity because the rules were open for question.  That is an odd response given it has been clarified through the courts in a number of ways and, effectively, we are producing new rules that will have had no testing and will then themselves have to be clarified by the courts or by guidance.  We are potentially ending up again in a slightly unfortunate situation where we have some fairly broad legislation and that clarity 
[normal]is 
[normal]delivered not through legislation but through guidance, which is HMRC’s interpretation of the law rather than giving taxpayers the clarity they would expect.  So our recommendation was and remains that it should go back to the tried and tested rules that will still apply for
[normal] English general partnerships. 
[normal]Malcolm Gammie:[bold] I am not sure that I would necessarily say it was simpler.  In a sense, the LLP in its current form is simple
[normal];
[normal] it is just that we do not like the consequences that it produces, given the differences we have between taxing employees and those who are in an ordinary general partnership relationship.  If you have an entity where essentially you have a number of members and you have to try to draw a line between those whom you think are really in a relationship of partnership and those who are just employees, that is not necessarily going to be a simple thing to do, but it is difficult to think of alternative tests if that is the basic structure in which you have your tax system.  
[normal]Q26 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Lord Leigh of Hurley:[bold] 
[normal]Just looking at the situation where you have partnership with
[normal] mixed membership, t
[normal]he policy seemed to be to try 
[normal]to
[normal] stop moving profits between the two
[normal] simply for
[normal] tax.  Does this happen in practice
[normal] and is it for bona fide commercial reasons
[normal],
[normal] or is it simply to take advantage of the situation for the benefit of reducing the overall tax burden
[normal]? 
[normal]Malcolm Gammie:[bold] Speaking for myself, I can say 
[normal]that 
[normal]I am aware that there are structures out there that use companies in this way.  I could not possibly say to what extent; it is a matter of general application or whether it meets particular circumstances.  It is obviously one way in which, through an appropriate structure, you can retain amounts within the overall entity and pay tax at the corporate rates
[normal],
[normal] and there may be perfectly good commercial reasons why you want to achieve that objective, whether related to the funding of the business or related to the way in which the members of the LLP are going to be rewarded.  Of course, from the Revenue’s perspective that look
[normal]s
[normal] like avoidance to the extent that amounts ultimately accrue to the benefit of the individual members rather than to the corporate entity, which is effectively an intermediate holding structure.  However, we could argue to the end of the day which are avoidance and which are not avoidance; it is just a use of the different forms and entities that we have and the way in which they are taxed.  
[normal]Lord Leigh of Hurley:[bold] 
[normal]Is it
[normal] to try to convert income into capital?  Is that the reason why you set up these structures with corporate membership?
[normal]  
[normal]Malcolm Gammie:[bold] It is very difficult to speak in general terms because one does not know.  These are not things that are necessarily the subject of general public knowledge; we are talking about private structures and so on.  Of course, some of them may be used to try to convert income into capital, some may just be being used to get the benefit of the lower corporate tax rate and others might be used for entirely nefarious purposes of putting profits offshore and not taxed at all.  I do not know.  It is just a function of having a variety of different structures taxed in a different way. 
[normal]Chris Sanger:[bold] The other reason why you might have a corporate structure could well be for asset ownership or for property, where you may want a corporate that can sign leases or other commercial reasons as well, so there are other commercial reasons for why corporates might be useful.  
[normal]Lord Leigh of Hurley:[bold] 
[normal]So you are saying that they are in addition to tax
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]planning reasons.  So there are tax
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]planning reasons why people do this
[normal]:
[normal] to have a mixed structure in some instances pu
[normal]rely for tax
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]planning reasons.
[normal]Chris Sanger:[bold] There are, in addition, commercial reasons for why there may well be a benefit to having a corporate in the overall structure.
[normal]Lord Leigh of Hurley:[bold] 
[normal]Do you think the proposed legislation will work in stopping the movement of profit around?
[normal]Chris Sanger:[bold] We are still looking at the draft legislation at the moment
[normal]. It 
[normal]is clearly out to consultation until the beginning of February.  It is a complex piece of legislation.  I can see where the Revenue are trying to get to
[normal]. 
[normal]I am not quite sure whether they will achieve it as yet.  
[normal]Professor Freedman:[bold] I do not want to add anything to that, but 
[normal]may I return to 
[normal]Baroness Drake
[normal]’s
[normal] point about the case law?  It seems to me that one of the problems—and the response of HMRC to the consultation responses shows this—is that they apply the case law in a certain way, looking at certain factors as if they were rigid, whereas in fact the case law is all about looking at the substance, not the form.  So it does not matter that people have holiday pay or not, which is one of the reasons they give for it being problematic, because that is only one small factor in the case law.  If they do not think that this case law is clear enough in the case of partnerships—LLPs—why do they think it is clear enough to use in the case of IR35?  
[normal]Q27 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Baroness Drake:[bold] Just staying there, perhaps I ought to declare 
[normal]that 
[normal]I am a member of the Employment Appeal Tribunal, so I hear some of these cases of whether someone is an employee based on their situation.  Do you think the new test could produce new anomalous results 
[normal]for 
[normal]the status of people? 
[normal]Professor Freedman:[bold] I am sure it will.  There will be a lot more cases.  There will be a difference between the person’s employment status for employment purposes and for tax purposes.  Where should 
[normal]national insurance
[normal] be there?  I do not know.  It will be with the tax, but is that fair?  If you are going to be judged on whether you are an employee or not for the purposes of certain benefits and you are paying 
[normal]national insurance
[normal] as if you are an employee, how will
[normal] that
[normal] impact on you as an employment tribunal member?  I do not know.  Will you take it into account or will you not?  These are all questions 
[normal]that 
[normal]we do not know the answer to and that raise uncertainties. 
[normal]Baroness Drake:[bold] Do you think it could lead to some significant LLPs restructuring their partnership agreements in order to build it explicitly around those tests?
[normal]Professor Freedman:[bold] It is clear that they are all having to rethink their partnership agreements and before April as well, because they have set them up under certain rules and now they are all having to re
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]examine them.  That will not necessarily be about avoidance; it is just about knowing how their people are going to be taxed.  I have no idea what they will do, but they may well try to think of new ways of structuring.  
[normal]Malcolm Gammie:[bold] I would endorse what Professor
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Freedman has said.  Experience tells you that all these changes merely shift the ground on which the argument takes place, because you are not addressing the fundamental problem that underlies all this
[normal],
[normal] an
[normal]d that is part of the problem.
[normal]To pick up the final point that was made by Lord
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Leigh, even if
[normal] 
[normal]the change in the rules for mixed partnerships
[normal] is successful, 
[normal]there will inevitably still be attempts to structure on the basis of the new rules.  However, the balance that you are always trying to achieve in this area is between stopping what you do not like at the moment—and it is not always easy to see what is or is not liked at a particular moment—without inhibiting genuine commercial structures for which there is a commercial need to adopt maybe a partnership form or a mixed partnership form.  It is that very difficult balance between not inhibiting the commercial but stopping what you do not like that is the balance that is sought 
[normal]to be achieved.
[normal]Lord Bilimoria:[bold] Can we just pursue this?  Is there not an unintended consequence in that you can have a member of an LLP also being treated as an employee under the wording of the 2000
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Act?  How do you explain 
[normal]the fact t
[normal]hat you can have somebody who is a partner and also be—I think it is 
[normal]in 
[normal]S
[normal]ection
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](4)
[normal]?
[normal]Malcolm Gammie:[bold] The question is to what extent that provision of the LLP Act 2000 has effect for tax purposes, given the specific deeming that there is for tax purposes that a member of the LLP is a partner for tax purposes.  There is a tension between what the general law in the LLP Act says and what the deeming for tax purposes is, whic
[normal]h you have drawn attention to. 
[normal]Baroness Drake:[bold] This issue of the test for distinguishing partner from employee has obviously excited quite a few people.  How do you feel that that particular issue was dealt with under the new approach to taxation policy and consultation in particular?  Do you think it was fairly thorough or do you think that was a particular provision in the proposals that could have been iterated more thoroughly? 
[normal]Chris Sanger:[bold] Reading the response to 
[normal]the 
[normal]consultation, one of the key challenges in 
[normal]the 
[normal]consultation to date has been that you do not understand why 
[normal]the G
[normal]overnment 
[normal]have
[normal] taken the decision 
[normal]they have
[normal].  They have three sentences that basically dismiss the idea that you should apply the rules that apply to general partnerships to the LLP, and it is a good challenge to ask them to explain why, because it seem
[normal]s
[normal] that we had a test that worked
[normal],
[normal] that has stood the test of time and that has been overwritten by error almost, if you like, in relation to the original changes.  I do not think that the explanation given to date makes it v
[normal]ery clear why the Government have
[normal] decided to go down a set of independent rules. 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] That almost brings us on to the question of the approach to consultation and so on, but just before we do that, are there any other points that you would like to make on what we have been discussing so far?   
[normal]Baroness Wheatcroft:[bold] If I may, I would like to ask you all, from your own experience, how many partners you think an LLP can genuinely have and function as a partnership
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]It is o
[normal]bviously not 20,000.
[normal]Chris Sanger:[bold] It is a very good question.  If one goes down to the nature of the ethos of partnership, in the past you probably had a small number, because it is quite difficult to get people together to think through and agree things as a partnership.  I attended a partners’ meeting this morning, which was held via webca
[normal]st and same
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]time communication, 
[normal]with questions back and forth, looking at where our results were and all those items.  
[normal]That was a
[normal]bsolutely a true engagement of partnership with real challenge to the questions of what we are doing, where we are investing, how we see the market—
[normal]all
[normal] that kind of approach.  It is difficult to look at the numbers, and there are extremes.  We are a partnership of just over 500
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]partners.  One of the things that attracted me to where I am now at EY was that partnership ethos of being there
[normal] and 
[normal]driving the business forward with a group of like
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]minded and somewhat challenging partners who will keep your mind active.  The high numbers 
[normal]are 
[normal]not a test on 
[normal]their 
[normal]own; it is about the whole ethos and the way 
[normal]the
[normal] partnership works.
[normal]Professor Freedman:[bold] I do not really understand why the legal form has to dictate the institutional arrangements.  That description of a partners’ meeting sounded a bit like a description of a shareholders’ meeting or, indeed, a meeting at a university.  You can have all sorts of different institutional arrangements and still have engagement, so I am not convinced, but I have never been a partner
[normal],
[normal] so perhaps that is why. 
[normal]The Chairman[bold]:[bold] If there are no other points that you would like to make on what we have been discussing so far, perhaps we could move on to the new approach to tax
[normal] 
[normal]policy
[normal]-
[normal]making.  
[normal]Q28 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Baroness Wheatcroft:[bold] This stems from Baroness
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Drake’s question really.  The conversation this afternoon has shown that the policy-making in this instance was not ideal, but I know that you, Mr
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Gammie and Mr
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Sanger, have been involved in the organisation looking at the making of tax policy and reporting on how effectively the new approach is working.  Your first report I think was more sanguine than the second.  I wonder if you could bring us up to date with your latest thinking on this.  
[normal]Malcolm Gammie:[bold] The important aspect of the Tax Professionals Forum is that it is designed to focus on the process rather than the substance of the policy.  Of course, at meetings there is a huge temptation to want to discuss the policy that has been adopted, but that is not really the function of the 
[normal]f
[normal]orum and, from my perspective, I see that as a very important aspect of it.  Partnerships
[normal] are 
[normal]a very good illustration of this tension between what one might describe as good policy and the responses in 
[normal]the form 
[normal]of good policy and the process by which 
[normal]the 
[normal]Government, for whatever reason, 
[normal]have 
[normal]taken particular policy decisions and by what process 
[normal]they 
[normal]should press them forward.  In many respects, it seems to me that the mechanisms and processes by which 
[normal]the Government consult on the policy and push
[normal] it forward to legislation have been working fairly well under the new arrangements, but of course that still leaves large question marks over whether it is the right policy or indeed, for example in the partnership area, whether it is addressing the right question.  
[normal]Chris Sanger:[bold] I am not sure I recognise the 
[normal]point 
[normal]that our second report was less positive than the first.  They slightly focused on different items.  The first 
[normal]looked
[normal] at the whole part of the tax policy and new approach and the way it was working, and the second looked in more detail.  In addition, with the second, we had had the protocol in relation to immediate announcements of tax policy, which we looked at.  
[normal]Before coming to this Committee I re
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]read our two reports, and it was interesting to see that each of those reports had both good things and less good examples of engagement on tax policy.  
[normal]In the 
[normal]2011 one, we had things like the CFC as an example of really positive engagement throughout the process, and I may come back to that process in a moment.  Then we had some problematic ones in relation to things like disguised remuneration, which I know this Committee itself looked at in relation to the 2011 one.  There were some good and less good examples, and the same was true in relation to the 2012 ones.  
[normal]On things like, again,
[normal] the CFC, the statutory residence, 
[normal]the 
[normal]non
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]dom examples
[normal], 
[normal]the proposals were put through all five tests.  Nonetheless we had, dare I say, the pasty tax and other challenges in that one, so I think they both showed that the process is working.  
[normal]In 
[normal]Tax 
[normal]Policy-making
[normal]: 
[normal]A New Approach
[normal], there is much more formality around how we go forward with tax policy
[normal]. T
[normal]hat provides a real opportunity for many more people to be engaged in the debate
[normal],
[normal] and that is absolutely to the good.  There will always be examples, but the fact that I am citing examples of where it has dropped means that they are, almost by definition, the exception.  We are moving to a world where good policy
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]making and good communication of that policy 
[normal]are 
[normal]becoming the norm, and that is a good result.  I hope that when we come to the 2013 review, which will be out shortly, we will find 
[normal]that 
[normal]we are in the same position.  There are clearly some good examples and there are clearly some less good examples.  As Malcolm said, 
[normal]and 
[normal]speaking in a personal capacity, one of 
[normal]my 
[normal]concerns 
[normal]would 
[normal]be the 
[normal]four-week 
[normal]consultation on tax and procurement that 
[normal]went
[normal] right up to a very hard deadline.  That 
[normal]is 
[normal]clearly 
[normal]less 
[normal]good for this forthcoming report, but I will 
[normal]discuss
[normal] it with our fellow members.  
[normal]Baroness Wheatcroft:[bold] Would it be your theory that it 
[normal]tends to work
[normal] less well when there is a wish to do something quickly?  
[normal]Chris Sanger:[bold] When you are pushing something through very
[normal] quickly and you have less time 
[normal]to think, it clearly leaves you more exposed to lapses in the policy-making.  It is worth reflecting on what drove the creation of the 
[normal]f
[normal]orum.  The tax
[normal] 
[normal]policy-making approach listed five areas of concern that set up the creation of 
[normal]the forum
[normal] and the overall approach.  If I may list them, there was the lack of a clear strategy for the tax system; consulting too late in the policy development cycle; the length and complexity of the tax code; uncertainty due to the volume and timing 
[normal]of tax changes; and inadequate p
[normal]arliamentary scrutiny of tax legislation.  If I reflect on where that takes us in terms of 
[normal]tax policy-making
[normal], we have seen some clear strategy in relation to the tax system as a whole.  When I spoke to this Committee previously, we spoke about the 
[normal]corporate tax road map 
[normal]providing a strategy of where the corporate tax system would go.  That has been a good
[normal] outcome of the policy approach:
[normal] engaging with business and with interested parties about where the system would be.  
[normal]From personal reflection, I would like to see that developed further.  Rather than a corporate tax 
[normal]road map
[normal], picking up 
[normal]on 
[normal]what Judith mentioned as well, maybe 
[normal]there should be 
[normal]a business tax road map and a personal tax road map—something that gave you t
[normal]hat kind of focus on strategy.
[normal]The reports show that the second part, consulting late in the policy development cycle, has been improved.  As I already mentioned, there are a number of places where, to my mind, there have been lapses, but there is definitely improvement.  
[normal]The length and complexity of the tax code is probably more a question for John
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Whiting with his OTS hat on.  I do not think we have seen much, if any, improvement of that; the pile of my books on legislation just grows ever higher.
[normal]On the u
[normal]ncertainty due to the volume and timing of tax changes
[normal], 
[normal]it is very pleasant to know 
[normal]sufficiently in advance 
[normal]when the Budget is going to be and to be able to see 
[normal]some level of certainty there.
[normal]Finally, 
[normal]on 
[normal]the last point about increased 
[normal]parliamentary
[normal] scrutiny of tax legislation
[normal], C
[normal]ommittees like you here and elsewhere have definitely improved the overall focus.  
[normal]To reflect back to the question, I do think we are seeing some posit
[normal]ive moves forward on tax policy-
[normal]making.
[normal]Baroness Wheatcroft:[bold] Thank you very much.  Professor
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Freedman, do you have anything to add to that?
[normal]Professor Freedman:[bold] Yes.  I am not in 
[normal]the forum
[normal], but there is masses of consultation and that is all very well, but sometimes I am not sure that HMRC and 
[normal]the 
[normal]Treasury know quite what to do with it.  Unless you go out consulting with some clear background knowledge so that you can evaluate what is coming back, there is a danger that you lose your way.  I am not saying that this is necessarily deliberate lobbying
[normal]. I
[normal]t might be, but it might just be 
[normal]that 
[normal]technical points 
[normal]are 
[normal]being made that are then put into the legislation—I have seen examples of this—where they do not really fit, because the people who have received the responses think it must be a good point if it has come from clever people but they do not really see where it fits.  That can mess up the legislation quite badly, so there needs to be quite a lot of knowledge in order to evaluate the consultations, and so a road map would be helpful.  However, you also need quite detailed knowledge, and sometimes the people working on the consultations, who are all very, very bright, have just not had long enough in the area to know about that detail and so mistakes are made that way.  
[normal]The other thing I would say is that we are also still not very good at looking at these tax
[normal] 
[normal]policy changes in a wider context and in a holistic context.  We are not looking at benefits legislation at the same time as we are looking at tax
[normal]. W
[normal]e are not looking at employment law
[normal]. W
[normal]e are not looking at partnership law when we are changing partnerships.  There is not enough joined-up 
[normal]g
[normal]overnment here, so that can cause problems
[normal]. One 
[normal]of the problems with this partnership legislation was that it was being led by DTI, as it then was, and perhaps there was not enough input from HMRC.  
[normal]Baroness Wheatcroft:[bold] The silo approach. 
[normal]Professor Freedman: [bold]Yes.  
[normal]Baroness Wheatcroft:[bold] Mr
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Gammie, do you have anything to add? 
[normal]Malcolm Gammie:[bold] No, I think Mr
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Sanger has dealt fairly comprehensively with what I would say on the matter.
[normal]Q29 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Mr
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Sanger, you mentioned the pasty tax.  There will always be little bits of the Finance Bill that 
[normal]deal
[normal] with what are seen as particular problems or particular opportunities or for political reasons
[normal]. T
[normal]here will always be those sorts of things.  You would draw a distinction between that, including some that we used to call “lollipops”, and the wider tax structural changes and so on for which the consultation process was really meant.  You are not suggesting that every small tax change should be subject to consultation.  
[normal]Chris Sanger:[bold] No, I am not suggesting that every small tax should be subject to consultation.  However, there is a fundamental challenge when you make any change to the tax system, because it will necessarily change the environment
[normal],
[normal] and tax motivate
[normal]s
[normal] behaviour at the margin, so it is sensible to review.  Sometimes it is dangerous to proceed with policy changes unless they have been consulted on, because having that knowledge about how the tax system applies in practice is really important.  
[normal]I would 
[normal]look at the way 
[normal]the 
[normal]Treasury and HMRC are structured right now
[normal]. W
[normal]e used to have an environment where
[normal] 
[normal]the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise, in those days, owned tax policy changes and the role of Her Majesty’s Treasury was to have that strategic view and to challenge the outcome of Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise.  If 
[normal]the 
[normal]Treasury 
[normal]w
[normal]anted to implement a particular change, 
[normal]it 
[normal]would ask the Inland Revenue experts and the Customs and Excise experts to design the change
[normal],
[normal] and then 
[normal]it 
[normal]would engage in discussion and challenge what that change was going to be.  
[normal]I am not sure whether the so
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]called pasty tax is an example of this, but there is a danger in the current system that 
[normal]the 
[normal]Treasury has taken on board quite a lot of the people from HMRC, and they now have a kind of policy origination function as well as 
[normal]the function 
[normal]they used to have in 
[normal]relation to 
[normal]policy strategy and policy challenge.  There is a danger that with a policy originated inside HM
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Treasury it may not get to, if you like, the depths and the specialists within HMRC who might well be able to say, “In practice, that is not going to work in my esoteric part of the tax system”.
[normal] I
[normal]f policies were more owned at the HMRC level, you might find that some of the idiosyncrasies of the tax system that would just 
[normal]be 
[normal]lost on policy officials sitting in HM
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Treasury, however hard they were to try, would be picked up and 
[normal]perhaps 
[normal]dealt with before 
[normal]they were 
[normal]released in draft legislation or consultation.
[normal]Q30 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Baroness Blackstone:[bold] The 2011 report of this 
[normal]s
[normal]ub
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]c
[normal]ommittee recommended that the Government should commit 
[normal]themselves 
[normal]to post
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]implementation reviews, which would be independent, when large tax changes had taken place.  The recommendation was not taken up by 
[normal]g
[normal]overnment
[normal]. 
[normal]I do not think any of us were on the Committee at the time.  I wonder whether you could tell us to what extent the Government’s existing monitoring and evaluation arrangements meet the objectives and standards of independent review.  
[normal]Malcolm Gammie:[bold] By definition, they cannot be independent in the sense that 
[normal]the implementation 
[normal]is being done by people who may be principally responsible for their operational implementation and who will have a particular perspective of provisions.  In that sense, I would have said that there was still considerable scope for a much greater degree of independent standing back and looking at what we have.  
[normal]Just to pick up the five headings that Mr
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Sanger referred to in relation to the policy objectives, as he notes it would be very difficult to say 
[normal]that 
[normal]we have had much success in limiting the scale of legislation that is introduced and the sheer scale and complexity of that legislation, but it is very difficult to assess that anybody at any officially recognised level stands back and reviews that.  One assumes that reviews occur within the Treasury and the Revenue, and it may be that they can 
[normal]come and 
[normal]speak to this Committee in a bit more detail about what they do, but I would suspect that they come at a lot of these issues with a rather more limited eye than I certainly would think desirable in trying to tackle some of the ongoing problems of the tax system.  
[normal]Baroness Blackstone:[bold] Is it the intention of the Tax Professionals Forum to take on post
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]implementation reviews of this kind?  
[normal]Malcolm Gammie:[bold] I do not think that is in our remit.  
[normal]The extent to which this might be done 
[normal]is obviously an aspect of the discussion that has occ
[normal]urred at some of the meetings, 
[normal]but I do not think it is one of our specific remits.  In some ways, it does not have to be done at an official level.  The Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Tax Law Review Committee, to an extent, can and do take on this sort of role, but inevitably external reviews of that sort may have less impact than if you had something within the institutional framework to see that it is done.
[normal]Baroness Blackstone:[bold] You are not arguing for your remit being changed so that you could encompass this sort of work. 
[normal]Malcolm Gammie:[bold] I do not think I would necessarily be against a change in the remit so that it included that, but you have to recollect that we are a voluntary body dealing with these things.  Generally speaking, given the scale of the consultation that Professor
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Freedman has referred to, we have our work cut out just monitoring what is going on let alone standing back and reviewing what 
[normal]was
[normal] put in place a few years ago.  
[normal]Chris Sanger:[bold] It 
[normal]may be 
[normal]worth reflecting that the Treasury’s own 
[normal]Green Book
[normal], 
[normal]Appraisal and Evaluation in Central Government
[normal], suggest
[normal]s
[normal] that all policy-
[normal]making that it imposes or requests of other 
[normal]government departments 
[normal]follows the so
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]called ROAMEF approach
[normal]: 
[normal]rational, objectives, appraisal, monitoring
[normal], 
[normal]and 
[normal]“EF”
[normal]—
[normal]evaluation and feedback.  So I think it is perfectly right that others should be looking to Treasury to follow its own advice in relation to the “EF” of ROAMEF.
[normal]Baroness Blackstone:[bold] What has happened since the 2011 
[normal]sub
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]committee’s 
[normal]report does not lead any of you to believe that there is no issue here
[normal].
[normal]  There is an issue and it is something 
[normal]which 
[normal]the Committee ought to pursue.  Would I be right in concluding that from what you have said? 
[normal]Chris Sanger:[bold] As Mr
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Gammie said, there is little evidence to the outside world of those reviews being undertaken.  
[normal]They 
[normal]may be happening inside 
[normal]the 
[normal]Treasury and HMRC, but it would be good 
[normal]for 
[normal]the outcome of that 
[normal]to be far more visible
[normal].  Indeed, 
[normal]going 
[normal]back from this Committee to the Tax Professionals Forum, our role is, as Mr
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Gammie set out, to look at the way policy is made and those last parts will encourage us to engage further on the “EF”.  
[normal]Baroness Blackstone:[bold] If they are doing these reviews, are you implying that they really ought to be published so that they 
[normal]can be more widely scrutinised?
[normal]Chris Sanger:[bold] There will be some things in relation to the reviews that may need to be confidential, because they may need access to taxpayer information, but there should be a natural part of reviewing the outcome of legislation and that can only be to the good. 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] You can be sure that these are questions that we will be asking of HMRC and 
[normal]the 
[normal]Treasury when they come in front of us as part of this inquiry.  
[normal]Q31 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Lord Wakeham:[bold] In your last few answers, you have answered most of the points that I was going to ask in my question, so my question is pretty simple: do you think 
[normal]that 
[normal]the proposals for changes in the partnership legislation live up to the high standards that you think have been achieved in the past and are intended in the new policy? 
[normal]Malcolm Gammie:[bold] Do you mean in the way in which they have been implemented? 
[normal]Lord Wakeham:[bold] The way they have been discussed and promoted.
[normal]Malcolm Gammie:[bold] The consultation process is obviously continuing.  There are elements of it that have not necessarily quite 
[normal]come up 
[normal]to the standard that one would hope to have seen, but we are in an ongoing process, so perhaps one should reserve final judgement on that until we see what the final product is.  
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] That sounds a very tactful answer, if I may say so.  Can I thank all three of you very much indeed for yet again giving us the benefit of your experience and views?  You are very welcome to stay on for the next witnesses if you wish to do so, but thank you, because you have also raised points that we will be raising later in other sessions, for example, with HMRC and 
[normal]the 
[normal]Treasury.  Thank you very much.
