defaultQ17 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairmandefault:default Welcome to the second meeting of the Economic Affairs Committee’s Finance Bill Sub
default&#x2011;
defaultCommittee 2014.  As is now clear, we are looking into selected aspects of the draft Finance Bill published in December.  We have selected the taxation of partnerships, which is one of the more controversial aspects of the Bill and we intend to publish our report in early March, so that it is available for scrutiny in the House of Commons.  Lists of Members’ interest
defaults declared as relevant to this i
defaultnquiry are in the room and available to the public and to witnesses.  
defaultProfessor
default&#xa0;
defaultFreedman, Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultGammie and Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultSanger, welcome.  It is good to see you again, dealing with the Finance Bill as we have done in the past.  Thank you for coming.  Would anyone like to make
default an opening statement, 
defaultor 
defaultshal
defaultl we go straight to questions?
defaultChris Sanger: defaultNo
default,
default thank you.
default  
defaultMalcolm Gammie:default Perhaps I could just say—and this may go for Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultSanger as well—that, as noted, we are members of the Tax Professionals Forum.  Obviously I and
default,
default I think, Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultSanger appear here in our personal capacity
default. We are not speaking for the f
defaultorum.
defaultThe Chairmandefault:default Understood.
defaultProfessor Freedman:default Perhaps I should also say that I am here in my personal capacity, and although I am called the Pinsent Masons 
defaultp
defaultrofessor, I am not employed by Pinsent
default&#xa0;
defaultMasons; they simply give a donation to 
defaultOxford
default 
defaultUniversity
default.  
defaultQ18 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairmandefault:default Yes, I think we understand that very well.  All the questions are open to you all but, as before, if you simply agree with whoever has answered the question first, it is not necessary for you to feel that you have to repeat the same points.  If you are particularly strongly in favour, if you nod, I will make sure that 
defaultis recorded in the transcript.
defaultCan we begin with a very general question?  As is very clear from all the evidence that we have and our first session, there is a very wide range of businesses and firms structured as partnerships, with a significant impact on the economy and certainly with very different sizes.  Is it right that the whole range of partnerships should be taxed in essentially the same way?  
defaultMalcolm Gammie:default One starting point is to say that a partnership is merely one of the various forms in which business and other activities can be carried on and, ideally, you would want to tax all those different structures in a way that ensured that people who were earning similar amounts in respect of their activities were paying similar amounts of tax.  Of course, we very rarely achieve that particular objective as part of our tax system, but unless there is some objective difference between the way in which partnerships are structured and are being used in a particular way, you would probably try to tax them similarly.  
defaultChris Sanger:default If I can add to that, the same question could be applied to companies more generally.  We have a single system of taxation that applies to all companies, and if you take the nuance of the partnership, given 
defaultthat 
defaultthe partnership is
default 
defaulttax transparent, if you were to take a different approach to the members or partners of that partnership, you 
defaultwould 
defaultdo it at the partner or member level rather than at the partnership level itself.
defaultProfessor Freedman:default I would agree on the neutrality point.  I would just add that every time a new kind of tax creature is created you create new opportunities, so the idea of having special rules for certain partnerships may seem superficially attractive but will create problems because there will then be arbitr
defaultage and avoidance around that.
defaultQ19 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairmandefault:default I know, Professor Freedman, 
defaultthat 
defaultyou have a special interest in small and medium
default&#x2011;
defaultsized businesses and, again from the evidence we have been hearing so far, there is a particularly wide range.  On one side, there are the very large professional partnerships and, on the other side, the husband and wife or two
default&#x2011;
defaultperson small business.  Do you think that taxing the very small partnerships in the same way is the best approach? 
defaultProfessor Freedman:default Ideally, some of the largest partnerships should be corporations and should be taxed as corporations.  However, I do agree with Malcolm
default&#xa0;
defaultGammie that the ideal should be to reduce the differences as much as possible between the different types of taxation, rather than creating new differences.  One can say that the husband
default&#x2011;
defaultand
default&#x2011;
defaultwife business looks very, very different from the 500
default&#xa0;
defaultpartnership, but there is a spectrum and you have to decide where you draw the line across that spectrum
default,
default and that is much more difficult to do.  It is very easy when you look at the paradigm cases at each end, but it is much, much more difficult to find a threshold
default. And 
defaultthen you have to decide why you want to tax them differently.  
defaultY
defaultou might want to tax them differently 
defaultbecause 
defaultthe husband
default&#x2011;
defaultand
default&#x2011;
defaultwife partnership 
defaultare 
defaultessentially earning income from their input and very rarely have any capital, whereas the large 500
default&#x2011;
defaultpartner business probably has capital invested and some of the return is a return on capital.  
defaultThe Chairmandefault:default But you are not suggesting, despite that comment, that there should be any general change in the way of partnership taxation.
defaultProfessor Freedman:default I am not suggesting that.  We have to find a way of taxing across the board so that we recognise 
defaultthe 
defaultdifferent types of income that are coming out of those businesses.  There are suggestions on the table in the
default 
defaultMirrlees
default&#xa0;
defaultreview
default, in the chapter that I wrote and then the subsequent volume that Malcolm edited, on how one could do that.  
defaultQ20 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairmandefault:default One of the points that have been coming up is the taxation of partnership profits retained for expansion of the business.  Ought there to be some way of retaining profits at a lower tax rate?
defaultMalcolm Gammie:default Of course, within a corporate entity retained profits are only taxed at the corporate rate.  The distinction with a transparent partnership would ordinarily be that the profits are taxed at the personal tax rate and then retained in the business, so it has frequently been argued that retained profits should benefit from a lower tax rate in a similar way that corporate retained profits can do so.  Again, it is a distinction between the way in which we tax two different entities that can, in fact, look very similar in terms of the activities and organisation and funding that is going on through those different organisations.  Insofar as you want to be consistent in the way in which you want to treat them, you might say there are good arguments for taxing retained profits at a lower rate.  On the other hand, you might argue that in relation to many small companies that are not much different from partnerships, perhaps retained profits should be taxed at the personal rate.  
defaultThe Chairmandefault:default You posed the question
default. D
defaulto you have a view about the answer?
defaultMalcolm Gammie:default At the moment, we are embedded in the system of taxing corporate profits at the corporate rate even when they are retained.  We abolished 
defaultthe 
defaultapportionment of corporate profits back in about 1988 or1989 and, of course, as the differential between personal and corporate tax rates has increased, it puts more pressure on the distinction that exists.  So long as we are going to stay in that way, there would be arguments—maybe good arguments—for taxing retained profits in partnerships in the same way.  However, whereas a corporate entity gives you effectively the structure or the shell with which you can distinguish retained and distributed profits, that is far more difficult in a partnership context where withdrawals from the partnership and the ability of partners to enjoy the benefit of profits, which appear to be retained but in fact are being enjoyed for personal use, may be far more difficult to discern.
defaultThe Chairmandefault:default I think you were nodding.
defaultProfessor Freedman:default I agree.  There are two very separate legal structures
default. T
defaulthey have different legal rights
default,
default duties and organisation, and people have to choose between them.  There are benefits of having a partnership and there are benefits of having a corporation.  At the moment, that is the way it is, and you cannot let people pick and mix the bits that they want, because that again will just give rise to avoidance opportunities.  It would be very difficult to control that system of taxing retained earnings at a lower rate within a partnership
default. W
defaulthat do you mean by “retention”
default,
default and so on?  It is much harder to define than with a corporation.
defaultChris Sanger:default If I could add to that, there is an essence of difference between partnership, which 
defaultis 
defaultgenerally particularly in the professional partnerships, which generate the capital from the members, where you have ownership and management of the partnership in one compared to a corporate, where you clearly have the distinction between the management of the company and the shareholders.  If you were looking at making a change, you would look across the whole range of other treatments, rather than one particular element.  
defaultQ21 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Bilimoriadefault:default If I may declare my interests, including being a member of an LLP and, from Chris
default&#xa0;
defaultSanger’s point of view, I am an alumnus of Ernst
default&#xa0;
default&amp;
default&#xa0;
defaultYoung and a member of the alumni council.  
defaultWhat do you see as the reasons for structuring a business as a partnership as compared with structuring as a company, and what part does tax play in this?  Are you aware of any recent academic studies that attempt to identify and quantify the tax benefits of partnerships?  Did the introduction of LLPs offer additional advantages?  I am sorry; there are quite a few questions there rolled into one.
defaultMalcolm Gammie:default I 
defaultwill 
defaultstart, perhaps, with the first element of that
default.
default  Historically, of course, most entities were conducted through a partnership, because the company is merely a development of the original partnership form.  In more recent times, there has been, in the professional context, a requirement to carry on business in an unincorporated form, which has generally meant partnership.  There are a variety of ways within which business activities can be conducted, and one would anticipate that for the vast majority of them, the choice of form that is being adopted is chosen for entirely commercial reasons as to what fits the organisational framework and relationships between the persons carrying on the business.  Of course, once businesses reach a particular size they may, for example, need to raise capital from external sources, which may be very much easier to do through the corporate form than the partnership form.  There is a whole range of commercial
default,
default financial and financing reasons why people structure their businesses in different 
defaultforms, partnership or company.
defaultAs to what part tax plays, the answer is that tax is almost invariably going to be an element of any decision as to how you conduct your business.  That is because so long as we tax different business entities in different ways, the tax consequences of conducting your business through a partnership, a company or any other form that you care to think of
default 
defaultwill be a relevant consideration
default.  I spent some time in 
defaultAustralia
default last year researching the fact that a lot of their small business entities are conducted through business trusts, rather than partnerships.  There are tax reasons why that has developed in 
defaultAustralia
default as compared to here, where business trusts are generally not found to any great extent.  So tax plays a part, and that is purely a factor of dealing with each of these entities in a different way and therefore giving rise to different tax considerations.
defaultOf course, a lot of structures are put together, whether as companies or as partnerships or trusts or whatever, specifically for tax reasons, because they generate a tax advantage.  However, I do not think we should allow ourselves to be driven by that factor alone.  
defaultChris Sanger:default That is absolutely right.  
defaultThe normal 
defaultcontext 
defaultfor 
defaultthat type of question is companies wanting to come to the UK and how much tax drives those kinds of decisions, and it is a fair appraisal that the commercial decision is the first thing that matters.  Particularly in a partnership, one of the key questions will be about the partnership ethos, what the partnership set out to do and the driving of the partnership on that basis
default. T
defaulthen you get on to the ques
defaulttion of the overall structure.
defaultOn the company side, when we see companies coming to the 
defaultUK
default, tax is normally sixth or seventh on the agenda over decision
default&#x2011;
defaultmaking, but we tend to get to a decision quite quickly where tax might be one of the motivating factors in a choice between two forms.  I do think commercial is the primary part, but then you will find tax decisions taken into account
default 
defaultat the margin
default.  
defaultProfessor Freedman:default At the small business end, the incentive is almost always to incorporate because of the rate structures at the moment, but for larger firms there are advantages to remaining as partnerships.  There are capital gains tax advantages, there are tax advantages to remaining as partnerships
default,
default and the big advantage is, of course, reduced 
defaultnational insurance
default.  At the time LLPs were introduced, I kept asking everybody why these fi
defaultrms could not just incorporate. Y
defaultou could easily have changed the regulations to allow that.  I was told all the time that this was because they wanted to retain the partnership ethos.  John
default&#xa0;
defaultLewis
default&#xa0;
defaultPartnership is a company that manages to retain, apparently, the partnership ethos, so I was not wholly sold on that explanation, and I think that the 
defaultnational insurance
default explanation was not insignificant.  I think there was a tax reason for those large firms wanting the LLP legislation to be introduced, as it was, but nobody ever admitted that to me.  
defaultLord Bilimoriadefault:default Following that, in 2002, Professor Freedman, you wrote about large professional partnership pressing for LLPs—this is what you are saying—just for tax reasons.
defaultProfessor Freedman:default 
defaultThat 
defaultis what I am saying.  It was not purely for tax reasons, but I do think that there was a tax element in that pressure.
defaultLord Bilimoriadefault:default You think in the light of subsequent events 
defaultthat 
defaultthis has—
defaultProfessor Freedman:default I am not surprised by the fact that that has then led to avoidance 
defaulto
defaultpportunities.  It was fairly predictable and certain steps were taken to close the avoidance opportunities,
default but clearly not quite enough.
defaultLord Bilimoriadefault:default If I may just pursue this, there has been a huge growth of LLPs since they were created.  Do you have any insight as to whether this has been for commercial reasons or tax
default&#x2011;
defaultmotivated, in spite of what you have just said?  Can you say that there are clearly bona fide commercial reasons, as distinguished from tax reasons, for forming an LLP?  
defaultChris Sanger:default There are 
defaultclearly 
defaultbona fide commercial reasons for forming an LLP.  
defaultT
defaulthe numbers that have been presented by the OTS show quite a large amount.  The fact that under the LLP 
defaultc
defaultode, as will be amended, there is the presumption automatically that a member is treated as self
default&#x2011;
defaultemployed, rather than applying what has always been the case for normal partnerships or general partnerships—that you apply the partnership tests as to whether someone really is a partner or a member—will have created the incentive for many people to move into LLPs.  John
default&#xa0;
defaultWhiting, in his previous evidence to this Committee, I think said there were 20,000
default&#xa0;
defaultpartners who were fruit pickers.  That is clearly a case where I would question whether they were all true partners in the context of a general partnership test in any event.  
defaultMalcolm Gammie:default My recollection is that one factor behind the introduction of the LLP legislation was the availability of equivalent legal forms in other jurisdictions.  I seem to recall that it was thought at least that if the 
defaultUnited
default&#xa0;
defaultKingdom
default did not have an equivalent legal framework, certain entities would use a 
defaultChannel Islands
default entity as a way of achieving their objectives.  Now that, of course, was not necessarily a tax objective, but 
defaultit 
defaultwas also providing a framework in which there was limited liability
default and 
defaultnevertheless 
defaultwas 
defaulta partnership form of organisation or relationship between those participating.  However, every time you create a new entity you create new opportunities that you do not necessarily anticipate, just as Professor
default&#xa0;
defaultFreedman has said.  In this respect, we cannot overlook the fact that many jurisdictions have many different forms of entity, and it is increasingly easy to adopt entities in other jurisdictions, even if you are operating in the 
defaultUnited
default&#xa0;
defaultKingdom
default. 
defaultProfessor Freedman:default That is right.  There was litigation at the time, and it did look as though some firms might go to 
defaultJersey
default, and that meant that the legislation was introduced in a bit of a hurry. 
defaultQ22 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Bilimoriadefault:default It has been suggested that HMRC themselves think that partnerships are set up largely for 
defaultthe 
defaultavoidance of tax.  To what extent are HMRC justified in taking this view?
defaultProfessor Freedman:default Once you have set 
defaultup 
defaultthe structure in this way, it is perfectly rational and reasonable to use the structure.  If the LLP is available and is taxed in a certain way, I see no reason why it should be described as avoidance to use it in that way.  There are clearly many businesses that are using the LLP form in a perfectly rational and reasonable way, but there probably are some other businesses that are taking advantage of the fact that 
defaultthe legislation has some gaps. 
defaultChris Sanger:default In addition, and again the OTS report brings this quite starkly to mind, we have seen the creation of City LLPs, which provides an opportunity for the City for a product that they did not have beforehand
default, s
defaulto some of that might well just be market movement and identification of a use for something that no one originally thought of in the first place.  
defaultMalcolm Gammie:default There is no bright line, in many respects, between LLPs, partnerships, ordinary partnerships, companies and so on.  Within large organisations you can have a combination of all these different entities to create different structures.  You can have a limited liability partnership whose members may all be corporates, maybe a mixture of individuals and corporates.  They may be ordinary limited partnerships under the 1907
default&#xa0;
defaultAct and so on.  It is just that people will use the variety of organisational structures that are available to them, for purely commercial reasons, to fit the business model that they want to achieve in the particular circumstances, but so long as there are tax differences in their treatment they will also exploit them for the differences of tax that are involved in those entities.
defaultLord Wakehamdefault:default I am interested in what you sa
defaulty, but years ago when I was in g
defaultovernment I remember receiving lots of representations from big City firms and others
default who
default 
defaultwanted some form of limited liability because they were worried about the damages that they had to pay in negligence claims and one thing and another.  That was the driving force that they came with, whether that was right or not and whether that is balanced, but it was part of the argument.  It seems to me that they have that with their limi
defaultted partnerships, which they did 
defaultnot 
defaulthave
default, and their tax system, if they are efficient
default and 
defaultwork it in the way the Inland Revenue now does not want, got them the lower rates of tax, which retained profits wanted.  I just wondered to what extent there was a commercial reason for also wanting limited partnerships, which perhaps is significant. 
defaultChris Sanger:default I was going to endorse that approach.  The limitation of liability was, of course, very much at the heart of the debate in relation to the Andersen collapse as an accountancy firm
default in 2000
default.  From the professional partnerships’ perspective, that is very much a motivation towards the LLP structure.  
defaultProfessor Freedman:default But they could have achieved that by incorporating.  
defaultLord Wakehamdefault:default Yes, except 
defaultthat 
defaultif you were a professional firm, were you allowed to trade as a limited company?  I do not know if you were.
defaultProfessor Freedman:default That could easily have been changed by regulations.  They control their own regulations.  It is clearly relevant, but it is not the whole—
defaultLord Wakehamdefault:default I was only asking if it was relevant.  
defaultProfessor Freedman:default Subsequently, it did not quite go far enough to give them the limited liability they wanted, so they had to get further changes to the Companies Act
default. S
defaulto
default it is only part of the story. 
defaultQ23 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Leigh of Hurley:default 
defaultI declare the interests I mentioned at the first hearing.  Without labouring Lord
default&#xa0;
defaultBilimoria’s point, the point of interest is 
defaultthat 
defaultProfessor
default&#xa0;
defaultFreedman identifies certain, probably professional, firms that have a partnership ethos that want to carry on that ethos, which one understands.  However, where one has either a new firm or 
defaulta 
defaultbusiness starting up or a venture that has grown to a point where they come to you for tax advice, which presumably at a certain size they do, 
defaultwhich structure 
defaultwould you 
defaulttell 
defaultthem 
defaultwas 
defaultthe most tax
default&#x2011;
defaultefficient for a business to run in?
defaultChris Sanger:default The first thing is that that is quite a complex decision.  
defaultW
defaultith the changes in corporate tax
default recently
default, we have seen the corporate tax rate drop
default. F
defaultr
defaultom next year it will be at 20%, which 
defaulti
defaultn the G20 is the lowest
default—
defaultequal with 
defaultSaudi
default&#xa0;
defaultArabia
default and 
defaultRussia
default.  In addition, we see from a corporate tax perspective 
defaultthat 
defaultyou have access to research and development tax credits.  There are a number of other items where the corporate tax items are different, so you would need to go through and properly evaluate what the overall return was going to be.  You would also need to look at the commercial objectives of the organisation.  One of the benefits of partnership is 
defaultthat 
defaultyou can reward those at the top who are really driving the success of the business, and partnership share is a very important way of doing that, whereas in the corporate space you have the ability to go out for more debt.  If you are expanding into a business that needs capital
default—
defaultif you have capital requirements for
default, say,
default plant and machinery
default—
defaultrather than that which you can gather from the members of a partnership, you would look to go to a corporate vehicle.  Tax is but one of those, and the decision is not always
default clear, which way or the other.
defaultLord Leigh of Hurley:default 
defaultFrom what you are saying, where an organisation need
defaults
default a lot of capital expenditure or 
defaultshows 
defaultcomparable signs of looking like a corporate, where you see that as an LLP 
defaultyou 
defaultwould really have to question why they are an LLP. 
defaultChris Sanger:default There is a challenge.  
defaultUnder 
defaultthe LLP structure, it is not easy to generate capital.  There are ways to do that, and the limited liability part does make that easier, but it was originally designed with professional partnerships in mind.
defaultQ24 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Rowedefault&#x2011;defaultBeddoedefault:default Professor
default&#xa0;
defaultFreedman, when the LLP was introduced in 
default2000, you, I understand, among
default others, predicted that there were avoidance possibilities.  Given the way the legislation was drafted, do you think this ought to have been foreseen or countered by Treasury and HMRC?  
defaultProfessor Freedman:default It is always very easy, with hindsight, to say 
defaultthat 
defaultthings should have been done better, and I do not suppose I could have necessarily done better myself, but it was really the structure and the fact that it was being done in a hurry that worried me.  There were anti
default&#x2011;
defaultavoidance provisions in the original legislation, but there was not very much thought about the 
defaultnational insurance
default aspects and the fact that many people were going to be partners rather than employees. 
defaultChris Sanger:default If you look at the changes that are coming in this Finance Bill, as we look at it specifically, it derives from the fact that you have the presumption of self
default&#x2011;
defaultemployment.  That was something that was clearly at odds to the general partnership and may be one of the key drivers behind the situation we are in today.  
defaultLord Rowedefault&#x2011;defaultBeddoe:default Do you think it was surprising that all members of an LLP would be treated as partners and so self
default&#x2011;
defaultemployed for tax purposes?  Was this the angle that you were concerned about? 
defaultProfessor Freedman:default There was an unhealthy focus on the particular people who were asking for the legislation, which were the large partnerships of professional advisers.  There was not enough thought about how others might use those partnerships and that even the professional advisers might then begin to use it to reduce their tax.  However, mostly it was simply because there was not a wide enough overview of how this vehicle might be used when the legislation was introduced.  
defaultMalcolm Gammie:default Generally speaking, we have significant differences between the way employees and self
default&#x2011;
defaultemployed people are taxed in this country and we have never allowed individuals to elect whether they are going to be taxed as one or the other.  It has always been dependent upon looking at the nature of their employment relationship to determine which they are.  However, one of the facets of the LLP was 
defaultthat 
defaultit was an indirect mechanism by which people could elect which form of taxation the
defaulty were going to be subject to.
defaultChris Sanger:default Your question triggers some thoughts 
defaulton 
defaultthe other part of your inquiry, which we may go on to later today, which 
defaultis 
defaultthe making of tax policy and whether, 
defaultin 
defaultthe current environment, you would have had a greater amount of consultation and a longer period in which to review and identify such concerns. 
defaultLord Rowedefault&#x2011;defaultBeddoe:default You mentioned in earlier evidence 
defaultthe 
default20,000 agricultural workers or fruit pickers or whatever it was.  Obviously, that was not, I assume, what the legislation intended to have.  Do you want to amplify that a 
defaultlittle
default?  There are gangs of agricultural workers that are outside of fruit pickers, but can you tell me a 
defaultlittle
default more about that?
defaultChris Sanger:default I was reflecting, as was said before, on the ethos of partnership
default: that 
defaultbeing 
defaulta partner in a business means 
defaultthat you share in both the upside and the downside, and 
defaultare 
defaultat risk at times of loss or 
defaultat 
defaulttimes when you definitely do not have a guaranteed salary or items like that.  That is one of the key essences of being a partnership.  With the example that the OTS uses and John used last week of that 20,000, you would have to question whether they satisfied that particular test.  
defaultLord Rowedefault&#x2011;defaultBeddoe:default So such a structure really should have been foreseen. 
defaultChris Sanger:default As Judith noted, it is easy to sit here with hindsight and look back at this.  I would like to think that the new focus on tax
default 
defaultpolicy-making
default would give more time for those things to be foreseen and to give the kind of challenge, 
defaultwhich 
defaultwe may come to later.  I still think 
defaultthe 
defaultTreasury needs to enhance its challenge function on tax policy more generally and be able to really think through the impacts.  History has shown us that when we introduce a new tax regime or we make any change, it will be fine for the moment, but we always design tax policy based on the environment 
defaultthat 
defaultwe have today and where we think it is going to be.  Generally, 
defaultthere 
defaultis a different environment two, three or four years later, and that is when our tax rules are tested.  
defaultThe Chairman:default As you say, we will come on to the whole process of consultation and so on.  Just going back to the 20,000-members point, was there an inherent fault in the structure of the original legislation, or should that particular instance, for example, have been challenged? 
defaultChris Sanger:default I personally believe that the presumption that the members of an LLP are automatically self
default&#x2011;
defaultemployed is one of the main causes of the challenge that we have here.  When my firm responded to the consultation that gave rise to the changes in this Finance
default&#xa0;
defaultBill, we said it should go back to the fundamental tests of general partnership applied to an LLP.  At a stroke, that would have dealt with the example of those 20,000
default&#xa0;
defaultpartners or so
default&#x2011;
defaultcalled members of the LLP.
defaultLord Leigh of Hurley:default 
defaultI remember when partnership law restricted it to 20, but that was some time ago.  W
defaulthat do you think would be the result if the Chancellor
default had
default looked at this in a completely different way and
default had just simply said that 
defaultnational insurance
default will be applied to all earned income
default?
defaultChris Sanger:default That would result in a fundamental change to our overall tax system for, effectively, the self
default&#x2011;
defaultemployed, and would have driven up overall tax costs.  You would also have to look at the benefits, because there is a difference between the benefits that are received by those who are self
default&#x2011;
defaultemployed compared to those who are employed.  If I had
default been asked that question while
default sitting inside 
defaultthe 
defaultTreasury, I would have most definitely asked Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs or KAI
default—the 
defaultKnowledge, Analysis 
default&amp;
default Intelligence
default Directorate—
defaultto do an economic analysis to do that, so I will not presume to judge the outcome.
defaultProfessor Freedman:default That is the crucial question and answer
defaults
default many of the problems, 
defaultincluding 
defaultthe problem 
defaultthat 
defaultyour colleagues are looking at on the IR35 Committee: 
defaultthat 
defaultif we could just look at the root of the problem rather than always tackling the symptoms, and if we just had a proper study, as Mirrlees suggested and as the Office of Tax Simplification in its initial report on small businesses suggested, of whether we should in some way bring 
defaultnational insurance
default and tax charges closer together, given that 
defaultnational insurance
default is a tax, that would save an awful lot of trouble in the long run.  However, it is a very big job
default. I
defaultt is not easy to do.
defaultQ25 default&#xa0; 
defaultBaroness Drake:default If I could declare an interest, I am an independent member of the Walker Guidelines Monitoring Group for the private equity industry.
defaultStaying with this issue of employee or partner, and the folly that followed from the presumption of self
default&#x2011;
defaultemployment, the draft legislation still does not impose the general partnership law test to determine whether 
defaultsomeone is a 
defaultpartner or employee, and 
defaultit 
defaulthas these new mechanical economic tests—variable profits, influence over management and capital contribution.  Do you think it would have been simpler and more coherent to stay with or extend the general partnership law tests, and why do you think the Government did not stay with them?
defaultChris Sanger:default We do absolutely believe it would have been simpler to reinforce the tests.  At the moment, assuming these laws go through, we will have one particular treatment for the LLP structures and another treatment for English general partnerships and, indeed, for foreign partnerships, so we will have both rules running side by side.  Generally, we try to avoid having two systems that apply in a similar but slightly different manner.  As I mentioned, our response to the consultation specifically recommended that we reinstated the tests that applied to the English general partnership to the LLP.  HMRC has commented publicly in its response to the consultation that it did not believe that that would provide sufficient clarity because the rules were open for question.  That is an odd response given it has been clarified through the courts in a number of ways and, effectively, we are producing new rules that will have had no testing and will then themselves have to be clarified by the courts or by guidance.  We are potentially ending up again in a slightly unfortunate situation where we have some fairly broad legislation and that clarity 
defaultis 
defaultdelivered not through legislation but through guidance, which is HMRC’s interpretation of the law rather than giving taxpayers the clarity they would expect.  So our recommendation was and remains that it should go back to the tried and tested rules that will still apply for
default English general partnerships. 
defaultMalcolm Gammie:default I am not sure that I would necessarily say it was simpler.  In a sense, the LLP in its current form is simple
default;
default it is just that we do not like the consequences that it produces, given the differences we have between taxing employees and those who are in an ordinary general partnership relationship.  If you have an entity where essentially you have a number of members and you have to try to draw a line between those whom you think are really in a relationship of partnership and those who are just employees, that is not necessarily going to be a simple thing to do, but it is difficult to think of alternative tests if that is the basic structure in which you have your tax system.  
defaultQ26 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Leigh of Hurley:default 
defaultJust looking at the situation where you have partnership with
default mixed membership, t
defaulthe policy seemed to be to try 
defaultto
default stop moving profits between the two
default simply for
default tax.  Does this happen in practice
default and is it for bona fide commercial reasons
default,
default or is it simply to take advantage of the situation for the benefit of reducing the overall tax burden
default? 
defaultMalcolm Gammie:default Speaking for myself, I can say 
defaultthat 
defaultI am aware that there are structures out there that use companies in this way.  I could not possibly say to what extent; it is a matter of general application or whether it meets particular circumstances.  It is obviously one way in which, through an appropriate structure, you can retain amounts within the overall entity and pay tax at the corporate rates
default,
default and there may be perfectly good commercial reasons why you want to achieve that objective, whether related to the funding of the business or related to the way in which the members of the LLP are going to be rewarded.  Of course, from the Revenue’s perspective that look
defaults
default like avoidance to the extent that amounts ultimately accrue to the benefit of the individual members rather than to the corporate entity, which is effectively an intermediate holding structure.  However, we could argue to the end of the day which are avoidance and which are not avoidance; it is just a use of the different forms and entities that we have and the way in which they are taxed.  
defaultLord Leigh of Hurley:default 
defaultIs it
default to try to convert income into capital?  Is that the reason why you set up these structures with corporate membership?
default  
defaultMalcolm Gammie:default It is very difficult to speak in general terms because one does not know.  These are not things that are necessarily the subject of general public knowledge; we are talking about private structures and so on.  Of course, some of them may be used to try to convert income into capital, some may just be being used to get the benefit of the lower corporate tax rate and others might be used for entirely nefarious purposes of putting profits offshore and not taxed at all.  I do not know.  It is just a function of having a variety of different structures taxed in a different way. 
defaultChris Sanger:default The other reason why you might have a corporate structure could well be for asset ownership or for property, where you may want a corporate that can sign leases or other commercial reasons as well, so there are other commercial reasons for why corporates might be useful.  
defaultLord Leigh of Hurley:default 
defaultSo you are saying that they are in addition to tax
default&#x2011;
defaultplanning reasons.  So there are tax
default&#x2011;
defaultplanning reasons why people do this
default:
default to have a mixed structure in some instances pu
defaultrely for tax
default&#x2011;
defaultplanning reasons.
defaultChris Sanger:default There are, in addition, commercial reasons for why there may well be a benefit to having a corporate in the overall structure.
defaultLord Leigh of Hurley:default 
defaultDo you think the proposed legislation will work in stopping the movement of profit around?
defaultChris Sanger:default We are still looking at the draft legislation at the moment
default. It 
defaultis clearly out to consultation until the beginning of February.  It is a complex piece of legislation.  I can see where the Revenue are trying to get to
default. 
defaultI am not quite sure whether they will achieve it as yet.  
defaultProfessor Freedman:default I do not want to add anything to that, but 
defaultmay I return to 
defaultBaroness Drake
default’s
default point about the case law?  It seems to me that one of the problems—and the response of HMRC to the consultation responses shows this—is that they apply the case law in a certain way, looking at certain factors as if they were rigid, whereas in fact the case law is all about looking at the substance, not the form.  So it does not matter that people have holiday pay or not, which is one of the reasons they give for it being problematic, because that is only one small factor in the case law.  If they do not think that this case law is clear enough in the case of partnerships—LLPs—why do they think it is clear enough to use in the case of IR35?  
defaultQ27 default&#xa0; 
defaultBaroness Drake:default Just staying there, perhaps I ought to declare 
defaultthat 
defaultI am a member of the Employment Appeal Tribunal, so I hear some of these cases of whether someone is an employee based on their situation.  Do you think the new test could produce new anomalous results 
defaultfor 
defaultthe status of people? 
defaultProfessor Freedman:default I am sure it will.  There will be a lot more cases.  There will be a difference between the person’s employment status for employment purposes and for tax purposes.  Where should 
defaultnational insurance
default be there?  I do not know.  It will be with the tax, but is that fair?  If you are going to be judged on whether you are an employee or not for the purposes of certain benefits and you are paying 
defaultnational insurance
default as if you are an employee, how will
default that
default impact on you as an employment tribunal member?  I do not know.  Will you take it into account or will you not?  These are all questions 
defaultthat 
defaultwe do not know the answer to and that raise uncertainties. 
defaultBaroness Drake:default Do you think it could lead to some significant LLPs restructuring their partnership agreements in order to build it explicitly around those tests?
defaultProfessor Freedman:default It is clear that they are all having to rethink their partnership agreements and before April as well, because they have set them up under certain rules and now they are all having to re
default&#x2011;
defaultexamine them.  That will not necessarily be about avoidance; it is just about knowing how their people are going to be taxed.  I have no idea what they will do, but they may well try to think of new ways of structuring.  
defaultMalcolm Gammie:default I would endorse what Professor
default&#xa0;
defaultFreedman has said.  Experience tells you that all these changes merely shift the ground on which the argument takes place, because you are not addressing the fundamental problem that underlies all this
default,
default an
defaultd that is part of the problem.
defaultTo pick up the final point that was made by Lord
default&#xa0;
defaultLeigh, even if
default 
defaultthe change in the rules for mixed partnerships
default is successful, 
defaultthere will inevitably still be attempts to structure on the basis of the new rules.  However, the balance that you are always trying to achieve in this area is between stopping what you do not like at the moment—and it is not always easy to see what is or is not liked at a particular moment—without inhibiting genuine commercial structures for which there is a commercial need to adopt maybe a partnership form or a mixed partnership form.  It is that very difficult balance between not inhibiting the commercial but stopping what you do not like that is the balance that is sought 
defaultto be achieved.
defaultLord Bilimoria:default Can we just pursue this?  Is there not an unintended consequence in that you can have a member of an LLP also being treated as an employee under the wording of the 2000
default&#xa0;
defaultAct?  How do you explain 
defaultthe fact t
defaulthat you can have somebody who is a partner and also be—I think it is 
defaultin 
defaultS
defaultection
default&#xa0;
default(4)
default?
defaultMalcolm Gammie:default The question is to what extent that provision of the LLP Act 2000 has effect for tax purposes, given the specific deeming that there is for tax purposes that a member of the LLP is a partner for tax purposes.  There is a tension between what the general law in the LLP Act says and what the deeming for tax purposes is, whic
defaulth you have drawn attention to. 
defaultBaroness Drake:default This issue of the test for distinguishing partner from employee has obviously excited quite a few people.  How do you feel that that particular issue was dealt with under the new approach to taxation policy and consultation in particular?  Do you think it was fairly thorough or do you think that was a particular provision in the proposals that could have been iterated more thoroughly? 
defaultChris Sanger:default Reading the response to 
defaultthe 
defaultconsultation, one of the key challenges in 
defaultthe 
defaultconsultation to date has been that you do not understand why 
defaultthe G
defaultovernment 
defaulthave
default taken the decision 
defaultthey have
default.  They have three sentences that basically dismiss the idea that you should apply the rules that apply to general partnerships to the LLP, and it is a good challenge to ask them to explain why, because it seem
defaults
default that we had a test that worked
default,
default that has stood the test of time and that has been overwritten by error almost, if you like, in relation to the original changes.  I do not think that the explanation given to date makes it v
defaultery clear why the Government have
default decided to go down a set of independent rules. 
defaultThe Chairman:default That almost brings us on to the question of the approach to consultation and so on, but just before we do that, are there any other points that you would like to make on what we have been discussing so far?   
defaultBaroness Wheatcroft:default If I may, I would like to ask you all, from your own experience, how many partners you think an LLP can genuinely have and function as a partnership
default.
default  
defaultIt is o
defaultbviously not 20,000.
defaultChris Sanger:default It is a very good question.  If one goes down to the nature of the ethos of partnership, in the past you probably had a small number, because it is quite difficult to get people together to think through and agree things as a partnership.  I attended a partners’ meeting this morning, which was held via webca
defaultst and same
default&#x2011;
defaulttime communication, 
defaultwith questions back and forth, looking at where our results were and all those items.  
defaultThat was a
defaultbsolutely a true engagement of partnership with real challenge to the questions of what we are doing, where we are investing, how we see the market—
defaultall
default that kind of approach.  It is difficult to look at the numbers, and there are extremes.  We are a partnership of just over 500
default&#xa0;
defaultpartners.  One of the things that attracted me to where I am now at EY was that partnership ethos of being there
default and 
defaultdriving the business forward with a group of like
default&#x2011;
defaultminded and somewhat challenging partners who will keep your mind active.  The high numbers 
defaultare 
defaultnot a test on 
defaulttheir 
defaultown; it is about the whole ethos and the way 
defaultthe
default partnership works.
defaultProfessor Freedman:default I do not really understand why the legal form has to dictate the institutional arrangements.  That description of a partners’ meeting sounded a bit like a description of a shareholders’ meeting or, indeed, a meeting at a university.  You can have all sorts of different institutional arrangements and still have engagement, so I am not convinced, but I have never been a partner
default,
default so perhaps that is why. 
defaultThe Chairmandefault:default If there are no other points that you would like to make on what we have been discussing so far, perhaps we could move on to the new approach to tax
default 
defaultpolicy
default-
defaultmaking.  
defaultQ28 default&#xa0; 
defaultBaroness Wheatcroft:default This stems from Baroness
default&#xa0;
defaultDrake’s question really.  The conversation this afternoon has shown that the policy-making in this instance was not ideal, but I know that you, Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultGammie and Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultSanger, have been involved in the organisation looking at the making of tax policy and reporting on how effectively the new approach is working.  Your first report I think was more sanguine than the second.  I wonder if you could bring us up to date with your latest thinking on this.  
defaultMalcolm Gammie:default The important aspect of the Tax Professionals Forum is that it is designed to focus on the process rather than the substance of the policy.  Of course, at meetings there is a huge temptation to want to discuss the policy that has been adopted, but that is not really the function of the 
defaultf
defaultorum and, from my perspective, I see that as a very important aspect of it.  Partnerships
default are 
defaulta very good illustration of this tension between what one might describe as good policy and the responses in 
defaultthe form 
defaultof good policy and the process by which 
defaultthe 
defaultGovernment, for whatever reason, 
defaulthave 
defaulttaken particular policy decisions and by what process 
defaultthey 
defaultshould press them forward.  In many respects, it seems to me that the mechanisms and processes by which 
defaultthe Government consult on the policy and push
default it forward to legislation have been working fairly well under the new arrangements, but of course that still leaves large question marks over whether it is the right policy or indeed, for example in the partnership area, whether it is addressing the right question.  
defaultChris Sanger:default I am not sure I recognise the 
defaultpoint 
defaultthat our second report was less positive than the first.  They slightly focused on different items.  The first 
defaultlooked
default at the whole part of the tax policy and new approach and the way it was working, and the second looked in more detail.  In addition, with the second, we had had the protocol in relation to immediate announcements of tax policy, which we looked at.  
defaultBefore coming to this Committee I re
default&#x2011;
defaultread our two reports, and it was interesting to see that each of those reports had both good things and less good examples of engagement on tax policy.  
defaultIn the 
default2011 one, we had things like the CFC as an example of really positive engagement throughout the process, and I may come back to that process in a moment.  Then we had some problematic ones in relation to things like disguised remuneration, which I know this Committee itself looked at in relation to the 2011 one.  There were some good and less good examples, and the same was true in relation to the 2012 ones.  
defaultOn things like, again,
default the CFC, the statutory residence, 
defaultthe 
defaultnon
default&#x2011;
defaultdom examples
default, 
defaultthe proposals were put through all five tests.  Nonetheless we had, dare I say, the pasty tax and other challenges in that one, so I think they both showed that the process is working.  
defaultIn 
defaultTax 
defaultPolicy-making
default: 
defaultA New Approach
default, there is much more formality around how we go forward with tax policy
default. T
defaulthat provides a real opportunity for many more people to be engaged in the debate
default,
default and that is absolutely to the good.  There will always be examples, but the fact that I am citing examples of where it has dropped means that they are, almost by definition, the exception.  We are moving to a world where good policy
default&#x2011;
defaultmaking and good communication of that policy 
defaultare 
defaultbecoming the norm, and that is a good result.  I hope that when we come to the 2013 review, which will be out shortly, we will find 
defaultthat 
defaultwe are in the same position.  There are clearly some good examples and there are clearly some less good examples.  As Malcolm said, 
defaultand 
defaultspeaking in a personal capacity, one of 
defaultmy 
defaultconcerns 
defaultwould 
defaultbe the 
defaultfour-week 
defaultconsultation on tax and procurement that 
defaultwent
default right up to a very hard deadline.  That 
defaultis 
defaultclearly 
defaultless 
defaultgood for this forthcoming report, but I will 
defaultdiscuss
default it with our fellow members.  
defaultBaroness Wheatcroft:default Would it be your theory that it 
defaulttends to work
default less well when there is a wish to do something quickly?  
defaultChris Sanger:default When you are pushing something through very
default quickly and you have less time 
defaultto think, it clearly leaves you more exposed to lapses in the policy-making.  It is worth reflecting on what drove the creation of the 
defaultf
defaultorum.  The tax
default 
defaultpolicy-making approach listed five areas of concern that set up the creation of 
defaultthe forum
default and the overall approach.  If I may list them, there was the lack of a clear strategy for the tax system; consulting too late in the policy development cycle; the length and complexity of the tax code; uncertainty due to the volume and timing 
defaultof tax changes; and inadequate p
defaultarliamentary scrutiny of tax legislation.  If I reflect on where that takes us in terms of 
defaulttax policy-making
default, we have seen some clear strategy in relation to the tax system as a whole.  When I spoke to this Committee previously, we spoke about the 
defaultcorporate tax road map 
defaultproviding a strategy of where the corporate tax system would go.  That has been a good
default outcome of the policy approach:
default engaging with business and with interested parties about where the system would be.  
defaultFrom personal reflection, I would like to see that developed further.  Rather than a corporate tax 
defaultroad map
default, picking up 
defaulton 
defaultwhat Judith mentioned as well, maybe 
defaultthere should be 
defaulta business tax road map and a personal tax road map—something that gave you t
defaulthat kind of focus on strategy.
defaultThe reports show that the second part, consulting late in the policy development cycle, has been improved.  As I already mentioned, there are a number of places where, to my mind, there have been lapses, but there is definitely improvement.  
defaultThe length and complexity of the tax code is probably more a question for John
default&#xa0;
defaultWhiting with his OTS hat on.  I do not think we have seen much, if any, improvement of that; the pile of my books on legislation just grows ever higher.
defaultOn the u
defaultncertainty due to the volume and timing of tax changes
default, 
defaultit is very pleasant to know 
defaultsufficiently in advance 
defaultwhen the Budget is going to be and to be able to see 
defaultsome level of certainty there.
defaultFinally, 
defaulton 
defaultthe last point about increased 
defaultparliamentary
default scrutiny of tax legislation
default, C
defaultommittees like you here and elsewhere have definitely improved the overall focus.  
defaultTo reflect back to the question, I do think we are seeing some posit
defaultive moves forward on tax policy-
defaultmaking.
defaultBaroness Wheatcroft:default Thank you very much.  Professor
default&#xa0;
defaultFreedman, do you have anything to add to that?
defaultProfessor Freedman:default Yes.  I am not in 
defaultthe forum
default, but there is masses of consultation and that is all very well, but sometimes I am not sure that HMRC and 
defaultthe 
defaultTreasury know quite what to do with it.  Unless you go out consulting with some clear background knowledge so that you can evaluate what is coming back, there is a danger that you lose your way.  I am not saying that this is necessarily deliberate lobbying
default. I
defaultt might be, but it might just be 
defaultthat 
defaulttechnical points 
defaultare 
defaultbeing made that are then put into the legislation—I have seen examples of this—where they do not really fit, because the people who have received the responses think it must be a good point if it has come from clever people but they do not really see where it fits.  That can mess up the legislation quite badly, so there needs to be quite a lot of knowledge in order to evaluate the consultations, and so a road map would be helpful.  However, you also need quite detailed knowledge, and sometimes the people working on the consultations, who are all very, very bright, have just not had long enough in the area to know about that detail and so mistakes are made that way.  
defaultThe other thing I would say is that we are also still not very good at looking at these tax
default 
defaultpolicy changes in a wider context and in a holistic context.  We are not looking at benefits legislation at the same time as we are looking at tax
default. W
defaulte are not looking at employment law
default. W
defaulte are not looking at partnership law when we are changing partnerships.  There is not enough joined-up 
defaultg
defaultovernment here, so that can cause problems
default. One 
defaultof the problems with this partnership legislation was that it was being led by DTI, as it then was, and perhaps there was not enough input from HMRC.  
defaultBaroness Wheatcroft:default The silo approach. 
defaultProfessor Freedman: defaultYes.  
defaultBaroness Wheatcroft:default Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultGammie, do you have anything to add? 
defaultMalcolm Gammie:default No, I think Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultSanger has dealt fairly comprehensively with what I would say on the matter.
defaultQ29 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultSanger, you mentioned the pasty tax.  There will always be little bits of the Finance Bill that 
defaultdeal
default with what are seen as particular problems or particular opportunities or for political reasons
default. T
defaulthere will always be those sorts of things.  You would draw a distinction between that, including some that we used to call “lollipops”, and the wider tax structural changes and so on for which the consultation process was really meant.  You are not suggesting that every small tax change should be subject to consultation.  
defaultChris Sanger:default No, I am not suggesting that every small tax should be subject to consultation.  However, there is a fundamental challenge when you make any change to the tax system, because it will necessarily change the environment
default,
default and tax motivate
defaults
default behaviour at the margin, so it is sensible to review.  Sometimes it is dangerous to proceed with policy changes unless they have been consulted on, because having that knowledge about how the tax system applies in practice is really important.  
defaultI would 
defaultlook at the way 
defaultthe 
defaultTreasury and HMRC are structured right now
default. W
defaulte used to have an environment where
default 
defaultthe Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise, in those days, owned tax policy changes and the role of Her Majesty’s Treasury was to have that strategic view and to challenge the outcome of Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise.  If 
defaultthe 
defaultTreasury 
defaultw
defaultanted to implement a particular change, 
defaultit 
defaultwould ask the Inland Revenue experts and the Customs and Excise experts to design the change
default,
default and then 
defaultit 
defaultwould engage in discussion and challenge what that change was going to be.  
defaultI am not sure whether the so
default&#x2011;
defaultcalled pasty tax is an example of this, but there is a danger in the current system that 
defaultthe 
defaultTreasury has taken on board quite a lot of the people from HMRC, and they now have a kind of policy origination function as well as 
defaultthe function 
defaultthey used to have in 
defaultrelation to 
defaultpolicy strategy and policy challenge.  There is a danger that with a policy originated inside HM
default&#xa0;
defaultTreasury it may not get to, if you like, the depths and the specialists within HMRC who might well be able to say, “In practice, that is not going to work in my esoteric part of the tax system”.
default I
defaultf policies were more owned at the HMRC level, you might find that some of the idiosyncrasies of the tax system that would just 
defaultbe 
defaultlost on policy officials sitting in HM
default&#xa0;
defaultTreasury, however hard they were to try, would be picked up and 
defaultperhaps 
defaultdealt with before 
defaultthey were 
defaultreleased in draft legislation or consultation.
defaultQ30 default&#xa0; 
defaultBaroness Blackstone:default The 2011 report of this 
defaults
defaultub
default&#x2011;
defaultc
defaultommittee recommended that the Government should commit 
defaultthemselves 
defaultto post
default&#x2011;
defaultimplementation reviews, which would be independent, when large tax changes had taken place.  The recommendation was not taken up by 
defaultg
defaultovernment
default. 
defaultI do not think any of us were on the Committee at the time.  I wonder whether you could tell us to what extent the Government’s existing monitoring and evaluation arrangements meet the objectives and standards of independent review.  
defaultMalcolm Gammie:default By definition, they cannot be independent in the sense that 
defaultthe implementation 
defaultis being done by people who may be principally responsible for their operational implementation and who will have a particular perspective of provisions.  In that sense, I would have said that there was still considerable scope for a much greater degree of independent standing back and looking at what we have.  
defaultJust to pick up the five headings that Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultSanger referred to in relation to the policy objectives, as he notes it would be very difficult to say 
defaultthat 
defaultwe have had much success in limiting the scale of legislation that is introduced and the sheer scale and complexity of that legislation, but it is very difficult to assess that anybody at any officially recognised level stands back and reviews that.  One assumes that reviews occur within the Treasury and the Revenue, and it may be that they can 
defaultcome and 
defaultspeak to this Committee in a bit more detail about what they do, but I would suspect that they come at a lot of these issues with a rather more limited eye than I certainly would think desirable in trying to tackle some of the ongoing problems of the tax system.  
defaultBaroness Blackstone:default Is it the intention of the Tax Professionals Forum to take on post
default&#x2011;
defaultimplementation reviews of this kind?  
defaultMalcolm Gammie:default I do not think that is in our remit.  
defaultThe extent to which this might be done 
defaultis obviously an aspect of the discussion that has occ
defaulturred at some of the meetings, 
defaultbut I do not think it is one of our specific remits.  In some ways, it does not have to be done at an official level.  The Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Tax Law Review Committee, to an extent, can and do take on this sort of role, but inevitably external reviews of that sort may have less impact than if you had something within the institutional framework to see that it is done.
defaultBaroness Blackstone:default You are not arguing for your remit being changed so that you could encompass this sort of work. 
defaultMalcolm Gammie:default I do not think I would necessarily be against a change in the remit so that it included that, but you have to recollect that we are a voluntary body dealing with these things.  Generally speaking, given the scale of the consultation that Professor
default&#xa0;
defaultFreedman has referred to, we have our work cut out just monitoring what is going on let alone standing back and reviewing what 
defaultwas
default put in place a few years ago.  
defaultChris Sanger:default It 
defaultmay be 
defaultworth reflecting that the Treasury’s own 
defaultGreen Book
default, 
defaultAppraisal and Evaluation in Central Government
default, suggest
defaults
default that all policy-
defaultmaking that it imposes or requests of other 
defaultgovernment departments 
defaultfollows the so
default&#x2011;
defaultcalled ROAMEF approach
default: 
defaultrational, objectives, appraisal, monitoring
default, 
defaultand 
default“EF”
default—
defaultevaluation and feedback.  So I think it is perfectly right that others should be looking to Treasury to follow its own advice in relation to the “EF” of ROAMEF.
defaultBaroness Blackstone:default What has happened since the 2011 
defaultsub
default&#x2011;
defaultcommittee’s 
defaultreport does not lead any of you to believe that there is no issue here
default.
default  There is an issue and it is something 
defaultwhich 
defaultthe Committee ought to pursue.  Would I be right in concluding that from what you have said? 
defaultChris Sanger:default As Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultGammie said, there is little evidence to the outside world of those reviews being undertaken.  
defaultThey 
defaultmay be happening inside 
defaultthe 
defaultTreasury and HMRC, but it would be good 
defaultfor 
defaultthe outcome of that 
defaultto be far more visible
default.  Indeed, 
defaultgoing 
defaultback from this Committee to the Tax Professionals Forum, our role is, as Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultGammie set out, to look at the way policy is made and those last parts will encourage us to engage further on the “EF”.  
defaultBaroness Blackstone:default If they are doing these reviews, are you implying that they really ought to be published so that they 
defaultcan be more widely scrutinised?
defaultChris Sanger:default There will be some things in relation to the reviews that may need to be confidential, because they may need access to taxpayer information, but there should be a natural part of reviewing the outcome of legislation and that can only be to the good. 
defaultThe Chairman:default You can be sure that these are questions that we will be asking of HMRC and 
defaultthe 
defaultTreasury when they come in front of us as part of this inquiry.  
defaultQ31 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Wakeham:default In your last few answers, you have answered most of the points that I was going to ask in my question, so my question is pretty simple: do you think 
defaultthat 
defaultthe proposals for changes in the partnership legislation live up to the high standards that you think have been achieved in the past and are intended in the new policy? 
defaultMalcolm Gammie:default Do you mean in the way in which they have been implemented? 
defaultLord Wakeham:default The way they have been discussed and promoted.
defaultMalcolm Gammie:default The consultation process is obviously continuing.  There are elements of it that have not necessarily quite 
defaultcome up 
defaultto the standard that one would hope to have seen, but we are in an ongoing process, so perhaps one should reserve final judgement on that until we see what the final product is.  
defaultThe Chairman:default That sounds a very tactful answer, if I may say so.  Can I thank all three of you very much indeed for yet again giving us the benefit of your experience and views?  You are very welcome to stay on for the next witnesses if you wish to do so, but thank you, because you have also raised points that we will be raising later in other sessions, for example, with HMRC and 
defaultthe 
defaultTreasury.  Thank you very much.
