More detail is needed on how much it costs to call using different networks.• Communications should be in plain English. More work is needed to revise how changes to products can be more easily communicated whilst remaining within the guidelines from the financial regulator.• Product offerings should be presented in a way that helps consumers compare the full range of services and know that they can switch.• The complaints process should be available from all points of contact, verbal complaints logged and actioned and leaflets available in branch displays.• A review of packaged accounts, eligibility processes and usage of individual services is needed.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Switching bank account&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;People in Northern Ireland have told us they use branches of banks quite regularly.

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Previously the Financial Services Authority (FSA) supervision policy allowed for increased scrutiny of the largest firms with the largest number of customers across the UK. This meant that not all banks operating in NI were receiving the same robust and persistent supervision.   We are expecting to see a more detailed level of testing extended to NI now that FCA has taken up its new role.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
