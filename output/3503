&#xa0;[bold]Written evidence submitted by[bold] Ricardo UK Ltd[bold] (GHS0016)[bold]Ricardo is a leading independent provider of innovative technology, engineering services and strategic consulting to the world’s automotive, transport and energy industries.    
[normal]Ricardo was the Project Coordinator for the European Commission project Safe Ro
[normal]ad Trains for the Environment (SARTRE).   This EU FP7 research project delivered a prototype vehicle platoon system using two heavy goods vehicles and three passenger cars, with one of the trucks leading the convoy.  
[normal]Ricardo is also the leader of a consor
[normal]tium including TRL which won a recent Department for Transport tender on a Feasibility Study for Heavy Vehicle Platoons on UK Roads.  This feasibility study will also include a technology review and the development of a work specification for roads trials 
[normal]of HGV platooning on UK motorways.

[normal]What are (or were) the policy challenges presented by this technology? 
[normal]Levels of automation
[normal]The term “autonomous vehicle” covers a wide range of automated vehicle technologies ranging from automated parking to a fully a
[normal]utonomous vehicle operating under all conditions and not requiring any (short-term) human intervention.  A number of organisations, 
[normal]BASt (Bundesanstalt für Straßenwesen) in Germany and 
[normal]NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Adminstration) in the USA, have 
[normal]already started to classify these technologies and define the different levels of vehicle automation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]L
[normal]evels of
[normal] automation need to be defined
[normal] to create an agreed EU-wide set of definitions.  
[normal]T
[normal]hese definitions will help to frame 
[normal]all subsequent 
[normal]policies
[normal] on 
[normal]automated vehicles
[normal].
[normal]Liability
[normal]At present, liability rests with the (human) driver.  With an automated vehicle, liability could rest with the vehicle owner / keeper, the vehicle driver / operator, the manufacturer, the driver of another vehicle (e.g. in pla
[normal]tooning system)
[normal], etc
[normal].  Regulations 
[normal]to define
[normal] the responsibilities 
[normal]of the different parties 
[normal]are required.
[normal]L
[normal]GV Driver’s Hours
[normal]The driving and working hours of commercial vehicle
[normal] driver
[normal]s is highly regulated.  If a L
[normal]GV driver is part of an automated platoon, and is not required to actively control the vehicle, the regulations need to be updated to clarify how this time should be classified.  
[normal]This could potentially extend the 
[normal]4.5+4.5 hour 
[normal]daily 
[normal]limit and therefore incr
[normal]ease the daily 
[normal]range of the vehicle.  
[normal]At present, in the case of multi-manning where there are several drivers in the vehicle, the non-driving driver’s time is not considered as “driving” but 
[normal]is 
[normal]considered as either “rest” or “POA (Period Of Availability)”
[normal].
[normal]The physical, legislative and interface requirements on how the platooning system should work with the tachograph need to be defined to enforce the safe and legal operation of the 
[normal]vehicles
[normal].
[normal]  The operational aspects of platooning such as enforcement, effe
[normal]cts on driver of leading a platoon, etc. need to be investigated.
[normal]Legislation
[normal]Current legislation is based on the 1968 Vienna Convention and the “
[normal]driver shall at all times be able to control his vehicle
[normal]”.  For automated vehicle technology to be introduced 
[normal]to the market, the legislation must be updated to cater for different levels of drivers being “in the loop”
[normal], recognising that different rules may apply for the range of levels of automation
[normal].
[normal]In the first instance, the regulations to allow approved organis
[normal]ations to develop and test their prototype systems on public roads is required.  Although 
[normal]development and 
[normal]testing will start on private test tracks, tests in real-world environments on public roads is essential to develop mature, robust systems
[normal] that are su
[normal]itable for commercial introduction
[normal].
[normal]At a later date, regulations for commercial introduction of such technologies are required.
[normal]Overview of SARTRE project
[normal] – “Safe Road Trains for the Environment”
[normal]The SARTRE project is a European Union FP7 project which d
[normal]evelops strategies and technologies to allow vehicle platoons to operate on normal public highways with significant environmental, safety and comfort benefits.  The basic assumptions are that SARTRE platoons will operate on public highways, shared with oth
[normal]er non-platoon traffic, and that no changes to the road infrastructure will be required.
[normal]The project was led by Ricardo and has brought together the skills and expertise of 7 partners from 4 countries: Applus+ IDIADA, Institut für Kraftfahrzeuge Aachen (ik
[normal]a), Ricardo, SP Technical Research Institute of Sweden, Tecnalia, Volvo Cars, Volvo Technology.
[normal]The overall concept of SARTRE is to have a group of vehicles driving together with a lead vehicle, driven normally by a trained professional driver, and several
[normal] following vehicles driven fully automatically by the system with small longitudinal gaps between them.  Driving in this way in a platoon brings benefits in fuel consumption, safety and driver convenience.  
[normal]The demonstration system has been successfully t
[normal]ested on test tracks and public motorways, and demonstrated to industry stakeholders as well as members of the press.  Using these vehicles, the fuel consumption benefits of platooning have been measured, showing gains of up to 16% for the following vehicl
[normal]es and 8% for the lead vehicle.
[normal]Although there remain technical and regulatory challenges before a commercial implementation of SARTRE can be available, the project has successfully demonstrated platooning technology based to a large extent on existing 
[normal]technologies which can be implemented on existing highways without any additions to the road infrastructure.
