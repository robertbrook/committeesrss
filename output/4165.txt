[[[he role for the licence fee in a digital media era ]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“[The BBC is] currently estimated to have around 70 per cent of all news consumption on both television and radio… The problem is when the BBC’s editorial voice speaks too much as one to the exclusion of others… Coordination [of news output] can lead to homogeneity; and that can be intensified by regulation that sees there being ‘right and ‘wrong’ answers”.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“A properly resourced service independent of the BBC could provide bracing competition and increase choice for audiences. There may be other ideas across all media that should be given a go too”.&#xa0;&#xa0;“The hard question for the corporation is why in a digital age it should have the whole pie to itself forever – when doing something different might be better for the public good”.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0; Ofcom Communications Market Report 2013, figure 2.36 and 2.37  BBC audience research available at http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/consult/purpose_remits/audience_research.pdf  BBC Trust service licence reviews of BBC One, Two and Four in 2010 research showed the gap between the audience expectation about and the reality of distinctive programming as being  -16 (for BBC One),  – 15 (for BBC Two) and  -8 (BBC Four). NB BBC Three was not reviewed as part of this assessment. http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/regulatory_framework/service_licences/service_reviews/one_two_four/tv_services_interim.pdf Subsequent research commissioned for the BBC Trust showed continuing disparity http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/review_report_research/ara2011_12/distinctiveness.pdf

[[[BBC Trust review of BBC One and BBC Two service licences]]] (2010): “The clearest message audiences are sending us is that they want a more distinctive BBC One and BBC Two. The most significant gap between audience expectations and actual performance of BBC One and BBC Two arises in relation to their provision of programmes which ‘have lots of fresh and new ideas’.” -&#xa0;&#xa0; “We believe BBC management should look to increase the variety and range of pre-watershed programming on BBC One in order to ensure the channel makes a greater contribution to delivering the BBC’s public purposes by being more distinctive in peak time”-&#xa0;&#xa0; “The value for money of BBC One and BBC Two could be improved by better meeting audiences’ expectations for more distinctive programming” -&#xa0;&#xa0; “We expect to see tangible and measurable actions that aim to address audience expectations better. We will monitor the outcomes of these actions primarily through tracking whether audience perception that BBC One is delivering fresh and new ideas is improving”.

[[[Putting Quality First]]], Dec 2010, the Trust concluded: “we would expect to see signs of improvement in audience perceptions by the end of 2011 and [we] will consider at that point whether we need to ask for further action from the Executive to address audience concerns”-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Trust also said that ‘distinctiveness is even more important in areas where there is a greater range of commercial competition… programme and content commissioners should seek out distinctiveness – not just potential popularity”

[[[Lord Patten]]], July 2011: “an important part of the BBC’s role is to take creative risks… and produce distinctive content that the market cannot”

[[[David Liddiment]]], June 2012: “We will continue to press BBC One to ‘take creative risks and innovate’ and to ‘regularly broadcast programmes of large scale and ambition’ in line with its service licence commitments”

[[[June 2012]]] the Trust assessed delivery against the service licence review requirements, and concluded that BBC’s One requirement to become more distinctive was simply ‘ongoing’ 

[[[Lord Patten]]], Jan 2012: “For several years now the Trust has been encouraging the BBC to be more 'distinctive' in its programming, particularly on the big mainstream television services. That means tapping into the spirit of the outsider, the interrogator of received wisdom. Another way of putting this is: we should be prepared to live more dangerously” http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/speeches/2013/tony-hall-vision.html  http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/review_report_research/strategic_review/interim_conclusions.pdf http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/our_work/service_reviews/service_reviews_progress.pdf http://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/insidethebbc/howwework/accountability/audienceinformation/ Various, most recently including Tony Hall article in the Financial Times, October 16 2013 ‘The BBC is a cornerstone of Britain’s creative industries’ “Yentob predicts end of in-house quotas”, 24 August 2013, Broadcast Office for National Statistics 58% of the public pick the BBC as the one source they trust the most, followed by ITV on 14%.
