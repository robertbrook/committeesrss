"&#xa0;\nA submission by:\n&#xa0;\nReptile &amp; Exotic Pet Trade Association&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPREAMBLE&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Reptile &amp; Exotic Pet Trade Association (REPTA)\n \nwas \nformed in 2005 to represent the interests of the \nUK\n reptile\n &amp;\n exotic pet\n industry. Its primary objectives are:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nREPTA predominately works with issues relating to the trade of reptiles and amphibians\n, but also promotes responsible keep\ning of so-called exotic pets, including primates and other taxa.\n \nThe \nUK\n has a long tradition of keeping reptiles and amphibians in captivity\n and with trade,\n with records dating back to the 1600’s\n and t\noday in the \nUK\n more than \na \nmillion households keep in e\nxcess of eight million reptiles and amphibians\n.\n \nT\nhe reptile industry is valued at over two hundred \nand fifty \nmillion\n £\n annually\n and significant numbers of other non-tradition, or exotic, species are also kept as companion animals.  \n&#xa0;\nThe trade in reptiles \nas pets is dominated by captive bred animals, \nwith \nsome 90% of the trade in 2013 comprising of such animals.\n  Species such as bearded dragons, leopard geckos, corn snakes and royal pythons are now regarded as domesticated species and \nform part of the mains\ntay of the general pet trade\n, \nno \nbeing \nlonger regarded as specialist species. \nThe reptile market is now dominated by relatively few commonly produced species but\n specialists\n have also kept \nover 3,600 species and subspecies\n, many of which have been bred in \ncaptivity, which h\nave been legally traded in the passed ten years. \n \n&#xa0;\nThe trade in p\nrimates is not a matter\n of\n \nconcern\n \nto \nthe day to day work of REPTA\n,\n as there is \neffectively \nno trade within the pet industry for primates as pets.  Notwithstanding \nthis, \ntheoretically should such a trade exist it would fall under our remit \nand \nit is\n, therefore,\n appropriate we should make a submission in respect of this \ninvestigation\n.      \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSUMMARY&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTRADE IN PRIMATES AS PETS&#xa0;1) \n \nIn the \nUK\n today the ‘trade’ (defined as sale from establishments licensed under the Pet Animals Act or imported for commercial purposes) \nof\n primates as pets is nonexistent.  \n&#xa0;\n2)  \nThere \nare\n thought to be \nm\nore than\n 3,000 licensed pet shops in the \nUK\n, although\n at the end of 2013\n there\n was\n no central record of licenses issue\nd\n so the precise number is unknown. \n \nAs far as a \nREPTA\n investigation\n \ncould determine, there were, however, no establishments licensed to s\nell primates\n. \n&#xa0;\n3)  \nThe \nsale of animals\n from establishment\ns\n licensed under the Pet Animals Act\n requires all species to be\n included on \na\n schedule\n. If any species (including primates) is \nsold\n without having been listed on this schedule, the owner would be\n in breach of the terms of licence\n, an offence\n actionable by the relevant Local Authority\n.\n \nT\nhe s\nale\n of any primate \nat an\n establishment \nlicensed under the Pet Animals Act\n that\n has specifically listed the relevant species on its schedule\n is\n both permissible \nand within the law, although constitutes an event sufficiently rare as to be unrecorded\n in recent history\n. There are\n procedures in place to deal with transgressions of\n existing\n law\n and further controls would be disproportionate to the scale of the potentia\nl problem (currently estimated as zero)\n.  \n \n&#xa0;\n4)  \nT\nhere has\n, historically,\n been a small trade in primates as pets\n, predominately wild\n-caught\n animals imported\n in the late nineteenth \nto late\n twentieth century\n, but today such a \ntrade is \nnonexistent.  A report \nby the RSPCA ‘Primates\n as Pets published \nin \nJuly 2012 \nrevealed\n that a survey of pet shops in 2008 \nshowed \nnone sold primates.\n \nThis research is by no means \nexhaustive and\n does not mean there are no pet shops licensed to sell primates,\n the fact that\n none are \nknow\nn\n to either the RSPCA or REPTA\n is, however, suggestive of that any such trade is negligible to non-existent\n.\n \n \n \n \n   \n5)  \nThe importation of primates into the \nUK\n \n(\nand \nEU) is regulated under EU Council Regulation 338/97: The EU Wildlife Trade \nRegulations.  All primates are listed on either Annex A or Annex B of the\nse\n regulations and\n,\n thus\n,\n require valid CITES documentation (import &amp; export certificates)\n.  The importation of primates for trade as pets is not banned\n per se\n,\n although \nthere is a pr\nohibition \nand REPTA is unaware of any legal\nly\n imported trade,\n either\n wild-caught or captive-bred\n,\n into the \nUK\n from third\n-party\n countries (i.e.\n those\n outside of the EU) since the \nenactment of \nRegulation \n338/97.\n \n&#xa0;\n6)  \nThere are many private keepers and breeders of primates (number unknown) who \nproduce\n and occasional\nly\n dispose \nof\n (sell)\n surplus animals.  \nSuch activity is \noutside the auspices of \nthe pet industry \nand is\n not \nlicensable under the Pet Animals Act\n.\n \nThe pet tra\nde and t\nhe Pet Animals Act is specific to the commercial sale of animals from \ne\nstablishment\ns\n (premises)\n of animals \n(primates or otherwise) \nintended to be kept \nas pets. \nThe Act \nfocus\nes\n on trade, i.e. the act of buying with the intent\n \nto \nre-\nsell\n,\n and specifically excludes the \nactivity of \nbreeding by private keepers. \nThe b\nreeding\n of companion\n animals is\n generally\n not licensable under the aforementioned Act\n, with the exception of\n dogs\n,\n breeding of which is regulated by\n the\n Breeding of Dogs Act\n.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDEFINING WHAT IS A PET?&#xa0;7)  \nDefining what constitutes\n a pet primate\n is a\n fundamental \nissue\n that needs to be \naddressed\n, \nas \nthe\n current\n situation is entirely ambiguous.  In l\nieu\n of a legal definition\n,\n REPTA would \nsuggest that\n a ‘pet primate’ \nshould be defin\ned\n \nas an animal \nkept in isolation\n from others of its species purely\n for human companionship\n and/or entertainment\n.\n It was historically common practice to keep primates in this manner but the practice has now fallen into disuse and primates are now kept in p\nurpose-built enclosures in appropriate social groups.\n&#xa0;\n8)  \nThere are numerous dictionary definitions of \nwhat we understand by the term \npet\n but not \nspecifically \npet primate\n and\n REPTA \nsources are\n unaware of any\n case law or\n legal definitions \non the issue \nother then \nthat offer\ned\n by HMRC in respect of application of Value Added Tax (VAT)\n which \ncan be \nfound at \nHMRC Reference: Notice 701/15 (December 2011)\n.  \n&#xa0;\n9)  \nThe keeping of non-domesticated animals has become a priority issue for the Animal Rights movemen\nt, often using the term ‘exotic pets’.  The reality is \nthat \nfor taxa other than \ntraditional \ndomestic pets (cats &amp; dogs) virtual all species kept \nb\ny man are exotic, i.e. not of native origin\n and that\n the keeping of native species is\n,\n in most cases\n,\n prohibit\ned.\n \nThe Animal Rights movement is a very powerful lobby that often masquerade\ns\n under the banner of animal welfare, \nalthough the two\n are separate ideolog\nies. \nThe keeping of \nprimate\ns\n is an emotive issue and it is \nimperative that \nan \nanimal rights\n agenda\n does\n not cloud the \nissue\ns pertaining to the private ownership of\n primates in captivity.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPRIVATE OWNERSHIP OF PRIMATES&#xa0;\n10)  \nU\nnder \nUK\n,\n and \ni\nndeed EU\n,\n legislation animals are regarded as chattels, i.e. property\n,\n and \nownership is,\n thus\n,\n \nafforded\n protection\n as\n enshrined under the Human Rights Act.  It is\n,\n therefore\n,\n \nassumed unrealistic \nto\n suggest that private ownership of primates should be banned, \nbut\n ensure that controls are in place to ensure\n that \nthe manner\n in which they are maintained \nis appropriate to the\nir welfare.\n&#xa0;\n11)  \nThe keeping of a\n solitary\n primate as a ‘pet’ is already effectively unlawful (illegal)\n under t\nhe Animal Welfare Act\n, as\n underpinned by a Code of Practice for primates, “\nCode of Practice\n \nfor the Welfare of Privately Kept\n \nNon-Human Primates\n”\n,\n published\n in\n 2009.   Compliance with this code precludes the keeping of primate\ns\n as pet\ns\n, i.e. a \nsolitary\n \nanimal\n kept in isolation in an unsuitable environment for human companionship.  \n&#xa0;\n12)  \nNon-compliance with a Code of Practice is not\n,\n in itself\n,\n an\n offence, \nbut\n places the evidential burden on the keeper to demonstrate they are discharging the Duty of Care enforced upon them by the Animal Welfare Act.   \nREPTA is of the opinion this would be an insurmountable challenge\n to\n the keeping of a single prima\nte as ‘pet’ (companion animal) and would\n,\n thus\n,\n render the keep\ner liable\n to prosecution under Section 4 or 9 of the Animal Welfare Act. \n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nEFFECTIVENESS OF CURRENT LEGISLATION &#xa0;13)  \nIt is clear\n that\n \nthere is already sufficient legislation\n under the Animal Welfare Act\n that prevents the\n inappropriate \nkeeping of primates as pets \nand that \ncurrent\n legislation is\n adequate and\n effective\n.\n Current\n legislation\n is appropriate and proportionate in that it\n prohibits the inappropriate keeping of primate\ns, but facilitates the responsible private ownership of such animals.  This legislation continues to be used \nby the RSPCA\n,\n and other prosecutors\n,\n \nto take action against inappropriate keeping.  \n&#xa0;\n14)  \nREPTA research suggests \nthat in the pas\nt\n twelve months the RSPCA have \nsuccessfully \nsecured\n at least\n five successful convictions against individuals keeping primates as pets, \nwhich\n is clear and irrefutable evidence\n that current\n legislation is working and fit for purpose. \nWe should not\n, however,\n c\nonfuse successful prosecutions of \na few \nprivate keepers \nof\n ‘pet’ primates as \nindicative \nthat\n private keepers of primates \nare\n poor\n as\n \nmost are maintaining their animals to an extremely high standard. Many other taxa of commonly kept pet species (primarily d\nogs and cats) are subject to very high levels of\n successful prosecutions for \nbreaches\n of the Animal Welfare Act\n, although there is no suggestion that these species should be the subject of ownership restrictions and/or bans\n.\n  \n&#xa0;\n15)  \nIf there is any\n issue i\nt is\n lack of appropriate enforcement of the\n current (adequate)\n legislation.  If the current legislation is\n, as REPTA would suggest,\n broadly fit for purpose but not enforced effectively\n,\n it is difficult to see how \nincreased\n legislation without \nfurther enfor\ncement \nresources would be workable\n.\n  \n&#xa0;&#xa0;COMMENTS &amp; OBSERVATIONS&#xa0;\n16)  \nREPTA recently participated \nin the Working Group which revised Model Standards for Pet Shop Licensing\n \nunderpin\nning\n the Pet Animals Act.  The\nse\n standards have been substantially \namended\n since the last revision of 1998\n and, whilst t\nhe WG \nconsidered including\n model standards for trading in primates\n,\n \ndismissed\n this due to\n \nevidence suggest\ning no\n \nsuch trade existed.\n&#xa0;\n17)  \nThe Working Group concluded that there was no evidence to suggest there\n was any trade in primates by establishments regulated under the Pet Animals Act\n but,\n should this prove inaccurate\n,\n \nsuch \nguidance could be drafted\n and incorporated into the\n revised\n \nM\nodel \nS\ntandards. \n \n&#xa0;\n18)  \nREPTA is a member of the Pet Advertising Advisory \nGroup (PAAG)\n which \nrecently produced a voluntary Code of Practice (Minimum Standards) for internet \nadvertising\n,\n launched at a parliamentary \nreception on the \n4\nth\n of September 2013\n.\n   \nThe issue of advertising of primates on the internet has been discussed \nwithin the group, but conclu\nded that\n a very high percentage of such ad\nvertisement \nare\n bogus\n \n(\nscams\n)\n.\n&#xa0;\n19)  \nFurther regulation of private primate ownership, if any is needed, must be reasonable and proportionate\n and w\nhat appears to be lacking is hard empiri\ncal data\n that this is necessary. T\nhere is a plethora of anecdotal and \nspeculative \ntestimony \nprovided by organisations and individual\ns\n opposed to private ownership\n of primates and\n the v\neracity\n of such evidence should be questioned.\n&#xa0;\n20)  \nEven basic informat\nion\n,\n such as how many primates kept by private keepers\n,\n is unknown\n, although i\nt is speculated the\n number of primates kep\nt by private keepers var\nies\n from\n low\n \nestimate\ns\n of \n3,000 to 5,000 \nto as\n high as 15,000 to 20,000\n (or \nhigher\n)\n. \nWithout\n such basic informat\nion assessing the need for further regulation\n,\n such as \n(\nperhaps\n)\n the licensing of all private owners of primates \nis at best conjuncture and not based on\n \nreliable\n \nsupporting \nevidence. \nO\nbtaining accurate data on the current number of primates kept by private\n keepers would be challenging\n but\n other pertinent data would be \naccessible\n and could \nbe valuable in assessing requirement for further legislation (if any).\n&#xa0;\n21)  \nD\nata would ideal\nly be\n collected and collated by an independent body, i.e. not an organisation \nthat campaigns against (or indeed for) private ownership of primates\n which \nis\n,\n perhaps\n,\n a task the Select Committee\n could con\nsi\nder undertaking during the course of its enquiry. \n \nD\nata\n \nthat is eminently available \nfor\n \nretrieval from \nthe relevant government\n de\npartments\n (local &amp; central) \ncould be co\nmpiled\n for a specific time period (suggest the previous five years) and could include\n:   \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n22) \nT\nh\nis\n data would be\n \nof value \nin establishing the true extent of issues relating to primates as pets, even if it is not possible to qua\nnt\nify in relation to the number\n of animals kept.\n \n  \n&#xa0;\nCONCLUSIONS &#xa0;23)  \nThe \nfundamental issue is not lack of \nlegislation\n, it\n \nis \nlack of appropriate \nenforcement of the legislation\n due \nto lack of funding \nand direction from central government.\n  Animal welfare is a low priority\n for\n Local Au\nthorities, \nwhich, \nwhilst regrettable\n,\n is understandable\n when resources are stretched thinly.\n \nLegislation governing the private ownership or trade\n of animals\n, i.e. The Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976, the Animal Welfare Act 2006 and the Pet Animals Act 1951\n are all broadly fit for purpose\n. Any\n failure of these Acts\n is due to problems with\n enforcement by Local Authorities that are \ninadequate\nly\n equipped to fulfil the task\ns\n demanded of them.  \n&#xa0;24)  \nThe administration of the aforementioned Acts (and the Zoo Lic\nensing Act) \nshould, therefore,\n be removed from Local Authority administration and discharged by central government.  \nUntil such time as this happens we shall continue to see inconsistencies and failures in administration of legislation that will compromise\n the welfare of \nboth\n primates but other species.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1\n2\nth\n January, 2014   \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
