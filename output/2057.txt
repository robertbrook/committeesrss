[[[Draft Deregulation Bill:  Housing provisions]]]&#xa0;I am pleased to see the progress being made on deregulation, in which effort the Deregulation Bill makes some steps forward.  Apart from easing burdens, the exercise of writing the Bill has provided a lesson in the byzantine structure of exiting legislation, which one hopes will be resolved, when time allows, with repeal and consolidation.My observations are limited to the sections on Housing. The Bill has two clauses on this broad topic, both welcome.  A third Clause could resolve a longstanding regulatory drafting error found in some of the key housing statutes.The two Sections of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987 given below deal with a real need and so should be retained, though they do require reform.(a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Section 47 of the Landlord &amp; Tenant Act 1987 provides:“(1)              Where any written demand is given to a tenant of premises to which this part applies, the demand must contain the following information, namely(a)              the name and address of the landlord, and(b)              if that address is not in England and Wales, an address in England and Wales at which notices (including notices in proceedings) may be served on the landlord by the tenant.”(b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Section 48 of the same Act states in contrast:(1)              A landlord of premises to which this Part applies shall by notice furnish the tenant with an address in England and Wales at which notices (including notices in proceedings) may be served on him by the tenant.&#xa0;Similar provisions are found in other, later housing statutes.  There are two objections:&#xa0;

[[[1.1]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Geographical conceptual error]]]The Act specifies that the address provided to the tenant be “in England and Wales”.  There is no justification for this restriction instead of “in the United Kingdom”.  The restriction appears to be an error, not found in earlier statutes, and places an unnecessary burden on landlords resident in other parts of the United KingdomAll a tenant needs is an address to which he can effectively send letters, notices and proceedings to the Landlord.  For this purpose any address in the United Kingdom will suffice. This is recognised in statues before 1987, for example provisions for service in Section 196 of the Law of Property Act 1925.If justification for the local restriction is sought in that was that proceedings of the English courts might be issued to the address provided, that is no longer applicable: proceedings of an English court can be served throughout the United Kingdom.  The Royal Mail delivers post as swiftly to Londonderry as to London and proceedings of the county court may be served as easily in Lanark as in Lancaster.The result of this geographical restriction is that if the owner of a house in Carlisle moves a few miles up the road to Longtown, he must appoint an expensive agent, but if he moves to Cornwall he can do it himself; it is as if to say “Scots are not welcome to own houses in England”.This error appears in the 1987 Act and in certain later housing statutes but not, apparently, in earlier statutes.

[[[Inconsistency and unexpected burden]]]While Section 48 of the 1987 Act requires that the tenant be given just one address, which may be that of an agent, Section 47 requires that of the landlord’s agent and the landlord’s personal home address. In Beitov Properties v Elliston Bentley Martin [2012] UKUT 133 (LC), the Lands Tribunal confirmed that where a service charge demand gave an agent’s address (which was in England and Wales) but not the Landlord’s personal home address, that demand was invalid.Any average landlord would expect Section 47 to have the same requirements as Section 48, but they are not, and it is peculiar that the more burdensome requirement be that attaching not to the main notice to the tenant but to every single rent and service charge demand.  It is a trap into which a landlord may inadvertently fall, and falling lose the value of his capital in his house.Furthermore, Section 48 requires that the landlord disclose his personal home address, which he may have good reason not to reveal to a violent tenant.2.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In the following sections the words “England and Wales” should be changed to “the United Kingdom”:2.1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Landlord and Tenant Act 1987, Section 22(2)(a), 27(2)(a), 47(1)(b), 48(1).2.1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993, in 13(3)(f), 15(5)(a), 15(5)(b)(iii), 15(7)(a), 16(3)(c), 16(5)(c), 21(6), [22(2)(a)], 42(3)(e), 45(4), 99(2), 99(2)(b), 99(3). 2.1.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995, Section 27(2)(c).&#xa0;2.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In Sub-section 47(1) of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987, change the wording to:“(1)              Where any written demand is given to a tenant of premises to which this part applies, the demand must contain an address in the United Kingdom at which notices (including notices in proceedings) may be served on the Landlord by the tenant.14 September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
