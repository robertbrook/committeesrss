[[[NASUWT]]]

[[[ ]]]&#xa0;The NASUWT’s submission sets out the Union’s views on the key issues identified by the Committee in the terms of reference for the Inquiry. The submission looks at definitions of the terms ‘white’ and ‘working class’, considers the reasons for the underachievement of white working-class children, outlines key things that the Government should be doing to address the issue and highlights some of the critical factors underpinning successful work in schools to improve educational outcomes for white working-class children.&#xa0;The NASUWT would be happy to give oral evidence to the Select Committee.&#xa0;The NASUWT is the largest teachers’ union representing teachers and school leaders in the UK.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
