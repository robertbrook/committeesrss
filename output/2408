default The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman found that 20% of their fatal incident investigations into self-inflicted deaths in custody had found evidence that the person who died was subject to bullying or intimidation by other prisoners in the three months prior to their death. PPPO (2011) 
defaultLearning from PPO investigations: violence reduction, bullying and safety

defaultThe only other avenue of “appeal” available to bereaved families is 
defaultby persuading the Attorney General to exercise his or her power of fiat under s.13 of the Coroners Act 1988. 
defaultThis 
defaultsets a high threshold to be met for an inquest verdict (inquisition) to be quashed and for ordering a new inquest into a death. It involves a complex and lengthy process which requires the Attorney-General’s consent. The Attorney General can only exercise his fiat if there is new evidence to be considered. As a result, this remedy has only been granted to bereaved families in rare cases – the most recent example being the quashing of the original inquests into the 96 deaths at Hillsborough Stadium in 1989.
