[[[LONDON CHALLENGE]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The NUT believes that the London Challenge provides an example of a sustainable approach to school improvement that has resulted in the capital’s schools, one suffering a poor reputation, being highly regarded and a model for others. The NUT has set out its case in its evidence to the Education Committee Inquiry into ‘School Partnerships and Cooperation. A summary of the record of the challenge by the DfE Evaluation Report’s lead author is also available on the NUT website.&#xa0;London Challenge was not only highly successful; it was also, unlike the academies programme, extremely cost effective. Over three years the funding for City Challenge was £160 million, considerably cheaper than the £8.5 billion reportedly spent on the academies programme over two years.&#xa0;Ignoring cost-effective school improvement options and promoting costly and contentious ones should not be countenanced by Ministers at a time when budgets are under pressure.

[[[FREE SCHOOLS]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The NUT believes that the process for approving and establishing free schools lacks transparency, ignores the evidence on the need for new school places locally and fails to take account of the impact of free schools on neighbouring schools.&#xa0;The NUT’s evidence to support this view are set out its recently published document, ’Free Schools, Free for All’ which is available on the NUT’s website.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;DfE ‘Sponsored Academies Funding: Guidance for Sponsors’  www.gov.uk/government/publications/sponsored-academies-funding-guidance-for-sponsors [Accessed 16 December 2013].
