"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Edward Stubbs, former Detective Sergeant, Metropolitan Police&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nMy name is Edward Stubbs. I only recently became aware that a Parliament committee was looking into Police crimes at count figures. Some time ago a member of the Police Federation stated the \nreasoner\n Police \ndont\n act as Whistle blowers was because of The \nLeverson\n enquiry. I don't know how much Police service this member had but Police have been \nfiddlingintend\n crime figures for last 60 years long before  \nLeverson\n.\n&#xa0;\nI se\nrved 32 years in Metropolitan \nPolice. Almost 29yrs as a \nDetective most as a Detective Se\nrgeant.\n I\n worked at 12 different police stations including 3 years at Scotland Yard. The half mile distance from Edgware station to Church Street Market on Saturday was not paved with gold as in case of Dick Whittington. It must have been paved with wallets purses. The same with Oxford Street on late night shopping  on Thursday. In this day and  age it's mobile phones and pu\nr\nses. At both police stations would  queue at counter to report THIER property stolen. These matters were reported as THEFT FROM PERSON. When they were submitted The Detective Chief Superintendent at time said he wanted statements from all victims to prove THIER property was stolen. If they couldn't produce evidence of THEFT it was recorded as PROPERTY LOST IN THE \nSTREET.as\n a result nothing was ever investigated as a crime. If by some \nmiricle\n any one was arrested and admitted number of offences. The original offences were re-classified which improved the clear up rate. You then had clear ups for no crimes. \n&#xa0;\nThe Home Secretary keeps saying reported crime figures are falling.\n \nthis is down to members of the public NOT REPORTING CRIME BECAUSE THEY KNOW WANT BE INVESTIGATED. If an elderly person tries \ntoo\n report a crime they \nar\n greeted was WE HAVNT GOT OFFICERS AVAILABLE? CAN YOU COME TO POLICE STATION AND REPORT IT? The reason there \nar\n no Police available to report crime is because they \nar\n manning road blocks to report minor Road Traffic Offences which boost the figures and \ndont\n need  great \ndeat\n of brain power. They then spend rest time in Police station w\nriting traffic reports.\n&#xa0;\nNumerous \noffeces\n of Burglary were reduced to NO crime or CRIMINAL damage. If a suspect was arrested and admired offences these were reclassified to improve clear up rates. Every day offences known as grid offences (MORE SERIOUS crimes) were suited to \nDivional\n Headquarters to be submitted to area headquarters then to Office in charge of crime to SCOTLAND yard who would then report to THE commissioner. Crimes of alleged RAPE were reduced to INDECENT assault. Police regulations stated ALL allegations or RAPE MUST be investigated by Detective Inspector. Numerous \noffencs\n of Rape were investigated by inexperienced detective due to pressure of work. This accounted for large number of not guilty verdicts.\n&#xa0;\nThis is outside \nur\n remit but you should know how save millions of pounds from Police budget. Get rid of half departments at Scotland Yard. When the decided to promote \nany one\n who had a degree in \nPlastercine\n or from \nlegaland\n without any knowledge of police work. They had to create departments in Scotland Yard to place all Deputy Assistant \nCommissiones\n Commanders THIER Superintendent staff officers with all accompanying \nstaff.they\n spent most days having meetings and issuing memos to justify THIER \nexcistance\n. If private company was run like this it would go bankrupt in very little time.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
