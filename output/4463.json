"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.1\n              \nKent County Council (KCC)\n, as the Local Transport Authority \n(LTA) \nfor \nKent\n, and \nas \npart of the South East Local Enterprise Partnership (SELEP) and Local Transport Body (SELTB) \nwhich also consists of\n Medway, East Sussex, Essex, Southend and \nThurrock\n,\n welcomes the opportunity to s\nubmit written evidence to this i\nnquiry\n on local decision \nmak\ning on transport expenditure\n. \nKCC\n would be very happy to expand on any aspect either in writing or as oral evidence. \n  \n&#xa0;\n1.2\n  \n              \nKCC’s \nsubmission of evidence can be summarised as follows:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n              \nKCC \nrecommends to the committee that action is taken by the Government to: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1\n              \nThe rationale for the Government’s proposals to de\nvolve to a local level decision \nma\nking on transport expenditure \nis\n to empower local communitie\ns and partnerships (local\n authoritie\ns and \nbusinesses) to identify and deliver transport schemes to meet \ntheir own \nlocal prior\nities, in line with the Government’s ‘localism’ agenda. In principle, this \nis\n a sound rationale, to dev\nolve decision making on transport expenditure to where there is expert knowledge of \nlocal \ntransport pro\nblems and appropriate solutions. H\nowever, in practice \nit is unlikely that \nthe new\n arrangements \nwill\n deliver this intended outcome.\n \n \n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nIn practice, de\ncision making on transport sche\nmes is st\nill highly centralised.\n Local Transport Bodies (LTBs) \n“\nprimary role is to decide which \ninvestments should be prioritised, to review and approve individual business cases for those investments, and to ensure effective\n delivery of the programme\n”\n. However,\n the implementation of an assurance framework\n,\n approved by the\n Department for Transport\n (DfT), under the rationale of \n“\nensuring that LTBs are fit for purpose and have the necessary arrangements in place to ensure value\n for money and sound decision making\n”\n, in practice\n \nresults in the DfT \nhaving a decisive say on what\n schemes are funded\n.\n \nTherefore\n local decision making\n \nis inhibited \nas we still need to meet the criteria \nset by the \nDfT i\nn evaluating transport schemes.\n Thes\ne criteria do not fully reflect \nthe G\novernment’s top priority of delivering growth as they still use factors such as vehicle operating cost\ns\n and journey time savings\n. \nSuch factors are often not relevant for the schemes we need to deliver to unlock growth.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n              \nThe DfT encourages\n scheme promoters to model and appraise transport schemes by following a 'proportionate' approach. The principle of proportionality is associated with the size of a transport scheme and the type and significance of benefits the schem\ne would deliver. However, the DfT has\n not yet made it clear in \nWebTAG\n (Transport Analysis Guidance)\n how to apply the principle of proportionality in preparing business cases. The lack of \nthis guidance coupled with the requirement to comply with\n strict WebT\nAG rules\n,\n do\nes\n not enab\nle\n scheme promoters to take advantage of \nthe \ndevolved local decision making process.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n4\n              \nThe requirement for schemes to have a fully developed business case and to be WebTAG \ncompliant\n is of little difference from the former Regional Funding Allocation (RFA) system when the DfT directly approved individual \nlocal \nmajor scheme bids\n.\n A scheme may address local needs but if it does not satis\nfy the DfT’s appraisal process \nit will not be fund\ned. T\nherefore this does not give local autonomy on transport scheme expenditure\n,\n but rather maintains central Government control over which projects proceed. \n&#xa0;\n2.\n5\n              \nThe complex governance arrangements for the de\nv\nolution of transport funding are\n \nalso \na major\n reason\n why the \nnew system \nof local decision making \non transport expenditure \nis not effective in practice.\n The formation of LTBs in addition to Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) has added a further layer of bureaucracy \nand the \nrelationship between the t\nwo bodies is very \nambiguous\n.\n \nIn the South East, it is not clear whether the South East LTB (SELTB) has the right to make its own decisions on the prioritisation of transport schemes\n,\n or whether decisions also need to be ratified by the South East LEP (SELE\nP)\n. In\n practice,\n the SE\nLEP has final sign off, therefore que\nstioning the purpose of the LTB. Also, this is in an area where the LTB has identical geography to \nthe \nLEP, something which is not necessarily the case with\n all LTBs and LEPs across \nEngland\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n6\n              \nThe relationship between the LEP and its c\nonstituent local authorities is also\n challenging in terms of agreeing consensus on the prioritisation of \ntransport schemes given that each local authorit\ny answers to its own electorate. T\nh\ne LEP (and also the LTB)\n,\n \nas their own entities\n,\n \nare\n not \naccountable to an electorate\n. T\nhe involvement of the business community, although sound in principle \nin terms of identifying the types of transport schemes that will \nbest \nsupport business needs and encourage economic growth, \nalso raises questions regarding accountability of the business LEP members\n and to what extent they do reflect the views of the wider business community. \n&#xa0;\n2.\n7\n              \nA better model would be to devolve local decision making on transport expenditure\n direct\n to \na ‘fe\nderated’ LEP consisting of smaller partnership groupings of \nLocal Transport Authorities (LTAs) which have the experience of delivering transport schem\nes and are political\n bodies\n accountable to their \nown \nelectorate\n.\n \nIn the SE\nLEP, \nKent County Council\n and Medway Council\n (unitary)\n is an ideal partnership within a \n‘federated’ LEP \nalong with the other SE\nLEP authorities forming their own \nfederated areas\n, each able to make autonomous decisions on transport expenditure under the overall ‘umbrella’ of devolve\nd funding to the South East LEP.  \n \n  \n  \n&#xa0;\n3.1\n              \nLocal Transport Authorities (LTAs) do have the capacity to deliver local transport schemes\n as demonstrated by the delivery of projects under the previous f\nunding arrangements, i.e. once \nlocal \nmajor scheme funding had been secured from central Government. The most recent example from \nKent\n was the completion of the East Kent Access (EKA) road\n, an £87m scheme delivered by Kent County Council on time and to budg\net. \nLTAs also have the capacity to assess and prioritise local transport schemes as\n demons\ntrated by the work that is being\n \ndone by local authorities for the prioritisation and assessment of transport schemes being funded through Local Transport Body (LTB) \ndevolved funding\n;\n and the prioritisation work currently underway for the new single Local Growth Fund (LGF)\n devolved to Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs)\n post 2015.\n  \n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nThe LTB and the \nLEP\n, as bodies in their own right, do not have the capacity to assess, prioritise or deliver local transport schemes. The LTB and the LEP do not have the staff resources to complete such detailed and technical tasks and ultimately the work comes back to the l\nocal authorities that make up the LTB and the LEP. This is at a time when local authority resources are under intense budgetary pressure. Alternatively, additional project costs are incurred through outsourcing work to external consultants. The private sec\ntor organisations involved with the LEP also do not have the capacity or expertise to complete transport scheme appraisal and prioritisation. \n&#xa0;\n3.\n3\n              \nThe \nproblem with the \nLTB and LEP taking forward such a process is that it adds another layer of evaluation\n, \nas once the LTA has\n prioritised its schemes these then \nneed to go forward to a L\nTB/LEP prioritisation process. \nThe experience of Kent County Council of this to \ndate\n is that processes are often unclear and inconsistent and ultimately it adds time and money,\n especially to the consultancy sector who are commissioned to \nact as independent evaluators. \nGiven the size of the funding pot being put forward for \nthe \nsingle LGF, it is likely that considerable time and money will need to be allocated for the LEP wide pr\nocess. Neither will assist the case for delivering the sche\nmes we need to unlock growth quickly and could be avoided completely if \nthere is the flexibility to award \nfunding to\n federated LEP areas consisting of \nsmaller partnerships of \nLTAs.\n              \n3.\n4\n              \nThe optimu\nm delivery body \nis the LTA\n working within a ‘federated’ LEP model\n. Funding should be\n \nallocated to\n these \nfederated LEP areas with their\n LTAs \nassess\ning\n, prioritis\ning\n and deliver\ning\n their own schemes rather than the current \ntwo-tiered \nprocess of LTBs and LEPs trying to agree their \npriorities\n once the LTA has already completed this work for its own area\n. Reaching agreement on priorities\n is extremely difficult given the different poli\ntical and business interests that make up the LTBs and \nLEPs\n. Each LTA, as an individual political organisat\nion, needs to be able to assess\n and prioritise its own transport schemes, the delivery of which wi\nll always fall to the LTA of\n the county or unitary authori\nty\n that the scheme is within\n. Schemes that cross\n local authority boundaries will require collaboration and partnership working between the authorities affected\n;\n and this \nhappens through\n direct interaction between LTAs\n.\n      \n \n \n  \n&#xa0;\n              \n4\n.1\n              \nThe level of\n fu\nnding for \nlocal \nmajor \ntransport schemes allocated to the South East Local Transport Body (SELTB) for the period of four years \nfrom 2015/16 to 2018/19 is £65.9 million\n or just under £16.5 million per annum\n.\n This level of funding is wholly inadequate for an LTB/Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) area consisting of two large counties in \nKent\n and Essex, plus East Sussex and the urban\n unitary authorities of Medway, \nThurrock\n and Southend.\n The f\nunding \nalso \ndoes not cover the full costs of the schemes being proposed, as a ‘local’ contribution is also required from local authorities, business partners or developer contributions. \n Nor does \nit begin to meet the needs identified\n if aspirations around housing provision and jobs growth are to be realised\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n              \nAllocating\n this limited amount of funding between the authorities\n, each with their own \ntransport priorities\n,\n has\n proved\n an a\nrduous\n task\n, \nrequired\n a considerable amount of staff resource\n, as well as consultancy support\n. The result is that \nKent County Council\n has provisional funding for just two \nof \nthe \ntwel\nve prioritised schemes that it\n put forward. \nT\nhe unitary authorities\n within the South Ea\nst LTB/LEP\n will not receive funding for any of their proposed \ntransport \nschemes. \n \nOverall, it could be questioned whether the considerable effort put into this process was worthwhile, particularly for the authorities that secured no funding.  \n&#xa0;\n4.\n3\n              \nAs \npreviously stated, the principle of devolving decision making on transport expenditure to a local level is sound and one which\n is supported by local authorities, therefore returning to the previous system of bidding to central Go\nvernment\n for funds through \nthe Regional Funding Allocation (RFA) \nis not being advocated. H\nowever\n, \nthere needs to be a\n more effective system\n and \nKent County Council\n is of the view that this can be achieved through a ‘federated’ LEP model.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5\n.1\n              \nIn 2015\n,\n local major transport scheme funding will be devolved to Local Transport Bodies (LTBs) with the allocations for the four years \nup to 2019 already decided, e.g. the South East LTB is allocated £65.9 million. Parallel to this \nin 2015\n,\n will be the introduction of the single Local Growth Fund (LGF) with devolved funding for not only transport but also skills and housing. The transport element of this fund is also not just restricted t\no local major transport schemes \nas with LTB funding,\n b\nut \nalso \nincludes all transport funding, e.g. Integrated Transport \nBlock \n(ITB)\n, i.e. schemes under £5million, Local Sustainable Transport Fund (LSTF) and \nstructural\n maintenance funding. \n&#xa0;\n5.2\n              \nThe LGF \nis allocated to L\nocal Enterprise Partnerships (L\nEPs\n)\n not \nLTBs\n,\n which bring\ns\n into the question the role of the LTB. With local major transport scheme devolved funding, the LTB is in theo\nry the decision making body and has\n an as\nsurance framework with the DfT (\nalthough in practice, as previously stated in regards t\no the South East, the role of the LTB in relation to the LEP is unclear\n)\n. With the LGF devolved to LEPs, this makes the role of the LTB even more unclear, unless the LTB serves \nsolely \nas an advisory board to the LEP on transport decisions given that the LE\nP has to make decisions on all devolved funding \nand \nnot just transport. The South East is fortunate in that LEP and LTB geographies are identical, however in many parts of the country this is not the case and the role of the LTB\n,\n with \nsingle pot funding th\nrough the LGF\n devolved to the LEP\n,\n is even more uncertain. \n&#xa0;\n5.3\n              \nPost 2015\n,\n a situation will therefore exist where there are two parallel devolved funding streams: local major transport scheme funding administered by the LTB; and funding for all transport \nexpenditure, along with funding for skills and housing, from a single LGF pot administered by the LEP. The Government’s preference for the \nlocal \ndevolution \nof funding to\n a single LGF pot, of which transport is just part of it\n, negates the need for an LTB a\nnd therefore these bodies should be disbanded\n with responsibility for overseeing LTB funding and project delivery passed to the LEP\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.4\n              \nThe level of funding allocated thro\nugh the LGF\n for the period 2015-21\n,\n \nwill be on the strength\n of the LEP\n’\ns\n Strategic Economic Plan (SEP)\n,\n which will specify the transport infrastructure required \nto support a committed\n level of growth in homes and jobs. Therefore transport schemes need to demonstrate that \nh\nomes and/or jobs are dependent on the scheme in order f\nor it to \nhave a chance of securing\n funding. \nE\nconomic growth is of utmost \nimportance; however,\n there are also transport schemes that are \nneeded\n for other reasons, e.g. safety, congestion relief and environmental benefits. \nT\nhese schemes may not directly supp\nort the delivery of new homes and jobs, therefore stand \nless\n chance of being delivered through the LGF and \nthis \nsubstantially reduces the mix of transport improvements that are required to address a range of problems, not \njust the need for \nnew employment a\nnd housing.\n Schemes that address safety, congestion and environmental problems will in many cases indirectly support growth in homes and jobs even if not necessarily directly, therefore they should still be considered for funding through the LGF.\n   \n    \n \n&#xa0;\n5.5\n              \nA LEP wide \nSEP\n is currently being developed for the South East\n.  Given the vast geography of this area and what will be required to reflect the differing needs across it, a\n more efficient and effective system would be for \na ‘\nfederated\n’\n \nLEP \nmodel with e\nach federated area better refle\ncting local economic geography.\n \nKent County Council\n would prefer to operate in partnership with Medway Council (unitary) in a ‘federated’ South East LEP with its own SEP and \npowers to \nadmini\nster\n its own LGF allocation.   \n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6\n.1\n              \nThe\n lines of accountability for local decision making on transport expenditure in terms of the South East Local Enterprise Partnership (SELEP) and Transport Body (SELTB) are not clear. As \npreviously described, the role of the LTB in relation to the LEP is unc\nlear and both the LTB and the LEP are not accountable to an electorate, rather each local authority within the LTB and LEP is accountable to its own electorate\n. There is\n no \npublic \naccountability governing the business element of the LEP\n.\n&#xa0;\n6.2\n              \nThere needs t\no be clear lines of accountability when it comes to decision making on all expenditure. Local authorities are able to do this \nwith the transparent decision making processes that they implement with the Cabinet system which includes Cabinet Committees, Cabi\nnet Member, Leader of the Council and full Council decisions. \nCouncils are ultimatel\ny accountable to the public\n they serve\n and through the democratic process the public can vote for new representation \nwithin the electoral cycle if they are not satisfied wi\nth the decisions being made on their behalf.\n&#xa0;\n6.3\n              \nHowever, with the curr\nent proposals for devolved local decision making on transport expenditure being implemented post 2015, there is a\n clear lack of accountability in\n both the LEP and the LTB. Given the di\nfficulty of agreeing consensus on transport priorities within the LTB and LEP\n,\n with each local authority seek\ning to promote schemes that\n benefit their individual areas, the method of how overall decisions are made and the accountability of that decision ma\nking process \nis brought into question. LEP business representatives also have a say in the decision making process yet they are not democratically accountable.\n&#xa0;\n6.4\n              \nDecisions taken on transport expenditure by the LTB and the LEP do not have clear lines of \naccountability and \nas such \ndevolved funding \nshould\n be given direct to\n federated LEP areas\n. This will allow\n local authorities\n have more direct control over transport expenditure and can take decisions through a\n clear and transparent process\n;\n and are ultimat\nely accountable to the electorate. \n \n \n  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7.1\n              \nKent County Council\n recommends that in order to devolve decision making on transport expenditure to a local level, the need for schemes to follow the Department for Transport’s\n \n(DfT’s) \nWebTAG \ntransport \nappraisal guidance and develop full business cases needs to be relaxed. A\n high level of staff resource is required for this level of detailed scheme assessment which puts local authorities\n under extreme pressure in the current climate of budgetary cuts.\n \nFurthermore, much of the \nWebTAG guidance \ndoes not \nmake it clear how to \nrefl\nect \nthe current \ntop priority policy \nof\n deliver\ning\n growth\n in the transport scheme appraisal process. \nIn order for there to be local decision making, this stipulation from central Government \nof WebTAG compliant schemes \nmust be re\nlaxed\n.\n&#xa0;\n7.2\n              \nKent County \nCouncil recommends that the single pot Local Growth Fund (LGF) needs to allow transport schemes to be delivered that are not directly related to supporting the delivery of new homes and jobs. Although economic growth is the top priority, there are transpor\nt improvements that are needed for a variety of other reasons including safety\n, congestion\n and environmental benefits\n; and although they may not necessarily directly\n support \nnew\n homes and jobs\n, in many cases these schemes will indirectly support growth\n. Tr\nue local decision making would allow local authorities to make judgements on what schemes are funded based on local needs.\n&#xa0;\n7.3\n              \nKent County Council\n recommends that the complex governance \narrangement with the devolution of local \nmajor \ntransport \nscheme fundi\nng administered\n through Local Transport Bodies (LTBs) is removed\n. Post 2015\n,\n there will be two parallel systems with local major transport scheme funding devolved to LTBs but with further transport \nfunding available through the single \nLGF\n allocated to\n Loca\nl Enterprise Partnerships\n \n(\nLEPs\n)\n. There needs to be one system, therefore the LTB should be \ndisbanded \nin favour of the single LGF. \n&#xa0;\n7.4\n              \nKent County Council\n recommends that the\n \nsingle \nLGF should have the flexibility of allocation\n to\n federated areas within LEPs consisting of smaller partnerships of local authorities. Within the South East LEP, Kent and Medway would form a federated area and administer their own devolved funding\n. \nThis will allow decisions on transport expenditure to be\n taken through a \nmore local and \ntransparent decision making process that is accountable to each lo\ncal authority’s own electorate. \nThe delivery of local transport schemes will ultimately come down to t\nhe Local Transport Authority (LTA)\n, and the processes of\n scheme assessment, prioritisation and delivery would be more efficient and effective within a ‘federated’ LEP model.\n LTAs are also capable of working with neighbouring authorities to deliver transport schemes that cross local authority boundaries.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1\n&#xa0;\n Local Frameworks for funding major transport schemes: Guidance for Local Transport Bodies, DfT, November 2011\n Local Frameworks for funding major transport schemes: Guidance for Local Transport Bodies, DfT, November 2011\n&#xa0;\n"
