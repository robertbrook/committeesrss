[[[Key Points]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;

[[[Section 1: General Comments]]]&#xa0;The RSPB strongly supports the principle of identifying opportunities for more efficient and effective regulation. So, we are receptive to ideas on ways of streamlining legislative requirements and using alternative policy tools so long as this does not adversely affect regulatory outcomes, particularly in relation to the natural environment. However, a reform process that is partial, inappropriately designed or poorly implemented risks undermining the very public interests that such regulations are designed to protect.  &#xa0;Since the 2010 general election, the Coalition Government in the UK has committed itself to an ambitious and wide-ranging programme of regulatory reform. Under this programme, the Government has committed to removing existing regulation, reducing the volume of new regulation, and introducing new regulation only as a last resort. There is a real risk that an undue focus on de-regulation, rather than on a sensible process of regulatory reform, will undermine existing regulations and stymie the introduction of new regulations that are in the public interest. The RSPB has serious questions regarding the logic underlying some of the current Government’s “principles of regulation”. In particular, we are concerned that the current approach is little more than a drive for deregulation as a short-term solution to our economic problems, rather than an approach to better regulation for all. This has the potential to result in costly and avoidable environmental harm and risks seriously undermining environmental protection in the UK for many years to come. Policy choices should be based on a systematic evaluation of the evidence; no policy option should be ruled out without good reason and no approach should be favoured over any other approach without clear evidence as to its superior performance. &#xa0;The draft Deregulation Bill is just the latest step in the Government’s ongoing drive to remove “unnecessary” bureaucracy, a drive which is making sweeping changes to the way in which the natural environment is protected in this country.   It is against this deregulatory backdrop, where regulation is largely seen as a negative that must be removed, that the appropriateness of the current proposal to introduce a growth duty on non-economic regulators should be assessed. &#xa0;In terms of the environment, regulation provides vital protection for the UK’s threatened wildlife and important wildlife sites; regulations support many of the RSPB’s most important conservation work and provide the essential bedrock for biodiversity conservation in the UK.  More broadly, regulation is essential for a well-functioning market economy and it plays a central role in protecting the natural capital upon which the UK’s long-term prosperity and well-being ultimately depend. We view regulation as an essential policy tool for achieving protection of the natural environment and as a means of the UK meeting its legal obligations under EU Directives such as the Water Framework Directive and the Birds and Habitats Directives.  Regulatory approaches have a strong track record of securing and improving environmental quality and are important in ensuring businesses and the private sector act in a responsible and sustainable manner towards wildlife and natural resources. Few, if any, major environmental improvements in the UK have been achieved in the absence of regulation.&#xa0;However, in the UK, recent debates around regulation have focussed almost exclusively on the costs it places on business, while ignoring the evidence almost entirely on the benefits of regulation both for business, the environment, and wider society. &#xa0;In relation to costs, business and trade organisations frequently argue against most forms of regulation on the grounds that they impose an unacceptable burden and stymie investment or activity. However, there is increasing evidence that regulatory compliance costs, as presented by industry in the negotiation of some environmental regulations, are frequently overestimated. Firms clearly have an incentive to inflate the costs of compliance before legislation is agreed in an attempt to weaken the legislation and its anticipated impacts on a firm’s current activities.&#xa0;In relation to benefits, environmental protection can promote jobs and growth, stimulating innovation and creating new business opportunities. In the UK, a study on the ‘jobs versus the environment’ debate found that environmental regulation costs have do not have a statistically significant effect on employment and concluded that they could find no evidence of a trade-off between jobs and the environment. In fact, the evidence shows that, at least with regard to the environment, regulation has a benefit cost ratio of at least 2.4:1, while for biodiversity-related regulations the ratio is almost 9:1. According to Defra, “...it seems likely that this ratio may understate benefits compared to costs as.....some, not all of the benefits, have been assessed; whereas generally all or most of the costs have been monetised.”&#xa0;These findings are underlined by the ground-breaking 2011 UK National Ecosystems Assessment which clearly highlighted the wide variety of significant benefits provided by the natural environment in terms of economic prosperity, human health and well-being; the risks posed to the delivery of these benefits through inadequate protection and management of the natural environment; and, in particular, the importance of regulation in safeguarding and enhancing the delivery of key services.   &#xa0;We also believe there is a moral obligation to conserve

[[[ ]]]nature, which transcends its

[[[ ]]]direct value to humanity.  We note the findings of the NCC that “...when thinking about natural capital, wild species and habitats require special treatment that reflects their irreplaceability.” Many people believe that the nature has its own intrinsic value that cannot be traded off against purely economic values.  A 2010 Eurobarometer poll found that EU citizens (including in the UK) see the conservation of biodiversity first and foremost as moral obligation rather than as a means of protecting our own well-being and quality of life.

[[[. ]]]  &#xa0;The stated aim of the proposed growth duty, according to Business Minister Michael Fallon, is to “help bring the huge resource of more than 50 non-economic regulators with a combined budget of £4 billion to bear on the crucial task of stopping pointless red tape and promoting growth.”  As well as questioning the evidence base and rationale for this, we would also argue that, in fact, the work of many of these regulators does actually represent an important contribution to prosperity of the most fundamental kind: the protection of the natural world upon which the economy and our well-being ultimately depends. However, the positive impacts of environmental regulations are not always captured in existing measures of economic growth. In particular, we highlight the recent findings of the Government’s Natural Capital Committee (NCC), which clearly point out that currently our national accounts provide erroneous signals about future economic prospects, considerably overstating the sustainable growth rate.  According to the NCC, as long as growth is properly measured, “there is no inherent incompatibility between preserving and enhancing natural capital and economic growth”. It would not therefore be appropriate to introduce a growth duty without defining what the Government actually mean by growth.  &#xa0;We note the number of voices emerging from the private sector itself questioning the “perceived wisdom” in relation to environmental regulation and regulatory burden. For example, the Aldersgate Group states that “...there is no inherent contradiction between regulating for high environmental standards at the same time as maintaining economic competitiveness and stimulating wealth creation. Quite the reverse: no economic policy which sacrifices environmental quality can succeed in the long term...future economic prosperity and high environmental and social standards must go hand in hand.” &#xa0;

[[[Section 2: Answers to Specific Questions]]]&#xa0;

[[[3. Are the changes proposed in the draft Bill evidence-based and have any risks associated with the changes been taken adequately into account? ]]]The consultation “Non-economic Regulators: Duty to Have Regard to Growth” claimed that there is “a strong body of evidence that suggests that non-economic regulators are not consistently achieving both protection and prosperity in the way they operate”. The key evidence sources cited for this claim were (i) business perceptions survey data, (ii) the post-implementation review of the Regulators’ Compliance Code, and (iii) the preliminary findings of the Focus on Enforcement initiative. We assess each of these in turn below and find that the overall evidence base is very weak. We also question the finding that (iv) “there is evidence of the impact of regulatory delivery on business growth”.  The evidence for this assumption is found to be lacking. Overall, the changes proposed in the draft Bill in relation to the introduction of a growth duty are not evidence-based. 

[[[Note:]]] Issues in relation to risks associated with the introduction of a growth duty are dealt with in the section which relates specifically to the growth duty.

[[[(i)]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Business Perception Surveys]]]The growth duty consultation quotes evidence from the Business Perceptions Survey 2012 which suggests that “...businesses still see regulation as a barrier to growth”.

[[[ ]]]However,

[[[ ]]]businesses’ subjective perceptions are not a reliable indicator of the true regulatory burden to business and to society more generally and should not be used in isolation to inform government policy. The manifold weaknesses of perception surveys should be well known to Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS).  In 2009, a report to BIS by the Better Regulation Executive concluded that that “Perceptions [of regulation] appear to be often more grounded in emotion than rational thought.” The BRE report highlighted the existence of a considerable “perception-reality” gap in the UK.  These findings are supported by the OECD (2012) in a report suggesting that there may be a considerable disparity between perceptions of regulatory quality and their actual measurable results. In fact, the evidence suggests that “irritation” based on past experiences with regulation may have a greater influence on perceptions of the overall impact of regulation than actual measurable costs. This is despite the fact that “irritation factors” do not tend to be correlated with administrative burdens. It is just that irritating experiences tend to be more memorable. Overall, as highlighted by the OECD (2012) and BIS (2009), perception surveys invariably focus on costs and burdens, overlooking the benefits of regulation. Respondents to the 2012 Business Perceptions Survey (one of the key sources of information cited in the consultation) that identified themselves as “not informed” about regulation were more likely to state that there was “too much regulation” than those which described themselves as “informed”.&#xa0;We also question the disproportionate focus on business perceptions, without any consideration of the views of the intended beneficiaries of regulation i.e. consumers and citizens. Focusing on business views alone, a section of society with a short-term vested interest in looser regulations, is clearly not appropriate. Better regulation should be about maximizing the net benefit to society, not about minimising costs to business. Whilst businesses are clearly a key stakeholder group for BIS, there is a much wider range of stakeholders who would be closely affected by a growth duty, but whose views have not been fully represented.  In contrast to business, perceptions of regulation among the public tend to be relatively positive. According to BIS (2009) “Views [of the general public] were positive, surprisingly so in contrast to negativity in business surveys.”  &#xa0;Views about environmental regulation in particular in the UK are also strongly positive judging by the Government’s own crowd sourcing website (The Red Tape Challenge (RTC) website).  Responses to the first phase of the RTC were overwhelmingly in support of keeping existing environmental legislation as it currently stands, with the majority of respondents keen to ensure that existing environmental safeguards are maintained or even strengthened.   Only a tiny proportion of respondents felt that current legislation should be changed or scrapped.  This outcome was a public demonstration of the demand for the preservation and enforcement of environmental protection laws in the UK.

[[[Post-implementation Review of the Regulators’ Compliance Code ]]]It is difficult to fully evaluate the evidence provided via the post-implementation review as the summary of the findings presented is rather vague as to the methods/data sources used (primarily based on stakeholder views) and the results are primarily qualitative in nature. Nevertheless, an assessment of the key “findings” of relevance (in relation to the promotion of “economic progress”) suggests that the case for a new growth duty is weak.  &#xa0;We question the relevance of the finding that “the general view amongst regulators is that their primary role is to deliver protection for consumers, citizens and the environment, while supporting economic growth is a secondary function...where regulators are thinking about their role in regard to economic growth, their view often seems to be that this role is a subsidiary one that is at best contributory, rather than a direct stimulator to growth.” This is an entirely appropriate position for regulators to take. The primary duty of many regulators is

[[[ ]]]the protection of consumers, citizens, and the environment.  While we fully accept that regulators should consider the economic impacts of their actions, we do not accept that they should actively promote growth where this risks running counter to their core or primary remit to protect the public interest and/or the wider environment. For example, Natural England’s role in regard to economic growth is very much set out as contributory one; its statutory purpose is clearly to contribute to sustainable development through the protection, enhancement, and management of the natural environment.A second key finding of the post-implementation review was that “Businesses are not seen as customers” by most regulators. One of the aims of the growth duty is to “...enable regulators to regard businesses that wish to comply as clients, or even customers...” It is utterly inappropriate for regulated entities to be treated as “customers” by regulatory bodies. While we see no problem in the drive to make regulatory implementation more efficient and business friendly,  we are deeply concerned that a requirement on regulators to treat the entities that they regulate as “customers” risks creating a clear conflict-of-interest between “business needs” and the statutory purpose of regulatory bodies.  &#xa0;

[[[Focus on Enforcement (FOE) Initiative]]]The evidence base produced by the Focus on Enforcement (FOE) Initiative, a government website that allows anybody with an opinion on regulation to “have their say”about how the enforcement of regulation affects them, is also relatively weak as it is qualitative, limited to just a handful of sector-based reviews, and again is predominantly focussed on the business point-of-view. It seems possible that the set of sectors included may not represent an unbiased sample; in the FAQ section of the FOE website under the question “What criteria will you use when choosing further areas for review?” the answer includes “…evidence that inappropriate regulatory enforcement may be having a damaging impact on economic growth or other beneficial activity.” If this has been used as a criterion for selecting the sectors to assess, then we can hardly use the evidence collected via this process to conclude that regulators, at least in general, are failing to consider the impact of their decisions in terms of growth. 

[[[(iv)]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Regulation and Economic Growth ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Despite a number of limited, sector-specific examples, there is only a very weak evidence base to suggest a negative relationship between regulation and economic growth.  In relation to the environment, the scope of the literature review that is referenced in the growth duty consultation document was relatively limited with respect to the relationship between environmental regulation and growth, and therefore is of limited relevance to non-economic regulators such as NE that deal primarily with environmental regulations. According to the review, “The BRE limited the scope of the research by excluding financial regulation and indicating that environmental regulation is less of a priority as... [Defra] has commissioned a research project that deals specifically with environmental regulation and growth.” &#xa0;Nevertheless, the conclusion on environmental regulation reached by the review was that “the empirical evidence appears to be mixed and the outcome depends on the regulatory design and type of regulation.”  We await with interest the conclusions of the Defra review of environmental regulation and growth. However, we note the conclusions of a previous Defra review which concluded that, although there is some evidence of near-term trade-offs between environmental regulation and growth “these effects have typically been found to be small or even insignificant”.  In particular, “...empirical analyses have found environmental regulation to have a minor adverse impact, if any, on productivity...no survey has found large negative effects of environmental regulation on overall productivity, either in the short or in the long run.” In fact, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that, in the long-run, environmental regulation is good for business by opening up new market opportunities and driving cost-reducing innovation. Overall, very little, if any, convincing evidence has been presented to demonstrate that regulators are failing to promote growth in carrying out their regulatory functions. In contrast, there are plenty of examples of where an undue focus on business growth and reluctance to regulate has resulted in serious issues of non-compliance and regulatory failure. We are concerned that the growth duty will give further weight to the government’s regulatory principle of favouring “alternatives to regulation” and using regulation “as a last resort”. The evidence to support the effectiveness of non-regulatory voluntary approaches is scant. The recent financial crisis has highlighted the risks associated with focusing on short-term business growth at the expense of long-run economic sustainability, while lax regulatory controls and oversight of the industry were a key cause of the financial crisis that has resulted in the deepest economic slump in living memory. There are other examples too. Recently, firms in the payday lenders market have been shown to be poorly compliant with respect to their own self-regulatory “customer charter”, with the majority of industry pledges being broken.Additional examples of the failure of self-regulation are provided below:

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[17. To what extent do the Government’s existing powers of direction over regulators already provide the ability to guide regulators towards the importance of promoting economic growth? Is this legislation necessary? ]]]&#xa0;We do not believe that additional legislation is necessary; there are already sufficient statutory foundations (e.g. Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006) to address the concerns of Government and business on growth.  The proposed duty overlaps with a number of existing laws and policies that already gives the Government sufficient ability to ensure that environmental regulators give 

[[[due consideration]]] to economic issues. The consultation paper even acknowledges that many regulators are already subject to existing economic-related legal duties i.e. paragraph 1.9 "Existing duties do not always include the requirement to have regard to the economic consequences" (our emphasis).  As outlined below, these negate the need for a statutory duty. &#xa0;

[[[(i)]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Existing sustainable development duties]]]:&#xa0; In carrying out their regulatory function(s), many non-economic regulators (such as Natural England and the Environment Agency) are already subject to duties which require them to consider the economic impacts of their actions, particularly as part of the commonly found "sustainable development duty". Such duties already provides for due consideration to be given to growth and economic impacts. &#xa0;For example, Section 4(1) of the Environment Act 1995 makes it the Environment Agency’s ‘principal aim....in discharging its functions so as to protect or enhance the environment, taken as a whole, as to make the contribution towards attaining the objective of achieving sustainable development...’ The Agency is required to take into account any likely costs in achieving its principal aim, and to take account of the likely costs and benefits in exercising its powers. This includes both costs to people and organisations, and costs to the environment. As has been made clear by the Government's National Planning Policy Framework (paragraph 7), there are three dimensions to sustainable development: economic, social and environmental. &#xa0;Similarly, Natural England’s statutory purpose, as set out in the Natural Environment &amp; Rural Communities Act (NERC) 2006, Section 2(1) is ‘to ensure that the natural environment is conserved, enhanced and managed for the benefit of present and future generations, thereby contributing to sustainable development.’ This purpose makes it clear that Natural England is already obliged to consider (or have regard to) economic factors in carrying out its statutory duties via its contribution to “sustainable development”. &#xa0;From a purely legal perspective, unless the Government is proposing a duty which puts economic issues ahead of environmental or social considerations, a new duty is not necessary.&#xa0;

[[[(ii)]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[The 2007 Regulators Compliance Code]]]:&#xa0;Most non-economic regulators already have a statutory duty “to have regard to” the Regulators’ Compliance Code when determining policies and principles and/or exercising regulatory functions. The Code’s provisions in relation to economic progress state that “Regulators should consider the impact that their regulatory interventions may have on economic progress...they should only adopt a particular approach if the benefits justify the costs and it entails the minimum burden compatible with achieving their objectives [where costs and benefits include economic, social and environmental costs and benefits].” This Code provides the Government with sufficient powers of direction over regulators, thus rendering a growth duty unnecessary.

[[[  ]]]Although the effectiveness of this code has been questioned, the evidence base is again weak.

[[[ ]]]&#xa0;The existing code is likely to be replaced by a new “Regulators’ Code” in&#xa0;Spring 2014. This new code was published in July 2013 following a consultation, ‘Amending the Regulators’ Compliance Code’, which ran from March 8th to May 3rd 2013. This new code will also require regulators to “carry out their activities in a way that supports those they regulate to comply and grow”.  We note here

[[[ ]]]a number of contentious issues with the proposed new Regulators’ Code as it currently stands, particularly in relation to the promotion of economic “progress”. The new code places greater emphasis on the proactive promotion of business growth than the existing code, which takes a more balanced approach. The new code requires regulators to actively “support or enable” growth, whereas the existing code requires regulators to “consider” the economic consequences of their actions. The existing code also makes it clear that any attempt to minimize regulatory costs must be compatible with achieving regulatory objectives, a requirement that is not made explicit in the new code. It is also clear that the new code takes a narrower view of growth, focusing on business growth at the expense of considering economic progress in a broader sense. Government needs to explain why they consider business costs on a par with wider economic benefits to society.&#xa0;

[[[18. Will the introduction of a duty to have ]]]

[[[regard]]]

[[[ to “promoting economic growth” compromise the independence of regulators? What additional safeguards are required to ensure that the introduction of such a duty will not compromise the independence of a regulator?]]]See response to question 19 below

[[[19. How is a duty to have regard to the desirability of economic growth likely to affect those regulators to which it is applied?]]]The introduction of a growth duty risks damaging the regulatory integrity of non-economic regulators and fundamentally undermining their independence and their ability to fulfil their primary statutory duties or functions. This question is answered in relation to Natural England, the independent executive non-departmental public body whose purpose is to protect and improve England’s natural environment. Although we have been unable to consider all the existing duties/purposes of the various regulators that are likely to be subject to the proposed duty, we expect that it is highly likely that the duty will compromise the independence and effectiveness of many of these regulators.&#xa0;Natural England’s “general purpose”, as set out in the Natural Environment &amp; Rural Communities Act (NERC) 2006, Section 2(1) is “to ensure that the natural environment is conserved, enhanced and managed for the benefit of present and future generations, thereby contributing to sustainable development.” This purpose is clear in prescribing the specific manner in which Natural England is to contribute to sustainable development i.e. through the conservation, enhancement, and management of the natural environment. The word thereby is crucial. Protection of the natural environment is the clear priority. Natural England 

[[[must]]] have a clear focus on conserving and enhancing the natural environment. Indeed, it is by focussing its necessary expertise on these environmental objectives that Natural England can make its most meaningful contribution to sustainable development.

[[[ ]]]We strongly believe that, while any champion for the natural environment such as Natural England should be expected to have regard to economic and social objectives and should see their role as supporting prosperity as well as protection, they should not be expected to have these as primary objectives. &#xa0;This is crucial because, while recognising the economic benefits of protecting natural capital, there will be many instances when the necessary action (often legally required) for the natural environment will not necessarily yield maximum economic benefits. Natural England’s statutory purpose is clear in this regard. In situations where the need to protect may conflict with promoting growth, their primary duty should continue to be the protection of the environment. Natural England should not be required to give equal weight to social, economic, and environmental factors. In their own response to the growth duty consultation, Natural England stated that: “If this new duty were introduced, it could conflict with our duty to promote sustainable development.” They also noted that it could lead to greater business costs and conflict.

[[[ We believe that introducing a growth duty risks undermining Natural England’s primary objective and its vital work that underpins our long-term economic prosperity.]]]&#xa0;One of Natural England’s key roles as an expert statutory agency is to give clear advice on the environmental implications of developments or other proposals.  It is fundamentally important that Natural England can act as an independent adviser, providing expertise on the natural environment to decision-making bodies.  It then becomes the role of the decision maker (i.e. planning/competent authority) to weigh up this advice alongside other advice it may receive on socio-economic issues. In this way, growth-related issues are fully taken into account by the decision maker. Natural England must be able to inform evidence-based policy, and deliver its implementation, based on sound science. They must also be able to take a long-term perspective that transcends short-term politics. It is vital that, where disparity arises between Natural England’s general purpose and the Government’s short-term aims and priorities, Natural England be able to retain its independence and carry out its regulatory functions as prescribed under the relent legislation outlining said functions. Government rightly has a much wider remit than Natural England. However, if the intention is for Natural England to support Government aims that sit outside Natural England’s remit, this would be a clear breach of its statutory duties. If the public are to feel confident that the natural environment is being conserved and enhanced for future generations, they need to know that there is an independent agency that is free from political interference, or requirements to boost short-term economic growth. 

[[[There is a serious risk ]]]

[[[that the introduction of a duty to have regard to promoting economic growth will compromise the independence of Natural England.]]] &#xa0;Overall, there is a clear risk that a growth duty might undermine the independence of Natural England and weaken or dilute their focus on conserving and enhancing the natural environment. We are concerned that attempts to erode Natural England’s independence and focus on the natural environment, coupled with considerable resource pressures, and are beginning to have a negative effect on what they are able to deliver. &#xa0;Although we are opposed to the introduction of a growth duty on non-economic regulators, should such a duty be imposed, the risk of potential adverse consequences could be partly reduced through the provision of clear guidance on implementation, which would need to be subject to further consultation. Such guidance would need to make it clear that the primary statutory duties of non-economic regulators must take precedence over the proposed growth duty, and that growth must be environmentally and socially sustainable and compatible with the achievement of regulatory outcomes at least cost. If a duty is imposed, we believe that regulators should be given considerable flexibility in meeting its requirements. This is necessary in order to reflect the broad range of regulators to which it may apply and to avoid undermining the existing primary legislative duties to which said regulators are subject. &#xa0;

[[[20. Where is the introduction of such a duty likely to have beneficial effect? Where might there be adverse consequences? ]]]We start with outlining the potential benefits to the private sector from the growth duty, followed by an assessment of the environmental risks/adverse consequences. &#xa0;

[[[(i)]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Beneficial Effects]]]&#xa0;The way the duty is framed suggests that it is unlikely to improve regulatory outcomes. In relation to benefits for business, the consultation documented provided no satisfactory evidence that a growth duty would reduce costs to business or remove/address barriers to growth. Therefore, we conclude that the introduction of such a duty is unlikely to have beneficial effects. &#xa0;As recommended by the Hampton Review (2005), we agree that there is scope for regulatory reform aimed at reducing the administrative cost to business of regulatory compliance through the avoidance of duplication and unnecessary regulatory complexity and through exploiting smarter means of data capture and transfer at the same time as “maintaining or improving regulatory outcomes”.  However, we do not believe that a growth duty is the appropriate mechanism for dealing with these particular administrative costs.  &#xa0;In relation to the broader relationship between regulation and growth, we note that the focus must be on compliant growth. However, the available evidence is that regulation is not a brake on economic growth, a burden on British business or a barrier to international competitiveness. The UK is widely regarded as having one of the most favourable regulatory environments for doing business in the world. According to the Frontier Economics Report commissioned by The Better Regulation Executive (BRE), the benefits to growth in reducing the level of regulation are large for highly regulated countries but diminish with lower levels of existing regulation. As the UK is among the top deregulated countries in the world, any additional impacts are likely to be limited/marginal, suggesting that the proposed growth duty is unlikely to deliver many additional “benefits” for business. Businesses themselves recognise that currently the greatest challenge to running a business is attracting and retaining customers (54%) followed by accessing finance (15%). In other words, it is the tough economic climate and problems in gaining access to credit that are holding back business growth, not environmental regulation per se. In fact, the costs of environmental regulations are typically a small fraction of industry turnover. For example, the direct cost of Defra’s regulations account for 0.2% of annual manufacturing industry turnover, and 0.1% of annual construction industry turnover. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[(ii)]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Adverse Effects]]]&#xa0;There is clear potential for adverse consequences arising from the introduction of the proposed duty. Assigning a duty to promote growth to non-economic regulators, alongside their existing regulatory duties, is likely to reduce their overall effectiveness. As noted already the proposed growth duty risks fundamentally undermining the independence and primary role/key statutory function of a number of non-economic regulators by placing undue weight on the importance of promoting economic growth. We, alongside others, noted in our response to the initial consultation that such a statutory duty could detract from regulators’ core statutory obligations. Although the Government has made it clear that the growth duty should no override regulators’ existing duties, it is also clear that the growth duty is supposed  “provide a clear imperative for regulators to factor economic considerations into the way they undertake their regulatory functions, given that their role is to support prosperity as well as to protect.” Due consideration has not been given to the risks associated with introducing the duty, particularly in relation to the protection of the natural environment. For example, one worrying interpretation of the “growth duty” as currently proposed would make it harder for non-economic regulators to refuse environmentally-damaging developments, including those that threaten nationally-important wildlife sites, even if the overall societal benefits of doing so are greater. More generally, a duty based on an ill defined notion of growth runs the risk of actually undermining future economic prosperity if it undermines the fundamental rationale for which regulation was introduced.  The positive impacts of regulations (e.g. in terms of health and safety, environmental quality etc.) are not always captured in conventional measures of economic growth.  The current wording of the duty does not adequately reflect evidence about the social and economic value of the natural environment and the need to value it accordingly in decision making. A short term increase in monetary activity by one business which comes at the cost of depleting natural capital upon which future business prosperity depends both increases and decreases ‘growth’ simultaneously.  Short-term decisions based solely on what can be measured in economic terms may prove costly in the long term. For example, despite the growth of agricultural production in recent decades, these gains have had negative impacts on other ecosystems and ecosystem services which have not been properly accounted for.  These increases in production have been associated with changes in habitats and major declines in the diversity and numbers of plants, terrestrial invertebrates and vertebrates in agricultural areas. For example, the Farmland Bird Index – a measure of the state of biodiversity on agricultural lands – declined by 43% between 1970 and 1998. Over the last decade, the UK has produced more food per year from crops than at any other time in history. However, over the same time period we have witnessed declines in many of the ecosystem services associated with the farmed environment. These changes are rarely accounted for by measures of economic growth.&#xa0;One way of minimizing the risk of such adverse consequences occurring is to ensure that any guidance with respect to the growth duty must make it clear that it will not be “desirable” to promote growth in those situations where such growth risks undermining the protection of the natural environment. &#xa0;A more appropriate goal for a “growth” duty would be to focus on “sustainable” growth. Government plays a key role in helping to make development more sustainable through the regulatory and policy frameworks they put in place. Following its commitment to be the greenest government ever, in February 2011, the Government published its vision for mainstreaming sustainable development. The Coalition Government announced its intention to move sustainable development beyond being considered as a separate, ‘green’ issue which is a priority for only a few government departments, and to embed it within governance, policy making, and operations. This document made it clear that the Government is committed to sustainable development (SD), where sustainable development refers to the three interconnected ‘pillars’ of the economy, society and the environment. Central to this vision, the Government stated that it wanted to “...mainstream SD so that it is central to the way we make policy...”, and to “ensure SD is at the heart of each Government department”. &#xa0;However, the absence of any mention of sustainable growth in the text of the deregulation bill makes it clear that the Government is failing to live up to this vision. We do not believe it to be appropriate that regulators be required to promote economic growth over and above the other two pillars of sustainable development. Therefore, the growth duty should either be amended or scrapped.  &#xa0;According to the government’s consultation document, the proposed duty “...will be a duty on regulators to support growth in the process of exercising their functions at the level of individual businesses and in the provision of support to business communities and industry sectors.”  We are extremely concerned by the suggestion that regulators would be required to support the growth at the level of individual businesses as well as at the sector level.  It is not the role of the regulator to support the growth aspirations of individual businesses or sectors. There is a real risk that such an approach will lead to regulatory capture i.e. i.e. “the process by which vested interests bias the incentives of regulators to act in their interests rather than the broader public interest” A lack of regulator independence, combined with the imposition of multiple general duties, could result in considerable regulatory risk.. Many OECD countries seek to limit the risk of regulatory capture by ensuring that regulatory institutions are independent from the executive branch of government, thus limiting the risk that private sector lobbies may use their political influence to affect regulatory decisions. Given the strong financial incentives facing profit-maximizing firms to convince regulators of their need to grow, it seems prudent to be especially cautious in this area regarding the role and independence of regulators. OECD (2012) highlights the importance of regulatory agencies being independent from government and from those it regulates, particularly in situations where the potential for regulatory capture is high.&#xa0;

[[[21. How might the extent to which a regulator has fulfilled, or breached, the duty be ascertained?]]]&#xa0;If a duty is imposed, regulators should be given considerable flexibility in meeting its requirements. This is necessary in order to reflect the broad range of regulators to which it may apply and to avoid undermining the existing primary legislative duties to which said regulators are subject.&#xa0;Assessing compliance with the duty should not be ascertained via the use of subjective business perception surveys; such surveys are not an acceptable source of information upon which to base an assessment of regulators’ compliance with the duty. Regulators’ compliance with the duty should be assessed in combination with an assessment of overall regulatory outcomes; it is essential that any improvement in the growth “prospects” of regulated firms is not achieved at the expense of existing regulatory standards. Compliant growth must be the objective against which performance is assessed.  Regulatory standards must be maintained or enhanced at the same time as improving business performance. &#xa0;It is also important to note the potential for additional monitoring and reporting requirements to result in additional administrative burden on the regulators associated with the new duty. We believe that scarce regulatory resources should be targeted at improving regulatory outcomes for society as a whole, rather than focussed on minimising “burdens” on business. Natural England should be allowed to focus on using their resources to deliver their primary objective in relation to the conservation, enhancement, and management of the natural environment. In its response to the consultation, Natural England noted that “...the introduction of a new duty could result in extra resource-intensive data collection and record maintenance” and hence would “add significant resource and cost burden to Natural England”.&#xa0;
