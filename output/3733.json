A critical mechanism is the quarterly accountability meetings, chai\nr\ned by the SDS and attended by the Chief Executive of PHE and other DH and PHE Directors;\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nt\nhe SDS is supported by a DH Sponsor Team, who is the principal day-to-day \nliaison between the DH and PHE;\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPHE must obtain and publish, at least annually, updated information for each local authority against the Public Health Outcomes Framework in order to give DH a clear account of progress;\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPHE shall publish and lay before Parliament an annual report \nwhich \ndescrib\nes \nperformance against objectives and its use of public funds\n including assurance that local authorities are discharging their financial obligations to improve health and wellbeing in their communities\n.\n \nThe report shall reflect the views of external agencies and stakeholders who have dealings with PHE, including local government and the NHS.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOperational Autonomy&#xa0;\n“\nMy noble friend is anxious for Public Health England to be and to be seen to be a trusted and impartial champion for the protection of the health of the people and free to provide advice based firmly on the science and the evidence. So are we.”\n&#xa0;\n“It will be essential for it and the Government to work together seamlessly and to share the same objectives. Anything less could severely limit the Secretary of State's capacity to undertake his statutory duty.”\n&#xa0;\n“Public Health England will of course be its own master as regards the research that it undertakes, and it will be operationally independent, as I emphasised earlier.”\n&#xa0;\n“My noble friend Lady Cumberlege asked me whether PHE will be able to give professional advice freely to the public. We expect it to do precisely that, in much the same way that the Chief Medical Officer already does. It will be good practice for PHE and the department to consult each other about communications on public health matters, but with a view to agreeing the content, not censoring it. PHE data will be subject to the code of practice on official statistics, which severely restricts access to certain material by Ministers or officials before it is published. Within three years of PHE becoming operational we will undertake a review of its governance to ensure that it is entirely appropriate and effective\n.”\n&#xa0;Progress&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFuture Challenges&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nConclusion&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDepartment of HealthOctober 2013&#xa0;\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/framework-agreement-between-the-department-of-health-and-public-health-england\n&#xa0;\n \nThe Chair and non-executive members are appointed by the Secretary of State for Health.\n \nDH and PHE are currently in the process of recruiting two more non-executive members.\n"
