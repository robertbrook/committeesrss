[[[ Oakley [PHS0035]]]]&#xa0;http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/health-board-criticised-care-dying-1858019&#xa0;Since my complaint against&#xa0; LHB&#xa0; about my father's sad death (above) was upheld by the Ombudsman,&#xa0; I've been struggling along in the system to read the two remaining documents in my father’s file, in which I am apparently named.&#xa0;Private Eye have printed two articles on my case, one last&#xa0; August.&#xa0;At present, I've been regurgitated by the PHSO&#xa0; - after my case was out forward by my MP David Davies - with a metaphorical paperwork clip round the ear, as its communication isn't exactly user-friendly.&#xa0;&#xa0;So,&#xa0; having to fight my case, as an ex-journalist I did some research into the PHSO.&#xa0;As I see that&#xa0; you are&#xa0; on the committee, I thought that you might be interested in some statistics and&#xa0; I might be in with a chance that you might actually read it.&#xa0;Comparative Ombudsman Costs:&#xa0;&#xa0;UK PHSOCANADA (Ontario)CANADA (BC)NEW ZEALANDAnnual Cost£32m£7m£3.3m£4.4mCases referred per year26,96119,726743110,636Investigations3841,2191,674452Percentage of Cases investig’d1.46.1224.2Employees435864664Single Investigated case cost£83,333£5742£1870£9734&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;SWEDENAUSTRALIA (NSW)HONG KONGDENMARKAnnual Cost£7.4m£15m£7.7m£6.2mCases referred per year694033,35355014853Investigations76493262285875Percentage of Cases investig’d11284118Employees7218611186Single Investigated case cost£9685£1608£3369£7805&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Ours is run by a business woman.&#xa0;I see the others which are much more cost effective,&#xa0;&#xa0; all seem to be run by trained lawyers.&#xa0;:::::&#xa0;The other thing that I've done is to almost write a helpful guide to NHS complainants for phsothefacts website .. An anti-PHSO group.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Helpful Hints for Bereaved complainants going through the NHS Complaints System&#xa0;&#xa0; You witnessed negligence, your relative died a sad and difficult death, but be warned,&#xa0; as you emerge from&#xa0; the funeral service .....these forces are already aligned against you.&#xa0;Health Boards&#xa0;1. The medical staff, who lie, as they wish to keep their jobs.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Human nature really. Who could complain?&#xa0;..Well, you could.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Because 'complain' is what the NHS says that you are doing -&#xa0; even if you just want to know what happened, who was to blame and stop it happening to anyone else.&#xa0;From that point on, think if yourself as a target.&#xa0;Should you choose the Complaint system?&#xa0;If you don't sue, and trustingly take your case through the Ombudsman, you will be badly out of pocket. So, if you are poor, don't bother.&#xa0;Because,&#xa0; even if your case is upheld, it will end up on some obscure website. Which nobody reads.... Well, maybe you.&#xa0;Even worse, nobody is held accountable and the names of those negligent are not included in the final report. They will be free to carry on regardless&#xa0; in their careers. And you will be able to see those ultimately responsible happily in ever better-paid NHS jobs.&#xa0;This is because the Ombudsman only has the power to recommend change and cannot hold the authority to account.&#xa0;Faint criticism&#xa0;In effect, the Ombudsman's power is to&#xa0; say: 'Tut'.Sometimes, a very cross&#xa0; Ombudsman even raises his/ her game to a:&#xa0;'Tsk, tsk,&#xa0;&#xa0;For this small outcome -&#xa0; and going it alone without a lawyer -&#xa0; you could&#xa0; face:&#xa0;*&#xa0; Disbelief&#xa0; of everything that you didn't happen to photograph*&#xa0; Personal criticism as to your motivations*&#xa0; Being played by professional NHS game players*&#xa0; Be ignored*&#xa0; Being lied to and lied about*&#xa0; Shouted at by the more aggressive caseworkers*&#xa0; And, eventually,&#xa0; possibly years later, and having clawed your way up to the top rung of the complaints ladder...arrogantly dismissed, without explanation.&#xa0;The plus&#xa0;On the plus side, the board chief executive could be embarrassed enough to make some improvements for patients if your case has been covered in the press.&#xa0;&#xa0;2. The complaints person - whilst simultaneously making soothing noises to you, promptly relays your complaint to an external professional&#xa0;company, employed to defend the NHS and advise the Board on how make you go away.&#xa0;&#xa0;Tactics&#xa0;A common tactic by complaints persons is to answer their own questions....whilst ignoring yours. This strategy will be repeated at every stage of your journey.&#xa0;So get used to it....and expect&#xa0; it. It's designed to annoy you enough in the sincere hope that you will&#xa0; go away - so that any NHS negligent death care can just carry on unnoticed as before.&#xa0;&#xa0;Example:Q. 'Who has authority over the deceased's body?'A. 'In answer to your question:....Enclosed you will find our guide to the mortuary temperatures and gurneys'.&#xa0;&#xa0;Paperwork ping-pong.&#xa0;The complaints person will try and fob&#xa0; you off by ping-ponging your requests for information in an attempt to tire you out.&#xa0;Don't be tempted to tear up letters which say:&#xa0; 'I hope this has been helpful' after you have even been driven to using a magnifying glass in the vain hope of finding any tiny thing of help.&#xa0;Just laugh at this cynical&#xa0; double-speak with the rest of the complainants, amongst whom it is now notorious.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Health Boards can also legally withhold crucial files - which you may never know exist -&#xa0; if they assess it in your 'best interests'&#xa0; not to receive them.&#xa0;Nb For 'your best interests' read 'their best interests'.&#xa0;If you argue that certain files must logically exist and you are legally entitled to them&#xa0; ...they may be suddenly found with an apologetic note on 'photocopying errors'.&#xa0; Or they have suddenly 'gone missing'.&#xa0;It's no use asking why important details have been changed ..ie time of death..with no counter-signature,&#xa0; because everything will be put down to a 'paperwork error'.&#xa0;Seemingly a 'paperwork error' is a get-out-of-jail card for all medical negligence.As it is the board's strategy is to be blamed by 'Tut' for 'substandard paperwork', rather than 'Tsk, Tsk'd'&#xa0; for medical negligence.&#xa0;&#xa0;Legal knowledge is necessary&#xa0;The key here is to know that you might eventually get the files/answers, by extreme perseverance, around the six month mark.&#xa0;However, if you are not an expert in the Access to Health Records Act, Freedom of Information Act and Data Protection Act and gave to learn about such things, your work hours will&#xa0; increase on this low estimate.&#xa0;&#xa0;This complexity makes it almost impossible for you to avoid employing a lawyer.Clever compo-seekers will have gone this route from the start.&#xa0;&#xa0;The Health Board hopes that you can't afford one.&#xa0;Because you are grieving, nice and still trying to understand what went wrong and don't want to sue anyone...&#xa0;Unfortunately,&#xa0; the board sees the sign invisible which reads: SUCKER!&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;ReviewEvery time you get a quarter-answer to your request you may be so bold as put your request for information into Review.&#xa0;The Review takes up yet more of&#xa0; your teeth-gritting time.&#xa0;But obviously&#xa0; it makes work for the NHS senior officers, who have completed the Advanced Gobbledegook course and are advised by private contractors,&#xa0;&#xa0; You may not understand the result of your Missing Information Review.... But,&#xa0; then again, you are not supposed to. So don't feel a failure if the reply is totally incomprehensible.&#xa0;You’re supposed to give up, as you are a defeated bereaved person who cannot cope with your grief and constantly being played by the Health Board at the same time.&#xa0;Your work Hours: ( If you already partly understand the Acts)&#xa0; : 22If you don't and have to learn from scratch and research cases etc&#xa0; - 40 hours.&#xa0;Paperwork pile: 6 inches..But 8 inches , if you include basic legal research.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;3. The complaints company,&#xa0; which is on a contract with the NHS and whose continued employment is dependent on getting&#xa0; rid of your complaint and also may advising withholding&#xa0; files legally due to you to do so.&#xa0;You will probably never know they exist. Everything they do is private and protected by law. And yet they are able&#xa0; to write comments about you on the NHS file.&#xa0;Anything they like..... True, untrue..libellous. What they think your motivations are.What they think you ate for breakfast, or how your sex life is..you will never know.&#xa0;Health Boards increasingly farm out work to private companies..Even in a proven case of medical negligence their contribution remains secret.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;4. The chief nursing officer, who will always defend the medical staff and disbelieve the complainant - as he/she also has a very well paid job to defend.&#xa0;&#xa0; And that job is:&#xa0; Chief Nursing Officer (God).&#xa0;&#xa0;He/she may imply that you are lying and construct their own reality of the scene both you and your family have witnessed.And this cannot be contradicted - being written by what is considered an immaculate being within the NHS.&#xa0;Any summary of CNO( God)'s&#xa0; opinion will be so couched in approval of staff you know to be negligent,&#xa0; you can dismiss it. Because, even with your limited medical knowledge,&#xa0; you will be able to see that it's unbelievably biased.&#xa0;Your work Hours: 36 .. Sudden&#xa0; increase by having to learn and check medical terms.Paperwork pile: 13 inches -&#xa0; more, if still grappling with legal stuff.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;5. The chief executive - who may ask all the right questions -&#xa0;&#xa0; if smart.&#xa0;But&#xa0; will believe the chief nursing officer as he/she hasn't a clue as to what to do otherwise and has to write lots of reports on 'Care and Dignity'&#xa0; and about how well the board is doing. And, in particular, the CEO.&#xa0;Then rush off to reorganise ... Well...everything.&#xa0;This is a permanent state. Until the next chief executive arrives to reorganise again and write more reports snappily entitled&#xa0; 'Dignity and Care'.&#xa0;CEO correspondence is&#xa0; fruitless anyway.&#xa0;Your work Hours: 36.5Paperwork pile:&#xa0; Remains just over 13 inches.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Nb. A small tip as to the general competence of a Health Board...&#xa0;...Ask how many reports it has with 'Care' and 'Dignity' in their titles.The higher the number, the less likely it is&#xa0; that there will be either generally available.&#xa0;&#xa0;:::::&#xa0;The Ombudsman&#xa0;1. The complaint handler/ caseworker, whose intelligence can range from the level of a dim - but arrogant - call centre operative, who likes to shout a bit at callers, to that of a reasonably understanding person.&#xa0;How your&#xa0; case goes will depend entirely on your luck in the caseworker draw and not how just it is.&#xa0;Complainants are advised to repeat the same thing (as in parrot training)&#xa0; in the hope that the exact nature if the complaint can be repeated by caseworker to the clinical advisor ....even though actual understanding of content might be absent.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;2. The clinical advisor&#xa0;.... Who either might be an NHS zealot , arrogant enough to make a diagnosis contradicting both&#xa0; deceased patient's GP and the doctor who signed the death certificate.&#xa0;&#xa0;....Or a person who wants to do a good job ...but keeps making incisive comments like :&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 'Why wasn't this patient on The Liverpool Care Pathway?'&#xa0;But missing the major fact that a patient has had neither food or fluid for a day.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;It is up to you to read and re-read the files detailing your relatives dying moments and point this out.&#xa0; You will cry a lot.&#xa0;But keep pointing out all the unanswered - but central - questions.....even those complicated medical&#xa0; and legal&#xa0; ones that you only partly understand.&#xa0;When you do, in retrospect, you will be&#xa0; (technical term here...)&#xa0; 'truly gobsmacked'&#xa0; at what has been missed.&#xa0;Your work Hours: 45Paperwork pile:&#xa0; 20+inches&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The PHSO&#xa0;If there was a government cup for 'Being Extremely Useless and Expensive'&#xa0; ..this organisation would win hands down.&#xa0;(Yes, that's even including a late challenge by the UK Border Agency, which has now been allocated an entire class of its own).&#xa0;The PHSO relies on the well-known fact that inept shouty caseworkers and frankly weird clinical advisors at stage 2&#xa0; are never wrong.&#xa0; And that 98.6 percent success rate by the Ombudsman in investigating cases is easily achievable every year.&#xa0;Stats never lie:&#xa0;*&#xa0; The PHSO&#xa0; only investigates 1.4 percent of the complainant cases recommended to it by MP's, who are the only people allowed to refer complaints to the PHSO.&#xa0;*&#xa0; The PHSO costs taxpayers&#xa0; £32m a year.&#xa0;*&#xa0; Arrogance rating : Off-the-scale percent. Nuclear winter communication style.&#xa0;So, having struggled through the system -&#xa0; sadly bereaved, becoming enraged and now simply flabbergasted -&#xa0; do not take this final rejection slip personally.&#xa0;&#xa0;What were the chances? You would have only&#xa0; been in a marginally better position if you had posted your complaint down a drain.&#xa0;However, for eternal optimists who simply must:&#xa0;1. The caseworker who 'reads' your complaint.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This person may not get:&#xa0;*&#xa0; your name right&#xa0;*&#xa0; the correct legal Act/s involved&#xa0;*&#xa0; or, most shockingly, what you are complaining about.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Despite being hampered by this creative lack of concentration, the caseworker is entrusted with a large rubber stamp....which reads 'W'.&#xa0;( For Wastepaper bin,&#xa0; of course..shame on those that thought anything else).&#xa0;&#xa0;The caseworker can happily consign your case to the bin for a reason that you cannot possibly comprehend.... as it is astonishingly one that you haven't complained about. Simply because the Ombudsman's decision is final.&#xa0;You will hope to get a letter which explains why your case was rejected.Hope on.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The PHSO does not have to explain its reasoning to a mere prole like you.If it did, you might be able to ask why it peremptorily dismissed your case, as, if an explanation was given,&#xa0; it may seem that your case&#xa0; had been inadvertently mixed up with someone else's and the explanation made no sense.&#xa0;&#xa0;So you may never know...Unless if course, you are prepared to start all over again on the ultra-masochistic Freedom of Information/Data Protection request paper trail.Reread strategies to 'withhold information'&#xa0; and 'dismissal of anyone who is chippy enough to ask about our private government business' tactics above ).&#xa0;&#xa0;Don't be dispirited that the old ploy of&#xa0; simply not answering your question ....but answering the one they'd wished you'd asked...&#xa0; is used. Yet again.&#xa0;There are some fine examples of this on the 'What Do They Know'&#xa0;website if you are in the mood for laughing and groaning simultaneously. Removal of tight garments is advised for your own protection.&#xa0;&#xa0;Nb. * Don't forget to ask for handwritten notes. The PHSO forgets to include them.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Q. How many of the letters that are addressed specifically to Dame Julie Mellor, does she read herself?&#xa0;&#xa0;A As we receive a great many enquiries each year (in 2012/13, we received 26,961), it would not be possible to extract this information for you without exceeding the appropriate limit as set out at section 12 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000.&#xa0;&#xa0;This example, now used as compulsory training for all would-be complainants:&#xa0;https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/dame_julie_mellor#incoming-433572&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;2. The Review Team&#xa0;As the Review team just sign stuff off and don't&#xa0; bother to read the files and so are simply unaware if what you complained about ... let alone understand it, it is a complete waste of time appealing to it.&#xa0;NbDon't bother complaining about any member of this team, as your complaint goes&#xa0; back to ....and is run by: (You've guessed it..) The Review Team.&#xa0;The PHSO has no ethics officer as its staff are all trusted to get everything at least 100 percent , which, if course is better than the&#xa0;98.6 percent that the previous Ombudsman was able to achieve.&#xa0;&#xa0;3. The Ombudsman&#xa0;This semi-mythical creature, is hardly ever sighted&#xa0; by complainants and exists only in places of power.&#xa0;&#xa0;It is no use appealing to her office for sense, as bereaved complainants might be savagely put in their place by a braying henchwoman.&#xa0;Nb. It is more difficult to be informed the Ombudsman's timetable than it is to get the HRH, Her Majesty the Queen's.&#xa0;In fact, it is rumoured that, statistically,&#xa0; a bereaved complainant might as well write to the Queen as they would be more likely to get a signed invite to a garden party, at Buckingham Palace, than a meeting with the Ombudsman.&#xa0;&#xa0; (* MP's note: This means you too).&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Time taken:&#xa0; About four yearsPaper pile:&#xa0; Leaning Tower of Pisa standard.&#xa0;End result:&#xa0;*&#xa0; Refurbishment of hospital ward. Now the dying have single&#xa0; rooms to die in and&#xa0; the nursing standards seem to be a lot higher.&#xa0;* Private companies are still able to write exactly what they like about people on NHS files - even though they may not even be the patient - if the complainant chooses the Ombudsman route.&#xa0;People may not know:&#xa0;*who is writing about them*why they have written it* or what it says.&#xa0;&#xa0;The 'public interest'&#xa0; argument is not even worth being considered by the PHSO as one which overrides the secrecy&#xa0; of private companies -&#xa0; which may wish to withhold crucial files to protect the NHS,&#xa0; and even retain their lucrative contracts on the basis of doing so - even in proven Ombudsman- upheld negligence cases.&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;
