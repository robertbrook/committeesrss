defaultWritten submission from FUSE Services Ltd (BRC 53)default&#xa0;
defaultWe are a 2 man electrical contracting company, registered with NAPIT. We want to undertake a professional installation every time but are up against those who want to do the job as quickly and cheaply
default as possible for maximum profit, and if that’s dangerous or has a short lifespan so be it.
default&#xa0;
defaultThey are using the public’s ignorance to achieve this.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe public are completely unaware of a competent 
defaultperson’s
default scheme.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe public have still no idea of what Part-
defaultP means, and I have been asked why we don’t have a Full-P
default instead?
default&#xa0;
defaultNo domestic customer has heard of the NICEIC or NAPIT or ECA etc…. they are just letters 
defaultrepresenting words that they have no idea of.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhen
default I’m 
default trying to offer explanation, they often quot
defaulte the “GasSafe” scheme for gas which they are very aware of.
default&#xa0;
defaultI think this is because they know gas is dangerous and they cannot go out and buy gas components. There have been many incidents on films and soaps that are part of everyday life that highlight t
defaulthe dangers of competence with gas.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis clearly demonstrates that not only the public but film directors and story writers are writing into their soaps what they too are personally aware of.
default Gas yes, electricity no.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere seems nothing about electrical saf
defaultety and using incompetent persons in this trade. The public are quite happy to employ the cheapest electrician. I often get, “He’s a nice bloke”. They are prepared to let kitchen fitters undertake electrical work and this area is supposed to be controlled 
defaultbeing the one place in the property where all the high current appliances are located and in my experience where almost 95% of faults are found.
default Part-P is now actually encouraging kitchen fitters into the trade which is disgusting.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe electricians in my a
defaultrea
default,
default particularly two of them ARE Part-P Registered, are members of NICEIC and NAPIT, and they STILL trade to a very dangerous level when the scheme operators are not around.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe scheme operators only see the contractor once a year. They collect the member
default’
defaults money once a year BEFORE the inspection is carried out. It’s all over within half an hour and we carry on regardless!
default&#xa0;
defaultI HAVE reported a bad contractor to the NICEIC and as a competent person myself they will NOT accept my complaint, saying it has to com
defaulte from the customer. Unfortunately the 
defaultcustomer is always fearful of reprisal and not sure if the work really is bad or not, as long as it works they are happy.
default&#xa0;
defaultT
defaulthe likes of B&amp;Q etc are selling items like consumer units to the public who cannot legally ins
defaulttall them or test them for safety without the correct test equipment. Even NAPITs telephone menu system p
defaultrioritises B&amp;Q customers over its own paying members.
default&#xa0;
defaultSo the competent persons scheme doesn’t stop rogue traders whatsoever, there are kitchen fitters 
defaultand the like and their access to electrical components needs cutting off.
default&#xa0;
defaultThat would be the first step to stop a lot of bad installations. The second would be a brand such as ElectricSafe to twin up with GasSafe. It’s a no brainer, and lastly, random on th
defaulte spot inspections need to be carried out, and complaints followed up by the scheme operator whether or not the complaint comes from another contractor or a member of the public. 
default&#xa0;
defaultI actual
defaultly got a customer to complain to
default the NICEIC and they told him it wou
defaultld cost him £2000 for an inspector to come out to him. He was put off instantly. No wonder 
defaultcomplaints
default are so low, they are not being recorded and the operators are keeping complaints about 
defaulttheir
default members under wraps. After all they are paying their wages.
default&#xa0;
defaultW
defaulte need to be licenced to be able to obtain components, and complaints need to be taken more seriously, especially within the NICEIC.
