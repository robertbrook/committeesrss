[normal]Film Distributors’ Association (
[normal]FDA
[normal])
[normal] is the trade body for UK theatrical film distributors, the 
[normal]companies that release films 
[normal]in cinemas 
[normal]and promote them to audiences, propelling the film value chain into motion
[normal]. The feature films brought to market by FDA
[normal]’s diverse membership
[normal]—
[normal]ranging widely from international blockbusters to classic revivals; and fr
[normal]om British films to productio
[normal]ns of 42 other countries in 2013
[normal]—
[normal]account for 99
[normal]% of UK cinema admissions. Lord 
[normal]Puttnam
[normal] of 
[normal]Queensgate
[normal] 
[normal]CBE
[normal] is FDA’s President. 
[normal]Every theatrical film release is effectively a joint-venture between its distributor and the exhibitors willing to play it, 
[normal]while
[normal] distributors’ launch campaigns typically involve a host of partners, suppliers and media.

[normal]Theatrical film distribution is 
[normal]a sophisticated, competitive and dynamic business that depends on 
[normal]product
[normal] and the extent to which it connects with 
[normal]audiences
[normal]. With 1% of the global population, the UK generates 7% of global 
[normal]c
[normal]inema box-office receipts (£1.1
[normal] billion from 172.5 million admiss
[normal]ions in 2012
[normal]). 
[normal]The
[normal] sector operates 
[normal]effectively
[normal] and delivers a significant contribution to the economy in terms of revenue and jobs, as well as the consequent cultural and creative impacts. An economic multiplier effect applies: for every £1 spent on cinem
[normal]a
[normal] tickets, at least a further £3
[normal] is pumped into the economy on directly related expenditure
[normal].

[normal]FDA
[normal] welcomes the opportunity to 
[normal]contribute
[normal] to the inquiry into Online Safety
[normal]. F
[normal]ilm distributors 
[normal]take child protection 
[normal]matters very
[normal] seriously
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Distributors
[normal] have worked effectively
[normal] and consistently
[normal] 
[normal]to safeguard against
[normal] 
[normal]children
[normal] accessing 
[normal]inappropriate
[normal] 
[normal]material
[normal] throughout the last ce
[normal]ntury. 
[normal]Some
[normal] 
[normal]film 
[normal]distributors are established
[normal],
[normal] family-trusted brands

[normal] 
[normal]known
[normal] in their own right

[normal]worldwide, while
[normal] many others partn
[normal]er 
[normal]on particular projects 
[normal]wi
[normal]th 
[normal]brands that appeal to children and young people. 
[normal]For many years
[normal],
[normal] t
[normal]he whole industry
[normal] 
[normal]has worked
[normal] in collaboration with the 
[normal]independent 
[normal]British Board of Film
[normal] Classification (BBFC)
[normal], 
[normal]in 
[normal]helping to 
[normal]conne
[normal]ct audio-
[normal]visual works with 
[normal]age-
[normal]appropriate audience
[normal]s, and better inform those audiences about the content of the works on offer.
[normal] 
[normal]We know that
[normal], in such matters,
[normal] it is essential to retain public trust.

[normal]

[normal]ould like to

[normal]Film d
[normal]istributors have 
[normal]always 
[normal]worked collaboratively 
[normal]with the B
[normal]BFC
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]which celebrated its centenary in 2012
[normal]. 
[normal]This relationship is 
[normal]relied upon by 
[normal]national and local g
[normal]overnment
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]while
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] published 
[normal]film-specific 
[normal]advice is 
[normal]trusted 
[normal]by the 
[normal]public
[normal] 
[normal]– for home/mobile viewing as well as cinema
[normal] visit
[normal]s. 
[normal]Last year’s anno
[normal]uncement
[normal] that
[normal] 
[normal]the BBFC
[normal] was
[normal] 
[normal]to be responsible for the classification of content on mobile 
[normal]devices was greatly welcomed as ensuring
[normal] consistency 
[normal]across
[normal] devices and platforms.
[normal]   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, 
[normal]this
[normal] does 
[normal]further underline 
[normal]the potential for public uncertainty 
[normal]where 
[normal]two separate regulator
[normal]y bodies 
[normal]are responsible for 
[normal]the classification of audio-
[normal]visual products of
[normal] significant simil
[normal]arity. 
[normal]Such
[normal] confusion is most likely to arise 
[normal]when
[normal] 
[normal]a feature film classified by the BBFC and a video game classified by PEGI are based on the
[normal] same intellectual property (
[normal]i.e. share a 
[normal]source of narrative and characters, such as 
[normal]The Hobbit
[normal]). Inevitably this 
[normal]arise
[normal]s
[normal] with
[normal] many of
[normal] the most 
[normal]popular franchises.
[normal] 
[normal]Our concern is that parents will naturally make their decisions to purchase/access a video g
[normal]ame based on 
[normal]their reliance on the long-established BBFC film classifications, perhaps unaware that the BBFC and PEGI 
[normal]approaches
[normal] are
[normal] quite
[normal] different.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In response to consumer research, the BBFC provides clear and detailed information regarding the 
[normal]content
[normal] 
[normal]of 
[normal]every film 
[normal]classified
[normal] in the UK.
[normal] 
[normal]This is relayed by film distributors and cinema operators on a film by film basis, so that parents may make more informed choices. The more fragmented the regulatory regime across entertainment properties, the greater th
[normal]e scope for user confusion.

[normal]The film industry
[normal] 
[normal]has always taken a 
[normal]robust
[normal] approach to 
[normal]restricting
[normal] young people
[normal]’s access
[normal] 
[normal]to inappropriate material
[normal]—
[normal]through the 
[normal]BBFC 
[normal]classification sy
[normal]stem, paid for title by title by film distributors
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As
[normal] the 
[normal]technological 
[normal]innovation
[normal]s
[normal] of video and, in turn, 
[normal]D
[normal]VD
[normal] 
[normal]placed
[normal] 
[normal]more 
[normal]responsibility 
[normal]on
[normal] parents, 
[normal]the industry 
[normal]continued to take
[normal] seriously its obligation to provide clear information to enable 
[normal]parents
[normal] 
[normal]to make appropriate decisions for their 
[normal]own 
[normal]children.
[normal] 
[normal]Today,
[normal] t
[normal]his is becoming increasingly difficult
[normal], as
[normal] young people 
[normal]can
[normal] access material
[normal] 
[normal]online 
[normal]in the ab
[normal]sence of parental supervisi
[normal]on
[normal]—
[normal]rendering them
[normal] vulnerable to what they may find.
[normal] 
[normal]This problem may be 
[normal]exacerbated by the fact that young people are often more technically profi
[normal]cient than their parents.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]FDA
[normal] 
[normal]supports
[normal] recent calls by Government and
[normal] consumer groups 
[normal]for
[normal] 
[normal]Internet Service Providers 
[normal]to
[normal] filter (with age restrictions) and
[normal] appropriately
[normal] label 
[normal]the c
[normal]ontent they make available and monetise.
