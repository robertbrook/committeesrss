defaultIntroduction
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Science Media Centre (SMC) was set up in 2002, in the aftermath of public controversies on BSE, GM crops and MMR, and in response to recommendations in the House of Lords Science and Technology Select Committee's 2000 report on science and society. Its aim is to support and encourage more experts to engage with the media more effectively in times of crisis and controversy, to ensure that the public get access to accurate and evidence-based information through the news.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn over 10 years of responding to stories such as 
default‘Climategate’ and working with scientists to communicate complex science to the media
default we have built up a huge body of expertise.

default&#xa0;defaultAs an organisation we
default support openness and transparency in 
defaultall areas of 
defaultscience
default, particularly where there is media controversy.  
defaultWe run press briefings for journalists, produce fact sheets on controversial scientific areas and seek quotes and interviews from scientists when their subject is in the headlines.
default  We ran the press briefings for all three of the inquiries into UEA and ‘Climategate’. 
default  Our 11 years’ experience 
defaultworking with

defaultThe main contribution researchers can make to the public understanding of climate change is to publicise and shout about all the research taking place. Scientists are filling in the gaps in knowledge and reducing uncertainty every day through research, but often it is published in obscure journals without drawing the media's attention to it.
default 
default The 
defaultSMC works 
defaultregularly 
defaultwith the UK’s top climate scientists to ensure the translation from university lab to newsroom is accurate and responsible, and we
default urge climate researchers to work with press officers to identify more studies that will be of wider media interest.

defaultThe SMC sees all issues in the headlines as opportunities to inform the public and policymakers about key issues, and we encourage experts to engage, irrespective of how complex or controversial a story becomes.  ‘Climategate’, when the emails of climate scientists were hacked and made public, was the perfect example of this.  Science was under attack but it captured the media’s attention for weeks and was therefore the ideal opportunity to talk about climate science to 
defaulta captive audience
default.  
defaultThe SMC ran a number of media briefings during this time
default, including an emergency background briefing with three of the UK’s top climate scientists on the state of climate science,
default to keep channels of communication wide open and journalists well informed.  
defaultIndeed, as the four separate inquiries concluded, the science itself was sound and robust.  Science has nothing to hide and should be transparent and 
defaultforthright
default at all times.
default&#xa0;
default2.3

defaultCorrect bad and exaggerated science
default&#xa0;
defaultIn September 2011 
defaultthe Times Atlas published new maps of Greenland 
defaultwhich misinterpreted scientific data and incorrectly showed ice loss to be 
defaultworse than it really wa
defaults.  T
defaulthis was a publisher’s error and t
defaulthe first people to spot 
defaultit
default were glaciologists 
default- 
defaultwho know that ice loss from warming is indeed fast and 
defaultalarming, but who were concerned that false information was being presented to the public
default in these maps
default.  The SMC helped them communicate this to the press.  Incorrect information must be corrected wherever it is found and scientists are the best people to do that; if it is left unchallenged it undermines trust in science.  
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default              
defaultDon't gloss over uncertainties
default&#xa0;
defaultUncertainty is a normal feature of every branch of science, particularly when we are talking about prediction.  It is sometimes used by climate sceptics to foment doubt 
defaultover
default global warming, just as tobacco companies did with smoking and cancer
default, and such hostility can make scientists fearful of ‘admitting’ to uncertainties or gaps in knowledge
default.  But those uncertainties should never be papered over or dismissed; that would (a) be dishonest and (b) risk overclaiming.

default&#xa0;
default2.5
default              
defaultShout just as
default loud when new science shows reduction in warming
default&#xa0;
defaultThe picture of
default man-made global warming becomes 
defaultclearer
default every time a new paper is published, but sometimes data show that predictions have to be revised downwards – such as the Met Office data which was posted to their website on Christmas Eve 2012.  It was brought to the attention of the press by sceptic groups and made to appear that ‘bad news was being buried
default’
default – it was not, this was an honest mistake on their part
default,
default but damage was done to the image of climate science.  Once again, science does not take sides, and there is nothing to be ashamed of about 
defaultsuch
default evidence.  Scientists should always be the ones bringing these stories to the media and should have no fear of doing so.
default&#xa0;
default2.6
default              
defaultS
defaulttop obsessing about sceptics and address the 
defaultreasonable
default majority
default&#xa0;
defaultThe majority of the public are honest and pragmatic.  We want to be told the truth so we can make up our own minds.  Climate sceptics shout very loud and are given disproportionate media attention but they are not representative of public opinion.  Climate scientists should always feel able to face the sensible, neutral majority when communicating their work.
default&#xa0;
default2.7
default              
defaultBeware 
defaultof 
defaultlooking like campaigners
default&#xa0;
defaultThe SMC tries to ensure that public debate is informed by the most accurate, evidence-based science.  
defaultOf course it’s perfectly alright for scientists to campaign about any issue of importance to them if they choose.  But science does not exist to win arguments 
defaultor be on message.  Scientists are not campaigners, and they should always be allowed to stick to the evidence.  Climate data tell an important story but science is neutral; it is important that climate science is presented to the media accurately, and scientists should be unconcerned with the ‘message’ beloved of green NGOs
default or environmental campaigners
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.8
default              
defaultBe on 
defaultthe 
defaultfront foot
default&#xa0;
defaultWhen climate science or the integrity of scientists are unfairly 
defaultthreatened it is important that the media 
defaultpresent
default a fair assessment, not just rumours and hearsay.  The 
defaultIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (
defaultIPCC
default)
default frequently comes under fire in an attempt to call its science into question
default.  When the work of IPCC author Prof Martin Parry was 
defaultunder scrutiny in a Dutch Environment Agency report, 
defaultwe 
defaultarranged for him and his colleagues to meet journalists to anticipate and tackle the criticisms head-on, resulting in more balanced coverage at a febrile time.  
defaultSimilarly when the emails of Prof
default Phil 
defaultJones’ were dumped on the internet for a second time we rushed him to the SMC to
default 
defaulttake
default 
defaultreporters’ questions on the same day.
default  
defaultThese activities help
default ensure the press receive the full story.  
defaultIt is 
defaultessential
default that scientists, assisted by communicators and press officers, are prepared for 
defaultany
default attempts to discredit their work
default, particularly

default              
defaultDisagree openly
default&#xa0;
defaultScience
default is an argumentative profession
default; indeed it
default progresses by trying to prove itself wrong.  Scientists should be able to freely express disagreement in public and we believe this strengthens science, not diminishes it.  
defaultT

default&#xa0;
defaultScience is at the heart of almost all the major challenges we face as a society: how to treat incurable diseases, how to feed the growing population, how to tackle climate change. 
default 
defaultS
defaulturveys continue to show that the public get most of their information about science
default 
defaultfrom the mass media, including television and newspapers
default1
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultClimate sceptics – those with a view contrary to that of the 
defaultmainstream 
defaultclimate science community – have sought to undermine public confidence in the science by misrepresenting studies and cherry-picking data, and this conflict has fuelled media reporting.
default&#xa0;
defaultYet t
defaulthere is overwhelming agreement among climate scientists
default publishing in peer-reviewed journals
default that climate change is real and man-
defaultmade
default2
default,
default and it is 
defaultimportant
default that this is reflected in media coverage.  The media has a crucial role to play in the understanding of this area of science but it has become a highly political issue, confusing
default (sometimes deliberately)
default our societal response to climate change with the reality of climate change itself.
default&#xa0;
defaultC
defaultlimate change is a slow process whose trends are reflected over decades not days
default and whose impacts are not immediately apparent
default; this makes it a
defaultn unattractive subject for regular media coverage and appetite for reporting 
defaultsince C
defaultlimategate has dropped dramatically.  But when it is covered, the specialist science and environment journalists at the majority of national newspapers and broadcasters have helped ensure that climate science gets fair representation.  The BBC is particularly good, especially so since the Trust Review which rightly recommended they

default the ‘false balance’ created by 
defaultgiving 
defaultequal 
defaultweight
default to sceptics and scientists.  
default&#xa0;
defaultBut many
default of the underlying values remain in newsrooms: the appetite for a scare story, the desire to overstate claims made by one individual, the reluctance to put one alarming story into its wider context, 'journalistic balance' that conveys a divide among experts where there is none, and so on. 
default 
default&#xa0;

default              
default&#xa0;
defaultWho 
defaultto
default trust?
default&#xa0;
defaultPublic trust in scientists remains extremely high 
defaultamong the professions
default1
default.  Much of this is down to an expectation that scientists stick to the evidence and tell it straight.  The SMC supports scientists in their efforts to communicate
default the science and impacts of climate change
default accurately to the 
defaultnews media
default and not get embroiled in political differences or messaging; scientific evidence is not a tool to change behaviour.  
defaultScience does not work by consensus, but consensus is a strong indicator of scientific confidence to journalists and the public.  I
defaultt should underpin government policy and public confidence, just as we expect in medicine.
default&#xa0;
defaultPart of public trust in scientists comes from many experts independently com
defaulting
default to the same conclusion.  It is therefore essential that all climate scientists, especially those advising government and at arms-length bodies, are supported at all levels of government in communicating their science openly and transparently to journalists.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe UK is lucky to have 
defaultsuch 
defaulta huge number of excellent specialist science and 
defaultenvironment
default journalists, across news outlets from tabloids to major broadcast organisations
default 
defaultand 
defaultmuch
default accurate, evidence-based 
defaultreporting can be traced back to them. 
default These specialists are a dedicated and skilful group of journalists who, despite the pressures of the newsroom and editorial lines, take pride and responsibility in getting science stories right. 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultFinally, much has been made of the lack of increase in average surface temperatures since 1998, despite this being well within most predictions and a too short a time frame to draw new conclusions.  It is sometimes used to suggest that global warming has stopped,
default disregarding
default 
defaultall
default the other clear indicators 
defaultsuch
default 
defaultpolar ice melt
default.  Similarly, the idea that the world will gradually get uniformly warmer is a
defaultm often exploited
default myth.  
defaultClimate science
default is a complex, emerging field and scientists need to be able to speak confidently without fear that their comments will be undermined for political gain, and parliament can assist with clear, cross-party recognition of the reality of human-induced climate change even when differences remain over the policy response.
