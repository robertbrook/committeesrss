"                            Written evidence submitted by John Midgley (CCS16)&#xa0;\nExecutive Summary&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nStatement of competencyMy comments below are based on \nexperience gained\n as Fieldwork and Operations Coordinator (2008 \n– \n2013) on the BP, Statoil and Sonatrach joint venture In Salah Gas CCS project. My academic and research qualifications are based on BSc. Hons Combined Science (Geology), MSc. Earth &amp; Environmental Science, M\nSc. Science &amp; Society, BA Hons (Open) focussed on environmental policy and a soon to be completed MA in education focussed on societal and adult learning. \nI am a fellow of the Geological Society of London (F.G.S.) and a member of the Energy Institute (E.I.\n). Currently I am an independent consult on CCS, \nAlternative Energy, S\nhale\n Gas (f\nracking\n)\n and public acceptance issues relating to science and technology. \nMy primary research \ninterests are\n scientific\n, regulatory\n and social aspects of long-term environmental monitoring and inter-generational equity and sustainability. \nI was part of the team who conducted technical appraisals for the UK Government CCS Commercialisation Competition in 2013.\n&#xa0;\nThe following\n comments \nare brief with respect to agreements on confidentiality made to clients (BP Alternative Energy and Senergy\n) and research not yet completed.\n The comments in this document are the basis for a PhD research proposal under discussion for funding.\n&#xa0;\nEvidence for the Commons Select Committee on Carbon Capture and Storage&#xa0;\n1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat are the main barriers (e.g. economic, political, regulatory, scientific and social) to developing large-scale integrated CCS projects in the UK and internationally? How can they be overcome?\n&#xa0;\nThere are considerable barriers to successful implementation of CCS in the UK. Over the last few decades, public expectations of benefits from the environment in which they live have grown immeasurably, in part this is due to a better personal understandi\nng of the physical environment and the part it plays in their lives but is also in part to the increased cultural significance for leisure, social acceptance and its value as inter-generation equity. In parallel to this there has now an automatic and uninf\normed deep cultural shift of enmity toward groups who wish to manipulate this environment for gain. This is \nexpressed\n in emotional and uninformed stances to nuclear power, fracking, \nand potentially CCS. So far, CC\nS has not become a focus for anti-science s\nentiment but given the shared history and mechanisms it has with both deep nuclear waste storage and shale gas fracking there is great potential for public mistrust in carbon storage.\n&#xa0;\nPolitical barriers potentially fall into two groups \n–\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe lack of long-\nterm policy commitment to cost and infrastructure demands. A very expensive leader project started by one administration could easily become a target for cuts by another.\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n“\nThe Tyranny of the weak\n” – \nuninformed voters opposed to CCS could produce a power bl\nock that unseats local councillors and MP\n’\ns, therefore dictating otherwise beneficial policy.\n This has happened with respect to nuclear waste facilities and will probably happen in response to fracking.\n&#xa0;\nRegulatory barriers are considerable and at present \nnot clearly defined. There are pre-existing international and national law on atmospheric emissions, maritime and ground water pollution but they do not directly address CO\n2\n emissions into the biosphere or geosphere. The legal definition of waste pertainin\ng to CO\n2\n is not clear and open to a wide range of interpretations. Ideally CCS legislation will have to be congruent with the existing body of environmental law (some is 200 years old) as well as addressing inter-generational commitments for monitoring, da\nmages and decommissioning payments. The legislative body evolving a legislative framework should comprise scientists, environmentalists and legal persons.\nScientific barriers can and will be mitigated and/or managed by adequate funding and appropriate regu\nlatory frameworks. The question is how much and how intrusive?\n&#xa0;\nSocial barriers are the most threatening to CCS projects. Without public backing the government will be called upon to act in a manner that may not be conducive to full and economic applicatio\nn of these technologies. Science and society live in a shared environment (literally), however that society is deficit in both scientific knowledge and long-term vision and is becoming increasingly vocal in expressing itself at corporate targets. Without p\nroper placement of these technologies in the public psyche CCS may attract the same ire as fracking and nuclear waste (indeed legislation, monitoring and \ninfrastructure is very similar between all three). Potential solutions for this include but are not li\nmited to\n&#xa0;\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFormalising sustainability as a subject in the national curriculum using in part, visiting experts outside the traditional teaching hierarchy.\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUndertaking a government media strategy placing sustainability topics such as CCS in the public arena \n(ref. the MAFF approach with The Archers (Godfrey Baseley, BBC 1950)).\ne)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIncentives for communities willing to host CCS (and fracking / nuclear waste) infrastructure. These incentives should not be direct payment of monies but rather enhanced amenities. \nLower council tax sends the wrong message although a deal on cost of energy bills from suppliers and not directly from government would help.\n&#xa0;\n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAre there any safety issues associated with capturing, transporting and storing carbon dioxide? How could they be\n overcome? Who should have responsibility for ensuring these activities are safe?\n&#xa0;\nThe potential risks associated with deep geologic storage of CO\n2\n are well known and the focus of many research projects. In my experience gained with the In Salah Gas CO\n2\n storage project (\nhttp://www.insalahco2.com/\n) there are significant obstacles in data acquisition \nand \ntranslating\n the results of these projects to an industrial scale.\n&#xa0;\nData acquisition is costly and intrusive. \nGood characterization of a potential site is not limited to geomechanical and fluid flow / poro-perm properties. Hydrogeological studies, soil mapping and ecological surveys must also be undertaken to a level of monitoring that goes beyond current Environm\nental Impact Assessment (EIA) standards due to the subtleties of CO\n2\n impact and that CO\n2\n is naturally occurring in the geosphere and biosphere requiring isotopic differentiation. \nThe cost of specialised probes \nand surveys \nfor soil gas and water quality mon\nitoring is high\n (millions of dollars)\n. Installation by competent persons is required and regular maintenance is mandatory to ensure quality data. Data collection is also costly either in CAPEX for high-end equipment or \nOPEX in manpower and time over the li\nfe of the project for manual collection. \nWe had very good results from InSAR (satellite based ground movement observations) albeit \n‘\nground truthing\n’ \nverification was difficult and costly. While this originally made a very good communication tool correct in\nterpretations of nuanced data requires highly trained and experienced persons. These specialist skills are lacking in a general workforce so the work will tend to focus a few people and companies rather than a publically accountable body.\n&#xa0;\nThere is also th\ne question of timescale for monitoring, based on work in Algeria on the Cretaceous aquifer I estimated a minimum monitoring programme of seventy (70) years\n as a minimum\n. Long-term monitoring to enable a statistically significant level of proper (as in publ\nic interest) decision making makes monitoring an inter-generational project.\n This is a major social rather than scientific barrier and will attenuate investment and incubation of the field depending on how the risks are framed by regulation and government \npolicy.\n Concomitant to this are issues around handover and responsibility as the potential risks will outlive the \n‘\nnormal\n’ \nlifespan of a commercial concern. Depending on the site, pollution transport associated with CCS activities can be a very slow proces\ns (e.g. movement of heavy minerals, CO\n2\n polluted water, arsenic related to corrosion etc.)\n so it is possible that plumes of pollution may n\not be identified for many years and only become apparent when the \n‘\npolluter\n’ \nis no longer in business. This invalidat\nes the current \n‘\npolluter pays\n’ \nmodel for environmental pollution control.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCould the successful development of CCS improve international efforts to mitigate climate change? What role could UK CCS play in this?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nYes. The work of Socolow et al. \n on \n‘\nwedges\n’\n, shows the potential for CCS to impact on climate change. The question that needs clarification is at what cost and are other equally as effective alternatives cheaper? In my opinion there are, but they require the mobilization to action of so\ncieties \nto make small personal changes. If each of the 7 billion people on the \nplanet make a single carbon negative action it will have a great impact. Unfortunately, enabling this \nis very difficult in a consumerist \nand highly politicized \nsociety. Where CC\nS has an advantage\n,\n is that action, taken by a relative few, \nwill\n have a global impact.\n&#xa0;\nFor incubating CCS, the leadership of the UK in this field, and the UK reputation for scientific excellence will enhance our quaternary knowledge economy. UK CCS leade\nrship will create confidence, that confidence, will sway other countries, particularly non-OECD countries with emerging fossil fuel based economies to practice CCS.\n There are also spin off technologies from CCS that will be applicable to both nuclear waste\n and shale gas fracking industries to make them safer, more cost effective and potentially more consumer friendly.\n&#xa0;\nEndnote\nMy comments bridge both science research, public acceptance and environmental policy. Please let me know if you would like to \ndiscuss these issues further.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.globalccsinstitute.com/insights/authors/adamaston/2011/10/17/wedges-reaffirmed-robert-socolow-updates-his-wedges-ana\n"
