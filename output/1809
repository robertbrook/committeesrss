default&#xa0;defaultWe have consulted with a number of industry stakeholders who all testify to the value of diversity in the i
defaultndustry:
defaultCreating a diverse workforce at Thomson Reuters is a critical component of our vision and advances the focus on collaboration and innovation by bringing more women onto our technology teams. We are currently working on a program that we are callin
defaultg, “from college to career”, which will build bridges from colleges to active careers at Thomson Reuters. Part of this initiative is the commitment to recruit and develop future female technology leaders. By creating more diverse teams we add another innov
defaultation dimension advancing future solutions and adding new perspectives and ideas.
defaultJane Moran, CIO, Thomson Reutersdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe leak of women into STEM starts in school and we see girls are not encouraged or properly advised of the richness of a career in IT, and 
defaultthe industry needs a style makeover to move on from the “geeky” back office image it still has. We tend to describe our roles in a very technical way expecting use of “cyber security” will be a major draw – and it is a turn off instead. The use of gaming, 
defaultfun technology and more retail linked brands is much more 
defaulthelpful. Google, Amazon and e-bay don’t have the same problems the more traditional B to B service companies experience in attracting girls.
defaultAnn Brown, Senior Vice President HR, Capgemini UKdefault&#xa0;defaultThere 
defaultaren’t any simple problems or challenges left.
default&#xa0;
default Almost everything we do is beyond the capacity and capabilities of the individual.
default&#xa0;
default We depend entirely on the expanse of talent we can muster by bringing teams together, and like it or not, there are some thi
defaultngs that men and women do equally well, and there are a set of things that one does better than the other.
default&#xa0;
default If you don’t build teams with a balance of men and women, you’re building teams with unnecessary limitations.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn Visa Europe we try and create these
default balanced teams.
default&#xa0;
default Starting in our Visa Apprentice programme and lasting as long as necessary, we provide accelerated development and support programmes and specifically for or female members of staff, to try and accelerate the slow but inevitable rebalanci
defaultng of men and women in all roles in business and technology. 
defaultSteve Chambers, CIO, VISAdefault&#xa0;defaultWomen are an integral and important part of our Global IT team at BG Group. BG Group believes that we will deliver better and more sustainable results if we have a cul
defaultture where different perspectives are encouraged and considered. To achieve this, we aim to build a workforce that is diverse – in ethnicity, gender, background and approach.
defaultAngus McCallum, CIO, BG Groupdefault&#xa0;defaultWomen are leading key areas of our business from 
defaultcentral technology services to strategy to content and are instrumental in our progress as an organisation. We believe that businesses which better reflect society, in all its diversity, will
default 
defaultbe more successful in the long-term.
defaultSelwyn Castleden, IS Directdefaultor Skydefault defaultNetwork Services, BskyBdefault&#xa0;defaultCreating an inclusive workplace is something that IBM has always set out to achieve. Diverse teams energise and challenge each other to deliver strong business results and innovative ideas which is why IBM in the UK and Irel

defaultAt Deloitte our business thrive
defaults on the many and varied talents of our people. The ability to attract, retain and advance talented women is an important part of this. We have set objectives to improve the representation of women in senior roles to ensure women have every opportunity to

default;
default4.1.2 
default              
defaultWomen act differently from men in the workplace. 
defaultWomen sell themselves differently in interviews and performance appraisals.  In predominantly male environments, if men are not aware of these differences, women miss out 
defaulton networking, mentoring and promotion opportunities
default. Everywoman (
defaultwww.everywoman.com

default              
defaultThe UK
default Government has invested in research into the roles that TV and the media play 
defaultin gender stereotyping
default and the
defaultir
default effect on STEM career decisions
default;
default 
default4.2.2
default              
default‘Media coverage of science, particularly television programmes, is a key 
defaultplace
default 
defaultwhere young peoples’ perc
defaulteptions of STEM and its relationship with society are formed…the images young people see presented on television are generally thought to have some influence on the choices some students 
defaultmake about their future careers;
default’
default 
default‘
default4.2.3
default              
defaultIn the UK
default the numbers of women opting 
defaultfor
default IT studies at university continues to fall
default.  W
defaulte believe that without adequate positive representation in the 
defaultm
defaultedia young women will not choose careers in our industry
default,
default despite the good work done by earlier programmes such 
defaultas Computer Clubs for Girls
default (CC4G)
default;
default4.2.4
default              
defaultA relatively recent example of the power of media representations is the upswing in the take-up of Forensic Science courses by young women (women now represent two thirds
default of
default UK students on Forensic Science courses)
default.  This has been largely attributed to the portrayal of a female forensic pathologist in the BBC TV production 
defaultSilent Witness
default.
default4.default3default defaultLack of Role Models default4.3.1
default              
defaultThe lack of visible role models allow
defaults
default gender and industry stereotypes to persist, to reinforce the ‘nerdy’ image of the IT or technical professional
defaults
default. That these perceptions persist sustains the lack of attraction of the IT sector for young 
defaultfemales
default. It is simply not a career default choice. S
defaultchools and HEIs find it difficult to challenge the stereotypes and offer girls an image of an exciting career in IT and technology.  Equally, 
defaultif 
defaultwomen already embarked on IT careers cannot see equality of opportunity and subsequent equality of reward in fe
defaultmale role models, they will opt for other industries where opportunities for advancement 
defaultare visible.
default4.3.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMany organisations have built education outreach programmes, selecting and training women to go into schools to present on the benefits of women in IT. BC
defaultS has been involved with a programme started by Deloitte and Atos and we are aware of other industry based schemes w
defaultith
default the same motivations.  However, these schemes are voluntary, not 
defaultincentivised
default or rewarded, and funding is usually time bounded
default;
default4.3.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOther 
defaultAmbassador s
defaultchemes have had some success.  
defaultResearch cites prominent scientists, media personalities and teachers among the people who influence career choice, beyond members of the immediate family. The government funded scheme, science and engineering amb
defaultassadors (SEAs) was established in 2000.  It increases the number of individuals in early 
defaultcareer 
defaultstages coming into contact with young
defaultsters
default 
defaultthrough
default schools science clubs, to talk about their work.  SEAs were established in recognition of the fact that few 
defaultteachers have experience of working in industry, research or higher education.  Of those that do have relevant experience, by definition it will be limited and will date quickly, especially in fast moving areas such as IT
default;
default4.3.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Everywoman organisation is he
defaultlping to address this through Leadership Academies; one day seminars for women in disciplines such as Technology, Engineering, Manufacturing, or Transport to boost their knowledge and be inspired by leading female figures as role models.

default              
defaultThe UKRC for SET held a very large repository of documentation and training on recruitment, mentoring and retention for women in STEM career

defaultWe

defaults, and in particular, within IT:
default  
default5.1 defaultQuotasdefaultThe argument against

defaultand resides around the desire for a meritocracy, and a desire that women succeed by right of their ability.  However, this pre-supposes that the current state of affairs represents a meritocracy
default, and that the industry will make progress through voluntary a
defaultctions.  Progress, however, continues to be slow and we therefore recommend that:
default&#xa0;default5.1.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe debate should be reopened on setting q
defaultuota
