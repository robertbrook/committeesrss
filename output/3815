[normal]Written Evidence from[bold] [bold]Dr [bold]Emma Crewe, Research Associate, SOAS, University of London[bold] (SCE0022)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Executive Summary[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Observers agree that Parliament is more active and backbenchers have more influence than in the past. Some of the most valuable work of parliamentarians is the least visible to the public. Select Committees are playing important roles in scrutiny and debate but they could improve their communication, management and processes of public engagement.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I make recommendations about improving communication, undertaking more strategic reflection, encouraging effective participation by members, and enhancing both public engagement and the interpretation of evidence. I then explain these recommendations in more detail, referring to the findings of a two-year qualitative research project about the work of MPs.
