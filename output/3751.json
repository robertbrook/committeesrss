"BRC27\nWritten evidence from Mr Barry AndersonMy name is Barry Anderson and this is my personal view.\nI have been employed by Peterborough Regional College for the past 12\n \nyears as an AM2\n electrical\n examiner.\nI \nam a time served electrician\n holding a City &amp; guilds C certificate, City &amp; Guilds 2382 17\nth\n edition Electrical Wiring Regulations &amp; City &amp; Guilds 2391 Inspection &amp; Testing.\nBelow I have listed the problems I believe to exist.\nI fail to see how somebody can be competent in such a short space of time.\nI see these bodies as money making organisations trying to keep a niche market for themselves. \n&#xa0;\nThe solution is have only time-served tradesmen who have a JIB\n/ECS\n grading\n card\n (which\n has a photo\n of person\n proving identity) \nwhich already exists as a body having stamp\ned\n on the card what level of competence they are at. The fee \n(approx\n £15) for this is far less than what the other organisations are charging. This \nis done on an individual basis not as a cover for one person in a company signing all employees work off.\n \nThis would simplify the already very complicated and confusing system.\n How was this missed when first thinking about proving competence?\n              \n25 November 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
