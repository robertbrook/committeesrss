"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by \nSense International \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSense International \n(SI) is an international development NGO that supports deafblind\n people and their families in countries where extreme poverty exists – \nIndia\n, \nBangladesh\n, \nKenya\n, \nUganda\n, \nTanzania\n, \nPeru\n and \nRomania\n. \nBy working closely with families and professionals we supp\nort deafblind people to develop vital communication and life skills\n.\n  \n&#xa0;\n1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSI works in active partnership with local organisations and governments to\n deliver appropriate educational, health and vocational services for deafblind people\n.\n SI supports local disability and parent groups by offering them the training, backing and financial support needed to advocate for their needs and provide mutual support. Together we aim to spread the word about deafblindness and campaign for deafblind pe\nople’s needs to be formally \nrecognised\n and met.\n&#xa0;\n1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs a member of the Bond DDG, we are supporting the disability sector wide recommendations made in that submission and so have only included more specific recommendations.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGovernments need a \nNational Disability Strategy for the inclusion of people with disabilities, including a \nNational Council of Disabled People.\n&#xa0;\n2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMulti-disciplinary working.  As part of this strategy there needs to be a single inter-departmental pathway whi\nch deals with and coordinates the identification, assessment and treatment across all the governmental ministries. \n&#xa0;\n2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSmall scale Civil Society work can provide innovative models for inclusive development.  \n&#xa0;\n2.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPeople with complex needs such as deafblindness \nare harder to reach than people with other disabilities and so are not benefitting from much of the work that DFID is doing.\n&#xa0;\n2.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nStigma and lack of understanding is standing in the way of deafblind people being identified which means that they are isolated and not benefitting from progress being made in development.  This needs to be addressed with national awareness programmes and trainin\ng of teachers, \nhealth workers\n and other professionals. \n&#xa0;\n2.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTeachers, health workers and others need \ntraining in order to understand how to include deafblind people in mainstream services.  The \nspecialist knowledge \nof organisations like SI and its partners is\n needed to provide this training and to support deafblind people to develop the communication and mobility skills they need to be part of their families and communities.\n&#xa0;2.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nParticipation of disabled people is a key element in the development of policy and pr\nactice around disability.  Deafblind people and their families are struggling to participate due to a lack of understanding of their needs, such as the provision of interpreters\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDeafblindness is a combination of \nsight\n \nand \nhearing\n impairments. Some people are completely deaf and blind, but most have a little sight and/or hearing they can use. \nAs a consequence they are unable to\n;\n communicate with their parents and the o\nutside world\n;\n move around independently\n;\n \nand access\n \ninformation and services\n. \n&#xa0;\n3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDeafblind\nness is a spectrum and\n people \nvary enormously in the levels of their disability. \n At one extreme of the spectrum \nindividual\ns\n have \ncognitive and physical disabilities in addition to\n hearing and vision loss\n and at the other \npeople have hearing and vision loss\n. \n \nWhether deafblindness is congenital or acquired influences an individual\n’\ns communication methods and how they identify themselves. \n&#xa0;\n3.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nW\ne are talking about a\n highly diverse\n group\n of people\n. \nHowever, they \nhave \nin common the fact that they are a \nmarginalised\n group \nwith \ndistinctive \ncomplex needs. \nFrom the social model there are specific barriers that prevent this \nparticularly\n marginalised group from accessing services.  \n&#xa0;\n3.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe estimate\n there are \nat least 2.85 million \ndeafblind people amongst the 1 billion people with disabilities globally\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSociety should\n \nnot just be based on what people can add economically, but instead reflect \nthe\n diversity of \na population \nthat\n \nhas\n equal rights and opportunities.  There is a drive \nwithin development \nto make this happen by mainstreaming disability but a\nt present very few d\neafblind\n people are being reached\n.\n  This is due to a number of different factors which we discuss below.\n&#xa0;\n4.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nStigma \n–\n \nPeople with complex needs and their families often face stigma within their communities. \nEqually, t\nhey are often ostracised by their families and have \nlittle or \nno relationship with society. This impedes identification by authorities and inclusion in society\n,\n ultimately preventing access to the services, materials and r\nights individuals need to live.\n&#xa0;\n4.2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nK\nevin\n is deafblind\n, his\n \nmother said “Kevin was unable to walk, talk and see for a long time”. She continued, “We were isolated, \nstigmatised\n and hated by our \nneighbours\n just because of our son’s condition.  Some \nneighbours\n laughed at his strange disability, others stood in wonder at it.” \n&#xa0;\n4.2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n“My husband fled when he realised that Jematia was deaf and blind, and claimed that I had brought curses to his family.  My mother-in-law was also threatening to kill me because of giving\n birth to such a child in their family.”  Eunice \n&#xa0;\n4.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIdentification - \nIdentification of people with disabilities is hard enough but identification of people with complex disabilities is even harder. \n&#xa0;\n4.3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe census is one way to identify the number of disabled \npeople in a country and the Washington Group on Disability Statistics\n has been formulating questions over the last ten years or so that many countries include within their census’.  However, social stigma prevents many families bringing forward people wit\nh deafblindness for the census.  In addition to this, trainings for staff carrying out the census in complex disabilities are needed in order to facilitate their identification of this group.\n&#xa0;\n4.3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis has much wider implications for inclusion and DFID’s work.\n  Issues of shame, embarrassment and fear prevent participation.  How people view deafblindness needs to change. If this doesn’t occur take up rates for any programme or project will never increase/reach target.\n&#xa0;\n4.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCommunication - \nDeafblind individuals have limited communication methods. \n They may use\n;\n speech with the assistance of a hearing aid\n and lipreading\n;\n or they may use sign language (possibly manually\n,\n within a \nsmall visual frame\n or simplified\n)\n;\n or they may use objects\n to un\nderstand what is happening\n.  This means that i\nt is much harder for them\n to communicate their needs, access their\n rights or advocate for change.\n&#xa0;\n4.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMobility - \nDeafblind people also face difficulties with mobility\n.  This can cause difficulties \nboth \nin familiar environments such as their own \nhomes\n and \ncommunities and moving to unfamiliar environments as may be necessary to go to school or work\n.\n&#xa0;4.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAccess to Information - \nCommunication and mobility problems combine to make access to information difficult\n for deafblind people\n.  This means that there may be government programmes and benefits that they would \nbe eligible for but which they know nothing about.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe barriers discussed above need to be addressed for development to be inclusive of \npeople with d\neafblindness\n.  This section \nincludes \nsome of the solutions that can be put in place.\n&#xa0;\n5.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAwareness campaigns - \nTo develop an integrated\n,\n bilateral approach\n, DFID can work with national governments on awareness programmes to create greater underst\nanding of these groups \nand combat discrimination and stigma.\n&#xa0;\n5.2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nF\nor example in the late 1990’s the \nUK\n government ran a campaign about ‘See the person, not the disability’ featuring different disabled people and their lives.  The aim was to show that disabled\n people are like anyone else, wanting friends, family, education, employment etc.\n&#xa0;\n5.2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis campaign was obviously planned specifically for the \nUK\n context but the concept could be adapted for different countries.\n  Lessons could also be learnt from the campaigns to address stigma and disc\nrimination as a result of HIV/Aids\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nParticipation - \nInvolvement of disabled people needs to be a key element of developing policy and practice for people with disabilities. It mak\nes governments and NGOs accountable to the people they serve, ensures transparency and ensures the sustainability of \npolicy and practices.  Deafblind people face more obstacles to participation than any other group of people, due to the profound communicat\nion barriers they face.  \nThe\nrefore, the\n input of deafblind people can ensure no-one is left \nbehind;\n there are a number of different strands that need to be taken into account to achieve this. \n&#xa0;\n5.3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFirstly, deafblind individuals \nwho \nare able to contribute to t\nhese processes \nshould have the opportunity to\n be\n included. SI \nhas supported the creation of\n \nNational \nAssociations \nof Deafblind People \nin several of \nthe\n countries\n where it works\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.3.3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSI India is working with an Adult Deafblind Forum. It aims \nto provide training and support deafblind adults to understand their rights and advocate for change.  The group is very reliant on interpreters and support workers to enable communication amongst the \nmembers\n but they are able to provide mutual support and \nadvocate for change.\n&#xa0;\n5\n.3.2\n              \nSecondly, amongst deafblind people who can contribute to the development of policy and practice there is an urgent need for role models to inspire young people. \n&#xa0;\n5.3.3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nW\nith the support of SI Peru \nMs \nMinaya\n Magally\n took part in a lead\nership course in 2006 and started working for SI Peru in 2007. In 2012 Minaya was hired by \nthe National Council for the Integration of Persons with Disabilities,\n CONADIS as a \"Deafblind Specialist\". \nHer role\n is to develop trainings in the field of deafblin\ndness, deafblind people rights and communication systems to public officials\n. \nCONADIS has become the first public institution in the country to hire a person with deafblindness and Minaya acts a role model for deafblind young people in \nPeru\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n5.3.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThirdly, \nthe \ntraining \nand provision \nof interpreters\n.  Without interpreters with the appropriate skills to support them, many deafblind people are not able to take part in groups and forums.\n&#xa0;\n5.3.3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn 2010, as a result of campaigning by SI Peru a law was introduced, recog\nni\ns\ning deafblindness as a unique disability.  The law gave deafblind people the right to guide interpreters to meet their communication and mobility needs.  In 2011 regulations were approved to set up an interpreter guide service and a register of these in\nterpreters.  These regulations are now starting to be implemented.\n&#xa0;\n5.3.3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n\"Interpreters play a key role in helping deafblind people understand the world around them and participate fully in society. Without the support of a qualified interpreter many deafblind p\neople would struggle to participate in a \nconversation or group activities. Having this support allows a deafblind person to connect with others and feel part of a group.\" Kate Fitch, deputy head of public policy at deafblind charity Sense\n in the \nUK\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.3.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFourthly\n, it is important to involve parents or close family members as many children and adults with complex disabilities find it hard to be able to contribute to these processes themselves. \n&#xa0;\n5.3.4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nS\nI Kenya supported the \nParents of Deafblind Persons\n’\n Organisation\n to \nwork with\n the Kenya National Association of Parents\n,\n in order to jointly lobby the government to increase provision for deafblind education\n.\n \n The \nparents\n’\n \norganisations met with\n the Ministry of Education \nand\n the government committed to add\nitional teachers \nf\no\nr\n deafblind units and to recommending amendments to the \nE\nducation \nB\nill of 2012 to include deafblindness. \n&#xa0;\n5.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSpecialist knowledge - Achieving \nmainstreaming \nfor children and adults with complex disabilities requires the input of specialist \nknowledge.\n&#xa0;\n5.4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nC\nommunity workers who have this specialist knowledge are able to work with deafblind people, their families and communities to develop communication methods and independence skills. \n&#xa0;\n5.4.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn schools teaching assistants are needed to work with \ndeafblind children and make inclusion possible.\n&#xa0;\n5.4.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhis specialist knowledge include\ns\n an understanding of how to develop the communication and social skills; orientation and mobility skills; daily living skills; literacy, numeracy and vocational skills and t\nhe perceptional awareness ne\ncessary\n to achieve a level of independence.  \n&#xa0;\n5.4.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFamilies and communities need to \nbe included in this process \nto enable\n an understanding of how a person can contribute to family and community life.\n \n&#xa0;\n5.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAssistive Devices - To allow deafblind people a voice and \nenable\n them access\n to\n their rights they need assistance with communication\n and mobility\n.\n \n This \nmay \ninvolve t\nhe provision of assistive devices such as hearing\n aids, canes and wheelchairs.\n&#xa0;\n5.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTraining for mainstream staff - Teachers, health workers and others need training in order to understand how to include deafblind people in \nmainstream services.  The specialist knowledge of organisations like SI and its partners is needed to provide this training.\n&#xa0;\n5.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSmall scale Civil Society work can provide i\nnnovative models for inclusive d\nevelopment. Funding civil society programmes is only a small part of what DFID does but it is an important way of developing models that demonstrate to the community, the rest of civil society and the\n government what is possible.  These model programmes act as evidence for effective ways to achieve inclusive development.  \n&#xa0;\n5.7.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn \nBangladesh\n, with\n \nDFID \nassistance,\n SI \nhas a \nprogramme that is implemented by our partner CDD.  This programme has established \na\n National Resource Centre on deafblindness \nin Dhaka,\n which is \nthe first of its kind in \nBangladesh\n. NRC\n partners with 16 development organizations from 16 districts and has reached about 800 deafblind people. \n&#xa0;\n5.7.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe\n hub and spoke model\n has emerged as an impo\nrtant space offering information, training opportunities, referral services and counselling on deafblindness. \n&#xa0;\n5.7.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe NRC has initiated a series of advocacy interventions aimed at the government and other parts of the development sector, including \nthe \nmedia.\n These interventions have aimed to facilitate the recognition of deafblindness as a unique\n disability\n.\n  \nThis was achieved in the inclusion of deafblindness \n(with a definition) \nas one of the eleven categories of disability in the Rights &amp; Protection of Pers\nons with Disabilities Act 2013.\n&#xa0;\n5.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSingle inter-departmental pathways - Individuals with complex needs require support\n from multiple sectors of government (\neducation, health\n, labour). \nT\nhere needs to be a single inter-departmental pathway which deals with and\n coordinates the identification, assessment and treatment across all the governmental ministries.\n \nA multi disciplinary team, that includes parents, \nwill improve the quality of services \nand\n enhance th\ne sustainability of programmes.\n&#xa0;\n5.8.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis pathway \ncould\n be specific to the issue\n, such as\n \nEarly Childhood Development\n for children and a \nVocational Pathway\n for adults which\n would involve the Ministr\ny of Education (\nvocational training from 16-18\n)\n and the Ministry of Labour \n(\nhelp individuals with complex needs \nfind a niche in the market\n)\n. This would help individuals migrate from school voca\ntional work to the marketplace.\n&#xa0;\n5.9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPolicy Architecture - Evidence from other sectors, such as HIV/Aids\n, suggests that the establishment of a National Council of \np\neople\n affected\n,\n combined with \npolitical leadership and resources \ncan result in\n transformational change for disabled people.\n&#xa0;\n5.9.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOnce established, a\n \nNational Council of Disabled People s\nupports\n the drawing up of a \nmulti-sectoral national \ndisability strategy\n. \nTo be effective,\n the council requires\n the political leadership, resources and accountability to people with disabilities to influence policy and practice across the government.\n&#xa0;\n5.9.1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEvidence suggests that when located within the office \nof the \nPrime Minister or President \nis es\nsential to ensure that the Council is effective.\n&#xa0;\n5.9.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs part of \nnational inclusive education programmes\n governments need to provide training to \nmainstream \nteachers\n;\n \nan appropriate curriculum; \nappropriate assistive devices\n;\n teaching assistants to support children in the classroom\n;\n \nto include families and communities\n in the process\n and to ensure there is a focus on the individual needs of the child\n. \n&#xa0;\n5.9.\n2\n.1\n              \nSI India \nis working with the \nMinistry of Education as part of \n \nthei\nr flagship\n educational programme- Sarva Shiksha Abhinya\nn (SSA)\n, to include deafblind children\n.\n \nIndia\n is providing training to teachers in mainstream schools, on including children with deafblindness and multi-sensory\n impairment, as part of the SSA\n.\n \nS\no far over 2,000 teachers across 16 states have been trained. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDFID contributes to the Disability Rights Fund and other organisations that support disabled peoples’ organisations (DPOs), as part of its commitment to \nmainstreaming disability and enabling \nthe participation of disabled people themselves.  \nWhilst we recog\nnise the important work this enables, it is\n an insufficient response to \nreach highly excluded groups such as deafblind people.  \nDeafblind peoples’ associations or groups need interpreters to enable them to take part in meetings and other advocacy work.  Th\ne lack of available interpreters and the cost of funding those interpreters make it very difficult for deafblind people to either apply for funding for their own groups\n or take part in general DPOs.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGovernments need a \nN\national \nDisability\n Strategy\n for the inclusion of people with disabilities, including a \nNational Council of Disabled People\n.  As part of its bilateral work, DFID is in a good position to work with national governments on this plan.\n&#xa0;\n7.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMulti-disciplinary \nworking\n.  \nAs part of th\nis\n \nstrategy\n t\nhere needs to be a single inter-departmental pathway which deals with and coordinates the identification, assessment and treatment across all the governmental ministries. A multi disciplinary team, that includes parents, will improve the quali\nty of services \nand\n enhance the sustainability of programmes.\n&#xa0;\n7.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSmall scale Civil Society work\n can provide innovative models for inclusive development.\n  This fund\ning must continue to enable this work to happen.\n&#xa0;\n7.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAwareness campaigns\n can addre\nss\n \ns\ntigma\n and the need to identify people with complex needs such as deafblindness\n.\n \nAs part of its bilateral work, DFID can work with national governments on awareness programmes to create greater understanding of these groups\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n7.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTeachers, health workers and others need \ntraining\n in order to understand how to include deafblind people in mainstream services.  The \nspecialist knowledge\n \nof organisations like SI and its partners \nis needed \nto provide this training and \nto support deafblind\n people to develop the communication and mobility skills they need to be part of their families and communities.\n&#xa0;\n7.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nParticipation\n of disabled people \nis\n a key element in the development of policy and practice around disability.  Deafblind people and their fam\nilies are struggling to participate due to a lack of understanding of their needs, such as the provision of interpreters\n.\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nThe term deafblind is used throughout this paper to refer to \npeople who are both deafblind and multi-sensory impaired.  Whilst we acknowledge the different medical categories for this group, they share very similar societal obstacles that inhibit or prevent access and inclusion.\n WHO World Report on Disability 2011\n \nhttp://www.cdc.gov/nchs/washington_group.htm\n"
