"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from The TaxPayers’ Alliance (HSR 010)1. \nFounded in 2004 by Matthew Elliott and \nnow with 80,000 supporters, the TaxPayers’ Alliance (TPA) fights to reform taxes, cut spending and protect taxpayers.

In recent weeks, we have seen the Treasury Select Committee call for the project to be put on hold, following on from alarm bells being sounded by the \nNational Audit Office\n \nand \nPublic Accounts Committee, \nwhile the number of \nsenior \npoliticians \nfrom across the political spectrum\n signalling\n their outright opposition to the project\n is also growing by the week\n.\n3. \nOver the last two years, the TaxPayers’ Alliance has published a number of pieces of research questioning the basis on which \nHS2 has got the go-ahead, namely: \n4. \nWe \nupdated that research \nin late September 2013 \nwith \na new report\n, \nHS2 will not solve capacity issues on Britain’s railways\n,\n \ndemonstrating how the already weak case for HS2 is continuing to unravel.\n \nThis report is available to view online at: \nhttp\n://www.taxpayersalliance.com/hs2capacity.pdf\n5. \nWith proponents of the scheme having stopped arguing for it in terms of faster journeys and instead claiming it is needed to address a lack of capacity, we specifically challenge\nd\n the argument that HS2 is required to provide extra capacity on West Coast Main Line (WCML), because:\n6. \nT\nhe report \nalso updated\n earlier TPA research to identify the extent to which dozens of towns and cities across Britain would in fact see a \nworse service if HS2 goes ahead\n, based on information buried on the Department for Transport websit\ne\n:\n7. \nIn advance of the Government making its own claims with \nits\n revised business case, t\nhe report also demonstrated\n that there\n has been a dramatic deterioration in \nthe\n business case \nfor HS2 \nbecause there have been increases in capital costs and a number of additional costs that would have to be incurred in order to live up to ministers’ promises for the new line.\n8. \nAs far as \nthe\n KPMG report\n is concerned\n, we believe it was \nutterly dishonest for the Government to have spent £250,000 of taxpayers' money on a\nn entirely new method of assessing the merits of a transport project\n and then \nonly\n to\n apply it to its preferred scheme.  Worse \nstill, the deliberate removal of figures showing \nthe \nareas that would lose out if HS2 goes ahead amounted to cherry-picking\n findings. \nT\nhis was further evidence, if it were needed, that the KPMG report was a taxpayer-funded propaganda exercise.\n9. \nOur respo\nnse to the publication by the Government of \nThe Strategic Case for HS2\n in October 2013 was that it was another attempt to make the numbers behind HS2 stack up that was yet again found wanting. Those in charge of HS2 \nwere finally forced to admit that people\n on trains do not have zero productivity because they can and do work while travelling. Yet a convenient increase in the number of business passengers projected to use the line allowed the report’s authors to limit the reduction in the benefit-cost ratio (\nBCR). \n10. \nWe were also very surprised that the \nDepartment chose to quote the project’s BCR including the value of wider economic impacts, given that this is not standard DfT procedure for assessing the merits of transport projects\n. The Government needs to\n explain why this was done\n. \n11. T\nhe case for HS2 is now flimsier than ever.  No amount of spin or re-hashing of the figures will change the fact that HS2 would be a huge white elephant, costing every family in the UK a fortune and failing to deliver the i\nnvestment which the UK transport network really needs.\n1\n2\n. \nIn summation, the TaxPayers’ Alliance believes that the entire project should be abandoned now before any more taxpayers’ money is squandered on it.\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
