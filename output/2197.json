"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by StreetGames [WAS0010]&#xa0;Background1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nStreetGames is the national charity dedicated to developing sport in areas of high deprivation.  \nWe specialise in \nbringing the benefits of sport to\n disad\nvantaged young people aged \n14-\n25. \n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo effectively engage young women we run t\nhe Us Girls programme\n (\nwhich was originally lottery funded with a £2.3m award towards a project value of £3.9m\n). The Us Girls programme is the product of a successful bidding cons\nortium that was made up of 60 organisations: together we secured the largest ever investment in disadvantaged young women.\n \nUs\n Girls won the National Lottery Award for Best Sport project 2013. \nhttp:\n//youtu.be/Bl9X8Z\nf3jaE\n. Winners were selected by \npublic vote\n.\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur evidence focuses on \nthe Us Girls’ target group: disadvantaged young women.  \nWe are keen to ensure that this Inquiry considers how vitally important it is to \nprovide\n these\n young women with sport \nand fitness opportunities in their local communities in a style that is attractive to them. \nOur Submission to the Inquiry includes learning and information from examples of work in the Us Girls programme that have been successful in engaging \nyoung \nwomen i\nn sport\n.\n1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nmost recent data from Sport England’s Active People Survey 7 data shows that \n49% of females aged 16-25 years from the \n20% \nhighest socio-economic groups take part in sport at least once a\n week while only \n36% do so from the 20% l\nowest socio-ec\nonomic groups.\n1.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUs Girls \npromotes ‘doorstep sport’ as a means of engaging disadvantaged young\n women \n– \ndoorstep sport\n is sport delivered \nin deprived areas \nat ‘the right time, right place, right price and in the right style’\n to attract \nfemales. \nOver the last \ntwo\n years \nUs Girls has engaged more than 34,481 young women (aged 16-25) in sport and an additional 8,800 under 16s/over 25s\n.\n \nA\nround 40%\n of \nthe \ngirls were not doing any sport or fitness before joining the Us Girls programme\n1.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAround 80\n \nneighbourhood \nprojects \nmake up the Us Girls\n network \n– these \nare locally owned,\n locally controlled and enjoy an enviable reach into disadvantaged communities.\n Our strapline is \nFUN, FITNESS FRIENDS: Get Together with the Girls!&#xa0;Availability of facilities for training and playing sport, for both girls and women at grassroots level1.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nYoung \nwomen\n who have limited or \nno previous sporting \nexperience \nare\n unlikely to visit traditional sport\n \nsettings/venues. Therefore, \nproviding activity in non-traditional sports venues in the loca\nl\n \ncommunity is likely to be more attractive to them\n.\n1.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe\n \nenvironment must be inviting and safe\n and\n young\n \nwomen \nshould\n able to exercise in comfort and at ease. \nSome w\nomen\n, often\n \nthose from \nBME \nbackgrounds prefer/must \nexercise in a\n \nfemale exclusive environment. This means an area with no\n \nmale access or viewing, where windows and doors are\n \nclosed off to the general public, participants and \nstaff\n \nare\n all female\n.\n \nThis is sometimes a challenge. \n1.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHaving \nclear, obvious signage in the facilities\n so that\n \nwom\nen know exactly where to go when they \narrive\n and ensuring that staff are welcoming and are\n \ninformed of the session that is taking place are \nkey\n to ensuring a positive\n \nparticipant experience.\n \n1.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUs Girls sessions are delivered in a variety of local community \nvenues including both traditional and non-traditional sports facilities. The emphasis is on using \nlocal \nand familiar \nprovision\n which\n is important to enable access and \nengage local people. The most popular types of facility used for se\nssions are indoor faci\nlities\n. Only 14% of \nUs Girls \nsessions \nthat \ntook \nplace \nover the last two years \nwere at\n outdoor venues. Research and feedback\n from participants suggests that females from this age group and demographic prefer to be active indoors\n (whatever the weather). \n1.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUs\n \nGirls projects have encountered some \nchallenges in \ngaining \naccess to school sites \nand/\nor \nwith facilities being \ntoo costly\n.\n&#xa0;\nFinance, including sponsorship and prize money1.12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor many young women, cost is one of the main barriers to participating in sport and \nph\nysical activity. A lack of cash\n can have a significant influence on whether or not a young woman is active. For young women from disadvantaged \ncommunities, cost i\ns a \nreal \nbarrier to participation in sport and physical activity.\n \nThere is therefore a need \nfor subsidised female targeted sports programmes to address the barrier of cost\n.\nBy making sport and physical activity cheaper to do \n(with the help of subsidised female targeted programmes) \nand flexible payment options (pay and play activities are importan\nt), young women are more likely to take part.\n1.13\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Us Girls programme has uncovered \nmany entrepreneurial \nfemale\ns who have set up their own community interest companies/charities/businesses to deliver women and girls sports activities. More support for these\n types of women in the form of financial help, expert advice, grants and mentoring schemes would go a long way to strengthen the female workforce providing, facilitating and advocating women’s sport.\n&#xa0;\nMedia coverage 1.14\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt has long been acknowledged that there is significantly less media coverage of female sport. There are only a handful of sports journalists who are truly championing women in sport and the need to raise their profile, most notably Ashling O’Connor (The T\nimes), Tanya Aldred (Telegraph / Guardian) and \nShelley Alexander and \nJessica Creighton (BBC).\n Our experience has shown that we have had to work hard to get national media coverage for Us Girls related work\n but the appointment of positions such as Shelley Alexander’s at the BBC is welcomed.\n1.15\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhilst\n national media interest has increased in last 12 months, in our experience the opportunities available to Us Girls in the m\nedia are restricted to women’s \nsections \nof the \nnationals\n, women’s lifestyle media and sports trade, in particular \nSport\nSister\n. The appetite for Us Girls related work within the mainstream\n nati\nonal sports pages has been\n limited.  \n1.16\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe media interest in the programme is significantly higher when a high profile ambassador is involved. When Nicola Adams attended our 2 year Anniversary \nCelebration Event\n at the House of Commons in July, we were able to secure the attendance of national journalists and coverage in \nThe Telegraph Women\n. Media were also interested in hearing our story and \nachievements,\n when Victoria Pendleton presented us with the \nUs Girls National Lottery Award win\n in August.  \n1.17\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUs\n Girls projects generally have had good media coverage locally but this varies by area. Local project managers often do not have the skills/know how to\n publicise the great work \nthey are doing, therefore any additional support to help raise the profile of women and girls sporting activity locally would be welcomed.\nReasons why participation in sport by women decreases1.18\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nS\ntreet\nG\names\n has recently commissio\nned research work related to the concept of sporting capital, which is analogous to the theory o\nf human capital and defined as the stock of physical, social an\nd psychological attributes and competencies that support and motivate an individual to participate in sport and to sustain that participation over time'. The study investigated the relationship between an \nindividual’s\n sporting capital (made up of 3 domains\n - social, physical and psychological) and the likelihood of participating in sport using data from Sport England APS6 survey. \n1.19\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe research indicated a clear relationship between sporting capital and the probability of participating in sport - so individu\nals with a high SC score were much likely to be participating than those with a low score. The research also highlighted structural inequalities - for example on average males had much higher scores than females as did those from higher socio- economic gro\nups. In particular - women scored much lower than men in the psychological domain and questions relating to body confidence. Therefore, interventions aimed at engaging females are much more likely to succeed if they include elements aimed at raising confid\nence, self-esteem and body image as well as tacking physical barriers.\n1.20\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs well as psychological barriers relating to participation in sport, traditional structures have made it hard for even the interested and motivated young woman living in a disadvantage\nd area to make \ntheir\n own way in sport. This is because the traditional \nsporting structures are \noften \n‘out of reach’:\n \n&#xa0;\n1.21\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Us Girls programme has shown that (non sporty) young wom\nen want sport that is less forma\nl\n, relaxed and \nis based on\n friendship group\ns\n and fun. \n1.22\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe evidence and experience from the Us Girls programme suggest\ns\n that increases in participation are possible through focused resources and efforts. Young women from disadvantaged communities generally need subsidised sporting activities that are delivered on their doorstep in a style that is:\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nfemale only\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nfocused\n on fun, \nfitness \nand\n building\n confidence\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nrelaxed\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nconvenient\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nsafe\n, inclusive &amp; non-threatening\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ninformal\n &amp; welcoming\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nsociable\n &amp; non pressured\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nincludes a variety of activities to try\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nincludes music\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nincentives and rewards\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ndelivered by the right coach/leader\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ninclude\n links to health &amp; wellbeing activities\n.\n&#xa0;1.23\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOften sports sessions are not delivered in the style described\n above and therefore aren’t always attractive to the (non sporty/semi sporty) female market.\n1.24\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSome quotes from \nUs Girls Participant\ns showing why they like the sessions\n include\n:\n \n“I like the sessions because \nthey are\n fun - we can play our own music and the workout is just girls” \n“There are a wide range of sporting activities that I enjoy taking part in and it opens my mind about\n different sports\n…. \nIt’s comfortable, friendly and \ncheap, and it’s in\n a no\nt\n-intimidating”\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe variety of sports on offer to girls at school1.25\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSurv\ney results from a recent \nStreetGames \nstudy\n with a sample of 14-16 year old girls\n from areas \nof high deprivation highlighted a \nnumber of key frustrations relating to taking part in sport at school\n. The girls \nin the study \nfelt that:\n&#xa0;\n1.26\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe sports that the girls took part in most at school were team sports and individual sports, however \nwhen asked to select their favourite sports, and sports they would like to do in the future, sports such as swimming, gym, dance, classes and trampolining were ranked highest.\n For many, \nthese \nsports are\n not on offer at school.\n1.27\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEngaging in sport outside of \nschool was preferred as it was felt they had freedom to choose what they wanted to do, could take exercise more ‘seriously’, and would be more likely to have a coach wh\no could ‘guide’ and ‘push’ them\n.\n1.28\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPrevious experiences of sexism or not being taken \nseriously when taking part in sport inside and outside of school impacts upon the female samples’ perception of sport.\n1.29\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn addition to ‘to\no much school work’ \nbeing a\n key barrier for \ngirls to participate in sport, girls \nalso selected barriers such as ‘not co\nnfident enough to take part’, ‘I don’t think I’m sp\norty’, and ‘no one to go with’. There is also a desire for single sex sessions. \nKey motivators to taking part in sport are being fit and healthy, having fun\n \nexperiences, and improving performance.\n1.30\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is important that \nin order to engage girls, sport\n sessions \nat school \nare developed and promoted in a way\n \nthat offers the\nm\n choice in what they can do, but is within the\n \nselections of sports they would be interested in doing.\n It\n is important to allow for \nan environment where \ngirls\n feel supported and motivated to learn new skills and challenge\n \nthemselves\n – so that they feel the sessions are focused, and that they will have\n \nthe opportunity to improve in a fun, secure environment.\nEvidence of Olympic Legacy on female sports participation 1.31\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThrough the hard work of local projects\n in\n \nthe Us Girls\n network\n,\n \nour monitoring data shows increased activity across \nthe \nUs Girls\n \nprogramme\n when comparing data pre Olympics (April 2011 – March 2012) with the same period the f\nollowing year (April 2012 – March 2013).\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Table 1: Us Girls Headline Monitoring Data (Pre and Post Olympics)AspectOct 2011 – March 2012Oct 2012 – March 2013No. of Us Girls Sessions\n4511\n5178\nNo. of Us Girls Participants\n9230\n11783\nNo. of Girls only \nFestivals (local)\n105\n162\nNo. of Participants Festivals (local)\n2881\n3573\nNo. of Regional Us Girls Rocks Festivals\n0\n4\nFemale Volunteers in the StreetGames Cooperative Young Volunteers Programme (CSYV)\n193\n491\n&#xa0;\n1.32\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs can be seen abov\ne, our data\n sho\nws \nincreased activity across\n the\n Us Girls programme\n post Olympic \nand\n Paralympic Games. \n1.33\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDuring the Olympic Games we launched our #GirlsTimeToMakeItHappenCampaign which is a campaign to develop more opportunities for young women to take part in sport. This hel\nped to grow the number of organisations delivering good sport for young women as part of Us Girls and helped us to sign up a number of ‘Us Girls Champions’ from Team GB to support this effort. This includes Nicola Adams - Us Girls President, Sophie Cox (GB\n Judo), \nSarah Stevenson (GB Taekwondo) and Kate Grey (Paralympic swimmer and\n commentator\n), plus several others (see \nUs\n Girls website\n for more details).\n1.34\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhilst we have seen an \nincrease in interest and activity since the Games, t\nhere is still a need for direct action and support in local areas to garner the enthusiasm of major sporting events in order to develop participation legacies\n.\n&#xa0;\nHow StreetGames increases female sports participation by providing activities that are delivered in an appropriate and effective way1.35\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur successful track record helped StreetGames to secure a £3.38 million National Lottery\n award from Sport England in 2013 to set up over 300 Doorst\nep Sport Clubs (DSCs) in disadvantaged communities by March 2014.  \n1.36\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe initiative, which forms part of a wider DCMS/Sport England youth sport strategy aims to reduce the drop out in sport and help disadvantaged young people to develop a sporting habit for\n life. Our \ntarget\n is for 30% of the young people participating in the DSC programme to be female. We will use the Us Girls branding, the insight gained and the lessons learned from the Us Girls \nprogramme \nto help us achieve this target.\n1.37\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe will do this by p\nroviding a fun, exciting and vibrant place where teenage girls and young women play sports, at a low cost, right on their doorstep in a style that is attractive to them. Young women will be able to take part in a range of sports, which will include dance a\nnd fitness, non-traditional sports and adapted versions of games as well as more traditional sports. They will also be given the opportunity to take part in local sports festivals, get involved in volunteering, leadership or training should they wish to do\n so.  \n1.38\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nStreetGames will also support DSCs to create a vibrant and varied sporting offer all year round to encourage attendance and retention, e.g. via incentives, competitions, group trips, events and links to health and wellbeing activities.  \n1.39\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe are conf\nident that DSCs will attract thousands of young women to participate in sport – but are realistic: alone, this initiative cannot re-dress the current gender disparities that exist.  We\n are therefore, working with other partners in the women’s sport network\n to do this. This includes Women’s Sport Trust, Women’s Sport Net, WSFF, Sportsister and other influential females that champion women’s sport including journalists, presenters, business women and athletes.\n1.40\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMany NGB programmes are not particularly geared t\nowards the \nfemale\n market. We are working with NGBs to share the learning from the Us Girls programme\n \nbut much more needs to be done. England Netball is a fantastic example of an NGB that has used research and insight to develop a \nparticipant\n \ncentred\n approa\nch to provide products and programmes that women want.\n \nThere is a lot to be learnt from the success of netball in engaging a large number of females in sport.\n1.41\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nM\nuch more needs to be done and would welcome lobbying and support to drive this further.  We \nbelieve, that the industry has the ‘know how’ – it just needs resources to ‘turbo charge’ action.\nUs Girls Initiatives &amp; Programmes1.42\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUs Girls has developed a number of initiatives and progr\nammes to help \nachieve its aims and\n objectives:\nOur female only fe\nstival programme.\n \nUs\n Girls Rocks festivals give girls aged 14+ \nthe \nopportunity to try traditional and non-traditional sports, along with a combination of other activities such as health and wellbeing information and beauty treatments. The festivals are fun\n, non-threatening and are held at a local \nand regional level. \nGear4Girls is a new initiative which aims to raise money to supply sports \nequipment and \nclothing to young women and girls from disadvantage communities, people who want to get active but don’t\n have any gear!  As well as raising funds, a host of NGBs are donating equipment to the initiative which can then be distributed to where it’s needed.\n \nUs\n Girls launched its Gear4Girls Campaign on International Women’s Day, headed up by our president Nicola\n \nAdams.\n#GirlsTimeToMakeItHappen is a campaign to develop more opportunities for \nyoung \nwomen to take part in sport. We are keen to develop and grow the number of organisations delivering good sport for young women. We have also signed up Us Girls Champion\ns from Team GB to support this effort. Nicola Adams has been signed up as Us Girls President. Other Us Girls Champions include Sophie Cox (GB Judo), Sarah Stevenson (GB Taekwondo) &amp; Kate Grey (Paralympic swimmer &amp; commentator), plus several others (see web\nsite for more \ndetails). \nUs Girls Alive, is a new strand of the existing Us Girls programme and support\ns\n \nyoung female volunteers to assist in the development of Us Girls Alive clubs \n(like an interactive magazine) \nand the signposting to local physical \nactivity programmes across the country until September 2015. With £395,839 in funding from the Health and Social Care Volunteering Fund from the Department of Health, Us Girls Alive promote\ns\n volunteering as the key to health improvements for young women li\nving in\n disadvantaged communities in 19\n \nareas in England\n.\nUs Girls Tools &amp; Resources1.43\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe \nhave \nalso produced\n a number of tools and resources aimed to help projects and partners to increase and retain young women in sport. These include:\n&#xa0;September 2013\n&#xa0;\n \n \nStudy undertaken by Diva Creative between Jan-April 2013 including an on-line survey with 360 young people and 6 focus groups with 14-16 year olds in\n areas of high deprivation.\n&#xa0;\n"
