defaultBritish Bankers’ Association—Written evidencedefault&#xa0;
defaultThe British Bankers’ Association’s (‘BBA’) membership includes 240 organisations, of which more than 170 are banks and 70 are providers of professional services. Our member banks make up the world's largest international banking cluster, operating +150 mil
defaultlion accounts for UK customers and contributing over £50 billion annually to UK economic growth. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe BBA welcomes the opportunity to contribute to 
defaultth
defaultis
default inquiry
default.
default On this occasion we have limited our comments to the second part of the inquiry, the ‘
defaultNew app
defaultroach to Tax Policy Making
default’.
default default&#xa0;
defaultWe would, of course, be happy to clarify any points raised in these comments.   
default&#xa0;
defaultNew approach to Tax Policy Making default&#xa0;defaultIn September 2010, the BBA responded
default 
defaultwarmly to the HM Treasury (‘HMT’) and HM Revenue &amp;
default Customs (‘HMRC’) consultation on ‘Tax policy making: A new approach’, welcoming and endorsing the general approach.
default&#xa0;
default It is still our position that the published 2010 statement should increase confidence in tax policy making through the provision of greate
defaultr levels of transparency about the rationale and impact of tax policy changes and better consultation.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultThat policy making approach was complemented by the publication of 
defaultt
defaulthe Government’s Tax Consultation Framework in March 2011.
default&#xa0;
default The BBA believes that con
defaultsultation with business, including consultation with representative bodies, is a vital part of effective tax policy making, and that consultation is therefore a key component of the present approach to tax policy making.
default&#xa0;
default The BBA regularly responds to cons
defaultultations conducted by HMT and HMRC.
default&#xa0;
default We have set out below some comments on the approach to tax policy making that has been conducted since the introduction of that Framework in the light of our experience.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the main, the consultation process is workin
defaultg in a constructive manner, resulting in better final legislation for the benefit of both the Exchequer and business.
default&#xa0;
default We would certainly not wish to see a reduction in the extent of consultation, and believe that further improvements could be made.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs a 
defaultgeneral matter, where business has concerns with a measure subject to consultation, or with the way a particular measure is being implemented (perhaps because of unintended consequences or the level of the ensuing compliance burden), it can be quite diffic
defaultult to convince HMRC that change to their original proposal is desirable.
default&#xa0;
default We are also concerned that in cases where HMRC understand the legitimate concerns of business, there is sometimes a preference for addressing this by way of HMRC guidance, rather th
defaultan by better focussed legislation.
default&#xa0;
defaultFor many policy developments there is a single consultation, with HMRC summarising their view of the responses made by business and other stakeholders in a “Summary of Responses” document.
default&#xa0;
default This can lead to the publicati
defaulton of draft legislation with little further consultation.
default&#xa0;
default We recommend that, where 
defaultappropriate
default, the Government (or HMRC on their behalf) 
defaultengages in a meaningful dialogue 
defaultwith the respondents to the original consultation 
defaulton the conclusions being drawn 
defaultbefo
defaultre draft legislation is published.
default&#xa0;
default We think this would be particularly valuable in those cases where concerns raised or changes proposed by consultation respondents have been rejected, since it would allow greater opportunity to identify whether alternati
defaultve approaches might be possible.
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultFormal HMRC consultation documents usually raise specific questions 
defaultand, in turn, HMRC ‘Summary of Responses’
default documents tend to assess consultation responses by 
defaultreference to those questions.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultThere can be instances where
default the consultation questions appear predisposed to certain outcomes.
default&#xa0;
default It is therefore sometimes the case that respondents to a consultation wish to comment on matters which are not the subject of a specific set question, or to suggest that the approach need
defaults to be reconsidered altogether, or to propose alternatives not included in the consultation.
default&#xa0;
default We think therefore that it would be helpful firstly for all consultations to include a general question inviting comments on any matters related to the consultat
defaultion that are not covered by the set questions.
default&#xa0;
default Secondly, and more importantly, we believe that the Summary of Responses document should also set out matters raised by respondents which are relevant to the consultation but that are not covered by the set q
defaultuestions.
default&#xa0;
default HMRC or the Government should also explain why they consider that no action is required to address such additional points, or what action is to be taken, respectively.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe also believe that other developments connected with the Government’s 
defaultpolicy in relation to taxation should be subject to the same consultation requirements as new tax law policy developments.
default&#xa0;
default An example arose in February 2013, which was the consultation on Tax and Procurement involving HMRC and the Cabinet Office, which al
defaultlowed 14 days for consultation. We do not believe that is sufficient time for adequate or considered consultation, particularly when the proposals were scheduled to take effect within six weeks.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe note that the Government’s new approach to tax policy mak
defaulting also led to the establishment of the Tax Professionals Forum.
default&#xa0;
default That Forum has published two reports which we believe 
defaultare helpful contributions
default to the debate around effective tax policy making.
default&#xa0;
default The reports raise a number of constructive comments relati
defaultng to the manner in which consultations and tax policy developments have been approached.
default&#xa0;
default It is not evident to us whether HMRC or the Government have responded to those reports in any detail, either by way of direct reply or by way of enhancing their cons
defaultultation process (noting that both reports contain introductory remarks from the Minister which acknowledge the content).
default&#xa0;
default We therefore believe that it would be helpful for the Government to publish a further response to these reports, and to any future si
defaultmilar reports (or to publicise any response that they have previously made) to explain in more detail how the matters raised have been, or are being, addressed.
