Written evidence submitted[bold] by[bold] [bold]Bill Ritchie[bold]&#xa0;[bold]A programme of land reform should be seen as a means of[bold]extending property rights including ownership, leasing and renting thereby tackling inequality;
[normal]increasing the participation of communities in decision making over land use policy and land use thereby
[normal]strengthening democracy;
[normal]using fiscal and taxation measures to promote specific outcomes thereby providing public benefits and delivering the Scottish Government's Land Use Strategy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Land value tax and land use tax[bold]could provide powerful tools to guide land ownership and land use change, and provide a valuable and alternative source
[normal] 
[normal]of revenue.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Reforming the law of succession[bold]to allow all children the right to inherit heritable and moveable property has the potential to create smaller
[normal]parcels of land and increase the rate of land coming onto the market, especially very large rural land
[normal]holdings, thereby accelerating land reform.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Crofting[bold]is a secure tenure system for extending sustainable land use, creating diverse livelihoods and small scale
[normal]low intensity food and timber production. Measures should be introduced to:
[normal]extend 
[normal]crofting
[normal] tenure to all parts of Scotland;
[normal]create incentives for land owners to create new crofts;
[normal]create planning guidelines for the creation of new croft housing where new crofts are established
[normal]create a target of 10,000 new crofts by 2030;
[normal]The Scottish Government (SG) should lead the way by creating crofts, including woodland crofts, on SG
[normal]owned land.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Hutting[bold]can allow the urban and rural population to benefit from Land Reform through access to land for
[normal]recreational occupation. Measures should be introduced to:
[normal]provide strong political support for the concept of hutting;
[normal]create incentives to landowners to release land through sale or lease;
[normal]create changes to the planning law to provide a definition of a hut and reform of the planning law;
[normal]create changes to the building standards to develop a simple process for obtaining consent to construct huts;
[normal]create a target of 1,000 new huts by 2020.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Allotments[bold]can allow the urban population access to land for growing food and recreation. The SG should
[normal]provide strong political support for the expansion of allotments;
[normal]create a target of 50,000 new urban allotments by 2030.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The Land Reform Act[bold]is not working. Measures should be introduced to:
[normal]simplify and streamline the processes of the Land Reform Act (LRA);
[normal]extended the scope of the LRA;
[normal]amend the LRAÂ  to allow access to the LRA and the Land Fund by properly constituted bodies set up with the purpose of establishing new crofts, small holdings and huts;
[normal]similar amendments should be made to the 
[normal]the
[normal] National Forest Land Scheme .
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Resources[bold]The Scottish Government should ensure that there are adequate resources including financial resources to drive forward a comprehensive land reform programme. A new body should be created to ensure effective delivery of the land reform programme.
