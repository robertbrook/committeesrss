"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the College of Emergency medicine (PEX 0005)1.0 \n              \nSummary\n1.1              Acuity, complexity and value: To build a system that creates incentives to keep patients out of hospital, we need better data to create smarter tariffs, targeted at patients who could and should have definitive treatment in the Emergency Department and should not be admitted.\n1.2               The ‘toothpaste tube’ model of acute and social care: Acute health and social care is like a ‘toothpaste tube’ – if one area is squeezed, the demand will flow to other areas, and the Emergency Department can never say ‘no’. Acute care is inadequately measured ('Flying Blind' in the words of the Health Select Committee, July 2013) and therefore tends to bear a disproportionate burden of cuts. Because the data is poor, there is a long feedback loop between lack of resources and poor outcomes being noticed. It is no coincidence that 90% of the deaths at Mid Staffs were in the acute care pathway.\n1.3               Small hospital vs. big hospital:  We believe that old model of the District General Hospital that ‘does everything’ is not viable clinically or financially. Instead the DGH should be re-invented to run ‘smaller and hotter’. Any hospital with a Red H must be able to deal with any patient who may reasonably attend – the few whose health needs cannot be met locally will be transferred. This is the network model that works in Australia and New Zealand and it is a safe and cost-effective way of retaining local services while delivering the expertise necessary for uncommon but serious health needs. The foundation for this model of care is a strong and effective Emergency Department.\n1.4              \nAcute vs. elective care: At present the tariff based payment system does not promote equity of acute and elective care. A fit-for-purpose tariff would allow well managed acute trusts to deliver high quality acute care without negative revenue consequences.\n1.5 \n              \nRecommendations: The College of Emergency Medicine asks the Committee to recommend that:\n1.\n              \nEmergency Departments must collect data on every patient’s presenting complaint.\n2.\n              \nEmergency Departments must collect data on every patient’s acuity and complexity.\n3.\n              \nEmergency Departments must collect data on every patient’s discharge diagnosis.\n4.\n              \nThe current ‘reference cost’ system that is used to estimate costs for the acute care tariff is replaced by a system of a few sentinel hospitals with the funding and expertise to accurately cost acute healthcare.\n5.\n              \nIncentives (‘Best Practice Tariffs’) be developed that are linked to presenting complaint/ discharge diagnosis that encourage definitive care in the Emergency Department, avoiding hospital admission.\n6.\n              \nEmergency Department remuneration must be directly linked to the number of patients attending.\n7.\n              \nPatients who attend the Emergency Department because their needs are not being met by their appropriate providers e.g. General Practice should be remunerated at a mandatory penalty rate [a ‘Worst Practice Tariff’] to encourage Commissioners EITHER to develop external services OR to work with Emergency Departments to streamline services at the hospital e.g. co-located services.\n2.0 \n              \nIntroduction\n2.1 \n              \nIn July 2013 the Health Select Committee stated that Emergency Care was ‘flying blind’ – that is to say there is insufficient relevant data to be able to accurately commission or monitor services. The recent apparently sudden \ndecompensation\n of Emergency Care has come as a surprise to those not directly involved. \n2.2 \n              \nThe College of Emergency Medicine is very grateful that the Committee is continuing its work on investigating the interaction between health and social care and we have grouped the points we wish to make to the Committee into four themes:\n3.1 \n              \nIt will come as no surprise to the Committee that the deficits in information about acute healthcare is coupled with a lack of consistent and appropriate remuneration of acute healthcare.\n3.2\n              \nWe know that numbers of patients seeking acute healthcare continue to rise, however this is not the only problem facing acute healthcare. The current system has not measured the increase in \nacuity (sicker patients) and \ncomplexity (older and frailer patients with more diseases, who are on more drugs) of patients treated in Emergency Departments. \n3.3\n              \nThe current system of \nPbR\n does not fairly remunerate more complex activity:\n3.3.1 \n              \nAn 18-year-old student who sustains a sprained ankle playing football:\nRequires initial assessment/ triage, oral analgesia and an X-ray, in and out in 5 minutes – 15 minutes of Nurse Practitioner time\nPbR\n Tariff = Category 2 investigation, Category 2 treatment = \n£1193.3.2 \n              \nA frail elderly patient who lives in a residential home has an unexplained collapse:\nRequires initial assessment/ triage, \ni.v\n. line, bloods ECG (heart tracing) Chest X-ray, urine testing, 4 hours of continuous monitoring, nursing, feeding, observation and cubicle / trolley occupation, 1 hour medical time\nPbR\n Tariff = Category 2 investigation, Category 1 treatment = \n£1103.4\n              \nThe current system therefore does not match remuneration with complexity or acuity. The mechanism to remedy this (reference costing) exists within \nPbR\n, but is not used effectively.\n3.5\n              \nFurthermore, within the current system of \nPbR\n there are perverse incentive to admit patients or bring patients back for outpatient treatment of wounds at additional cost to the commissioner, rather than to treat and discharge, providing a better and cheaper ‘one stop shop’ service:\n3.5.1\n              \nExample:\n an elderly and confused nursing home resident with multiple medical problems falls out of bed dislocating his hip replacement.\nTreatment in Emergency Department and discharge home:\n              \n              \nPbR\n Tariff = Category 2 investigation + Category 4 treatment = \n£139Treatment as an inpatient:\n              \n              \nPbR\n Tariff = HA14A Minor Hip Procedure +CC = \n£2,7773.6\n              \nTherefore if we are to build a system that creates incentives to keep patients out of hospital, we need better data to create smarter tariffs, targeted at patients who could and should have definitive treatment in the Emergency Department and should not be admitted.\n3.7\n              \nThe system is not completely broken, and there is no logic to starting again and re-organising a system of remuneration that have been proved to work elsewhere in the world. \n3.8\n              \nHowever, the current system does require adjustment to meet the needs of the service and its users and we are confident that the NHS \nPbR\n team, now part of Monitor, have the skills to do this, so that we can capture and understand value-based acute healthcare.\n3.9\n              \nWe can only understand value-added of a process if we measure inputs and outputs:\n3.10\n              \nIn the longer term we can use this data to be able to judge how likely an admission is to be necessary, and therefore how good the Emergency Department/ other sources of urgent care are as a filter - only admitting those patients that really need, and will benefit from hospital admission.\n3.11\n              \nWe therefore request the committee recommend that:4.1\n              \n At present the tariff based payment system does not promote equity of acute and elective care. The current tariff arrangements ensure that for all acute trusts, providing emergency department care is a loss making exercise. Only cross subsidy from elective care revenues prevents these trusts becoming insolvent.\n4.2\n              \nA fit-for-purpose tariff would allow well managed acute trusts to deliver high quality acute care without negative revenue consequences. In the absence of such tariffs, investment in emergency departments and services makes little economic sense.\n5.1\n              \nAs the ‘Nicholson Challenge’ is starting to bite, the NHS and social care providers look to cut ‘discretionary’ spending. Acute health and social care is like a ‘toothpaste tube’ – if one area is squeezed, the demand will flow to other areas, and the Emergency Department can never say ‘no’.\n5.2\n              \nIn acute healthcare, it is very difficult to match cause and effect to allocate resources effectively. In elective inpatient care, or General Practice, if one doctor is removed, then the operation or the clinic does not happen. In acute care, the patients keep coming, and the staff who are left just have to cope.\n5.3\n              \nIn urgent and emergency care, changes such as:\n5.3.1\n              \nsequential removal and substitution of services (General Practice/ Out of Hours/ Minor Injury Units/ Walk in Centres/ NHS Direct/ 111).\n&#xa0;\n5.3.2\n              \nincreased public demand for a 24 hour service.\n&#xa0;\n5.3.3\n              \nthe four hour standard reducing time to treatment for minor conditions.\nhave resulted in the public inadvertently being trained to go to where ‘the lights are always on’ – the Emergency Department. \n5.4\n              \nTherefore we ask the Committee to recommend that:6.1\n              \nOne of the narratives around acute care is that small hospitals are necessarily inferior and inefficient: there is no logical reason for this to be so. Small hospitals meet a population need and both small and large hospitals are complementary components in the NHS ecosystem, as is seen in other similar health economies e.g. Australia.\n6.2\n              \nBig hospitals are best at performing complex work like trauma and cardiac services that require economies of scale. Small hospitals can offer a safe and cost effective level of care and co-ordinate local services to local patients – the backbone to acute integrated care enables patients who have deteriorated to be kept at home. There is local accountability that is eroded if all services are delivered from a long way away, particularly if the supplier is effectively a monopoly provider, negating any market–testing.\n6.3\n              \nCentralising all acute care to large hospitals physically remote from local populations looks attractive to those who would be monopoly providers in such a re-organisation, but would severely limit choice and would further concentrate power in the hands of a limited number of providers. There would also be less resilience in the event of a major incident e.g. which closes the large acute hospital.\n6.4\n              \nA good analogy is that we shop in both local convenience stores and in large out of town supermarkets that may even be run by the same organisation. We expect that the quality in the smaller shop will be just as good, but the range of goods will not be as wide.\n6.5\n              \nWe believe that old model of the District General Hospital that ‘does everything’ is not viable clinically or financially. The only alternative to closing many smaller hospitals is to re-invent the DGH to run ‘smaller and hotter’. \n6.6\n              \nAny hospital with a Red H must be able to deal with any patient who may reasonably attend – the few whose health needs cannot be met locally will be transferred. This is the network model that works in Australia and New Zealand and it is a safe and cost-effective way of retaining local services while delivering the expertise necessary for uncommon but serious health needs.\n6.7\n              \nThe foundation for this model of care is a strong and effective Emergency Department.\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
