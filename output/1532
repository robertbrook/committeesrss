defaultWritten evidence 
defaultfrom Buckinghamshire County Council (TIC 42)
default&#xa0;defaultA response is given below on each of the issues identified by the Committee as the focus for the request for evidence.
default&#xa0;
default1. defaultHow do defaultGovernment and local authorities identify demand for passenger transport in isolated communities (including rural and urban areas and island communities)?default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default1.1 
defaultGiven the ongoing reduction in local authority funding our current focus in on managing the exi
defaultsting public transport network and seeking to maintain existing services where they show reasonable usage. In terms of identifying new demand this is largely linked to new developments where funding for additional public transport can at least be pump prim
defaulted through s106 funds.
default&#xa0;
default1.2 
defaultOther new demands in rural areas would be more limited. Our current public transport network is largely based on historic route patterns and smaller communities which generate few passengers are likely to be served only where ro
defaultutes and road layouts lend themselves at no more than a marginal cost.
default&#xa0;
default1.3 
defaultThe common means of identifying demand are through:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2. defaultTo what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers (e.g. people with disabilities, older people, youndefaultg people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?default&#xa0;
default2.1 
defaultBuckinghamshire County Council 
defaultconsiders
default the needs of elderly and disabled passengers through a number of measures:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.2 
defaultFor younger people we offer subsidised leisure (after 09:00) bus travel for 16-19 year olds and some subsidised discretional travel to out
default of catchment schools / colleges. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3. defaultWhat are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities? How can these challenges be overcome?default&#xa0;default3.1 
defaultCost is the main barrier. Buses are best su
defaultited to mass transit along corridors and in the current economic climate where the drive is to do “more with less” then inevitably there is a focus on maintaining services carrying larger numbers of passengers. Rural areas have flows which are diverse and 
defaultoften cannot easily be aggregated together into cost-efficient routes.
default&#xa0;
default3.2 
defaultWe are experimenting with DRT services using an extension the Northamptonshire County Connect service in the rural NW corner of Buckinghamshire but pre-booking is unpopular and cos
defaultt per passenger is high with DRT services.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4. defaultHow effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?default&#xa0;
default4.1 
defaultThis can be an effective solution but local authorities
default are not necessarily able to rely on CT schemes as part of long term strategies (although risks also exist with relying on commercially operated bus services for example) The CT sector is diverse but ultimately schemes are reliant on 
defaultlocal authority 
defaultfundin
defaultg or 
defaulton 
defaultvolunteering 
defaultand 
defaultfund raising by the local community
default - or both.
default&#xa0;
default4.2 
defaultThe view, that community transport will simply back-fill bus services cut by councils, is unlikely to become a reality. Most services for isolated rural areas that are council funded are likely to continue to require revenue support; that is why they are s
defaultupported and not commercial in the first place. The need for support for rural services generally needs to be seen as a given; there are clearly exceptions where geography etc. may help to enable a more viable operation, but on the whole there is little sc
defaultope for making rural services sustainable. 
default&#xa0;
default4.3 
defaultFor the kinds of transport needs faced by very small isolated communities local voluntary car schemes can be a good solution, particularly in areas of relative affluence and higher car ownership such much of
default Buckinghamshire. We seek to encourage such schemes, offer support and advice and some limited pump priming funding but ultimately schemes will only happen where there is strong community support which isn’t necessarily the areas of greatest need.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5. defaultTo defaultwhat extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive transport services?default&#xa0;
default5.1 
defaultTaxis are more or less universally available, but the cost is clearly prohibitive for regular use for many people. Wheelchair accessible taxis are not universally available in rural areas however. 
default&#xa0;
default5.2 
defaultCost is 
defaulta significant
default issue, in particular the fact t
defaulthat ENCTS makes travel free on buses, in stark 
defaultcontract
default to taxi fares or even Dial-a-Ride fares.
default 
default&#xa0;
default5.3 
defaultDRT services are often unsuitable for regular commuting to work. Often schemes only allow for booking up to a week/ fortnight ahead, which in itself is a
default barrier to meeting workers’ travel needs. DRT can be seen to work better for off-peak accessibility needs to shopping/ town centre facilities and services but experience in Buckinghamshire is that users prefer scheduled services and these are cheaper to o
defaultperate than DRT.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default6. defaultWhat are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities? How can these services be made more affordable?default&#xa0;
default6.1 
defaultMany public transport services serving isolated communities can never become sustain
defaultable, given the low revenue compared to costs, and the aspiration to make these services affordable in terms of financial viability may be largely unobtainable. 
default&#xa0;
default6.2 
defaultUntil the real value of public transport is recognised and used to unlock additional fund
defaulting then local authorities will continue to be faced with having to cut public transport services and the lower passengers numbers and higher costs associated with serving isolated communities will always see them under greater threat.
default&#xa0;
default6.3 
defaultThe continued 
defaulthigh cost of the ENCTS public transport spend also acts as a  barrier to continuing spend on supporting rural public transport services - as many councils understandably feel they are already spending too much on public transport. Given the pressure on bud
defaultgets this view is at the very least understandable.
default&#xa0;
default6.4 
defaultThere are also concerns over the impact of BSOG reductions and its devolution. This is likely to
default both 
defaultfurther red
defaultuce funding and raise operating costs for rural services.
