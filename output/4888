defaultWritten evidence submitted bydefault defaultARTICLE 19default [CT 19]defaultRe: Concerning the review of defaultThe Guardiandefault newspaper as part of the inquiry into anti-terrorismdefaultI am writing to you on behalf of the international freedom of expression group
default,
default ARTICLE 19
default,
default and leading civil liberties groups and campaigners in the UK, in relation to the Committee’s review of 
defaultThe Guardian 
defaultnewspaper as a part of the inquiry into anti-terrorism. 
defaultWe are
default deeply concerned that the Committee’s review of 
defaultThe Guardian
default could 
defaultrestrict media freedom 
defaultin the UK, 
defaultby discouraging future reporting on important matters of public interest. This includes future reporting concerning the sensitive area of national security. 
defaultWe also believe that the Committee’s review of 
defaultThe Guardian
default raises concerns about the human rights of all individuals to be able to access information about government activities, and to be able to use that information to engage in public debate.
defaultWe 
defaultwrite to you to ask that you consider this 
defaultan defaultimportant defaultopportunity to hear first-hand about the impact defaultthat defaultpressure by the government and the security services defaulthas defaulton the free pressdefault 
defaultwhen 
defaultdealing with 
defaultissues related to 
defaultnational security. Frequently, around the world, national security is used 
defaultto justify arbitrary 
defaultcensor
defaultship 
defaultand 
defaultto curtail free
defaultdom
default of expression and press freedom. The international community are listening to the vigorous debate currently taking place in the UK 
defaultthat has been sparked by 
defaultThe Guardian
default. The 
defaultvoice of the Committee will 
defaultbe 
defaultheard and will have influence beyond UK borders. 
defaultWe, therefore, urge that 
defaultthe Committee’s defaultreview of defaultThe Guardiandefault defaultfully considerdefaultsdefault and takedefaultsdefault into account international human rights standards, and in particular those that relate to the right to freedom of expression and media freedomdefault. 
defaultInternational standards on freedom of expression clearly stipulate that national security arguments must never be used to justify preventing disclosures of illegalities or wrongdoing, no matter how embarrassing such disclosures may be to governments. A summary of the relevant standards is outlined for your consideration in the enclosed Annex (“International freedom of expression standards relating to 
defaultThe Guardian
default newspaper’s reporting of the Snowden disclosures”).
defaultIn the present matter,
default The Guardian
default published information on large-scale internet and telephone surveillance program
defaultme
defaults operated by the US Government with the assistance of the UK security services and a range of private sector internet and telephone companies. The publication of this information has facilitated a much-needed public debate about mass surveillance in a democracy. It also exposed the possible violation of the fundamental human rights of millions of people worldwide. We firmly believe that these matters fall within the public and political field which, according to the UN Human Rights Committee, necessitates special respect and requires the government to provide a particularly pressing justification for restrictions on freedom expression.
defaultWe 
defaultobserve that the UK government has so far failed to “specify the precise nature of the threat” relating to national security and has relied solely on a general statements referencing the concept of national security. General statements about the threat to national security do not meet established international standards on freedom of expression and media freedom, nor do they present a sufficiently justified pressing social need for such restrictions. The government has also failed to show that that there has been demonstrable harm to national security, and that this harm outweighs the public benefit derived from disclosures about mass surveillance and the potential violation of human rights.
defaultWe find that 
defaultThe Guardian’s
default publishing of the Snowden disclosures relates not only to matters of great public importance, but is also directly concerned with reporting the human rights violations entailed in mass surveillance. As such, the most stringent journalistic protection is required.
defaultW
defaulte 
defaulturge the Committee to uphold international standards on freedom of expression in the present review.
default We respectfully call on you to unequivocally dismiss all allegations that the publishing activities of defaultThe Guardiandefault have breached national security.default We strongly believe that any conclusion to the contrary would have a dangerous impact on human rights protection in the UK and would undermine the UK’s international obligations.
defaultWe are further concerned that the Committee’s review into 
defaultThe Guardian’s
default activities 
defaultfurther 
defaultadds to an already unduly hostile environment
default for investigative journalism
default. We believe that sustained pressure is being applied to 
defaultThe Guardian
default by politicians and the authorities as a result of their reporting of the Snowden’s revelations. 
defaultWe would like to ask the Committee to be mindful that its approach to questioning 
defaultT
defaulthe Guardian
default could bolster politically motivated pressure designed to curtail serious public interest journalism. It is for this reason that we ask you to 
defaultdefend and protect the right to freedom of expression and media freedom in the UK. 
defaultWe would be 
defaultvery 
defaulthappy to further assist you in ensuring that the international standards are protected in the present review. Please do not hesitate to contact us should you need any further information.

defaultThe right to freedom of expression 
defaultis protected under 
defaultinternational and 
defaultEuropean law. 
defaultNotwithstanding its importance, the right is not absolute and may be restricted in certain 
defaultlimited 
defaultcircumstances. 
default&#xa0;
defaultUnder Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), restrictions on the right are permitted, 
defaultinter alia
default, to ensure the protection of national security or public order (
defaultordre public
default). However, when a State party imposes restrictions on the exercise of freedom of expression, these restrictions 
defaultshould
default 
defaultnot jeopardis
defaulte the right itself.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultUN 
defaultHuman Rights Committee has indicated that the relationship between right and restriction
default,
default and between 
defaultthe 
defaultnorm and 
defaultthe 
defaultexception
default,
default must not be reversed.
default&#xa0;
defaultArticle 19(3) also lays down specific conditions, and it is only subject to these conditions that restrictions may be imposed (the “three part test”):
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultRestrictions must be applied only for those purposes for which they were prescribed and must be directly related to the specific need on which they are predicated.

defaultillustrated and

default&#xa0;
defaultUnder the above standards the need to protect national security may warrant restriction upon an individual’s freedom of expression, but only if such a limitation is, 
defaultinter alia,
default 
default“necessary” for a legitimate purpose in the sense that there must be a “pressing social need” for the restrictiondefault.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe principle of proportionality also has to be respected in the sense that any restriction “must be the 
defaultleast intrusive measure to achieve the intended legitimate objectivedefault and the 
defaultspecific interference in any particular instance must be directly related and proportionate to the need on which they are predicateddefault.”
default All authorities must respect the
default principle of proportionality 
defaultwhen applying the restrictions.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultLimiting the right to freedom of expression on the grounds of national securitydefault&#xa0;
defaultWhile there is a no universal definition of national security, there has been extensive development on the scope and boundaries of the concept by UN bodies and experts in the past two decades. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe note that these elaborations have taken a narrow view of the scope of the c
defaultoncept of “national security.” A
defaults a preliminary matter, the UN Human Rights Committee has found that states must 
default“specify the precise nature of the threat”default relating to national security 
defaultrather than relying on a general statement of the conceptdefault.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn General Comment No. 34, the Human Rights Committee explicitly stated that: 
default&#xa0;
defaultExtreme care must be taken by State parties to ensure that treason laws and similar provisions relating to national security, whether described as official secrets or sedition laws or otherwise, are crafted and applied in a manner that conforms to the strict requirements of paragraph 3. It is not compatible with paragraph 3, for instance, to invoke such laws to 
defaultsuppress or withhold from the public information of legitimate public interest that does not harm national security or to prosecute journalistsdefault, researchers, environmental activists, human rights defenders, or others, for having disseminated such information.
default 
default [emphasis added]
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Siracusa Principles on the Limitation and Derogation of Provisions in the ICCPR further sets out circumstances in which national security can legitimately apply:
default 
default&#xa0;
default29. National security may be invoked to justify measures limiting certain rights only when they are taken to protect the existence of the nation or its territorial integrity or political independence against force or threat of force.
default&#xa0;
default30. National security cannot be invoked as a reason for imposing limitations to prevent merely local or relatively isolated threats to law and order.
default&#xa0;
default31. National security cannot be used as a pretext for imposing vague or arbitrary limitations and may only be invoked when there exists adequate safeguards and effective remedies against abuse.
default&#xa0;
default32. The 
defaultsystematic violation of human rights undermines true national security and may jeopardize international peace and security. A state responsible for such violation shall not invoke national security as a justification for measures aimed at suppressing opposition to such violation or at perpetrating repressive practices against its populationdefault. [emphasis adde

default&#xa0;
defaultThe UN Special Rapporteur on Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of
default 
defaultOpinion and Expression also set out his expert view on limitation in his report to the
default 
defaultCommission on Human Rights in 1994:
default&#xa0;
defaultFor the purpose of protecting national security, the right to freedom of expression and information can be restricted only in the most serious cases of a direct political or military threat to the entire nation.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Special Rapporteur, in cooperation with the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media and the OAS Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression, issued a special declaration on freedom of information in 2004, stating:
default&#xa0;
defaultCertain information may legitimately be secret on grounds of national security or protection of other overriding interests. However, secrecy laws should define national security precisely and indicate clearly the criteria which should be used in determining whether or not information can be declared.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe definition of national security has also been further developed by the Johannesburg Principles on National Security, Freedom of Expression and Access to Information:
default&#xa0;
default(a) A restriction sought to be justified on the ground of national security is not legitimate unless its genuine purpose and demonstrable effect is to protect a country's existence or its territorial integrity against the use or threat of force, or its capacity to respond to the use or threat of force, whether from an external source, such as a military threat, or an internal source, such as incitement to violent overthrow of the government.
default(b) In particular, a restriction sought to be justified on the ground of national security is not legitimate if its genuine purpose or demonstrable effect is to protect interests unrelated to national security, including, for example, to protect a government from embarrassment or exposure of wrongdoing, or to conceal information about the functioning of its public institutions, or to entrench a particular ideology, or to suppress industrial unrest
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs described above, states must show that a restriction on freedom of expression on national security grounds is necessary. Principle 15(1) of the Johannesburg Principles elaborates on this requirement by stating that 
default“no person may be punished on national security grounds for disclosure of information if (1) the disclosure does not actually harm and is not likely to harm a legitimate national security interest.”default&#xa0;
defaultAdditionally, the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression, in his 2012 report reiterated that
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultJournalists should not be held accountable for receiving, storing and disseminating classified data which they have obtained in a way that is not illegal, including leaks and information received from unidentified sources.
default&#xa0;
defaultFurther, the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media and the OAS Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression, in the declaration on freedom of information explicitly stated that:
default&#xa0;
defaultPublic authorities and their staff bear sole responsibility for protecting the confidentiality of legitimately secret information under their control. Other individuals, including 
defaultjournalists and civil society representatives, should never be subject to liability for publishing or further disseminating this information, regardless of whether or not it has been leaked to them, unless they committed fraud or another crime to obtain the informationdefault. Criminal law provisions that don’t restrict liability for the dissemination of State secrets to those who are officially entitled to handle those secrets should be repealed or amended.
