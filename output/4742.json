\nChair:  Good morning.  This is a special session of the Select Committee, to conduct a pre-appointment hearing of the Government’s preferred candidate for the Chairman of \nOfcom\n, Dame Patricia Hodgson.  If I could start, Dame Patricia, what do you think are the main priorities you will face as the new Chairman of \nOfcom\n?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: The communications sector in this country has been clearly a great success over the last decade.  It has been growing at twice the rate of the economy as a whole, there is a wider range of services, and on average prices have been falling in telecoms; they have come down for 10 years.  Clearly, this is because of technological innovation—the blossoming of our creative industries.  However, \nOfcom\n has been doing some things right: an emphasis on competition, and rolling back regulation in telecoms, broadcasting and post.  The challenge for an incoming Chair is to sustain this direction of travel in a maturing market, which is very much easier said than done.  \nMy focus would be on continued growth, on choice, cost and quality for citizens and consumers, and achieved wherever possible through three priorities.  The first is competition between platforms.  If you think of the enormous success of \nsmartphones\n and tablets, this requires the freeing up of spectrum and its more intensive use, so that the mobile companies, as they roll out 4G to 99%, can really offer superfast broadband and can complement fixed fibre, but give it a run for its money on cost and speed.  \nThe second priority is competition not just between platforms but within networks and platforms where they have market power.  I would hope \nOfcom\n will focus on two ends of the supply chain: making sure that service and content providers can get fair and reasonable access to dominant networks and platforms, and at the demand end that consumers really \nhave good information about quality and cost and can switch easily, and then roll back regulation in between where possible.  \nOf course, thirdly, there are areas where competition will not do it for consumers, and my priority will be for \nOfcom\n to be speedy and effective in those areas.  One codicil: the technology means that everyone increasingly must have access to broadband as well as to phones, post and broadcasting, in which we have been used to universal access.  I regard this as particularly important, and extra important is the power that \nOfcom\n has to mandate help for the vulnerable and disadvantaged with new technology.  \n&#xa0;\nQ2 &#xa0; \nChair: Thank you.  We are going to want to come back to quite a few of those areas in perhaps a little more detail, but, before we do, you will be the first Chairman who is not trained as an economist, and \nOfcom\n is an economic regulator essentially.  Do you think that is a disadvantage?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I have spent quite a few years with the competition authorities: first of all the Mergers and Monopolies Commission, then the Competition Commission.  I have served on a wide range of panels to do with price determinations, abuse of a dominant position, mergers and so on.  I have undoubtedly brought a layman’s perspective to that, but I have both learned a great deal and found the ability to ask the possibly stupid question is an extraordinary advantage.  Those years of experience and the way they have informed obviously my career experience in the sector will be an advantage.\n&#xa0;\nQ3 &#xa0; \nChair: Select Committees have specialised in asking the obviously stupid question and have found it equally effective.  Can you just set out for us your other professional activities, both those you may have felt necessary to give up in order to take on this role and also which ones continue—which ones you intend to go on doing whilst also serving as Chairman?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: Yes, I finished as Principal of \nNewnham\n last year, and since then I have been doing the Deputy Chair of \nOfcom\n, and chairing the School Teachers’ Review Body on pay, which has been pretty demanding because there has been a total review of the teachers’ remuneration terms and conditions package.  We are completing our second report at Christmas and that will be the end of that heavy work; thereafter there will be a 1% referral from the Treasury, but that is less than a day a week.  \n&#xa0;\nQ4 &#xa0; \nChair: Do you have any other commitments?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: Not at the moment, no.  I can obviously give the undertaking that \nOfcom\n will be my main and overwhelming commitment if I am confirmed.\n&#xa0;\nQ5 &#xa0; \nChair: Thank you.  The term of this appointment has been reduced from five to three years.  Did they tell you why that was the case?  Do you think it is sensible to reduce it to what is quite a brief tenure?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I do not know why they have done so and my speculations have not hit upon an explanation.  I of course have been Deputy Chair for a couple of years, and I have the advantage, if I am confirmed, that I would hit the ground running.  I am in the middle, as it were, of some priorities that I would have the opportunity to put fresh force \nbehind.  I do think that in principle the terms for chairs of independent regulators should be of a decent period in order to reinforce their independence, and I think that is an important principle.  \n&#xa0;\nQ6 &#xa0; \nChair: Following on from that, you will be aware that Colette Bowe, who gave evidence to us a few months ago, said one of the reasons she decided not to seek a second term was she was concerned that somebody in a position of wanting a second term might be vulnerable to political pressure from the Government of the day.  Do you agree with that and do you therefore agree with her that it should be a one-term appointment?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I do agree with that, and that is certainly my current intention.\n&#xa0;\nQ7 &#xa0; \nChair: It is your intention to serve only one term?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: That is my current intention. You never know what the precise circumstances are, but I believe that is right.\n&#xa0;\nQ8 &#xa0; \nTracey Crouch: Can I just ask, coming from the outside, what you think that \nOfcom\n has done particularly well in carrying out its duties in the past, and what has it not done so well?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: The key decision that it made in its early days was functional separation of BT’s network from its retail operation.  That was the absolute key to competition for consumers and to the price falls that we have seen ever since.  The principle of that separation was taken forward with virtual unbundling of local access for broadband, which carried that on and was very well done.  \nOne of the frustrations of recent years, which I know I share with \nOfcom\n colleagues, is sometimes the difficulty of not being able to bring in measures that bring redress for consumers fast enough.  This is to do with the litigation culture in this country.  Of course, appeals must be available if regulators get it wrong, but \nOfcom\n has a particular problem, unlike some other regulators, in that its decisions can be appealed totally.  This has caused slowdowns in some of the things that it is pushed to do, and indeed the need to be even more technically precise on every issue that it embarks on.  The Government has accepted that this is a problem and there is a consultation from BIS as we speak, which may lead to improvements that will enable \nOfcom\n to speed things up.  I do think it is a priority.  \nTracey Crouch: That is something you feel very strongly about personally and you wish to see change in the future?  \nDame Patricia Hodgson: Yes\n&#xa0;\nQ9 &#xa0; \nTracey Crouch: \nOfcom’s\n responsibilities have obviously expanded since its establishment, and they will continue to do so no doubt.  How would you prioritise \nOfcom’s\n work in respect of the consumer and promoting competition in the areas it regulates?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: Promoting competition in the area it regulates is its prime duty not only under the Act but because of the benefit it brings to consumers.  \nOfcom\n has done a very good job for consumers, and if you ever have time to go to its website, you will find it is an \nabsolute cornucopia of really good advice, as well as data, that allows and helps the consumer to make good consumer decisions.  We could probably make more of that, and one of the things we need to look to is how to make people more aware of where they can get help and advice.  \nOfcom\n is not an ombudsman, so it is not the natural port of call for the consumer, and we need to make more of what we can do.  \nTracey Crouch: We found, in particular in our recent inquiry into nuisance calls, that there is\n \nquite often a misunderstanding from the consumer about how much \nOfcom\n can do.  I commend our report to you when you have a moment to read it.  \nDame Patricia Hodgson: I have read it; it is very good.\n&#xa0;\nQ10 &#xa0; \nTracey Crouch: With that in mind, how do you think that \nOfcom\n should decide when and where it is appropriate to intervene to promote competition rather than by other means?  \nDame Patricia Hodgson: There is a proper competition law process by which it assesses whether or not an organisation or service has significant market power, and, if it does, what the approach is—whether within the Competition Act it can exercise its ex ante powers, as it did with functional separation in BT, or whether it is an ex post competition decision, or a referral to the Competition Commission.  It will in a very proper process go through those formulations, according to what the issue is.  \n&#xa0;\nQ11 &#xa0; \nTracey Crouch: However, the world is changing and obviously new technologies are being introduced, and sometimes, as we found with nuisance calls, the original intention of the regulator has not necessarily kept up with technological advancements.  Do you feel this is something you will challenge in terms of thinking that \nOfcom\n should be dealing with this—that this is appropriate for \nOfcom\n?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: Absolutely.  There is a structure of pretty well permanent review, which is very heavy in resource terms.  That is determined by the EU framework, so there is a rolling program of three-year reviews of each part of the market.  However, of course, if there are consumer problems—if there is obviously public concern or a complaint—then \nOfcom\n will look at that specifically and outside its regular process of monitoring.\n&#xa0;\nQ12 &#xa0; \nTracey Crouch: One thing that is always under review is the budget, and we know that \nOfcom\n has a declining budget.  What impact do you think this will have on its ability to achieve its objectives in its annual plan and complete its other statutory functions?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: As you probably know, the budget was cut by 28% in the first spending review, and there will be another 5% before 2016.  That is one third out of its costs.  \nOfcom\n took the decision to front load the cuts, and did so with a reduction in staff, overall salary bills, reduction in premises, and a review of its processes.  It also has the advantage of the review of the regulators in general and of what value it can get from closer co-operation across the regulatory landscape.  It is certainly tight.  I observe the staff working extremely hard.  It does have to be watched, but we are confident that the quality has been retained.\n&#xa0;\nQ13 &#xa0; \nTracey Crouch: The budget has been cut, yet you are being asked to do more.  Do you think you are going to be able to go back to the Treasury and fight for \nOfcom\n and try to make sure you protect the service going forward?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: We have accepted the spending review targets and we intend to deliver to them.  Clearly, if there were a particular additional duty, we would have to negotiate for the funding of that duty.\n&#xa0;\nQ14 &#xa0; \nJim Sheridan: As I understand it, you will be on a fixed-term contract for three years, with a net of somewhere in the region of £500,000.  Is it £500,000 over three years—something like that?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I believe the Minister has set the remuneration at £142,500 per annum.\n&#xa0;\nQ15 &#xa0; \nJim Sheridan: You will not be applying for Jobseeker’s Allowance then?  The point I am making is: if you do not reach your objectives, what measures are in place so that the taxpayer has value for money?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I would imagine this Committee would have a great deal to say about it.  There would be enormous pressure in the press, and, if appointed, were I to be a failure, the normal result of failure would follow, I imagine.\n&#xa0;\nQ16 &#xa0; \nJim Sheridan: What would be that result?  I mean, we live with that pressure every day if we do not deliver.  \nDame Patricia Hodgson: Yes.  It is, as I am finding this morning, quite a high profile role in which one cannot afford to fail.\n&#xa0;\nQ17 &#xa0; \nJim Sheridan: I would not like to take the chance but, anyway, the\n other thing is there is a distinct possibility that the \nUK\n could be broken up next year with Scottish independence.  If indeed that happens, a significant proportion of your work would go with it.  Therefore, you would have a lot less work to do, but still get the same salary.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: There are many unknown developments in relation to Scottish independence.  If that does not happen, there is devolution, European changes in regulation—it is very difficult to predict what the balance of requirements will be.  \nOfcom\n is such a fast-moving political and \nsectoral\n situation.  \n&#xa0;\nQ18 &#xa0; \nMr Leech: This job is a three-day-a-week job.  Why is it a three-day-a-week job and not a five-day-a-week job?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: It varies of course.  It can, as it was at times last year for Colette Bowe, be more than three days a week.  It is the distinction between the role of the non-executives, who really must make sure they are in a position to take an overview and to see the wood for the trees, and the position of the executives, who are working certainly more than five days a week, in my observation, but are engaged in the day-to-day managerial and operational role.  There is a danger in non-executives being drawn too close to the detail, \nbecause they do then tend not to see the bigger picture, which is what this Committee and the public expect them to focus on and take action if something is astray.\n&#xa0;\nQ19 &#xa0; \nMr Leech: \nOfcom\n has taken on additional responsibilities.  There has been talk potentially of taking on more responsibilities.  Is there anything you think that \nOfcom\n might take on that would then require your job as Chairman to be a full-time, rather than part-time, job?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: As you know, both Colette Bowe and Ed Richards have made it very clear that \nOfcom\n is not ambitious for more responsibilities.\nMr Leech: That may be thrust upon them.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: It may be thrust upon them, in which case everybody involved will work as is required to make sure any responsibilities are fully and professionally carried out.\n&#xa0;\nQ20 &#xa0; \nMr Leech: Could you foresee any additional responsibilities that \nOfcom\n might take on that would require the job of Chairman to be a full-time, rather than part-time, role?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I would not say full time; all I would say is that whatever comes before \nOfcom\n, and last year it was my observation that Colette was certainly at periods working five days, it comes and goes.  As we were saying, it is impossible to know, with the combination of decisions this place might make, devolution and independence decisions, of issues that blow up in the industry.  It is impossible to know at any one time.\n&#xa0;\nQ21 &#xa0; \nMr Leech: With that level of uncertainty, is it difficult to do a part-time job that might effectively become more than three days a week and have other outside responsibilities?  You said that you do another role.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: Yes, which between Christmas and May will be slightly less than one day a week, and at that juncture I will have the ability to decide whether or not to continue with it.  As I said, my prime commitment is to \nOfcom\n, and I will make sure that I always have the ability for that to be the case, having seen how the burden of it varies.\n&#xa0;\nQ22 &#xa0; \nMr Leech: I think you said you have been Deputy Chair for two years?  \nDame Patricia Hodgson: Yes.  \n&#xa0;\nQ23 &#xa0; \nMr Leech: Obviously, through the Deputy Chair you have been in a position to see what decisions have been made by the Chair and the direction of travel in which the Chair has chosen to take \nOfcom\n as the Chairman.  Is there anything that, if you had been the Chairman over the last five years, you would have done differently?  \nDame Patricia Hodgson: There certainly is not anything over the last two years.  I am a great admirer of \nOfcom\n, and while I might not be across every detail of its history prior to my being part of it, I cannot give you anything of which I heartily disapprove.\n&#xa0;\nQ24 &#xa0; \nMr Leech: In that case, if you have approved all the decisions made in your time as Deputy Chair, what differences will you bring to \nOfcom\n?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: As I said, the market is maturing all the time.  Individuals bring particular strengths and priorities.  I said in my answer to the first question that I am particularly interested in competition.  As the market matures and these big companies come together—we have seen a full-page spread in the \nFinancial Times\n this morning about cable companies coming together, and there is a lot of speculation about AT&amp;T and Verizon, Vodafone, \nTalkTalk\n and so on—my priorities in the field of competition might be particularly useful going forward.  \nSpectrum is clearly a huge issue.  One of the strengths I had when I arrived at \nOfcom\n was I had line management responsibility for the policy engineers in R and D at the BBC.  While I am not an engineer or a spectrum expert, again I knew where to ask the lay questions and to push them.  When there was a great deal of pushback from the companies on the design of the auction, I felt confident in saying to the board, “We cannot anticipate every business variation for the companies over the next five years.  We have to go with the best we can do at the time.  It will stand up in court.”  Spectrum is going to be a big issue; I bring something there.  Obviously, I have a very strong broadcasting background, and that is ever with us.\n&#xa0;\nQ25 &#xa0; \nChair: The Government published its communications draft paper, and identified various changes that it was contemplating in legislation. Indeed, Colette Bowe and Ed Richards talked to us previously about the need to perhaps update legislation, but it does not look as if that will happen in the immediate future at least.  Do you think that will make \nOfcom’s\n work harder?  Or do you see there are definite areas where you would like to see some amendment of legislation?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: DCMS seem to be taking forward the areas of most concern.  We talked about the appeals framework.  There are specific and detailed concerns about things like our powers in relation to consumers switching when a broadcasting package is involved, and we are in discussions with DCMS over that.  There are ongoing discussions about our powers in relation to due prominence on front pages and EPGs.  The DCMS is very willing and open to finding routes where possible to taking forward those issues that were felt to be of concern and might have been in legislation.\n&#xa0;\nQ26 &#xa0; \nChair: You mean finding alternative ways short of primary legislation?  \nDame Patricia Hodgson: Yes.\nChair: Perhaps on one or two of the ones you just mentioned, I will hand over to Angie Bray.\n&#xa0;\nQ27 &#xa0; \nAngie Bray: You touched on switching, and also touched on the fact that you think that competition is the biggest issue.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: Pressure.\nAngie Bray: Pressure, exactly.  Of course, switching is all about that.  I know \nOfcom\n has said for some years now that it is one of their biggest targets, if that is the right word, and yet we still fail to get anywhere with it.  We need to get this provider led.  Are we still going \nto be waiting another five years?  What is happening?  Why are we still not getting anywhere?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: The provider-led switching for fixed lines is well under way now, and the next priority is mobiles.  As you probably know, the issue is that, when \nOfcom\n has to exercise its powers, it has to pass tests of detriment harm for the consumer and proportionality and the costs to the provider, so it has to go through a frustratingly slow process of making sure it is absolutely copper-bottomed safe as far as an appeal may go, but that is well in train.  The problem—the one I referred to in answer to the Chairman’s question—is that we do not have those powers when it comes to broadcasting and, of course, increasingly, providers are bundling the telecoms and the broadcast, so that needs to be solved for us with Government help, otherwise it will continue to be years.  This is a real problem.\n&#xa0;\nQ28 &#xa0; \nAngie Bray: You talk about the fact you are getting it sorted with fixed lines, but of course the number of people using fixed lines is falling, so in a sense that is not where the pressure is.  It is clearly the mobile market.  What you are really saying is that the risk of litigation remains the main reason we cannot move forward.  Is that correct?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: It is the main hurdle with speed in issues like this.\n&#xa0;\nQ29 &#xa0; \nAngie Bray: Effectively, what you are saying is that, while that is unresolved, we are not going to get better competition.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: We are moving, and you will have seen last week movement on 0800 numbers, and getting 0800 numbers free on mobiles.  I asked the question, “Why is it taking so flipping long?” and the answer of course was the answer I have just given you on switching.  These things take too long, but we work relentlessly to make them happen.\n&#xa0;\nQ30 &#xa0; \nAngie Bray: What are you going to do differently?  What extra pressure can you bring to bear?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I can certainly ask the questions that you are asking and that I have been asking, and work, I hope, with DCMS to ensure we can unblock some of these roadblocks.\n&#xa0;\nQ31 &#xa0; \nAngie Bray: Would I be right in thinking that in \nEurope\n there is not such a problem, and that provider-led switching is actually available?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I cannot tell you for every European country, I am afraid.  \n&#xa0;\nQ32 &#xa0; \nAngie Bray: It certainly is, I think, available in Europe, so why are we lagging behind \nEurope\n?  They must have the same sort of pressures.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: No, \nOfcom\n has a particular problem.  As I understand it, it is the only regulator in this country where, because of the detail of the legislation, our decisions can be appealed in total—totally reheard—and that is why there is a particular problem for us.\n&#xa0;\nQ33 &#xa0; \nAngie Bray: Given that it may be possible to do it in \nEurope\n, it does sound sometimes like that is just a little bit of an excuse—hiding behind the fact it is incredibly complicated and it is all very detailed.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: Well, I hope it is not.\nAngie Bray: Consumers want progress on this, and I hope you are going to say, “As the new Chairman, that is my number one.”\nDame Patricia Hodgson:  In my first answer to John, I said speed is of the essence.\nAngie Bray: And is this your number one?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: It is one of my top priorities.\n&#xa0;\nQ34 &#xa0; \nMr Sutcliffe: Can I just follow that through, because I think the European point was well made—that it is easier to switch mobile providers in Europe than it is in the \nUK\n.  \nOfcom\n has said for the last three years that it is a priority.  In fact it has got harder to switch.  In \nEurope\n, the provider has got to get in touch with the competitor and it is all done for the consumer.  Here we have to get the permission of the provider to change.  I accept what you are saying in terms of the legal challenge there, but surely \nOfcom\n can put pressure on the various providers to do something—a code of practice or something—to make it even easier, but it should not be hard.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I agree with you.  It should not be the case.  The issue of provider led is in train for fixed lines; it is the next priority for mobiles, and then we have the real problem of ensuring we can do it for packages.  \n&#xa0;\nQ35 &#xa0; \nMr Sutcliffe: I think it is a commitment to help you from this Committee that we will be looking at this very closely, because, as I say, it seems to have got harder rather than easier, and providers are making it more difficult.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I switched my bank account shortly after it was supposed to have been the new, wonderful, one-week effort; a year later, I am still struggling.\n&#xa0;\nQ36 &#xa0; \nJim Sheridan: Can I just quickly follow up on a question?  I think you said in terms of switching in \nEurope\n that it is frustrating, it takes too long and is complicated, etc.  In answer to Angie Bray’s question, what are you going to do that your predecessor did not do?  Or is that a slight on your predecessor?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: The provider-led solution has been consulted on and agreed on and is coming in.  We are talking about the frustration of the time these things take to make them watertight. I absolutely agree with the frustrations of the Committee, and I think my colleagues do too, and we will do everything in our power to solve this.\n&#xa0;\nQ37 &#xa0; \nJim Sheridan: Your predecessor probably said that.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I do not know whether she did.\n&#xa0;\nQ38 &#xa0; \nJim Sheridan: \nWhat are you going to do to make it happen?\nDame Patricia Hodgson:  It is happening.\n&#xa0;\nQ39 &#xa0; \nJim Sheridan: W\nhat are you going to do to speed it up then?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I hope I have made my commitment to this pretty clear.\nJim Sheridan: \nNot to me,\n you haven’\nt.\n&#xa0;\nQ40 &#xa0; \nChair: As an aside—your predecessor and chief executive will be familiar with this—and as one who had his account switched without his knowledge, authorisation or wish, there is an alternative concern, which is to protect people against slamming of that kind. It took me a week to get it back again.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: Yes.\n&#xa0;\nQ41 &#xa0; \nPaul Farrelly: This, Chair, is an issue I raised with the chief executive, having had similar experiences in the energy markets, where the account has been switched without my knowledge. There is no obligation on the new provider to check out the identity of the person claiming to be the customer at the address, and that can lead to all sorts of problems, if identity fraud is at the heart of it—generating statements as proof of address, and then you can get problems with credit agencies, if they successfully defraud credit providers. There is another side to it.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: There are terrific increased problems with the way huge technological databases can be used.  It is a real growing problem.\nChair: I expect we might return to this at another time.\n&#xa0;\nQ42 &#xa0; \nPaul Farrelly: This is a thought about mobile telecoms, for those of us who are actually lucky enough to travel.  How important in \nOfcom’s\n scale of priorities is progressing towards a competitive and complete, integrated European market in telecoms?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: We are very pleased to see the direction of Connected Europe\n, and working very hard with DCMS, obviously representing the \nUK\n there, to make sure this is carried forward in the most practical way.\n&#xa0;\nQ43 &#xa0; \nPaul Farrelly: Let me give you one example.  I will not name the company.  I have been a customer of a particular leading mobile company for nearly 20 years, and the package is not cheap, quite frankly.  I have kept it because of inertia and all the difficulties you can have in switching over and the wish to retain a mobile number.  \nWhen I go abroad to \nEurope\n, sometimes accidentally I get hit\n \nwith roaming and mobile data charges because I press the wrong button, but you get constant text messages that for an extra £3 you can pay to go on this extra charge-free tariff.  To my mind, why not just include that in my not-so-cheap tariff anyway and charge me £3 only if I go over it?  What sort of measures can \nOfcom\n in the current environment take to persuade mobile telephone companies that actually that is the route they should be taking rather than just penalising customers?  \nDame Patricia Hodgson: As you say, the overarching solution is the long-term cross-national end to roaming charges.  In the interim, \nOfcom\n draws these issues to the attention of \nthe mobile operators with unfailing determination.  I know you do not have time, but if you were to look at the website, there is some really good advice about avoiding some of the traps.\n&#xa0;\nQ44 &#xa0; \nPaul Farrelly: What action can \nOfcom\n take?  Frankly, while they are all doing it, there is not actually much choice.  What action can \nOfcom\n take to intervene?  \nDame Patricia Hodgson: As you know, going the competition route has enabled \nOfcom\n, as I began by saying, to roll back regulation, and we do not regulate retail prices.  Clearly, if there were huge problems that could not be solved in any other way, that would have to be revisited, but we do have a route, with determination at last from DG Connect and \nEurope\n, to solve this, and we will put all our efforts behind that to speed it up.\n&#xa0;\nQ45 &#xa0; \nPaul Farrelly: In the meantime, do you think it should also be a priority for Government to ease \nOfcom’s\n ability to intervene?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: On this particular issue, I think we are going in the right direction, and I think that probably all efforts should focus on getting rid of these roaming charges.  It seems to me to be the best solution.\n&#xa0;\nQ46 &#xa0; \nMr Leech: How well do you think \nOfcom\n has done in supporting the Government’s strategy for superfast broadband rollout?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: It is, obviously, a high priority for \nOfcom\n.  An enormous amount of work has been done in identifying where there are coverage problems over the past year, particularly in rural areas.  A lot of work is being done at the moment on cities, because there is a widespread assumption that, if you live in a city, your superfast connection will be fine.  There are gaps and there will be some reports after Christmas about that, enabling the Government, local authorities and private groups that want to help solve these problems, where it is beyond the normal rollout, to be as effective as possible, so it is a high priority.\n&#xa0;\nQ47 &#xa0; \nMr Leech: Will there be any discussions within \nOfcom\n about how to deal with the massive discrepancy in some areas?  For instance, there are some rural counties where, by 2016, coverage in some districts will still be less than 80%, and then, in others, it will be massively over 90%.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: The most effective thing we can do is to make sure that information about that kind of discrepancy is available to the authorities.\n&#xa0;\nQ48 &#xa0; \nMr Leech: I think that information is already available.  People know that, in certain areas, it is just not going to be available.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: It will, eventually, under the Government’s programme, of course.  That is why I made such a strong emphasis on mobile coverage, because that will complement and complete some of the final fixed-network not-spots or not-areas.\n&#xa0;\nQ49 &#xa0; \nMr Leech: In your view, then, in some of these rural areas, there is an alternative solution to the current programme of rollout.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: The whole idea of the design of the 4G auction and the 99% coverage target, and of the current spectrum work to ensure that those services will be seriously high speed, is both to complement fixed fibre and to challenge BT with rollout and customer service.\n&#xa0;\nQ50 &#xa0; \nMr Leech: You said earlier on, in answer to some questions about how important competition was, that, within the rollout of broadband, BT have won, I think, all the contracts that have been given so far and are likely to win all the future contracts as well.  Is that good competition there?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I think that is probably a question for BDUK.\n&#xa0;\nQ51 &#xa0; \nMr Leech: Do you not have a view, as the incoming Chairman of \nOfcom\n, about whether or not that is good competition?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I began by saying that there is always a question about competition where there is an incumbent with significant market power.  I am not going to be drawn further into questions that I think have been asked pretty effectively by the PAC on that topic.\n&#xa0;\nQ52 &#xa0; \nMr Leech: You do not think it is appropriate for you to have an opinion on that as the incoming Chairman.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I think I have suggested the importance I place on the performance of the incumbent and of the importance of competition, so that the incumbent is challenged to perform well.\n&#xa0;\nQ53 &#xa0; \nMr Leech: Is there anything that \nOfcom\n might suggest in the future to make it easier in those sorts of circumstances for there to be better competition when there is a company that is a dominant player?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I am sure we will do all that we can to support BDUK and to advise them on the cost information they need and on the structure of tenders—and, of course, \nOfcom\n is currently undertaking one of its triennial reviews on fixed-fibre networks and VULA. That is all relevant.\n&#xa0;\nQ54 &#xa0; \nChair: Just following on from that, \nOfcom\n, in the past, has gone out of its way to increase the number of providers in the mobile-telephony market to increase competition.  Do you have any view as to how many telecoms companies there should be in order to have a properly competitive market?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I do not think I can give you a number.  I think, in each market situation, you look at the likely contenders and you do your best to ensure that it is a reasonable number in the situation and, if possible, that there is a hungry contender—an entrant that challenges the others, so that it does not become a cosy group.  That is the policy \nthat was pursued with the last spectrum auction, and I commend it, wherever possible, in the future.\n&#xa0;\nQ55 &#xa0; \nChair: In the broadband market and the history of introducing competition, we had a long battle over local-loop unbundling some time ago.  We have reached the point where BT now has to wholesale their copper wire, and the price is regulated.  That is not the case in fibre.  Do you think there needs to be intervention to ensure that there is a properly competitive market in fibre?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: This is a very live issue for all sorts of reasons, not least, of course, with BT’s foray into sport and all the questions that have been asked as a result of that.  It is one of the questions at the core of this triennial review I have mentioned on a couple of occasions.  It is also, of course, before \nOfcom\n because of a margin-squeeze complaint from \nTalkTalk\n.  I think I can say, without anticipating any outcome in any way, that it is a proper and live matter of review.\n&#xa0;\nQ56 &#xa0; \nChair: One on which, however, you are not willing to express an opinion.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I do not believe I can; it is under review by our Competition department.\n&#xa0;\nQ57 &#xa0; \nChair: You just touched on BT’s expansion into content provision and the amount of money that they are spending on that content.  To what extent do you think that is a proper subject for \nOfcom\n to consider in relation to BT’s regulated activities?  What BT spends on content is a matter for BT.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: It arises in two separate and overlapping areas.  One of the things I have discovered about \nOfcom\n is you may think that there are different buckets of issues, and they do intertwine in a very significant way.\nChair: I am just trying to think of an intertwining bucket.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: Yes; it is not a metaphor that is going anywhere, is it?  \nThe review, obviously, will look at all the elements of VULA and how common costs are charged and so on.  If you look at the other end of the question, which is about sports rights and how the sports market has developed in this country, there is a hierarchy of decisions that affect that: in the first instance, how generous listed-events decisions are, which are taken by Parliament; in the second instance, how the football rights are divided up, and they have chosen to carry on with the way they are divided following the EU decisions in 2004.  Then there becomes a matter for \nOfcom\n as to whether there is a dominant platform.  \nIn the case of \nBSkyB\n, \nOfcom\n found, in 2010, that it was dominant in the pay-TV market, and, of course, it mandated wholesale must-offer of its sports channels to BT.  All those elements feed into decisions that are proper matters for \nOfcom\n and, of course, affect the shape of the market overall.\n&#xa0;\nQ58 &#xa0; \nChair: Do you see \nOfcom\n as having a say in all of these things?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: It has a say in the final bit of that hierarchy. Listed events are a matter for Parliament, the EU, but the determination of whether a platform is dominant in a particular market is clearly a proper matter for \nOfcom\n.  It gets litigated, of course.  We may or may not be right, but it is undoubtedly a proper matter for it to consider.\n&#xa0;\nQ59 &#xa0; \nMr Bradshaw: Given your long and distinguished career at the BBC, how can you reassure other broadcasters and, indeed, the rest of the media landscape that you are going to conduct this role in an unbiased way?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I was the broadcasting regulator for four years at the ITC after I had left executive employment at the BBC.  I dealt with all the broadcasters, including complaints against the BBC and from the BBC.  There was never a whisper, a piece of press coverage or an accusation from any part of the sector that I was anything other than impartial, independent and professional, and I take pride in that.\n&#xa0;\nQ60 &#xa0; \nMr Bradshaw: You will know that the current regulatory structure of the BBC is quite a hot topic.  It has been considered repeatedly by this Committee and, just this week, Margaret Hodge of the Public Accounts Committee questioned whether the current regulatory system was a sensible one.  Have you ever expressed a view about the current regulatory structure and the possibility of \nOfcom\n taking on more responsibility?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I have not expressed a view about \nOfcom\n taking on any responsibility.  Would it be helpful, to get into this line of discussion, if I just spent a moment talking about my experience on the Trust with particular reference to salaries?  \nI joined the Trust in 2007, when it was set up.  That was an appointment in which Michael Grade played a part.  Then, of course, Michael went to ITV and there was a bit of a hiatus, and it took a bit of time, I think, for the Trust to settle the different set of responsibilities and powers from the Governors.  It did one or two good things: it stopped the BBC expanding into local television; it closed down BBC Jam.  \nOne of the things that I found difficult and a problem was what I observed had happened to BBC salaries between the time I had left the BBC and what I then saw, which was a significant rise, and an increase in the number of senior staff—in some cases, a doubling of salaries.  I and one or two members of the Trust were very strong on this and made ourselves very unpopular.  Over time, we brought the Trust to a united position on that and, in 2009, they required the BBC, by a balance of reducing numbers and reducing salaries, to cut that expenditure by 25%.  \nIt was then that it became clear there was a structural issue, which was that the Trust had the power under the new charter to set a strategic direction, but it did not receive individual information about remuneration or payoffs, and that that power and activity took place in \nthe \nRems\n Committee as part of the management board.  At the time, I was very uncomfortable with that and I remain of the view that it is an issue.\n&#xa0;\nQ61 &#xa0; \nMr Bradshaw: It sounds to me as if you would be quite open to the idea of \nOfcom\n taking on more responsibility for regulating the BBC, which is widely supported, not least by Michael Grade himself now, in retrospect.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I think you have unpack what you mean by that, because a lot of people, when they say, “\nOfcom\n could regulate the BBC,” think of it in terms of the whole package.  They think of it in terms of, I suppose, the three areas in which this Committee would wish the BBC to be accountable: funding, governance and regulation.  Funding, of course, is a matter, we have seen, for the NAO, and I am pleased to see more powers for the NAO.  I think that is very proper.  The overall funding of the BBC and licence renewal would be, quite properly, a decision for Parliament.  \nGovernance, which is about holding the management for account for what it is doing day to day, in my experience, needs to be close to the managers who are being managed, and is probably separate from regulation.  \nOfcom\n has some regulatory powers over the BBC.  At present, its broadcasting code applies in areas of harm, taste and decency, not accuracy and impartiality.  I think that, when my colleagues have talked about regulation, they have been talking about that, so I think it is important to make the distinction.\n&#xa0;\nQ62 &#xa0; \nMr Bradshaw: I repeat: it sounds to me as if you would be quite open to the idea and, of course, you have to be impartial in these matters, but do you think it would be a problem, if this Government or a future Government decided to shift some of the regulatory responsibilities to \nOfcom\n, that you have a BBC background, in terms of your ability to do that work robustly and objectively?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: My first part of my answer is that I personally, and \nOfcom\n in general, have no ambitions to move in that direction.  Should Parliament require activities on the regulatory side, you would clearly do what was required.  I think I have given an answer about my experience at the ITC, and I do not think that is a problem.  I think the issue of governance and regulation is a proper matter for the charter debate, and something different.\n&#xa0;\nQ63 &#xa0; \nMr Bradshaw: Will you express a view, and will you lobby, either privately or publicly, for or against that shift in competence?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I have made a very clear distinction between regulation and the governance on the funding side.  We clearly do regulation for the rest of the sector.\n&#xa0;\nQ64 &#xa0; \nMr Bradshaw: You would not, however, resist being given more responsibility.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: There is no ambition to do it.  If asked, Ed Richards has said that \nOfcom\n could do it.  I really must emphasise there are no tanks on lawns.  There is no ambition on \nOfcom’s\n part.  It is a matter for this place.\n&#xa0;\nQ65 &#xa0; \nMr Bradshaw: In 2008, while you were a member of the BBC Trust, you said, “There is a need to guarantee competition for the BBC in public service.”  However, you strongly advocated keeping use of the licence fee exclusively for the BBC, describing using any of it for others’ public-service content “as though a tax were imposed on Marks &amp; Spencer to subsidise competition from \nAsda\n”.  Is that still your view about the use of the licence fee?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: It is very different circumstances.  It is not a matter for \nOfcom\n and I think, with your permission, Chairman, I will say it is a hypothetical question for me.\n&#xa0;\nQ66 &#xa0; \nMr Bradshaw: It is not hypothetical \nany more\n, because this Government have used the licence fee to fund local TV.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: It is not a matter for \nOfcom\n.\n&#xa0;\nQ67 &#xa0; \nMr Bradshaw: You would not, then, resist, in terms of how you respond to the consultation around charter review, a proposal for the licence fee to be spread more easily across public-service broadcasting.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I cannot anticipate what \nOfcom\n would feel it proper to comment on in a charter consultation that we know not what it will be at this stage.\n&#xa0;\nQ68 &#xa0; \nMr Bradshaw: How would you see your role in terms of encouraging competition to the BBC?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: Whatever is the proper role for \nOfcom\n.  As you know, at present the Trust can determine that some development is of strategic importance, and then it refers a market-impact assessment to \nOfcom\n.  We are in discussion with them at present about whether any of Tony Hall’s new plans will require that sort of activity and, should the decision be that it does, \nOfcom\n will undertake a market-impact assessment, and that is perfectly proper.\n&#xa0;\nQ69 &#xa0; \nPaul Farrelly: You said that, when you were at the BBC Trust, you were uncomfortable at remuneration decisions, apart from the Director General, and payoffs being decided by the Remuneration Committee.  At the BBC Trust, can I ask you how you expressed that discomfort?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: Frequently, and at most Trust meetings.\n&#xa0;\nQ70 &#xa0; \nPaul Farrelly: That is quite clear—and loudly?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: Indeed.\n&#xa0;\nQ71 &#xa0; \nPaul Farrelly: What reception did that frequent and loud discomfort get?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: As I said, it was not popular at first.  After a period, certainly the Trust was united in its concern about the overall direction.\n&#xa0;\nQ72 &#xa0; \nPaul Farrelly: With whom was it not popular?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: It certainly was not popular with the executive.  Eventually, the Trust became united in its approach.  The pressure exerted was described in the press as “ferocious”.\n&#xa0;\nQ73 &#xa0; \nPaul Farrelly: It was not really described in that way by the Public Accounts Committee this week.  The Public Accounts Committee was quite scathing about a culture of cronyism amongst the top managers, but it was also pretty critical about the remoteness of the BBC Trust and its members from what was going on.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: Yes.  I made an answer in response to Mr Bradshaw where I said that I felt governance was most effective when it was close to management, and that remains my view.  I should add—and I do not think I am breaching any confidences here—structural problems can be overcome when there is a good relationship between the chairman and the chief executive.  The chairman/chief executive relationship is pivotal in any organisation.  You may have seen the evidence given at the PAC when Mark Thompson and Michael Lyons were there, so I am not breaching any confidences when I say that relationship had broken down.\n&#xa0;\nQ74 &#xa0; \nMr Bradshaw: Does that not say something to you about the structure of the organisation, or was it just personalities?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: There were certainly personalities involved.  It is on television—you saw it.  I said I was uncomfortable with some of the structural pressures.  My general experience in other organisations and over many years is that effective governance needs to be close to management, and crucial are the relationships that are the pivot of those structures.  They can be better or worse with different people involved.\n&#xa0;\nQ75 &#xa0; \nMr Bradshaw: What you seem to be implying by that is that, in the case of the BBC, with its current structure with the Trust, the board is not close enough to the management to deliver good governance, because it is in this odd relationship with the Trust.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I have talked about my experience when I was on the Trust.  I do not think I can answer about what has happened since, and I do observe or I read in the papers about great efforts being made by the new director general and the chairman to make the current constitutional arrangements work as effectively as possible.\n&#xa0;\nQ76 &#xa0; \nPaul Farrelly: Just on governance, could I just ask you for one further opinion, because of your experience of a wide range of governance structures?  What effective role, did you feel, when you were on the BBC Trust, was played by the non-executive directors of the BBC?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: It is not really a question I can answer, because, as has been observed, different roles were played by the executive board and by the Trust.\n&#xa0;\nQ77 &#xa0; \nPaul Farrelly: The BBC, however, has non-executive directors.  Did you not notice them making a noticeable difference?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I cannot answer that.  They worked within the management board, and the director general attended the Trust meetings and accounted for BBC decisions.  I am not privy to what went on within the board where the non-execs were present.\n&#xa0;\nQ78 &#xa0; \nPaul Farrelly: Again on the BBC, this is, I hope, one of the bigger-picture questions.  You talked about the importance of non-executives having an eye for the bigger picture.  One of the concerns about the BBC has always been BBC creep: that it just extends itself and extends itself, and forces out competition.  Another concern is about the way it uses public money.  \nBoth of those concerns came together with the magnificent acquisition of BBC Worldwide, about which we were very critical in 2009, when you were a member of the Trust, and all those criticisms have come home to roost—if criticism can roost.  Do you recall having any opinion about that particular transaction undertaken by the BBC when you were on the Trust?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I thought it could be used as a real advantage if the public-service coverage—everything from travel to David Attenborough—could be joined in a way that came together with the commercial services and was made available on a commercial basis around the world.  That did not happen; I regret it.\n&#xa0;\nQ79 &#xa0; \nPaul Farrelly: My final question, if I might, Chairman, is on a different subject.  Lord Justice \nLeveson\n recommended that, were his proposals implemented, any publisher such as United Newspapers, with the Press Complaints Commission, would have \nOfcom\n as a backstop regulator.  That has not come to pass because we have a Royal Charter, but if the Royal Charter and the system of regulation is found wanting in the future, very shortly, when parties are drawing up their manifestos, they will be thinking about what happens next.  What is your view about \nOfcom\n possibly, in the future, becoming a backstop regulator for the press?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: \nOfcom\n made it very clear at the time that it had no desire or ambition to regulate the press.  I strongly agreed with that.  My own personal opinion—this is not an \nOfcom\n opinion—is that you do not want a single regulator that has power over too wide an area of media.\n&#xa0;\nQ80 &#xa0; \nPaul Farrelly: If, in the future, \nOfcom\n were asked to take on that task, however, would you resist it?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I think I have made my personal position clear.  \nOfcom\n can never, of course, refuse what it is instructed to do.\n&#xa0;\nQ81 &#xa0; \nChair: Just before I bring in Philip, can I just come back very quickly to what you were saying about your period on the BBC Trust?  You said that it became very apparent in the televised hearing that the relationship between Michael Lyons and Mark Thompson had broken down.  That, of course, was long after Michael Lyons had left and Mark Thompson had left.  Essentially, then, for a quite a period, the BBC was not being governed properly, yet nobody did anything about it at the time.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I think I have described my experience and what I observed.  Michael Lyons did not serve a second term.  I really do not think I have anything to add to my answer.\nChair: It may be something we will revisit in the inquiry that we are starting in the new year.\n&#xa0;\nQ82 &#xa0; \nPhilip Davies: I have heard you talk a lot about your discomfort, but I did not really hear a straight answer to the question, which may be because I did not hear it rather than you did not say it.  Can you just tell us, however, what you think about the effectiveness of the BBC Trust in regulating the BBC?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I have told you what I felt when I was a member of the Trust.  I am not, and have not since then, been close to it, and I think it would be wrong for \nOfcom\n to express an opinion.\n&#xa0;\nQ83 &#xa0; \nPhilip Davies: I am not asking \nOfcom\n to express an opinion; I am asking you to express an opinion.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: Yes, but you see the problem.\n&#xa0;\nQ84 &#xa0; \nPhilip Davies: No, I do not.  I want to know what your opinion is.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I think I have been pretty clear about what my opinion was when I was in a position to know.\n&#xa0;\nQ85 &#xa0; \nPhilip Davies: I am not really interested in whether or not you think Sir Michael Lyons’ and Mark Thompson’s relationship had broken down or all that kind of jazz; what I am really interested in is the more general point—that is, is the BBC Trust capable of effectively regulating the BBC?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I read in the newspapers in the past week that the incoming director general, with whom I worked in the 1990s and in whom I have much faith, has taken a number of steps that, I hope, on behalf of the public and as a viewer of television and a payer of the licence fee, will be effective.  I have mentioned that I believe there are structural problems with the constitution of the Trust.  I have also said that I think, in organisations, good relationships can go a long way to help when there are such problems.  I think all of us hope that the current arrangements can be made to work until there is a fundamental review of the charter, when there has been time to see how that has panned out.\n&#xa0;\nQ86 &#xa0; \nPhilip Davies: Just to be specific, one of the main criticisms that is made of the BBC Trust, and one of the points that is raised as to why it cannot work, or does not work, is this idea that it is impossible to be a cheerleader and a regulator of the same organisation.  What is your view on that?  Do you believe it is impossible to be a cheerleader and a regulator?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I have always been puzzled by that, because any board is in the same dilemma, is it not?  An integrated plc board is accountable for the organisation but will naturally defend it, and it has to reach a balance.\n&#xa0;\nQ87 &#xa0; \nPhilip Davies: It is not a regulator of it, though, is it?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: No, because there are shareholders.  Any structure you can think of, however, for the effective governance of the BBC would have some element of that in it.  I think that what you are really getting at is: what is the structure that would deliver the \ngreatest assurance of accountability?  I welcome what we hear about your saying you are going to look thoroughly into the charter in the run-up to the new charter debate.\n&#xa0;\nQ88 &#xa0; \nPhilip Davies: Just to be clear, however, you believe that you can be a cheerleader for an organisation and a regulator of the organisation.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: No, I did not say that.  I said I am puzzled.  I am not quite sure what the sound bite means.  Assuming it is about the importance of accountability, I then think we get into discussions about the most effective structures that would ensure accountability.\n&#xa0;\nQ89 &#xa0; \nPhilip Davies: Could you tell us what the size of your BBC pension is?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: It is a matter of public record that, when I left the BBC in 2000, my entitlement after 30 years’ service and after paying in for that time and making a maximum number of added years’ voluntary contributions was £119,000.\n&#xa0;\nQ90 &#xa0; \nPhilip Davies: A year?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: Yes.\n&#xa0;\nQ91 &#xa0; \nPhilip Davies: You get that from the BBC.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: That is my entitlement.  It is a matter of public record.\n&#xa0;\nQ92 &#xa0; \nPhilip Davies: That is what you get each year from the BBC.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: That is my entitlement.\n&#xa0;\nQ93 &#xa0; \nPhilip Davies: No, I am not asking whether you are entitled.  Is that something that you get every year from the BBC?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I regret to say that I am of pensionable age and I take a BBC pension.\n&#xa0;\nQ94 &#xa0; \nPhilip Davies: Given that you, in effect, take £119,000 a year from the BBC, and that, potentially, within your term of office as chairman of \nOfcom\n, you could be the regulator of the BBC, do you not think that that is rather too much of a conflict of interest?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I am of that very fortunate generation.  You see the headlines this morning about generational differences.  I am of that fortunate generation that had the opportunity to work for big companies that had final-salary pension schemes.  If you paid into those final-salary pension schemes and were lucky enough to be employed for most of your professional career, and if you were further fortunate in that you became quite senior, you had this extraordinary privilege of the security that a final-salary pension scheme brings.  I know about that.  My father had no pension and I know how important it is.  It is a pension that is paid by a pension trust.  It brings with it an independence.  I believe it brings with it an independence of judgment, which I am very privileged to have.\n&#xa0;\nQ95 &#xa0; \nPhilip Davies: Whether you think it brings with it independence, do you not think that the public would think that a vested interest comes with it?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I think most people understand about pensions and, as I said, I have a track record of independence over many years.  If I am confirmed in this job, it would be my business for it to be clear beyond peradventure that I am independent.\n&#xa0;\nQ96 &#xa0; \nPhilip Davies: Unless you have a habit of changing your mind on things. Mr Bradshaw gave a quote from what you said before about the exclusive use of the licence fee for the BBC.  Do you not think, if you piece all these pieces of the jigsaw together, it might undermine your credibility as a regulator of the BBC, should that happen in the future?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: It did not undermine my credibility as a regulator of the broadcasting sector when I was at the ITC, and the proof of the pudding was in the eating.  We have had a long discussion about what \nOfcom’s\n responsibilities could possibly be in the future.  On the aspect of regulation and on broadcasting codes etc., not only is there a track record, but I just do not believe that is the case.\n&#xa0;\nQ97 &#xa0; \nPhilip Davies: Might it not be seen that, if you were the regulator of the BBC, you would also be a cheerleader and a regulator of the BBC?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: There are an awful lot of “ifs” in that long chain of hypothetical possibilities.  I am stating my commitment to independence and my proven track record.  This is not unproven; the past track record is not hypothetical.\n&#xa0;\nQ98 &#xa0; \nPhilip Davies: How many days a week do you work as Deputy Chairman of \nOfcom\n?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: About two and a half.\n&#xa0;\nQ99 &#xa0; \nPhilip Davies: Two and a half days, and you get £70,000 a year for two and a half days.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: Yes.\n&#xa0;\nQ100 &#xa0; \nPhilip Davies: You are, then, going to work up to three days a week.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I have no doubt it will be more.\n&#xa0;\nQ101 &#xa0; \nPhilip Davies: I am reading your terms and conditions here.  Up to three days a week.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: Yes, they always underestimate, do they not?\n&#xa0;\nQ102 &#xa0; \nPhilip Davies: Two and a half days a week might seem to most people as close to up to three days a week.  You work two and a half days a week at £70,000 a year, on top of your £119,000 a year from the BBC, I might add.  Is there any real great justification for going from \ntwo and a half days a week to three days a week that you should, on top of your £119,000 from the BBC, now be paid £142,000 by \nOfcom\n for that extra half day a week?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: Apart from the high risk of appearing before Committees such as this, the remuneration is fixed by Ministers with reference to comparators.  It has been reduced by one-third since \nOfcom\n was originally set up, which seems to me perfectly proper in the current economic circumstances.  It is a decision for Ministers.\n&#xa0;\nQ103 &#xa0; \nPhilip Davies: One of the criticisms of \nOfcom\n is that they seem to have an awful lot of very highly paid staff.  Do you think that a three-day-a-week Chairman on £142,000 is the right person to be holding \nOfcom\n to account for having overly highly paid staff?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: \nOfcom\n regulates some very big global players with the capacity to have access to the best competition and legal advice in the world.  It does need to employ people who are themselves skilled and authoritative.  Of course, it does not pay private-sector rates of pay, but it cannot pay peanuts.  \nOfcom\n was very quick, after the economic problems, to freeze pay. It instituted the two-year pay freeze in 2010, ahead of quite a lot of the public sector.  The chief executive and the chairman took a voluntary 10% pay cut in addition to that.  The Remuneration Committee has been very careful, in the current climate, with remuneration, and you will find that the senior-salary-group salaries and the executive-group salaries are, in real terms, excluding the fact that post has had to come in, 19% lower than they were in 2010.  It is clearly extremely important in the current climate, and because it is public money, that \nOfcom\n takes it very seriously.\n&#xa0;\nQ104 &#xa0; \nPhilip Davies: Are you saying you would not do the job if you were paid any less than £142,000 a year?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I do not know whether I would have been moved to apply, but if you look at the non-execs, they clearly would command much higher remuneration on the boards they might be on elsewhere.  For example, Lord Blackwell has just been appointed chairman of Lloyds Bank.  It is extremely important that the non-executives on the \nOfcom\n board are people of some weight and authority, who those observing, and certainly those whom they regulate, believe are of weight and authority and, indeed, of that kind of weight and authority.  While, clearly, they should not be paid private-sector rates, I do think that there is a reasonable level at which the labourer is worthy of their hire.\n&#xa0;\nQ105 &#xa0; \nPhilip Davies: I understand that, but the bit I am intrigued by now is that you are not sure whether you would take the job or not.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: That was an aside.  Do not take that seriously.\nPhilip Davies: Most people who apply for jobs probably would not also have a £119,000 a year pension from the BBC, so I was just intrigued that you are not sure whether you would take the job for less.  It seems to me that you are struggling to get by on your £119,000 a year BBC pension, so you are having to weigh things up.  It is not so much you want the job but you need the £142,000 a year salary.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: One should never make flippant asides.  I apologise.\nChair: I could say, in terms of some of your answers, that much the same could be said for MPs.\n&#xa0;\nQ106 &#xa0; \nPaul Farrelly: Just one final question about the BBC and your time at the Trust.  This is not just through curiosity; it is because you are now on the cusp of being appointed chair of a very important body, with a very well-established chief executive itself.  Could you tell us why, in your opinion, that relationship between Michael Lyons and Mark Thompson broke down? What lessons you would draw from that?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I cannot tell you because I was not privy to the meetings between the two men.  My guess is that they had very different backgrounds and very different understandings of what the jobs were about.  I think it was partly a result of the structural pressures that we have described, but it was to do with the two men.  I think it was very specific.\n&#xa0;\nQ107 &#xa0; \nPaul Farrelly: The answer has not been very specific.  If you are going to draw lessons, you have to draw lessons from more specific observations.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I am not sure, apart from the general lesson of how important it is that the chair and chief executive have a proper, respectful relationship—an advise-and-warn relationship on the part of the chairman, and a no-surprises relationship on the part of the chief executive—\n&#xa0;\nQ108 &#xa0; \nPaul Farrelly: How did the breakdown in the relationship manifest itself?  Did you feel that the director general had erected a brick wall?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: Questions about the BBC, about my time on the Trust and about all sorts of things are very proper to this Committee’s concern about whether I am an appropriate candidate for this job, but we could all spend the rest of the day speculating about the BBC.  There are other things that I am sure Members want me to ask me about \nOfcom’s\n responsibilities that might be driven out if we get tempted to too much time on the BBC.\n&#xa0;\nQ109 &#xa0; \nPaul Farrelly: I am sure that you would have been in the same position, despite the diplomacy.  If I was on a board, I would not be speculating about why a relationship had broken down, because I would be witnessing it first-hand.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I am not going to talk about what happened in the boardroom.\n&#xa0;\nQ110 &#xa0; \nPaul Farrelly: What specific lessons have you drawn from that experience, then?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: That it is very important that a governance body, i.e. the board, of any organisation has total confidence in its chief executive—that goes without saying—and, as I said, that the relationship between the chairman and the chief executive is based on mutual respect and on a proper understanding of their respective roles.\n&#xa0;\nQ111 &#xa0; \nJim Sheridan: Public perception is everything in public life, as most of us sitting around this table know, but there is a public perception, I think, that people in your walk of life—nothing personal—are just shuffling the chairs around, awarding yourselves and defending \nyour salaries and pensions and all that kind of stuff.  The general public have some difficulty in understanding that.  It is an extremely difficult job that, hopefully, you will be taking on, but you will be paid more than the Prime Minister, or the equivalent.  What is so important in your job as opposed to the Prime Minister’s?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: All I can say is that the remuneration is fixed by Ministers.\n&#xa0;\nQ112 &#xa0; \nJim Sheridan: It is fixed by faceless people.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: I believe the Secretary of State will be before this Committee in two days’ time.\nChair: Tomorrow.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: Tomorrow.  You can ask her.\n&#xa0;\nQ113 &#xa0; \nJim Sheridan: You will be paid more than her.  I will ask her why she is worth less than you.  Finally, the obvious question: are you or have you ever been in any political activities or affiliations, or anything like that?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: When I was very young, I fought an election in Islington South and Finsbury, and managed to avoid losing my deposit.  As time went on, I married, I had a son, my BBC career began to develop and I had to make a choice, and I chose my BBC career.  That meant that I had to be completely impartial and have absolutely no political affiliations, activities or party contacts, and I have not done for 30 years.\n&#xa0;\nQ114 &#xa0; \nJim Sheridan: When you fought the seat, did you fight as an independent?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: No, I fought it as a Conservative.  There is a very good follow-up to that, which is: are you now or have you ever been a member of the Conservative Party, and the answer to that is no, because, in those halcyon days, it was possible to fight a seat without being a member of the party.  I thought that was quite a good thing.\n&#xa0;\nQ115 &#xa0; \nChair: I do not think you were the only one.  One final question: \nOfcom\n also has responsibility for adjudicating complaints about television content.  What sort of television do you watch?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: Dear, oh dear.  Drama.  \nDownton\n, I have to admit to—total junkie.  \nHomeland\n—there is social unrest in Highgate when they clash.  \nBroadchurch\n, Sherlock—\nI am a drama junkie and, as you might expect, a news junkie.\n&#xa0;\nQ116 &#xa0; \nChair: Channel 5?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: They have very good films on Channel 5, and they also have very useful news highlights at times that others do not.\n&#xa0;\nQ117 &#xa0; \nChair: Is there anything you have seen on television recently that you felt uncomfortable about and questioned whether or not it should have been on?\nSteve Rotheram: Save for the party conferences.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: There is quite a funny story about this, and what it tells you is how sensitivity to particular issues changes over time and how important it is not only to be very aware of complaints but to research changing perceptions.  \nI was watching, in the last week or two, a very old film on Film4 with Eddie Murphy, and there was a very strong language warning before the film.  The reason for this was not only of the words that we would now be very concerned about; it was the continued use of the “n” word.  It was deeply shocking.  Clearly, when this film was made, there was a point in it.  It was about perceptions and discrimination in the States, but clearly, when the film was made, it did not have those connotations, and it just reminded me.\nChair: What was the film?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: It was \nTrading Places\n.  \nChair: I thought it might be.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: It is a terrific film, but there were moments in it when you kind of went “What?  They would not put that on these days.”\nAngie Bray: That was only in the 1980s.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: Yes.  I have noticed throughout my career how very speedily things change.  For example, at the moment, because of \nsmartphones\n and \nsexting\n, or because of online/\nFacebook\n bullying, there is a terrific increase in public perception of, resistance to and concern about bullying of any kind, so it moves over time and it is very important to be responsive to these changes.\n&#xa0;\nQ118 &#xa0; \nSteve Rotheram: Is the watershed of any consequence in today’s culture?\nDame Patricia Hodgson: Yes, it is extremely important.  What is so interesting is that, even as some people, and especially people like me who get home late and so on, move our viewing—record it or access it on \niPlayer\n or whatever—the framework of familiarity as to what you might expect on what channel at what time of day remains extraordinarily strong.  The last piece of research that \nOfcom\n did on this was that people understand it and are comfortable with it.  It is counterintuitive, given people’s practices.  You could be watching a movie now, should you choose to do so.  Nevertheless, it is still an effective framework.\nSteve Rotheram: It is still relevant.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: Yes.\n&#xa0;\nChair: I think that is all the questions we have.  Can I thank you very much for appearing before us?  The Committee will aim to produce a publication within the next 24 hours, but we will let you know as soon as we have reached a conclusion.\nDame Patricia Hodgson: Thank you, Mr Chairman.\n              \nPre-Appointment Hearing for Government’s Preferred Candidate as Chairman of \nOfcom\n, \nHC \n933\n              \n              \n2\n"
