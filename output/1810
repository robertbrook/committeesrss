[normal] The Athena SWAN Charter evolved from work between the Athena Project and the Scientific Women’s Academic Network (SWAN), to advance the representation of women in science, engineering and technology (SET). In 2011, when the Chief Medical Officer announced that the National Institute for Health Research would only expect to shortlist medical schools for biomedical research centre and unit funding if the school holds a Silver Athena SWAN award.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Athena SWAN awards recognise and celebrate good practice in recruiting, retaining and promoting women in STEMM in higher education. The first step to gaining an award is to join the Charter. This makes higher education institutions (HEIs) eligible to apply for their own awards. HEIs must achieve a Bronze award before individual departments can apply for recognition in their own right, and potentially meet the criteria to gain a Silver Athena SWAN award. The Charter believes that a department must have institutional support and underpinning institutional good practice policies and processes in place in order to achieve and sustain an award.

[normal] Responsibility for childcare still falls disproportionately on women; it was notable that in the report Career Breaks for NHS and University doctors: An analysis of the WAM database, the men who had taken career breaks had not done so due to fulfilling caring responsibilities. It would be unlikely that the provision of improved, affordable childcare would affect the number of men in medical academia.
