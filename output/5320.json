"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written evidence from the Criminal Cases Review Commission&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Executive summary&#xa0;1\n              \nThe Criminal Case Review Commission is the statutory body created in 1997 to investigate alleged miscarriages of justice and refer appropriate cases \nto the appeal courts\n.\n&#xa0;\n2\n              \nIt has so far reviewed over 15,000 case\ns\n and referred more than 540 for appeal. The majority of those referrals \nwere in\n \nrelation to the most serious crimes.\n&#xa0;\n3\n              \nThanks to determined efforts to make ourselves accessible to \nall who might need us, \napplications to the Commission have\n risen by more than 50% sin\nce 2012. In spite of the increased workload, we have \nkept\n performance at or around 2012 levels. \n&#xa0;\n4\n              \nOur\n real terms\n funding shrank by almost 23% between 2008/9 and 2012/13. As a result there were redundancies and other cost saving measures. In 2013/14, in response to increased application rates, we received a small funding increase and recruited to cope with \nthe \nincreased workload.\n&#xa0;\n5\n              \nThe Commission \nlong\n argued \nthat \nits powers to obtain information should cover the private as well as \nthe \npublic sector\n, as in \nScotland\n. \nThe issue becomes more pressing as more functions transfer f\nrom\n the public to the private sector, but progress remains painfully slow.\n&#xa0;\n6\n              \nBetween April and November 2013\n, \nwe\n referred 24 case\ns. This looks set to return the\n referral rate to around 3.5% (the long term average) after two years when \nit\n dropped below 3%.\n&#xa0;\n7\n              \nWe have\n \nbeen concerned about a new series \nof cases involving \nthe wrongful conviction of people arriving\n in\n the \nUK\n as refugees and asylum seekers\n, or as victims of human trafficking\n. These have become\n a significant feature of our work.\n \n&#xa0;\n8\n              \nIn 2012 the Ministry of Justice \n(MoJ) \nconducted its first Triennial Review of the Commission and\n passed \nit \nwith flying colours.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Introduction&#xa0;9\n              \nThe \nCriminal Cases Review Commission \nis \nthe \nstatutory body \nresponsible for investigating\n alleged miscarriages of \njustice\n and \nrefer\nring appropriate\n \nconvictions\n \nand/or\n sentences\n to the appeal courts\n. \nIt was established on 1 \nJanuary\n 1997 by the Criminal Appeal \nAct\n 1995. \nIt was \nthe first\n body of its kind in the world.\n&#xa0;\n10\n              \nTo date\n, the Commission has reviewed more than 15,000 cases and has referred \n540\n \nfor appeal\n.\n&#xa0;\n The overwhelming majority of\n cases dealt with \nare of the most serious \ntype \n– murder, rape, terrorism\n, drugs\n and \nrobbery.\n&#xa0;\n11\n              \nGiven the scope of its role, the volume and range of its casework, and its concern with \nthe \nwhole process from investigation\n and \nprosecution\n to \nconviction and sentencing, the Commission is uniquely \nplaced to\n comment on all aspects of the criminal justice system and \ncan offer unparalleled \ninsight into \nthe \ncauses of \nwrongful convictions as well as into t\nhe ingredients which make for safe, successful convictions\n.\n&#xa0;\n12\n              \nT\nhe Commission c\nan assist others, not only \nin terms of \nthe\n prevention of unsafe convictions\n, but also in \nimproving the system’s ability to build successful c\nases and ensure safe convictions.\n&#xa0;\n13\n              \nIt is \nessential that the Commission is\n independent of \nthe \nexecutive and the judiciary because prosecutions are brought by the state, because a Commission \nreferral\n compels the appeal courts to hear the case and because it is sometimes the courts that are at fault.\n&#xa0;\n14\n              \nOnly if we are truly independent can we promote public confidence in the judicial system.\n \n&#xa0;\n15\n              \nIn addition to reviewing possible miscarriages of justice, the Commission can\n also\n be \nasked\n by the Court of Appeal \nCriminal Division \nto investigate and report on matters \nrelating to live proceedings\n.\n&#xa0;\n16\n              \nCommissioners and staff are drawn from a \ndiversity\n of \nbackgrounds including the legal profession\n, \nforensic \nscien\nces\n, \nlaw enforcement\n, journal\nism\n, acade\nmia\n and \nothers.\n&#xa0;\n17\n              \nAs of 2\n \nJanuary 2014, there are \neleven\n \nCommissioners appointed by the Queen on the recomm\nendation of the Prime Minister and \n94\n \nstaff (\n87.57\n \nfull \ntime equivalent) based at offices in \nBirmingham\n.\n&#xa0;\n18\n              \nThe \nCommission\n is \noperating\n with a \nfiscal \nDEL\n budget of \n£5,178,000\n funded through grant in aid from the \nMoJ\n.\nPerformance&#xa0;\n19\n              \nT\nhe Commission has taken innovative steps to \nmake itself accessible to all \n(see \nAccessibility\n \nbelow)\n. As a result, \nwe have\n \nseen \na substantial and sustained \ni\nncrease\n in application\ns\n.\n \nBetween 199\n7 and 2011\n t\nhe Commission \ntypically \nreceive\nd\n \naround 900 \napplications\n per year\n. In \nthe business year 2011/12 we received 1,040 applications\n; \nin\n 2012/13\n that rose to 1\n,\n625.\n \nWe expect \ncase intake to remain at \naround \nthis level\n.\n&#xa0;\n20\n              \nNotwithstanding the increase\nd caseload\n, in \nthe \nyear ending March \n2013, we \nkept\n \nthe \naverage \ntime taken to begin a review \nto just under six-and-a-\nhalf months for custody cases and nine months for liberty cases\n. In the current year to \nDecember\n, those figures are \nseven \nmonths for custody cases and \nnine-and-a-half\n months for liberty cases\n.\n&#xa0;\n21\n              \nWe measure the average time \ntaken to review two types\n of cases.\n \nFor \n \ncases which have not gone through the normal \nappeals\n process\n and\n therefore do not usually receive a full review\n it \ncurrently\n takes an average of 19 weeks to reach an\n initial decision. For \nthose\n other\n case\ns\n that\n \ndo \ngo on to receive a full review, it takes a\nn average\n of\n 21 weeks\n to reach initial decision stage\n. \n&#xa0;\n22\n              \nSee \nannex A\n for \naverage waiting times\n \nand \nannex B\n for \nduration of reviews.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAccessibility &#xa0;\n23\n              \nThe Commission \nbecame\n concerned about the accessibility of its services \nwhen research showed that \nparticular\n groups were under\n-\nrepresented in \nour case intake.\n \nThese\n groups include\nd\n \npe\no\nple with learning disabilities and/or \ndifficulties\n, \nyoung people, women in custody, asylum seeker\ns\n/refugees and victims of human trafficking. \n&#xa0;\n24\n              \nIn \nJanuary 2012 \nw\ne \ndesigned \nan \nEasy Read application form \nto assist \npeople with learning disabilities\n. The Easy Read format uses simple words and images to help people \nwho struggle with the written word\n; there is\n \nevidence that \nother groups, including\n young people and foreign nationals\n,\n \nprefer\n Easy R\nead form\ns \nto \nconventional one\ns\n. \n&#xa0;\n25\n              \nWe have extended the Easy Read principle to other\n Commission\n documents\n and \nhave worked throughout this process with \nthe \ncharity \nKeyring\n’s \nWorking for Justice Group\n. T\nhe MoJ has been \ns\nupportive \nof \nthese improvements\n. \n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Financial Backdrop&#xa0;\n26\n              \n              \nThe Commission has, like most govern\nment organisations, experienced\n budget reductions in recent years. In the five years \nto\n 2012/13, our\n \nnormal cash budget\n \n(\nfiscal \nDEL\n budget\n) has reduced by more than 13.5\n%.  Compensating for inflation, the reduction is almost 23%.  However, \nwe are pleased to report that \nour\n 2013/14 \nbudget\n \nincreased slightly\n. A\nfter taking out one-off costs incurred in 2012/13\n,\n and factoring in additional savings made, this\n allow\ned\n us to recruit \nstaff\n to\n help\n deal with\n rising business volumes\n.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n27\n              \n              \nThe budget reductions in the previous five years amou\nnted to £0.8m in money terms\n \n(\n£1.5m expres\nsed in \ntoday’s money\n)\n.  \nTo\n \ncope with these cuts \nwe \nimplemented e\nfficiencies and cost savings.  As staff costs account for \nmore than \n85% of our budget, significant savings had to come from reducing staff costs. A combination of a recruitment freeze and \nredundancies\n \nreduced our case\nworking staff over this period from 56.5 FTE\n to 46.9 FTE (a 17% reduction).\n Our current year\n budget\n has enabled us to increase our casework staff complement back to 53.9 FTE average for the year to date.  The use of additional short contract staff \nshould bring the\n total up to about 60 FTE for the whole year.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nLegislation&#xa0;\n28\n              \nThe Commission\n’s \npower\n under section 17 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1995 to secure material from public bodies\n \nis\n a key investigative tool.\n \nThere is\n no corresponding power in respect of private bodies or persons\n and\n the absence of such a power \ni\nnhibit\ns\n our work. A\nt best, the protracted negotiations to obtain \nprivate sector \nmaterial can delay a review by months, \nand at worst \nour inability to obtain information could\n mean a\nn\n \nissue\n remains unresolved and a miscarriage of justice \nperpetuated\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n29\n              \nThe problem is becoming more acute as \nresponsibility for material once held by public bodies is\n increasingly e\nntrusted to private sector bodies.\n              \n&#xa0;\n30\n              \nIn 2006 a\nn inter\n-\ndepartmental working party \nconcluded\n that\n \nthe \nCommission\n should have the ability, under judicial oversight, to require \nthe disclosure of material by private bodies and individuals\n as is the case with the Scottish CCRC\n. \n \nDisappointingly, \na\nlthough action has been supported \nin principle \nby Ministers\n, and \nin spite\n of the fact that there\n \nhave\n been some twenty pieces of criminal justice \nrelated legislation since then, no \nappropriate \nstatutory\n vehicle has apparently presented itself to remedy this \ndefect.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDirections for Investigation by the Court of Appeal&#xa0;\n31\n              \nThe Commission can be directed by the Court of Appeal to investigate and report on matters \nin relation to live appeal\ns\n (and applications for permission to appeal)\n. Since 1997 we have \nreceive\nd an\n average\n of\n \nfour\n such directions \na year\n (\neight\n per year since 2006/07).\n \nS\nuch\n cases can involve lengthy, complex investigations; because they\n relate to live proceedings \nthey\n necessarily take priority ove\nr cases \nawaiting review\n.\n&#xa0;\n32\n              \nThree \nof the cases that we have completed since our last Select Committee \nreport \nhave required very significant amount\ns\n of work. \n&#xa0;\n33\n              \nAllegations of \njury contamination or bias \nthrough the \ninapp\nropriate\n internet\n use has been\n a\n \nnotable\n \ntheme\n of recent \nenquiries\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nReferrals&#xa0;34\n              \nBetween April and\n \nNovember\n 2013, \nwe \nreceived \n949\n applications and referred\n 24\n cases \nto the\n appellate courts. In 2009/10 the rate of referrals as a percentage of all cases closed was 3.48% (31 referrals out of 892 cases). In 2010/11, that \nfell\n to 2.3% (22 out of 947 cases), but in 2011/12, it \nrose t\no 3.5% again (31 \nout of 887 cases).\n&#xa0;\n35\n              \nSee \nannex \nC\n for \nreferral \noutc\nome\ns\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNorthern Ireland&#xa0;\n36\n              \nThe Commission continues to receive a steady flow of cases from \nNorthern Ireland\n the \nmajority of\n which \nare Troubles\n related.\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\n37\n              \nThe Commission has so far \nreceived 367 \napplications\n from \nNorthern Ireland\n.\n \nOf\n \nthe \n316\n&#xa0;\ncases now closed,\n 39\n&#xa0;\ncases have\n been referred \nfor appeal. Of the \n34 cases \ndecided\n by the Nor\nthern Ireland Court of Appeal, \n30\n&#xa0;\nhave\n resulted in convictions being quashed or \nsentences reduced while c\nonvictions were upheld in \nfour\n cases.\n&#xa0;\nOne summary conviction was quashed by the County Court.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n38\n              \nOn 23 May 2012, the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal handed down the judgment in\n the cases of\n \nR v Brown, Wright, McDonald and McCaul\n [\n2012] NICA 14.\n&#xa0;\n These \ncases, \nreferred \nby us \nin\n 2009\n, \nconcern\ned\n admissions made by defendants who were 15 or 16 years old at the time of their arrest and interview in the 1970s. \n&#xa0;\nNone of the applicants had access to a solicitor during \nd\netention before making admissions and none was accompanied by a parent or independent person during interview. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n39\n              \nThe \nCo\nurt\n quashed the convictions of \nMessrs\n McDonald and McCaul but upheld those of \nMessrs\n Brown and Wright. \n&#xa0;\nFollowing the judgment, the Commission was able to progress \na number of\n other\n \n“\nyouth confession\n”\n cases which could not be reviewed until the outcome of \nthose cases was known\n.\n&#xa0;\n In all but \ntwo\n \nof those cases a decision \nwas\n made not to refer\n; the \ntwo\n \ncases remain under review.\n&#xa0;\n40\n              \nThe Commission is required by statute to have a Commissioner with particular knowledge of the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland and a new Northern Ireland Commissioner is about to be appointed. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;Casework themes&#xa0;\n41\n              \nWe have recently seen some new strains of miscarriage of justice arising alongside the disappointingly familiar ones such as those caused by the non-disclosure of material that could have been useful to the defence, investigative tunnel vision, failure to make adequate background checks on witness\nes and complainants \nand changes in the medical or scientific understanding of evidence. \n&#xa0;\n42\n              \nThe most significant new strain of cases has involved refugees or asylum seekers. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Cases involving immigration-type offences&#xa0;\n43\n              \nOver the last few years, \nwe have\n identified a series of cases where refugees or asylum seekers have been prosecuted for offences relating to their entry into the \nUK\n, such as having a false passport, having no passport or attempting to obtain services by deception.\n The Commission is concerned about \nthose \ncases \nwhere the\nre ha\ns\n been a failure to deploy available\n defences\n \nwhich are designed to prote\nct people escaping persecution.\n In a number of cases individuals have been prosecuted and advised to plead guilty when a statutory defence was available.\n&#xa0;\n44\n              \nWe have raise\nd\n awareness of the issues with charities and other\n organisations\n \nworking\n \nwith \npeople\n who may be wrongly convicted\n in this way\n. We have also\n raised\n awareness with the\n judiciary, the\n defence\n and the prosecution \nto \nseek to\n minimize the risk of\n further wrongful convictions\n. \n&#xa0;\n45\n              \nNevertheless, w\ne continue to receive applications from people convicted in these circumstances, some quite recently. \nBetween November 2011 and\n November 2013\n, we received \napproximately 80 applications \nof this type.\n S\nince our las\nt report to \nthis\n Committee, \nwe have referred \nf\nourteen \nsuch\n cases\n; \ntwelve \nconvictions have been \nquashed;\n \none\n person abandoned the\nir\n appeal \nand one case remains to be heard.\n \nThere is likely to be a significant further stock of such cases \nfrom people who are unaware that\n their conviction is unsafe. We are working with Crown Prosecution Service to identify these.\n&#xa0;\n46\n              \nAnother \nnew \ntype of case that concern us are \nthose involving\n victims of human trafficking \nwho may have been compelled to commit \nthe\n crime\n for which they are convicted and, thus, have a defence. Those convicted are often children or young adults. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCourts Martial cases&#xa0;47\n              \nIn 2009 the C\nommission’s \njurisdiction was extended to cover convictions and sentences arising from the Court Martial or \nService Civilian Court\n after 31 October 2009.\n As \nanticipated\n, \nthe impact of this \nhas been slight with \nonly \nthree\n applications \nreceived to date.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTriennial Review of the Commission&#xa0;\n48\n              \nDuring 2012/13 a triennial review of the Commission took place; the final report \nwas\n published \nin\n June 2013. We are delighted with the positive endorsement of our work and the support for our continued existence. \n&#xa0;\n49\n              \nThe report \nrecommended \nstrengthen\ning\n the role of Chair and\n changing \ngovernance structures.\n \nThere have been preliminary discus\nsions within the Commission and \nproposals on the role of the Chair are agreed.  As regards governance more generally, it was not considered\n \nappropriate to \nreach\n a settled view when the\n MoJ’s\n process to advertise the post of Chair and make an appointment was \nongoing\n.  The Chair was re-appointed \nin\n November 2013 and the matter will now be \ndiscussed\n at the next Commission Board meeting on 28 January.\n \n&#xa0;\n50\n              \nThe triennial review reinforces the need for the Commission’s independence and the requirement for a separation of powers between the executive and the judiciary. Whilst that is welcome, the Commission remains concerned about what may be perceived as an erosion of its independence \narising from pressures on \nit\n,\n and \non \nother Arms’ Length Bodies\n,\n to \nconform to centralised control\ns \napplied\n in way\ns\n that, in our view, fail to give due consideration to \nthe \nessential differences\n between central government and independen\nt\n public bodies\n.\n \nFor th\nose\n reasons, the Commission remains concerned about \nthe loss of \nits\n \nown \nwebsite. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Website and branding &#xa0;51\n              \nThe Commission was disappointed to have been required by the Government’s 2010 website \nrationalisation\n programme to close its own dedicated website\n. \nWe pursued every available avenue to oppose the loss of our site\n and made what we considered to be a strong business case based on the \npremise\n that having our own site was \nan\n important demonstration of our independence\n \nand a \nvital to\nol for\n \ne\nnsuring that\n \npotential \napplicants\n and other interested parties had reasonable access to us.\n&#xa0;\n52\n              \nSince \n2011 we\n have rel\nied, unhappily, \non the justice.gov.uk site.\n \nIt is with considerable trepidation that we \nface the prospect of the \nmove later this year to the .gov.uk site. We view that as a further step along a road to which we were, \nas explained\n above, fundamentally opposed.\n&#xa0;\n53\n              \nThe nub of this is that potential victims of miscarriages of justice\n often\n see themselves as victi\nms of the State as prosecutor. \nTo say that to seek redress they can go to a body\n supposedly\n independent of the executive, but one whose website has the word “State” over the doorway, is to risk the appearance of absurdity if not worse.\n \n&#xa0;\n54\n              \nThere have \nalso been\n moves to \nrationalise branding for public bodies including NDPBs such as the Commission. This proposal, under which the Commission would \nbe\n required to adopt the same logo and other branding elements as a \nrange\n of other public bodies, caused us considerable concern. Again, we argued that being required to adopt the coat of arms-based branding used by various bodies, including central government departments, would seriously compromise perception of our independence\n,\n undermine \nconfidence in \nus\n and \nconfuse\n actual and potential applicants\n. \n \nTowards the end of 2012 we received the welcome news that \nwe will\n be exempted from tho\nse proposals. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nStakeholder Activity&#xa0;55\n              \nOur aim has been to promote public understanding of our role and to raise informed awareness about the Commission with specific groups such \nas\n potential applicants, campaigners, the judiciary and the legal profession.\n&#xa0;\n56\n              \nThe main events of our stakeholder \na\nctivity over the last four years have been the successful stakeholder conferences held in 2010 and 2012. We attracted excellent speakers and panellists and a wide range of attendees to both events\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n57\n              \nWe have made specific efforts to engage with innocence projects and other university-based \npro bono\n projects interested in \nwrongful convictions \nand aiming \nto make\n applications to the Commission.\n&#xa0;\n58\n              \nWe\n have recently made available an advice \nline so that \npro bono\n units can benefit from advice provided by \ncasework s\ntaff. In 2012 we ran our first work experience placements for university students. The principal aim of our engagement with university projects is to encourage them to make timely and good quality applications in relation to appropriate cases.\n&#xa0;\n59\n              \nIn June 2013 we worked wit\nh \nWarwick\n \nUniversity\n to provide\n \nCommission \nspecific training for solicitors and barristers\n. We expect that this will \nhave\n increased understanding of the Commission and helped to improve the quality of applications to us. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAcademic research &#xa0;60\n              \nThe Commission has, \nwith appropriate safeguards in place, allowed controlled access to a number of \nacademic \nresearch projects exploring various aspects of \nour\n work. The research phase of two projects is complete and we expect to see publication of the results in 2014. Two further projects are still in the research phase and another has yet to begin. These projects are in addition to several published \nworks \nbased on access to Commission material.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIT&#xa0;\n61\n              \n              \nUntil 2012/13 the Commission’s IT service was outsourced to a\n private\n company, but the decision was made to bring the service in-house.  \nWe also conducted a\n review of our third party support contracts.  The resultant changes generated substantial savings.\n&#xa0;\n62\n              \n              \nThe Commission has invested \nin secure remote workin\ng facilities for some Commissioners and staff\n. \nThis has enabled more \nflexible working and \nhas\n, together with \nsome\n \n“hot-desking”,\n \nhelped\n \nto accommodate the recent\nly\n increase\nd\n staff numbers\n in the much smaller premises to which the Commission move\nd\n, for financial reasons, in May 2010.\n&#xa0;\n63\n              \nOther \ncurrent\n \nIT \nprojects \ninclude the crucial \nreplacement \nof \nour ageing and now \nunsupported case management system\n.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nConclusion&#xa0;64\n              \n              \nThe Commission \nhas proved its value in the criminal justice system over the last 16 years\n. While \nwe \nare grateful for the modest funding \nincrease in 2013/14, \nparticularly in light of the current economic climate, \nwe are acutely aware that \nmaintain\nin\ng \nat least the same \nlevel of fundi\nn\ng\n for\n \nnext year will be \ncr\nucial to \nour ability \nto\n \ndeal \nproperly \nwith\n the sustained increase in applications\n. Only an increase in funding would allow us to reduce queues to more reasonable levels. \n&#xa0;\n65\n              \n              \nWe believe that our casework function and its support services are as lean as they can be and our ability to investigate cases and reach the appropria\nte decision in each is as good now as it has ever been.\n \n&#xa0;\n66\n              \n              \nWe are proud of and committed to our efforts to ensure that we \nremain independent and\n accessible to all who need us. \n&#xa0;\n67\n              \n              \nWe aim to continue building relationships with individuals and organisations that will help us \nto \nfulfil our functions, to reach potential a\npplicants and\n raise informed awareness of our role\n,\n and\n \nhelp us feed\n \nback our findings \nto the criminal justice system at large.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;December 2013 \nAnnex A&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAnnex B&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAnnex C&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n#1642627v4\n              \nPage \n13\n of \n13\n              \n17-Jan-14\n \nCustody cases are applications to the Commission from people in custody. \nLiberty\n applications are applications from people who are at liberty.\n \nThe C\nommission\n is essentially a post-appeal organisation and applicants usually need to have appealed, or at least sought leave to appeal, before the Commission can review their case.
