[[[WOMEN IN SPORT: RIDERS of HORSES]]]I have been a voluntary access officer for the British Horse Society (BHS) for some 30 years. In that time I have been made aware that 95% of riders who use the rights of way network for riding horses are female.  Predominately from the lower socieo-economic backgrounds. Riding covers all social backgrounds and all age groups, from 3 years old to people in their nineties; from the fully fit to the disabled.The BHS has produced a very good study into the benefits of riding for the physical and emotional health of women. Many women want to access the countryside for physical exercise and for their emotional well being. Unlike men, many do not feel safe doing this on their feet alone. But when they are on a horse they feel safe to ride out alone unlike walking alone.Many of our equestrians both the Olympic teams and the para Olympic teams were female. But their sport starts with riding out on rights of way, and even at this top level they still use rights of way as their core exercise facilities. Unfortunately only 22% of the rights of way network are bridleways, compared with a 100% of the network for walkers. This means that in many areas of the country the only facilities for riders to use are the roads. Rights of way should be thought of as facilities, like elongated football pitches or swimming pools. They actually cost less public money per metre than these other public facilities.If we want girls to take exercise, and many girls ride and muck out their ponies etc, then every community in the whole country should have a network of byways and bridleways for these children to use. Bridleways are also available to cyclists so female cyclists would also gain. Unfortunately the government in all recent legislation to do with increased access to the countryside has improved things for walkers at the expense of equestrians.I feel strongly about this, since as a child the only exercise I took was riding, and I was backward academically. Having had success with a pony, I then started to apply it to my school work, where I was only expected to end up in a practical subject, but was motivated to get a degree. Now having had three cancers ten years ago, the medical profession could not understand my cheerfulness throughout the treatment. But I was again motivated by the work I was doing to extend the equestrian rights of way network for others.The UK government should follow the lead of Scotland and make all rights of way available to all non motorised users, so that all women and children would have somewhere safe to take exercise with their pony or cycle.Catriona Cook MBEBritish Horse Society (BHS), Yorkshire Regional Access Officer&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
