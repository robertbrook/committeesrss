"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the City of London Corporation&#xa0;Introduction&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe City of London Corporation’s Role in Supporting Green Finance &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhat are the main drivers behind institutional investors’ decisions on the type of investments they include in their portfolios?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow effective are the financial markets in matching available finance to the required investment in renewable energy and other green projects?  To what extent is a potential “carbon bubble” a real risk?&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhat should the Government be doing to help redirect finance to help fill the multi-billion pound green finance gap? How can ‘political risk’ to investors from changes to the Government’s energy and environmental policies be reduced? Can the Government ever remove political risk or are more innovative financial instruments that offset those risks the solution?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIs greater direction to banks needed to encourage them to increase their lending to renewable energy and green projects? &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow can pension funds and other investors be encouraged to re-direct their capital funds towards investments with green objectives? &#xa0;\n&#xa0;Are fiscal incentives for people/institutions to put funds in green investments needed, and if so what?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow can better information on the environmental impacts of investments and companies be provided to investors? What difference would such information make to investors in practice?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n What are the pros and cons of having a financial transaction tax (Tobin tax) with revenue hypothecated to support green investments? &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;What can the Government do to help increase the flow of finance to small and community-based renewable energy and green projects? &#xa0;&#xa0;\nWhat impact is the Green Investment Bank (GIB) likely to have on the green finance gap? Does it have the right investment strategy?&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1 October\n 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nA collection of research around this theme can be found \nat\n \nhttp://www.longfinance.net/tomorrow-s-cities.html\n \nhttp://www.zyen.com/Knowledge/Articles/index-linked_carbon_bonds_gilty_green_government.htm\n \nThis is increasingly used in the social sector – large charities  such as Scope\n and\n Golden Lane Housing have succes\nsfully raised funds in this way\n “\nDelivering Copenhagen\n: \nThe Role of the City’s Financial Services Sector\n \nin Supporting Action on Climate Change\n”, \npublished by the City of London Corporation, \n2009 \nOxera\n (2007), Stamp Duty: its impact and the benefits of its abolition, prepared for ABI, City of London, IMA and London Stock Exchange, May 2007\n London Economics (2013), The Impact of a Financial Transaction Tax on Corporate and Sovereign Debt, prepared for the International Regulatory Strategy Group, April 2013\n \nOxera\n (2012), \nWhat would be the economic impact of the proposed financial transaction tax on the EU?\n, prepared for AFME, ASSOSIM \nand Nordic Securities Association\n, January 2012\n \nOxera\n (2007), Stamp Duty: its impact and the benefits of its abolition, prepared for ABI, City of London, IMA and London Stock Exchange, May 2007\n“\nFinancing clean technology firms in the UK”,\n \nForum for the Future\n,\n \n \nhttp://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/services/environment-and-planning/sustainability/Documents/pdfs/SUS_WorkshopReportJuly06.pdf\n"
