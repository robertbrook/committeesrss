Written evidence [bold]from The College of Optometrists[bold] (LTC 19)[bold]Summary[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Three long term conditions are responsible for most cases of sight loss in the UK: age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]AMD[bold] [bold]is the biggest cause of sight loss in the UK.
[normal] 
[normal]A recent study estimated that 
[normal]2.4% of people in the UK 
[normal]aged 50
[normal] 
[normal]years or more had advanced wet AMD, increasing to 4.8% of those aged 65
[normal] 
[normal]years or more and 12.2% of those aged 80
[normal] 
[normal]years or more
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Smokers are three times more likely to suffer AMD
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The following table shows how the number of people with advanced AMD is predicted to rise
[normal] 
[normal]by a third
[normal] to 679,000 this decade
[normal] (the middle line shows prevalence amongst women and the bottom line prevalence amongst men):
[normal]1.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Diabetic retinopathy[bold] is the biggest cause of sight loss amongst pe
[normal]ople of working age in the UK.
[normal] 
[normal]It occurs when diabetes weakens the blood vessels in the eye.
[normal] 
[normal]People with diabetes are 25 times more likely than the general population to become blind
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Diabetes UK estimates that by 2025 there will be 5 million people in
[normal] England 
[normal]with diabetes
[normal] and for each year someone lives with diabetes, their risk of retinopathy increases.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Glaucoma[bold] is estimated to affect about half a million people in England.
[normal] 
[normal]The prevalence of glaucoma rises steeply with advancing age.
[normal] 
[normal]African-Caribbean people are at particular risk.
[normal] 
[normal]More than half of those glaucoma cases are thought to be undetected
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Government is committed to reducing preventable sight loss from these three long term conditions through an indicator in its 
[normal]Public health outcomes framework
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]We strongly support this.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Sight loss has a major impact on people’s well being.
[normal] 
[normal]Sight is the sense people most fear losing.
[normal] 
[normal]Over one-third of older people with sight loss are also living with depression
[normal]. Two-thirds of registered blind and partially sighted people of working age are not in paid employment
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]People with a long term eye condition often have other health problems
[normal] too
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Sight loss is associated with a heightened risk of falls and fractures
[normal] and people with a long term eye condition
[normal] often have 
[normal]other 
[normal]long term condition
[normal]s
[normal], such as dementia
[normal] and diabetes.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There is emerging evidence that eye care services are unable to meet current demand and will not meet rising demand in the future without significant improvements.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A recent survey found that half of all hospital eye units in England were unable to treat AMD patients within the recommended waiting times that would mini
[normal]mise their risk of sight loss
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Professor Sir Bruce Keogh
[normal]’s
[normal] 
[normal]evidence
[normal] 
[normal]to the Health Select Committee in January t
[normal]hat cataract 
[normal]surgery
[normal] was being rationed inappropriately by 
[normal]half of PCTs
[normal] 
[normal]highlighted
[normal] the strain hospital eye units are under as they str
[normal]uggle to meet existing demand, much of which is fuelled by long term conditions.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our recent report, 
[normal]Better data, better care 
[normal]showed how the NHS’ reliance on paper forms for payment and referrals hindered care and wasted valuable time and resources in the fight to prevent sight loss from long term eye conditions
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The failure to enable community and secondary care teams to share data is a major drag on the capacity of existing eye care services to meet demand now and in the future.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There are examples of 
[normal]innovation, which
[normal] if properly implement
[normal]ed
[normal] across the NHS, 
[normal]would
[normal] boost our capacity to meet the needs of people with long term eye conditions in the future.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Taking glaucoma care
[normal],
[normal] for example, 
[normal]NICE recommends that patients at risk of glaucoma be monitored in t
[normal]he community by optometrists th
[normal]rough ‘repeat measures’ schemes
[normal] rather
[normal] than
[normal] in hospitals
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]More advanced monitoring
[normal] 
[normal]in the community
[normal] (referral refinement)
[normal] is also recommended by the College of Optometrists and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Together, these schemes
[normal] im
[normal]prove 
[normal]glaucoma 
[normal]patients’ access to quality care by increas
[normal]ing
[normal] the capacity of eye services.
[normal] 
[normal]They 
[normal]keep less serious cases out of hospitals and take advantage of thousands of community optometrists already performing sight test
[normal]s
[normal] and 
[normal]caring for patients 
[normal]in
[normal] 
[normal]the NHS.
[normal] 
[normal]They can also save significant amounts of money; NHS Evidence found that moving repeat measurement for glaucoma in 
[normal]to 
[normal]the community 
[normal]in Bexley 
[normal]was 62% cheaper than the equivalent hospital tariff
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]To minimise sight loss from AMD, Gloucestershire has introduced a one stop shop model with integrated IT. Rather than assessing and treating patients over two visits, here assessment and treatment clinics run in parallel using non-consultant staff in particular nurse practitioners and optometrists. All clinical data is recorded electronically, allowing the consultant to make rapid treatment decisions for new and returning wet AMD patients using information on patient electronic medical records
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In most of England, we do not know the answer to simple questions like, how many patients are we
[normal] treating for glaucoma or if at risk groups 
[normal]get their eyes examined.
[normal] 
[normal]Scotland has been particularly innovative 
[normal]in
[normal] overcoming IT barriers 
[normal]by
[normal] integrat
[normal]ing the electronic systems of
[normal] community optometrists and hospitals eye unit 
[normal]to
[normal] 
[normal]improve access to 
[normal]better 
[normal]quality care and improve efficiency at the same time.
[normal] 
[normal]Following a successful pilot, the Scottish Government is committed to ensuring that 95% of referrals from community optometrists to hospitals are done elect
[normal]ronically rather than in paper.
[normal] 
[normal]Paper referrals are the 
[normal]norm in most of England.
[normal] 
[normal]Moving to e
[normal]lectronic referral means community and hospital clinicians can share much more information about their patients over time with the aim 
[normal]of
[normal] improv
[normal]ing
[normal] the continuity of care, reduc
[normal]ing
[normal] unnecessary referrals to the hospitals, improv
[normal]ing
[normal] efficiency and improv
[normal]ing
[normal] patient outcomes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Scotland is also working towards 
[normal]making 
[normal]provider payment forms electronic
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Electronic payment facilitates much better data collection about who is accessing eye care and how to design services that improve the care of populations with long term eye conditions.
[normal] 
[normal]However, in England, most optometrists 
[normal]must submit their payment forms, 
[normal]which include potentially valuable public health data, in paper form making it extremely difficult to analyse
[normal] the data 
[normal]to
[normal] improve eye health services
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]If accomplished, the Governments push for a paperless NHS offers great potential to improve eye care for people with long term conditions.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The move to involve clinicians more closely in commissioning also offers potential to improve care.
[normal] 
[normal]NHS England is introducing Local Eye Health Networks in to each local team area
[normal] to bring together commissioners, community and hospital clinicians and patient groups to work together to assess local need and improve the quality and efficiency of eye health services for their local population.
[normal] 
[normal]We strongly recommend that commissioners take advantage of these networks and are supporting our members so they can contribute fully.
