[normal]1. 
[normal]              
[normal]Introduction.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1  
[normal]              
[normal]As 
[normal]in 
[normal]many cities 
[normal]Greater Manchester has some of the busiest roads in the country
[normal]. The city
[normal] is a major hub for commercial activity and 
[normal]has 
[normal]been affected by 
[normal]the national increase in road user traffic. Whilst it has an increase in 
[normal]its fair share of heavy goods veh
[normal]ic
[normal]les and buses using these roads
[normal] it does not contain the 
[normal]amount of continuous 
[normal]structural 
[normal]development that the capital is experiencing.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]              
[normal]It is clear that Manchester does not have the motoring infrastructure which requires the constant monitoring from 
[normal]T
[normal]fL
[normal] to allow free flow of traffic and use of road users within the capital.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.
[normal]3
[normal]  
[normal]              
[normal]It has become apparent that cycling as a mode of transport is on the increase as more road users 
[normal]are
[normal] switching 
[normal]to pedal cycle
[normal]s. This has been enhanced with the success of the British Cycling 
[normal]T
[normal]eam and 
[normal]as a more cost effective, sometimes quicker and greener way to comm
[normal]ute to work and places of 
[normal]study
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4
[normal]              
[normal]Greater Manchester is the home of British Cycling and has excellent faciliti
[normal]es within the 
[normal]Velodrome
[normal]. The 
[normal]road
[normal]s are not, proportionately, as well developed
[normal].  
[normal]              
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]              
[normal]N
[normal]ational 
[normal]KSI 
[normal]statistics 
[normal]identify 
[normal]that whilst
[normal] overall
[normal] numbers 
[normal]of KSI’s have decreased
[normal] the 
[normal]proportion of 
[normal]pedal cyclists KSI numbers
[normal] has 
[normal]risen
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4
[normal]              
[normal]Within Greater 
[normal]Manchester t
[normal]he highest number of KSI figures in relation to pedal 
[normal]cyclists
[normal] was the main 
[normal]A34, B5117 and A6010
[normal] route from 
[normal]the south west of Manchester
[normal] to the city centre. This route 
[normal]is 
[normal]used by students using pedal power attending the University of 
[normal]              
[normal]Manchester and 
[normal]daily commuters. This route 
[normal]includes what is commonly known as ‘Curry Mile’ as the road is the centre of a plethora of late night eating houses 
[normal]used by all.
[normal]  F
[normal]rom January 2011 to August 2012 there were 43 
[normal]pedal 
[normal]cyclists’
[normal] collisions
[normal] 
[normal]on this r
[normal]oad 
[normal]4 of which were serious
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]I
[normal]n order to reduce the number of collisions on the roads within Greater Manchester 
[normal]officers above
[normal] from Traffic Network Section developed an innovative approach named Operation 
[normal]‘
[normal]Grimaldi
[normal]’
[normal] which underpins 
[normal]the force
[normal] road saf
[normal]ety initiative Operation 
[normal]‘
[normal]Dice

[normal]              
[normal]Phases
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal] 
[normal]1
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]The
[normal] first phase 
[normal]involves an educational interactive 
[normal]‘
[normal]walkthrough
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal]exhibition containing an articulated tractor unit 
[normal]with
[normal] full sized curtain sided trailer and a bus.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]              
[normal]The

[normal]Walkthrough
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3
[normal].1  
[normal]              
[normal]Initially 
[normal]Operation ‘
[normal]Grimaldi
[normal]’ staff 
[normal] arrange a suitable place to
[normal] hold an interactive walk through in specifically targeted areas
[normal] such as town 
[normal]centre’s
[normal] or outside 
[normal]the 
[normal]University buildings. This involves 
[normal]vehicles from a 
[normal]local haulage 
[normal]company ‘
[normal]Fagan and 
[normal]Whalley
[normal]’ 
[normal]and 
[normal]‘Stagecoach’ 
[normal]bus
[normal] company
[normal],
[normal] who also provide
[normal] their respective 
[normal]senior 
[normal]driving trainers
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3
[normal].2  
[normal]              
[normal]The HGV 
[normal]unit and 
[normal]articulated 
[normal]trailer 
[normal]is set at a slight angle as though 
[normal]the driver / vehicle was 
[normal]turning
[normal] left (the most common 
[normal]manoeuvre
[normal] 
[normal]involved in
[normal] KSI’s)
[normal] to highlight the blind 
[normal]spots
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]A member of the public then
[normal] sits in the driver’s seat 
[normal]where 
[normal]t
[normal]he trainer 
[normal]p
[normal]oint
[normal]s
[normal] out the 
[normal]blind spots 
[normal]and
[normal] difficulties that 
[normal]a 
[normal]HGV driver ha
[normal]s
[normal] especially when turning left
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3
[normal].3
[normal]              
[normal]This also 
[normal]dispels 
[normal]the 
[normal]assumption 
[normal]that they can see the drivers mirror so 
[normal]the driver
[normal] must be able to see them. 
[normal]Th
[normal]e input 
[normal]also includes what mirrors on the vehicle can ass
[normal]ist and that not all such vehicles have proximity mirrors.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3
[normal].4
[normal]              
[normal]The bus 
[normal]company also provides a senior 
[normal]trainer
[normal] who will also
[normal] invite people to sit in the driving seat
[normal]. The instructor then 
[normal]walk
[normal]s
[normal] into the blind 
[normal]spots
[normal] and ask
[normal]s
[normal] if he can be seen
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Whilst the member of the public 
[normal]sitting in the driving seat will often shift position by leaning back or forward in an attempt to see the 
[normal]instructor the 
[normal]fact that this is not practical whilst driving is pointed out by the trainer.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].1
[normal]  
[normal]              
[normal]Highlighted 
[normal]locations
[normal] are carefully chosen and 
[normal]a full risk assessment is undertaken.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].2 
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]One 
[normal]junction 
[normal]in particular 
[normal]was highlighted in the data as the centre of 
[normal]collision
[normal]              
[normal]hotspot
[normal]s
[normal] for pedal cyclists
[normal]. Observations at this junction by ‘
[normal]Grimaldi
[normal]’ staff revealed 
[normal]              
[normal]that there 
[normal]were
[normal] a
[normal]lso a
[normal] large number of near misses
[normal] at this 
[normal]location
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].3  
[normal]              
[normal]The
[normal] 
[normal]main 
[normal]offences 
[normal]committed are
[normal] careless and inconsiderate cycling,
[normal] failing to comply 
[normal]with traffic signs
[normal], 
[normal]cycling
[normal] with
[normal] no lights fitted or illuminated and cycling on 
[normal]the footpath
[normal].
[normal] A 
[normal]significant
[normal] number of collision
[normal]s
[normal] take place when a cyclist rides from the pavement into the road.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].4  
[normal]              
[normal]Failing to comply with traffic signs can be red lights or one way streets. Cycling with
[normal] no lights fitted or illuminated is an offence, which can only
[normal] be dealt with during the hours 
[normal]of darkness. Cycling on the footpath is dealt with on a common sense approach
[normal] 
[normal]i.e.
[normal]: busy footpaths in town centres. The previous three can be dealt with by way of a traffic 
[normal]o
[normal]ffence report 
[normal]whilst
[normal] careless and inconsiderate cycling is a 
[normal]summonsable
[normal] offence and deemed more serious.
[normal] The only offence a PCSO can enforce is cycling on the foot
[normal]path all others have to be dealt with by a constable. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].5  
[normal]              
[normal]Having chosen a suitable location 
[normal]the team of officers / staff working together to deliver the operation
[normal] observe
[normal] 
[normal]offenders, be it
[normal] 
[normal]cyclists or 
[normal]              
[normal]other road users, the details are forwarded to ‘sto
[normal]ppers’ who directs offenders to a safe location to stop.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.6
[normal]              
[normal]The offenders are 
[normal]spoken to by an officer. 
[normal]Vehicular offences are processed in the usual manner whilst 
[normal]the offending cyclist is issued
[normal] with 
[normal]a traffic offence report
[normal] 
[normal](
[normal]£
[normal]50
[normal] fine). 
[normal]              
[normal]As an alternati
[normal]ve to the fine t
[normal]he cyclists are then given the opportunity to 
[normal]attend 
[normal]a
[normal] force
[normal] cycle safety 
[normal]presentation
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]informed 
[normal]upon conclusion of such 
[normal]the fine will be rescinded.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.7
[normal]  
[normal]              
[normal]This 
[normal]mirrors the current driver improvement scheme and is a onetime offer
[normal] and at this stage is free
[normal].  Cyclists are informed that if they commit a further offence this will result in a fine or court appearance. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].
[normal]8
[normal]  
[normal]              
[normal]It is clear that if the ticket is
[normal] not issued 
[normal]cyclists would not attend the
[normal] safety 
[normal]              
[normal]presentation
[normal].

[normal]The presentations are held in 
[normal]the 
[normal]local 
[normal]proximity to where
[normal] the enfor
[normal]cement has happened, usually at 
[normal]community rooms in local Fire Stations.
[normal] 
[normal]This is 
[normal]led by

[normal]7.1
[normal]              
[normal]The force 
[normal]has
[normal] produced a leaflet 
[normal]based on ‘S
[normal]haring the 
[normal]R
[normal]oad
[normal]’
[normal] in which it includes education for all road users. It is felt that this can be used at any event within the force and aimed at any members 
[normal]of the public.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2
[normal]              
[normal]The force are also involved in the training of 
[normal]the drivers of HGV and bus companies on the correct setting of mirrors and the hazard perception of other road users including cyclists when using the road systems.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.3
[normal]              
[normal]The force have obtained the use of a Volvo D40 
[normal]motor vehicle, s
[normal]upported and lent 
[normal]by Volvo, 
[normal]fitted with a unique cyclist and pedestrian safety system which includes auto braking, blind spot information system and 360
[normal]o

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8
[normal]              
[normal]Recommendations
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.1
[normal]              
[normal]Most of the offences committed by cyclists are seen as low level and as such are not dealt with robustly. Consideration must be given to ex
[normal]panding the powers of the PCSO 
[normal]to include such offences as lighting and fail to conform to
[normal] traffic signs. Currently they 
[normal]can only issue 
[normal]a Traffic Offence Report
[normal] 
[normal]for the offence of cycling on the footpath.  This would fit th
[normal]e new 
[normal]recommendations of increasi
[normal]ng the use of neighbourhood policing
[normal] model and allow more cyclists to be educated
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.2
[normal]              
[normal]Cycle retailers could do more to support the work of the local authorities, police and community groups by ensuring 
[normal]when 
[normal]they sell a cycle 
[normal]it is 
[normal]fitted with the 
[normal]respective lighting
[normal], security
[normal], (lock and cycle marking
[normal]) fluorescent
[normal] jacket
[normal] and 
[normal]advice on the rules of the road for cyclists
[normal], cycle maintenance 
[normal]together with
[normal] free cycling information
[normal] in with the purchase price.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.3
[normal]              
[normal]An N
[normal]DORS style
[normal] course similar to the dri
[normal]ver improvement scheme
[normal] should be developed
[normal]. (GMP 
[normal]is
[normal] 
[normal]currently compiling such for 
[normal]TfGM
[normal] to complete and offer of training for offences committed within the
[normal] 
[normal]force). This leaves the force to deal with enforcement and the local authority to train.
[normal] 
[normal]The aim eventually would be to look to a national course. 
[normal] This would also follow with
[normal] 
[normal]a training of police staff as to the new system in place.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.4
[normal]              
[normal]Whilst there are many areas within Greater Manchester that are relatively safe to cycle 
[normal]              
[normal]there are a numbe
[normal]r of areas of concern
[normal]. The area highlighted is one that has been given 
[normal]              
[normal]government approval to change the road structure reducing the potential risk to 
[normal]              
[normal]cyclists.
[normal] 
[normal]However the traffic displaced may well 
[normal]create
[normal] another potential ‘hot spot.’
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.5
[normal]              
[normal]Despite the
[normal] number of HGV’s on the road system to prohibit such at peak times would 
[normal]              
[normal]not be feasible for the following reasons.
