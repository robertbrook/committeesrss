A local authority’s decision whether to retain its sheltered stock or transfer it to a provider registered with the HCA is the single most important factor determining the pattern of provision but is not \nthe only one.\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe relative proportions of working age supported housing and of sheltered housing for old\ner people in authorities depend\n on the level of provision for what were in the Supporting People programme called the “socially excluded” groups. Broadly speaking, provision for these groups has tended historically to be concentrated in major population centres.\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is not a neat divi\nsion between people of working age and people of pension age. \nThe proportion of people of working age living in sheltered housing for older people is higher than the proportion of people above pension age living in supported housing for people of working a\nge, as are the actual numbers\n, but there is a signficiant mix in many projects in all areas\n.\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe cost of ordinary sheltered housing for older people is generally lower than the average costs of supported housing for other types of provision (including Extr\na Care sheltered housing)\n. This apart, there is no other consistent pattern of varying costs across client groups either in the degree of variation or the client groups that are most expensive.\ne)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe current level of understanding of either providers or loca\nl authorities is such that we cannot be confident accommodation is being accurately categorised \nby Housing Benefit departments \nas exempt or otherwise.\n \nFor the time being Single Housing Benefit Extract data cannot be relied on even as a measure of the volum\ne of supported exempt accommodation and the Housing Benefit expenditure upon it.\nf)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe amount of Housing Benefit claimed by people of working age in supported and sheltered housing in any local authority depends less on the proportion of supported and shelte\nred housing that currently counts as exempt accommodation than on the extent to which that local authority has provision for what in the Supporting People programme were known as the “socially excluded” groups.\nFuture responsibility for the cost of supported and sheltered housing. \n27 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
