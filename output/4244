defaultStephen Hockmandefault QC gave evidence
defaultQ68 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Stephen, we are going to crack on because colleagues are very keen to hear the Chancellor’s autumn statement, so we are going to get moving.
default 
defaultWould you like to say anything to start off
default 
defaultor jump straight into questions? 
defaultStephen Hockmandefault: Could I make two very brief observations?
default 
defaultFirst
default,
default I would like to say that I am very strongly supportive of the inquiry that you are undertaking 
defaulton 
defaultthe possibility of constitutional codification, not least because
default,
default whether the conclusion is that that is a good thing or a bad thing, the process of discussing the nature and content of our constitution, the process of considering whether it would be beneficial to move closer to codification, is undoubtedly in the public interest.
default 
defaultI think that helps to enable everyone—the man in the street and particular groups of individuals—to understand the concepts much better and that has to be a good thing. 
defaultSecondly, equally briefly, I am particularly supportive, if I may say so, of the idea of concentrating on the role of the judiciary within that overall context.
default 
defaultIt is clear from the evidence that you have already received, which I have looked at, that what that is going to enable you to do is to consider what the status of a codified constitution would be and what its nature would be, how it would fit within our overall system of governance.
default 
defaultThat
default,
default I think
default,
default too
default,
default is very beneficial.
default 
defaultUntil you understand what the status of a codified constitution would be and what it would amount to, it is very difficult to come to a conclusion 
defaultabout 
defaultwhether it is a good idea.
default 
defaultAll in all, as I say, I am very supportive and I feel privileged to be here. 
default&#xa0;
defaultChair:default Thank you, Stephen
default.
default 
defaultIt is 
defaultvery good that you are here
default,
default and thank you for your long-term commitment to working in this field.
default 
defaultIt is very instructive.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ69 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Turner:default Could you start by giving us a brief overview of the current constitutional role of the judiciary? 
default&#xa0;
defaultStephen Hockmandefault: Yes.
default 
defaultI suppose the traditional analysis is that there are three key elements in the constitution: 
defaultParliament—
defaultthe legislature
default—
defaultthe Executive
default,
default and the judiciary, and that they all have different functions.
default 
defaultThose functions are well known.
default 
defaultI think that traditional analysis still holds good.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ70 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Turner:default Would you mind setting them out, for my benefit and 
defaultthat of 
defaultothers? 
default&#xa0;
defaultStephen Hockmandefault: Of course.
default 
defaultParliament makes the law, the judiciary interpret and apply the law to particular factual positions and the Executive administer and enforce the law.
default 
defaultThat is the way that I would express it
default,
default in very simple terms.
defaultI think there is one interesting 
defaultmodern 
defaultqualification to that.
default 
defaultThis is something that is still in the course of development.
default 
defaultWhat I think has become increasingly recognised is that inevitably judicial decisions, interpreting and applying the law to particular factual situations, involve statements of principle
default. 
defaultAt least
default, the
default higher up the judicial hierarchy you go, the more likely it is that you will get a statement of principle.
default 
defaultThat is inevitable and surely appropriate.
default 
defaultYou don’t want judges simply to say, “This is the law that Parliament has made.
default 
defaultApplying it to the facts
default,
default 
defaultI think the 
defaultanswer is X or Y”.
default 
defaultYou want judges to explain their reasons and you want them to articulate the principles that they think are relevant to the case in explaining how they
default 
defaultare applying the law to the facts.
default&#xa0;
defaultOnce those principles have been articulated by the judges, they become, in themselves, part of our law.
default 
defaultThey are the principles of case law which are then
default 
defaultapplied in later cases.
default 
defaultThat is how our common law has developed.
default 
defaultI think there is an increasing understanding of the importance of those principles, as established particularly by the higher courts, as forming part of the corpus of law that applies in our country.
default 
defaultThe same is true of any other common law system where judicial decisions have the same importance as they have here.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ71 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Turner:default Is it that there must be some principles o
defaultr
default 
defaultthat 
defaultthere should be some principles
default behind what
default 
defaultlawyers
default are finding? 
default&#xa0;
defaultStephen Hockmandefault: I think it is inevitable that the judges will set out the principles upon which they make their decisions.
default 
defaultThey could not do their job without doing that.
default 
defaultSpeaking personally, I also think that is a good idea because one of the advantages of judicial decision-making
default,
default fr
defaulto
defaultm a 
defaultpublic interest 
defaultpoint of view
default,
default is that judges do give reasons for their decisions.
default 
defaultYou can see their principles set out in their decisions
default, you can see how
default the judges arrive at those principles, you can critique them and it is entirely transparent. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ72 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Turner:default In the paper you co-authored with Professor Bogdanor, you stated
default,
default “It has become apparent that we have, in a piecemeal and unplanned way, been codifying our constitution”.
default 
defaultHow do you think these piecemeal changes 
defaulth
defaultave affected the judiciary? 
defaultStephen Hockmandefault: A very good example is the way in which our constitution changed between 2003 and 2005.
default 
defaultThat particular change was one 
defaultthat
default directly affected the judiciary and, for example, led to the headship of the judiciary passing from the Lord Chancellor to the Lord Chief Justice.
default 
defaultIt seems to me indisputable that that is an example of our constitution changing in a rather 
defaultpiecemeal and informal way
default,
default and in a way 
defaultthat
default many people regarded as not 
defaultentirely
default satisfactory.
default 
defaultThe outcome may have been very satisfactory.
defaultThe key features of the changes that took place there
default,
default including the subdivision of the 
defaultrole of the 
defaultLord Chancellor, the setting up of a Supreme Court independent of Parliament, the recognition of the status of the Lord Chief Justice as head of the judiciary, are all substantive changes to the constitution that I suspect most people would applaud, but the process by which it happened has been the subject of a fair bit of criticism.
default 
defaultOne of the 
defaultbenefits 
defaultof a codified constitution is that change in the future would be much more transparent.
default 
defaultA codified constitution obviously would not be unchangeable, it would be capable of being amended, but the proce
defaultss
default of amendment would be a little more formal than it has 
defaultbeen 
defaultin the past, and therefore more democratic.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ73 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Turner:default I don’t understand why they are democratic and how they have actually changed.
default 
defaultI know they had changed but I don’t understand why it was so important that the Lord Chancellor handed over to the senior judge. 
default&#xa0;
defaultStephen Hockmandefault: Unless you would particularly like me to, I will not dwell on the detail of those changes, but it seems to me that if you disapprove not only of the process by which that happened but of the substantive outcome, there is an even stronger argument in favour of codification.
default 
defaultThe whole problem about that process was that it took place in a slightly less than transparent way.
default 
defaultBy the time Parliament came to approve this in the form of the Constitutional Reform Act, everything was pretty well signed, sealed and delivered.
default 
defaultThere was not the possibility, I suspect, of any real debate at the outset.
default 
defaultThere was no Green Paper or White Paper; there was no formal process.
default 
defaultIt seems to me that someone—I am not one of those; on the contrary, I feel that the outcome was appropriate—who disapproved o
defaultf
default the outcome
default 
defaultwould be all the more strongly in favour of a slightly more formal and transparent process for achieving constitutional change, and that is what codification would provide.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ74 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I don’t know whether you caught Lord Judge’s remarks yesterday
default, which were
default reported today.
default 
defaultThe
defaulty
default follow on from Lord Laws, Lord Sumption and Lady Hale, all of whom have raised this issue of European judicial activism
default,
default and all seem to infer that if there is clarity about what we can do in terms of the British judiciary, that clarity would help put lines in the sand about how far interpretation on thin
defaultg
defaults like the European Convention o
defaultf
default Human Rights could 
defaultg
defaulto.
default 
defaultForgive me if you have not followed that, and I will not p
defaultu
defaultrsue it, but if you have followed that debate, what is your view on that?
default 
defaultWould it be helpful to define British rights within a European context by having them written down and codified? 
default&#xa0;
defaultStephen Hockmandefault: Unfortunately I was not able to go and listen to Lord Judge’s speech last night and I have not seen a transcript of it yet.
default 
defaultI have read reports about it in the newspapers.
default 
defaultI have read the recent speech by Lord Sumption and the recent lecture by Lord Justice Laws.
defaultSince
default 
defaultyou are inviting me to give my own views, perhaps I might do it in 
defaultthis 
defaultway
default: 
defaultI would like to divide this into two parts.
default 
defaultPart 1 is international and part 2 is domestic.
default 
defaultI think it is important to start with the international aspect, and I am not sure how far this was covered in some of the speeches that I have mentioned.
default 
defaultAs I see it, the European Convention on Human Rights is an international treaty.
default 
defaultWe have signed up to that; we are parties to it.
default 
defaultFrom this perspective it is like any other international treaty, and it contains some provisions, including a provision that says that decisions by the 
defaultStrasb
defaulto
defaulturg Court
default are binding in the particular case that the court has been considering.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn theory
default,
default we could decide at some point in time to leave the Convention and to cease to be bound by that treaty, but as long as we are bound by the treaty
default,
default I think it is extremely important that we uphold its provisions and conform to decisions of the court in particular cases.
default 
defaultThat is because
default,
default if we decide to ignore the provisions of treaties by which we are bound, we can expect other countries to do the same.
default 
defaultIt would set, in my view, an appalling precedent if other countries refused to extradite people to this country even though there is an extradition treaty, or if trade arrangements were routinely ignored.
default 
defaultWe simply have to comply with our international obligations.
default 
defaultI think that is a point worth making.
default&#xa0;
defaultLet me move to the second part.
default 
defaultI realise Mr Turner wants to question me on the first part but let me just make my second point.
default 
defaultDomestically
default,
default the situation is different.
default W
defaulte have incorporated the Convention into domestic law
default,
default using the mechanism of the Human Rights Act.
default 
defaultThe Human Rights Act provides that our courts have to take into account the decisions of the 
defaultStrasb
defaulto
defaulturg Court
default in deciding other cases, but they do not have to regard themselves as bound.
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Bingham
default—
defaultwho as you know presided over the judiciary committee of the House of Lords for the first 10 years or so of the existence of the Human Rights Act and who is widely regarded as having made an extraordinary contribution as one of our senior judges—expressed the view in more than one case, with the support of the other 
defaultL
defaultaw
default L
defaultords, that generally speaking we should follow decisions of the Strasb
defaulto
defaulturg Court.
default 
defaultHe did not consider it right for the higher courts in this country to take a significantly independent line.
default M
defaultore recently, as, Chairman, you have pointed out, other 
defaultjudges
default have taken the view that we 
defaultshould 
defaulttake a more independent line, frankly reflecting public and political opinion in so saying.
default 
defaultThere is nothing in the Human Rights Act that prevents 
defaultjudges 
defaultfrom doing that, because the Act simply says you must take into account 
defaultStrasb
defaulto
defaulturg
default decisions.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt seems to me that what we are witnessing is an evolution in judiciary thinking.
default 
defaultWe are witnessing the principles, which I mentioned in an earlier answer, evolving and being adjusted to take into account prevailing soci
defaulto
default-political circumstances, and that is one of the strength
defaults
default of the common law.
default 
defaultI see no problem with that, but what is important for prese
defaultn
defaultt purposes, in answer, Chairman, to your question, is that none of this, to my mind, undermines the notion that 
defaultwe 
defaultshould continue to be bound by the Convention as a matter of treaty obligation.
default 
defaultNone of it undermines the concept of enforcing the Convention in this country through the Human Rights Act.
default 
defaultWhat it means is that we may choose to apply the Convention in this country in a way 
defaultthat
default is different from the way in which the 
defaultStrasb
defaulto
defaulturg Court
default has recommended.
default 
defaultThat is permissible under the Act and looks as if it is likely to happen more and more.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ75 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Lord Judge apparently said last night—and again I am going by reports
default,
default not the transcript—that the British courts had supremacy over 
defaultStrasb
defaulto
defaulturg
default and should retain that supremacy.
default 
defaultI think there are many people in the 
defaultUK
default who
default—
defaultin the con
defaulttext 
defaultof
default the acceptance of
default human rights standards of course
default—
defaultwould be reassured if that was not a debating point but was written down so that everyone could feel at ease with our own judiciary and not a sense of unease 
defaultat 
defaultjudicial activism.
default 
defaultThis is a matter of there will never be certainty
default,
default but there can be a degree of clarification, which is where I am leading you, in a sense.
default 
defaultClarification is helpful to all of us in these circumstances. 
default&#xa0;
defaultStephen Hockmandefault: I accept that.
default 
defaultPutting the point that you have made to me in slightly different words
default,
default and in the context of constitutional codification, what you might seek to achieve in codifying
default 
defaultthe constitution in this area—not in changing it
default,
default but in codifying it and in clarifying it—would be to incorporate the Human Rights Act into 
defaultit 
defaultbut
default,
default to put what I have just been saying in even clearer terms
default,
default to make it absolutely explicit that
default,
default in the general run of cases
default,
default the decision
defaults were
default for our courts to make, that the application of the Convention was for our courts.
default 
defaultIf, for instance, although I personally would not agree with this, our courts took the view that it was 
defaultconsistent with
default the 
defaultConvention to deny prisoners votes, then our courts would be entitled to say that.
default 
defaultIf in the end our courts thought that the Convention permitted that, they would be entitled to make that ruling.
defaultIf a codified constitution were to make that explicit, I agree with you that that would be an
default 
defaultadditional benefit of codification.
default 
defaultThe only qualification to all of that is that
default,
default as long as we are parties to the Convention, as long as we are bound as a matter of international law by the Convention
default, then i
defaultn an individual 
defaultcase, 
defaultif the 
defaultStrasb
defaulto
defaulturg Court
default makes a ruling, we have to accept its authority.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ76 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default If my colleagues will forgive me, I have missed the last two meetings on this and they may have covered this already, but my understanding in 
defaultr
defaultesp
defaultec
defaultt of the German constitution, for example, is that the German courts are not bound by the supremacy of courts of any other jurisdiction
default, but that there
default is a reserve that they are
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultStephen Hockmandefault: Yes.
default 
defaultI would not claim to be an expert on German constitutional law.
default 
defaultI think what you may be referring to there is a slightly different point, which is the extent to which
default,
default under German law
default,
default decisions 
defaultby 
defaultthe European Court of Justice in Luxembourg are accepted as binding.
default 
defaultThat is a slightly different issue.
default 
defaultI will not expand on that. 
defaultChair:default My 
defaultC
defaultlerk informs 
defaultthat 
defaultwe are 
defaultgoing to come
default back to this.
default 
defaultWe are taking evidence on that very matter in January, which I was not aware of.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ77 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Turner:default Just briefly.
default 
defaultThe trouble is 
defaultthat 
defaultwhat you have said 
defaultis that 
defaultit is okay for us, i.e. the British, to decide unless they
default—meaning the Europeans—
defaulthave already decided.
default 
defaultThe problem is it is not clear to people like me, and I am sure to most other people, whether we follow the British law or the European law, especially whe
defaultn
default they say absolutely conflicting things.
default 
defaultAt the moment
default,
default we do not have the position of them saying conflicting things, we have 
defaultBritain
default standing back and leaving it 
defaultto
default 
defaultEurope
default.
default 
defaultThe problem is
default,
default if you say, as you appear to say to me, that a decision by Europe supersedes decisions by 
defaultBritain
default, we have no standing. 
default&#xa0;
defaultStephen Hockmandefault: I have not said that decisions by Europe supersede decisions by 
defaultBritain
default.
default 
defaultI have said 
defaultthat, in general, 
defaultParliament and our courts do have the role of deciding what happens here.
default 
defaultI simply made the point that if you as an individual, Mr Turner, felt that our Government had breached your personal human rights, you have the ability to take your case to 
defaultStrasb
defaulto
defaulturg
default.
default 
defaultIf 
defaultStrasb
defaulto
defaulturg
default, in your particular case, makes a ruling that your human rights have been breached, for instance that 
defaultyou 
defaultwere held in custody for longer than you should have been for some reason, you have the right to go to 
defaultStrasb
defaulto
defaulturg
default, ultimately, and make a complaint and get a ruling. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ78 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Turner:default And 
defaultEurope
default decides.
default 
defaultAre you saying 
defaultthat 
defaultEurope
default decides? 
default&#xa0;
defaultStephen Hockmandefault: In your particular case, 
defaultEurope
default would be able to rule that your human rights had been abused.
defaultMr Turner:default In other words, Europe
default,
default not 
defaultBritain
default,
default decides. 
defaultStephen Hockmandefault: In that particular case, if you take your case to 
defaultStrasb
defaulto
defaulturg
default, being party to the Convention does enable 
defaultEurope
default to make that decision.
default 
defaultIs it not desirable?
default 
defaultI do agree 
defaultthat 
defaultthis ultimately is a political issue.
default 
defaultI would not dispute that for a moment, but is
defaultn’t
default there
default 
defaultroom in 
defaultour
default modern, globalise
defaultd
default world for a safety valve
default? 
defaultIs
defaultn’t
default there
default 
defaultroom,
default 
defaulteven in our democracy, for the view that there may be some rare, individual cases 
defaultfor which 
defaultthe ability 
defaultexists for 
defaultan individual to have his position reviewed—and we are talking about individuals here, we are talking about private 
defaultindividuals
default. 
defaultIs
defaultn’t
default it right for there to be a safety valve under which an individual can go to 
defaultStrasbourg
default?
defaultThere have
default been many cas
defaultes in the half century or so in which the Convention has applied in this country, long before the Human Rights Act came into force.
default 
defaultThere have been cases in which most people 
defaultwould 
defaultagree it has been a good thing for an individual to be able to take his case to 
defaultStrasbourg
default.
default 
defaultEven if you think that the cases coming from this country where that might be appropriate are very rare, surely everybody would agree that there 
defaultare 
defaultother countries
default,
default party to the Convention
default,
default where it is legitimate for people to be able to do that.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat I am saying to you is that
default,
default as long as
default,
default in the vast majority of cases
default,
default decisions by our Parliament and our courts are those that govern the outcome, as they do, it is
default,
default in the end
default,
default in the interests of people everywhere in Europe to have a safety valve, to have a fallback position and to be able to say that
default,
default in cases of real abuse
default,
default there is a
default 
defaultremedy.
default 
defaultYou have to balance these things and ultimately I agree it is for the public to decide whether that ultimate protection of 
defaultpeople
default’s liberties is worth having.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ79 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Turner:default You seem to me to be saying 
defaultthat 
defaultif an applicant for the right to vote, who is a prisoner
default—
defaultthat decision has been made, there is nothing we can do about it except stand back from the law.
default 
defaultAm I right?
default 
defaultI just want to know. 
default&#xa0;
defaultStephen Hockmandefault: 
defaultU
defaultnder our international obligations at the moment, in a particular case
default,
default if the 
defaultStrasbourg
default Court
default makes a ruling, then as a matter of international law, as I understand it, that is binding on our Government, yes.
default 
defaultOf course, it would be open to us—and I would regard this as a very retrograde step—to say that we are leaving the Convention, that we want to turn our backs on that.
default 
defaultI think
default 
defaultthat would set a terrible example in 
defaultEurope
default, but this is a political decision that we would have to consider.
defaultCan I just say we seem to have moved quite a long way from issues of codification but I was trying to answer
default the questions I was asked?
default&#xa0;
defaultQ80 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default It is a very helpful diversion, in many ways
default,
default because I was not asking you about the policy.
default 
defaultI think that was a matter of politics and elected people should decide those things.
default 
defaultI am not involved in one side or the other on a particular case.
default 
defaultWe all have strong views about particular cases, of course.
default 
defaultMy point was more about clarity, the fact that I don’t know, Mr Turner does not know, the man and woman in the street sometimes don’t know, 
defaultand 
defaultthat trying to make these things more transparent allows us to have a proper political debate.
default 
defaultAt the moment there are 20 different interpretations, for example on prisoners’ rights.
default 
defaultThere are thousands of different views on this.
default 
defaultWhile you can never have certainty, to have a degree of clarity
default—my 
defaultview that I am putting to you 
defaultis 
defaultthat the more clarity there is
default,
default the easier it is for us to make decisions and to understand the consequences of those decisions. 
default&#xa0;
defaultStephen Hockmandefault: I would agree with that.
default 
defaultCan I just say again, brin
defaultg
defaulting out the implications of what you have just said, in relation to the discussion that Mr Turner and I were just having, one of the things that a codified constitution probably ought to clarify—and until we had this discussion I do not think I was clear in my own mind about it as I am now—the relationship between our international obligations on the one hand and binding domestic law on the other.
default 
defaultThis is an area which it seems to me 
defaultis 
defaultdefinitely ripe for being made more explicit in a codification.
default 
defaultIt would help Mr Turner and me to be completely clear about the framework for our discussion if we had a six-point, 
defaultbullet-
defaultpoint summary of what the position is on that.
default 
defaultThen we would have that in front of us and then our decision about the public interest and about the political merits of the argument would be much better informed.
default 
defaultWe would know exactly what 
defaultthe 
defaultcommon ground
default was
default.
default 
defaultThat seems to me to be a very, very strong argument for codification.
defaultChair:default And then our politics could come into play if we were not happy about what our six points were and we could all have a view and change Government policy or whatever people felt was appropriate, but I don’t think we are at that point at the moment.
default 
defaultIt is very confused and very cloudy.
default 
defaultI have allowed a bit of a diversion there
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ81 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Flynn:default As these points were being made, and they came up last week, would you agree that the whole point of the move in the European 
defaultcourts 
defaultand the Convention o
defaultn
default Human Rights was not to improve law
default 
defaultmaking in this country or the Scandinavian cou
defaultn
defaulttries, wh
defaultich 
defaultare probably the ex
defaulte
defaultmp
defaultlar 
defaultthroughout 
defaultEurope
default?
default 
defaultThe whole point of it was to raise the standards for the 800 million people in 
defaultEurope
default,
default where there are outrageous practices on human rights.
default 
defaultIt was 
defaultreforming
default treaties and agreements that went through.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultIf we decide to make a fuss on a matter of microscopic insignificance such as prisoners’ votes, it gives a
defaultn open
default s
defaultes
defaultame to other countries
default,
default wh
defaultich
default have terrible standards to human rights, to insist on their traditions as well.
default 
defaultShould we not regard these objections, on a matter 
defaulton 
defaultwhich we probably should have taken a hit
default—
defaultprisoners’ rights
default—
defaultfor what they are, both from the right wing of the Conservative party and from 
defaultJ
defaultudge
default Judge,
default as unhelpful manifestations, spasms, of English national 
defaultinterest
default?
default&#xa0;
defaultChair:default Stephen, if
default 
defaultyou can answer the generality there rather than go back into a particular case, that would be helpful for the Committee. 
defaultStephen Hockmandefault: Speaking personally
default, I agree with you,
default but can I say in relation to codification I think the support that I would express for codification would apply
default,
default irrespective of one’s position on human rights
default? 
defaultYou could put aside human rights completely.
default 
defaultI think most people who are strong supporters of human rights are likely to support codification as well, but suppose, as some people are, you are sceptical about 
defaulthuman rights
default.
default 
defaultLet’s say you are a human rights sceptic.
default 
defaultI would not suggest that Mr Turner is a human rights sceptic; that would be presumptuous on my part, although I see that he is nodding.
default 
defaultSuppose you are a sceptic.
default 
defaultYou can still, it seems to me, be a strong supporter of codification because of the clarity that would bring.
defaultBy the way—and we have not touched on this; I don’t think there is time to do so—you could still be a strong supporter of using the mechanism in the Human Rights Act as a technique for introducing a codified constitution.
default 
defaultIn other words, to give that constitution not a supra-legislative status, not to turn it into something akin to the America constitution, which is almost a religion in its own right, but simply to have a piece of legislation
default,
default passed by Members of Parliament
default,
default equivalent to the Human Rights Act.
default 
defaultIf you are the sceptic, it would not contain much about human rights, but it would be a set of rules in which our constitution would become transparent.
default 
defaultIt could be amended, like 
defaultany
default other piece of legislation, but it would collect everything together and everybody would know the rules of the constitution, 
defaultand 
defaultthe relationship is between the Executive and the judiciary.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultAccording to press reports, Lord Judge has some views about the role 
defaultthat 
defaultthe judiciary should have in relation to funding decisions.
default 
defaultIt could, if Parliament so approves, contain provisions about that sort of thing.
default 
defaultThat would be the great benefit of it, and the role of the courts would be no greater than it is 
defaultunder 
defaultHuman Rights Act as it stands at the moment.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ82 default&#xa0; 
defaultFabian defaultHamiltondefault:default In your paper 
defaultTowards a Codified Constitution
default you
default 
defaultsta
defaultt
defaulte there a
defaultr
defaulte five broad possibilities for the types of power that judges could have if they deemed a piece of legislation to be unconstitutional.
default C
defaultould 
defaultyou 
defaulttell us what the main differences are between
default these options?
default&#xa0;
defaultStephen Hockmandefault: I will try.
default 
defaultI think that one might simplify it and shorten it in this way.
default 
defaultYou
default 
defaultcan boil them down into two.
default 
defaultIf you are going to have a codified constitution you have two main choices.
default 
defaultEither you 
defaulthave 
defaulta constitution which does have what I referred to a moment ago as supra-legislative status.
default 
defaultThis is a document that is binding not only on the courts and on individuals
default,
default but on Parliament.
default 
defaultUnless Parliament passes law
defaults
default that comply with the constitution, the judiciary can strike them down.
default 
defaultThat is, broadly speaking, the situation that applies in the 
defaultUSA
default, as I understand it.
default 
defaultYou have judicial review of the constitutionality of legislation.
defaultSpeaking personally, I do not support that.
default 
defaultI don’t think there is the slightest chance of such a constitutional measure ever being introduced or accepted in this jurisdiction.
default 
defaultIt seems to me pointless to go down that route. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ83 default&#xa0; 
defaultFabian defaultHamiltondefault:default Let me interrupt you a minute.
default 
defaultIs 
defaultt
defaulthat because at the moment the source o
defaultf
default all political authority and constitutional authority is Parliament here? 
default&#xa0;
defaultStephen Hockmandefault: Correct.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ84 default&#xa0; 
defaultFabian defaultHamiltondefault:default Parliament itself would never sacrifice its supremacy to a written document in the way that the 
defaultUnited States
default has?
default&#xa0;
defaultStephen Hockmandefault: I think
default 
defaultthat is true, but the reason for that is because the public will not support it either.
default 
defaultIt is not overweening arrogance on the part of Parliament; it is because Parliament would be reflecting our traditions and what the public in this country would desire.
default 
defaultThe point that those of who support codification would want to make, and if there is one message which in my evidence I can get across to you—and I am not the first person to say this by any means—it is that there is another way, the second way, of establishing a codified constitution 
defaultthat
default does not involve any diminution in Parliament’s power.
default 
defaultThat is to pass a constitutional 
defaultstatute
default equivalent to the Human Rights Act.
default 
defaultIt would include the Human Rights Act, if you are in favour of human rights.
default 
defaultIf you are not, it could exclude that.
default 
defaultLet’s not go there, let’s not have that argument, let’s not allow the constitutional debate to be wrenched out of context by human rights.
default 
defaultLet’s leave human rights aside for one moment and let’s acknowledge that your codified constitutional statute would be a piece of legislation 
defaultthat
default Parliament could amend.
default 
defaultSome people would say that it should be entrenched in the sense that you need a two-thirds major to change it, which might not be a bad idea, but you do not even need to have that.
default&#xa0;
defaultJust like the Human Rights Act, you
default 
defaultcould say it can be changed by Parliament but as long as it remains in force what the judges can do is consider whether other statutes, as well as decisions by public authorities—judges can consider whether there is compatibility between other measures and the constitutional statute.
default 
defaultThat would be the
default 
defaultrole of the courts in this area.
default 
defaultPresented with a piece of legislation or an administrative decision and being asked to decide whether there is compatibility between that measure and the constitutional statute, the 
defaultjudges 
defaultcould say yes or no, and they would be fulfilling their normal interpretative function.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt does not involve any change in the role of the judiciary; it does not involve politicising the judiciary.
default 
defaultThe role of the judiciary, as lawyers, would be to decide 
defaultwhether 
defaultth
defaulte
default measure
default—
defaultwhether it is a statute or a Government decision
default—is 
defaultcompatible with the constitution or not.
default 
defaultIf it is not, they would make that declaration and then leave it to Parliament to take the remedial action that was necessary.
default 
defaultThat is the mechanism, the system, that the Human Rights Act has introduced.
default 
defaultThat is what Lord Lester said, rightly, was the British compromise that his ingenuity and the ingenuity of others had arrived at.
default 
defaultIt is that mechanism, it is that system, which the Human Rights Act has 
defaultestablished, which some of us are suggesting could be borrowed and extended and applied for the purposes of a codificatory system.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ85 default&#xa0; 
defaultFabian Hamilton:default I agree with everything you have said, but let me challenge you on something you said, an assumption you made, which is the public would rather Parliament was the supreme authority for political and constitutional rights than a document.
default 
defaultSurely in a climate where there is a very low regard for elected politicians and political parties, don’t you think the public might prefer to have a rather more immutable document that is not subject to the vagaries of political chance or electoral fortunes that go to make up the composition of Parliament after every general election and for the next five years?
default 
defaultSurely something that is far more stable and does not depend on voting and politicians, who are widely loathed.
default&#xa0;
defaultStephen Hockmandefault: I suppose that a historian would probably answer your question in the affirmative in the sense that there have been examples throughout history 
defaultof 
defaultsomething that is over and above the democratic process—this would not be true of the 
defaultUSA
default.
default 
defaultThe United States constitution 
defaulti
defaults
default probably
default, most people 
defaultwould 
defaultagree, rather a splendid example of democracy in action because of their particular history and the achievement of the founding fathers, endorsed by Abraham Lincoln and so no.
default 
defaultNobody would say that was not democratic.
defaultBut there have been other examples where, outside the democratic process, something comes into existence, a constitution or an institution or even an individual, into which, for the time being, a vast majority of people place their trust.
default 
defaultI would be sceptical of that, personally.
default 
defaultI would not want to see a situation in which the scepticism of the public about politics, which I obviously agree we have at the moment, were to be remedied by some sort of supra-political device of the kind that you are referring to.
default 
defaultForgive 
defaultme 
defaultfor slightly oversimplifying the concept you were putting to me.
default 
defaultI don’t think that is the way forward at all.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat we need to do, it seems to me, is restore the trust of the public in the political process.
default 
defaultMy personal view is that moving towards codification, literally by the work that you are doing here, not assuming what the outcome is going to be but engaging in serious and anxious study or scrutiny of the subject, is the way to do it.
default 
defaultAnybody who listens to your debates—not to my evidence but to your discussion of the subject—would begin to have their faith in politics restored.
default 
defaultThat is the way you have to do it.
default 
defaultYou have to do it by slow and steady and serious work.
default 
defaultThere is no other way of doing it
default, and, by
default the way, not by introducing things like referendums all over the place, because that does not restore faith in politics either, in my opinion.
default&#xa0;
defaultFabian defaultHamiltondefault:default Or the recall of MPs. 
defaultStephen Hockmandefault: That is another matter too.
default I think 
defaultthere is no substitute—it is extremely presumptuous of me to say this—for doing your job seriously and sensibly and carefully and then going out into public arenas and on to the media and explaining what you are doing.
default 
defaultThat is the only way you will ever do it and it is exactly what you are doing.
defaultChair:default Thank you very much for that confidence.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ86 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Flynn:default You are against having a separate constitutional 
defaultcourt
default.
default 
defaultWhy? 
default&#xa0;
defaultStephen Hockmandefault: Yes, I am against that personally, because that would only be relevant if you had this biblical document.
default 
defaultIf you had a biblical document, then you might need a separate court.
default 
defaultEven then I suppose the existing Supreme Court could possibly fulfil that role.
default 
defaultIn most people’s thinking a separate constitutional court is completely unnecessary unless you have a separate constitution.
defaultAs you know, in the USA
default,
default where they have a constitution that has this supra-legislative status, they do not have a separate constitutional court.
default 
defaultThe Supreme Court in the 
defaultUnited States
default exercises judicia
defaultl
default review of legislation, but it also has the slightly more modest functions of our own Supreme Court.
default 
defaultI think that to talk about setting up an entirely new constitutional court is quite beside the point.
default 
defaultIt would be 
defaultunnecessary
default; it would be a drain on public funds.
default 
defaultI would have thought that was an unnecessary 
defaultdistraction
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ87 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Flynn:default You say that you believe that politicians and the people should decide whether we have a codified constitution.
default 
defaultI look forward to the day when I march behind you and the Chairman of this Committee with a banner saying, “What do we want?
default 
defaultA codified constitution.
default 
defaultWhen do we want it?
default 
defaultWhen it is necessary and required.
default 
defaultWhen will we get it?
default 
defaultWhen we become sufficiently anti-European”.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultWhat role do you see the judiciary playing in this, particularly on 
defaultthe 
defaultgrounds that 
defaultt
defaulthey are probably the only people who will fully understand what is being offered? 
default&#xa0;
defaultStephen Hockmandefault: Let me make two brief points.
default 
defaultFirst, if the approach that I personally advocate is the correct one, the role of the judiciary will be, as it is now, an important one in interpreting and applying the constitutional statute and in ruling whether other legislation and administrative action are compatible with the constitutional statute or not.
default 
defaultThat would be their role, the same as it is now.
defaultThere is a further point, and
default this goes back to w
defaulthat I was saying about the developing role of the judiciary in establishing principles.
default 
defaultI got the impression that that point was seen as a little surprising and that it was not one that could readily be accepted.
default 
defaultI agree that this is something fairly new.
default 
defaultIt flows to some extent from the growth of judicial review as a legal tool, as a part of our law.
default 
defaultPublic law
default,
default we sometimes call it, or administrative law.
default 
defaultIt is the judiciary articulating principles that then apply in future cases.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe point I am see
defaultk
defaulting to make here is that if, as I suspect is the case, the public have respect 
defaultfor
default the judiciary, if the public approve
defaults
default of that process, if the public welcome
defaults
default judgments in which principles are articulated and in which they can understand the reasoning behind the decisions, if those decisions clearly reflect the public interest, as many of them do—not all—but if many of them are couched in language and with reasoning that the public can understand—and the decisions of people like Lord Bingham and 
defaultof 
defaultthe current Supreme Court generally achieve that—that in itself unquestionably enhances public confidence in our system of Government as a whole.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultI think that through this developing role of the judiciary, through their increasing importance in our constitutional settlement, we are at the same time helping to re
default-
defaultestablish confidence in the political system.
default 
defaultWhat I would say is that alongside the work that you are doing, the serious work that 
defaultyou 
defaultare doing, alongside attempts by bodies such as this Committee to re
default-
defaultestablish public confidence in the system, you should see the judges—again I am sounding rather presumptuous if not pompous in saying this—as your partners in that exercise.
default 
defaultYou 
defaultshould 
defaults
defaultee
default the judges as helping to make transparent the principles that ought to apply, as helping to articulate what the public interest is in particular circumstances, not as somehow competing with you, but as complementing the role that you have. 
defaultThey
default 
defaultare doing that, particularly at Supreme Court level, by deciding individual cases on their facts, as they have to do, but doing it in a particular way, doing it by articulating principles and by explaining what the justification for those principles may be.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere was a philosopher who died recently called Ronald Dw
defaulto
defaultrkin, who articulated particularly clearly this aspect of the judicial role.
default 
defaultIt seems to me that it is worth acknowledging that aspect of the judicial role as part of a truly usefully and democratic constitution.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ88 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Flynn:default That is very helpful.
default 
defaultJust a final point: in the case of Newport Corporation v Ma
defaultgor and
default St Mel
defaultl
defaultons Council in 1952, which I am sure you are very familiar with— 
default&#xa0;
defaultStephen Hockmandefault: Only from reading the transcript.
defaultPaul Flynn:default I am particularly interested because it is the area that I
default now 
defaultrepresent.
default 
defaultIt was a fascinating decision in that Lord Denning too
defaultk
default the view that the situation
default 
defaultwas unprecedented and it had not been foreseen by Parliament
default, and if 
defaultParliament had foreseen it, they would have taken a certain view, which he supplied.
default 
defaultThis was overturned by the House of Lords
default,
default 
defaultwhich 
defaultsaid the judiciary is making the law instead of Parliament making the law.
default 
defaultWhere do we get to the idea that depending on politicians, the people in Parliament, we elevate Parliament to a role and we give them infallibility, which no one deserves?
default 
defaultWe know the imperfections of our legislative process.
default              
defaultWhere should that line be drawn
default in having
default an immutable code that is laid 
defaultdown 
defaultand common sense decisions
default,
default depending on unprecedented situations
default that arise?
default&#xa0;
defaultStephen Hockmandefault: Lord Denning was at the height of his powers when I started in practice 40-plus years ago, so I remember those days quite well.
default 
defaultWhat I have been saying is that I think this conception of the role of the judiciary is a relatively recent one.
default 
defaultIf you go back to the days of Lord Denning, Lord Denning’s creativity as a judge was rather unusual.
default 
defaultThe idea of a judge who went a little further than simply applying black-letter law and who articulated principles that were consonant with the public mood was a somewhat unusual notion in those days, which is why Lord Denning appeared
default to be an e
defaultxceptional figure and perhaps sometimes an unorthodox and controversial figure.
defaultIt seems to me, being
default 
defaultno less presumptuous tha
defaultn
default I have been in my earlier answers, that we have moved forward a good deal since then
default. We
default have moved to a situation where the judges generally feel much more comfortable in, to some extent at 
defaultleast
default, doing exactly what Lord Denning did
default—
defaultbeing independent minded, articulating principles that apply to cases, but at the same time doing so while giving full respect to legislation and to the decisions of Parliament and working alongside Parliament.
default 
defaultI think they have become more Denning-like in their approach but without contradicting the will of Parliament.
default 
defaultThat is where we are now.
default&#xa0;
defaultChair:default Stephen, that is incredibly helpful.
default 
defaultThank you very much indeed.
default 
defaultAs clear and articulate as 
defaulta
defaultlways.
default 
defaultWe appreciate you
defaultr
default testimony this morning.
default&#xa0;
defaultExamination of WitnessdefaultWitness
default:
default 
defaultNat Le Rouxdefault, Director, Constitution Society, gave evidence.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ89 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Nat, glad to see you here.
default 
defaultWelcome.
default 
defaultSorry that we have kept you.
default 
defaultWe had a little journey to 
defaultEurope
default and back, which I 
defaultthought
default was helpful because I think there are issues there that do need to be addressed by the Committee.
default 
defaultMy apologies for missing your event a week or so ago
default. I was ill unfortunately
default, but I shall get to the next one.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultDid you
default 
defaultwant to say anything to kick u
defaults
default off or are you happy to jump straight into questions? 
default&#xa0;
defaultNat Le Rouxdefault: Let’s just go straight to questions.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ90 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Turner:default Could you briefly describe the role of the judiciary in the 
defaultUK
default’s 
defaultcurrent constitutional arrangements? 
default&#xa0;
defaultNat Le Rouxdefault: The current role of the judiciary in judicial reviews is essentially ensuring that Central 
defaulta
defaultnd Local Government and public bodies act within the powers conferred on them by Parliament.
default 
defaultThat is filtered through the judges’ idea of the rule of law, rather as the previous witness was describing.
default 
defaultThe best short formulation of what it seems to me the judiciary in general thinks about this is in Lord Bingham’s book on the rule of law, where he says, and this is how the rule of law app
defaultl
defaulties to this particular context
default,
default “Ministers and public officers at all levels must exercise the powers conferred on them in good faith, fairly, for the purpose for which the powers were conferred, without exceeding the limits of such powers and not unreasonably.”
default 
defaultThat is a general statement of what one imagines is going through the judiciary’s mind when they are making decisions in these cases.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ91 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Turner:default One of our witnesses, Dr Elliott, drew a distinction between a flat and a hierarchical constitution.
default 
defaultWhich is more appropriate to the 
defaultUK
default? 
default&#xa0;
defaultNat Le Rouxdefault: I use a different language 
defaultfrom 
defaultthat.
default 
defaultIf we are talking about some form of codification, there are two possible methods.
default 
defaultOne is to go back to the drawing board and write something like the new South Africa
defaultn
default 
defaultconstitution 
defaultof 20 years ago, where effectively we reform the state and lay
default 
defaultout in great detail the powers of different 
defaultorgans 
defaultof state and how they relate to each other and so on.
defaultThe second approach is to gather exi
defaults
defaultting constitutional material into one place, metaphorically 
defaultin 
defaulta large, leather-bound volume, and label that material as being constitutional.
default 
defaultThere are some quite significant practical problems with that.
default 
defaultI think we all know what the major constitutional statutes are, but there are lots of things of constitutional importance that are buried in other statutes.
default 
defaultThere is lots of non-statutory material, the 
defaultCabinet Manual
default, for example,
default and to what extent is
default that part of the constitution, and there are lots of arrangements that are purely customary.
default 
defaultThat is a practical difficulty.
default&#xa0;
defaultGoing on from that, the idea that judges might get involved in assessing the validity of primary legislation against some constitution I think is a separate issue to that of codification.
default 
defaultThe best example of that is in 
defaultIsrael
default.
default 
defaultIsrael
default has no codified constitution
default,
default but a practice has developed whereby their legislature labels or certifies some laws as being constitutional and,
default 
defaultshould there be a conflict, the Israeli courts will then give primacy to those constitutional or so-called basic laws over other laws.
default 
defaultThat is an example on the one hand.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultO
defaultn the other hand we have the Dutch constitution, which although it is codified in the conventional sense and all
default 
defaultthe
default 
defaultrules laid out, it specifically forbids the judiciary from opining on the validity of primary legislation.
default 
defaultThese two issues, although often wrapped into one, I think are in principle separate.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ92 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Turner:default If the 
defaultUK
default adopted a codified constitution, would that give it a higher status or not? 
default&#xa0;
defaultNat Le Rouxdefault: I think there are two or three different things that could happen.
default 
defaultThe simplest thing that Parliament could do 
defaultis 
defaultto do what happens in 
defaultIsrael
default and say that from now on we are going to label certain laws as being constitutional laws, which does not happen at the moment.
default 
defaultAll laws, once passed, are the same, at least in theory.
default 
defaultIf that happens, the judiciary would no doubt, over time as cases came to them—because of course an important point with understanding judicial 
defaultreview is its haphazard nature.
default 
defaultIt is not as if the judges can wake up and decide to go and review something that they do not like the look of.
default 
defaultThey have to wait for an applicant and a ju
defaultst
defaulticiable issue and a case.
defaultThat would be the simplest thing.
default 
defaultEffectively collecting together some laws currently on the statute book and calling them constitutional would over time have the same effect, because very likely the judges would take notice of that.
default 
defaultIf you had a fully codified constitution and it was a new constitution along the lines that most countries have, that constitution would have rules in it about the circumstances in which judges could review legislation, or indeed it might not have such rules, because
default,
default contrary to what is generally believed, the 
defaultUS
default constitution does not provide for judicia
defaultl
default review.
default 
defaultThe role that the Supreme Court took on, going back to Marb
defaultu
defaultry v 
defaultMadison
default, which is the famous case at the beginning of the 19th century, was to adopt for themselves this power to review legislation.
default 
defaultIt is not in the constitution.
default&#xa0;
defaultA rather similar case more recently 
defaultwa
defaults in Denmark.
default 
defaultThe Danish constitution says nothing about judicial review but the Danish courts ha
defaultve
default started in practice to review legislation in that 
defaultUS
default sort of way.
default 
defaultThere are no hard answers to any of these questions.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ93 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Turner:default I think I heard you say the judges cannot wake up one morning and decide to look at this.
default 
defaultThey can only do so if somebody else has tried to change the law.
default 
defaultIs there anything that prevents them from doing so? 
default&#xa0;
defaultNat Le Rouxdefault: Judges in our jurisdiction, and it is the same in the 
defaultUS
default, only get to hear cases if an 
defaultappellant
default brings a case to them.
default 
defaultThe judiciary cannot create its own cases.
defaultWe have a different situation in the minority of countries that have proper constitutional courts, i.e. 
defaultthe
default Austrian model, where there is a 
defaultspecific
default court, as we were hearing earlier, which does not try normal cases.
default 
defaultIts role is to opine on the constitutionality of all new legislation, but that is quite unusual and certainly very far from where we are in the 
defaultUK
default at the moment.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ94 default&#xa0; 
defaultFabian Hamilton:default Mr Le Roux, Professor Le Sueur told us that were the UK to adopt a codified constitution, he
default,
default “
defaultw
defaultould like to see the preservation of the principle of Parliamentary supremacy so our elected representatives in Parliament would have the final say on the content of legislation, rather than constitutional supremacy in which a judicial body would have a veto on unconstitutional legislation.”
default 
defaultI wondered what your view was. 
default&#xa0;
defaultNat Le Rouxdefault: I think it is rather difficult and it is made more difficult by the fact that there is not very much consensus at the moment, as far as I can see, as to what the exact relationship between the role of the judiciary and Parliament’s role is.
default 
defaultYou hear some extreme statements, which most people 
defaultwould 
defaultsay were incorrect.
default 
defaultWe had the view of two judges, famously in the 
defaultJackson
default case a few years ago
default,
default to the effect that parliamentary sovereignty is a creation of the common law.
default 
defaultIn other words, in extreme circumstances the Supreme Court can strike down legislation.
default 
defaultProbably the majority of judges do not think that.
default 
defaultWe don’t know
default;
default we only have these two judges who said that.
defaultOn the other hand you sometimes hear the view, perhaps from Members of this House, that Parliament can legislate as it likes without restriction.
default 
defaultIf you
default 
defaultexamine that, a number of questions come up.
default 
defaultThe first point that I would 
defaultmake 
defaultis 
defaultthat 
defaultthere are clearly practical restrictions on Parliament’s ability to legislate as it 
defaultwould 
defaultlike.
default 
defaultIt would be rather difficult, to reverse Scottish devolution at this stage
default,
default in practice.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ95 default&#xa0; 
defaultFabian defaultHamiltondefault:default It is technically possible, isn’t it? 
default&#xa0;
defaultNat Le Rouxdefault: Indeed.
default 
defaultIt is technically possible for the British Parliament to decide that 
defaultCanada
default’s independence is to be withdrawn.
default 
defaultWhat would follow from that
default,
default one may ask.
default 
defaultI think you are asking 
defaultwhether 
defaultthere 
defaultare 
defaultalso legal or normative restrictions on parliamentary sovereignty, and here we get into much more contested territory.
default 
defaultGoing back to the previous discussion, I think most people would say that the 
defaultUK
default does have obligations under international law that Parliament cannot vary in the context of international law.
default 
defaultFor example, Parliament might take the view that embarking on a particular war was a legal and proper thing to do, but that would not, at an international level, prevent that war 
defaultfrom 
defaultbeing held to be illegal.
defaultThe question that I always ask people, to pin them down when the
defaulty
default express a strong support for parliamentary sovereignty, is
default,
default do they believe that citizens have rights 
defaultthat
default Parliament cannot take away, or do they not believe that
default? 
defaultThe logic of the position is that 
defaultt
defaulthey must believe that citizens have at least one right, which is the right to vote.
default 
defaultThe whole intellectual underpinning of the modern doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty is democratic legitimacy.
default 
defaultIt was not so in the 19
defaultth
default century.
default 
defaultIndeed, most people, when asked the question in a neutral way, would say that they did have rights which Parliament could not or ought not to be able to take away.
default 
defaultThere is no way you can go away and look up the answer to this question.
default 
defaultWhat we see in all of these situations is just a reflection of the general view mutating over time.
default&#xa0;
defaultComing to the particular issue here, who owns the rule of law?
default 
defaultIs there some higher principle of the rule of law which in certain circumstances might 
defaultt
defaultrump
default parliamentary 
defaultsovereignty?
default 
defaultThe difficulty there is that the judges and Parliament, or the Government, might have different views about what the rule of law meant in certain particular circumstances.
default&#xa0;
defaultGoing back to our recent 
defaulte
defaultvents, the practical question here is if Parliament were to introduce primary legislation 
defaultthat
default the judges believed to be contrary to the rule of law
default,
default as they understood it, what would they do about it
default? 
defaultThat is the particular difficulty we might be confronting at the moment with the current Government consultation exercise.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ96 default&#xa0; 
defaultFabian defaultHamiltondefault:default We have discussed already this morning, 
defaultand you, in reply
default to Mr Turner, 
defaultmentioned 
defaultjudicial review and some of the processes in the 
defaultUK
default.
default 
defaultI wonder how judicial review here differs from countries where there is a codified constitution. 
default&#xa0;
defaultNat Le Rouxdefault: A
defaults
default I 
defaultunderstand
default it, the great majority, probably all countries which are essentially democratic, rule
default-
defaultof
default-
defaultlaw jurisdictions, have some form of judicial review whereby appellants can go to the court and say, “This official has acted beyond his appropriate powers or he has behaved unfairly”.
default 
defaultHow likely those applications are to succeed is another matter.
default 
defaultI think I am right in saying that in 
defaultSingapore
default, in the whole history of the republic, there has been no successful application for judicial review despite the fact that that process exists in principle.
default 
defaultThat form of judicial review against the actions of officials is quite general.
default 
defaultThe other sort of judicial review, which is judicial review of legislation, can only happen if there is some higher benchmark against which to judge its legitimacy.
default 
defaultThat higher benchmark normally in most states is a codified constitution.
default 
defaultAs I said earlier, it does not need to be.
default 
defaultIn the case of 
defaultIsrael
default we just have two different sorts of law, which have different priority.

defaultPaul Flynn:default On the question of irreversible changes taking place, I recall that Enoch Powell went to see Prime Minister Winston Churchill and urged him to re
default-
defaultcol
defaulton
defaultise 
defaultIndia
default, so there are people who do have ambitions to change what to most of us would seem irreversible.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultCould we take up a point made by our previous witness in saying that he did not think we would achieve a codified constitution
default,
default but it is benefi
defaultcial
default, certainly education
defaultal
default to MPs, to discuss this and to consider the consequence of it?
default 
defaultWhat is your view?
default 
defaultAre we going to get there? 
default&#xa0;
defaultNat Le Rouxdefault: If you look at international comparators, when countries come up with brand new constitutions it is in the context of some sort of general political crisis 
defaultthat
default requires a reformation of the state, in other words a change from one regime to another or the 
defaultgranting
default of independence of the settlement of a civil war of something of that nature.
default 
defaultSouth Africa
default is a good example.
default 
defaultI would rephrase the question and ask how likely it is that something like that is going to happen in the 
defaultUK
default in the foreseeable future.
default 
defaultIt is probably unlikely, although Scottish independence, if it happened, might just be such an event, so it is not to be completely ruled out.
defaultIn the absence of that, is anything in the codification direction very likely to happen?
default 
defaultI think there is some merit in assembling the obvious constitutional legislation and putting a big constitution label on the cover.
default 
defaultHow far that takes us I am not sure.
default 
defaultThe change that I would like to see, and I have argued this before this Committee before, is a much simpler one, where Parliament itself simply starts labelling, when appropriate, new laws as being constitutional.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ98 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Flynn:default Lord Lester last week resisted the idea that 
defaultParliaments here 
defaultof all parties have become more willing to release power through the devolution process to 
defaultScotland
default, 
defaultWales
default and 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default and to 
defaultEurope
default as well.
default 
defaultHe gave an example of that
default—
defaultpossibly that is not going on
default—
defaultthat Parliament is as power 
defaultre
defaulttentive as ever.
default 
defaultHe used the example of prisoners’ rights to vote.
default 
defaultDo you find that the process is going on and it is a sl
defaultip
defaultpery slope and that it will continue and that power will be devolved from Parliament in the way that it has been over the last 20 years? 
default&#xa0;
defaultNat Le Rouxdefault: It is a complex question because several different things seem to me to be happening at once.
default 
defaultOne thing, as you say, is it is in line with Britain’s relative decline in the world and the process of accession to the EU that Parliament has 
defaultsacrificed
default, in practice if not in theory, an area of authority to other jurisdiction.
default 
defaultIt has also sacrificed authority within the 
defaultUK
default to other jurisdictions through the process of devolution.
defaultIn the core area, over which Parliament still appears to have an untrammelled authority, there are further difficulties, again referred to in previous evidence
default,
default trying to pin down what the extent of that 
defaultsovereignty
default is, when the courts are becoming perhaps more assertive in talking about principles rather than simply the interpretation of legislation.
default 
defaultI think that in turn reflects a general decay in relations between the law and Parliament that has been going on for some time.
default 
defaultSome of that is just the general siloing of 
defaultelites
default 
defaultthat
default seems to have occurred over the last 50 years or more.
default 
defaultAt one time, 
defaultthe
default mythical golden age, there were quite a lot of MPs who worked as QCs in the morning and then came to Parliament in the afternoon.
default 
defaultThose people existed but there aren’t very many of them anymore.
default&#xa0;
defaultI think a significant event in that process of breakdown of relationships was the Constitutional Reform Act of 2005, which, on paper, looked quite sensible because it removed this rather anomalous position of the Lord Chancellor and seemed to be a move towards the 
defaultfull
default separation of powers which would be normal in most countries.
default 
defaultBut 
defaultthe effect
default of it was further breakdown in communication, I believe, because
default of
default this rather odd position that the Lord Chancellor had was an important link between the legislature and the judiciary and a safety valve when things went wrong.
default 
defaultNow the Lord Chancellor is just another Minister who is not even a lawyer at the moment.
default 
defaultAt the same time, 
defaultthe 
defaultsenior judiciary, while they are still on the bench, no longer sit in the Lords, although they come back afterwards.
default&#xa0;
defaultAt one time, and this is carica
defaultt
defaultu
defaultri
defaultng it slightly, this country was run by an establishment of people who might have gone to the same schools and had similar ideas about how things ought to work, and a lot of that was never written down in any formal way.
default 
defaultThose understandings, for good or ill, are breaking down.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ99 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Flynn:default I am sure you are encouraged, as we are, b
defaulty
default the evidence of increased public interest in a codified constitution
default: what
default has happened behind you since you started to speak.
default 
defaultA final question: how would the current model for judicial review in the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default be likely to change if a codified constitution was adopted? 
default&#xa0;
defaultNat Le Rouxdefault: I think, as we were saying earlier, it would very much depend what that codified constitution was.
default 
defaultThe mere effect of labelling some legislation as being constitutional, even if it is existing 
defaultlegislation
default, opens the doors for the court to review other legislation against it, and I think that 
defaultt
defaulthat would happen.
default 
defaultIf we were to go the full
default-blown
default new constitution route, I think it would be sensible for that constitution to say something about what the role of the judiciary ought to be.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ100 default&#xa0; 
defaultFabian defaultHamiltondefault:default Thank you, Nat.
default 
defaultIs there anything that you would like to say, anything left unsaid?
default 
defaultThis is your moment? 
default&#xa0;
defaultNat Le Rouxdefault: Just at the risk of advertising our own activities, I will go back to the seminar that you were not able to attend, Chairman.
default 
defaultSomething that is going on at the moment that is highly relevant to 
defaultt
defaulthis is the Government consultation exercise on 
defaultthe 
defaultscope of judicial review.
default 
defaultSome of that is about administrative tidying up and efficiency and is uncontroversial, but some of it is not.
default 
defaultTwo proposals particularly are, I think, worrying in their implications.
default 
defaultOne is the on the question of standing.
default 
defaultAt the moment, even an unaffected party may apply for judicial review if there is a public interest involved.
default 
defaultThe people who make these applications are typically NGOs.
default 
defaultThe suggestion in the consultation exercise is that that should be stopped.
default 
defaultIn other words, someone has to have a direct interest where they have been personally affected before they may apply.
default&#xa0;
defaultAt the same time there is another proposal in the consultation exercise whereby protective costs orders—the orders that immunise the applicant from picking up the defence costs, the Government costs, if he loses—should only be available if people do not have a direct interest.
default 
defaultYou can see how the combined effect of those two measures would very severely reduce the set of people who were ever capable of applying for judicial review.
default 
defaultThey would have to be wealthy people with a direct interest.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat is the reaction of the judiciary going to be if these measures are introduced?
default 
defaultIt is far from certain that they will go along with it.
default 
defaultThey may take the view that in this particular instance there is a higher principle of ru
defaultl
defaulte of law that they will use as a way of, in effect, not accepting this.
default 
defaultWe have had other examples of that in the past where 
defaultouster
default clauses in legislation—a clause in a statute that says the courts may not review the validity of this act or the legality of this action—have been politely ignored by the judges.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis comes back to the question not what is the truth of it, because the truth of it is what people believe.
default 
defaultWhat do judges believe
default—
defaultthat they are guardians of something called the rule of law, which sits separate to the authority of Parliament?
default 
defaultI personally believe it is the proposition that is best not tested.
default 
defaultIf these Government proposals go ahead it is going to be tested.
default&#xa0;
defaultChair:default That is very thought provoking.
default 
defaultI shall think about what you have said and at the very least I think we will clip that piece of your evidence and make sure that our colleagues on the Justice Committee, who may well be looking at this matter, I am sure they are, have that in front of them.
default 
defaultIt is a matter for them if they wish to call you, of course, but I will bring that to the attention of my fellow Chair o
defaultf

default              
defaultThank you so much.
default 
defaultI hope you did not feel this was too truncated and that you have been able to say everything you
default 
defaultwanted to.
default 
defaultI know that colleagues are very keen to leave the Committee and hear the Chancellor’s autumn statement, so I had better close the Committee proceedings now.
