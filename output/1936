EIS 04
[normal]Written evidence submitted by the British Aggregates Association (BAA)[bold]Executive Summary[bold]The UK has an active domestic 
[normal]minerals 
[normal]extract
[normal]ion
[normal] industry providing national wealth, employment and resource security 
[normal]to the construction industry and 
[normal]to
[normal] a wide spectrum of consumer and manufacturing  industries.  The UK also has abundant reserves and the sector could grow and provide
[normal] additional employment and resource security.
[normal]In addition the industry has an enviable and world-leading reputation for the highest level of restoration and after-care following mineral extraction (generally over and above planning requirements)  with resp
[normal]ect to landscape, tree planting,  environment and to biodiversity and geodiversity. 
[normal]The sector would benefit from 
[normal]The publicly listed mining houses on the UK Stock Market and with London HQs generally have little direct involvement in  any of the UK domestic 
[normal]mining industry
[normal]. 
[normal]The UK minerals extraction industry is 
[normal]represented through the CBI 
[normal]Minerals Group
[normal]. The broader stakeholder interests for the industry sector including national, regional and local government and NGOs is through the UK National Minerals Forum established for this purpose in 2007. I
[normal]n addition 
[normal]the industry engage with 
[normal]Westmi
[normal]nster
[normal] through the A
[normal]ssociate
[normal] Parliamentary Minerals Group
[normal] (AP
[normal]MG)
[normal]. 
[normal]The
[normal] 
[normal]UK 
[normal]minerals
[normal] extraction
[normal] industry has not been involved with the EITI initiative which appears to be of little consequence to
[normal] our sector. However, we do note that HMG reiterated its econom
[normal]ic and growth policy objectives in item (8) of its notes to the
[normal] EITI launch
[normal] 
[normal]Press Release
[normal] dated 9
[normal]th
[normal] July which we do fully support. 
[normal] 
[normal]We trus
[normal]t that 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]EITI 
[normal]initiative will not 
[normal]make
[normal] any additional imposition
[normal]s
[normal] on
[normal] an already overburdened and regulated
[normal] 
[normal]domestic minerals industry compared to our colleagues in other countries; and particularly not to SMEs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction and Background[bold]This response 
[normal]is on behalf of the 
[normal]B
[normal]ritish Aggregates Association
[normal] 
[normal](BAA)
[normal]  as well as for 
[normal]The Barytes Association
[normal] (TBA)
[normal] of which I am Director
[normal];
[normal] and also various other interests in the minerals industry in the UK, Europe and globally gained in over 40 years experience mainly at the sharp end of industry.
[normal]BAA
[normal] represent
[normal]s
[normal] the interests of 
[normal]some 11
[normal]0 members of which some 
[normal]70
[normal] are independent and privatel
[normal]y-owned SME quarry companies throughout the UK with some 1
[normal]3
[normal]% of national output and who operate out of 
[normal]some
[normal] 
[normal]30
[normal]0 sites.
[normal] 
[normal]TBA members provide 
[normal]globally 
[normal]two-thirds of the barytes consumed in the oil and gas drilling, TV and PC glass, and automotive industries.
[normal] There are three UK members who mine and produce barytes and fluorspar domestically, one 
[normal]of whom operates
[normal] in a National Park.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] I am an active member of the CBI Minerals Group and also of the UK National Minerals Forum which 
[normal]includes central, devolved
[normal] and 
[normal]local government officials,
[normal] planners, heritage groups and NGOs as well as industry representatives
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]I also belong to the Mining Association of the UK; and 
[normal]am
[normal] a member of two professional associations for 
[normal]the
[normal] industry
[normal] -
[normal] IOM3 (Institute of Materials, Minera
[normal]ls and Mining) and IOQ (Institute of Quarrying). 
[normal] 
[normal]I am involved with the activities of
[normal] Euromines
[normal] and through them an EU Commission Expert Group the 
[normal]Raw Materials Supply Group
[normal] which includes industry, the Commission and member state representatives
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Submission [bold]We have restricted our comments  to only the first of the
[normal] questions  laid out in your  submission of evidence
[normal] dated
[normal] 3
[normal]rd
[normal] July
[normal] 2013
[normal].
[normal]What is the contribution to the UK economy of extractive industries in the UK? [bold]The UK has an active domestic industry producing 
[normal]well 
[normal]over 200Mt of minerals annually in addition to o
[normal]il and gas
[normal], and provide both employment and resource security
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal](Further detail is included in the submission by the CBI Minerals Group).
[normal] 
[normal]A high proportion of the tonnage is land-won aggregates for the construction industry, 
[normal]and extracted material only tr
[normal]avels short distances (under 30km average) to the next customer 
[normal]meeting local requirements and 
[normal]which minimises environmental footprint and 
[normal]transportation
[normal] - 
[normal]and which meet
[normal] 
[normal]proximity
[normal] 
[normal]principles
[normal] .  
[normal]M
[normal]any industrial minerals feed the wider economy  and key ind
[normal]ustries like the chemical, metals and electronics, high tech industries and the manufacturing sector more generally
[normal] such as barytes,   fluorspar,
[normal] 
[normal]industrial high-purity  limestone, metallurgical coke and silica sands.
[normal]Minerals extraction is a rural industr
[normal]y and individual companies live in and engage with the local community and all stakeholders. The level of restoration and aftercare is of high standards and generally over that required in the planning permission. BAA is part of the 
[normal]Nature After Minerals
[normal] programme a partnership between Nat6ural England, RSPB and industry.
[normal]There is considerable potential for a higher level of extraction
[normal] which provide
[normal] a g
[normal]reate
[normal]r p
[normal]roportion
[normal] of national need and reduc
[normal]e
[normal] import dependence and potential future supply risk
[normal]. 
[normal]This is fully endorsed in the Government’s  
[normal]Resource Security Action Plan
[normal] of
[normal] March 2012, paragraph 21.
[normal]This al
[normal]so provides growth for both our
[normal] sector and any manufacturing renaissance, and reduces the cost of purchasing materials from outside the UK and the sterling area . 
[normal]The EU recognised in 2008 the increasing need for indigeno
[normal]us supply and to improve the 
[normal]planning 
[normal]access to
[normal],
[normal] and the investment potential for
[normal],
[normal] domestic sourcing in their 
[normal]Raw Material Initiative
[normal].
[normal] This also identified specific strategic minerals t
[normal]hat were at particular risk, 
[normal]many of which are geologically available in the UK and 
[normal]which included fluor
[normal]spar and barytes which are already extracted here.
[normal]The British Geological Survey (BGS) and Camborne School of Mines (Exeter University) have also highli
[normal]ghted similar 
[normal]concerns
[normal] for UK supply
[normal] and security
[normal].
