[normal] 
[normal]OBSERVATIONS
[normal]I have noted your terms of reference and will address each one in turn 
[normal]below:-
[normal]2.1.0
[normal]              
[normal]the extent to which members of the public are aware of the competent persons scheme and that certain domestic electrical works need to be reviewed and certified to meet the requirements of Building Regulations;
[normal]2.1.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The “Gas Safe” and previous schemes have been around for many years and are still not universally known by the public. I am sure the public are aware of the need for safety in connection with gas appliances but checking to see if they are “Gas Safe” regist
[normal]ered is 
[normal]still 
[normal]not a priority for them.
[normal]2.1.2
[normal]              
[normal]Calling a scheme a “Competent Persons Scheme” and expecting the public to become aware of it, when a lot of electrician’s are not even sure what it means, is just not going to work.
[normal] A single “Electric Safe” register has a 
[normal]much higher chance of successful public recognition.
[normal]2.1.3
[normal]              
[normal]The phrase “certain domestic electrical works” is a big part of the 
[normal]problem. 
[normal]Successive versions of Part P hav
[normal]e been 
[normal]too complicated
[normal] in their attempts to de
[normal]fine their scope. M
[normal]any electrician’s would have difficulty defining what type of electrical work is or is not notifiable and, it is a fact of life that the more complicated you make something
[normal] the less likely it is to be 
[normal]understood and 
[normal]adhered to. Less 
[normal]is o
[normal]ften 
[normal]more and, I believe the entire Part P document could (should) be replaced by the following single sentence:-
[normal]All [bold](domestic?) [bold]electrical installation work, other than “like for like” replacement of [bold] [bold]components[bold] where basic electrical safety has been confirmed[bold], must  be notified[bold] to the local authority.”[bold]2.1.4 
[normal]              
[normal]The Committee 
[normal]has rightly 
[normal]criticized the witnesses for duplication of schemes but 
[normal]it is 
[normal]worth noting that the above sentence, added to the already respecte
[normal]d (by electrician’s) BS7671 Requirements for Electrical Installation, would render Part P superfluous.
[normal] It often seems the case that new policies and procedures are introduced without considering that relatively minor changes to existing documents may provi
[normal]de a much simpler
[normal], cheaper and, more importantly, 
[normal]effective solution.
[normal]2.1.5
[normal]              
[normal]Whilst it is accepted that certain a
[normal]reas of electrical work present
[normal] a higher risk than 
[normal]others, a fundamental error, such as reverse
[normal]d
[normal] polarity at a socket outlet, has
[normal] the 
[normal]capacity 
[normal]to cause injury wherever it is installed, not just so-called “special locations.”
[normal]2.2[bold].0[bold]              [bold]the extent to which those carrying out electrical works are adequately trained to [bold]  [bold]meet the requirements of the Building Regulations and the extent to which all those working for a company are brought up to the same level of skills; [bold]2.2
[normal].1
[normal]              
[normal]Broadly speaking, electrical installation work is currently being carried out by two “classes” of p
[normal]erson, electricians and non-e
[normal]lectricians.
[normal]2.2
[normal].2
[normal]              
[normal]E
[normal]lectricians are very well-qualified, self-motivated and, to a large extent self-monitored individuals who are trained to a high standard (some would say too high for domestic work only), who are required to achieve NVQ Level III 
[normal]before they are fully recog
[normal]niz
[normal]ed by the main 
[normal]voluntary 
[normal]registration bodies.
[normal]2.2.3
[normal]              
[normal]Non-electricians, such as kitchen fitters, plumbers and heating engineers are a problem. Most will admit to you that the reason they became plumbers or whatever, rather than electricians, was because o
[normal]f the very fact that they “don’t really understand electricity.” 
[normal]2.2.4
[normal]              
[normal]Electrical work is problematic because, particularly for domestic work, the actual skill level required to run and terminate a cable is relatively low, particularly for someone with as
[normal]sociated skills, like a plumber. However, it demands a much higher level of skills, knowledge and experience to ensure that any additions or alterations are car
[normal]ried out safely, and properly tested and commissioned. 
[normal]2.2.5
[normal]              
[normal]I do not believe that a 5 day defi
[normal]ned scope Part P course will give a person the required competence level to issue them with a Part P registration card which just further legitimizes their position as modifiers of electrical circuits.
[normal]2.2.6
[normal]              
[normal]In short, I believe that the gap between these t
[normal]wo levels of accreditation is far too wide. This is partly due to the electrical industry’s insistence on every electrician gaining a full level III qualification, leaving the wa
[normal]y open for 
[normal]“Part P”
[normal] domestic installers who are allowed to alter circuits one at a time but not all at once! This is very reminiscent of the “trigger’s broom”
[normal] 
[normal]sketch in On
[normal]ly Fools and H
[normal]orses!
[normal]2.2.7
[normal]              
[normal]In my opinion, there is an urgent need for 3 type
[normal]s
[normal] of person authoriz
[normal]ed to ca
[normal]rry out electrical work as follows:-
[normal]a.
[normal] full
[normal] NVQ LIII q
[normal]ualif
[normal]i
[normal]ed and registered
[normal] Industrial, Commercial and Domestic
[normal] 
[normal]   
[normal]Electrician.
[normal]b.  
[normal]An NVQ LII qualified and registered Domestic Electrician
[normal]2.3.0[bold]              [bold]the extent to which those carrying out electrical works, to which the Building Regulations apply, review or have their work reviewed to ensure that it m[bold]eets the requirements of the Regulations;[bold]2.3.1
[normal]              
[normal]It is the policy
[normal] of most of the Registration and trade bodies to carry out annual assessments of their registered or member enterprises. This usually involves the inspection of one or two installations that have been completed by the enterprise. It is my belief that, in m
[normal]ost cases, this level of monitoring is adequate and it is difficult to suggest other means by which this may be 
[normal]effectively carried out.
[normal] 
[normal]2.4.0[bold]              [bold]the adequacy of the review of electrical works carried out by Competent Persons;[bold]2.4.1
[normal]              
[normal]Lessons should be learnt
[normal] here from the “Gas Safe” scheme, whereby it was the enterprise that needed to be registered with no requirement for the individual to demonstrate competence. Experience has shown that, for a large number of companies, on-site assessment or monitoring of e
[normal]mployees is just not practical due to commercial pressures and lack of trained assessors. This is still a fundamental flaw with NVQ qualifications and the reason large numbers of “electricians” possess only a technical certificate and not an NVQ, preventin
[normal]g them from registering with bodies such as the JIB.
[normal]2.4.2
[normal]              
[normal]I believe that a compulsory system of registration via a single body with training and certification provided by competitive suppliers allied to truly “standardized” standards would 
[normal]achieve a level
[normal] of confidence in the competence of persons carrying out electrical work.
[normal]2
[normal].4
[normal].3
[normal]              
[normal]Successive governments seem to have been reluctant to implement this for the electrical industry
[normal] but 5 year assessment of individuals need not be any 
[normal]more onerous than annual a
[normal]ssessment of enterprises.
[normal]2.5.0[bold]              [bold]the effect of competition between accreditation bodies, and the two separate registers of electricians, on the standards of review of domestic electrical work;[bold] [bold]2.5.1
[normal]              
[normal]It was abundantly clear from the video of the meeting 
[normal]that entrusting a registration scheme to competing bodies is not the way forward. Each body 
[normal]relies on being slightly different from its competitors in order to secure an advantage over the other. This is not the right atmosphere in which to develop common 
[normal]standards, particularly where safety is concerned.
[normal]2.5.2
[normal]              
[normal]I have watched with interest over many years how bodies which claim to be maintaining standards are actually responsible for distorting them or at least “muddying the waters.” Electrical test certifi
[normal]cates are a case in point. BS7671 provides model forms for certification of ele
[normal]ctrical installations but, most bodies 
[normal]and trade association
[normal]s have
[normal] produced their own version of the form. This is very confusing when encouraging people to “conform to the stan
[normal]dards” when the very bodies responsible for policing them encourage the use of non-standard documents.
[normal]2
[normal].
[normal]5.3
[normal]              
[normal]The chairman was right, the only way to cut through the vested interests and enforce standardization is to impose a statutory registration body.
[normal]2.6.0[bold] [bold]              [bold]the adequacy of the supervision by DCLG of the accreditation schemes. [bold]2.6.
[normal]1
[normal]              
[normal]I am 
[normal]unaware of the procedures DCLG have
[normal] implemented to 
[normal]supervise 
[normal]thes
[normal]e 
[normal]schemes and am therefore unable to comment.
[normal] 
[normal]2.6.2
[normal]              
[normal]However, I do get the feeling that, in all walks of life, those who strive to get things right are being made to jump through more and more hoops to prove they are doing it right in the first place. A little more supervision and prosecution of the “offende
[normal]rs” is what’s actually required – but this is difficult.

[normal] 
[normal]BIBLIOGRAPHY
[normal]My name is Nigel Harman and the opinions expressed above are entirely personal.
[normal]I have worked in the electrical industry since 1975 as an electrical engineer, college lecturer, 
[normal]trainer and assessor of individuals and inspector of installations
[normal] in electrical installation and renewable technologies.
[normal]I am submitting this report because I believe that the electrical industry and it’s
[normal] customers are not being well served by the plethora of qualifications and “schemes” which are simply confusing everybody and having no real impact on unauthorised or sub-standard work.
