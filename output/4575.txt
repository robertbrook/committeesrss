[[[The roles of the Secretary of State and local authorities]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;‘Local authorities should embrace a new role in education, not as providers of schools or school improvement services, but as champions for children.  This would mean articulating a local and aspirational vision for education.  As champions for children, the local authority would capture local knowledge and intelligence by undertaking some scrutiny of education provision to ensure that it is meeting the needs and interests of young people in the area.’&#xa0;
