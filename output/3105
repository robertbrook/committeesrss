defaultENRC welcomes the opportunity to make a submission to the BIS Select Committee inquiry into the Extractive Industries Sector.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe UK has relatively modest domestic extractive industries operations and therefore mainly derives its reputation in the extractive industries sector by marketing itself as a worldwide centre for the advice and
default 
defaultfinancing for extractive industries companies.  This is illustrated by the number of leading international mining companies listing on the London Stock Exchange such as Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton, Anglo American, ENRC,
default 
defaultKazakhmys and Glencore Xstrata.  London earns significant income from these foreign companies and from the domestic employment that they generate in the UK.  Their presence is of net financial benefit to the UK.
default&#xa0;
defaultLondon generates tax receipts by providing access to significant capital for growth, as well as the ability to raise finance for further development. Nearly a quarter of global equity financing value for the mining sector was raised in London over the last five years.
default&#xa0;
defaultLondon-listed companies are also well placed to develop a broad shareholder base which also understands the Eurasian region and Africa, both core areas of operation for ENRC.
default&#xa0;
defaultNB:  In June of this yea
defaultr the terms of an offer to buy 
defaultENRC were announced by Eurasian Resources Group B.V., a consortium comprised of the Group’s founding shareholders and the Government of the Republic of
default 
defaultKazakhstan. The offer process is ongoing, though as of 26 September 2013 95.99% of shareholders have accepted, and it is the intention of the Consortium to privatise the business and delist from the London Stock Exchange.
default&#xa0;
defaultBackground to ENRCdefault&#xa0;
defaultENRC is a leading diversified natural resources group, performing integrated mining, processing, energy, logistics and marketing operations.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe operations comprise: the mining and processing of chrome, manganese and iron ore; the smelting of ferroalloys; the production of iron ore concentrate and pellet; the mining and processing of bauxite for the
default 
defaultextraction of alumina and the production of aluminium; the production of copper and cobalt; coal extraction and electricity generation; and the transportation and sales of the Group’s products.
defaultThe Group’s production assets are largely located in the Republic of Kazakhstan; other assets, notably the Other Non-ferrous Division, are mainly located in Africa; the Group also has iron ore assets in Brazil. In
default 
default2012 the Group's entities employed on average 78,484 (2011: 77,441) people. The Group currently sells the majority of its products to Russia, China, Japan, Western Europe and the United States.
defaultENRC has six operating Divisions: Ferroalloys, Iron Ore, Alumina and Aluminium, Other Non-ferrous, Energy and Logistics. ENRC is a UK company with its registered office in London, where the PLC’s administrative
default 
defaultfunctions are based. ENRC's shares are quoted on the London Stock Exchange and the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange.
defaultENRC pays tax in the UK and during its life as a listed company, has paid several hundreds of millions (£) in fees to London based advisors.  It employs 144 staff in the UK and many more can list ENRC on their resumes as they deploy their talents elsewhere in the sector.
default&#xa0;
defaultENRC regulatory compliance and corporate governancedefault&#xa0;
defaultIn common with all London-listed businesses, ENRC is required to take its responsibility under the UK Corporate Governance Code seriously.  As an indication, the cost of complying with the conditions for its London listing exceeded £200m.
default&#xa0;
defaultSurrounding the IPO it became clear that the Group would need to introduce a whistle blowing scheme and be seen to make this work – this was introduced in 2010. The Group actively encouraged submissions and committed significant resources to investigation and resolution of any issues - much of the press coverage in recent years have arisen from the transparency of this scheme, the vast majority of complaints having been satisfactorily resolved within the Group.
default&#xa0;
defaultFor a business which has listed relatively recently, ENRC also made considerable progress regarding Corporate Social Responsibility.  In 2012, ENRC published its first standalone sustainability report, which was independently assured by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. No other company from Kazakh origins has yet produced such a report.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis being said, it is the Group’s view that although fast, its evolution from a private, Kazakh-based company to the scrutiny appropriate for a FTSE 100 company was not fast or flexible enough to prevent the natural adjustment being played out in an unsympathetic way among the London commentariat.
defaultThe Committee asks whether this type of response presents wider reputational risk for the UK and we would agree that it has the potential to do so – foreign companies will observe the lengths that ENRC has gone to in order to comply and the significant financial investment that has been made and then observe how the company has been scrutinised.
defaultThe Committee asks whether increased regulation will deter future foreign listings.  We respectfully suggest that if London wishes to maintain a prominent role in attracting future London listings by foreign companies,
default 
defaultit should consider introducing a quarantine period (similar to the role played by AIM) to allow a company to evolve with a degree of reputational protection.  ENRC would be happy to work with the committee to develop this idea.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe UK Skills Basedefault&#xa0;
defaultThe Committee asks whether the UK has the requisite skills base to serve the sector in the future, citing shale gas as an example.  ENRC is predominantly a mining company and b
defaultelieves that this is a question of extractive industry energy sub-sector strength.  The UK has a vibrant energy sector and there is no reason why it does not have the requisite advisor pool to serve such companies in the future.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is important, in particular for extractive industry companies seeking to list in London, that the correct balance is struck. The risk is that effective regulation and oversight of international extractive operations
default 
defaultcan become overbearing and counterproductive. We must recognise that the world’s natural resources are no longer found within developed countries, which typically have more established laws and protocols, but are
default 
defaultincreasingly found in developing countries. In order to meet the world’s growing demand for essential energy and materials, companies are operating in jurisdictions where the regulatory and business environment are very different from that found in the UK.
default&#xa0;
defaultENRC has incurred significant costs ensuring that it continued to meet these standards, whilst operating in more challenging markets. We are not proposing that extractive industries be excused or exempted from adhering to these standards, but that time is allowed to improve governance standards within operations located in these frontier markets. This way the cost to extractive companies can be incurred over time, and a balance is struck between expense, delivering returns to shareholders and improving governance standards.
default&#xa0;
defaultENRC will assist the committee as much as it can with its inquiries and is particularly keen to engage in dialogue on areas within the committee's ambit, such as to how the current UK business environment might be improved.  However, as the committee will know, the company is presently the subject of a formal SFO criminal investigation and involved in other, civil, proceedings. In the circumstances, there are certain factual areas of legal sensitivity, in particular relating to historic compliance / conduct issues, which necessarily limit the scope of information the company and its representatives can provide the committee. While some of these issues have been the subject of unfortunate press speculation, they ought not to be of central relevance to the inquiry. The company will be grateful to the committee for respecting its position in this regard.
