defaultRMP 04default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultWritten evidence submitted by the National Federation of SubPostmasterdefaultsdefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default1. Executive summarydefault&#xa0;
default1.1 
defaultSubpostmasters provide vital access to and 
defaultadvice and information on Royal Mail services to the public and small business.
default&#xa0;
default1.2 
defaultThe separation of Post Office Ltd (POL) and Royal Mail is the first known example in the world of a national mail operator being separated from its retail arm.
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default The NF
defaultSP warned the government that th
defaulte success of this
default separation 
defaultwas predicated upon substantial income from additional government work at post offices.
default 
default&#xa0;
default1.4 The government has completely failed to deliver on its pledge to make more central and local governme
defaultnt services available at post offices.
default&#xa0;
default1.5 Instead, post offices are highly and increasingly dependent on income from Royal Mail services for their survival.
default&#xa0;
default1.6 Since separation, subpostmasters are already experiencing a more aggressive attitude from Ro
defaultyal Mail towards post offices.
default&#xa0;
default1.7 The NFSP fears that a privatised Royal Mail will seek to 
defaultfurther 
defaultreduce costs and increase profits by renegotiating its business agreement with POL.
default&#xa0;
default1.8 POL and the post office network will be unable to survive 
defaultindependently from Royal Mail Group
default. The
default NFSP is 
defaulttherefore 
defaultcalling for the
default government to halt the privatis
defaultation of Royal Mail; and to retain an ongoing stake in the company to defend the interests of our post offices.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2. Introduction default&#xa0;default2.1 The National Federation of SubPostmasters (NFSP) is the membership organisation which represents the 
defaultUK
default’s subpostmasters. Subpostmasters are independent business people who act as agents to 
defaultPOL 
defaultand run sub post offices, which make up 97% of the nationa
defaultl post office network. 
default&#xa0;
default2.2 This is our written submission to the House of Commons Business, Innovation and Skills Committee’s inquiry on Royal Mail privatisation.
default&#xa0;
default2.3 While the areas of interest and concern on this subject are many and varied, space con
defaultstraints mean that this submission will focus primarily on the main area of interest to the NFSP – the impact on post offices of Royal Mail privatisation.   
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3. Relationship between post offices and Royal Maildefault&#xa0;default3.1 Post offices and Royal Mail have been 
defaultclosely linked throughout the Post Office’s 370 year history. The two services are heavily inter-dependent, and in the public mind are often indistinguishable.
default&#xa0;
default3.2 Until their separation in April 2012, 
defaultPOL 
defaultand Royal Mail were both independent, government-
defaultowned companies within Royal Mail Group. 
default&#xa0;
default3.3. 
defaultPost offices are the ‘shop front’ for Royal Mail, providing access to mail services and playing a crucial role in the delivery of the universal 
defaultpostal 
defaultservice. In total 90 different Royal Mail products, stamp
defaults and services are available at post offices
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.4 
defaultSubpostmasters provide an unrivalled specialisation in mail services, 
defaultoffering 
defaultadvice and information to customers as well as access to Royal Mail services. They are paid varying rates for a range of tra
defaultnsactions which include postage sales and handling pre-paid mail. 
default&#xa0;
default3.5 
defaultIn additional to mail, government, financial and other services, the 
defaultUK
default’s post offices provide a well-documented social and economic service to their customers and local communities. T
defaulthe former postal services regulator Postcomm calculated this social value at up to £10bn and conclu
defaultded that post offices provide “
defaulta major social net benefit to the 
defaultUK
default population.”
default 
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4. Separation of POL and Royal Maildefault&#xa0;default4.1 
defaultThe government announced its 
defaultintention to separate POL and Royal Mail in 2010. POL was to remain in public ownership
default,
default with the possibility of 
defaultlater 
defaultbeing transferred to mutual ownership; while Royal Mail was to be privatised. 
default&#xa0;
default4.2 
defaultThe proposals became law with the passing of the Post
defaultal Services Act in 2011. This is the first known example in the world of a national mail operator being separated from its retail arm.
default&#xa0;
default4.3 The two separate companies currently operate under Royal Mail Holdings plc, although we understand that this remaini
defaultng link 
defaultis due to be 
defaultterminated upon the privatis
defaultation of Royal Mail
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.4 
defaultThe NFSP accepted these changes on the explicit understanding that POL and the 
defaultUK
default’s post offices would have a secure future outside of Royal Mail Group. This would be achieved through a combination of a robust, 
defaultlong-term
default business agreement between POL and Royal Mail; and significant new income through government and financial services.
default&#xa0;
default4.5 
defaultWhile accepting these changes, the NFSP warned the government’s approach was without international precedent and contained a high degree of risk. We also made clear that substantial income from additional government work was an essential pre-requisit
defaulte 
defaultfor the Post Office to be able to 
defaultsurvive as an independent entity outside of Royal Mail Group.
default 
default5. Post offices and mail services default&#xa0;default5.1 
defaultIn its 2010 strategy paper on the Post Office, the government claims that falling mail volumes mean that postal ser
defaultvices “will not be a growth area for the Post Office”; while government and financial services offer “real growth potential”
default. However, these assumptions are belied by the reality experienced by post offices.
default&#xa0;
default5.2 
defaultWhile income for post offices from government and financial services remains low (see section 
default8
default), NFSP research shows that post offices are highly reliant on mail services. Mail transactions are overwhelmingly the single biggest contributor to subpostmaste
defaultrs’ income, responsible on average for a third of all pay
default. 
defaultFor some post offices the proportion of income from mails services can be considerably higher.
default&#xa0;
default5.3 
defaultThis reliance is increasing, with a survey in 2009 showing that mail transactions brought in 28%
default of subpostmasters’ pay.
default 
default&#xa0;
default5.4 
defaultIn 2012-13, mail revenue brought in £409m to POL, a 4.3% increase on the previous year and accounting for 33% of all POL revenue.
default 
default&#xa0;
default5.5 
defaultPOL estimates that mail transactions account for more than half of all customer visits 
defaultto post offices.
default 
default&#xa0;
default5.6 
defaultIn addition to transaction-related income, a payment from Royal Mail allows POL to pay subpostmasters approximately £100m a year for providing 
defaultRoyal Mail with
default bricks and mortar access points. This pay is received by subpostmasters with traditional Post Office contracts via the fixed (or ‘core tier’) element of their pay. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default6. Threats to post offices from Royal Mail defaultprivatizationdefault&#xa0;default6.1 
defaultA 10-year Inter-Business Ag
defaultreement (IBA) was signed between POL and Royal Mail in January 2012, shortly before the separation of the two companies. This was intended to ensure that POL would remain Royal Mail’s exclusive retail outlet
default;
default and
default that
default the public and business
defaultes
default 
defaultc
defaultould 
defaultcontinue to access Royal Mail services at post offices for the next decade.
default&#xa0;
default6.2 
defaultWhile the NFSP welcomed the IBA, we understand that the contract contains break-points at five and eight years, 
defaultwhen 
defaultarrangements can be reviewed. 
default&#xa0;
default6.3 
defaultThe Chief Executive of
default Royal Mail may claim it is “unthinkable”
default that POL and Royal Mail won’t have an ongoing relationship; but this provides no reassurance on payment rates for or exclusivity of Royal Mail services at post offices.
default&#xa0;
default6.4 
defaultThe NFSP has very real concerns that th
defaulte new owners of a privatised Royal Mail will seek to dilute
default, renegotiate
default or tear up the agreement in pursuit of reduced costs and increased profit. This would have a highly detrimental impact on the finances both of POL and of individual post offices. 
default&#xa0;
default6.
default5 
defaultIn the year since 
defaultthe 
defaultseparation of the two business
defaultes
default, but with Royal Mail still in government ownership, subpostmasters have already experienced a more aggressive attitude from Royal Mail towards post offices. We understand that price increases for par
defaultcels introduced by Royal Mail on 2 April 
default2013 
defaulthave proved to be 
defaultprofitable 
defaultto 
defaultRoyal Mail
default; but have cost POL 
default£10m in revenue
default, and have lost individual post offices many vital mail customers and thousands of pounds each in income. 
default&#xa0;
default6.6 
defaultThe NFSP believes 
defaultthat were Royal Mail and POL still integrated within Royal Mail Group, outcomes such as these would have been addressed before any decision was reached, with any adverse impact on post offices being a full and equal consideration in any final decision.
default&#xa0;
default6.
default7 
defaultIn addition, subpostmasters are reporting a
defaultn increased incidence 
defaultof ‘poaching’, with Royal Mail approaching business customers and offering incentives for them to transact directly with Royal Mail rather than through local post offices. 
default&#xa0;
default6.8 
defaultFurthermore
default, several commentators have cited the likelihood of a privatised Royal Mail seeking to amend the terms of the Universal Service Obligation which it is required to meet, to help reduce costs and increase profits. This could include the removal of the First 
defaultClass mail service and replacing First and Second Class with a two-day service; reducing the quality of service target for First Class mail; or reducing the number of collection and delivery days from the existing six day service. 
default&#xa0;
default6.9 
defaultIn addition to wide
defaultspread concerns about the impact any such changes would have on business and residential customers, the NFSP has also expressed strong concerns about the potentially damaging impact which such changes would have on use of mail services and therefore on rev
defaultenue for post offices
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default7. Mailwork post officesdefault&#xa0;default7.1 
defaultAround 800 post offices also provide premises, facilities and supervision for Royal Mail delivery staff. Subpostmasters running these ‘mailwork’ post offices, which are overwhelmingly located in rural areas, are particularly reliant on income from Royal Ma
defaultil to 
defaultsustain 
defaulttheir businesses. These subpostmasters receive payments related to the number of postmen and women they supervise. This pay is typically around 25% of a mailwork office’s total 
defaultp
defaultost 
defaulto
defaultffice income. The NFSP is concerned that a privatised Royal
default Mail may wish to review these arrangements, and renegotiate or terminate them in the name of cost savings, resulting in the probabl
defaulte
default closure of the
defaultse
default post offices. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default8. Government and financial services at post officesdefault&#xa0;default8.1 
defaultTo achieve a full picture of th
defaulte threat facing the 
defaultUK
default’s post offices as a result of Royal Mail privatisation, post offices’ growing dependence on mail services must be placed in the wider context of the complete failure of other services to generate additional income for post offices; a
defaultnd the escalating crisis in income which subpostmasters face.
default&#xa0;
default8.2 
defaultIn 2010 the government announced plans to use post offices as the ‘front office for government’
default,
default offering 
defaultthe public 
defaultface-to-face 
defaultaccess 
defaultto a full range of central and local government iden
defaulttity, information
default and p
defaultayment services.
default8.3 
defaultThe NFSP fully supports the concept of creating a ‘front office for government’ at post offices. We believe that making far more central and local government services available at post offices will provide cost s
defaultavings for government; improve access for customers; and 
defaultdeliver 
defaultvital new income for post offices. As detailed in section 
default4
default of this response, we made clear that the realisation of these proposals was an essential pre-requisite to a successful separation o
defaultf POL and Royal Mail.
default&#xa0;
default8.4 
defaultHowever, the government has failed to deliver on its pledge. POL income from government services h
defaultas collapsed from £576m in 2004-
default05
default to 
defaultwhat POL claims to be 
default£164m in 2012-13
default.
default 
defaultHowever, the NFSP believes that the £164m includes 
defaultincome from the Post Office card account, which in 2004-05 was counted as financial services revenue rather than government services revenue. If the same criteria were employed for the 2012-13 accounts as were used in 2004-05, income from government servic
defaultes is likely to be as low as £120m.
default&#xa0;
default8.5 
defaultNo new major government services have been awarded to post offices since May 2010. The few new services which have been introduced are one-off transactions 
defaultavailable only in a small number of post offices.
default&#xa0;
default8.6 
defaultNFS
defaultP research
default 
defaultshows that the overwhelming majority of 
defaultUK
default subpostmasters are making no income at all from these services: 
default*For those with any earnings 
default&#xa0;
default8.7 
defaultMeanwhile, other government services – benefit cheques (or ‘Green Giros’) and National Savings &amp; Investments products – have recently been withdrawn from post offices.
default&#xa0;
default8.8 
defaultPOL was re-awarded the contract for DVLA service
defaults in November 2012 – but as a result of the procurement process, there has been a very significant drop in the income the Post Office receives from the DVLA. Subpostmasters are now earning around 50% of the previous rate 
default(
defaulti.e. 
defaultpayments detailed in 
default8.6
default above)
default 
defaultfor DVLA transactions. 
default&#xa0;
default8.9 
defaultFurthermore, progress on offering a comprehensive range of local authority services through post offices has also been very limited.
default&#xa0;
default8.10 
defaultThis failure comes despite the fact that the public wants to use these services 
defaultat post offices. Research shows that 89% of people say it is important there is an option 
defaultof face-to-face access to a full range of government services; 73% say post offices are the most appropriate type of premises for offering this.
default 
default&#xa0;
default8.11 
defaultThe governmen
defaultt has stated that alongside government services, financial services are a major area where the Post Office can increase its income.
default 
default&#xa0;
default8.12 
defaultPOL has provided a range of Post Office-branded financial services products in partnership with the Bank of Ireland 
defaultsince 2004. But the Bank of Ireland financial services products - including vehicle insurance, life assurance and credit cards – are not providing any revenue to the vast majority of subpostmasters
default.
default&#xa0;
default8.13 
defaultRecent NFSP research
default shows that across the 
defaultUK
default, 
defaultno 
defaultmonthly income at all 
defaultwas earned by:
default&#xa0;
default8.14 
defaultPOL remains a heavily loss-making company. Its operating profit of £94m in 2012-13 is only achieved through a £210m subsidy payment by the government; its reported £33m increase in profit on the previous year achieved through a direct combination of a
default £30m increase in the government subsidy and a reduction of £5m in subpostmasters’ remuneration.
default 
default&#xa0;
default8.15 
defaultAs a result, another of the government’s key objectives for separating POL and Royal Mail - the mutualisation of POL - now looks increasingly unlikely to be achieved. It is widely agreed that any mutualisation is predicated upon POL being 
defaultfinancially susta
defaultinable
default. Achieving this goal looks less likely then ever; and Royal Mail privatisation, and the attendant threat of a renegotiation of Royal Mail’s business relationship with POL, can only serve to exacerbate this already bleak outlook.  
default&#xa0;
default8.16 
defaultThe failure 
defaultof new services, coupled with the loss of existing services; cuts to pay; rapidly rising operating costs; and increased competition from digital communication channels, have resulted in a collapse in subpostmasters’ incomes. 
default&#xa0;
default8.17 
defaultNFSP research
default shows tha
defaultt:
default&#xa0;
default8.18 
defaultThis situation is not sustainable. In view of the complete failure 
defaultto deliver 
defaultnew services 
defaultand new 
defaultincome 
defaultto 
defaultpost offices, the NFSP is concerned that Royal Mail 
defaultprivatisation, and the changes to Royal Mail’s business relationship with post offices which co
defaultuld ensue, will make an already dire situation even worse. 
default&#xa0;
default8.19 
defaultThis is an issue of pressing significance for the government as when subpostmasters no longer earn enough to run their businesses, post offices close.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default9 defaultConclusionsdefault&#xa0;default9.1 
defaultThe government has co
defaultmpletely failed to deliver a secure future to POL and to post offices outside of Royal Mail Group. Government and financial services are not yielding any significant income for subpostmasters, who in turn are struggling to make a living from their post off
defaultices. Post Office mutualisation is increasingly less likely to be achieved.
default&#xa0;
default9.2 
defaultAs a result, the NFSP believes that the government must halt the sale of Royal Mail, at least until it can be unequivocally demonstrated that POL and the 
defaultUK
default’s post offices hav
defaulte a viable and sustainable future outside of Royal Mail Group. 
defaultIf this cannot be achieved, POL should be reintegrated into Royal Mail Group.
default&#xa0;
default9.3 
defaultWe also believe that the government must retain an ongoing stake in Royal Mail. This would ensure that the com
defaultpany meets its obligations to the nation as an essential part of the 
defaultUK
default’s national infrastructure and as a key service provider
default. In addition, 
defaultwith regard to the post office network, an ongoing government stake in Royal Mail would help ensure that post offi
defaultces’ interests remain reflected and represented within Royal Mail’s decision-making
default;
default and that the business agreement 
defaultbetween the two companies is policed and where necessary defended.
default  
default&#xa0;
default9.4 
defaultThe NFSP’s opposition to the Royal Mail sale is not ideological; but based on grave concerns about the likely impact on our post offices. 
defaultMany post offices are already operating on the very edge of viability and cannot sustain any further loss of services 
defaultor reductions in pay. 
default&#xa0;
default9.
default5
default 
defaultUnless the government is willing to reconsider its position on Royal Mail, it is clear that POL as an independent company; the 
defaultUK
default’s post offices; and the millions of people and small businesses who rely on them, all face a highl
defaulty uncertain future.
