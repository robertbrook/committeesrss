&#xa0;Written evidence from Susan Hedley (LTD0006)My concerns are:-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Do local bodies (including local authorities, local enterprise partnerships, passenger transport executives, integrated transport authorities and local transport boards) have the capacity to assess, prioritise and deliver local transport schemes? What would the optimum delivery body look like?-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; What impact will the devolution in 2015 of funding to Local Transport Bodies and the introduction of the Single Local Growth Fund have?-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[.]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;Dear Cllrs Davey, Jackson, and Reid,As promised in my online response to the Combined Authority local consultation, please find attached further details.I am not completely negative about this, but I am extremely concerned that the rural communities of Northumberland and County Durham will have no voice, particularly with regard to public transport, and also because we have already ended up in a unitary county authority without residents being able to vote on it.Our democratic powers seem to be moving further and further away from us.In particular, of the two existing and three proposed combined authorities, 

[[[Northumberland and County Durham would be the first 2 predominantly]]]

[[[ rural authorities]]] to enter into such an arrangement. 

[[[I therefore think that there should be two representatives for Northumberland, one for the 50% of the population who live in the southeast and one for the 50% of the population who live in the rural co]]]

[[[mmunities.]]] Maybe there should be the same arrangement for rural County Durham as well, so that there would at least be some rural voice, even if it was still without any power compared to all of the other urban representatives.

[[[At the very least, there sho]]]

[[[uld be an effective trial period and means of opting out for the rural areas]]] of Northumberland and County Durham if this arrangement is found not to be working for them. Before this proposal is allowed to proceed any further there should also be a

[[[Combined Authority Local Consultation,]]]

[[[o]]]the overall economic conditions Yes

[[[Please tell us why]]]A)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; IT WOULD NOT PROVIDE EFFECTIVE REPRESENTATION AND SCRUTINY FOR THE NEEDS OF RURAL COMMUNITIES.B)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE HAVE HAD A PROPER CHANCE TO FIND OUT ABOUT THE CONSULTATION AND RESPOND, THOUGH MANY WOULD PROBABLY HAVE VERY STRONG OPINIONS IF THEY KNEW ABOUT IT.&#xa0;

[[[A)]]]In the proposed form, if this doesn't work, we would not have the money for the legal process to reverse it.  We should be able to have some sort of trial period before committing.  In particular, of the two existing and three proposed combined authorities, 

[[[Northumberland and County Durham would be the first 2 predominantly rural authorities]]] to enter into such an arrangement.  It is already difficult for rural voices to be heard in these counties, because rural people without decent computer services and broadband, and with little or no public transport access to public meetings and libraries, cannot take an equal part in consultations or effectively observe what is being decided in their name.  Given that five out of the seven authorities proposed for the North East leadership board are urban, and if the  Leader of Northumberland County Council is from the urban area of the county, as is currently and has previously very often been the case, there  would be 

[[[no voice speaking up for the communities in the ]]]

[[[97% of the county which is classed as rural, and the 50 % of the population ]]]

[[[who live]]] 

[[[there, ]]]rather than in the 3% of urban land found in the south east of the county [N.C.C. website, key statistics about Northumberland].&#xa0;Having worked for almost ten years in Morpeth, the site of County Hall and on the boundary between the rural southeast and the rest of Northumberland, it has become obvious to me that despite its situation, most people in Morpeth are not familiar with the location of most of the villages in the rural areas  which lie beyond three or four miles north and west of the town, and they certainly have little or no idea about the lives and work of the people who live there, or what services they may or may not have left to them.  If this is the case in Morpeth, on the edge of the rural area, there is little chance that anyone based in the south east of the county, and from that culture, has any real appreciation of the nature and needs of rural communities, even if they have the best intentions, and have been dealing with council business for the whole of their working lives.When the Unitary Authority was created in Northumberland, there was no official poll, and despite all of the unofficial polls appearing to show that about 90% of Northumberland residents objected to a Unitary Authority, those who had the power to do so forced it through anyway against the wishes of most residents. Now, for certain issues, the majority of those on the North East Leadership Board who are shaping crucial policies in our name are going to be impossibly remote should we wish to contact them or observe what is being done in our name.  At present, if public transport allows, I can get to County Hall to observe a Policy Board or full Council meeting. It is almost certain that it will be too time consuming and expensive for me to go to observe a North East Leadership Board meeting, even if I was allowed to, given that a high proportion of the matters being discussed under the headings of economic development and regeneration and transport are likely to be commercially sensitive.  It is likely to be remote even from my own County Councillor.  It is unlikely that the representatives of e.g. Sunderland and Newcastle could have any useful insight into the needs of e.g. Berwick-upon-Tweed and the north of Northumberland, which would most probably benefit from making better connections with Scotland rather than areas south of the Tyne anyway.

[[[There is not enough detail in the current consultation for us to be able to giv]]]

[[[e a properly informed response]]], and as usual, next to no-one who I have spoken to in the last week has any idea that this is happening, although they do have strong views about it when asked.  Though the consultation is on the front page of the Northumberland County Council website, it only says consultation and does not say what it is about until people actually go into it. Though many would be likely to have strong feelings about it, they are not likely to go into it unless they are already in the know.  It does not appear in the alerts at the top of the County Council home page, although more parochial consultations have appeared there in recent weeks, so unless people have time to investigate, they might well think that the consultation is about one of these parochial issues.  I know from speaking to people that a significant proportion are cancelling papers such as the Morpeth Herald and the Northumberland Gazette because they are looking for any ways to enable  their income to continue to cover their needs, so fewer people would be able to find out about the consultation from these sources.  

[[[We therefore need an effective consultation so that people have had a ]]]

[[[proper]]]

[[[ chance to find out about it and respond.]]]&#xa0;

[[[Please tell us why]]]See answer 2, section A above.  At the very least, there should be an effective trial period and means of opting out for the rural areas of Northumberland and County Durham if this arrangement is found not to be working for them, because 

[[[Northumberland and County Durham would be the first 2 predominantly rural authorities]]] to enter into a combined authority, so there are no precedents for this particular situation – it would be a learning experience, particularly because all of the other authorities are urban.  After all, 50% of the population of Northumberland is rural, and they have as much call to have their particular needs provided for as those of the urban population are, but if representation is constituted as it is proposed at present, the likelihood is that they would have no true and accurate representation at all.&#xa0;

[[[Please tell us w]]]

[[[hy]]]

[[[I do not agree]]] that only the commissioning and procurement of subsidised bus services should be devolved to Northumberland County Council. I think that 

[[[all ]]]public transport services other than rail should be devolved to Northumberland and Durham County Councils, because the other authorities will have absolutely no understanding of or interest in rural transport issues, and these are essential for the viability of the lives of rural inhabitants and their communities.I think that there should be some ring fencing of the interests of tourism in those counties for the same reasons, and because tourism is the basis for such a large part of the economy of those counties.  It would be disastrous for them if other initiatives were to blight our chances of attracting tourists.Otherwise, I agree with a more co-ordinated approach for skills and economy.&#xa0;Resident(Business representativeVoluntary and community representativeLocal authority/ partner organisation representativeOther interested party)&#xa0;
