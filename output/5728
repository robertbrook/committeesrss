defaultQ59 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Good afternoon.  A very special, warm welcome to Professor 
defaultBeddington
default for agreeing to participate in our Inquiry on Food Security this afternoon.  A little bit of housekeeping: we may have to break for one vote, so we will come back as quickly as we can.  Looking at your excellent Foresight Report on the 
default‘
defaultFuture of Food and Farming
default’
default, it was very comprehensive.  What would you draw as the main implications from the findings for food production systems in the 
defaultUK
default? 
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: 
defaultG
defaultood afternoon everyone, 
defaultand 
defaultthank you Chair.  It is slightly strange, I should say
default; 
defaultthe last few times I have been in front of Committees I have had half a dozen officials looking after me and carrying my coat and giving me briefings, and so on.  I will not say I feel entirely naked, but I feel a bit different coming in front of you today. 
defaultThere are some key issues that I probably should focus on, which I think are important, and they are ubiquitous really.  The focus was global, but they were pointing to a few things
default: one 
defaultwas the importance of sustainability, sustainable intensification; the issue of consumption; the issue of waste; the issue of research funding; issues to do with the way that agriculture is likely to link in with climate change, in particular in terms of volatility
default; 
defaultand thinking about ways that we could be rather cleverer about dealing with the food system as a whole.  Those were the general things. 
defaultAfter a year we did a review
default—
defaultit was quite a long time ago now
default—
defaultof what actions had been taken, and they had been really quite pleasing
default.  A 
defaultlot of the recommendations in the report were taken up by Defra, and that work continues.  The Research Councils took up quite a lot of the agenda.  It is fair to say that the report has had also quite a lot of influence internationally.  In the first year after we produced it we gave presentations at the World Bank, the Food and Agriculture Organisation, and the International Food Agency, and so on. 
defaultAt the moment, what I am seeing is that the sort of implicit messages that came out of that report are still rather relevant today.  One of the exercises that followed on from the report was to say what 
defaultthe 
default100 key questions for agriculture
default are.  
defaultIn fact, on Monday there is a meeting in the Royal Society to ask what some of the key questions for 
defaultUK
default agriculture are, and that discussion meeting is going to happen on Monday evening next week
defaultThe first thing to say is that, when the report came out, we had had three or four decades of declining real prices
default; 
defaultpeople did not think very much about agriculture as being important.  There had been a decline in investment in production agriculture over those decades
default.  The 
defaultfocus had been much more on the environmental impact and issues of animal welfare, and so on, perfectly reasonably, but the report did wake up the community that this was really important.  I am answering rather at length
default; 
defaultshall I just stop there? 
defaultChair:default I am sure you will have the opportunity to comment more fully. 
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: Okay
default, 
defaultthat
default is what I thought. 
defaultQ60 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default First of all, congratulations on both the comprehensiveness 
default of the report 
defaultand on the international recognition that 
defaultit 
defaulthas achieved, which you must be very pleased with as the author.  Without prejudicing what might be discussed at the Royal Society, just looking first of all 
defaultat home, 
defaultwhat three actions would Defra take that you think would further food security just now? 
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: Can I put it in a global context, because I do not think—
defaultChair: defaultWe come on to global afterwards.
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: I understand
default that
default.  I do not think you can isolate the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default 
defaultfrom the rest of the world.  I think the global context of food security is, if anything, more severe now than it was three years ago when the report was written.  There are three things that I would point to: one is the enormous expected increase in the world population, another billion people by 2025; 
defaultthe 
defaultsecond is a big increase in urbanisation worldwide
default.  The 
defaultexpectation going out just 12 years
default is that 
defaultabout 60% of the world will be the urban environment.  
defaultThe other thing that is really happening, which in a sense is a good thing, is increasing prosperity
default.  A 
defaultlot of people are still in poverty, but the middle classes in the world are increasingly dramatically.  Just a rough figure would give you
default an idea that currently about 1
default&#xa0;
defaultbillion people in the developing world could be thought of as middle class
default; 
defaultthat is increasing by 100 million a year, so it will double in about 10 years.  That is the context, and all of these things point to increasing demand for natural resources
default—
defaultwater, food and energy
default—
defaultso that is the context we are in.  
defaultQ61 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default We will come on to those, but can I just ask you, locally we have seen great rafts of land under water, particularly in Somerset, and there is a call for farmland to be treated like any other property, particularly when you have got livestock that have been displaced on it and crops being ruined on it
default?  
defaultDo you personally believe that farmland should be offered better protection from flooding and be recognised as property in its own right? 
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: It would depend on which bits of farmland and where it is
default actually.  
defaultI do not think there is a general answer to that
default.  One 
defaultneeds to be thinking about natural equity and compensation if that was found to be the case.  To go to your original question
default on the key things
default, one of the things that is really important for the 
defaultUK
default 
defaultand we are seeing it now, is 
defaultenormous fluctuations in weather.  Historically agriculture has been, in a sense, dependent on its history, that what had worked in the past is likely to work in the future.  The issue with climate change is going to mean that we are going to see increasing volatility
default.
defaultQ62 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I accept that; that is the bigger picture.  I am just asking you
default if 
defaultyou think that we, as a country, should recognise farmland as property
default.  I
defaultf we are losing farmland to flooding, is this impacting on food security? 
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: I th
defaultought I had answered that, 
defaultChair, by saying that it depended which farmland
default and that, in any situation, 
defaultthere would need to be some sort of equity consideration.  If it is seen as more appropriate to use some farmland in that way, I do not think one would want to be generic that you should definitely do it in all cases or you should do it in some cases.  I do not think that is a sensible way to do it, but the obvious issues are to do with alternatives; for example, we have an issue in terms of productivity of the 
defaultUK
default food industry.  The trade balance is about £20 billion difference in terms of imports and exports
default.  For 
defaultthe good of the country, one could be thinking about more productivity on basic land in the 
defaultUK
default. 
defaultQ63 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Just on that point, are you concerned about the levels of self
default&#x2011;
defaultsufficiency in food production in thi
defaults country?  It is currently 62%;
default should it be higher? 
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: It is an awkward one that, because if one has, as it were, a slightly myopic view of self
default&#x2011;
defaultsufficiency
default,
default there have been real problems.  For example, the export bans on cereals that occurred in 2010
default&#x2011;
default11 contributed quite substantially but not entirely, primarily 
defaultby 
defaultthe 
defaultUkraine
default and 
defaultRussia
default, to food spikes and hardship caused by them, and similar export bans occurred on rice in previous years, so there is a problem.  Currently it is something like 60% self
default&#x2011;
defaultsufficiency, and is 60% the right answer, or is 62.3% the right answer?  I think 100% is manifestly the wrong answer.  There are going to be things around the margin where one can pose the question of whether one should rely on imports or try to improve on exports.  To an extent, the market, the consumer and the food system itself will drive that.  
defaultI see no particular problem in a policy position saying it would be nice to increase our self
default&#x2011;
defaultsufficiency, but it would be foolish to believe that you could increase self
default&#x2011;
defaultsufficiency by a dramatic amount, and that would be consumer
default&#x2011;
defaultdriven
default, because consumers like a variety.  It is unlikely we are going to grow coffee in 
defaultKent
default, for example. 
defaultQ64 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Do you think there are any lessons that could be learned in terms of food security from the horsemeat adulteration, particularly with regard to traceability and making the supply chain more resilient? 
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: There are some issues here that are quite complicated.  One of the ones is really whether there is a food safety issue, but also a question of fraudulent practice.  I do not think that there is much to learn beyond that particular thing that there are apparently fraudulent activities.  In terms of food security, I do not see that there is much to be learned from that, other than the fact that we do have the ability to detect adulterated products to really rather quite detailed levels.  
defaultIt is almost a joke that, if one used the level of testing, it is pretty certain you would find human DNA at some level, just because somebody had touched it.  One can have a ridiculous situation where one was saying, “no DNA other than the actual specified product”, and that is just not workable.  The pragmatic decision was taken at the time saying it has got to be greater than 1% before you take it seriously, and I was in Government at the time; I thought that was a very sensible and pragmatic decision. 
defaultQ65 default&#xa0; 
defaultSheryll Murray:default Professor 
defaultBeddington
default, 
defaultdoes 
defaultthe 
defaultUK
default 
defaulthave
default a role in responding to the imbalances in supply and demand for food at a global and a regional level? 
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: Could you perhaps expand on what you are looking for there because, although I heard the question perfectly adequately, I did not quite understand what sort of answer you were looking for? 
defaultQ66 default&#xa0; 
defaultSheryll Murray:default Basically, what should the 
defaultUK
default’s response be to ensure its own food security in the context of future expected global changes in supply and demand? 
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: I see, thank you.  We are in the pleasant position that we can buy on the world market and many of the products are available on the world market.  We are a sufficiently prosperous country that we can do it.  From time to time, we will see shortages of certain products in which the price will go up as normal price mechanisms.  In terms of a 
defaultUK
default response, one would be looking—again, it is round the margin of how self
default&#x2011;
defaultsufficient we want to be.  Is it attractive, for example, that we are dependent on a couple of countries for coffee?  Well, we do not have any choice, because we are not going to be able to grow it here. 
defaultIn terms of the amount of wheat that we currently grow, we could grow rather more wheat, but could it be grown more cheaply elsewhere?  I think the answer is yes.  It might be possible with fairly high inputs to grow other products, maize, soya and so on.  The question is really an economic rather than a scientific one: we could do it, but is that a particularly sensible thing to be doing?  It will be round the margin.  In a sense, the self
default&#x2011;
defaultsufficiency answer that I gave to the Chair would probably be much the same as I would give here.  We could do it, with some exceptions, but the question is one of economics and the market. 
defaultQ67 default&#xa0; 
defaultSheryll Murray:default What should the balance of responsibility be between Defra and DFID in addressing the imbalance at regional and global levels? 
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: That is an interesting question.  This is the sort of question I was asked when I was the chief scientist in Government and now, outside, I am allowed to answer it.  There is a funny feeling of freedom, is there not?  The first thing to say is that they clearly have to work together and, indeed, they do.  If we think about the sort of activities that DFID is doing, and they do put a lot of money into the agricultural research system, they work together.  One of the things that I could point to, which is some degree of achievement, is that the chief scientists of Defra and DFID meet regularly; they meet once a week, and that is the sensible way of co
default&#x2011;
defaultordinating at least the scientific work.  
defaultIn terms of the overall policy, it is highly unlikely that DFID, for example, if it wanted to go in for food aid, would see to buy in the 
defaultUK
default, because they can buy cheaper on the world markets.  Learning about research, I particularly think that the area of climate change is where co
default&#x2011;
defaultoperation is important.  Both Defra and DFID fund, for example, the Hadley Centre at the Met Office.  Essentially the agendas are complementary, but the same research questions need to be posed. 
defaultChair:default That has sparked a lot of interest.  
defaultQ68 default&#xa0; 
defaultIain McKenzie:default When you intimated that they are certain crops that we do not grow in this country or will not grow in this country, how far ahead do we place orders for those foods?  Is the order that is placed in a quantity that says, “We will pull X% amount of your production that year”?  How do we place that order? 
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: I do not know that I would seek to do it that way, if I understand the question.  There is a real issue to do with how closely involved the farming community is with 
defaultthese sorts of policies.  There are various regulations that can be brought in as policies, and there are taxes and so on, but in terms of the farming community’s response the key is going to be the market and how they would response from a market point of view.  Perhaps I misunderstood your question, because you are looking puzzled.
defaultQ69 default&#xa0; 
defaultIain McKenzie:default No, I am just wondering if we had this year a particularly bad year across the globe for certain crops, would we take that into account.  Would we project ahead and place that order, if there was a reduced supply, so that we would still take a large percentage of that? 
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: It depends on the size of the organisation.  If we think about the big retailers, they will certainly be looking ahead at whether there are likely to be any shortages of a particular crop, say coffee or chocolate.  They will be looking at alternative suppliers, because one of the things about the global food system is that you can look to alternative countries, so if there has been a disastrous harvest in one country you can look to another country for an alternative supply.  That is pretty much what, from what I understand, the big retailers do.  
defaultIf you were thinking about more common products, wheat and so on, the futures market is the way that that tends to work, and in a sense decisions will be taken both by people wanting to hedge prices, but also to buy forward.  I think that is the way the market is currently working.  If I may, Chair, I must say most of the questions are asking me about things to do with economics, and I was the Chief Scientific Adviser and still am a scientist, rather than an economist, I should say. 
defaultChair:default You are doing very well.  
defaultQ70 default&#xa0; 
defaultJim Fitzpatrick:default Professor, Sir John, very good to see you again and on such good form.  In terms of your answer to Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultMcKenzie, given that we have got some of the best brains in the country coming into Select Committees giving us answers, the surprise for me is that more of us do not look more puzzled more of the time, but that is because we have got poker faces sometimes and we do not show it.  
defaultJust something occurred to me in terms of 
defaultUK
default food production, the ability to feed ourselves and the figure of 60-something per cent.  Given climate change, and notwithstanding that farming is subsidised, given that we are operating in a free market, do you think that pattern is going to change, so that we will be exporting more in the future, because what we produce is more valuable?  Do you think that we will be producing more in the future and importing less?  How do you think that balance is going to change in the foreseeable? 
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: The honest answer to that, Mr Fitzpatrick, is that I do not know.  What I can say is some of the things that will affect it.  The first thing to say is that probably, if we are looking in the next two or three decades, the UK is going to suffer less ill effects from climate change than some other parts of the world.  To that extent, we are fortunate.  Most of the assessments that had come from analysis of climate change are saying that essentially 
defaultNorthern Europe
default and the temperate zones of the Northern Hemisphere are actually going to have relatively benign results from climate change.  With warming you may see things like the wheat belt move north in 
defaultCanada
default, 
defaultUkraine
default and 
defaultRussia
default, and so on.  
defaultHere, I think that we are fairly small in a world context.  We might expect to see some areas actually increase; others would be less.  One of the problems, and perhaps I should expand on that now, is that we are going to see an awful lot more volatility.  The point I was making to the Chair’s question was that farming has tended to rely on history, and the past is not going 
defaultto be anything like such a good guide 
defaultin 
defaultthe future, because we do know that we are going to see more volatility and more extreme events, and that is going to affect agriculture.  
defaultThe consequence of that, which I do think is important, is that we really are going to need better ability to forecast weather.  We obviously do it in terms of issues to do with human life, or property damage due to flooding, and so on, but I think there is real scope for linking meteorological prediction more closely to the farming community.  Everybody watches 
defaultCountryfile
default these days or listens to 
defaultFarming Today
default and you get a forecast, but it is well within the capability of our meteorologists now to predict on forecasts of a few days away very accurately, but also giving you some idea three or four weeks ahead.  
defaultFor example, not this last winter but the previous winter, it was pretty much predicted we were going to have a very, very cold period at the tail end of January or, last summer, that we were going to have a fairly mild autumn.  These are the sort of things that the farming community could benefit from a lot, I believe, and that is one of the things that I would be seeing as a change that will happen. 
defaultIn answer to your general question, are we going to be producing more or less, it will depend a lot on the commodity.  If, for example, we do see the sort of warming that is expected, I suspect we may be producing rather more horticultural products 
defaultw
defaulthen we 
defaulthave 
defaultpreviously imported
default them
default.  
defaultQ71 default&#xa0; 
defaultSheryll Murray:default Turning to your remark about another 1 billion population by 2025, will there not be a reduction in the birth rate as the emerging and developing economy income rises?   
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: That is a very good question.  From what we know about the sociology of fertility there are three factors that affect it: one is prosperity
default; 
defaultthe other is the education of women
default; 
defaultand the third is the availability of contraception.  Due to the way that the world population has changed, what we are looking at is essentially 500 million 
defaultadditional Africans by 2025 and
default 500 million additional Asians.  Africa has a bigger effect, because the current population is 1 billion; the current population of 
defaultAsia
default is about 4 billion.  
defaultAlbeit that you may see declines in fertility with increasing prosperity that comes after quite a time lag, and the current rate of increase is lower than it was 10
default&#x2011;
default15 years ago in most countries
default but, 
defaultbecause you have 
defaultmuch larger populations, 
defaultthe basic increment is
default much higher.  I find it breath
defaulttaking if I think about putting Africa together with the urbanisation population growth in 
defaultAfrica
default.  It 
defaultis saying that in 12 years’ time there will be about 1,000 
defaultadditional 
defaultcities the size of 
defaultEdinburgh
default.  
defaultI find that
default a breath
defaulttaking statistic and it will not be much affected by gradual declines in female fertility, but I do think on a timescale of 20 years or so
default 
defaultthese issues of population must be addressed.  They have got to come 
defaultup 
defaultto the forefront
default 
defaultbecause
default,
default if you do not get the decl
defaultine in fertility that one hopes, 
defaultyou are not talking about a population of 9 or 10 billion
default; 
defaultyou are talking about a couple of billion more, and that is truly problematic for civil society.   
defaultQ72 default&#xa0; 
defaultIain McKenzie:default Do you see more farmers taking dramatic steps to protect their crops in the future from extreme weather, and against slippage in seasons as well? 
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: The honest 
defaultanswer, Mr McKenzie, 
defaultis I really do not know
default.  I
default&#xa0;
defaultam not au fait with the farming community at quite that level of detail, 
defaultso 
defaultyou would get a better 
defaultor 
defaultmore informed answer from the NFU or farmers’ organisations.  What I would expect to see is that, for example, there would be more attempts to improve drainage
default; 
defaultto be thinking about 
defaultinputs that would provide protection against significant excess rain.  I also think you will start to see some changes in crop varieties as people decide to invest, depending on weather, on crop varieties that are more resistant to drought, or more resistant to excessive rain. 
defaultYou will see that, but it will be a relatively gradual change, except in areas like, for example, East Anglia, where you have the potential of flood surge or something, where people will have to think hard about dykes and keeping those in good repair.  
defaultQ73 default&#xa0; 
defaultNeil Parish:default Good afternoon
default,
default Professor 
defaultBeddington
default.  Further to Jim Fitzpatrick’s question, the Secretary of State wants to encourage consumers to buy more British food.  Is there an optimum balance between imported and domestically produced food? 
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: I do not really think so.  It would depend on the product, and I do not think you can say
default that 
default60% 
defaultis 
defaultoptimum or 62.4% 
defaultis 
defaultoptimum
default?
default  I just do not think there is an answer like that.  What you can reasonably say, and you need to analyse it by product, is to 
defaultask if 
defaultit 
defaultis 
defaultpossible to encourage the growth of a consumer appetite to buy British
default.  
defaultIf we are going back to the horsemeat scandal, I think you have seen a big change there in consumer habits, as they have focused more on
default British
default&#x2011;
defaultproduced
default product.  It is quite possible to see that consumer change.  
defaultI also think it is possible to be thinking about putting research into areas where you could be thinking about growing particular products more successfully in the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default environment than you have hitherto
default 
defaultand, again, that is a perfectly sensible thing to do.  One cannot attune these things to something approaching an optimum
default 
defaultbut, in a sense, if the direction of travel is that one erodes what is a trade defici
defaultt in food products of about £20
default&#xa0;
defaultbillion, then it has to be a direction of travel that is attractive to the country.  How much and how far you are going to be able to achieve that with different interventions is pretty much impossible to say at present.  
defaultQ74 default&#xa0; 
defaultNeil Parish:default Linked to Sheryll Murray’s question is that with the increase in world population, you also made the point that there would be 100
default million more every year becoming 
defaultmiddle class
default.  They 
defaultwill eat more meat.  It is not very fashionable to talk about meat production, but in the end we will need more meat in the world.  I know Jim will not necessarily eat it, but there will be people eating it.  
defaultTherefore, 
defaultis there an argument that more meat will be absorbed across the world, so we need to increase our meat production in this country? 
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: It is an economic situation, is it not?  Most of the increase in meat consumption is primarily in 
defaultAsia
default.  Actually, 
defaultthere has been very little in 
defaultIndia
default 
defaultand that area of the world in 
defaultSouth Asia
default.  In fact, there are very big increases in dairy consumption there, so it is slightly different.  In terms of the 
defaultUK
default, it would be possible, but it would depend on a lot of other things.  One of the problems about meat production, particularly chicken and pork at the moment, and
default 
defaultindeed
default 
defaultparts of the beef industry, is the cost of grain, which is being fed.  It is basically an economic argument.  I suppose it might be arguable that one should be thinking about intervening in farming and subsidising production of lamb or beef, and so on, but that is fairly unfashionable too. 
defaultQ75 default&#xa0; 
defaultNeil Parish:default Okay, I will not press you further.  As far as seasonal crops are concerned, one of the things about buying more British is that in the supermarket you will find that people want strawberries in 
defaultJanuary.  They 
defaultmay not taste of anything, but they want them.  If we are going to grow more crops out of season, which we can, but probably through greenhouses, 
defaultpolytunnels
default 
defaultor whatever, what is the likely impact of that? 
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: Taking strawberries, you have seen quite a substantial
default increase in home
default&#x2011;
defaultgrown product being used.  At the moment it is pretty unlikely we are going to grow much in mid-December, especially the December that we have just had, or the January we have just had, even under artificial light.  You have seen that increase primarily by either greenhouses or under sheltered production. 
default 
defaultI would expect that to happen in certain horticulture products
default; 
defaultothers less so.  Strawberries are a good case, where you have seen quite a substantial increase in the last decade. 
defaultQ76 default&#xa0; 
defaultNeil Parish:default What about the obstacles, in your opinion, to a more diversified agriculture
default in the 
defaultUK
default?  Is 
defaultit planning?  What is it?
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: I have not really given it
default any thought, I am afraid, 
defaultMr Par
defaultish.  I feel agriculture is fairly diversified
default.  It 
defaultis a 
defaultmarket
default&#x2011;
defaultdriven
default activity
default; 
defaultit is choice.  One of the dilemmas, for example, is whether you grow 
defaultbiofuels
default on grade A land. 
defaultQ77 default&#xa0; 
defaultNeil Parish:default I think you 
defaultwill 
defaultget a question about that in a minute.  For instance, should we hav
defaulte more big greenhouses such as Tha
defaultnet Earth, for instance? 
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: 
defaultOf 
defaultcourse
default 
defaultyou had Professor Benton and Professor 
defaultCrute
default with you
default.  They 
defaultare Th
defaultanet Earth fans, are they not?  It is an interesting question
default 
defaultbecause, in effect, that sort of production can be highly productive on not particularly good quality land.  That is going to be really important
default.  W
defaulte have in the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default 
defaultreally quite limited amounts of very high quality land
default.  C
defaultould we be thinking about using 
defaultbrownfield
default sites for the production of horticulture?  I think the answer is, yes
default; 
defaultit is a fairly substantial capital investment, but it could arguably pay off.  
defaultThe question that we need to be pondering is, going back to questions of national 
defaultfood security, self
default&#x2011;
defaultsufficiency
default and so on, which we have covered
default, 
defaultdo you really want to have a planning regime that allows top quality agricultural land to have alternative uses?  In a sense it is a political question, not 
defaultone 
defaultthat I would comment on.  
defaultQ78 default&#xa0; 
defaultNeil Parish:default 
defaultSuch as solar farms
default and the like? 
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: Yes, indeed.  
defaultNeil Parish:default I am leading the witness. 
defaultQ79 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default What is the attraction of purple tomatoes? 
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: Purple tomatoes?  This is the GM variety they have been developing in—
defaultNeil Parish:default Very good quality, 
defaultI imagine. 
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: In John Innes.  It is a consumer issue, is it not?  With any GM product it is not a consumer issue, because it is an issue of regulation by the European Commission, driven by the European Community.  
defaultOf the ones I would single out, p
defaulturple tomatoes is an attractive one, but the GM technology that has been developed at 
defaultRothamsted
default and the John Innes 
defaultCentre
default, two 
defaultof our 
defaultreally top 
defaultworld
default&#x2011;
defaultrated
default institutions
default, the blight
default&#x2011;
defaultfree
default potato that has been developed at John Innes could save an enormous amount of pesticide use.  The recent thing from last year
default was 
defaultwhen 
defaultRothamsted
default developed a wheat strain, 
defaultin 
defaultwhich they inserted a peppermint gene, which produced a pheromone that i
defaults the alarm pheromone of aphids.  That 
defaulthas the potential for growing wheat without any infestation of aphids whatsoever, and the aphids are not even lost to the ecosystem
default 
defaultbecause they just do not go there. 
default 
defaultThese sorts of GM technologies are really quite exciting.  
defaultThere was another one coming out of 
defaultRothamsted
default—
defaulta plant that could produce essentially the equivalent of fish oils, the Omega 3 plants
default.  T
defaulthere was a lot of publicity about
default that
default.  Again, we had the technology in our institutions.  The problem we have is European regulation, both driven by political considerations
default 
defaultand a view that, in a sense, that it is enormously difficult to get 
defaulta product licence
default.  The ability to get a GM product 
defaultlicenc
defaulte in 
defaultEurope
default is extremely difficult, and costs vast amounts of money, so that it is very hard to imagine any organisation other than a large profitable multinational doing it.  We are really losing out here. 
defaultChair:default We come on
default to that; 
defaultI was just
default making a flippant remark.
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: We come on to that, okay.  You asked me about GM product. 
defaultChair:default I 
defaultjust 
defaultdo not like the thought of purple tomatoes
default myself.  
defaultQ80 default&#xa0; 
defaultRichard Drax:default Professor, can I come on to the increased 
defaultdemand for 
defaultfood, in particular protein
default?  
defaultI will give you the background, if I
default may, before I ask the question, 
defaultto help you answer it, from the interviews we had previously.  A lot of the soya comes from 
defaultSouth America
default for processed foods, and Professor Benton told us that 
default70% 
defaultof foods in the supermarket contain soya.  Professor 
defaultCrute
default cautioned, and I quote, “It may be much more sustainable to produce the protein you want on land in 
defaultBrazil
default that has already been cleared of forest than to 
defaultclear more land in this country
default.
default”
default  The increase of things like meat and dairy in China have increased fivefold per capita
default, again 
defaultProfessor Benton said, 
defaultthe 
defaultend result of which is the challenge of importing large amount
defaults
default of soya
default.  I
defaultf 
defaultChina
default wants more food
default, food prices are going to rise
default.  
defaultWith 
defaultthis expected increase in demand for protein in countries like 
defaultChina
default, parts of Africa
default and 
defaultSouth East Asia
default, how is this going to be achieved sustainably, do you think? 
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: There is an interesting issue here
default.  
defaultBrazil
default is the obvious country to look at, because they produce a very substantial amount of soya protein, primarily for animal consumption.  Most of that is now GM; there is a tiny amount of non
default&#x2011;
defaultGM soya being produced, to the extent that it is very hard to even find it, because the GM technology for soya is enormously economically attractive.  The fact that non
default&#x2011;
defaultGM product has some price premium is of indifference to the farmers that are actually producing it. 
default 
defaultWe are going to see more GM technology in the developing world, and we import substantial amounts of GM soya now, and it is used for the meat trade. 
default 
defaultIn terms of significantly increasing 
defaultthe production 
defaultof—let us take soya, but other protein cereals would be worth thinking about—there is lots of potential.  There are very substantial amounts of lan
defaultd, which is moderately degraded;
default it is not tropical rainforest in 
defaultBrazil
default, and one could be thinking about expanding there, and I expect people have.  I think the same goes for parts of northern 
defaultArgentina
default, which I expect to see now. 
defaultOddly enough, I think that we will start to see production in parts of 
defaultAfrica
default of high
default&#x2011;
defaultlevel protein.  
defaultW
defaulte have all heard of horror stories of land grabs
default 
defaultand so on
default but, 
defaultas there is de
defaultvelopment in Sub-Saharan Africa, 
defaultwe may see an increase in production of crops with a high protein content.  There is no doubt there is a shortage of them. 
defaultQ81 default&#xa0; 
defaultRichard Drax:default What impact is this going to have on the 
defaultUK
default and EU food security over the next 10 to 15 years, do you think? 
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: The issue is really of a price relationship.  There is a world price for soya
default.  The 
defaultimporting 
defaultcompanies 
defaultbuy on the world marke
defaultt.  If there becomes a shortage, 
defaultthe price will go up
default 
defaultand it will have an impact on food inflation and general inflation in this country, as it could in the European Union.  I do not think we are going to be in a situation 
defaultof protein starvation
default; 
defaultit is just a price mechanism that will harvest it, and we are a wealthy country compared with other parts of the world.  We will not be in a situation where we will not be able to buy 
defaultin 
defaultthe protein.  The issue is round the margin
default.  It 
defaultis whether, in fact, pig production
default or 
defaultchicken production is going to be profitable 
defaultin 
defaultthe 
defaultUK
default 
defaultif you are 
defaultimporting grains or soya to feed at what is a very high price. 
defaultQ82 default&#xa0; 
defaultRichard Drax:default What will be the principal resource limitations to increased food output given that land is limited? 
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: The big ones are clearly water.  Are you asking 
defaultUK
default or worldwide? 
defaultRichard Drax:default Yes, 
defaultUK
default. 
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: Ludicrously there is an issue about water
default.  It 
defaultdoes not feel like it at the moment
default but, in fact, 
defaultmost of the projections are indicating we might expect to have quite a dry South of 
defaultEngland
default, where there will be some issues there.  We have some issues to do with fertiliser, whether it is nitrogen
default&#x2011;
default or phosphorus
default&#x2011;
defaultbased
default fertiliser, and we need to be thinking hard about that.  There are going to be issues to do with the use of these fertilisers
default 
defaultand
default 
defaultindeed
default 
defaultthe use of pesticides, because we have a major problem of insect pests and fungi
default as well
default. 
defaultThere is some real hope here in terms of the better use of engineering, and what we roughly term 
default‘
defaultprecision agriculture
default’
default.  I was recently at 
defaultHarper
default 
defaultAdams
default 
defaultUniversity
default where they have got a group focusing exactly on trying to have better precision agriculture, so you use less fertiliser, you use less pesticide and you use less water.  There is a real future in that at the 
defaulthigh
default&#x2011;
defaulttech end. 
defaultThe other thing that I would point 
defaultto as a potential constraint is, I suppose, 
defaultthe weather in general.  We are an island on the edge of a large ocean and on the edge of a large continent, and we have
default really quite variable and very difficult to predict 
defaultweather.  This is one of the reasons when I was answering Mr Fitzpatrick’s question I was saying that I think we really need to be looking quite hard at better prediction in the agricultural area. 
defaultRichard Drax:default Just quickly, GM food linked all those
default answers.
defaultChair:default We are coming on to GM.  
defaultRichard Drax:default You are?  In which case, I withdraw.  Thank 
defaultyou very much indeed. 
defaultQ83 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Can I just ask, are you worried about the impact on food production of water that might be used in 
defaulthydraulic 
defaultfracking
default? 
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: You asked my colleagues about that, did you not? 
defaultChair:default I might have done. 
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: I think it is a public record now.  Yes, I think it is not going to be a big deal actually, if you think about the amount of water that is actually used in agriculture
default.  
defaultFracking
default uses a lot
default and 
defaultit might be a local issue, but it is not going to be an issue on a large scale.  
defaultThe issues to do with water use 
defaultin 
defaultfracking
default are a concern about the pollution of aquifers
default.  A 
defaultreport that I commissioned while I was in Government by the Royal Academy of Engineering and the Royal Society pointed out that
default, 
defaultwith sensible regulation of the wells
default,
default there really 
defaultshould be no danger, because the water aquifers are very substantially separated by about a kilometre from the reservoirs of gas and oil.  To speak quite simply, unless you have got a 
defaultleaky well
defaulthead, you are not going to do it; there will not be migration between. 
default 
defaultThat is pretty much a consensus of the science and engineering community. 
default 
defaultThe pollution is an issue, but can be dealt with by regulation.  
defaultIn terms of the amount of water that is actually needed for 
defaultfracking
default, production of energy, whether it is via 
defaultfracking
default or 
defaultin 
defaultthe normal 
defaultprocesses 
defaultin power stations, does use an awful lot of water, but I can only imagine it being a local effect, rather than a country
default&#x2011;
defaultwide
default one. 
defaultQ84 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default But you do not actually 
defaultknow.
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: I think one does not ever know anything very much, does one, if we are going to be philosophical about this
default?
default  I could enquire, but there are others who 
defaultwould 
defaulthave basically done that calculation, but
default 
defaultin fact
default, one way, 
defaultI do not know.  I 
defaultwould 
defaultsee lots of reasons why it could not be very large, because of the arithmetic really. 
defaultQ85 default&#xa0; 
defaultNeil Parish:default Just going back to the import of soya, or importing chicken meat and pig 
defaultmeat 
defaultthat has been fed on GM soya, it has the potential to put our own industry out of business.  The irony is that
default, in the end, 
defaultpeople will be eating the exact same meat that has been fed on GM products.  Is it not time we and 
defaultEurope
default changed our mind
defaults
default on th
defaultis?  People are still eating it, 
defaultirrespective of whether we use it or not
default.
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: 
defaultMy 
defaultown views on the GM ban
defaults are that 
defaultthey are not evidence
default&#x2011;
defaultbased
default. 
defaultChair:default We are coming on to that, so we do not want to—
defaultNeil Parish:default Considering, Madam Chairman, 
defaultyou got on to 
defaultfracking
default 
defaultwhich, in my opinion, had absolutely nothing to do with this, I really think that we can actually pursue a question. 
defaultChair:default We are coming on to that
default.  
defaultQ86 default&#xa0; 
defaultMrs Lewelldefault&#x2011;defaultBuckdefault:default 
defaultProfessor 
defaultBeddington
default, you will be pleased that I have got a bit of 
defaulta 
defaultscience question for you.  Earlier you said 
defaultthat the 
defaultUK
default will suffer less from climate change, but obviously bearing in mind that we will be affected by it, what is it that we should be looking at in the longer
default&#x2011;
defaultterm picture to try and mitigate the future effects of it? 
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: Do you mean just in agriculture, or do you mean more generally? 
defaultMs Lewell-Buck: defaultMor
defaulte generally, if you can.
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: The first thing to do is that we do need to continue to invest in the science of climate change.  One of the things that is not really appreciated in our knowledge
default is that 
defaultthe weather we are getting currently is determined not by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere now, but the greenhouse gases that were in the atmosphere in the 1990s.  The climate system has a 20
default&#x2011;
default25
default&#x2011;
defaultyear time delay in it, so in the 1990s greenhouse gases had accumulated, and the weather we are now seeing is coming from essentially the climate that was determined 25 years ago.  
defaultIf you extrapolate that, obviously there has been an increase since the 1990s in greenhouse gases, so we know
default that
default, if we look 25 years down the track, the weather we are going to be getting is going to be determined by that increased level.  It is likely to be more volatile
default; it is likely to be 
defaultparticularly volatile if we think about the 
defaultUK
default.  We would also have an expectation 
defaulttherefore that you would get more extreme events
default.  The 
defaultrain will be heavier
default; 
defaultthe droughts will be longer
default; 
defaultheat waves will be more severe.  There is a real consensus that this is the pattern of climate change that we should expect.  
defaultIt is going to mean issues to do with infrastructure.  In particular, we are going to need to be thinking about 
defaulthow 
defaultwe have flood defences.  The question you were asking me earlier 
defaultwas 
defaultabout whether farmland should be used as a flood defence
default.  
defaultI heard on the 
defaultToday 
defaultprogramme that the World Wildlife Fund was saying that they thought it should.  It is a question of individual
defaults, 
defaultwhere, when, how
default and if it 
defaultcan be done by agreement
default.  
defaultWe have got to expect more extreme weather, and, in consequence, to hark back to the point I was making, if we are having more extreme weather we have to be able to know it is coming.  We have to be able to know it is coming on as long a time period as we possibly can, and that means continuing research in both climate and meteorology.  That is the science answer.  Whether the South East of England is going to grow peaches, the answer is probably, but I would not like to give you a timescale on it here. 
defaultQ87 default&#xa0; 
defaultRoger Williams:default Greenhouse gas emissions from livestock production is a very contentious issue. 
default There seem
default to be two ways in which you can reduce it, either by altering the management 
defaultor 
defaulthusbandry of the livestock, or by just reducing consumption of livestock products, whether they are dairy or meat.  Should we be doing either or both, or can we do either or both? 
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: It is a very under
default&#x2011;
defaultresearched
default project.  In terms of thinking about diet for livestock, there has not been much research on it.  There is now a worldwide programme looking at what interventions can be done for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from livestock, and that really is a big international programme, which a number of our main research institutes and universities are involved in.  There is stuff that can be done
default.  F
defaultor example, if we are talking about manipulating the
default flora in the rume
defaultn, one could be thinking about doing that, which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions, when you think about diet. 
defaultThere are also mechanisms whereby substantial intensification means that you can capture the greenhouse emissions as well as the other waste products.  There are obviously costs and benefits 
defaultto 
defaultboth activities.  The question is really one about land use, and that is almost both a regulation and a commercial question.  What is the alternative for our uplands?  
defaultIt is p
defaultretty much livestock production or forestry, and in a sense that is a political and economic decision for those who are on the land.  
defaultThe thing that I would say is
default that
default, if we are talking about the 
defaultUK
default, substantial meat diets with a lot of red meat are known to be unhealthy
default so, 
defaultfrom a public health point of view
default,
default a reduction is important.  Worldwide what we are seeing is a big increase in the appetite for meat, particularly in 
defaultChina
default and 
defaultthe Middle East, 
defaultbut 
defaultless so in 
defaultIndia
default, as I mentioned earlier.  There are quite large areas of the world where livestock is the only possible productive activity for the land
default.  You 
defaultcannot decide whether you are going to grow livestock or you 
defaultare 
defaultgoing to grow wheat
default.  
defaultLarge parts of land do not have that as an alternative and livestock is the only way.  
defaultThe thing I feel is that it really has just not been researched enough, and that is a bit of a pity.  When I was in Government I was pushing to say that we need more research on this, and now I am not in Government I will still say it, but probably with a lot less effect.  
defaultRoger Williams:default It is nice to hear that this is being taken seriously on a global scale.  
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: It is. 
defaultQ88 default&#xa0; 
defaultRoger Williams:default Do you think our Government is taking it seriously, either by modifying livestock husbandry or through reduction of consumption? 
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: The research institutions that are involved are there, and you would have to ask Defra what their current plans are.  I stopped being in Government in April of last year, so I am not quite so up to date with what is actually happening.  As I say, it is the naked feeling of not having officials around who immediately pass me the answer to your question.  I cannot answer, Mr Williams, I am afraid at the moment. 
defaultQ89 default&#xa0; 
defaultRoger Williams:default You have already mentioned the great value that people in 
defaultBritain
default put on our uplands.  There may be two alternatives, either livestock production or forestation.  Any change in livestock production will have huge changes in the appearance of our uplands, but also the third alternative was on 
defaultCountryfile
default 
defaulton Sunday night
default, which
default was George 
defaultMonbiot
default with his concept of 
defaultrewilding
default.  Is it really important that we keep our uplands the way they are
default 
defaultor are 
defaultthere 
defaultreal alternatives? 
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: Again, it goes down to economics and politics.  In fact, tourism is an important source of income for the country
default.  There 
defaultis a lot of tourism income 
defaultthat 
defaultcomes 
defaultinto the northern uplands
default, because they look like they do at the moment.  Whether birch scrub would be quite as attractive for a tourist visit I would rather doubt.  I did not see the 
defaultMonbiot
default programme
default; 
defaultI was told about it, so I could not comment in any detail.  There are alternative uses
default.  You 
defaultcan think about nature reserves
default and 
defaultusing some areas of land to be more attractive to relatively rare species
default.  
defaultManifestly that is there, but you are not going to 
defaultdo 
defaultthe whole of the northern uplands in that way, or at least I cannot imagine 
defaultthat 
defaultyou would. 
defaultQ90 default&#xa0; 
defaultRoger Williams:default There is a lot of mention of the emissions of greenhouse gases from agriculture, but agriculture also takes in a lot of carbon dioxide every year.  
defaultAre there 
defaultcalculations about netting off the difference between the uptake of carbon dioxide by crops, grass, and goodness k
defaultnows what against the emissions?  Has that been 
defaultdone accurately
default 
defaultor do you think 
defaultthat 
defaultmore work needs to be done on that? 
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: It can be done accurately
default.  
defaultI could not answer in general.  Back in 2011, I chaired an International Commission on Agriculture and Climate Change, and part of that was to say, if we are going to increase food production to the sort of levels that are needed to meet food security issues, and we continue to use the same techniques in agriculture, then greenhouse gas emissions will soar.  There is a real dilemma there.  One of the programmes that has started from that, which is quite substantially funded by the international community, is focusing on climate smart agriculture: i.e. agriculture that is not using substantial amounts of fertilisers that are based on using greenhouse gases, in the Haber
default&#x2011;
defaultBosch
default process
default 
defaultand so on. 
defaultSome of the techniques that are coming are working quite well.  One of the ones that has been used in parts of Sub
default&#x2011;
defaultSaharan Africa is agro
default&#x2011;
defaultforestry
default, so you have crops intermixed with trees.  That has the benefit of both sheltering the crop, but also increasing production. 
default I
default&#xa0;
defaultcould probably let your clerk have reference to that particular report, and there were 10 recommendations that came out of it.  
defaultOne of the follow
default&#x2011;
defaultups from that commissioned report was to go to the climate meeting in 
defaultDurban
default in 
defaultSouth Africa
default, and make a proposal that there should be a programme for agriculture as part of the climate change discussions.  That would be a really good thing
default.  It 
defaultdid not get through
default—
defaultit was not accepted
default—
defaultbut it still continues, because this is really important.  Agriculture could be
default 
defaultnot just a problem for greenhouse gas emissions
default; 
defaultit could be a significant solution
default, so your point is well taken, 
defaultMr Williams. 
defaultQ91 default&#xa0; 
defaultIain McKenzie:default Can I take you back briefly on what you touched upon in diet change
default.  You 
defaultsaid 
defaultthat 
defaultthe Government is encouraging
default 
defaultdiet change in all areas of the country.  Governments are encouraging diet change away from certain foods that are grown 
defaulttraditionally
default.  Do you see that beginning to impact on the farming community, what crops they are growing, and do you see that kind of impact in the future, as they move away from potatoes with every meal
default 
defaultand red meat
defaults
default? 
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: I would not expect it to have much effect on farming at the moment, but there are some issues.  There is no doubt that there is an obesity epidemic in the developed world, but also there is an 
defaultincreasing problem with obesity, early
default&#x2011;
defaultonset
default diabetes and 
defaultearly
default&#x2011;
defaultonset
default cardiovascular problems in the developing world as well.  They are all diet related.  The irony the people point to is 1 billion people 
defaultin starvation
default&#x2011;
defaultrelated
default poverty and 1
default&#xa0;
defaultbillion people 
defaultwho are 
defaultobese
default.  It is 
defaultone of the ironies of the world condition. 
defaultThe sorts of questions that are quite interesting are not so much to do with obesity, but to do with malnutrition.  Quite a lot of the crops that are grown in the developing world are insufficient in terms of key nutrients.  I am sorry
default; 
defaultI sound like a bit of a broken record, but I am chairing an International Commission, which is funded by DFID, US
defaultA
defaultID, and the Gates Foundation, to look at agriculture and malnutrition.  One of the dilemmas is 
defaultthat 
defaultcountries could grow more wheat, more soya
default 
defaultor more maize.  They would do that, and it would be more profitable, but it would be at the expense of a poorer quality diet.  One needs to be thinking about that
default 
defaultand one answer is supplements
default; 
defaultone answer is some form of GM intervention
default 
defaultthat you can actually get better nutrient quality 
defaultfrom 
defaultparticular crops.  I think that is it. 
defaultIn terms of the basic obesity issue, the main issues are prim
defaultarily sugar
default&#x2011;
defaultrelated
default, are they not?  Most of the sugar is tending to come from sugar cane; I cannot see 
defaultthat 
defaultthis is going to have much effect on the farming community at the moment.  It may do, but
default I doubt it.  What you will see, however, 
defaultis an increase in the organic movement
default and 
defaultwhat is seen as healthier food, although the underlying science behind that is more debatable. 
defaultQ92 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Spencer:default I wondered if you could explain in laymen’s terms, for someo
defaultne simple like me to understand, 
defaultwhat you mean by 
default‘
defaultsustainable intensification
default’.
default 
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: I could see that one coming, because I read 
defaultthat 
defaultyou asked other people for that. 
defaultMr Spencer:default I still have not got the answer
default though
default.  
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: You are going to see how consistent we all are.  The idea of intensification is manifestly sensible.  We do not have much land
default; 
defaultwe do have an issue of food production; we need to get more from the same amount of land.  On the other hand, it would be a pretty daft thing to do
default 
defaultto be getting more by having very
default large inputs of fertiliser, 
defaultpesticides
default 
defaultand so on.  The intensification and the increase 
defaultin product per unit area need
default to be balanced against how you actually do it. 
defaultQ93 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Spencer:default In a global sense or a 
defaultUK
default sense? 
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: Sustainable intensification can apply to an individual farm, because you could say to an individual farm, “Can you produce more from the same amount of land by increasing some form of changing your management practice?”  Now, if you are changing your management practice in a way that, for example, you ultimately 
defaultmight pollute your water
defaultcourses
default 
defaultor 
defaultthat you are, for example, 
defaultovergrazing and therefore could not continue
default—so 
defaultyou could produce vastly more sheep on the northern uplands for a while, but they would th
defaulten revert to being unproductive—s
defaultustainability comes in
default.  I
defaultntensification is more from less; sustainable intensification is
default not to 
defaultharm the environment in 
defaulta 
defaultway that you cannot continue forever, whether it is 
defaultover
defaultgrazing or 
defaultover
defaultuse of fertilisers.  
defaultQ94 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Spencer:default Is 
defaultUK
default agriculture fit for purpose?  Can we deliver that in our current form?  
defaultProf defaultBeddingtondefault: We are seeing lots of ways in which we can do it.  I referred earlier, for example, to high
default&#x2011;
defaultprecision
default agriculture, which is actually doing that.  We are looking at ways in which we can better control insect pests in a more efficient way, rather than just using pesticides.  There is so
default&#x2011;
defaultcalled “biological pest control” or integrated pest control.  We are using that.  There are a lot of indications that, for example, some nitrogen fertilisers are probably overused, and that you could probably increase the yield by cutting back.  That is certainly the case elsewhere in the world, although whether a particular farm in the 
defaultUK
default is doing that, I do not know and would not comment.  
defaultThere are things that we can do to increase production.  For example, our typical yields of wheat are about 8
default&#xa0;
defaulttonnes per hectare.  
defaultRothamsted
default has a programme that they are following to try to get 20 tonnes per hectare from wheat.  That would be a mix of breeding, agricultural practice, precision agriculture and so on, and they want to do that in 20 years.  I think they started in 2012.  There is a real recognition that this can be done.  Elsewhere in the world, you are seeing these sorts of increases in the level of productivity.  
defaultQ95 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Spencer:default Is that knowledge transfer trickling down to normal farmers?  How are we going to get that knowledge transfer down the pyramid?
defaultProf defaultBeddingtondefault: That is a very good question.  The answer is that this is a thing that Government has certainly understood.  I cannot believe Ian 
defaultCrute
default did not mention the 
defaultAgri
default&#x2011;
defaultTech
default strategy to you, but this is a strategy that is aimed at making sure that research actually gets used in the farming industry.  It is really important.  There is no point in characters in white coats sitting around in laboratories doing very, very cunning things if it does not actually come down to the farmer and have some practical use.  
defaultWhen I was in Government, I started the Food Research Partnership, which is ongoing and had the research institutes and the key Government Departments, but also had big agri
default&#x2011;
defaultbusiness organisations like 
defaultSyngenta
default and big retailers like Marks &amp; Spencer.  It also had the National Farmers’ 
defaultUnion
default and so on.  Part of the programme of that was to say, “How can we better get research results to be used by the individual farmer?”  This is something that I think is really important.  Both the NFU and other organisations are really trying hard to get that done.  Certainly, the research institutions understand that, so there is a big programme of communication.
defaultQ96 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Spencer:default Obviously, taxpayers’ money is finite and we need to get the balance right between applied research, knowledge transfer and, I suppose, the more simplistic measures of how we can improve agriculture and the industrial environmental schemes, if you like.  Where is the balance between those three different types of knowledge requirement?  
defaultProf defaultBeddingtondefault: We do need to be thinking pretty hard about environmental issues, but again it is a policy question.  Would one wish to put aside areas of land that would be very attractive to species that are endangered?  That in a sense is a straight economic choice driven by whatever regulations and incentives are out there.  Other ones are much more regulation.  You really would want, and you really do have, quite strong regulation, for example, on the 
defaultuse of nitrates to protect watercourses.  You have regulation in terms of agricultural chemicals that you are allowed to use, which do actually form the mechanism of protecting the environment.  You need both.  
defaultQ97 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Spencer:default Maybe I did not frame the question in the right way.  What I am saying is, to go to the extreme, you could put all of your money into research and you could let the market, if you like, trickle that knowledge down to producers.  Would that be the right approach?  If not, how much should Government be investing in that knowledge transfer, or is that not their job at all?  
defaultProf defaultBeddingtondefault: In a sense, it is a political decision.  You clearly need to have some fundamental research, but it is important
default—
defaultand I think Government recognises that
default—
defaultto work out ways that that research is actually going to be used.  
defaultThe

default strategy that you have all been told about, as part of that, says “We think research should be encouraged but that research needs to go into the appropriate industries,” whether it is in individual farming, the processing industry or the reservation industry.  These are things that need to be done.  I do not think there is an easy answer, again, on what proportion of funding should be done.  That is, in a sense, for debate.  You can manifestly see that the extremes are daft, but where the balance lies is, I think, a political discussion process rather than anything that you would get scientific advice on.  
defaultQ98 default&#xa0; 
defaultRoger Williams:default Following on from Mark’s question, in the good old days there would be an extension service like ADAS with experimental farms and things like that.  Now, virtually all the advice that people get is commercial advice, which ends up with the message of “Buy my product,” “Use my piece of equipment” or whatever.  Do you think we have gone too far down that way?  Is there a role for having an organisation that gives advice that looks at the needs of farmers and the environment?  
defaultProf defaultBeddingtondefault: Do you mean ADAS and things like that?  That was very much the conclusion of the Food Research Partnership study.  Again, I will pass that study to the clerk.  I think the sorts of issues you raise are perfectly reasonable.  
defaultChair:default I would just ask you to hold fire on this, because we are coming straight on to that now.
defaultProf defaultBeddingtondefault: So Mr Williams cheated, did he?  He got an extra question in.
defaultChair: defaultI could not possibly comment at all.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ99 default&#xa0; 
defaultIain McKenzie:default A question just popped into my head on the subject of sustainable intensification and efficiency.  Do you think a separate 
defaultScotland
default would re
default&#x2011;
defaultintroduce
default the run
default&#x2011;
defaultrig
default system?  You do not need to answer.  
defaultProf defaultBeddingtondefault: The straight answer to that is that I do not know.
defaultIain McKenzie:default We are told there is a gap between scientific research and its translation in the application to farmers.  What is your view on that?  
defaultProf defaultBeddingtondefault: I certainly think that we could do better.  There is no doubt about it at both ends, and the sort of issues that we need to be thinking about are that the research institutes take on the activity of making certain that what they produce is actually readable, and readable by the layman.  One of the most difficult things that I had when I was Chief Scientist was pronouncing the names of various chemicals, because people thought you were an idiot if you got them wrong, so I had to get my officials to give me a phonetic 
defaultpronunciation before I went into a meeting.  That is a cautionary tale for research institutes that would tend to produce things full of Latin names and chemical formulae that are actually meaningless to farmers.  There is a proper way of actually dealing with that.  
defaultSome of the discussions that you have seen recently, for example about that GM crop producing Omega
default&#x2011;
default3, were readable.  It was sensible; people could understand it.  It was not hiding behind complex jargon.  That is one of the things that I would very much encourage and like to see.  To the extent that Government can influence this, I think most people would agree that that is the right thing to be doing.  
defaultQ100 default&#xa0; 
defaultIain McKenzie:default Would you say that other EU states are better at assisting their farmers to access technical information?  
defaultProf defaultBeddingtondefault: 
defaultHolland
default is very much better, but I think that that is, in part, because of the type of agriculture that they have, which is a lot involving greenhouse and a lot of fairly intensive pig and poultry.  I think there are mechanisms whereby the research results get rather quicker into the farming community there, but that is an anecdotal feeling rather than any real evidence, Mr McKenzie.  I could not say, for example, whether 
defaultItaly
default is better than 
defaultFrance
default.  I have no idea.
defaultQ101 default&#xa0; 
defaultIain McKenzie:default In your opinion, what could the Government do at present to help bridge that gap?
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: I think that that is probably a question for my successor and maybe for the Chief Scientist in Defra.  What I can speak for is the university research institutes where I am still involved and to say that it is recognised as an issue and they are trying to do it.  Organisations like the Technology Strategy Board are involved in the 
defaultAgri
default&#x2011;
defaultTech
default strategy, and part of their job is to move things nearer and nearer to market.  When I was there, we were developing these ideas through the Food Research Partnership, and they have been followed, to an extent, by Defra.
defaultQ102 default&#xa0; 
defaultRoger Williams:default As somebody who regrets the fact that GM technology has not been adopted in this country, can you tell us if there is any way in which it can recover its acceptance by the political classes, the public and the Government?
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: Just to give you a flavour, I think our research institutions are right at the forefront of research in this area.  The key thing here, of course, is that it is Government research and that there is no intellectual property that is retained; the intellectual property is available to all.  I think that that is really rather important, because the early introduction of GM technology was very much associated with concerns that there was intellectual property, monopoly rights and so on, and that this was, in a sense, an intervention by big business which would generate more monopoly profits and so on.  I think that, at that time, that was probably a reasonable concern.  I do not think that that is the case now.  A lot of the GM research that we have been talking about this afternoon, you will see, is coming out of Government laboratories.
defaultThe problem that we have is that there is not an evidence base that is sensible.  The Chief Scientist for the European Commission, Anne Glover, who used to be Chief Scientist for 
defaultScotland
default, was quoted last year as saying, “I have seen no evidence that GM crops, when taken, produce any harmful effects on humans or animals.”  Nobody contradicted her in saying, “Here is the evidence,” apart from some groups, and I think that that remains the case.  One needs, with GM technology, to be careful, but it is not a generic thing.  
defaultThere is a GM potato.  Is it safe?  Does it have these side effects?  There is GM wheat.  Is it safe?  Does it have these side effects?  It is not a thing that you say, à priori, “Let us dismiss it.”  If it can solve a problem and has been properly tested for both human health and environmental safety, prohibiting it a priori seems inappropriate.
defaultQ103 default&#xa0; 
defaultRoger Williams:default Do you think that there was an overemphasis on the precautionary principle or was it using the precautionary principle in a way for which it was not intended?
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: Yes, I think there is, and I think that the use of the precautionary principle is one that I believe has been overused in arguments about not just GM technology but, for example, about agricultural chemicals.  The issue that is really quite dramatic as an overuse of the precautionary principle, particularly in European legislation, has been the failure to distinguish between hazard and risk.  A hazard is something that, at some large dosage, produces an effect of a carcinogen or an endocrine disruptor, but there is no distinction made on the dose.  If something is a carcinogen or an endocrine disruptor, under certain types of legislation, it would be banned anyway, irrespective that you would have to use enormous dosages to do it.
defaultThere was a case, when I was in Government, of a chemical called 
defaultbisphenol
default A, which is used in the production of babies’ bottles.  The only way 
defaultbisphenol
default A would hurt children would be if you hit them with a large container containing it.  There is absolutely no evidence that the sort of dosage levels that it was coming in was any harm.  It was a profound misunderstanding of the precautionary principle and the difference between hazard and risk.
defaultQ104 default&#xa0; 
defaultRoger Williams:default Do you think that the present stance that the European Union has on GM is affecting food security?
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: I think it is actually affecting nutrition and the way that world trade operates, because there is no doubt that, because some countries wish to export into the European Union and there are very strong regulations on GM technology, some states have been discouraged from using GM technology in a situation where they could be helped by it.  I think there is a problem, but the problem is more around nutrition issues.  For example, there is a strain of rice that has a vitamin A supplement which would be extraordinarily helpful in reducing blindness in children.
defaultQ105 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default If we could just wrap up with a couple of quick
default&#x2011;
defaultfire
default questions, if we may. Is the issue of GM not to do more with cross-contamination of other crops, being a crowded island and using the technology in this country?
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: I do not quite understand the question, Chair.  I am sorry.
defaultQ106 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I think you answered Mr Williams’ question as to there being no danger to human health.  I am a sceptic on GM crops; I remain to be convinced.  I
default&#xa0;
defaultthought one of the difficulties was crossover and cross-contamination on other crops nearby.
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: I think it is an evidence base, Chair, and the evidence is not there.  There is certainly cross-contamination of GM crops into others but, in terms of the effect on human health, I know of no evidence whatsoever.
defaultQ107 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default It is not to human health; it is to other crops.  It is the Prince of Wales’ point that you are going to contaminate crops close by, permanently.
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: There are appropriate regulations for spatial separation.  I
default&#xa0;
defaultthink that needs looking at.  You would not want things to be unregulated, but you need to have proper and appropriate regulation and that is a perfectly reasonable point.
defaultQ108 default&#xa0; 
defaultRichard Drax:default Bearing in mind Professor Benton’s comments about 70% of food in supermarkets containing soya, much of which is GM, we are eating this stuff anyway, are we not?  It is being consumed every day, whether we know about it or not, is it not?
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: Yes.
defaultRichard Drax:default It is not affecting us in any way.
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: There are some statistics pointing to the enormous number of meals using GM product that have been eaten in North America, and there has not been one single case brought by what is a very litigious society on harm to human health that has come from eating GM-related product.
defaultQ109 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Could I just ask on 
defaultbiofuels
default?  Should crops be grown for production of 
defaultbiofuels
default and does this have an impact on food security, in your view?
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: The simple arithmetic, of course, is that, if you grow 
defaultbiofuels
default on land, you are not going to grow food, so the answer is, in a simplistic way, yes; but it is perfectly reasonable to ask, “Could you grow 
defaultbiofuels
default on land that would not be highly productive for growing alternative arable crops or livestock?”  The answer is yes, they can.  The emphasis should probably be less on first-generation 
defaultbiofuels
default, which are things like sugar cane and so on, which are used to produce ethanol, but on the second and third generation, which are things that can be developed on the basis of agricultural waste.  There is enormous potential for that.  The BBSRC has been running a research programme on that for a long time.
defaultQ110 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default In terms of the alternatives that you mentioned to uplands—and I have a very large upland area—you mentioned livestock and forestry, and you also mentioned tourism and some others.  Tourism is quite important, but what contribution to food security would a nature reserve and some of the other things that you mentioned make as alternatives to livestock production on uplands?
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: In terms of issues to do with nature reserves, if one has an intensification of farming, so you grow more on the same amount of land, you have the scope to have reserves without affecting food security.  I think that that is one of the attractions of them.
defaultQ111 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default The last question: you last reported in 2011.  How much progress do you think the Government has made in meeting the challenges set out in your Foresight report?
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: When I left Government, I was delighted in the sense that both Defra and DFID had taken a lot of the report on.  I think it has had a lot of effect internationally.  To the extent that, when I was there, both successive Secretaries of States took on the issue from that report and said that this had become really important and brought it up the agenda, it has been very important.  There has been a change in emphasis; this is the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee.  Food is rather high up the agenda these days, compared with what might have been the Environment and Rural Affairs Committee if it had not happened.
defaultChair:default Professor Sir John, thank you very much indeed for being with us.
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: Thank you very much.
defaultChair:default You have been incredibly generous and very full in your answers, and we are very grateful to you.
defaultProfessor defaultBeddingtondefault: Thank you very much.
