"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the School of Law, University of Edinburgh (GHS0017)The \nSCRIPT Centre for IT and IP Law is an interdisciplinary research centre at the School of Law of the University of Edinburgh. Initially funded by the AHRC, it carries out research in the \nintersection \n between law, science and technology. \nSince its inception\n, it organises \n several “foresight fora” that \ntry\n to anticipate emerging legal issues in the fields of internet, IP and medical law. Its current director is Prof Burkhard Schafer, who also authored this response.  \nIn relation to autonomous vehicles and in\ntelligent transport infrastructure:\n&#xa0;\n \nWhat are (or were) the policy challenges presented by this technology? How have these challenges been identified?\n&#xa0;\nHow prepared is (or was) the Government to react to challenges presented by this techn\nology? How effective was this reaction?\n&#xa0;\n1) \nSummary:\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe legal and regulatory implications of autonomous vehicles are complex, multifaceted and range across a variety of legal fields. \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNeed for regulatory reform has been identified with varying degrees of \nurgency – some reform needed right now to enable the development\n and testing \n of the technology\n, other issues \n require\n medium to \n  long term strategies\n \nto enable production and uptake\n,\n also with \na view \n to\n amend \n international \ntreaties and coordinate inter\nnational \nstandards\n. \n \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSeveral legal issues will be outside the (full) control of th\ne\n UK government, raising international or devolved issues.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe legal \nreform \ndebate is most advanced in the US with regards to road traffic law/licensing, and in continental \nEurope with regards to liability regimes. The UK debate is comparatively \nmuted\n (but at a similar level to that in Japan)\n. \nReadiness for reform is difficult to gauge.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhis “wait and see” approach may well have beneficial aspects\n,\n as some of the discussion raises the danger of \n \nunnecessarily \nradical\n reform caused by the perceived, rather  than actual, novelty of the technologies, with limited understanding of their\n capabilities and \n limitations.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCourt –led \n“Incrementalism” might su\nit the common law approach to regulation better, but can \ncause\n tensions within the EU. \n \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI\nn some areas \nhowever, \naction will be needed soon. \nIn particular if we want cars that are “law abiding by design”, computer friendly clarification of road traffic law \nare needed.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe\n HORIZON project has had so far\n limited impact on that debate – its \noutcomes\n \nare potentially useful\n, but underused, for legal analysis. \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInformation flow in the opposite direction, contribution \nby\n \nlegal academics\n in the identification of fut\nure regulatory issues\n, and development of possible reform proposals, \nseems to be ver\ny limited.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI\nnternational studies\n and EU initiatives\n remain the main point of reference – problematic due to the national particularities of legal systems that make transfer\n of ideas in law more difficult than in the sciences.\n&#xa0;\n2) \nLegal issues \nand policy challenges \nof autonomous vehicles\n (A\nV\ns)\nThe legal challenges created by autonomous cars are many and multifaceted\n, ranging from \nobvious issues such as\n \nupdating the\n  \nRoad Traffic Act and Hig\nhway Code to the law of delict/tort\n, insurance law, criminal law, data protection law, RIPA, intellectual property law, competition law, contract law, disability law, criminal and civil procedural law and the law of ev\nidence, some of which involving international laws and treaties.  \nBefore attempting\n to give a \nlist, it is helpful to consider a few \nmore abstract \nparameters to structure these: \nLegal issues of autonomous \nvehicles \n can be caused by \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAntiquated laws preventing unintentionally the testing, development \nor uptake of\n ACs\n. This creates \nthe \npossible \nneed to legislate \nfor technology\n.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe technology can create new risks, including new forms of crime, that are not adequately covered by existing\n laws – the need for regulation \nof technology.\n \nTh\nis also includes debates on whether the mere perception of risk, e.g. by the wide\nr\n population or by insurance companies, merits to create legal reassurances \nthat are not objectively justified.\nEmerging legal\n issues of AVs can be\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSpecific to the car and the car industry (example \ne.g. the definition of \n “fitness to  drive”)\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGeneric  issues created by autonomous technologies (example: applicability of \nlegal \nterms such as\n \n \n“reasonable forseability”, “consent” or \n“malicious intent” to machines)\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nImported from other technological fields, e.g emerging legal issues of internet law that affect the communication of the car with a base station (example: possible data retention duties for car manufacturers/sellers)\nAs alwa\nys, legal issues can arise on the subnational (devolved), national and international including EU) level. \nFrom a UK perspective, this means that future pressures on the UK legal system  can be caused by\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDevelopments in the technology\n and the needs of the U\nK car manufacturers\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIndividual events that create pressure to act (\ne.g. \nan accident with fatalities)\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFuture reactions of international bodies and organisations to these developments\n \n over which the UK has some, but no full control (e.g.  changes to the \nGen\neva \n Convention; EU initiatives to prevent market fragmentation)\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nManufacturing  developments in other countries that affect \n UK law \nthrough the legal framework of the WTO (e.g. US car makers arguing that UK safety rules are a trade barrier\n, or that the abs\nence of a suitable legal framework is inherently a protectionist measure)\nFinally, the degree of legal changes \nthat is \nneeded will obviously depend \no\nn the degree of autonomy and the fun\nctionality embedded in the car – ranging from merely assistive technolo\ngies to self-driving cars with a human driver \n \n“in the loop” to the vision of the fully automated car \nthat like a chauffeur drops \nits owner \n off at \nhis \n destination and then drives itself home. \nLegal issues can combine \nissues across \nall of the above parameters, creating a large number of  very heterogeneous \nproblems\n, that make considerable demands on the expertise needed to address them. \nTo give some impression of the diversity of the issues that can come up, \n3\n examples\n, from opposing\n ends of the spectrum\n, all of which with uncertain legal answers and the \npotential\n need for law reform.\n \n1)\nA challenge at the WTO that UK regulation on the safety standards for \nAVs \nare unreasonable given the developments in technology and therefore discrim\ninate\n against US manufacturers\n. \n2) A driver is accused of murdering his wife with his car. The main evidence comes from 2 on\n-\n board sensors of the car, which operate independently, but whose inputs are processed by the same \ncentral \ncomputer\n unit on the ca\nr\n. Are these two piece\ns\n of evidence and the corroboration requirement of Scot criminal law is fulfilled, or is it a single piece of evidence that still needs corroborating?\n3) Due to a known bug in the car’s software, \na vulnerability\n is created that allows\n third parties to hack into a car’s computer system and steal personal information for fraudulent purposes. During a hack, the performance of the other software systems is degraded, and as a result the system reacted \ntoo \nslowly\n. \nThe driver\n, relying\n on his \nsoftware, \ndoes not\n intervene even if he could hav\ne. An accident follows\n. In the investigation it transpired that the security flaw was known, and that a patch existed, but that the driver had not updated his software for some time.\n The \n(US based) \ncar manuf\nacturer automatically updates software for some customers, but \no\nnly if they subscribe to a paid\n-\nfor premium service. \nB) \nspecific \n legal  issues\n.\nB.1) schematic overview of the legal issues of autonomous \nvehicles\nWhile this \nlist does not aspire to completeness, it lists the main \nissues that have come up in discussion so far. As discussed above, they can in varying degrees affect national , international or subnational legal regimes, and are affected in varying ways by the spe\ncific technology under consideration. \n1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRoad traffic law: \na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIssues  relating to the car itself (Roadworthiness, licensing etc)\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIssues relating to drivers (Duties of drivers, competent driver)\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIssues relating to third parties  \n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDelict\n/tort \n law and liability\n3)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nContract law \n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nContracts by manufacturer or  retailer with customer of automated car\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nContract automatically entered into   by the car\n4)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCriminal law\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNew forms of crimes “against” the automated car (e.g. hacking of software)\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNew forms of  crimes committed wit\nh automated cars\n5)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEvidence and procedure: digital evidence and computer forensics\n6)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nData protection law\n7)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInternet and computer law (e.g. Computer Misuse Act)\n8)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIP, competition and international trade law\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nISO standards\n9)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnvironmental and planning law\n10)\n&#xa0; \nInsurance law\n11)\n&#xa0; \nTax law\n12)\n&#xa0; \nDisability law \na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLinking back to 1: changing definition of competent driver\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n“digital divide” issues,\n possible \n right to assistive technology\nB.2) \nThis section very cursorily and mainly though examples expands on these 11 \ncategories\n.\n1) Road traffic law. \nThe UK recently permitted the testing of autonomous vehicles\n on public roads. This seems to  be an ad hoc permission granted on a case to case basis, which is similar to other such tests in Spain  and Japan.\n The US is already now taki\nng a more principled approach \nand some states issue licences for AVs\n. \n Emerging issues:\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGeneral rules on testing of the technology with a view on possible\n future \n \nlawful use on public roads – assurances to industry, telling them what they need to prove \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n fairness between competitors/\nno “hidden state subsidies” \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRevising outdated international regimes such as the 1949 Geneva Convention\nIf AVs become legal to drive on public roads, all relevant legislation will need updating, as recognised in the Action for\n Roads report by the DoT in 2013. Affected will be in \nparticular \n provisions that refer to relevant mental states such as “reasonable”, “\nforeseeable\n” or “intentionally”.  Example from the Road Traffic Act: \n “\nIf a person drives\n [...] \nwithout due care and at\ntention, or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road or place, he is guilty of an offence\n”\n. The meaning of “attention” might change if the car drives largely autonomously, and other activities presently permitted may become permiss\nible (e.g. taking a phone call). \nMore generally, h\now should the “reasonable consideration” be split between car and driver (and can cars ever said to be “reasonable”? The inverse question also needs \naddressing -\n under what conditions should it be prohibite\nd for a driver to override the computer?\nImportant social and regulatory questions concern the skills needed to drive an AV car, which will differ from traditional cars \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTransferability of “old” driver’s licenses?\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDriver licenses for people who in the past\n, due to disability or age, were excluded from the roads\n? If it can be shown that their risk would not be higher than that of a licensed driver at present in a traditional car, could withholding a license breach their  rights under the Disability Discrimin\nation Ac\nt, and possible HR law?\nWith “law compliance by design” emerging as a major approach to regulate information technologies (in particular, “privacy by design”) two important policy issues are raised here\n- clarification of the law in a way that it b\necomes “computational” as soon as possible will facilitate the construction of cars that are “traffic law abiding” by design\n- this raises however also the issue if, and if so to what degree, cars should be developed that \ncan\n break traffic laws – should we\n e.g. ever permit a fully autonomous car to ever be able to drive faster than the  speed limit?\n2) Liability (delict/tort)\nThis area has been the most studied, due to its obvious relevance for industry and car users.\n The main concern is a\n equitable\n distrib\nution of risks between manufacturer, retailer, drivers and pedestrians. \nFears that need to be addressed, though not necessarily through legislation, are\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nExcessive litigation could destroy the new industry in its infancy\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInsufficient legislation can create\n inadvertently “liability gaps”, depriving  victims of accidents of redress, or leaving drivers with liability for software faults outside their control. The latter in turn could negatively affect \nuptake, even if this were only the \n perception of risk. \nInsurance regimes will play an important role to manage these concerns, the role of the law here will be mainly to create sufficient predictability to establish rational insurance premiums in a competitive insurance market.  An interesting question here is\n what should be in\ns\nured in the future – the driver, the car or the car’s “mind”, the software that it uses. \nShould no claims bonuses follow the driver (even though his role is now minimal) or the car that has proven its reliability?\n3) contracts\nThere are \ntwo aspects \nof\n contract law in this field. One the one hand, contracts will be used by manufacturers and retailers to manage risks. Issues can arise if risk is shifted unfairly between the parties, raising also potential issues within Europe between jurisd\nictions t\nh\nat have sweeping “good faith” \ntests that\n can render void contractual agreements, and those that put greater burdens on the buyer. \n Liability and contract regimes for AV cars will evolve synchronously. If for instance producers are held liable for\n accidents caused by outdated software, they will write the right to “push” software updates automatically on their client’s cars. \nThe second issue are contracts that the car itself might automatically enter into- paying a road toll, accessing necessary b\nut paid-for services such as  GPS data, transmitting insurance details to another car after an accident, are a few possible examples. The legal validity of these computer generated contacts is discussed in the general law of robots and automated systems, b\nut will have a bearing on AVs as well\n4+5) criminal law and criminal procedure\nUndoubtedly, new crimes and security risks will become apparent once the technology is used more widely. The car can in this case become the target (e.g. by hacking into the computer system) or the means of new forms of crime. As with liability issues disc\nussed above, “omissions “ may play a much greater role than “actions”. Investigating AV crimes will require reliable digital evidence, and with that possible regulations that impose duties to store and collect this evidence in a forensically sound way (for\n instance in analogy to the “black box” in airplanes). This relates this topic to \n6+7) Data protection, internet  and computer law\nAVs will necessitate the collecting and processing of vast amounts of data, both on the car itself and in the infrastructure\n that supports it. Given how important the cars for many people, the ability to infer highly personal information from this data is ever present. \n Since this affects not just the car, but the entire intelligent infrastructure,” privacy by design” approache\ns are as necessary as data minimisation strategies. It is in this field that the author would see one of the most pressing and urgent needs for action. \nGenerally, ubiquitous computing poses new privacy challenges that current, internet focussed legislatio\nn may not adequately address\n. While some of the data will involve transmission via the internet, in particular in cloud based services (whose dangers of privacy have recently become \n \npainfully apparent) , other forms of data collection and processing do no\nt fit the internet paradigm. \nThis will also cause particular issues within the EU framework. National data protection regimes , despite the EU framework, differ  significantly, with privacy protection in the UK and Ireland considerably weaker than in many\n continental systems. With  cars inherently mobile and able to cross national borders, this can become a problem for interoperability, if e.g. German cars were to be prohibited from processing or storing certain data that they may need when driving in the \nUK.\nThe flipside of DP law are data retention duties and in the UK in particular RIPA, with open legal issues to what extend car manufacturers, retailers or owners become de facto  ISPs or so similar to ISPs that relevant legislation should be extended to \nthem .\n8) \n \nIP, competition and international trade law\nAs the example of data protection law above has shown, difference in national laws can result in design choices that \ncan \nimpact on the interoperability of cars and road systems. \nTraditional cars can dr\nive on pretty much any road – AV cars may need specific infrastructure to be able to drive. This can raise issues similar to the net neutrality debate- should we require that the infrastructure remains open to all car makers, or would it be permissible tha\nt say Google cars can only drive on Google maintained roads, or that their cars get at least preferential  treatment on roads where they provide infrastructure? \nThe much greater complexity that comes with an AV system will generally increase the danger of\n fragmented markets and interoperability. Standard setting, especially international standards, will be the obvious regularity means to address this, and will also have to play a significant role in determining liability issues alluded to above. This will \ninevitably raise legal issues regarding  \nstandard-essential patent\ns and licensing. On the one hand, inventors and developers of AV cars need to be rewarded through appropriate IP, on the other, market fragmentation in the transport infrastructure could be \nparticularly socially harmful\nLiterature\nGasseret Tom M. all BASt-Bericht F 83, Projektgruppe \"Rechtsfolgen zunehmender Fahrzeugautomatisierung\" 2012\nGraham, Kyle ‘Of Frightened Horses and Autonomous Vehicles: Tort Law and Its Assimilations of Innovations’\n Vol 52 Santa Clara Law Review (2012).\nKalra, Nidhi James Anderson and Martin Wachs, ‘Liability and Regulation of Autonomous Vehicle Technologies’ California PATH Research Report (2009) \nLeroux\n, Christophe\n et al \nSuggestion\n for a \ngreen paper\n on \nlegal issues\n in \nrobotics Report for Deliverable 2.3 of the \nEuropean Robotics Coordination Action 2012\nLeValley\n \n, \nDylan, ‘Autonomous Vehicle Liability – Application of Common Carrier Liability’ Vol 36(5) Seattle University Law Review (2013).\nSchafer,\n \nBurkhard, Wiebke Abel 'The German Constitutional Court on the Right in Confidentiality and Integrity of Information Technology Systems' (2009) \nSCRIPT-\ned\n pp106-123 \nVol\n 6\nSmith,  Bryant Walker \n“Automated vehicles are probably legal in the United States, Centre for internet and Society 2012, \nSvarcast\n \nFrancesca, ‘Turning a New Leaf: A Privacy Analysis of Carwings: Electric Vehicle Data Collection and Transmission’ 29 Santa Clara Computer &amp; High T\nechnology Law Journal 166 (2012). \nvan der Heijden Rob and Kiliaan van Wees, ‘Introducing Advanced Driver Assistance Systems: Some Legal Issues’ Vol 1(3) European Journal of Transport and Infrastructure Research (2001) 309-326.\nPinto\n,\n \nCyrus, ‘How Autonomou\ns Vehicle Policy in California and Nevada Addresses Technological and Non-Technological Liabilities’ Vol 5(1) Intersect – Stanford University (2012). \nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
