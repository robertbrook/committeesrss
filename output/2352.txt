[[[Renfrewshire Council ]]]1.1.               Renfrewshire Council continues to express concerns that the reforms to support for               housing costs being considered by this inquiry will exacerbate poverty for the most               vulnerable individuals and families. 1.2.               The Renfrewshire area includes the Ferguslie area of Paisley, the single most deprived               datazone in Scotland (see the Renfrewshire context - Appendix 1, A). This area and               other more vulnerable communities in Renfrewshire already face significant challenges               and the measures being introduced by the UK Government will lead to increased               financial stress for households and create additional service pressures arising from               demand for welfare, debt and money advice, additional family distress and increased               homelessness presentations.1.3.               From the Council’s perspective there are clear financial risks relating to the               management and sustainability of the Housing Revenue Account (HRA). These are               linked to increases in rent collection costs and bad debts associated with an increasing               requirement to collect rent as a result of reducing benefit levels available to tenants and               proposals for housing benefit payments to be made directly to the claimant under the               proposed Universal Credit system.1.4.               Additionally, the Council is concerned that the make up and availability of housing stock               at local authority level does not appear to have been taken into account when               introducing the under occupancy reduction. (Appendix 1, B) refers. This places               significant challenges for social landlords, including Renfrewshire Council where there               is a mismatch between the housing requirements of tenants affected by the under               occupancy reduction and the benefit cap and the availability of suitably sized stock. 1.5.               Renfrewshire Council anticipates a number of potential impacts on its statutory duty in               relation to homelessness as a result of the Housing Benefit changes. In particular, the               application of the under occupancy reduction to local authority owned stock used to               temporarily accommodate people presenting as homeless, while exempting other               tenures of property used, does not recognise the effective use that is made of LA               owned accommodation to meet such emergency accommodation needs.  The loss of               housing benefit and the resulting increase in rent arrears may ultimately lead to               increased housing benefit costs as the council may be forced to consider greater use of               the private sector provision, where rent levels may prove to be higher, in order to meet               its statutory duties in relation to homelessness and protect against financial loss to the               Council. 1.6.               The proposed introduction of direct payment of housing costs within Universal Credit is               expected to lead to greater financial stress for households and individuals and will place               extreme financial pressures on the long term sustainability of social housing where               households are unable to budget appropriately and manage the ongoing responsibility               of sustaining their rent payments.2.1.               Renfrewshire Council has deployed significant additional resources of £1.3 million in               2013/14 and beyond to provide the Council with the best opportunity to prepare for and               manage the anticipated increase in demand for services. Much of this investment is               directed towards advice and support to ensure the Council is well placed to both               support the tenants and their families manage the impact of welfare change, but also to               seek to pro-actively protect the financial position of the Council’s housing function, in               particular the sustainability of its rental stream during this transition.2.2.               Renfrewshire Council has formally recognised that where tenants subject to the under               occupancy reduction are actively engaged with the Council and are taking reasonable               steps to maintain a rent repayment arrangement the council will continue to pursue rent               due without resorting to eviction. However, it needs to be recognised that increasing               rental arrears ultimately places significant financial pressures on the Council’s Housing               Revenue Account which will in turn increase the associated future rental costs for social               housing within Renfrewshire. 2.3.               In recognition of this, the Council has in addition,  agreed to set aside £850,000 from               the Housing Revenue Account (HRA) for 2013/14 to help mitigate the impacts of               welfare reform on Council tenants, part of which will be targeted at providing a scheme               of financial support for tenants experiencing hardship. Given the close links with the               Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) Discretionary Housing Payment (DHP)               scheme, options for criteria for the HRA financial hardship support scheme are being               developed taking account of the circumstances and outcomes of applications made by               tenants for DHP. However, it is recognised that both schemes will provide only               temporary support and relief for affected tenants.2.4.               In addition, Renfrewshire Council has increased its top up funding to DHP resources by               150% by allocating an additional £150,000 to the DHP fund for 2013/14 in recognition               that the DWP resources are insufficient to provide the necessary short term support to               affected citizens across Renfrewshire. The Council administration is proposing to               further enhance the fund up to the maximum allowable at the Council meeting               scheduled for 3 October 2013. The enhanced fund will help defray the loss of               Housing Benefit and provide tenants with short term support that will allow them to               meet their rent obligations while considering other options.2.5.               The integration of housing officers to neighbourhood area housing teams has also been               taken forward by the Council in order to support ongoing tenancy management               activities. Officers continue to take proactive measures to support tenants affected and               we have increased the number of officers available to offer advice and assistance,               including specialist money advice to make sure that tenants have access to good               advice and support.  This includes maximising any opportunity to access benefit               entitlement, support access to any possible financial support funds in place, and also               covers repayment planning and referral to training and employment services. 2.6.               Interest in Mutual Exchanges has increased and good progress is being made in               partnership with Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) to develop a Housing Options               shop which is scheduled to be operational during October 2013. The focus will be on               supporting and facilitating exchanges where tenants have expressed and interest in               this.2.7.               Invest in Renfrewshire is the Council’s flagship programme to tackle unemployment and               improve employability with in Renfrewshire. This programme               supported a Welfare               Reform training programme within Housing Services for young people between the               ages of 16 and 25. The programme funded the recruitment and supported the training               of a team of unemployed to support the initial phases of the contact with tenants               affected by the under occupancy reduction, a second programme is currently underway               with the team focusing on a wider group of council tenants and their households.  The               first programme resulted in all but one of the young participants progressing to               employment or further education.2.8.               Housing options advice has been extended to include employment sign posting and               relevant housing staff have been trained and plans are being progressed to deploy an               employment adviser dedicated to support unemployed tenants.  3.1.               Both local authority and RSL housing stock is in significant demand as evidenced by               the waiting lists, owner occupation is very difficult to access at present due to high               purchase prices, the requirement for large deposits and the lack of availability of               mortgage finance. The Council is already aware that tenants impacted are Housing               Benefit claimants and this is unlikely to be an option available to them. 3.2.               In Renfrewshire a Housing Options approach is in place; as part of housing advice               services, tenants and applicants are given an overview of all housing options available               to them, including discussions around alternative tenures including the private rented               sector.3.3.               The private rented sector is relatively smaller compared to other tenures and wider               welfare reforms will also make this sector more difficult to access. Tenants leaving their               current homes may end up staying with family or friends or present as homeless putting               greater pressure on existing services.3.4.               Shelter Scotland, have indicated that people judged to be under-occupying in the social               sector and who can't afford the shortfall, will be forced with the choice to downsize or               run up arrears. Due to the widely recognised chronic shortage of one-bedroom social               houses, the charity says many will have to turn to the private rented sector. In               Renfrewshire the existence of the required number of one bed room private rented               properties is questionable.3.5.               As highlighted in tables 1 and 2 in Appendix 1, rent for a one-bedroom property in the               private sector is on average higher than rent for a two-bedroom social property.               Tenants electing to transition to a private tenancy as means to alleviate the impact of               under occupancy rules on a social tenancy, would qualify for full Local Housing               Allowance (LHA) as they would no longer be assessed as under-occupying –               perversely this would be costing the public purse more in terms of providing housing               costs support than it would to provide full benefit support for a social rented property               without any associated under occupancy reduction.

[[[Under occupancy reduction]]]4.1.               The removal of the spare room subsidy, or the bedroom tax, as it is more commonly               known, has introduced deductions from housing benefit on tenants who are deemed to               have more bedrooms than they need. As referred to earlier, options for tenants in               this situation are limited as the housing stock in the area does not match the associated               demand for smaller one bedroom properties and with many affected tenants advising               the Council that they  have no way of making up the shortfall. 4.2.               At the point of implementation of the under occupancy reduction, a total of 1,960               Council tenants lost £1.2 million a year in housing benefit (as detailed in table 3,               Appendix 1) and 1,100 Housing Association tenants lost £0.6 million a year in housing               benefit. It is anticipated that a major component of this loss in benefit will lead to a               reduction in rental income for both the Council and Registered Social Landlords (RSLs). 4.3.               Based on data from the end of July 2013, July the number of tenants affected by Under               Occupancy and in arrears has risen to 1,464, with only 27% of households affected               maintaining a clear rent account. The increase in rent arrears since the start of the               financial year and introduction of the under occupancy reduction is £229,000. This is               despite the proactive attempts of the Council to inform and support tenants through the               changes and places significant financial risks on the potential to recover unpaid rent               going forward.4.4.               The 2013/14 HRA Business Plan includes an anticipated increase in the level of                             budgeted bad debt provision from 2.5% to 3.5% (c£400k increase) and 5% (c£600k               increase) thereafter. In addition, previously anticipated staffing savings of £300k in               2015/16 and £200k in 2016/17 have been removed from the HRA Business Plan to               reflect the anticipation of increasing service pressures to support tenants and address               growing rental arrears. In addition to this, further budgeted resources  of £331,000 per               annum have also been built in for 2013/14 and moving forward to provide the               necessary staffing resources that are anticipated, as best can be at this point,  to be               required to provide these additional services and manage the additional service               pressures. Any increased costs or reduction in income for 2014/15 to 2017/18 will be               built into future Business Plans once increasing certainty is established over the               emerging impact of the under occupancy reduction and the wider reform agenda. 4.5.               Housing Benefit paid to tenants in the private rented sector is based on Local Housing               Allowance (LHA) rates. The LHA rates in Renfrewshire are higher for all property sizes               than in the social rented sector. As referred to above, it is anticipated that a counter-              productive consequence of the under occupancy rules will see some  tenants under               occupying in the social sector, electing  to move to the private sector and receive an               increased amount of housing benefit for a smaller sized property. 4.6.               Renfrewshire Council also expects a number of possible impacts on homelessness               generally which are anticipated to emerge as a direct result of the HB changes. These               include pressure on the proportion of lets to homeless applicants due to an increase in               transfer requests from existing tenants in receipt of housing benefit who are under-              occupying their homes - this may in turn lead to an increase in the length of time taken               to complete the local authorities duty to house those who are unintentionally homeless,               and an increase in the need to provide (and fund) temporary accommodation – it should               be noted that even those who are deemed to be intentionally homeless can require to               be provided with temporary accommodation.4.7.               Renfrewshire Council has always recognised the housing circumstances of Council               tenants and tenants seeking to transfer are given a proportion of available lets within               the current allocation policy. The Council is continuing to take a flexible approach in               consideration of mutual exchange applications to accommodate those tenants impacted               by the under-              occupancy rules.

[[[Benefit cap]]]4.8.               While numbers affected by the benefit cap within Renfrewshire are low (29), for the               affected larger families this poses significant concern. The annual reduction in housing               benefit paid to these households is currently estimated as £106,384. Input from DWP               and other agencies, including the Council will be required to provide support to the               families in relation to employability and housing options.

[[[Support and Exempt accommo]]]

[[[dation]]]4.9.               Discussions have commenced with the Council’s commissioned housing support               providers to look at current service specifications; current housing support provision;               current housing management provision to determine what changes need to be               considered when developing new tenders for these commissioned services.  In the               future housing support and housing management must be much more clearly aligned               within service contracts to ensure supported accommodation projects are sustainable.               While the DWP has indicated that they wish to better understand the supported housing               sector and the impact of housing benefit in the sector in order to protect existing               provision from the unintended consequences of welfare reform, until this work is               concluded risks remain in relation to supported housing provision.

[[[Temporary Accommodation]]]4.10.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Under occupancy restrictions are being placed on HB recipients placed in Council               owned temporary accommodation. This is not the case where tenants are placed in               privately sourced/leased accommodation used for this purpose. In Renfrewshire 88% or               147 out of 167 properties used to house people presenting as homeless are council               owned therefore this potentially places an additional burden. The majority of               households living in temporary accommodation receive housing benefit and are placed               in accommodation arising from an urgent need rather than a strict adherence to size               criteria. By the end of July 2013 arrears of approximately £27,000 of under occupancy               arrears had accumulated.4.11.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Renfrewshire Council recognises its duty to minimise homelessness and protect the               vulnerable. In the short term, the impact of the HB reduction will in effect create a               benefit gap which is not being passed on to homeless people temporarily lodged in               accommodation. This is a new burden and a form of cost shunting from the DWP to               local authorities which has the direct impact of diverting already stretched Council               resources away from other priority areas in order for the Council to protect the most               vulnerable of clients from what is seen as an unintended consequence of welfare               changes. However, it is recognised that this action taken by the Council will not be               sustainable in the long term and addressing this unintended and unfair consequence of               the reforms on the most vulnerable of individuals is something which the Council               continues to lobby the DWP for through a range of routes.4.12.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In addition, it is intended that housing costs for short stay tenants will be included in               Universal Credit at LHA rates and paid direct to tenants. There will also be a               management element, or overhead, however the method to be applied has yet to be               determined. The Council has significant concerns over the underlying logic of this               approach which is expected to place significant pressure on already extremely               vulnerable clients and it is fully anticipated that a very high level of non payment of               associated rent will occur as a consequence. An estimated non-recovery of £482,000 in               annual rental income relating to the direct payment of the Housing Benefit element to               short stay tenants through Universal Credit is expected to have an impact on the               Council’s ability to provide Short Stay, temporary accommodation.4.13.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Work is ongoing to look at the current modelling of temporary and supported               accommodation to determine the future viability of the current model of service delivery,               which at present proves to be highly effective at meeting the immediate needs of               vulnerable individuals and families. The Council is also looking at developing other               options within the private sector to ensure single households have sustainable and               affordable temporary housing options in accommodation that is the correct size and               meets their needs. The Council is currently carrying out scoping exercises of empty               buildings and cost analysis on buildings that could potentially meet the Council’s               requirements moving forward. However, it is recognised that such potential re-              modelling of service delivery comes with the risk that what is subsequently put in place               fails to deliver an equivalent level of service, impacting once again on some of the most               vulnerable in our society.

[[[LHA changes ]]]4.14.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; During 2012/13 the Council supplemented the DHP fund by giving a total of £168,000               and over the last year Renfrewshire Council actively supported private sector tenants               impacted by the LHA changes. Tenants were contacted and invited to apply for a               Discretionary Housing Payment as a means of providing short term support to allow               them time to consider their options or seek alternative accommodation. Overall               £104,000 was awarded to tenants in private rented accommodation with £26,000 of this               arising from the direct contact made by council staff to tenants affected by the LHA               changes. The Council continues to support these customers however with the scale of               the changes for social sector tenants the DHP fund is expected to be under significant               pressure as the year progresses therefore it is anticipated that there will be less scope               to provide a similar level of assistance to affected tenants.

[[[Changes to non dependant deductions]]]4.15.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Council recognises that non dependent adults living in a property are expected to               make a contribution to housing costs, based on income. The increase in non dependant               deductions over the last two years places additional pressures on landlords in collecting               the balance due from non dependants and with the introduction of the under occupancy               means that the presence of a non dependant can lead to the need for detailed benefit               advice. Households with non dependants have been beneficiaries of DHP payments               over the last year.5.1.               Discretionary Housing Payments (DHP) provide claimants with additional financial               assistance with housing costs, in addition to any welfare benefits, where a local               authority considers that further help is required. The DWP allocate the fund to councils               and councils can, under the legislation, consider adding to this fund up to a maximum of               2.5 times the DWP allocation. In short to medium term a DHP award is likely to be one               of a limited number of options open to support tenants.  5.2.               The UK Government increased the overall DHP fund to help mitigate some of the short               to medium term impact of the Housing Benefit changes. The Renfrewshire allocation               has increased from £74,464 in 2012/13 to £267,351 in 2013/14. The DWP has advised               that this increased level of discretionary funding is to be targeted at mitigating the               impact of the under occupancy reduction, the benefit cap and the impact on temporary               accommodation after the introduction of Universal Credit. 5.3.               In the last two financial years the Council has approved additional top up DHP funding               of £60,000 in each year. The UK Government allocations were £52,314 in 2011/12 and               £74,464 for 2012/13. 5.4.               In addition to the DWP allocation for 2013/14 of £267,351 the Council has approved               additional top up support for the DHP fund by £150,000 (150% of previous year) from               its own resources bringing the total support available to £417,351 to provide tenants               with short term support that will allow them to meet their rent obligations while               considering other options. While the Council took this necessary step it is recognised               that this will not address the loss of benefit of £1.8 million across all housing providers               in relation to the under occupancy alone. There is a proposal going to the Council               meeting on 3 October 2013 to bring the Council’s contribution up to the maximum               allowable.5.5.               Data on DHP awards since April 2013 highlight that 85% of the awards are being made               to tenants affected by the under occupancy reduction, with households unable to move               for health reasons and families where an extra room is required for access to children               benefiting most.6.1.               Renfrewshire Council would like to take the opportunity to draw the Work and Pensions               Committee’s attention to another significantly concerning aspect of the UK Government               welfare changes linked to the introduction of Universal Credit – direct payments. The               Council view this proposal as the biggest single financial risk to the long term               sustainability of housing services within Renfrewshire. It breaks the existing               arrangement of housing benefit support being paid direct to the landlord and places               responsibility on individual tenants to manage their overall finances and sustain on an               ongoing basis payment of their rent. It is the Council’s view that although many tenants               will, with appropriate support from the Council, transition to this new arrangement, a               large number will struggle which will inevitably lead to a significant increase in rent               arrears, placing increased financial pressures on social landlords and longer term rental               levels. 6.2.               Emerging findings from the DWP Demonstration projects highlights the increase in the               level of non payment of rent and where rental income is being recovered, this is at a               significant cost to the social landlords involved – a cost that DWP do not at this stage               appear willing to support. Given the limitations of the demonstration projects concerns               remain over the long term impact of direct payment and the cost of supporting tenants               to make payment and the impact on household incomes and social landlord revenue               streams where conflicts arise. Using Council data, if 10% of tenants do not pay rent the               loss of rent income per year will amount to £2.6 million a year and this loss rises to £5.2               million if non payment rises to 20%. 6.3.               Projected losses in rental income of this order will cause significant challenges in               relation to the funding of maintenance programmes and long term investment in               housing provision. The Council and social landlords in general will be required to review               the affordability of existing funding streams and consider the impact on rent levels for all               tenants as a consequence of the significant financial pressures that are anticipated.7.1.               Responsibility and funding for CT support transferred to the Scottish Government and               the Council tax Reduction scheme developed in Scotland broadly mirrors the previous               Council Tax Benefit scheme. As the scheme transferred to the Scottish Government               less 10% of the funding, the Scottish Government and COSLA agreed to fund the               difference for 2013/14. This transitional arrangement means that recipients of the new               Council Tax Reduction have not seen any change in the level of support they receive.               Discussions are being progressed between Scottish Ministers and COSLA in relation               the longer term funding and the impact of funding decisions on the shape and operation               of the scheme.8.1.               Renfrewshire Council has developed and implemented a wide ranging corporate wide               programme of work to ensure the Council is effectively mobilised and plans to manage               as far as possible the impact of the welfare reform changes. 8.2.               Programme activities through 2012/13 have focused on raising awareness of the               changes and engaging directly with those affected, in particular with tenants. A               corporate training programme has been developed and delivered to staff and               communications tools such as video and a range of print materials have been               developed and shared with partner organisations across Renfrewshire. The Council               and partner RSLs have engaged directly with tenants with 85% (1662) of council               tenants receiving direct contact prior to 1 April 2013. 8.3.               To further recognise the needs of tenants, Renfrewshire Council has approved               proposals to reclassify a property where it can be evidenced that a bedroom is stated               as being required to meet disability or medical needs, and no other suitable alternative               is available and amendments to the allocations policy to enhance exchange options.8.4.               In addition to supplementing the DHP funding outlined at paragraph 5.4 the Council has               approved £1.3 million in additional resources for 2013/14 to support tenants and               citizens affected by the welfare changes, including the Housing Benefit changes. This               has resulted in the deployment of a 45 strong team across a range of services,               including Housing Services, Advice Services and the Benefits Service to provide help               and support.8.5.               Welfare reform represents a major financial risk to the Council Housing Revenue               account (HRA) over the medium term as a range of welfare changes take effect over               this period. The Council has planned for and responded to predicted increases in               customer demands, needs and also to pro-actively protect the financial position of the               HRA. Resources involved in rent collection have increased as part of proactive               measures outlined earlier. Twelve temporary posts were funded by the Housing               Revenue Account at a cost of £0.080 million in 2012/13 with a full year recurring cost of               £0.331 million moving into 2013/14 to supplement existing resources in Housing               Services. The underlying objective of this investment is to both, support the tenants and               their families manage the change but also to seek to pro-actively protect the HRA rental               stream during this transition. 8.6.               The Council’s Benefit Service is proactively managing requests for review and disputes               in relation to application of the under occupancy reduction in accordance with the               Housing Benefit legislation and guidance. When additional information is provided by               the customer that supports removal of the reduction, the housing benefit decision is               revised. Where the decision upheld, a submission is prepared and submitted to HM               Courts and Tribunal Service for consideration.8.7.               A welfare reform summit was held in Renfrewshire in December targeting support and               awareness at Third sector organisations operating in Renfrewshire and the Council has               recently supported a Third Sector Welfare Reform event led by the Third sector               interface organisation in Renfrewshire. Further events are planned. 8.8.               An Employability Conference was held in June 2013 targeting employability and               business development practitioners from across Renfrewshire. Information on Welfare               Reform was shared and the discussions will shape future direction and partnership               working.9.1.               Renfrewshire Council is willing to present oral evidence to the Work and Pensions               Committee in relation to this inquiry into the provision of support to meet housing cost in               the reformed welfare system.

[[[&#xa0;]]]The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD), the Scottish Government’s official tool for identifying those places in Scotland suffering from deprivation, published in 2012 notes that Renfrewshire’s overall share of the number of datazones showing the worst deprivation in Scotland has increased and the single overall most deprived datazone in Scotland is located in Ferguslie, Paisley. In SIMD 2012, 14.7% of Renfrewshire’s population (25,030 people) is income deprived, compared to a Scotland average of 13.4%. In terms of employment deprivation, 15% of working age Renfrewshire residents (16,070) are employment deprived, compared to 12.8% in Scotland as a whole. Between SIMD 2009 and SIMD 2012, Renfrewshire had the largest increase in the percentage of working age people who are employment deprived (2.4%). Renfrewshire has the 7th largest share in terms of the 15% most deprived areas in Scotland.There are approximately 75,000 households in Renfrewshire. 34% of Renfrewshire households rent their home in the social rented sector. Renfrewshire Council is a social landlord and retains 12,540 council houses with 68% of the households receiving Housing Benefit to assist them with meeting their housing costs. There are also approximately 7200 social rented properties managed by Registered Social landlords in the Renfrewshire area, with 69% receiving Housing Benefit.The number of households renting in the private rented sector in Renfrewshire is estimated at 8,200. Of these around 3,400 receive Housing Benefit (LHA).17,311 households in Renfrewshire were in receipt of Housing Benefit, totalling £63.8 Million as at 31 March 2013.
