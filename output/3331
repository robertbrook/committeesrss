[normal]IPCC 
[normal]AR5 
[normal]is unashamedly presented, not as the outcome of scientific observation, but as a compilation of 
[normal]the
[normal] opinions
[normal] of a close community of experts
[normal]. This is made abundantly clear in 
[normal]Section 
[normal]A Introduction paragraph 3.
[normal] As the unadulterated facts of the matter are
[normal] not available, this invites, indeed demands, 
[normal]criticism ad hominem.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Thus, i
[normal]t is legitimate
[normal], indeed essential,
[normal] to examine the nature of the experience and learning of those pu
[normal]rporting to be expert in this methodology
[normal] and to expose them to criticism 
[normal]by examining the following 
[normal]issues
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] (a) This is a new discipline and few have been able to accumulate sufficient experience to qualify them as ‘experts’.
[normal] What is an expert climatolo
[normal]gist?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal](b) Climatologists form a closely-knit peer group that shares an interest in promoting public alarm and provoking continued research.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal](c) 
[normal]It may be that, centred on UEA, several climatologists may be political activists who share a belief in 
[normal]‘
[normal]p
[normal]ost-normal science
[normal]’
[normal] which sees ‘scientific research’ not as a search for ‘truth’, but as a vehicle for the achievement of personal and collective 
[normal]goals
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] (d) 
[normal]Climatology is in effect a subset of the ‘Futurology’
[normal] and cannot be subjected to the test of fal
[normal]sification until after the future has been experienced. Thus it is crucial to discover why so many of 
[normal]the 
[normal]IPCC 
[normal]models failed to anticipate the stability of the
[normal] climate over the past 15 years. AR5 offers 
[normal]several 
[normal]hypotheses about variables that were not exam
[normal]ined adequately in the models. No credence can be given 
[normal]to
[normal] su
[normal]c
[normal]h 
[normal]excuses unless and until there is evidence to support them 
[normal]but
[normal] asking for more evidence promotes the expenditure of more public money in pursuit of a research methodology so dependent on exper
[normal]tise as 
[normal]it may b
[normal] fatally flawed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] (e) 
[normal]Throughout the papers great emp
[normal]hasis has been placed on trends from 
[normal]the past
[normal] to the present and the inference is that these will continue unabated indefinitely.
[normal] But the future need not be like the past and 
[normal]in the instance of a highly complex and non-linear systems extrapolations from past trends are more likely as not to be misleading. 
[normal]A point to this effect as made in AR1.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] (f) The definition of ‘climate scientist’ as one who believes that there is AGW and
[normal] who engages in research, not to seek the causal relations that give rise to the phenomenon but engages in research about 
[normal]its
[normal] 
[normal]effect, rather than its causes precludes dissent about the founding hypothesis – that catastrophic global warming is taking place 
[normal]as a result of human activity. So ‘all true climate scientist agree’ and those who dissent are not climate scientists.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] (g) Despite previous assessments providing the opinion that ever increasing temperatures were on the way, AR5 reverts to a prognosis si
[normal]milar to that of the First Assessment. Surely this must mean that there is less cause for alarm.
