[[[December 2013]]]8 For example, a report from the Revolving Doors Agency (Revolving Doors Agency (2013) First Generation: One Year On – available at http://www.revolving-doors.org.uk/documents/first-generation-one-year-on/) welcomes efforts by some PCCs to seek “lasting systemic change through partnership” with a view to reducing crime and improving wellbeing in their areas. For example, a recent opinion poll found that 64% of people think that PCCs have made no difference to the police’s effectiveness at combating crime (3% thought PCCs had made the police more effective, 9% less effective and 25% did not know). Poll results available at http://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/jwnzb06i31/YG-Archive-131112-TimesPCCs.pdf p.82: Independent Police Commission (2013) Policing for a Better Britain: Report of the Independent Police Commission – available at http://independentpolicecommission.org.uk/uploads/37d80308-be23-9684-054d-e4958bb9d518.pdf House of Commons Home Affairs Committee (2013) Police and Crime Commissioners: Power to remove Chief Constables, Sixth Report of Session 2013-14, London: The Stationery Office Limited.http://www.police-foundation.org.uk/news/93/22/Tom-Winsor-gives-the-Foundation-s-John-Harris-Lecture/d,News-mainhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24148129http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2516121/Crackdown-police-chiefs-luxury-cars-tax-break.html and see for example http://www.northyorkshire-pcc.gov.uk/taking-action/making-decisions/decisions-made/0812013-review-of-chief-police-officer-remuneration-terms-and-conditions/http://www.thamesvalley-pcc.gov.uk/Document-Library/Letter-to-council-leaders-11-11-13.pdf At present, at least one PCP (in West Yorkshire) receives additional funding from local sources while others rely solely on the funding provided by the Home Office. See, for example, http://www.westmidlands-pcc.gov.uk/consultation/budget-and-precept-2014-15 and http://www.sussex-pcc.gov.uk/precept-consultation/ Poll results available at http://thecentreground.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Centreground-Results-131108-Police-RESULTS.pdf Their annual report on police funding stated that: “HMIC is deeply disappointed with progress on collaboration … the pace of change on collaboration is too slow” (HMIC (2013) Policing in Austerity: Rising to the Challenge, London: HMIC).Gilmore, M. (2013) ‘Police and Crime Commissioners One Year On’ in The RUSI Journal, 158: 5, p.48-55. For example, five forces in the South West of England have agreed to pursue a new regional forensic services collaboration (http://www.avonandsomerset-pcc.gov.uk/News-and-Events/News-Archive/2013/November/South-West-Forces-agree-Regional-Forensic-Collaboration.aspx), while collaboration between Sussex and Surrey police forces was extended from 1st October 2013. This was recently recognised in a collaboration agreement between Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire – for details see http://www.bedfordshire.pcc.police.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/105-Collaboration-expansion-Dec-13.pdfGilmore, M.
