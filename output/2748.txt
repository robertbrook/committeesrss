[[[&#xa0;]]]Written evidence from the Confederation of Passenger Transport UK (CPT) (WRT 004)

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;The Confederation of Passenger Transport UK (CPT) welcomes the opportunity to provide evidence to the Transport Select Committee for their inquiry into winter resilience in transport. CPT would be happy to provide further information if it would assist the Committee.  

[[[&#xa0;]]]Following the inclement winter of 2009/10 where substantial parts of the country failed to cope with the pressures the extreme weather placed upon it CPT participated in and provided evidence to the DfT report led by David Quarmby and also the report conducted by the Local Government Association.  Our evidence showed that where the Highways Agency and local authority highways departments had worked in partnership to plan a coordinated response to decide what level of bus services could be provided, and concentrated on delivering that plan, bus services in those areas were better than where they had been no coordination and a rather haphazard response by local authorities and their road gritting teams. There is now an acknowledgement that roads around bus depots need to be part of the priority gritting routes if bus services are to be maintained even when the depots are located in industrial estates and away from main roads.&#xa0;Since then CPT has asked a number of its members across the country whether there has been any improvement in communications between the local authorities and the bus companies to draw up winter resilience plans to decide how both parties will react should snow and ice develop on the local bus network. The responses have been mixed across the country.  For example, Northumbria and Arriva now meet more regularly to decide what bus routes they will try to keep operational in a priority order, whereas in Derby and Derbyshire bus routes have dropped off the priority roads list. The position in Bristol has improved dramatically. Bristol City Council and First have agreed on the main roads and bus routes the council will treat as priority routes for gritting and this plan is scheduled for review each October. &#xa0;The bus companies have also made a number of changes with many now geared up to getting the latest information out to customers through their websites, social media, local radio etc.&#xa0;There is general concern that this winter, due to budgetary constraints, local authorities may not be able to provide the level of gritting services they have in previous years and that this may impair the ability of bus companies to provide the same levels of services. The position, of course, will not be known unless and until extreme weather arrives this winter.  However, CPT expects that at the very least the dialogue on winter resilience plans will continue between local authorities and the bus companies even if only a very limited response is available by the local authority.&#xa0;&#xa0;October 2013
