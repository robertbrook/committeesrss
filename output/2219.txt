[[[Trevor and Josephine Wright – Written evidence]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;My wife and I expressly  support the formal submissions made by The Green Lanes Environmental Action Group (GLEAM),  The Green Lanes Protection Group (GLPG),   The Peak District Green Lanes Alliance and Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance.&#xa0;We have been hiking and enjoying  the peace and tranquillity of the countryside for over fifty years. In recent years, however, we have seen a distinct decline in the condition of the ancient unsurfaced tracks in our area which is the Yorkshire Dales, Yorkshire Wolds and the Peak District.    This has been entirely due to increased  use of recreational vehicles ie. 4 x 4s and off-road motorbikes.  The evidence for this is that, where Traffic Regulation Orders had been imposed  by Yorkshire Dales National  Park Authority, the surface of the lanes had improved markedly.               However  there are still a large .number of these green lanes which are badly affected.   As the budgets to the National  Parks have been cut it has become difficult for them to attempt to impose TROs as they are complex  and very expensive.&#xa0;We are badly affected by this situation as being of pensionable age and mobility  problems, we find negotiating stiles difficult;  indeed my wife, due to balance problems, fell off a stile last year and badly broke her leg!   Not wanting to give up walking,  bridleways and UCRs should be a safe alternative  for us as they are gated and without  stiles. Unfortunately these are the very lanes that recreational off-road vehicles target for use and consequently the surface  becomes increasingly difficult for us to negotiate  in places due to the deep ruts caused by them.   This situation  also prevails for other disadvantaged walkers with health problems,  and also horse riders and mountain bikers.&#xa0;Clearly off-road vehicle use is not appropriate to the intended  spirit of our National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty.   In these austere times the general public would be shocked to know just how much money is spent on repairing  green lanes and UCRs when they are told there is not enough  money available to repair the every-increasing number of potholes  in our public roads.&#xa0;Attached  are pictures (Deadman's Hill, Nidderdale) illustrating just what damaged is caused by recreational off-road vehicles  and why we are supporting the submissions as mentioned above.&#xa0;Yours faithfully·&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Trevor and Josephine  Wright&#xa0;
