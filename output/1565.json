"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Hhic And Hwa (HOT12) &#xa0;&#xa0;Introduction&#xa0;\nThe Heating and Hotwater Industry Council (HHIC) and the Hot\n W\nater Association (HWA) welcome the opportunity to respond to the Energy\n and Cli\nmate Change Select Committee’s Inquiry into H\neat.  HHIC and HWA \nare trade associations \nwork\ning\n together under the umbrella of t\nhe Energy &amp; Utilities Alliance to provide \nwidespread\n representation of the domestic heating \nand hot water \nindustry\n which \nis worth \n£3-4 billion\n.  \n&#xa0;\nHHIC members include manufacturers, merchants and installers of all types of heating products including traditional fossil fuel boilers, microCHP\n, heat pumps, biomass boilers and solar water heaters. HWA represents manufacturers of hot water storage products. \n93-95% of heating and hot water solutions in the UK are covered by HHIC’s and HWA’s membership.\n&#xa0;\nWe would be happy to discuss any of the issu\nes rais\ned in this response and in the I\nnquiry with the Select Committee. \n&#xa0;Executive Summary &#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;*******************&#xa0;1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOpportunities and barriers facing the uptake of low carbon heating in UK homes&#xa0;1.1\n \nHHIC and HWA \nsupport\n \nthe need to \nreduce carbon emissions in order to \nhelp \ncombat climate change and to establish longer term energy \nsecurity\n.\n \nAt the same time we recognise the \nongoing \nneed \nto provide affordable an\nd effec\ntive heating for UK households along\n with the implications and needs to alleviate fuel poverty\n.\n1.2\n \nReducing the amoun\nt of carbon used for heating \nUK homes is a significant \nchallenge and \nprogress has been relatively slow. There are a number\n of\n factors which \nare \nli\nmit\ni\nng\n the pace of decarbonisation.\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n \nFaced with all of these issues it would be easy \nto focus the decarbonisation agenda \non other market sectors. Heating and hot\n water \nare together\n responsible for \nover 80 % of the domestic sectors energy consumption\n and\n 27%\n of\n the UK’s\n carbon emissions and so cannot be ignored \nif \nthe 2030 and 2050 \nambitions\n are to be achieved.\n1.4\n \nThe inquiry ra\nises a number of \ncritic\nal questions about the opportunities and challenges to reduce carbon emissions from domestic heating. HHIC has prod\nuced a report entitled Pathways \nto Domestic Heating which provides some new and alternative options to reduce the carb\non intensity of domestic heating and in doing so addresses a number of questions raised in the Inquiry.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPathways to low carbon heating&#xa0;\n2.1\n \nThe DECC Heat Strategy which was published in\n March 2012 and the subsequent \n2013 \ndocument \n‘The Future of Heating:\n Meeting the Challenge\n’\n \nhave \ngiven\n a \nvaluable insight into the\n Government’s ambitions. This has also provided a\n basis for a more informed debate about the prospects for reducing the carbon\n intensity of heating. W\nhilst these documents provide \na vision\n of wh\nat might be achieved by 2050, they are very light on \nthe \nmeasures \nby which these ambitions can an\nd will be delivered. Cru\ncially when considered alongside the practical challenges to decarbonise the heating market that we outlined earlier in this response, \nthey do not provide the level of certainty that t\nhe heating industry needs to\n bring the products\n to market\n with appropriate cost and performance characteristics and at sufficient scale to deliver the changes envisaged.\n2.2\n \nIndustry want to see m\nore robust shor\nt and medium term plans \nput in place \nto \nsupplement the long term vision\n2.3\n \nTo address th\nis issue HHIC has embarked on an ambitious project to try to plot out a pathway\n for\n decarbonising the domestic heating market. Phase 1 of this project, to establish some s\nhort to medium term scenarios has been completed. The findings are detailed in our report \n‘\nPathways for Domestic Heat\n’\n which can be accessed on the following link: \nwww.centralheating.co.uk/pathway\ns\n2.4\n \nThe objective of this work has been to address the \nchallenges presented by the government's heat strategy and in particular to provide alternatives to the largely all electric scenario\n.\n In particular HHIC's view is that in the medium term i.e.at least until 2030, the UK will need a greater mix of fuel and \ntechnology choices than those proposed by the heat strategy.\n2.5\n \nThe report is the result of an evidence based study into a range of differe\nnt pathway options using d\netailed \nmarket and economic analysis \ntogether with input on technology, performance and applic\nations from \nHHIC members from across the supply\n chain\n. \n \n2.6\n \nThe outcome of this study is a more realistic scenario for the deployment of domestic heating products in 2027 which:\n2.7\n \nOur sc\nenario does however \nenvisage\n a major c\nhange in product mix and that by 2027 condensing boilers will fall from the dominant position today with annual sales reducing to just over one third of the market. Of these nearly half would have solar thermal or flue gas heat recovery. Electric heat pump\ns would grow to just over one quarter of the market and about half of these would be hybrid heat \npump/hybrid products. Low carbon gas technologies (gas heat pumps, microCHP and fuel cells) would rise to one fifth of the market and district heating would su\npply about one tenth of the market\n2.8\n \n The report points out that this \nambitious\n view of how the market could be transformed can only be realised if the government also demonstrates its commitment. This would require the introduction of policies that stimulat\ne demand for low carbon heating and which provide industry with the confidence to develop and bring these\n products to market. P\nossible policy options \nare included in the report and \nthe next stage of the p\nroject \nwill start to develop these into more detaile\nd proposals.\n2.9\n \nThe outcome is a scenario which industry believes that with appropriate policy support it would be able\n to deliver. The acceptance by \ni\nndustr\ny and Government to delivering such a change and the establishment of a credible policy framework will\n then provide industry with the confidence needed to scale up the technical and market development of these products.\n&#xa0;\n3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe need for an ambitious policy framework&#xa0;3.1\n \nWhilst our pathways report provides \nsome \nconfidence\n that decarbonisation of th\ne\n market is a practical reality\n,\n Phase 2 will \nidentify\n policy options that could stimulate \nthe demand needed \nto \ndeliver the necessary scale of market transformation.\n We recognise the economic and political constraints but believe that we need \nan \nimaginative\n approach if we are to have any chance of success. \n3.2\n \nWe think that new market segmentation might allow us to better focus available resources and we are interested in the idea of establishing some low carbon heating communities. There are also opportunities\n for some limited regulatory levers that could be used.\n \nIndustry, with its \nclose\n knowledge \nand understanding \nof the market and customers is able to bring ideas to the table.\n \n \nIf we \nare to stand any chance of meeting the ambitions\n and potential that exists in this area, \nwe \nbelieve \na cross government action group \nshould be established to \nwork closely with industry and other stakeholders\n.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRole of the Domestic RHI&#xa0;4.1\n \nThe recent announcements about the RHI are welcome and will provide \na much needed \nstimulus \nto encourage the uptake \nof renewable\n heating. \nWhilst the tariffs within the scheme have been \ncautiously \nset \nto \nprovide \nsome \nrate of return on investment\n, there are still uncertainties about actual costs of installation\n of products at this early stage \nand the tariffs may not fully take account of barrier costs. The industry is very aware that the factors involved in replacing a heating system are different and more complex tha\nn a decision to install solar PV\n on a roof. A\ns a result we believe that the domestic RHI will still be a hard sell especially in the owner occupier sector.  \n4.2\n \nTaking into account the comments above and also the limited scale of the RHI \nthen \nthis scheme alone is\n unlikely to \ndrive the scale of uptake th\nat would be needed to deliver HHIC’s 2027 scenario\n. It is \nhowever\n a good start but will quickly need to be supplemented by other \npolicies which will help drive demand for low carbon and renewable heating\n.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHeat storage&#xa0;5.1\n \nThe \nheat generator is often the s\ningle\n \nf\nocus of any debate about heating; o\nther components of the heating system are also important and are likely to play an increasingly significant role in the drive to decarbonisation. \n5.2\n \nHeat storage will become an increasingly important factor in the de\ncarbonisation of UK homes. Combi boilers were introduced to the market in the 1990’s and since t\nhen \nhave grown in popularity mainly because, by\n eliminating the hot water tank\n,\n \nthey free up space in the home \nand\n are generall\ny easier and cheaper to install.\n \nHHIC boiler sales figures show that \nin the past year 76\n% of gas boiler sales are combi\n and the English House Condition Survey indicates that over 50% of homes now have a combi boiler. \n In the vast majority of cases the hot water tank will have been removed\n and the space used for other purposes.\n5.3\n \nThe characteristics \nof many\n alternati\nve low carbon sources of heat\n \nleads to a mismatch between heat demand and supply availability. \nRenewables are intermittent in availabili\nty and the inability to store electricity, \ntogether\n with limitations in the supply infrastructure means that it can be more \neconomical\n to provide heating at times where there is low demand. Another consideration is the cost and performance characteristics of \nalternative heating products. The higher\n costs mean that it can be more \nattractive\n to install a lower capacity product to provide continuo\nu\ns heating rather than one sized to deliver on demand fast heat up times. Some products such as heat pumps are also more energy efficient when delivering a st\neady heat load \nrather than peaks\n  \n5.4\n \nConsideration needs to be given to reversing th\nis\n trend \naway from hot water storage \nand \na \nsector based approach would be most appropriate \nf\nor this.   New homes provide a clear but limited opportunity to re-introduce hot \nwater storage. There would also be value in identifying and tar\ngeting those types of property \nwhere space is less of an issue, \nand \nto engineer\n innovative \nheat storage \noptions which can make use of unused spaces.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHeat distribution&#xa0;6.1\n \nThe design of heating c\nircuits can also have an impact on heating performance and efficiency \nin the UK, heat\n in the form \nof hot water generated in a boil\ner has traditionally been distributed around homes at relatively high temperatures of typically 80 deg\n.\n C.  The heating circuits and particularly the radiators have been sized for this high te\nmperature operation. By contrast the performance heat \npumps can fall off rapidly when they are required to generate such high temperatures\n, typically above 50 deg. C. \nThe design and sizing of the system therefore becomes much more critical when a heat pump is being installed. This characteristic does not necessarily mean that every new heat pump installation requires an expensive new heat distribution system. There \nmay \nhowever \nbe \nbenefits \nin identifying opportunities to encourage the installation of low temperature heating circuits in new homes or when major refurbishment work is being undertaken. Boilers can \nbe used equally well \nwith low temperature heating circuits and\n a small improvement (typically 1-2%) in efficiency would result. However the main benefit of such a move would be to future proof some homes for heat pumps as the conditions for the use of these products improves.\n \n&#xa0;\n*******************September 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
