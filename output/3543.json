"LGO10\nFurther submission from Gary Powell&#xa0;\nI refer to your e-mail of 6 November requesting a further submission from me in addition to the one I have already sent to the Committee in respect of the further inquiry into the work of the Local Government Ombudsman. \nIt is my intention to send to the Committee a further submission.\nIn the meantime, I attach three documents that I would like to be brought to the attention of the Committee. These documents are of such importance that each and every member of the Committee should have sight of them. I am considering e-mailing them and posting hard copies of the documents to each of the Committee members myself, for the avoidance of doubt. \nThe three documents I attach are:\n1. The LGO's published response to its 2012 staff survey, published on its website.\n2. \nThe actual \nL\nGO staff survey results: circulated internally to staff, not available to the public\n.\n \n3. My extract of the most significant points from the staff survey results.\nThe LGO staff survey result document was leaked by a member of LGO staff to my colleague Trevor R. Nunn, who took over the running of Local Government Ombudsman Watch when I retired as director. Given the dishonesty and subterfuge endemic in the LGO institution that has been allowed to continue unchallenged for so long, neither Trevor nor I were confident that the LGO would provide the Committee with the detailed report instead\n of the LGO's cherry-picked and sanitised version of its contents.\nAnyone reading the survey results from a perspective of objectivity will see that they amount to a damning indictment of the culture of the LGO, presenting a picture of widespread demoralisation among LGO staff, very serious criticisms of the ombudsmen themselves, and complaints about an \nintimidatory\n blame culture in the LGO institution. \nIn my attached extract, I have listed what seem to me to be the most serious evidence that the LGO is regarded by a large number of its own staff as being an institution riddled with bad practice and maladministration. \nI very much hope that members of the Committee will ask themselves whether the kind of institution described by the LGO's own staff in their survey could possibly be one that is consistent with the kind of institution described by Dr Richard Kirkham in the External Review he played such a significant part in producing. \nI include below a few quotations and statistics from my extract. Anything in quotation marks is quoted verbatim from the leaked report:\n&#xa0;\n“Concerns were expressed over the Ombudsmen’s lack of knowledge and credibility. There are widely held perceptions of unnecessary interference and micromanagement by one of the Ombudsmen, and the suggestion that involvement of that Ombudsman causes lengthy delays and often results in the failure to meet the required timescales and targets.”\n&#xa0;\n[***]\n “\nThere is also a perception of inconsistency in the approach of that Ombudsman.”\n&#xa0;\nStatement: “Our LGOs demonstrate good leadership skills.” A total of 80% of respondents disagreed, with 46% strongly disagreeing.\n&#xa0;\nStatement: “Our LGOs are visible and accessible.” A total of 67% of respondents disagreed, with 32% strongly disagreeing.\n&#xa0;\n“The LGO appeared unprofessional in front of the Select Committee. Respondents said that this was a very public embarrassment and was very damaging to the public face and image of the organisation. Comments made suggest that this demonstrated why they felt the LGO is not held in high regard by the government.”\n&#xa0;\n27% of LGO staff disagreed with statement “We provide a great service to our customers,” with 7% strongly disagreeing. (\nIn the LGO’s published summary and response, the LGO simply stated “39% believe we provide a great service to our customers but 34% are undecided,” as though no-one had said they positively disagreed with the statement. This is a highly misleading representation of the data to the public by the LGO, as although 34% of the respondents were indeed undecided about the statement, a further 27% positively disagreed with it, resulting in a total of 61% of respondents unable to affirm the statement because they were either unsure or actively disagreed with it. This is typical LGO selective reporting and spin-doctoring to the public.\n \nGJP\n) \n&#xa0;\n“The Local Government Ombudsmen were not seen as visible, available or approachable. Contact with the Ombudsmen was often for the wrong reasons, perceived to be down to a lack of trust. Staff believed that visibility needed to improve for the right reasons – to lead, support and set direction.”\n&#xa0;\n“Some respondents feel that going the extra mile counts for nothing and there is the suggestion that management will eventually use up the goodwill that comes with wanting to do a good job. Loyalty to the organisation is diminishing.”\n&#xa0;\nStatement: “General communication is clear and timely throughout the organisation.” A total of 68% of respondents disagreed, with 28% strongly disagreeing.\n&#xa0;\n“Respondents suggest that there needs to be a change in organisational culture, which is currently perceived to be one of blame and lack of trust.”\n&#xa0;\n“According to the responses, there is a need to increase the level of respect for staff and an acknowledgement that they are experienced and knowledgeable people. They want the leaders of the organisation to trust their skills, treat them as responsible people, set clear expectations and provide clear guidance and advice.”\n&#xa0;\n“There was very strong feeling that respect for staff was missing. Change feels imposed on staff, and the leadership team within LGO needs to display more support, empathy and understanding of how people are feeling about the changes.”\n&#xa0;\n“People recognised the need for culture change within the LGO and believed that a significant change in behaviour was required to build trust and confidence.”\n&#xa0;\n“Feedback is usually critical and often perceived to be unfair, with little regard for context of the problems / issues. More positive feedback would be welcomed.”\nIt seems to me that, as a result of its arrogance, incompetence and dishonesty, the Local Government Ombudsman is beginning to unravel, and that this is happening because of a new developing expectation of probity and accountability in our public culture: a tendency that is increasingly leading to public demands that those in authority who knew about bad practice and harm caused to our citizens, but did little or nothing about it when it was brought to their attention, be made to account for their actions: even when the events in question happened decades previously. The Internet has made the compelling evidence of systemic LGO bad practice and dishonesty freely available to complainants, and the fact the LGO seems to be finding it increasingly difficult to act with impunity, despite the assistance of its friends, has created internal tensions in the organisation that are highlighting its \ndysfunctionality\n and poor ethical ethos. \nI intend to be back in contact in due course with a further submission. I should be grateful to receive confirmation from you that you have received this e-mail with its three attachments, and that you will be distributing the documents in question to the members of the Committee.\n&#xa0;\n10 November 2013\n&#xa0;\n  \n              \nNot published with this submission but available on \nLGO website\n.\n  \n              \nPublished with this submission.\n  \n              \nNot published.\n  \n              \nText redacted\n"
