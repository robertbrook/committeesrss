[normal]I am a
[normal] retired agricultural scientist (b.1932) 
[normal]who worked on the mineral nutrition of crops specialising 
[normal]latterly o
[normal]n micronutrients when I consulted worldwide.
[normal]My reason for writing is because I feel that the issue of 
[normal]the use of 
[normal]GM 
[normal]technology still 
[normal]suffers from too much ignorance about 
[normal]its 
[normal]nature and how it compares with existing 
[normal]methods of plant breeding
[normal] let alone what problems it may help to solve.
[normal] The story of what GM technology amounts to needs to be more widely understood before it will be 
[normal]accepted especially in Europe. Acceptance is a prerequisite for the use of GM technology in north-west Europe and Africa.   
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Herbicide tolerance is an integral aspect[bold]GM technology relies on the transfer of identified genes into the existing DNA of cells. The identified gene may be taken from another organism or they can be constructed in the laboratory. The transfer is achieved either using a bacteria (
[normal]Agrobacterium
[normal]) to do the job or by shooting the gene attached to microscopic gold particles into a soup of cells.  This is a hit and miss affair
[normal]. The 
[normal]few cells
[normal] (as few as 1 in 1,000) that 
[normal]receive the gene
[normal] need to be separated from the rest order to avoid the impossibly massive amount of cell culture work to grow whole plants from each cell
[normal]. Luckily a gene that conferred 
[normal]toler
[normal]ance to the herbicide
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]glyphosate
[normal] (Monsanto) and 
[normal]glufosinate
[normal] (Bayer) were known
[normal]. So 
[normal]i
[normal]t became routine for th
[normal]ese
[normal] gene
[normal]s
[normal] to be inserted at the same time as the desired gene. The addition of 
[normal]a herbicide 
[normal]to the soup of 
[normal]treated 
[normal]cells killed off the cells that
[normal] had not got the desired gene (the antibiotic sulfonylurea was used by BASF in analogous way
[normal]). So began the dominance of Monsanto with their 
[normal]glyphosate
[normal] 
[normal]tolerant
[normal] soya, maize
[normal], oilseed rape, sugar beet
[normal] and cotton. Patents 
[normal]are now expiring on some of the varieties
[normal] 
[normal]so
[normal] farmers will be able to keep seed free of charge. 
[normal]Bayer developed varieties of oilseed rape, rice, soya and sugar beet tolerant to the herbicide 
[normal]glufosinate
[normal]. 
[normal]G
[normal]ene transfer is attractive to plant breeders as it allows identified beneficial genes to be added to existing good varieties relatively easily. This is to be contrasted
[normal] 
[normal]with the 
[normal]imprecise 
[normal]ways 
[normal]that 
[normal]new improved varieties have been bred in the past
[normal]. 
[normal] GM technology is a precise way of introducing a gene for a specific effect which causes minimal changes to the original DNA.
[normal] 
[normal]It is theoretically possible that the introduction 
[normal]of one or two genes 
[normal]might alter the performance of existing genes that might turn out to be deleterious.
[normal] This aspect is addressed in the safety evaluation of GM crops.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Crops 
[normal]have historically been 
[normal]improved initially by s
[normal]electin
[normal]g
[normal] seed from better grown plants in the field for use next year
[normal]. The next step was the artificial crossing by the transfer of 
[normal]pollen from and to plants with desirable characteristics followed by 
[normal]laborious long term 
[normal]studies 
[normal](10-15 years) 
[normal]to select beneficial progeny
[normal] from the random crosses. Even this innocent procedure of the mixing of two sets of DNA could have unexpected and undesirable consequences.
[normal]If a gene for a desirable trait e.g. resistance to a particular disease 
[normal]i
[normal]s not present originally then no amount of selection 
[normal]or crossing 
[normal]will find it.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The ability to cause mutations (mutagenesis) by 
[normal]subjecting
[normal] 
[normal]plant material
[normal],
[normal] especially seed
[normal]s to ionising 
[normal]radiati

[normal]n or
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]less
[normal] commonly
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]to
[normal] chemical
[normal]s 
[normal]has been used ex
[normal]t
[normal]ensively since WW
[normal]2
[normal] as a means of creating 
[normal]mutants with 
[normal]new genes. 
[normal]This 
[normal]chaotic random 
[normal]procedure hopefully results in plants with desirable characteristics that can then be crossed with existing valuable varieties. 
[normal]Over 3,200 varieties of more than 200 species have been developed by the unregulated
[normal] use of such mutants 
[normal]and are in use in about 100 countries
[normal]. Most of our crops have 
[normal]man-made 
[normal]mutants in their ancestry
[normal].
[normal]One such crop is
[normal] a mutant variety of barley produced by subjecting the seed to gamma rays now used to make the organic beer, Golden Promise. Does the organic movement in the UK notably the Soil Association and its patron Prince Charles consider 
[normal]radiation 
[normal]mutagenesis to be a natural procedure? 
[normal] A central plank of their 
[normal]objecti
[normal]o
[normal]n
[normal]s 
[normal]to GM 
[normal]is that we
[normal] 
[normal]should 
[normal]not 
[normal]mov
[normal]e
[normal] 
[normal]into the unnatural 
[normal]and the 
[normal]“realms that belong to God and to God alone”.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is notable that despite the use of radiation there has been no regulation or testing of the 
[normal]mutant-derived 
[normal]varieties for safety for man
[normal],
[normal] animals and the environment, a situation which is to be contrasted with the detailed
[normal] 
[normal]safety testing and evaluation of GM varieties
[normal].
[normal] .
[normal]It is likely that 
[normal]mutagenesis 
[normal]will cause 
[normal]more changes to the DNA than 
[normal]those 
[normal]evident 
[normal]as 
[normal]improvement
[normal]s
[normal]. 
[normal]S
[normal]uch changes could well 
[normal]lead to
[normal] proteins that are allergens or toxins
[normal] of which we are ignorant.
[normal] In contrast the possibility of allergen and toxin production by GM varieties is 
[normal]evaluated making them potentially safer than mutant-derived varieties.
[normal]Mutagenesis is seeing a resurgence in view of the absence of regulation. 
[normal]Second and Third generation GM crops[bold]Crops with insect resistant properties[bold]The first GM crops that were commercialised were crops such as soya and maize that were
[normal] tolerant of
[normal] a single herbicide
[normal],
[normal] the consequence of the GM methodology
[normal].
[normal]Insect resistance was transferred into 
[normal]maize, cotton and potatoes
[normal] from a 
[normal]bacterium
[normal] (
[normal]Bacillus 
[normal]thuringiensis
[normal])
[normal] which produces an insecticidal protein in the crops themselves (now called Bt crops). The o
[normal]rganic 
[normal]objectors to GM p
[normal]ermit
[normal] their farmers 
[normal]to use 
[normal]insecticidal 
[normal]spray
[normal]s and dusts
[normal] derived from 
[normal](
[normal]Bacillus 
[normal]thuringiensis
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]but not the Bt crops which is illogical. The gene for making t
[normal]h
[normal]is in
[normal]s
[normal]ecticidal
[normal] 
[normal]protein
[normal] 
[normal]could not be introduced by conventional breeding.
[normal] 
[normal]Work aimed at p
[normal]reventin
[normal]g
[normal] vitamin A deficiency by improving the 
[normal]dietary 
[normal]intake of the precursor β carotene 
[normal]exemplifies 
[normal]the different approaches that can be employed.
[normal] 
[normal] Rice, a staple for millions in South East Asia does not contain β carotene. If rice 
[normal]i
[normal]s to be used as a vehicle for β carotene then it 
[normal]is
[normal] necessary to introduce the gene for its production
[normal]; this was
[normal] done initially with a gene from the daffodil and then 
[normal]with 
[normal]a more efficient gene from maize to create Golden Rice
[normal] (by 
[normal]Syngenta
[normal]).
[normal] The improved rice varieties have been crossed with established local varieties.   
[normal]In contrast sweet potato (widely consumed in Africa but not South East Asia) does contain β carotene and so can be improved by conventional breeding
[normal] without gene transfer.
[normal]All concerned with he
[normal]lping
[normal] man to feed the anticipated global 10 billion have to consider 
[normal]all possibilities to 
[normal]improve crops. 
[normal]It is reassuring to know that 
[normal]research programmes
[normal] 
[normal]aimed at 
[normal]improving photosynthesis and 
[normal]at
[normal] conferring the ability 
[normal]for cereals 
[normal]to fix atmospheric nitrogen are under way in the UK. 
[normal]The potential benefits are so immense that success would probably lead to another “Green Revolution”. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is an inevitable consequence of all agricultural systems that nutrients are removed from the soil an effect that can be partly mitigated by recycling. In time the soil is unable to supply sufficient available minerals which need replenishing by application of appropriate fertilisers. Apart from nitrogenous fertilisers, which can be manufactured without the use of a finite raw material (at present they rely on oil), the current raw materials for fertilisers will eventually run out
[normal].
[normal] It will be necessary to use new, currently unusable, raw materials. The roots of some crops are known to exude chemicals that have the power to solubilise unavailable iron and manganese which plants can then absorb. 
[normal]It i
[normal]s not difficult to imagine extend
[normal]in
[normal]g
[normal] this work to 
[normal]all essential plant nutrients
[normal].    
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Every effort should be made in Westminster and in the EU to facilitate the cultivation of GM crops in the UK and in Europe.
[normal]Whilst it may take some time for public perception in the UK to warm to GM crops the very fact of a change will alter perceptions in many African countries where politicians are blocking GM developments because they are taking a lead from the EU. Improvements in the disease resistance of such crops as cassava and banana could make a big difference for many in Africa and be an ample reward for changes in Europe. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The arguments made by the opponents fall into two categories. Firstly arguments that are relevant to the technology itself and those that are related to the use of GM crops in the field which are basically irrelevant.
[normal]Not Natural[bold]Possibly the most commonly used argument is that the procedure is not natural and results in “
[normal]frankenfoods
[normal]”. If natural is meant to be what nature could manage without man’s help then GM technology is not natural. But so is mutagenesis which we do not object to. 
[normal]The claim that GM food is not safe for man, animals and the environment is repeatedly made and leads to demands for long term toxicology studies to demonstrate the absolute safety of GM derived food. There can never be absolute proof that there will never be any deleterious effects of GM crops. Such absolute proof cannot be demonstrated for any human activity.
[normal] 
[normal]The safety of all the GM crops currently grown across the world has been assessed by local regulatory bodies. The key aspect of all assessments is to determine whether the GM crop is fundamentally the same as its non-GM counterpart. 
[normal]WHO, 
[normal]the American Medical Association, the US National Academy of Sciences, the UK Royal Society and 
[normal]other respected scientific organisations have 
[normal]all 
[normal]concluded that 
[normal]GM crop
[normal]s pose no greater risk than crop plants modified conventional
[normal]ly.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Genes can of course escape by pollen transfer and may successfully enter the DNA of other plants - an aspect that is monitored. The beneficial attributes transferred to another plant might help its survival. For over 50 years it has been possible for the benefits conferred by mutagenesis assisted plant breeding to be transferred to other plants without any untoward happening. It may also be pointed out that for a few hundred years we have imported plants (over 2000 species) with their foreign genes into the UK again without deleterious effects of gene transfer.  
[normal]Organic groups look upon gene transfer from a GM crop to an organic crop as contamination in order to provide a rationale for their self-ordained regulations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Super weeds, Insecticide and fungicide resistant pests.[bold]              [bold]The
[normal] first attribute of GM crops was tolerance to the herbicide 
[normal]glyphosate
[normal] which meant that this herbicide could be sprayed to kill competing weeds without damaging the crop. Long before GM technology appeared it was known that repeated use of the same herbicide was likely to lead to the weed cultivars tolerant of the herbicide surviving and propagating next year. In the same way insects that are not killed by the insect resistant GM crop will survive and multiply. 
[normal]The involvement of GM technology is incidental. The problems of super weeds etc. will be solved,
[normal] 
[normal]whether the crop is GM or not, by the use of other herbicide and pesticides and by improvements to agricultural practices.
[normal]Because Monsanto were in the vanguard with their herbicide 
[normal]glyphosate
[normal] they attracted the attention of the GM opponents. They are no longer alone 
[normal]Syngenta
[normal] (who have donated their Golden Rice work to third world farmers) and others including Bayer, BASF, Dow, Du Pont Pioneer have joined them.
[normal]GM opponents ignore the basic fact that farmers are not coerced into buying anyone’s seed; they will only buy a particular variety if they perceive it to be a benefit to them. Hybrid seed has to be bought annually from the producer. The perceived unacceptable commercial practices of Monsanto are not valid reasons for rejecting GM technology. 
[normal]There is often more than one way of solving a problem but it is not logical to disregard an approach on this basis. The ways that prove easier to use, are more beneficial or are cheaper are likely to prevail. Marker assisted plant breeding is a very valuable tool and where applicable will be used. The proposed use of Golden Rice to combat the deadly vitamin A deficiency by improving the diet is simpler and cheaper than the alternative solution of providing 6 monthly vitamin A supplements to all children less than 5 years.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is easy to claim that as everything or not enough is not known about the outcome of a new process the precautionary principle should be adopted. Discussion of the principle is more likely to be at a theoretical level rather than evidence based at the scientific level. 
[normal]Is the precautionary principle adopted as a delaying tactic by people who ostensibly appear to be protecting the population from fears that they have created?

[normal]Why do people oppose GM[bold]?[bold]Amongst the first people to oppose GM technology in the UK were Prince Charles, the Soil Association and Greenpeace. The former’s opposition was based on the unnatural aspect and the “playing God” with nature. The opposition  of the Soil Association was said to be based on a study of the evidence which considering this was in the late 1990s before little was in the public domain about GM is difficult to accept: the ill-advised and flawed claims of 
[normal]Pusztai
[normal] had not been made to the media (1998).  The Soil Association backed and participated with Greenpeace, in the destruction of open field experiments with GM crops in 1998 and 1999 activities which attracted a lot of media attention. The rallying call from the Soil Association was that GM crops would contaminate organic crops with what result was not specified; Prince Charles (patron of the Soil Association) supported this hype. Before the Soil Association took an anti-GM position the sales of organic food in the UK (70% imported) were about £200 million; in 1998 and 1999 organic sales increased in both years by over 50%.  Did the massive media publicity given to the trashing of GM crop trials and 
[normal]frankenfoods
[normal] helped sales of organic food? The Soil Association, a commercial organisation, depends on negatives (e.g. no man-made fertilisers or pesticides are allowed) in its promotion. Was anti-GM just another convenient negative to promote sales?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The largely uncritical media fed the public a diet of “
[normal]frankenfoods
[normal]” and trial trashing that was countered by only minimal opposition from the scientific fraternity. This led to many people to conforming to what they thought was the common perception and accepting the premise that GM technology was to be avoided.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Positions that lacked a basis other than ideological
[normal] or commercial
[normal] were taken up in the early days of the GM story. 
[normal]For example 
[normal]Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and the Soil Association were 
[normal]unable, at 
[normal]an OECD 
[normal]Biosafety
[normal] Conference in Edinburgh in 2000
[normal], to provide evidence to support their claims that 
[normal]GM foods 
[normal]could damage 
[normal]human health
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]A parallel can sadly be drawn with the claims that organic food is healthier than traditionally grown food. The scientific community has known there is no basis for this claim. The truth was give media prominence in 2009 by the Food Standard Agency but  surveys still show that people buy organic food because they believe it is healthier and contains less pesticides (which is also not true).  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is likely that the public will respond similarly to GM technology and will never fully accept it despite the evidence in its favour. Politicians will have to take the lead and Owen Patterson is to be complimented in this regard.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]GM technology can help to achieve sustainable agriculture due to its ability to improve crop performance in precise ways for local crop/climate conditions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is said that current food production is sufficient if we were not wasteful. Likewise the proponents or organic agriculture maintain that the world can feed itself by farming organically. This they say requires the human race to renounce the consumption of animal products and so reduce the need for cereals. The ideas that the human race, especially as it becomes wealthier will become vegetarian and waste less is an unlikely proposition.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Atmospheric nitrogen is converted into organic nitrogenous compounds by bacteria living in symbiotic relationship with plants (e.g. the pea and bean family) and by free-living bacteria in the soil.  The current total global biological fixation of nitrogen is sufficient to provide enough protein for about 3 billion people. The rest mostly comes from man-made nitrogen fixation in factories. Without fundamental changes that one day may be achieved by transferring the nitrogen fixing ability to other plants by GM technology this truth will remain. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There will be a need to increase, possibly double, the production of man-made nitrogenous fertilisers in order to feed the anticipated stabilised global population of 10 billion.
