defaultI am a
default retired agricultural scientist (b.1932) 
defaultwho worked on the mineral nutrition of crops specialising 
defaultlatterly o
defaultn micronutrients when I consulted worldwide.
defaultMy reason for writing is because I feel that the issue of 
defaultthe use of 
defaultGM 
defaulttechnology still 
defaultsuffers from too much ignorance about 
defaultits 
defaultnature and how it compares with existing 
defaultmethods of plant breeding
default let alone what problems it may help to solve.
default The story of what GM technology amounts to needs to be more widely understood before it will be 
defaultaccepted especially in Europe. Acceptance is a prerequisite for the use of GM technology in north-west Europe and Africa.   
default&#xa0;defaultHerbicide tolerance is an integral aspectdefaultGM technology relies on the transfer of identified genes into the existing DNA of cells. The identified gene may be taken from another organism or they can be constructed in the laboratory. The transfer is achieved either using a bacteria (
defaultAgrobacterium
default) to do the job or by shooting the gene attached to microscopic gold particles into a soup of cells.  This is a hit and miss affair
default. The 
defaultfew cells
default (as few as 1 in 1,000) that 
defaultreceive the gene
default need to be separated from the rest order to avoid the impossibly massive amount of cell culture work to grow whole plants from each cell
default. Luckily a gene that conferred 
defaulttoler
defaultance to the herbicide
defaults
default 
defaultglyphosate
default (Monsanto) and 
defaultglufosinate
default (Bayer) were known
default. So 
defaulti
defaultt became routine for th
defaultese
default gene
defaults
default to be inserted at the same time as the desired gene. The addition of 
defaulta herbicide 
defaultto the soup of 
defaulttreated 
defaultcells killed off the cells that
default had not got the desired gene (the antibiotic sulfonylurea was used by BASF in analogous way
default). So began the dominance of Monsanto with their 
defaultglyphosate
default 
defaulttolerant
default soya, maize
default, oilseed rape, sugar beet
default and cotton. Patents 
defaultare now expiring on some of the varieties
default 
defaultso
default farmers will be able to keep seed free of charge. 
defaultBayer developed varieties of oilseed rape, rice, soya and sugar beet tolerant to the herbicide 
defaultglufosinate
default. 
defaultG
defaultene transfer is attractive to plant breeders as it allows identified beneficial genes to be added to existing good varieties relatively easily. This is to be contrasted
default 
defaultwith the 
defaultimprecise 
defaultways 
defaultthat 
defaultnew improved varieties have been bred in the past
default. 
default GM technology is a precise way of introducing a gene for a specific effect which causes minimal changes to the original DNA.
default 
defaultIt is theoretically possible that the introduction 
defaultof one or two genes 
defaultmight alter the performance of existing genes that might turn out to be deleterious.
default This aspect is addressed in the safety evaluation of GM crops.

defaultto select beneficial progeny
default from the random crosses. Even this innocent procedure of the mixing of two sets of DNA could have unexpected and undesirable consequences.
defaultIf a gene for a desirable trait e.g. resistance to a particular disease

default The improved rice varieties have been crossed with established local varieties.   
defaultIn contrast sweet potato (widely consumed in Africa but not South East Asia) does contain β carotene and so can be improved by conventional breeding
default without gene transfer.
defaultAll concerned with he

defaultThe potential benefits are so immense that success would probably lead to another “Green Revolution”. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is an inevitable consequence of all agricultural systems that nutrients are removed from the soil an effect that can be partly mitigated by recycling. In time the soil is unable to supply sufficient available minerals which need replenishing by application of appropriate fertilisers. Apart from nitrogenous fertilisers, which can be manufactured without the use of a finite raw material (at present they rely on oil), the current raw materials for fertilisers will eventually run out
default.
default It will be necessary to use new, currently unusable, raw materials. The roots of some crops are known to exude chemicals that have the power to solubilise unavailable iron and manganese which plants can then absorb. 
defaultIt i

default&#xa0;
defaultEvery effort should be made in Westminster and in the EU to facilitate the cultivation of GM crops in the UK and in Europe.
defaultWhilst it may take some time for public perception in the UK to warm to GM crops the very fact of a change will alter perceptions in many African countries where politicians are blocking GM developments because they are taking a lead from the EU. Improvements in the disease resistance of such crops as cassava and banana could make a big difference for many in Africa and be an ample reward for changes in Europe. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe arguments made by the opponents fall into two categories. Firstly arguments that are relevant to the technology itself and those that are related to the use of GM crops in the field which are basically irrelevant.
defaultNot NaturaldefaultPossibly the most commonly used argument is that the procedure is not natural and results in “
defaultfrankenfoods
default”. If natural is meant to be what nature could manage without man’s help then GM technology is not natural. But so is mutagenesis which we do not object to. 
defaultThe claim that GM food is not safe for man, animals and the environment is repeatedly made and leads to demands for long term toxicology studies to demonstrate the absolute safety of GM derived food. There can never be absolute proof that there will never be any deleterious effects of GM crops. Such absolute proof cannot be demonstrated for any human activity.
default 
defaultThe safety of all the GM crops currently grown across the world has been assessed by local regulatory bodies. The key aspect of all assessments is to determine whether the GM crop is fundamentally the same as its non-GM counterpart. 
defaultWHO, 
defaultthe American Medical Association, the US National Academy of Sciences, the UK Royal Society and 
defaultother respected scientific organisations have 
defaultall 
defaultconcluded that 
defaultGM crop
defaults pose no greater risk than crop plants modified conventional
defaultly.
default&#xa0;
defaultGenes can of course escape by pollen transfer and may successfully enter the DNA of other plants - an aspect that is monitored. The beneficial attributes transferred to another plant might help its survival. For over 50 years it has been possible for the benefits conferred by mutagenesis assisted plant breeding to be transferred to other plants without any untoward happening. It may also be pointed out that for a few hundred years we have imported plants (over 2000 species) with their foreign genes into the UK again without deleterious effects of gene transfer.  
defaultOrganic groups look upon gene transfer from a GM crop to an organic crop as contamination in order to provide a rationale for their self-ordained regulations.
default&#xa0;
defaultSuper weeds, Insecticide and fungicide resistant pests.default              defaultThe
default first attribute of GM crops was tolerance to the herbicide 
defaultglyphosate
default which meant that this herbicide could be sprayed to kill competing weeds without damaging the crop. Long before GM technology appeared it was known that repeated use of the same herbicide was likely to lead to the weed cultivars tolerant of the herbicide surviving and propagating next year. In the same way insects that are not killed by the insect resistant GM crop will survive and multiply. 
defaultThe involvement of GM technology is incidental. The problems of super weeds etc. will be solved,
default 
defaultwhether the crop is GM or not, by the use of other herbicide and pesticides and by improvements to agricultural practices.
defaultBecause Monsanto were in the vanguard with their herbicide 
defaultglyphosate
default they attracted the attention of the GM opponents. They are no longer alone 
defaultSyngenta
default (who have donated their Golden Rice work to third world farmers) and others including Bayer, BASF, Dow, Du Pont Pioneer have joined them.
defaultGM opponents ignore the basic fact that farmers are not coerced into buying anyone’s seed; they will only buy a particular variety if they perceive it to be a benefit to them. Hybrid seed has to be bought annually from the producer. The perceived unacceptable commercial practices of Monsanto are not valid reasons for rejecting GM technology. 
defaultThere is often more than one way of solving a problem but it is not logical to disregard an approach on this basis. The ways that prove easier to use, are more beneficial or are cheaper are likely to prevail. Marker assisted plant breeding is a very valuable tool and where applicable will be used. The proposed use of Golden Rice to combat the deadly vitamin A deficiency by improving the diet is simpler and cheaper than the alternative solution of providing 6 monthly vitamin A supplements to all children less than 5 years.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is easy to claim that as everything or not enough is not known about the outcome of a new process the precautionary principle should be adopted. Discussion of the principle is more likely to be at a theoretical level rather than evidence based at the scientific level. 
defaultIs the precautionary principle adopted as a delaying tactic by people who ostensibly appear to be protecting the population from fears that they have created?

defaultWhy do people oppose GMdefault?defaultAmongst the first people to oppose GM technology in the UK were Prince Charles, the Soil Association and Greenpeace. The former’s opposition was based on the unnatural aspect and the “playing God” with nature. The opposition  of the Soil Association was said to be based on a study of the evidence which considering this was in the late 1990s before little was in the public domain about GM is difficult to accept: the ill-advised and flawed claims of 
defaultPusztai
default had not been made to the media (1998).  The Soil Association backed and participated with Greenpeace, in the destruction of open field experiments with GM crops in 1998 and 1999 activities which attracted a lot of media attention. The rallying call from the Soil Association was that GM crops would contaminate organic crops with what result was not specified; Prince Charles (patron of the Soil Association) supported this hype. Before the Soil Association took an anti-GM position the sales of organic food in the UK (70% imported) were about £200 million; in 1998 and 1999 organic sales increased in both years by over 50%.  Did the massive media publicity given to the trashing of GM crop trials and 
defaultfrankenfoods
default helped sales of organic food? The Soil Association, a commercial organisation, depends on negatives (e.g. no man-made fertilisers or pesticides are allowed) in its promotion. Was anti-GM just another convenient negative to promote sales?
default&#xa0;
defaultThe largely uncritical media fed the public a diet of “
defaultfrankenfoods
default” and trial trashing that was countered by only minimal opposition from the scientific fraternity. This led to many people to conforming to what they thought was the common perception and accepting the premise that GM technology was to be avoided.
default&#xa0;
defaultPositions that lacked a basis other than ideological
default or commercial
default were taken up in the early days of the GM story. 
defaultFor example 
defaultGreenpeace, Friends of the Earth and the Soil Association were 
defaultunable, at 
defaultan OECD 
defaultBiosafety
default Conference in Edinburgh in 2000
default, to provide evidence to support their claims that 
defaultGM foods 
defaultcould damage 
defaulthuman health
default.
default&#xa0;defaultA parallel can sadly be drawn with the claims that organic food is healthier than traditionally grown food. The scientific community has known there is no basis for this claim. The truth was give media prominence in 2009 by the Food Standard Agency but  surveys still show that people buy organic food because they believe it is healthier and contains less pesticides (which is also not true).  
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is likely that the public will respond similarly to GM technology and will never fully accept it despite the evidence in its favour. Politicians will have to take the lead and Owen Patterson is to be complimented in this regard.
default&#xa0;
defaultGM technology can help to achieve sustainable agriculture due to its ability to improve crop performance in precise ways for local crop/climate conditions.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is said that current food production is sufficient if we were not wasteful. Likewise the proponents or organic agriculture maintain that the world can feed itself by farming organically. This they say requires the human race to renounce the consumption of animal products and so reduce the need for cereals. The ideas that the human race, especially as it becomes wealthier will become vegetarian and waste less is an unlikely proposition.  
default&#xa0;
defaultAtmospheric nitrogen is converted into organic nitrogenous compounds by bacteria living in symbiotic relationship with plants (e.g. the pea and bean family) and by free-living bacteria in the soil.  The current total global biological fixation of nitrogen is sufficient to provide enough protein for about 3 billion people. The rest mostly comes from man-made nitrogen fixation in factories. Without fundamental changes that one day may be achieved by transferring the nitrogen fixing ability to other plants by GM technology this truth will remain. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere will be a need to increase, possibly double, the production of man-made nitrogenous fertilisers in order to feed the anticipated stabilised global population of 10 billion.
