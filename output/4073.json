"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (BRC 60)&#xa0;\n1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe United Kingdom Accreditation Service \n(UKAS) \nis the national accreditation body \nfor the UK. UKAS is\n \nrecognised\n by government to assess, against internationally agreed standards, organisations that provide certification, testing, inspection and calibration services. UKAS is independent of \ng\novernment b\nut is appointed as the national accreditation body by the Accreditation Regulations 2009 (SI No 3155/2009)\n&#xa0;\nand\n&#xa0;\noperates under a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills, on behalf of government as a whole.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nU\nKAS \nassesses and accredits competent \nperson schemes under Part P of the Building Regulations on behalf of the Department of Communities and Local Government (DCLG). Accreditation by UKAS \nto the European standard BS EN 45011 \nis a condition of \nauthorisation \na\ns a competent person scheme by DCLG.\n&#xa0;\n3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBS EN 45011 is the European standard for organisations operating product certification systems. In this sense, UKAS accredits the competent person scheme\n operators\n to carry out the certification of \nthe installation se\nrvices provided by \nbusinesses\n,\n \nincluding their ability to \nself-certify \ntheir work as compliant with the Building Regulations\n. BS EN 45011 \nsets down requirements for certification bodies in \nterms\n of \ntheir\n independence, impartiality, technical competence and\n management \ncapability\n. Accreditation by UKAS provides an assurance that th\ne scheme operators\n meet the\nse\n requirements in relation to \nthe activities required of them to operate a competent person scheme. \n&#xa0;\n4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAn important part of the \ncertification process is t\no assess the technical competence of the contractors that are members of the competent person schemes against th\ne requirements set out in \nDCLG’s conditions of authorisation and the \nMinimum Technical Competence requirements\n set out for the installers themselves\n. \nAs part of the accreditation process, UKAS \ndetermines\n that this assessment is being carried out. UKAS carries out sample testing of the scheme operators and witnessed assessments to ensure this is the case. In this w\nay, accreditation ensures that consistent standards of competence are maintained.\n&#xa0;\n5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nD\nCLG’s conditions of authorisation require scheme operators to take a risk-based approach to the surveillance of their member companies. This is based on factors such as ins\npection outcomes, significant complaints and major changes in personnel. However, scheme operators must undertake a minimum of one on-site inspection of each member’s work every three years and new members need to be inspected annually for the first two ye\nars following initial assessment to establish a clean track record. Additional inspections can be carried out at the discretion of the scheme operators. The accreditation process ensures that the correct level of surveillance is carried out by the scheme o\nperators.\n&#xa0;6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUKAS considers that \ncompetition between the different operators of competent person schemes is a positive factor in terms of providing an element of choice for electrical contractors and keeping the cost of \ncertification\n at a reasonable level. \nT\nhe \nUKAS accreditation process is aimed at ensuring the consistency of outcome\n, where there are a number of providers,\n and therefore maintaining common standards. \n&#xa0;\n7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhilst DCLG maintains an overview of the competent person schemes and has ultimate responsib\nility for the authorisation of these schemes, the day to day assessment and supervision of the schemes is carried out by UKAS on DCLG’s behalf. The UKAS accreditation process is, of necessity, based on sample testing of the organisations concerned but is n\nonetheless a \nrigorous\n process\n. UKAS considers that accreditation provides the necessary level of assurance of competence without being unduly intrusive or expensive. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
