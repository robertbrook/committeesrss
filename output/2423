Written Evidence submitted by the Parole Board for defaultEnglanddefault &amp; Walesdefault (LAI 0030)default&#xa0;defaultThe Parole Board reiterates its stance in its submissions of June 2013 (copied below for convenience).  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Board observes that the government now proposes to narrow further the scope of funded prison law work, so the Board responds in addition as follows.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe government would confine legal aid exclusively to those cases where there is a question directly about the date of release i.e. parole reviews where the prisoner might be released, or sentence calculations which impact on release date. By contrast, there would not be any legal aid for pre-tariff reviews, or reviews for a re-transfer from closed to open conditions subsequent to an adverse development (the “excluded reviews”). Although these reviews do not involve a decision on release itself, most prisoners require a p
defaulteriod in open conditions before
default the Parole Board can be satisfied that they are safe to release.  There is in consequence, a great deal at stake for prisoners at these reviews.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Board is worried by the consequences of this proposal:
default1.
default              
defaultThe Board is minded to make more decisions in such excluded reviews on the papers i.e. without an oral hearing: in particular, where the decision comprises a positive recommendation to transfer to open conditions, or to re-transfer to open conditions. At the moment, a member may make these decisions on paper without an oral hearing but would do so only in restrictive circumstances. 
defaultThe government’s proposal is likely to result
default in applications
default for even more cases to be decided on the papers. But where prisoners have not been advised by a lawyer prior to the paper review, the Board may not be properly equipped with enough information to make a fair decision and may be exposed, if it does deal with the matter on the papers, to the risk of legal challenge.
default&#xa0;

default              
defaultThere are multiple queries about how to manage the Board’s review procedures where a prisoner is unrepresented; for instance:
default&#xa0;
defaultIn summary, we 
defaultbelieve 
defaultthat the proposal is very likely to impede our attempts to deal with cases 
defaultfairly, 
defaultpromptly and effectively.

default  
defaultOverviewdefault&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThis response focuses on the section devoted to proposals concerning those who represent serving prisoners whose cases are considered by the Parole Board.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt takes as its starting point the thesis set out at Chapter 3.1 and confines itself to the probable impacts of the proposed changes on the Parole Board
default&#xa0;
defaultBackground
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Parole Board operates in a very different way to a criminal court. Its decisions are based upon an investigative process and not an adversarial one. The skills required on all sides, including the prisoners’ representative bear little relation to those employed by a criminal trial advocate. Over time a body of specialist prison lawyers has grown up which understands the nature of the process and
default 
defaultcontributes to the quality of the 
defaulteventual decisi
defaultons and the ability to of the Parole Board to make those decisions in a timely manner
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe nature of the relationship between that specialist cadre
default and the Board means has led to:
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are concerned that the proposed changes may have a significant detrimental effect on these attributes, thus making the parole process slower, less efficient and more
default expensive
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultParticular areas in which the current cadre adds significant value which may be put at risk by the proposed changes are:

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultQ1. Do you agree with the proposal that criminal legal aid for prison law matters should be restricted to the proposed criteria? Please give reasons. default&#xa0;
defaultThe Parole Board disagrees with this proposal.  The removal of treatment, categorisation and resettlement issues from the scope of legal aid will have a dramatic effect on the ability of the Parole Board to make effective and timely decisions.  There is also evidence that it will considerably increase the cost of the Criminal Justice System overall.  The change in scope will increase the cost of conducting parole reviews and will increase the number of offenders who remain in prisons or higher security prisons than they might otherwise have needed, longer than previously with consequent cost of imprisonment overall.   
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Parole Board recently conducted an analysis of the high rate of deferrals in parole reviews.  It assessed the level of wasted costs to the Parole Board of approximately £1.57m a year.  This does not include the cost to prisons, probation and others involved in the process.  Significant contributory factors included the late or non-completion of relevant offending behaviour work or releases on temporary licence and the lack of adequate risk management plans including provision of appropriate accommodation and support in the community.  The latter is of particular concern to the Parole Board as this disproportionately affects young people, care leavers, women, offenders with mental health or learning or physical disabilities.   
default&#xa0;
defaultThe removal of these aspects of prison law from the scope of legal aid is likely to increase the chances of these issues arising and remaining unresolved at the point at which parole reviews commence.  The Parole Board recognises the work which lawyers undertake to avoid such a situation arising thereby saving resources across the system.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Parole Board anticipates that the change in scope is likely to lead to an increase in the number of cases referred for a decision.  At present, a significant proportion of cases such as those where an indeterminate sentence prisoner is challenging the reasons for his/her return from open to closed prison, will now result in the case having to be referred whereas 
defaulthistorically a skilled prison law practitioner could address this without recourse to the Parole Board.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ5. Do you agree with the proposal that providers should only be paid for work carried out on an application for judicial review, including a request for reconsideration of the application at a hearing, the renewal hearing, or an onward permission appeal to the Court of Appeal, if permission is granted by the Court (but that reasonable disbursements should be payable in any event)? Please give reasons. default&#xa0;
defaultThe Parole Board is very concerned about any attempts to limit the access which offenders will have to judicial review.  The parole process is unusual in that it is a judicial process for which there is no formal appeals mechanism.  As such, judicial review is the only avenue for offenders to formally challenge the decisions of the Parole Board.  Whilst our aim is to avoid legal challenges, the Parole Board is committed to a system which provides justice for all those affected by it and the opportunity to challenge parole decisions legally is an essential aspect of that.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ7. default&#xa0;defaultDo you agree with the proposed scope of criminal legal aid services to be competed? Please give reasons. default&#xa0;
defaultThe Parole Board considers that, whilst this is likely to increase the cover, it is likely to reduce the quality of the service provided.  The Parole Board anticipates that this is also unlikely to result in savings and indeed may result in an increase in costs to the system as firms seek to make the work viable by focusing on volume of work.  For example, by firms seeking to increase the proportion of adjudications where prisoners are represented from their present low level.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Parole Board performs a unique role which is quite distinct from that of any other court and as such is quite different in terms of the rules, procedures and practices which apply in other jurisdictions.  As such, the Parole Board values the very skilled and experienced practitioners who have specialised in prison law and particular the conduct of parole reviews.  The Parole Board recognises the very significant impact which these practitioners have in ensuring the system works as efficiently as possible.   The Board has worked hard to develop closer and more effective working relationships with specialist practitioners, particularly through the Association of Prison Lawyers and this has seen improvements in the system including the reduction in the backlog of cases and reduction in the deferral rate.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Parole Board is concerned about the impact of the cap on criminal work and lack of cap on prison law work will impact on the quality of the latter as firms seem to build volume of work to ensure a viable business model.  
default&#xa0;defaultQ8. default&#xa0;defaultDo you agree that, given the need to deliver further savings, a 17.5% reduction in the rates payable for those classes of work not determined by the price competition is reasonable? Please give reasons. default&#xa0;
defaultThe Parole Board regards this further reduction in rates presents a threat to the quality and level of provision of adequate legal representation in parole work.   This reduction comes shortly after a significant previous reduction.  The Parole Board is particularly concerned that in this context, pressure may be applied to remove the requirement for prison law practitioners to fulfil the requirements of the supervisor standard which provides the Parole 
defaultBoard, offenders and the tax payer with assurances about the quality of the legal representation being funded.  
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultQ34. Do you agree that we have correctly identified the range of impacts under the proposals set out in this consultation paper? Please give reasons.default&#xa0;defaultThe Parole Board
default accept
defaults
default that the paper (at Annex K) identifies the imbalances within the prison population and the likelihood of undue impacts on sections of that population.

default default&#xa0;defaultThe Parole Board is also concerned 
default– see paragraph 
default1 of our preliminary submissions - at the potential impact of the reduction in scope in prison law on vulnerable groups of prisoners. As we have said our concerns relate specifically to questions of re-categorisation and the creation of viable sentence and release plans and we wonder whether the comprehensive screening etc described at Annex K 5.1.3 will adequately fill the gap for prisoners with learning disabilities and young people generally.
