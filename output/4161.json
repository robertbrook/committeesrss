"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Tom Barker\n (CYS0085\n)\nMy background:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe legal regime dealing with cycles' use of th\ne roads is outdated. \nA different legal regime should apply to cycles\n than to motorised traffic.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAn approach to infrastructure which treats cycles and vehicles as interchangeable, or which models \ncycle\n behaviour on vehicle behaviour, will be a poor fit and \nproduce unintended consequences.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nData on cycle use and on accidents is poor and, even were it well collected, would give results varying by area. Local transport authorities must increase the detail of data which they are collecting. This task is urgent si\nnce it is a long process.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCycles should be protected approaching junctions. There exist more intrusive and less intrusive means to do this.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCultural change is the most important and the most urgently required, to be achieved through legislation if it canno\nt be effected sooner.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCultural change should first inform legislation and policy and afterwards a wider overhaul of infrastructure. Changes not rooted in an improved cultural understanding risk unintended consequences.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA system of 'presumed liability' woul\nd be a legislative change of the necessary scale which would remain easy for road users to understand. Such a change would support the type of cultural change which is necessary.\n&#xa0;\nA different legal regime should apply to cycles\n than to motorised traffic\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nA different infrastructural approach is needed for cycles.\n&#xa0;\nThe biggest changes required are cultural\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nStrict liability and presumed liability.\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
