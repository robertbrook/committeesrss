"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by YMCA&#xa0;&#xa0;1. Local Housing Allowance1.1 \nThe awareness \nlevels \nof the reforms taking place to the Local H\nousing\n Allowance amongst the\n yo\nung people survey\ned\n \nwas\n limited. \nOnly 1\n4\n% were aware that the age for the Shared Accommodation Rate had been raised to 35 years old, \n19\n% that the Local Housing Allowance has been lowered and just under a third of respondents (3\n1\n%) knew of the introduction o\nf a\n Housing Benefit cap.\n&#xa0;\n1.2 \nHaving co\nnsidered the reforms, very few young people felt the changes would positively impact on them. Only 5% felt \nthat the raising of the Shared Accommodation Rate would have any positive implications, 9% for the Housing Benefit cap and 12% for the lowering of th\ne Local Housing Allowance rate. \nThe primary concern raised was\n the impact that these \nreforms \nwould have in further limiting\n the housing opt\nions available to them\n when leaving supported accommodation\n. \n \n&#xa0;\n1.3 \nEven before the\nse\n \nreforms \nwere implemented\n, \nyoung\n people’s housing options were already extremely limited. As well as home ownership proving too expensive for young people, social housing was already difficult for them to access, even for those coming out of supported accommodation that traditional could\n have relied upon this form of housing. \nGiven \nalso \nthat living with parent\n(\ns\n)\n is not an option for many of \nthe \nyoung people \nthat\n YMCA\ns\n work with, t\nhis has made the private rented sector the \nonly \n‘non-supported’ \nhousing option\n available to \nmany \nyoung\n \npeople\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n1.4 \nThis penalises young people in \na \nnumber of ways including;\n \nt\nhe higher cost of rent in the private rented sector, the competition and availability of lower rent and shared properties, and the \nreluctance of many private landlords to let to young people on housing benefit. \nFinally, YMCAs are seeing a \nresistance\n \nto moving on \nfrom \nsome \nyoung people when properties in this sector do become available, due to both the quality \nof the property \ncompared \nto the quality at the YMCAs \nand a reluctance to share\n with other individuals\n. \n \n&#xa0;\n1.5 \nThese factors \nplus to reforms \nhave meant that \nmoving people on from supported accommodation to appropriate housing within the community \nhas\n become increasingly\n challenging\n for YMCAs\n. \nThe \nslow-down in the move-on\n \nrates currently being experienced by YMCAs creates two negative consequences. The first is delaying young people’s transition to independence. Something which \nthe young people responding felt was further perpetuated\n \nby potentially being forced \nby the benefit system \nto live in shared accommodation \nup until the age of 35\n. The second consequence \nis that the young people who are not able to be moved on are creating a situation of \n‘bed-blocking’, which \nis \nincreasing\nly\n \npre\nventing\n young people in \ngreater \nneed from being a\nble to access the accommodation and services YMCAs provide\n. \n&#xa0;\n1.6 \nA\nnother concern \nraised by the young people surveyed\n, which further compounds this \n‘perfect storm’ \nsituation, is\n the problem\ns\n these reforms \nalso \ncreate when they do manage to move out of supported accommodation. With the Local Housing Allowance being lowered and the extending of the Shared Accommodation Rate, the respondents felt \nthat \nthis increases the likelihood that the\n \nh\nousing \nb\nenefit they\n receive w\nill\n not meet the cost of renting in the private sector\n, putting\n young people under greater financial pressure and subsequently \nincreas\ning\n \nthe risk of homelessness.\n \nYet a\ngain the concern raised by young people\n surveyed\n is supported by what YMCAs \nare\n observing\n. A\n \nnumber of YMCAs \nreported \nbeginning to see increased demand \nfor supported accommodation \nfrom young people \nhaving difficulties accessing and sustaining \nprivate rented housing\n in their local area.\n \n&#xa0;\n1.7 \nIn response to the impact that YMCAs ar\ne seeing from \nthe\n reforms, they are introducing a range of measures. \nGiven the\nir\n l\nimited knowledge of the reforms \nand \njust under half the respondents (49%) saying that they did not feel prepared for the changes\n, \na\n number of YMCAs \nare\n \nbeginning to deliver\n \nan increase in the\n \nprovision of \nrelevant \ntraining and explanatory information \nthey provide to\n young people.\n \nYMCA Cornwall has begun running a Pre Tenancy Award training scheme as part of their Life Skills Project\n and\n \na number of \nother YMCAs \ndeliver similar\n schemes such as YMCA South Devon which runs a ‘fit for life’ scheme for 14-16 year olds.\n&#xa0;\n1.8 Several\n \nYMCAs\n are \nalso \nworking in partnership at a local level with \nboth public \nand private sector landlords to identify and develop suitable move-on accommodation for young people. \nAn example is Crewe YMCA who have initiated a private sector floating support scheme across the borough and\n are seeking additional private landlords to en\nter the market and either reduce their rents to Shared Accommodation Rate levels or change their model to a shared one.\n \nA\n significant number of \nYMCAs \nfrom right across England, including Milton Keynes, Exeter, Grimsby\n,\n Cleethorpes and Humber Region, Birmin\ngham and South London \nare \nalso \nlooking \nat\n extend\ning\n the amount of move-on accommodation provide\nd.\n \n&#xa0;\n1.9 \nTo help overcome the \ninitial \nbarrier that the cost of both the deposit and rent presents \nwhen\n looking to leave supported accommodation, a number of \nYMCAs are also \nbeginning \nto \ndeliver a range of schemes\n.\n \nYMCA Central Herts are encouraging saving \ntowards a deposit \nby introducing an \nincentivised savings scheme for residents in partnership with their local Credit Union. Another example is the Accelerated\n Move-On Scheme introduced by Romford YMCA, where the non-housing businesses provide a charitable bursary and rent deposit to young people.\n \n&#xa0;\n1.10 To \naddress the\n \nissue of increasing \ndemand\n for places\n, many YMCAs are running proactive schemes such as \nEastbourne and Wealden YMCA which delivers homelessness prevention workshops in schools.\n&#xa0;\n2. Direct Payment of Housing Costs to Claimants2.1 \nNearly half (47\n%) of all young people responding had heard about the introduction of monthly benefit payments, whi\nle a third (3\n5\n%) were aware of plans to introduce the direct payment of housing costs to claimants. Again, YMCAs were identified as the main source of their knowledge on these reforms, suggesting shortcoming in how \nthey \nhave been communicated to young peop\nle by \nrelevant \nlocal and national government bodies.\n&#xa0;\n2.2 While awareness of these reforms is much higher than with the \nprevious \nchanges, the respondents remained concerned that the impact of introducing direct payments of housing costs would be negative. \n15% of those surveyed felt monthly payments would be beneficial\n to them\n, \nwhile \nonly \n11\n% felt that directly receiving their housing costs would be positive. The main reason given by those questioned focused on the difficulties \nthey\n find managing their finances, and the potential for these reforms to lead to increased levels of debt, rent arrears, evictions and eventually homelessness. \nT\nhe widespread reluctance and anxiety towards these reforms is demonstrated by 86% of those young p\neople surveyed saying that if given the choice they would choose to have their housing benefit paid directly to their landlord.\n&#xa0;\n2.3 The concerns raised by the young people surveyed were echoed by the YMCAs who are particularly concerned with the period wh\nen young people move-on into the community. These reforms, without a managed transition phase, \nwere felt to \nhave \nthe \npotential to place unnecessary extra pressure on this already vulnerable gro\nup during this\n critical period in their move to independence. \n&#xa0;\n2.4 \nFirst\nly by delaying move-on rates\n,\n \nas \nYMCAs \nwill be reluctant to move\n vulnerable young people \ninto independent living if this could lead to them quickly going into arrears\n. \n \nSecondly, due to the predicted increase in the levels of arrears, evictions \nand homelessness resulting from vulnerable young people being unable to manage their housing costs, YMCAs expect to see an increase in demand for supported accommodation\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.5 While issues around budgeting are the biggest concern of the young people survey\ned \nregarding\n the introduction of direct payment of housing costs, the \nmost \npressing issue for \nthe future of \nYMCAs \nremains\n the\nir\n classification as ‘exempt’ or ‘non-exempt’ accommodation.\n \nUnder the current arrangements, the majority of the accommodation provided by the YMCAs would be classified as ‘exempt’, however uncertainty remains around a number of YMCA managed schemes. \nAn example is \nSupported Lodgings schemes\n run by YMCAs across Engla\nnd\n; \nwhere\n YMCAs recruit community hosts who have spare rooms \nto \naccommodate a young person in need as a ‘lodger’. \nIn these cases YMCAs receive the young person’s housing costs, and then pay the community hosts for their room.\n&#xa0;\n2.6 \nFor YMCAs providing accom\nmodation and services that are not classified as being ‘exempt’, vulnerable residents will be paid \ntheir housing benefit directly\n.\n This would mean that the cost of additional support services offered in these types of accommodation would not be covered. Al\nso, claimants\n receiving their own housing benefit may also put their tenancies at \nYMCA\ns \nat \nrisk if they are not able to pay their rent in full\n. \n \nAt present, residents in most YMCAs are responsible for the payment of a \nsmall \npersonal service charge\n, which\n \nis manageabl\ne for the majority, but YMCAs still\n incur arrears on these payments of around 10%\n of the total amount due\n. If this was translated into an equivalent loss against the total rent, this would \nrepresent\n a significant sum. \n&#xa0;\n2.7 The current lack of \nclarity provided by the government at a national and local level on the issue of ‘exempt’ classification \nputs the viability of many YMCAs at risk and \nmakes any long-term planning difficult. YMCAs, along with YMCA England, have been working with\n and making \nrepresentations to\n local council\ns\n and the Department of Work and Pensions \nover the last year \nto seek further clarification on this matter.\n&#xa0;\n2.8 \nIn response to the impact that YMCAs are expecting to see from \nthese \nreforms, they are introducing a range of \nmeasures. The young people surveyed suggested\n that their greatest need in preparation for these reforms was more information as well as additional training to help them manage their finances.\n \nTo address this \nneed\n, YMCA England and YMCAs have produced a ran\nge of materials \nand training \naimed at informing young people of the \nreforms\n. An example \nis \n‘\nYour Guide to\n Universal Credit’ \nwhich was circulated widely across the\n YMCA\n movement.\n&#xa0;\n2.9 To support young people with their financial management, l\nast year YMCAs provided 10,693 young people \nwith basic life skills training\n. \nTaking\n \nNorth London YMCA \nas an example, they\n run a ‘My Bank’ money management scheme\n for their residents\n and \nSouth London YMCA have introduced \na new process which sets clear expec\ntations on rent payments\n which\n has assisted them in reducing their overall arrears from 14% to 2% per year.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3. Localised Council Tax Support3.1 A significant number of the young people questioned (\n4\n2\n%) were aware\n of the removal of Crisis Loans and Community Care Grants, however only just over a quarter (\n28\n%) were aware of the introduction of \nCouncil Tax Support. The main sources of information on these were the YMCA and in the case of \nthe removal of \nCrisis L\noans a\nnd Community Care Grants \ntheir local Job Centre.\n&#xa0;\n3.2 \nOnce again there were very few young people \nresponding \nthat \nfelt these reforms would have a positive impact on their lives. \n10\n%\n felt \nthe introduction of Council Tax Support would have a positive impact \non them, while only \n8\n% felt that the impact of the Localised Social Fund would be positive.\n The key concern raised by the young people \nwas the difficulties the removal of Crisis Loans and Community Care Grants had made in being\n able\n to access finance, in particular capital, when in situations of need. A number of the respondents also raised the problems they were having or would have in paying Council Tax on already limited budgets\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.3 \nThe views expressed by the young people surve\nyed were suppor\nted by findings from the YMCAs, \nwho are seeing \nyoung people \nthat\n \nare now eligible to pay some form of Council Tax\n finding it more difficult for \nto manage \nfinancially\n. \nA\ngain the move-on stage was identified as being critical, with both the la\nck of access to finance and \nthe \nburden of paying Council Tax \nputting \nadditional financial pressure on them at an already difficult time.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.4 As with the other reform\ns\n, \nthe\n \nLocalised Council Tax Support was \nagain \nidentified as contributing to a decline in\n move-on rates and an increase\n in demand for supporting accommodation amongst young people.\n \n&#xa0;\n4. Household Benefit Cap &amp; Social Sector Size Criteria4.1 \nT\nhe introduction of both the Household Benefit Cap and Social Sector Size Criteria have to date only had a limited impact on the YMCAs and the young people they work with. \nThis\n is \nreflected in the responses received by th\nose young people\n surveyed, with a si\ngnificant majority believing the\n Household Benefit Cap \n(78%) \nand Social Sector Size Criteria\n \n(65%) \nwould have no \nimmediate \nimpact on them.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.2 \nHowever, a number of YMCAs\n \nare seeing\n \nthe introduction of the Social Sector Size Criteria \nas \nfurther \nexacerbating\n the problem of moving young people on from supported accommodation. \nF\nirstly\n due to\n people ‘downsizing’ t\no avoid the financial penalties further limit\ning\n the number of appropriately sized social housing available to young people. Secondly, youn\ng people who are fortunate enough to be offered a place in social housing are less likely to take this up if it \nis not appropriately sized and would mean\n being instantly hit with a financial penalty.   \n \n&#xa0;5. Recommendations5.1 Based on the findings set out in this response, the YMCA wishes to make the following recommendations to the Work and Pensions Select Committee.\n&#xa0;\n5.2 Communicate with young people on the reforms5.2.1 As the response demonstrates, young people’s knowledge\n of the reforms taking place to housing support is extremely limited. For significant change\ns such as the reduction in the Local Housing A\nllowance and \nthe raising of the age for the Shared A\nccommodatio\nn R\nate, fewer than 20% of the young people questioned w\nere aware that these had been introduced. Even for the most recognised change (The Social Sector Size Criteria), less than half of the respondents were aware of its introduction. \n&#xa0;\n5.2.2 These figures are even more concerning when considering that the majo\nrity (90%) of the respondents live in supported accommodation\n and are benefit recipients. T\nhis indicates a failing by national and local government to effectively communicate these changes to young people, denying them the opportunity to prepare and respon\nd effectively to the reforms.\n&#xa0;\nRecommendation 1: The YMCA proposes that the Government work with service providers to ensure that information about the reforms to the support for housing costs is tailored to young people.&#xa0;\n5.3 End discrimination against young people in the support arrangements5.3.1 As highlighted in this response, young people are already finding it disproportionately more difficult to find housing and they are seeing the choices available to them becoming increasingly limited. The feeling\n amongst the young people surveyed is that the reforms to the support for housing costs is not going to improve this situation, with no more than 15% thinking that any of the changes will positively impact on their lives.\n&#xa0;\n5.3.2 The support available for h\nousing costs should not perpetuate this\n problem\n, especially based on a false assumption that all young people can remain living at home. The welfare system should be primarily based on ‘need’ rather than actively discriminate against people based on ‘age’.\n \n&#xa0;\nRecommendation 2: The YMCA strongly opposes any moves towards the removal of housing benefit entitlement for under 25s.&#xa0;\nRecommendation 3: The YMCA proposes that the shared accommodation rate be removed.&#xa0;\n5.4 Offer protection for vulnerable young people5.4.1 As the evidence in this response demonstrates, the overwhelming preference (86%) of young people living in YMCAs is to continue to have their housing benefits paid directly to their landlord. The Government needs to exercise caution in its desire to\n pay housing benefit direct to claimant and respond to the views being expressed by vulnerable young people.\n&#xa0;\nRecommendation 4: The YMCA proposes that people living in supported accommodation remain exempt from directly receiving their housing benefit payments.&#xa0;\n5.4.2 \nLinked to this, t\nhe potential loss of funding for additional support services along with the risks associated with paying vulnerable people their benefits directly mean\n the future viability of many \nYMCAs across England and the valuable sup\nport they provide to young people depends on the decision made on what constitutes ‘exempt\n’\n accommodation.\n&#xa0;\nRecommendation 5: The YMCA proposes that the Government work with service providers to broaden the definition of ‘exempt’ to ensure it reflects the different models of supported accommodation delivered across the sector. &#xa0;\n5.5 Encourage a successful transition of vulnerable young people into independence5.5.1 Moving\n from supported accommodation to living independently is already a challenging time for \nvulnerable \nyoung people, both financially and emotionally. Young people felt having to begin managing their own housing benefit immediately upon leaving supported accom\nmodation had the potential to put additional pressure on them, increasing the likelihood for their transition to independence failing.  \n&#xa0;\nRecommendation 6: The YMCA proposes the introduction of progressive pathway for people leaving supported accommodation, whereby they can choose to continue to have their housing benefit paid to their landlord for an agreed period of time while they receive a tailored package of relevant training and support.&#xa0;\n5.5.2 With the replacement of Crisis Loans and Community Care G\nrants with ‘cashless grants’, the Government has significantly reduced young people’s access to capital in situations of need. This lack of capital can be particularly critical when young people are looking to move out of supporting accommodation in paying\n for a deposit and other related costs. \n&#xa0;\nRecommendation 7: The YMCA proposes that the Government work with relevant organisations to develop and promote financial products targeted at young people, in particular to help them access capital when moving from supported accommodation.&#xa0;\n5.6 Tackle the housing shortage5.6.1 \nFinally t\nhe reforms to the support for housing costs should not been seen as a substitute to the urgent need in England to build more homes, an issue which underpins all the points raised by\n the young people surveyed. As part of its Housing Strategy, the Government needs to focus on the housing needs of young people, particularly those in most need.\n&#xa0;\nRecommendation 8: The YMCA proposes that the Government, private sector and social landlords work together to invest in house building and increase the availability of social rent models and affordable private sector rentals.&#xa0;\n27 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nYMCA England – Your Guide to Universal \nCredit (2013)\nhttp://www.ymca.org.uk/newsmedia/latest/879-young-peoples-guide-to-universal-credit\n"
