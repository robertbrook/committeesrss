[[[Written Evidence from ]]]

[[[Matthew Grove, Police and Crime Commissioner for Humberside]]]

[[[ [CST0009]]]]&#xa0;Many thanks for affording me the opportunity to submit written evidence in relation to your inquiry into crime statistics.&#xa0;This inquiry is timely as Police and Crime Commissioners are one-year into their roles in holding their Chief Constable to account for the delivery of policing on behalf of the public.  This inquiry must consider the impact of this significant development.  It should take into account the improvement in local accountability, and the transparency, contextualisation and timeliness of information to the public by Police and Crime Commissioners, especially when compared to the time-lag in publishing national statistics which generally have little in the way of local context.&#xa0;

[[[Question 1: Are crimes being recorded by the police when they should be? Are crimes being categorised correctly?]]]&#xa0;We have all seen the continued reductions in recorded crime over the last several years and the ‘gap’ between recorded crime statistics and the crime survey results.  This ‘gap’ is arguably one of the reasons behind some of the dissatisfaction we hear from the public about published crime statistics.&#xa0;Locally, this ‘gap’ has been relatively small and consistent over the years due to the ethical approach adopted locally, following the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) to the letter.&#xa0;What has not happened over this period is a proper and informed debate about the victims ‘needs’ and a more common-sense approach to recording for certain crime categories.  For example, there is a tendency to ‘crime’ criminal damage or the more minor ‘violent’ incidents when the victim may merely want some form of restorative solution and does not feel a crime has been committed.  Police officers are not always afforded this kind of discretion and the NCRS rules sometimes take an element of this away from them.&#xa0;Locally, we have tended to take a risk-averse approach to the recording of crime.  This has arguably been a contributory factor in our higher levels of crime when compared to our peers.  This makes comparison difficult, but also raises the question over whether it is possible or even necessary to have national comparative statistics, especially as the focus of Police and Crime Commissioners is predominantly on local provision.  It also raises the question over whether a national standard for crime recording should continue to be viewed as achievable or even necessary.&#xa0;The other thing we have to remember with recorded crime statistics is that whilst the ‘traditional’ crimes (burglary, vehicle crime, and so on) are falling, fraud is replacing such crimes as the offence of choice for an increasing number of offenders.  The clear message needs to be that whilst other reported crime decreases, fraud in the UK is growing.  We also know that a large volume of fraud remains unreported, due to a number of factors such as victimisation of vulnerable and hard to reach groups, and we do not know the full scale of the threat and its impact on our local communities.  By focusing on ‘traditional’ crime recording, we are also in fear of putting our resources not in the places where they are most needed and will reap the greatest benefit to victims and our communities.&#xa0;It terms of the categorisation of crimes, my biggest concern is in relation to elements of violent crime.  The category of violent crime without injury can at times be a ‘catch all’.  Although it is right that we somehow capture minor assaults, as they could be an indicator of escalating activity by a person, whether we should ‘mix’ these incidents in with all violent crime is questionable.&#xa0;There is a further anomaly around violent crime.  Locally we are viewed as having one of the highest levels of recorded violent crime and yet a very low homicide level.  This undermines the validity of the data to some extent and an overall high rate of violent crime doesn’t display the local context, where we don’t have a culture of more serious and gun crime that you see in other areas of the country.  People make the incorrect assumption that they live in a violent place according to the statistics, whereas the reality is somewhat different in most parts of Humberside.&#xa0;

[[[Question 2: What]]]

[[[ are the factors which can influence police mis-recording of crime?]]]&#xa0;Following on from Question 1, they key issue is the time-frame for criming.&#xa0;I believe we need to question whether the police are sometimes too quick to crime an incident before taking into account the victims wishes and feelings.  The NCRS rules have to some extent taken away the common-sense element of policing.  There is no doubt in my mind that recording rules are a necessity, but we need to look potentially at a ‘cooling off’ period for certain crime types and the ability for discretion by police officers to take what they consider to be an appropriate response (which might not include criming), whilst ultimately record what is right after taking such time and accounting for the victims needs.&#xa0;The removal of the target culture has undoubtedly helped in reducing the possibility of ‘gaming’ by officers categorising crimes incorrectly, e.g. criming a dwelling burglary as a theft from dwelling when they may have reached their ‘quota’ of dwelling burglaries for the month.  This type of activity must be discouraged and the removal of a target culture helps in this respect.&#xa0;In addition, the over reliance on quantitative data combined with simplistic and inappropriate centrally set targets in the past has, in my opinion, 

[[[corrupted policing and led to perverse outcomes, devoid of common sense that has undermined public confidence]]].&#xa0;

[[[Question 3: Are the right checks in place to ensure that the systems for recording crime function]]]

[[[s]]]

[[[ effectively and accurately?]]]&#xa0;The Police and Crime Commissioners are there to hold their Chief Constable to account on behalf of the public.&#xa0;The question we need to ask is whether public perception of crime recording reflects the reality.  It is important that systems are in place locally and that they are effective for local circumstances.&#xa0;In Humberside, as part of my Police and Crime Plan, I will be rolling out mobile technology to ensure officers are visible in our local neighbourhoods and in the places where they are most required.  We need to recognise the risks in rolling-out such technology, ensuring the correct impact on crime recording, consistency and the use of common-sense by officers to individual situations.&#xa0;I am aware of the work by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) around data integrity.  This relies on a limited sample and doesn’t fully take into account the work undertaken by local Crime Registrars in their audits, findings and learning points.  This local element to me is important to ensure that our systems locally are as effective and accurate as they can be.  We need to create an atmosphere where we do things right for the victim in the first instance and correct any issues quickly if things do not go as expected.&#xa0;I will give an example where it could be questioned whether crimes are being recorded accurately.  Locally we have a high incidence of criminal damage (a crime) and a low incidence of anti-social behaviour (an incident).  It could be argued that we have taken a risk-averse approach to recording, hence the high-level of criminal damage.  Less risk-averse approaches could produce a more ‘balanced’ level of crimes and incidents.  Our approach indicates that we could be over-recording criminal damage, although our data integrity audits show that NCRS compliance is excellent, i.e. we’re not over-recording.  But this raises two questions: (i) whether others are following a similar line and (ii) the comparability of figures between forces.&#xa0;

[[[Question 4: Has enough been ]]]

[[[done to ensure the integrity of crime data? What more should be done?]]]&#xa0;See answer 3 above.&#xa0;

[[[Question 5: To what extent can policy-makers have confidence in the statistics which result from the recording of crime by police forces?]]]&#xa0;It is important for Police and Crime Commissioners to have confidence in their statistics locally in order to hold to account the Chief Constable on behalf of the public.  This is important for me at a local level.&#xa0;I am uncertain as to the level of confidence within other police forces and the ability for national policy-makers to have confidence in this data.  However, the duties of the Police and Crime Commissioner are clear, and if they are undertaken adequately then confidence in the data should be high.&#xa0;

[[[Question 6: Shou]]]

[[[ld recorded crime statistics be classified as National Statistics?]]]&#xa0;It is important that the statistics are accurate at a local level as part of my statutory duties.  The focus on local solutions through local statistics must be the way forward in the first instance.&#xa0;I believe that the National Statistics can be unrepresentative of the local picture.  In addition, the Office of National Statistics (ONS) now tend to produce quarterly figures which are devoid of context and tend to merely restate those figures presented to them in the first instance.  This is due in part to the risk-averse nature of crime statistics publications.  However, the ONS has produced guidance on the publication of local data which is useful to follow.&#xa0;We also need to bear in mind that we should all move away from the current culture of the recorded crime data being seen as the ‘result’ which is then often used as the stick.  We need to move to a place where the figures are used as ‘guidance’, for what they tell us as part of an overall holistic assessment of performance.  This includes a mixture of local qualitative as well as quantitative data.&#xa0;Finally, we need to publish statistics with context and in a manner which incentivises people to reporting and/or forces to record.  The clearest examples are the increasing rates of sexual crime and domestic violence that are evident throughout many parts of the country at present.  Such rises are depicted by the media and others as failure, whereas what they actually demonstrate is success through partnership working and the increase in the confidence of victims to report the crime by the variety of means we make available to them.&#xa0;The more serious crimes tend to be grossly underreported and we must make all efforts to encourage reporting of such crimes.&#xa0;&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
