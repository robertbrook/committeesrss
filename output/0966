VEP 0001[bold]Written evidence submit[bold]ted by Dr Susan Easton (VEP 0001[bold])[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Please find below my responses to the Draft Bill. I am responding as an individual with a particular research interest in this topic and relevant publications in this area
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Response to the[bold] three options in the draft Bill[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Option A disqualifying prisoner
[normal]s 
[normal]sentenced to 4 years or more in prison from voting
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Of the three options in the Bill, t
[normal]his is the option most likely to satisfy the Strasbourg Court. 
[normal]Using 
[normal]4 years 
[normal]as
[normal] the threshold
[normal] would separate offenders 
[normal]in terms of
[normal] the
[normal] 
[normal]seriousness of the 
[normal]crimes which they have committed. It would
[normal] introduce an element of proportionality into the sanction and provide a rational distinction and one that will be clear to judges, prisoners and the general public.
[normal] 
[normal]The numbers enfranchised would be substantial compared to the other options and would make a genuine difference.
[normal] 
[normal]It is consistent with the practice in other European states which have already been seen as 
[normal]proportionate
[normal] by the Court
[normal], 
[normal](
[normal]for example
[normal] 3 years in
[normal] Italy – see 
[normal]Scoppol
[normal]a v Italy
[normal] 
[normal] App. No. 126/05 (22 May 2012)
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]It would allow shorter term prisoners to retain an interest in the democratic process and 
[normal]a stake in 
[normal]the life of their communities of origin.
[normal] 
[normal]Although I would favour extending enfranchisement 
[normal]to a much 
[normal]wider range of prisoners, I would consider option A the best of the three options in the Draft Bill.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Option B: disqualifying prisoner
[normal]s 
[normal]sentenced to 6 months 
[normal]or more in prison from voting
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Option B has less merit. Although it is clearly an improvement on the present position
[normal],
[normal] it would bring relatively few prison
[normal]er
[normal]s into the electoral process 
[normal]and is less likely to satisfy the
[normal] Strasbourg
[normal] Court
[normal] than the first option
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Other European states which have permitted voting have
[normal] substantially
[normal] exceeded this figure. It is also 
[normal]a 
[normal]fairly arbit
[normal]rary point 
[normal]and hard to justify 6 months rather than
[normal],
[normal] say
[normal],
[normal] one 
[normal]year
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Disqualifying all prison
[normal]ers serving custodial sentences
[normal] from voting – a restatement of the current ban
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This is the least desirable option. It would certainly not be compatible with Art
[normal]icle
[normal] 3 of Protocol 1 of the 
[normal]European
[normal] Convention
[normal] or comply with the Court’s ruling in 
[normal]Hirst
[normal] 
[normal]and is difficult to defend 
[normal]from a legal standpoint.
[normal] 
[normal]An
[normal] argument in favour here is
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal] political/popu
[normal]list one that public opinion is mostly 
[normal]hostile to change
[normal] and clearly within democratic context the public’s view is important
[normal]. But 
[normal]the Strasbourg 
[normal]C
[normal]ourt has made clear 
[normal]in 
[normal]Hirst v UK (No.2)
[normal] App No. 74025/01,
[normal] (
[normal]6 October 2005
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]that public opinion may be one factor to consider but should not be
[normal] the
[normal] over
[normal]ri
[normal]ding factor 
[normal]when f
[normal]undamental rights are infringed.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Additional questions[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1 [bold]What are t[bold]he h[bold]ist[bold]ori[bold]cal and philosophical justificati[bold]o[bold]n[bold]s for denying priso[bold]n[bold]ers the right to vote[bold]?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]It is an a
[normal]ppropriate and additional punishment
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Prisoners do
[normal] not deserve
[normal] the right to vote as they have breached the social contract.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It encourages 
[normal]civic responsibility
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It preserves the purity of the ballot box
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Each argument is 
[normal]problematic
[normal]: it is difficult to justify losing the vote as an additional punishment and even if this were accepted, it would not comply with the accepted 
[normal]justifications 
[normal]of punishment (see
[normal] Q.
[normal]3
[normal] below
[normal])
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The argument based on desert is problematic as
[normal] the individual has already been punished by the loss of liberty and no additional punishments should be imposed.
[normal] 
[normal]The punishment for breaching the social contract is imprisonment so this should be sufficient. Moreover
[normal],
[normal] fundamental human rights are universal and apply to all r
[normal]egardless of their moral status or deser
[normal]t.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is difficult to argue that civic responsibility is promoted through this denial as the prison
[normal]er
[normal] is excluded from the democratic process and treated as a second class citizen
[normal] and the gap between offenders and the law-abiding majority is reinforced
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Including prisoners would not undermine the integrity of the electoral process if appr
[normal]opriate procedures are in place 
[normal]- see 
[normal]Q.8 below.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. W[bold]h[bold]y is [bold]the right to vote considered to [bold]be a human right?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]It is one
[normal] 
[normal]of the most fundamental rights enshrined in all major 
[normal]international Human Rights
[normal] C
[normal]onventio
[normal]n
[normal]s,
[normal] for example,
[normal] Article 25
[normal] of the
[normal] 
[normal]International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 21 
[normal]of the 
[normal]UN Declaration of Human Rights and of course Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the European Convention on Human Rights.
[normal] 
[normal]It allows and empowers individuals to participate in the democratic process, to influe
[normal]nce governments and to protect 
[normal]other key rights.
[normal] 
[normal]Loss of the right to vote is the key 
[normal]symbol of civic or social death and it is hard to justify
[normal] the 
[normal]exclusion of specific groups in a modern democratic society.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. Is disqualifying prisoners from voting a suitable part of their punishment?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]No.
[normal] 
[normal]Disqualifying prisoners from voting should not be part of their punishment, unless the 
[normal]prisoner has committed electoral offences which violate the democratic process e.g. postal voting fraud or misfeasance in a public office. Here the punishment is linked to the crime and could have a rational basis
[normal] for 
[normal]a temporary ban
[normal]. T
[normal]he Strasbourg Court has accepted
[normal] this
[normal] as a legitimate g
[normal]round for a temporary ban in 
[normal]MDU v Italy
[normal] App. No. 58400/00 (23 January 2003).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]But 
[normal]otherwise i
[normal]t is 
[normal]difficult to justify an additional punishment as the prison sentence is 
[normal]the
[normal] punishment. 
[normal]Disenfranchisement
[normal] bears no relati
[normal]on to the ty
[normal]pe of crime or gravity of the crime.
[normal] It is 
[normal]disproportionate and it can be seen a
[normal]s a
[normal] degrading punishment reducing
[normal] the 
[normal]offender to a state of civil death. 
[normal]It is
[normal] also an
[normal] arbitrary punishment as it depends on the timing of the elections.
[normal] It 
[normal]is
[normal] 
[normal]unlikely to deter offenders or the general public from committing crimes.
[normal] 
[normal]It does not contribute to the rehabilitation of
[normal] p
[normal]risoners. On the contrary
[normal],
[normal] it reinforces their social exclusion. Conversely
[normal],
[normal] allowing prisoners t
[normal]o
[normal] vote might encourage prisoners to reflect on their civic obligations and ultimately have positive implications in reducing re
[normal]-
[normal]offending
[normal] and 
[normal]r
[normal]einforcing 
[normal]their sense of having a stake in their 
[normal]community on release.
[normal] Research by Uggen and Manza in the United States found differences between voters and non-voters in their rates of subsequent arrest, incarc
[normal]er
[normal]ation and self reported criminal behaviour.
[normal] 
[normal]It is also not 
[normal]necessary for public protection. There is no risk to the public in granting the vote
[normal] 
[normal]to 
[normal]prisoners
[normal] regardless of sentence length
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.[bold] What are th[bold]e financial implications of maintaining the current ban[bold] in terms of claims by prisoners for compensation?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]In 
[normal]Greens
[normal] and MT
[normal] 
[normal]v UK 
[normal]App.Nos. 60041/08 and 60054/08 (23 November 2010)
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]Strasbourg 
[normal]Court
[normal] made clear
[normal] that
[normal] 
[normal]a declaration of incompatibilit
[normal]y 
[normal]cons
[normal]tituted
[normal] just satisfaction, and 
[normal]given that 
[normal]the UK was in the
[normal] 
[normal]process
[normal] of conside
[normal]ring change, would not grant co
[normal]mpensation
[normal] at that time
[normal]. 
[normal]The court noted that there were ar
[normal]ound 2,500 applications pending
[normal]. It said that it would 
[normal]not award cost
[normal]s
[normal] or 
[normal]examine applications registered prior to 
[normal]Greens
[normal] raising similar complaints and that it would strike out these cases if compliance is achieved. However
[normal],
[normal] it noted it could restore these applications if the UK does not c
[normal]han
[normal]ge the law to comply with 
[normal]Hirst
[normal]. 
[normal]A similar approach was taken by the domestic courts in 
[normal]Tovey et al v Ministry of Justice
[normal] [2011] EWHC 271 (QB). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]So it is 
[normal]likely 
[normal]that if a blanket
[normal] ban is retained
[normal],
[normal] the 
[normal]courts will make orders for com
[normal]pensation
[normal]. There is 
[normal]a backlog of 2
[normal],
[normal]500 to 3000 cases
[normal] in Strasbourg. In 
[normal]Firth and 2,353 Others v UK
[normal] App Nos. 47784/09
[normal](
[normal]26 March 2013
[normal])
[normal] the 
[normal]hearing of these applications was adjourned by the Court until the end of September 2013.
[normal] 
[normal]E
[normal]stimates have been made of subs
[normal]tantial costs.
[normal] 
[normal]The number of prisoners disenfranchised at the last election 
[normal]was
[normal] cl
[normal]early well in excess of 
[normal]3000 and if further applications are m
[normal]ade the consequences called be 
[normal]substantial.
[normal] 
[normal]In addition
[normal],
[normal] the Strasbourg Court could 
[normal]initiate infringement proceedings against the UK which could
[normal] then result
[normal] in
[normal] further financial 
[normal]penalties
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Obviously this raises issues regarding whether or not the UK should remain a party to the Convention
[normal] as well as constitutional issues over Parliamentary sovereignty
[normal] which are being debated in the country
[normal] and not yet resolved. However, 
[normal]i
[normal]nsofar as the UK 
[normal]currently
[normal] 
[normal]is
[normal] a 
[normal]party to the Convention then it may incur financial sanctions. But more importantly 
[normal]failure to comply 
[normal]undermines its 
[normal]legitimacy, p
[normal]articular
[normal]ly
[normal] when the UK government is (rightly) criticising other 
[normal]states for abusing human rights and violating the rule of law.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is difficult to find an appropriate and coherent threshold to exclude some prisoners from re-enfranchisement but from a legal standpoint,
[normal] sentence length is 
[normal]a possible criterion. Sentence length does
[normal] provide a rudimentary measure 
[normal]with which to distinguish offenders and offending when considering entitlement to vote
[normal]. 
[normal]The courts 
[normal]will take account of the harm caused and
[normal] the culpability of the offender in determining the seriousness of the offending
[normal] and
[normal] any mitigating and aggravating factors
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Sentence length is used as
[normal] a
[normal] basis for prisoner enfranchisement in 
[normal]several states including Italy 
[normal](see 
[normal]Scoppola
[normal]).
[normal] 
[normal]The four-year proposal 
[normal]would
[normal] 
[normal]include
[normal] those 
[normal]given longer 
[normal]sentence
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]for those 
[normal]offences which most concern the public.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]a)[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]keeping the law as it is[bold]?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]This will no doubt lead to further legal challenges within the domestic 
[normal]courts and the European Court of Human Rights
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe is scrutinising carefully the response and is unlikely to entertain any further 
[normal]delays
[normal] beyond this autumn. 
[normal]In effect this will be seen as 
[normal]a refusal to comply with international human rights law and standards.
[normal] 
[normal]It is accepted practice that the UK will and does comply with its international
[normal] obligations. Keeping the law 
[normal]as it is with an i
[normal]ndiscriminate blanket ban would
[normal] 
[normal]breach the obligations and lead to infringement proceedings. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]b)[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]passing legislation giving some prisoners the[bold] [bold]right to vote, but in a way that maintains a form of blanket restriction[bold]?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The question 
[normal]here is 
[normal]the number of prisoners who would benefit. If 
[normal]6 months were used very few
[normal] prisoners 
[normal]would benefit and this may not pass
[normal] a C
[normal]onvention challenge.
[normal] 
[normal]A
[normal] r
[normal]estriction
[normal] based
[normal] on 4 years
[normal] is less likely to fa
[normal]i
[normal]l. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]c)[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]seeking to comply by enfranchising[bold] [bold]the minimum number of prisoners [bold]possible [bold]consistent with our international legal obligations?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]This would be sufficient to ‘head off’ legal challenges domestically and internationally.
[normal] 
[normal]The 4 year option is most likely to achieve this.
[normal] 
[normal]The discussion of the d
[normal]raft bill and the parlia
[normal]mentar
[normal]y process of scrutinising
[normal] and discussing proposed leg
[normal]islation will also be important in showing that the UK has considered the matter in some detail.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]No. There are existing procedures in place for remand prisoners and th
[normal]e
[normal]se seem to work satisfactor
[normal]il
[normal]y and given the 
[normal]frequency
[normal] of elect
[normal]ions would not incur onerous bur
[normal]dens.
[normal] The current procedures used are 
[normal]set out
[normal] in Prison 
[normal]Service Order 4650 
[normal]Prisoners’ Voting Rights.
[normal] The Electoral Commission reviewed
[normal] the
[normal] proposals 
[normal]in the earlier Consultation Paper
[normal] in 2009 
[normal]and was 
[normal]sati
[normal]sfied that th
[normal]e proposed procedures were manageable and
[normal] that 
[normal]the integrity of the electoral process
[normal] would be 
[normal]preserved
[normal].
[normal] I would recommend postal votes to increase the level of control.
[normal] 
[normal]Procedures need to be clear for all concerned.
[normal] P
[normal]ostal voting is 
[normal]more tightly controlled now and
[normal] if properl
[normal]y
[normal] monitored allows a reduced risk of fraud. It is relatively easy to administer and there is an established 
[normal]s
[normal]ystem in place
[normal] already for remand priso
[normal]n
[normal]ers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]No
[normal]. If
[normal] prisoners use their
[normal] normal place
[normal] residence
[normal] outside the prison
[normal] 
[normal]by making a decl
[normal]a
[normal]ration of local connection,
[normal] the
[normal]re is no danger of bloc voting 
[normal]and 
[normal]the impact of 
[normal]their vote
[normal]s
[normal] will be diffuse
[normal]d 
[normal]across the UK.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]concern that prisoner
[normal] enfranchisement
[normal] will undermine the purity of the ballot 
[normal]box has been raised
[normal]. The fear is that 
[normal]prisoners 
[normal]may elect
[normal] candidates who 
[normal]represent 
[normal]their
[normal] interests rather than the community as a whole, 
[normal]but
[normal] 
[normal]this would not be 
[normal]a
[normal]n issue in the model proposed for th
[normal]e UK of allowing voting in the
[normal] community of origin
[normal] where they would normally reside
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Allowing prisoners to regist
[normal]er using the prison 
[normal]address
[normal] would 
[normal]be 
[normal]un
[normal]desirable. 
[normal]The example often give
[normal]n is the Isle of 
[normal]Wight where there is
[normal] currently
[normal] a relatively large number of prisoners within
[normal] 
[normal]a small constituency and w
[normal]here 
[normal]the
[normal]re
[normal] may be a narrow margin between candidates. If 
[normal]prisoners 
[normal]are registered in the communities with which they have a local connection then it makes sense for them to express their view on who sho
[normal]u
[normal]ld represent them as they
[normal] may 
[normal]be living 
[normal]t
[normal]here when released.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The available evidence sugge
[normal]sts that 
[normal]it is not problematic. In other states it is accepted by the public and seem
[normal]s
[normal] to work
[normal] satisfactory. The over
[normal]all trend worldwide is towards re
[normal]-
[normal]enfranchisemen
[normal]t
[normal]. The issue has been considered by the Ca
[normal]n
[normal]adian Supreme Court, the High
[normal] C
[normal]ourt of Australia, the South African Constitutional Court and numerous other 
[normal]jurisdictions 
[normal]and these courts have failed to find a rational foundation for a blanket ban.
[normal] The Republic of Ireland
[normal] 
[normal]also changed the law in response to 
[normal]Hirst 
[normal]with no apparent ill effects and 
[normal]the change 
[normal]was in force 
[normal]for 2007 election
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]A clear cut 
[normal]pr
[normal]ocedure is essential.
[normal] 
[normal] In the U
[normal]nited States there have been problems of under-registration of eligible voters
[normal] because of the complexity surrounding entitlemen
[normal]t and registration procedures. 
[normal]It is 
[normal]also 
[normal]better to avoid a discretionary system or the involvement of the judiciary as it will add to the burden on the courts
[normal].
