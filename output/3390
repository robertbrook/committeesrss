defaultWritten Evidence from the Housing Ombudsman [PHS0034]default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultI 
defaultam grateful to you for giving me the opportunity to contribute to your committee's 
defaultinquiries into complaints handling.
defaultBefore addressing the specific questions posed in your letter, I think it would be 
defaulthelpful to the work of your committee if I sketched ou
defaultt some background information 
defaulton the Housing Ombudsman.
defaultBackground to the Housing Ombudsman Service defaultJurisdiction:defaultThe statutory Housing Ombudsman was created by the Housing Act 1996 and 
defaultcommenced operating as such on 1 April 1997. The relevant provisions of the1996 Act were amended in the Housing and Regeneration Act of 2008 and, more 
defaultsignificantly, in the Localism Act of 2011. The Housing Ombudsman is a corporation 
defaultsole and operates unde
defaultr a Scheme approved by the Secretary of State (of the 
defaultDCLG).
defaultI defaultam the second statutory Housing Ombudsman and was appointed in 2001. Until 1 
defaultApril 2013 my jurisdiction covered private not-for-profit (or 'not-for-dividend') 
defaultlandlords who are required by the 
default1996 Act to be members of my Scheme "for all his 
defaulthousing activities" and private for-profit landlords and managing agents who may 
defaultchose to be members. Since 1 April 2013 all the retained stock owned or managed 
defaultby Local Housing Authorities (LHAs) or by Arms
default Length Management Organisations 
default(ALMOs) on their behalf has come within my jurisdiction. Leaseholders of all 
defaultmember landlords are protected by my Scheme; there are, for example, about 
default300,000 leaseholders of LHAs and they, like leaseholders in the 'housin
defaultg 
defaultassociation' sector, do not fall into the definition of 'social housing' in the 2008 Act.
defaultSince 1 April 2013, therefore, it would be possible to categorise the Housing 
defaultOmbudsman Service as a 'hybrid', having jurisdiction in both the private and public
default 
defaultsectors. This is captured in our mission statement which is "impartial dispute 
defaultresolution in rented housing".
defaultThere are now 5.1 million units and about 12.5 million people in my jurisdiction. My Service is funded by the private, for-profit and not-for-profit, landlords who pay £1.47 
defaultper unit per annum and grant-in-aid from government of £847,000 for the LHA 
defaultdimens
defaultion of my jurisdiction.
defaultLocalism act 2011:defaultThe Secretary of State chose my Service to be the single housing ombudsman in the 
defaultLocalism Act so that there would be a "common route of redress for housing tenants" and "consistency in the treatment of complaints
default".
defaultIn 2011, the impact assessment which preceded the Bill stated that government policy was to:
default"...provide a common route of redress for all complaints about the performance of social housing landlords by designating a single, specialist 
defaultombudsman for soc
defaultial housing. In April 2010 a new cross-domain regulatory system was brought into effect, ensuring that tenants of local authorities and 
defaulthousing associations can expect a broadly similar level of service from their 
defaultlandlord. Given the move 
defaultto consistent standards across social housing, we 
defaultnow wish to put complaint handling on a more consistent footing 
defaultby
defaultdesignating
default a single ombudsman for all complaints about social housing 
defaultlandlords. At the same time, we want to ensure that there continues 
defaultto be 
defaulta
defaulthigh
default quality ombudsman service for all social housing tenants and their 
defaultrepresentatives"
defaultDesignating my Service as the single housing ombudsman was the preferred option because of our "existing single focus on housing". The option of giving the ext
defaultended 
defaultjurisdiction to the Local Government Ombudsmen was rejected as that would not 
defaulthave resulted in there being a single ombudsman "specialising" in complaints about 
defaultlandlords as their remit covers all Local Government services. This was consistent 
defaultwith g
defaultovernment's intention to have a single ombudsman in the context of a single, 
defaultcross-domain regulator where there were "common standards set by a single regulator" and where it would make little sense for complaints about landlord performance (including agai
defaultnst the standards) to be considered by two different ombudsmen.
defaultThese changes in the Localism Act stemmed from the government's recent review of social housing regulation which concluded, among other things, that the system for 
defaultmanaging social housing comp
defaultlaints should be changed in order to strengthen the 
defaultrole of locally elected representatives and tenant groups, and address a perceived democratic deficit in understanding of housing issues at the local level. The review 
defaultrecommended that a 'democratic filter' should be introduced so that in future tenants 
defaultwho had exhausted their landlord's complaints procedure would have to go through their local tenant panel, MP, or councillor, who, in turn, would seek to resolve the 
defaultcomp
defaultlaint before, if needed, referring the issue to the Ombudsman.
default&#xa0;
defaultIf there had not been changes to the Bill as it passed through the House of Lords 
defaultcomplaints would only have reached me if one of these 'designated persons' had referred it on to me. If they had not, the grievance would have died where it stood 
defaultand complainants would have been barred from bringing the issue to me. Their only, and remote
default, opportunity for redress would have been through the ballot box.
defaultChanges in the Lords resulted in residents being given a much wider range of 
defaultchoices in terms of seeking resolution of their grievances if not satisfied at the 
defaultconclusion of their landlords'
default internal complaints procedures (ICPs).
defaultDirect access to the Housing Ombudsman:defaultIn spite of clear provision to the contrary in the Localism Act, a myth has grown up 
defaultthat disputes cannot come to me until eight weeks have passed after completion of 
defaultproviders
default' internal complaints procedures (ICPs). This is a misunderstanding of the 
defaultAct and of my Scheme approved by the Secretary of State.
defaultIt is true that one choice would be to wait eight weeks and come straight to me but 
defaultresidents 
defaultmight decide instead to go to 
defaulta designated person (any MP, a local 
defaultcouncillor, or a designated tenant panel) and ask them to resolve the dispute. What is less commonly understood is that they may go to a designated person and ask 
defaultthem to refer their dispute to me immediately. The desig
defaultnated person may agree to 
defaultor reject the request but, provided that agreement or rejection is in writing or 
defaultconfirmed in writing, the matter could be with me the same day.
defaultThis means that all tenants of councils and of private, not-for-profit landlords may 
defaultuse the designated persons to achieve not only the 'dual track' access to me that was recommended by the Law Commission but also resolution of disputes by designated persons themselves. The choice lies with tenants depending on their 
defaultneeds and the outcomes
default they are seeking. Their landlords are best placed to help them make the right choice.
defaultTenants of those for-profit landlords who have chosen to join my Scheme can still 
defaultbring their disputes to me without having to decide whether or not to engage with 
defaultdesig
defaultnated persons.
defaultThe crucial upshot of these provisions is, of course, that all residents and tenants in 
defaultmy jurisdiction may have immediate and direct access to my Service if they so wish.
defaultLocal dispute resolution:defaultWe have made changes to ensure that more resources are devoted to early, local resolution where that is appropriate and proportionate. One example of this is that I 
defaultnow have the power, at any time, to promote local resolution of a dispute between 
defaultany landl
defaultord and any tenant in my jurisdiction by either referring the complaint back to the complainant and provider (and/or a designated person) or by providing them 
defaultwith assistance to resolve the dispute. Also, I may decide to suspend or not to 
defaultprogress an inves
defaulttigation if I think there is opportunity to resolve the dispute locally. 
defaultSo, for instance, if a complainant refers a matter to me before completing an ICP, my
default 
defaultnew power enables me to offer a solution to the parties there and then. Equa
defaultlly, I 
defaultmay propose a form of local resolution in any of the circumstances described above.
defaultStrategy reviews:defaultIn 2006 we carried out a fundamental review of our core process and people development practices. In consequence, performance against targets for the 
defaultorganisation improved yearly. The work that was then required to prepare for my 
defaultextended jurisdiction amou
defaultnted to the most far-reaching review of the Service since 
defaultit came into being on 1 April 1997.
defaultIn order to support Parliament's intention that, where possible, complaints should be 
defaultdealt with simply and quickly at local level and that an effective service i
defaults provided to 
defaultthose cases which are escalated to me we executed an ambitious change 
defaultprogramme which linked into our strategic imperatives. We carried out a fundamental 
defaultreview of all aspects of the organisation with one of our most important priorities 
defaultbein
defaultg to re-align resources to focus on front-end delivery.
defaultOur strategic aims for 2012-13 were delivered by means of a Transition Plan that 
defaultidentified and mapped specific, timed objectives and work-streams that:
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultClarified and defined the precise nature and 
defaultextent of my new role;
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDeveloped new policy regarding management processes and learning and 
defaultknowledge-management in the context of my new jurisdiction;
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultReviewed governance to ensure appropriateness for a statutory ombudsman 
defaultand his extended role and 
defaultjurisdiction;
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultReviewed and amended the approved Scheme;
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRe-engineered the core dispute resolution process;
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDesigned dispute resolution principles to be supported by learning delivery 
defaultmedia.
defaultIn order to ensure that the internal structure of the organisation
default would be fit for 
defaultpurpose we:
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDeployed the right people in the right roles;
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultReduced the size and cost of the leadership team so that more resources 
defaultwere applied to front-end service delivery;
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRe-configured our office space to ensure that it was suitable for the necessary 
defaultexpansion of the team;
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDeveloped internal systems to run the Designated Tenant Panels Register (in 
defaultaccordance with a specific provision in the Localism Act);
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDeveloped a new we
defaultbsite to meet the needs of all of our key stakeholders;
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultApplied our stakeholder management and communication strategy and plan 
defaultas critical factors in the delivery of the overall strategy and the mitigation of 
defaultrisks.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultHousing Ombudsman'sdefault new role:defaultMy new, two-pronged, role is now stated succinctly in the introduction to my new 
defaultScheme that was approved by the Secretary of State in February 2013; it is to 
defaultresolve disputes involving members of the Scheme, including making awards of 
defaultcompensat
defaultion or other remedies when appropriate, as well as to support effective 
defaultlandlord-tenant dispute resolution by others. This new, composite role is now 
defaultreflected in the changes to our strategic outcomes, revisions to the Scheme which 
defaultregulates the Service, t
defaulthe re-engineered core process, new Dispute Resolution 
defaultPrinciples, new learning media, and a re-focussed stakeholder management 
defaultstrategy.
defaultThe first 'prong' of my role is clearly reflected in our mission statement (above). We 
defaultaim to provide an escalated comp
defaultlaint-handling and dispute-resolution service which 
defaultis trusted, valued, and respected because it is fair, independent, impartial (free of 
defaultbias and prejudice), effective, efficient, transparent, appropriate, proportionate, and 
defaultrelevant. Equally, we aim to p
defaultrovide or assist dispute resolution, especially locally, 
defaultwherever possible and this theme is picked up in our vision which is to "work with 
defaultothers to increase trust in dispute resolution and to improve landlord and tenant 
defaultrelations".
defaultThe primary outcomes o
defaultf our vision and mission are that, in 2016:
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTenants and landlords have increased trust in dispute resolution;
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTenant and landlord relations are improved;
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLandlords have a positive view of complaints;
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDesignated persons are playing their part in resolving 
defaultdisputes fairly.
defaultPhilosophy:defaultThe changes to my jurisdiction and role as from April 2013 required a consequential 
defaultrevision to our philosophy which is now as follows:
default"In essence, we provide a high quality, impartial service to people who live in, 
defaultsupply, or manage housing. We offer our experience, skills, expertise, and guidance to help tenants, landlords, MPs, councillors, and tenant panels. We
defaultare not regulators. We are conciliators and problem-solvers. We provide objective solutions at the earli
defaultest appropriate point. We make a positive 
defaultcontribution to the quality of housing and dispute resolution within the Ombudsman's jurisdiction by:
defaulta) enabling and encouraging landlords to improve their standards of housing
defaultmanagement through our independent, 
defaultimpartial, and objective role by:
default- explaining the advantages of complying with our determinations, and 
default- encouraging a positive attitude to the value of the outcomes of complaints and similar feedback

defaultlations."
defaultOverall strategic intent:defaultBy achieving our mission, vision, their primary outcomes, and our philosophy we 
defaultshall realise our overall strategic intent which is to be relevant, make an impact, 
defaultmake a difference, and add value by:

defaultProviders comply with our recommendations and orders:
defaultThere have been very few instances since 1997 in which providers have faile
defaultd to 
defaultcomply with my recommendations or orders. They recognise, as the Law 
defaultCommission put it (in their Consultation Paper 196 ) the "political or moral pressure" 
defaulton them to put things right following a decision of the Ombudsman. They are also confident that
default the Ombudsman is independent and operates an impartial, quality-
defaultmanaged process that draws conclusions only from careful analysis of available evidence.

defaultresources on early dispute resolution, about 90% of cases were already being closed 
defaultwithout investigation.

defaultOn many occasions people contacting us had not completed their landlord's internal 
defaultcomplaints procedure (ICP). In most cases we used to advise completion of the ICP 
defaultbecause the. former Scheme provided that, usually, the Ombudsman would not 
defaultconsider complaints which in his opinion could still be pursued through providers' procedures.
defaultUnde
defaultr the new Scheme the value that we can add in these circumstances is even 
defaultgreater because I now have the power, at any time, to promote local resolution of a 
defaultdispute by either referring the complaint back to the complainant and provider and/or a designated
default person; or providing assistance to the complainant and provider and /or 
defaulta designated person to resolve the dispute.
defaultMany other cases are outside jurisdiction (OSJ) 
default(e.g. 
defaultthe provider may not be a 
defaultmember of the Scheme, or the issue may not relate to a land
defaultlord and tenant

defaultand we may not be able to assist further. Nevertheless, whenever 
defaultwe can, we give information or advice on process and, where possible, signpost people to other agencies that may be able to help them. The table below

defaultWe give an external perspective:
defaultOften, we 'shine a light' into areas that are obscured from the view of providers. 
defaultUsually, they accept our findings, acknowledge their failings, and put them right. Even when they may be displeased by the discovery that their systems or 
defaultmanagement procedures are not as good as they thought they were providers still 
defaulttend to accept our de
defaultcisions recognising that they are fair and un-biased and that the 
defaultOmbudsman has a unique perspective on the way their organisations operate in 
defaultpractice.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe make 
default'gratis' 
defaultrecommendations:
defaultEven where we do not make a finding of service failure or maladminist
defaultration we 
defaultsometimes make suggestions to providers for them to consider as part of their customer care and service provision. How they deal with those suggestions is a 
defaultmatter for them but we consider this to be another contribution to the value that we 
defaultcan 
defaultadd to providers and their residents to enrich service provision and customer 
defaultcare.
defaultvi)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe identify service failure:
defaultFrom April 2013 and the operation of the new Scheme, I have been able to make 
defaultfindings not only of maladministration but also service failure. A finding of 
defaultmaladministration or, indeed, severe maladministration will still be available to and 
defaultwill be made in appropriate circumstances but extending the spectrum of 
defaultmaladministration wi
defaultll 
defaultenable findings that would not have merited the strength of 
defaultcriticism evoked by the concept of 'maladministration'. Feedback we have received 
defaultfrom providers and other 
defaultstakeholders indicates that providers are more likely to 
defaultreact with good grace to, and
default residents will, accordingly, benefit from, such findings 
defaultwhich can be expressed in more conciliatory and positive terms.
defaultvii)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe encourage local solutions:
defaultI now have the power to authorise the drafting of many more orders and 
defaultrecommendations in terms that wil
defaultl set out the presenting issues and then require 
defaultproviders to design appropriate remedial actions. Again, feedback from providers 
defaultand other stakeholders during the consultation process that preceded formal 
defaultapproval of my new Scheme, indicated that provider
defaults would more likely to be 
defaultencouraged to take responsibility for resolving disputes and be more likely to 
defaultproduce an outcome that suits local conditions and meets the particular needs of residents especially if providers work with tenant scrutiny panels. We
default are gathering 
defaultdata against which we shall test these assumptions.
defaultviii)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUnder the terms of my Scheme, providers are expected to comply with my 
defaultdeterminations. If they do not, I have the power to:
defaulta)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRequire them to report to me on compliance with a determination in such a 
defaultway and at such a time as I may specify;
defaultb)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultReport them to any appropriate regulatory agency and/or, in accordance with 
defaultthe policy o
defaultf localism and co-regulation as expressed in the Localism Act, the 
defaultboards, committees, or tenant scrutiny panels of providers;
defaultc)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOrder them to publish that they have failed to comply, in such a way as I see fit;
defaultd)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPublish the facts and circumstances of non-compliance naming the providers 
defaultin my annual report or elsewhere.
defaultix)
default              
defaultWe share our learning:
defaultAn important objective of my Service has always been to share lessons learnt not 
defaultonly with landlords but also with other
defaults with an interest in the outcomes of our core 
defaultprocess. Traditionally, we have done this by publishing reports, speaking at 
defaultconferences and seminars, and providing training for Board members, front-line staff, and tenants. Landlords, in particular, have fe
defaultd back to us that these initiatives have 
defaulthelped them to change and to design policies and practices in respect of complaint-
defaulthandling in particular and wider customer service in general. Our historical shared-
defaultlearning 
defaultinter-actions with providers and residents were so well-valued and 
defaultrespected that we were frequently approached by landlords and landlord and tenant 
defaultbodies to deliver it for them by special request.
defaultTo deliver our current vision and mission we intend to wo
defaultrk with landlords and 
defaulttenants to resolve disputes that come to us impartially using processes that are fair, 
defaultevidence-based, and free of bias and prejudice. These principles of dispute 
defaultresolution will be,the basis of 
defaultour work with landlords, tenants, MPs, 
defaultcouncillors, and 
defaulttenant panels. We are developing an extended set of dispute resolution principles 
defaultwhich will be augmented by complementary learning media. Working with all 
defaultinterested parties, we aim to achieve accessible dispute resolution that will be of
default 
defaultbenefit to both landlords and tenants and encourage landlords to use these 
defaultoutcomes to improve the services they provide.
defaultGovernance:defaultThe Housing Act 1996 (Sch. 2., para.10) provides for the Ombudsman's Scheme to 
defaultbe administered by a body corporate or by 
defaulta corporation sole. Until 1 April 2013 
defaultthere was a body corporate, IHO Limited, a company limited by guarantee and not 
defaulttrading for profit which, in 2006, was designated as an eNDPB. The Board 
defaultcomprised equal numbers of tenants, landlords, and independents 
default(the 'constituency 
defaultmodel'). The Secretary of State made an order establishing The Housing 
defaultOmbudsman as a corporation sole. As Ombudsman, Chief Executive, and
default 
defaultAccounting Officer, I am supported
default by an Audit and Risk Committee. In accordance 
defaultwith an express provision in the Scheme I may set up a Panel of Advisors but such a 
defaultgroup is not part of the governance of the corporation sole and advises me 
defaultpersonally.
defaultThe principal reasons for changes in g

defaultI turn now to the specific points raised in your letter. 
defaultHarmonisation of Ombudsman Schemes defaultEase of acdefaultcess:defaultTwo of the primary outcomes of our mission and vision are that tenants and 
defaultlandlords have increased trust in dispute resolution and designated persons are 
defaultplaying their part in resolving disputes fairly. It is important to understand that, for 
defaultus, th
defaulte 'increased trust' refers broadly to dispute resolution in rented housing that 
defaultmay be taking place locally between landlords and tenants or by designated persons as well as when it is escalated to me.
defaultAchievem
defaultent of our strategic intent will deliver better access to dispute resolution for 
defaultresidents.
defaultMany providers, especially since the coming into force of the Localism Act, have 
defaultreduced 
defaulttheir ICPs to two stages and many do not explicitly refer to 'stages' in an
default attempt to resolve complaints and disputes without raising an expectation that all 
default`stages' must be completed before resolution may be had. Such providers share with 
defaultus the importance of early, local, appropriate, and proportionate dispute resolution.
defaultCondefaultfusion:defaultMy recent experience is that confusion about the ways in which people in my 
defaultjurisdiction can complain has been caused by two principal factors. The first is the 
defaultclumsy, complex, and clunky drafting of section 180 of the Localism Act. When I 
defaultasked a
default leading Housing Law QC for advice on certain aspects of this section one of 
defaulthis observations was that "it is clear that it is unclear". If this is the opinion of a QC 
defaultlandlords and tenants can be forgiven if they too are confused and probably explains why
default myths such as that of the "8-week rule" occur.
defaultLinked to this is the complete lack of communication by government of the 
defaultconsequences of legislation such as section 180 to people who will be affected by it.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are all committed to achieving cost effectiveness and good value for money in 
defaultthese times of economic challenge and austerity but there is a strong case for 
defaultcertain, especially low-cost, exceptions. My Service does not have the resources to 
defaultmount far-reaching communication exercises. Even if we did, we must seek an 
defaultexemption from DCLG to spend money from our budget on, for instance, leaflets for 
defaulttenants. Recently, for example, I put up a business case to spend £6,000 on such 
defaultleaflets but, in 
defaultline with Francis Maude's decrees concerning spending on marketing, 
defaultpromotion, and communication, was eventually granted an exemption to spend £4,000.
defaultGiven these systemic limitations on our ability to inform, our strategic approach is to 
defaultwork with others 
default(e.g. 
defaultlandlords, trade bodies, and others) to use their networks and 
defaultresources to reach our customers.
defaultFitting alongside others:defaultIn terms of consultation and collaborative working the Localism Act adds the Housing 
defaultOmbudsman to the list of bodies with whom 
defaultthe Local Government Ombudsmen (LGO) may consult during the course of their investigations. It also provides that if, 
defaultat any stage in the course of conducting an investigation, I form the opinion that the 
defaultcomplaint relates partly to a matter which could be
default the subject of an investigation by 
defaultthe LGO, I must consult with the appropriate 'Commissioner' about the complaint 
defaultand, if I consider it necessary, inform the complainant of the steps necessary to 
defaultinitiate a complaint with the LGO.
defaultProvision is also made 
defaultto enable me and the LGO to carry out joint investigations. In 
defaultparticular, if at any stage in the course of conducting an investigation I form the 
defaultopinion that the complaint relates partly to a matter within the jurisdiction of the LGO, 
defaultI defaultmay conduct an investigation jointly with the LGO provided I have first obtained the 
defaultconsent of the complainant or the complainant's representative. Moreover, if I form the opinion that a complaint which is being investigated by the LGO relates partly to 
defaulta
default matter within my jurisdiction, I may conduct an investigation jointly with the LGO 
defaultand we may make joint reports so long as we distinguish my determinations from 
defaultother findings or 
defaultrecommendations.
defaultI am currently talking to the LGO about a memorandum of un
defaultderstanding (MOU) that 
defaultwill help us provide a seamless, high quality service to our respective customers for 
defaultthose occasions, should they ever occur, when we might conduct joint investigations. 
defaultThere have not been any since 1 April 2013.
defaultWe do not have an 
defaultMOU with the PHSO. To my knowledge we have not had a 
defaultsingle case in which our jurisdictions have ever overlapped although sometimes 
defaultpeople have contacted the PHSO about a matter within my jurisdiction and have 
defaultbeen referred by them to me.
defaultSharing good pracdefaulttice with other Ombudsmen:defaultMy colleagues and I attend conferences and special interest groups arranged and 
defaultsupported by the Ombudsman Association. Although my predecessor decided to 
defaultstop attending meetings of the Public Sector Ombudsmen Group because he, l
defaultike
default 
defaultme, considered the Housing Ombudsman to be, predominantly, a private sector ombudsman, I decided to accept Sir Tony Redmond's invitation to attend meetings of the group because I took the view that any opportunity to mix with other 
defaultombudsmen to share good 
defaultpractice, challenges, mutual concerns and interests, new 
defaultdevelopments, and emerging trends was of benefit to my Service.
defaultMy colleagues and I also meet other ombudsman and their colleagues at different 
defaultlevels for different purposes. In recent months, for ex
defaultample, I have had meetings with The Property Ombudsman, the Ombudsman (Property), the Pensions Ombudsman and the CEO of The Dispute Service. Colleagues have visited, for 
defaultexample, the Legal Ombudsman to share concerns and ambitions concerning data 
defaultcollectio
defaultn and processing for accountability, improved organisational performance, 
defaultand better customer service.
defaultSingle access point:defaultI am instinctively but cautiously drawn to this concept by the obvious benefits 
defaultespecially to customers if it could be organised eff
defaultectively and efficiently. During the course of my nearly 13 years as an ombudsman I have been to many meetings in 
defaultdifferent 
defaultfora 
defaultto discuss the implementation of a 'single portal'. It remains, however, 
defaultsomething of the 'holy grail' of ombudsmanry.
defaultMy conce
defaultrns are:
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWill it deliver my strategic aims and their primary outcomes?
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHow is it going to be paid for?
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWill that be more expensive than my present arrangements that have been 
defaultput in place following the fundamental review of our core process and role?
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhat 
defaultcontrol will 
defaultI defaulthave over the quality of service provision?
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhat would be my rights to withdraw from such a service if it wasn't working 
defaultto my satisfaction and to deliver my strategic aims?
defaultSingle PSOE:defaultA single PSOE appears, superficially, to be a good thing but, from my point of view, it 
defaultis another myth that has emerged from the mists of prejudice and assumption. To my knowledge it has never be subjected to what the judges call "nice chemical 
defaultanalysis".
defaultBefore I could support this idea I should need to be convinced by:
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultClearly set out aims, objectives, and outcomes;
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA clearly set out, argued rationale as to why it would be an improvement on 
defaultwhere we are now;
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA cost-benefit analysis;
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAn options appraisal;
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAn audit of necessary changes to primary legislation;
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAn informed and authoritative assessment of the likelihood of legislative 
defaultchanges and a clear indication of timescales;
default• A comprehensive risk assessment.
defaultI have had brief conversations with Julie Mellor and Jane Martin about this issue. I have made it clear to both that compelling evidence from the combination of the 
defaultabove list would be a 
defaultsine qua non 
defaultof my decision to support or not support the idea 
defaultof a P
defaultSOE. At my last meeting with Julie I made it clear that in the absence of such 
defaultevidence I would not be able to form a considered view of the concept.
defaultEuropean Directive in Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)defaultWhat consideration have you given to the introduction of the Directive and are defaultyou taking any action in response?default"Appropriate/alternative"defaultAlthough I get the point that the proposal applies to ADR that seeks to resolve 
defaultdisputes between consumers and trade
defaultrs "out-of-court" it is a pity that the Directive 
defaultdefines ADR as 
defaultAlternative 
defaultDispute Resolution rather than 
defaultAppropriate 
defaultbecause 
defaultcourts are sometimes the only 'appropriate' forum for the resolution of a dispute 
default(e.g. 
defaultnovel points of law, interpretation of t
defaulthe law, where remedies such as damages, 
defaultinjunction and specific performance are sought).
defaultCommon principlesdefaultThe Directive states that effective ADR procedures should be guided by a number of 
defaultcommon principles, such as impartiality, transparency, effectivene
defaultss, and fairness. 
defaultNo ombudsman in the UK or Ireland will disagree with this statement except to say 
defaultthat the criteria set out by the Ombudsman Association (OA) for membership in the 
default`ombudsman' category might go further than these criteria. The Cabinet off
defaultice and the Ministry of Justice have formally accepted and endorsed OA's extended criteria 
defaultwhich are included in their joint guidance to government departments which are 
defaultthinking of reviewing or setting up ombudsman schemes.
defaultCross-border complaintsdefaultThe int
defaultention of the Commission is to propose measures on ADR that ensure that all 
defaultconsumer complaints can be submitted to an ADR entity and that disputes arising from cross-border transactions and the digital environment may be more easily 
defaultresolved. On the basis
default of past experience, I do not expect my Service to be involved 
defaultin any cross-border transaction in the terms of the proposal.
defaultDigital environmentdefaultThe digital environment is of relevance to my Service and we plan further to develop 
defaultour website but also to cr
defaulteate a digital media communication strategy that will help 
defaultus raise awareness of our services and also to enable easier and wider access to them. We acknowledge government's aspiration to achieve 'digital by default' and 
defaultare seeking to work with others to overcome significant challenges facing residents 
defaultin my jurisdiction to achieve it. Many, for instance, cannot afford telephone land lines 
defaultand therefore have no access to broadband and the internet. Many others are
default 
defaultdenied digital facilities by reason of their advanced age, ill-health and other frailty, or 
defaultspecial needs.
defaultThe Directive will require Member States to ensure that all disputes between a 
defaultconsumer and a trader arising from the sale of 
defaultgoods or the provision of services can 
defaultbe submitted to an ADR entity, including through online means. Subject to the 
defaultchallenges referred to above, our new website is designed to be inter-active and, I 
defaultbelieve, would already meet the Commission's requiremen
defaultt.
defaultEnhanced redressdefaultThe second objective of the Directive to enhance redress for consumers is directly 
defaultrelevant to one of the aspects of my role but I cannot presently see how the Directive 
defaultwill actually enhance redress for residents, landlords, and managing agents in my 
defaultjurisdiction.
defaultLack of awareness and uneven qualitydefaultThe Directive recounts that analysis of the current situation identified certain main 
defaultshortcomings which hinder the effectiveness of ADR such as the lack of consumer 
defaultand business awareness, and the uneven quality of ADR procedures.
defaultWithin the limits placed on us by government in terms of communicating to our customers, we shall continue to 
defaultdo all we can raise awareness of our Service. In 
defaultparticular we shall use our new website and will continue to work with landlords and 
defaulttheir professional and trade bodies and with tenant organisations to get across 
defaultmessages about who we are, what we do, and
default how we add value.
defaultI am not in a position to comment on whether there is uneven quality of ADR 
defaultprocedures in the context of rented housing. I can say, however, that the quality of 
defaultmy Service has been consistently recognised and reflected in objective and 
defaultu
defaultnsolicited evidence.
defaultResidual cross-sectoral entitydefaultApart from my comments about private-for-profit landlords and managing agents being required to join my Scheme, I presently have no views on a residual cross
default&#xad;
defaultsectoral 
defaultentity.
defaultComplaints filed by traders adefaultgainst consumersdefaultThe Commission's proposal covers disputes between consumers and traders (the 
defaultlatter being defined as "any natural persons or any legal person, irrespective of 
defaultwhether privately or publicly owned, who is acting, including through any person
default 
defaultacting in his name or on his behalf, for purposes relating to his trade, business, craft 
defaultor profession arising from the sale of goods or the provision of services") and 
defaultincludes complaints filed by consumers against traders as well as complaints filed by 
defaulttraders against consumers. In the context of the Housing Ombudsman and assuming 
defaultthat the definition of "trader" includes landlords, there would have to be a change in 
defaultprimary legislation to allow landlords to trigger disputes coming to me.
default&#xa0;defaultAccessible information about ADR providers defaultThe proposal states:
default"When disputes arise, consumers must be able to quickly identify which ADR 
defaultentities are competent to deal with their dispute. To this end, this proposal 
defaultensures that consumers will be able to find information on the competent ADR entity in the main commercial documents provided by the trader and, where a 
defaulttrader has a website, on that website. In addition, traders will have to inform 
defaultconsumers on whether or
default not they commit to use ADR in relation to 
defaultcomplaints lodged against them by a consumer. This obligation will act as an 
defaultincentive for traders to use ADR more frequently."
defaultTo the 
defaultextent that "traders" includes landlords in my jurisdiction, these criteria are met. Some landlords even make clear in their tenancy agreements residents' rights 
defaultto escalate disputes. If for-profit private-sector landlords and managing agents were 
defaultrequired
default to join my Scheme as a result of the Directive, I have the power in the 
defaultapproved Scheme to require the same criteria of them.
defaultCosts, length, and complexitydefaultI am confident that the fundamental changes we have made recently to our 
defaultprocedures and practices i
defaultncluding, especially, our re-engineered core dispute 
defaultresolution process and strategic re-alignment of resources linked to an activity-based 
defaultcosting model will meet the following requirement of the Commission's proposal:
default`ADR procedures should be effective 
defaultand address certain shortcomings 
defaultassociated with court procedures, such as costs, length and complexity."
defaultResolution within 90 daysdefaultSince we have re-aligned our resources to deliver early local dispute resolution we 
defaultare completing cases in minutes, days, o
defaultr weeks and would expect in the majority of 
defaultcases to satisfy the Commission's requirement that:
default" Based on the results of existing studies, the present proposal requires that 
defaultdisputes should be resolved within 90 days."
defaultThe addition of the word "generally" later in the text satisfies me that 90 days is a 
defaultdesirable rather than an absolute and permits flexibility and discretion to produce a 
defaultjust outcome in appropriate cases such as, for instance, novel or complex cases, 
defaultins
defaulttances involving systemic issues, or matters containing important learning 
defaultoutcomes for the sector or in the public interest.
default&#xa0;defaultFree of chargedefaultThe proposal states that:
default"In order to ensure that ADR procedures remain accessible to all 
defaultconsumers,
defaultthe present proposal provides that they should be free of charge or of 
defaultmoderate cost for consumers."
defaultThe services of my organisation are free to residents at the point of complaint. 
defaultCompetent authoritiesdefaultIt is proposed that, in each Member State
default, a competent authority will be in charge of monitoring the functioning of ADR entities established on its territory. The competent authorities will, 
defaultinter alia, 
defaultassess, on the basis of information notified to them by ADR 
defaultentities, whether a given ADR enti
defaultty respects the quality requirements laid down by the present proposal.
defaultIt is not clear to me how such an arrangement would align with my existing duty 
defaultunder statute to report annually to the Secretary of State who lays the report before 
defaultParliament. If it 
defaultmeans double reporting there will be an unnecessarily bureaucratic 
defaultprocess and a risk that resources that would be better directed to providing an improved service to consumers will be needlessly spent on duplication.
defaultIt seems to me that where reports are 
defaultlaid before Parliament they are documents of 
defaultpublic record and this requirement should be enough to meet the requirements of the 
defaultDirective. Equally, the public availability of such reports should be enough to enable:
default" the competent authorities to publish regular reports on the development and 
defaultfunctioning of ADR entities. Every three years, the Commission will report to 
defaultthe European Parliament and the Council on the application of the Directive".
defaultTo what extent do you defaultbelieve the Directive will allow better and meaningful defaultcomparisons in performance and sharing of practice across providers or agencies?defaultI do not believe that the Directive will allow better comparisons in performance. Ombudsmen in the UK, for instance, hav
defaulte tried in a variety of networking 
defaultfora 
defaultto 
defaultmake 
defaultsuch comparisons but their constitutional arrangements, core processes, and 
defaultrelated performance measures, or KPIs, or targets are so disparate that comparison 
defaultinevitably fails to get apples and pears to coinc
defaultide.
defaultSubject to my fears of duplication and unnecessary costs referred to above, I do 
defaultbelieve, however, that "competent authorities" and the collation of reporting 
defaultmechanisms by the Commission to the European Parliament will provide the 
defaultpotential for a fra
defaultmework to facilitate sharing of good practice.
default&#xa0;defaultTo what extent do you think the Directive presents an opportunity to remodel defaultthe existing system of ADR to resolve possible existing overlaps, shortfalls, defaultand conflicts?defaultThe Directive states that another of the main shortcomings which hinders the 
defaulteffectiveness of ADR is "gaps in the coverage". The most obvious gap in terms of 
defaultmy jurisdiction is the fact that the vast majority of consumers of services provided by 
defaultprivate, f
defaultor-profit landlords and managing agents are excluded from access to my 
defaultService, and, therefore, justice, in respect of unsatisfactory provision of those 
defaultservices for which they pay market rents. These consumers have for too long been 
defaultthe Cinderellas at the
default ADR ball. Government strongly supports the role of the private 
defaultsector in the provision of rented housing. Giving tenants in this sector the right to 
defaultescalate their disputes to the Housing Ombudsman would not only give them the 
defaultrights of access to ADR requ
defaultired by the Directive and thereby access to out-of-court 
defaultjustice but would also test standards in that sector and drive up the quality of 
defaultcustomer service by reference to an ever-increasing body of learning arising out of a 
defaultrich bank of ombudsman decision-
defaultoutcomes.
defaultHow can those involved in dispute resolution, but who aren't covered by the Directive, ensure that they are meeting the same expected standards of quality defaultas those who are covered by it?defaultAs stated above, Ombudsman members of OA will not have diff
defaulticulty meeting the 
defaultstandards. Indeed, many of us, no doubt, will be able to argue that we exceed them.
defaultI suspect that the simple answer to this question is that those who are not covered 
defaultby the Directive should ensure, by amendment and revision if necessar
defaulty, that their 
defaultconstitutional arrangements meet the standards. This will be a matter, as may be 
defaultappropriate, for their Boards, councils, regulators, departmental sponsors, industry 
defaultstakeholders, and, ultimately, government.
defaultHow can the government ensure agadefaultinst the proliferation of excessive defaultnumbers of different dispute resolution bodies and mechanisms (and should it defaultbe doing so)?defaultThis is definitely something in respect of which the government should be taking a 
defaultlead. The proliferation of different ombudsmen and other dispute resolution bodies 
defaultin the same or similar industries, sectors, or businesses is very confusing to consumers and does not 
defaultserve them well in terms of straightforward access to 
defaultjustice.
defaultGovernme
defaultnt should ensure that the OA guidance endorsed by the Cabinet Office 
defaultand the Ministry of Justice is followed by its departments. One valuable contribution 
defaultto this outcome would be that all legislation setting up or reviewing ombudsmen or 
defaultother ADR schemes 
defaultshould be subject to a pre-condition of approval by Cabinet 
defaultOffice advised by Treasury Solicitors.
default&#xa0;defaultSpecific actiondefaultI have decided not to take any immediate action in response to the Directive 
defaultprincipally because I cannot see any obvious impact on my Service particularly in the 
defaultcontext of efforts to "improve the functioning of the retail internal market".
defaultFor the moment, I have decided to keep in close contact with fellow ombudsmen, especially t
defaulthose in the private sector, and monitor how the introduction of the 
defaultDirective develops and take any action as may be necessary.
defaultGiven that my Service's mission is "impartial dispute resolution for the whole rented sector", I shall be alert to any opportuni
defaultty afforded by the Directive to argue that the 
defaultwhole of the rented housing sector (including the private, for-profit sector) should be included in my jurisdiction.
defaultI defaulthope that this contribution is helpful to you and your Committee. Please contact my office
default if you need any additional information. I should be very happy to meet you at 
defaultthe House of Commons or at my office if you would like to discuss these matters 
defaultfurther.
