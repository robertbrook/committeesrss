[normal]Written Evidence from the Housing Ombudsman [PHS0034][bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I 
[normal]am grateful to you for giving me the opportunity to contribute to your committee's 
[normal]inquiries into complaints handling.
[normal]Before addressing the specific questions posed in your letter, I think it would be 
[normal]helpful to the work of your committee if I sketched ou
[normal]t some background information 
[normal]on the Housing Ombudsman.
[normal]Background to the Housing Ombudsman Service [bold]Jurisdiction:[bold]The statutory Housing Ombudsman was created by the Housing Act 1996 and 
[normal]commenced operating as such on 1 April 1997. The relevant provisions of the1996 Act were amended in the Housing and Regeneration Act of 2008 and, more 
[normal]significantly, in the Localism Act of 2011. The Housing Ombudsman is a corporation 
[normal]sole and operates unde
[normal]r a Scheme approved by the Secretary of State (of the 
[normal]DCLG).
[normal]I [bold]am the second statutory Housing Ombudsman and was appointed in 2001. Until 1 
[normal]April 2013 my jurisdiction covered private not-for-profit (or 'not-for-dividend') 
[normal]landlords who are required by the 
[normal]1996 Act to be members of my Scheme "for all his 
[normal]housing activities" and private for-profit landlords and managing agents who may 
[normal]chose to be members. Since 1 April 2013 all the retained stock owned or managed 
[normal]by Local Housing Authorities (LHAs) or by Arms
[normal] Length Management Organisations 
[normal](ALMOs) on their behalf has come within my jurisdiction. Leaseholders of all 
[normal]member landlords are protected by my Scheme; there are, for example, about 
[normal]300,000 leaseholders of LHAs and they, like leaseholders in the 'housin
[normal]g 
[normal]association' sector, do not fall into the definition of 'social housing' in the 2008 Act.
[normal]Since 1 April 2013, therefore, it would be possible to categorise the Housing 
[normal]Ombudsman Service as a 'hybrid', having jurisdiction in both the private and public
[normal] 
[normal]sectors. This is captured in our mission statement which is "impartial dispute 
[normal]resolution in rented housing".
[normal]There are now 5.1 million units and about 12.5 million people in my jurisdiction. My Service is funded by the private, for-profit and not-for-profit, landlords who pay £1.47 
[normal]per unit per annum and grant-in-aid from government of £847,000 for the LHA 
[normal]dimens
[normal]ion of my jurisdiction.
[normal]Localism act 2011:[bold]The Secretary of State chose my Service to be the single housing ombudsman in the 
[normal]Localism Act so that there would be a "common route of redress for housing tenants" and "consistency in the treatment of complaints
[normal]".
[normal]In 2011, the impact assessment which preceded the Bill stated that government policy was to:
[normal]"...provide a common route of redress for all complaints about the performance of social housing landlords by designating a single, specialist 
[normal]ombudsman for soc
[normal]ial housing. In April 2010 a new cross-domain regulatory system was brought into effect, ensuring that tenants of local authorities and 
[normal]housing associations can expect a broadly similar level of service from their 
[normal]landlord. Given the move 
[normal]to consistent standards across social housing, we 
[normal]now wish to put complaint handling on a more consistent footing 
[normal]by
[normal]designating
[normal] a single ombudsman for all complaints about social housing 
[normal]landlords. At the same time, we want to ensure that there continues 
[normal]to be 
[normal]a
[normal]high
[normal] quality ombudsman service for all social housing tenants and their 
[normal]representatives"
[normal]Designating my Service as the single housing ombudsman was the preferred option because of our "existing single focus on housing". The option of giving the ext
[normal]ended 
[normal]jurisdiction to the Local Government Ombudsmen was rejected as that would not 
[normal]have resulted in there being a single ombudsman "specialising" in complaints about 
[normal]landlords as their remit covers all Local Government services. This was consistent 
[normal]with g
[normal]overnment's intention to have a single ombudsman in the context of a single, 
[normal]cross-domain regulator where there were "common standards set by a single regulator" and where it would make little sense for complaints about landlord performance (including agai
[normal]nst the standards) to be considered by two different ombudsmen.
[normal]These changes in the Localism Act stemmed from the government's recent review of social housing regulation which concluded, among other things, that the system for 
[normal]managing social housing comp
[normal]laints should be changed in order to strengthen the 
[normal]role of locally elected representatives and tenant groups, and address a perceived democratic deficit in understanding of housing issues at the local level. The review 
[normal]recommended that a 'democratic filter' should be introduced so that in future tenants 
[normal]who had exhausted their landlord's complaints procedure would have to go through their local tenant panel, MP, or councillor, who, in turn, would seek to resolve the 
[normal]comp
[normal]laint before, if needed, referring the issue to the Ombudsman.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If there had not been changes to the Bill as it passed through the House of Lords 
[normal]complaints would only have reached me if one of these 'designated persons' had referred it on to me. If they had not, the grievance would have died where it stood 
[normal]and complainants would have been barred from bringing the issue to me. Their only, and remote
[normal], opportunity for redress would have been through the ballot box.
[normal]Changes in the Lords resulted in residents being given a much wider range of 
[normal]choices in terms of seeking resolution of their grievances if not satisfied at the 
[normal]conclusion of their landlords'
[normal] internal complaints procedures (ICPs).
[normal]Direct access to the Housing Ombudsman:[bold]In spite of clear provision to the contrary in the Localism Act, a myth has grown up 
[normal]that disputes cannot come to me until eight weeks have passed after completion of 
[normal]providers
[normal]' internal complaints procedures (ICPs). This is a misunderstanding of the 
[normal]Act and of my Scheme approved by the Secretary of State.
[normal]It is true that one choice would be to wait eight weeks and come straight to me but 
[normal]residents 
[normal]might decide instead to go to 
[normal]a designated person (any MP, a local 
[normal]councillor, or a designated tenant panel) and ask them to resolve the dispute. What is less commonly understood is that they may go to a designated person and ask 
[normal]them to refer their dispute to me immediately. The desig
[normal]nated person may agree to 
[normal]or reject the request but, provided that agreement or rejection is in writing or 
[normal]confirmed in writing, the matter could be with me the same day.
[normal]This means that all tenants of councils and of private, not-for-profit landlords may 
[normal]use the designated persons to achieve not only the 'dual track' access to me that was recommended by the Law Commission but also resolution of disputes by designated persons themselves. The choice lies with tenants depending on their 
[normal]needs and the outcomes
[normal] they are seeking. Their landlords are best placed to help them make the right choice.
[normal]Tenants of those for-profit landlords who have chosen to join my Scheme can still 
[normal]bring their disputes to me without having to decide whether or not to engage with 
[normal]desig
[normal]nated persons.
[normal]The crucial upshot of these provisions is, of course, that all residents and tenants in 
[normal]my jurisdiction may have immediate and direct access to my Service if they so wish.
[normal]Local dispute resolution:[bold]We have made changes to ensure that more resources are devoted to early, local resolution where that is appropriate and proportionate. One example of this is that I 
[normal]now have the power, at any time, to promote local resolution of a dispute between 
[normal]any landl
[normal]ord and any tenant in my jurisdiction by either referring the complaint back to the complainant and provider (and/or a designated person) or by providing them 
[normal]with assistance to resolve the dispute. Also, I may decide to suspend or not to 
[normal]progress an inves
[normal]tigation if I think there is opportunity to resolve the dispute locally. 
[normal]So, for instance, if a complainant refers a matter to me before completing an ICP, my
[normal] 
[normal]new power enables me to offer a solution to the parties there and then. Equa
[normal]lly, I 
[normal]may propose a form of local resolution in any of the circumstances described above.
[normal]Strategy reviews:[bold]In 2006 we carried out a fundamental review of our core process and people development practices. In consequence, performance against targets for the 
[normal]organisation improved yearly. The work that was then required to prepare for my 
[normal]extended jurisdiction amou
[normal]nted to the most far-reaching review of the Service since 
[normal]it came into being on 1 April 1997.
[normal]In order to support Parliament's intention that, where possible, complaints should be 
[normal]dealt with simply and quickly at local level and that an effective service i
[normal]s provided to 
[normal]those cases which are escalated to me we executed an ambitious change 
[normal]programme which linked into our strategic imperatives. We carried out a fundamental 
[normal]review of all aspects of the organisation with one of our most important priorities 
[normal]bein
[normal]g to re-align resources to focus on front-end delivery.
[normal]Our strategic aims for 2012-13 were delivered by means of a Transition Plan that 
[normal]identified and mapped specific, timed objectives and work-streams that:
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Clarified and defined the precise nature and 
[normal]extent of my new role;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Developed new policy regarding management processes and learning and 
[normal]knowledge-management in the context of my new jurisdiction;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Reviewed governance to ensure appropriateness for a statutory ombudsman 
[normal]and his extended role and 
[normal]jurisdiction;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Reviewed and amended the approved Scheme;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Re-engineered the core dispute resolution process;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Designed dispute resolution principles to be supported by learning delivery 
[normal]media.
[normal]In order to ensure that the internal structure of the organisation
[normal] would be fit for 
[normal]purpose we:
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Deployed the right people in the right roles;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Reduced the size and cost of the leadership team so that more resources 
[normal]were applied to front-end service delivery;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Re-configured our office space to ensure that it was suitable for the necessary 
[normal]expansion of the team;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Developed internal systems to run the Designated Tenant Panels Register (in 
[normal]accordance with a specific provision in the Localism Act);
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Developed a new we
[normal]bsite to meet the needs of all of our key stakeholders;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Applied our stakeholder management and communication strategy and plan 
[normal]as critical factors in the delivery of the overall strategy and the mitigation of 
[normal]risks.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Housing Ombudsman's[bold] new role:[bold]My new, two-pronged, role is now stated succinctly in the introduction to my new 
[normal]Scheme that was approved by the Secretary of State in February 2013; it is to 
[normal]resolve disputes involving members of the Scheme, including making awards of 
[normal]compensat
[normal]ion or other remedies when appropriate, as well as to support effective 
[normal]landlord-tenant dispute resolution by others. This new, composite role is now 
[normal]reflected in the changes to our strategic outcomes, revisions to the Scheme which 
[normal]regulates the Service, t
[normal]he re-engineered core process, new Dispute Resolution 
[normal]Principles, new learning media, and a re-focussed stakeholder management 
[normal]strategy.
[normal]The first 'prong' of my role is clearly reflected in our mission statement (above). We 
[normal]aim to provide an escalated comp
[normal]laint-handling and dispute-resolution service which 
[normal]is trusted, valued, and respected because it is fair, independent, impartial (free of 
[normal]bias and prejudice), effective, efficient, transparent, appropriate, proportionate, and 
[normal]relevant. Equally, we aim to p
[normal]rovide or assist dispute resolution, especially locally, 
[normal]wherever possible and this theme is picked up in our vision which is to "work with 
[normal]others to increase trust in dispute resolution and to improve landlord and tenant 
[normal]relations".
[normal]The primary outcomes o
[normal]f our vision and mission are that, in 2016:
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Tenants and landlords have increased trust in dispute resolution;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Tenant and landlord relations are improved;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Landlords have a positive view of complaints;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Designated persons are playing their part in resolving 
[normal]disputes fairly.
[normal]Philosophy:[bold]The changes to my jurisdiction and role as from April 2013 required a consequential 
[normal]revision to our philosophy which is now as follows:
[normal]"In essence, we provide a high quality, impartial service to people who live in, 
[normal]supply, or manage housing. We offer our experience, skills, expertise, and guidance to help tenants, landlords, MPs, councillors, and tenant panels. We
[normal]are not regulators. We are conciliators and problem-solvers. We provide objective solutions at the earli
[normal]est appropriate point. We make a positive 
[normal]contribution to the quality of housing and dispute resolution within the Ombudsman's jurisdiction by:
[normal]a) enabling and encouraging landlords to improve their standards of housing
[normal]management through our independent, 
[normal]impartial, and objective role by:
[normal]- explaining the advantages of complying with our determinations, and 
[normal]- encouraging a positive attitude to the value of the outcomes of complaints and similar feedback
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]helping to improve tenants' individual and shared amenity, environment, 
[normal]and quality of life
[normal]c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]sharing our expertise, principles, and lessons learnt by highlighting 
[normal]instances of good practice revealed by our process, and
[normal]d)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]supporting good landlord and tenant re
[normal]lations."
[normal]Overall strategic intent:[bold]By achieving our mission, vision, their primary outcomes, and our philosophy we 
[normal]shall realise our overall strategic intent which is to be relevant, make an impact, 
[normal]make a difference, and add value by:
[normal]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Being a catalyst for change in the rented-housing sector having fundamentally 
[normal]re-engineered, once again, our dispute resolution process with particular 
[normal]emphasis on the customer's perspective;
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Being the champion of good practice and the source of excellence
[normal] in 
[normal]complaint handling and dispute resolution in rented housing through 
[normal]appropriate and proportionate methods of dissemination;
[normal]c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Demonstrating that we are making an impact by collecting more data that 
[normal]provide evidence of the success of the measures we shall
[normal] set for 
[normal]organisational performance, service delivery, and monitoring improvement in 
[normal]dispute resolution practice in the sector;
[normal]d)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Applying our resources proportionately to the ombudsman functions of 
[normal]investigation, systemic failures, and knowledge disseminati
[normal]on.
[normal]Developing, improving, and enhancing the following nine characteristics of the value 
[normal]added by our service delivery will make a significant contribution to the success of 
[normal]our strategy:
[normal]i)
[normal]              
[normal]We help improve customer service and positive relationships:
[normal]The outputs of our investigations where service failure or maladministration is found 
[normal]are in the form of recommendations or orders, or both. They may require providers 
[normal]to:
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Tell us how they propose to put right the failings we have identified;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Give, or rest
[normal]ore to, residents their entitlements under statute or contract;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Introduce, amend, or properly apply their policies;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Make an apology;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Pay compensation.
[normal]Whether or not we find maladministration our principal aims in composing decisions 
[normal]are to:
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Put residents into the position in which they should have been but for their 
[normal]provider's failure;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Enable providers to learn from our findings and apply that learning to the 
[normal]improvement of the quality of the service they provide;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Help 
[normal]improve or sustain a positive relationship between providers and residents;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Contribute to the improvement of customer service.
[normal]ii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Providers comply with our recommendations and orders:
[normal]There have been very few instances since 1997 in which providers have faile
[normal]d to 
[normal]comply with my recommendations or orders. They recognise, as the Law 
[normal]Commission put it (in their Consultation Paper 196 ) the "political or moral pressure" 
[normal]on them to put things right following a decision of the Ombudsman. They are also confident that
[normal] the Ombudsman is independent and operates an impartial, quality-
[normal]managed process that draws conclusions only from careful analysis of available evidence.
[normal]iii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We provide advice, assistance, and signposting:
[normal]Even before 1 April 2013 and the re-configuration of our core process to concentrate 
[normal]resources on early dispute resolution, about 90% of cases were already being closed 
[normal]without investigation.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]On many occasions people contacting us had not completed their landlord's internal 
[normal]complaints procedure (ICP). In most cases we used to advise completion of the ICP 
[normal]because the. former Scheme provided that, usually, the Ombudsman would not 
[normal]consider complaints which in his opinion could still be pursued through providers' procedures.
[normal]Unde
[normal]r the new Scheme the value that we can add in these circumstances is even 
[normal]greater because I now have the power, at any time, to promote local resolution of a 
[normal]dispute by either referring the complaint back to the complainant and provider and/or a designated
[normal] person; or providing assistance to the complainant and provider and /or 
[normal]a designated person to resolve the dispute.
[normal]Many other cases are outside jurisdiction (OSJ) 
[normal](e.g. 
[normal]the provider may not be a 
[normal]member of the Scheme, or the issue may not relate to a land
[normal]lord and tenant 
[normal]relationship 
[normal]etc) 
[normal]and we may not be able to assist further. Nevertheless, whenever 
[normal]we can, we give information or advice on process and, where possible, signpost people to other agencies that may be able to help them. The table below 
[normal]demons
[normal]trates this activity up to the commencement of my new jurisdiction and our 
[normal]new processes and procedures.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We give an external perspective:
[normal]Often, we 'shine a light' into areas that are obscured from the view of providers. 
[normal]Usually, they accept our findings, acknowledge their failings, and put them right. Even when they may be displeased by the discovery that their systems or 
[normal]management procedures are not as good as they thought they were providers still 
[normal]tend to accept our de
[normal]cisions recognising that they are fair and un-biased and that the 
[normal]Ombudsman has a unique perspective on the way their organisations operate in 
[normal]practice.
[normal]v)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We make 
[normal]'gratis' 
[normal]recommendations:
[normal]Even where we do not make a finding of service failure or maladminist
[normal]ration we 
[normal]sometimes make suggestions to providers for them to consider as part of their customer care and service provision. How they deal with those suggestions is a 
[normal]matter for them but we consider this to be another contribution to the value that we 
[normal]can 
[normal]add to providers and their residents to enrich service provision and customer 
[normal]care.
[normal]vi)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We identify service failure:
[normal]From April 2013 and the operation of the new Scheme, I have been able to make 
[normal]findings not only of maladministration but also service failure. A finding of 
[normal]maladministration or, indeed, severe maladministration will still be available to and 
[normal]will be made in appropriate circumstances but extending the spectrum of 
[normal]maladministration wi
[normal]ll 
[normal]enable findings that would not have merited the strength of 
[normal]criticism evoked by the concept of 'maladministration'. Feedback we have received 
[normal]from providers and other 
[normal]stakeholders indicates that providers are more likely to 
[normal]react with good grace to, and
[normal] residents will, accordingly, benefit from, such findings 
[normal]which can be expressed in more conciliatory and positive terms.
[normal]vii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We encourage local solutions:
[normal]I now have the power to authorise the drafting of many more orders and 
[normal]recommendations in terms that wil
[normal]l set out the presenting issues and then require 
[normal]providers to design appropriate remedial actions. Again, feedback from providers 
[normal]and other stakeholders during the consultation process that preceded formal 
[normal]approval of my new Scheme, indicated that provider
[normal]s would more likely to be 
[normal]encouraged to take responsibility for resolving disputes and be more likely to 
[normal]produce an outcome that suits local conditions and meets the particular needs of residents especially if providers work with tenant scrutiny panels. We
[normal] are gathering 
[normal]data against which we shall test these assumptions.
[normal]viii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Under the terms of my Scheme, providers are expected to comply with my 
[normal]determinations. If they do not, I have the power to:
[normal]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Require them to report to me on compliance with a determination in such a 
[normal]way and at such a time as I may specify;
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Report them to any appropriate regulatory agency and/or, in accordance with 
[normal]the policy o
[normal]f localism and co-regulation as expressed in the Localism Act, the 
[normal]boards, committees, or tenant scrutiny panels of providers;
[normal]c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Order them to publish that they have failed to comply, in such a way as I see fit;
[normal]d)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Publish the facts and circumstances of non-compliance naming the providers 
[normal]in my annual report or elsewhere.

[normal]              
[normal]We share our learning:
[normal]An important objective of my Service has always been to share lessons learnt not 
[normal]only with landlords but also with other
[normal]s with an interest in the outcomes of our core 
[normal]process. Traditionally, we have done this by publishing reports, speaking at 
[normal]conferences and seminars, and providing training for Board members, front-line staff, and tenants. Landlords, in particular, have fe
[normal]d back to us that these initiatives have 
[normal]helped them to change and to design policies and practices in respect of complaint-
[normal]handling in particular and wider customer service in general. Our historical shared-
[normal]learning 
[normal]inter-actions with providers and residents were so well-valued and 
[normal]respected that we were frequently approached by landlords and landlord and tenant 
[normal]bodies to deliver it for them by special request.
[normal]To deliver our current vision and mission we intend to wo
[normal]rk with landlords and 
[normal]tenants to resolve disputes that come to us impartially using processes that are fair, 
[normal]evidence-based, and free of bias and prejudice. These principles of dispute 
[normal]resolution will be,the basis of 
[normal]our work with landlords, tenants, MPs, 
[normal]councillors, and 
[normal]tenant panels. We are developing an extended set of dispute resolution principles 
[normal]which will be augmented by complementary learning media. Working with all 
[normal]interested parties, we aim to achieve accessible dispute resolution that will be of
[normal] 
[normal]benefit to both landlords and tenants and encourage landlords to use these 
[normal]outcomes to improve the services they provide.
[normal]Governance:[bold]The Housing Act 1996 (Sch. 2., para.10) provides for the Ombudsman's Scheme to 
[normal]be administered by a body corporate or by 
[normal]a corporation sole. Until 1 April 2013 
[normal]there was a body corporate, IHO Limited, a company limited by guarantee and not 
[normal]trading for profit which, in 2006, was designated as an eNDPB. The Board 
[normal]comprised equal numbers of tenants, landlords, and independents 
[normal](the 'constituency 
[normal]model'). The Secretary of State made an order establishing The Housing 
[normal]Ombudsman as a corporation sole. As Ombudsman, Chief Executive, and
[normal] 
[normal]Accounting Officer, I am supported
[normal] by an Audit and Risk Committee. In accordance 
[normal]with an express provision in the Scheme I may set up a Panel of Advisors but such a 
[normal]group is not part of the governance of the corporation sole and advises me 
[normal]personally.
[normal]The principal reasons for changes in g
[normal]overnance were:
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]To support my independence as Ombudsman in the discharge of my 
[normal]statutory function;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]To remove 'double governance';
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]To reduce the costs (direct and indirect) of servicing two full governance 
[normal]structures;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]To remove the potential for conflict 
[normal]arising from my three roles;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The extension of jurisdiction under the Localism Act 2011;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]To reflect my future status as an office holder not an employee.
[normal]I turn now to the specific points raised in your letter. 
[normal]Harmonisation of Ombudsman Schemes [bold]Ease of ac[bold]cess:[bold]Two of the primary outcomes of our mission and vision are that tenants and 
[normal]landlords have increased trust in dispute resolution and designated persons are 
[normal]playing their part in resolving disputes fairly. It is important to understand that, for 
[normal]us, th
[normal]e 'increased trust' refers broadly to dispute resolution in rented housing that 
[normal]may be taking place locally between landlords and tenants or by designated persons as well as when it is escalated to me.
[normal]Achievem
[normal]ent of our strategic intent will deliver better access to dispute resolution for 
[normal]residents.
[normal]Many providers, especially since the coming into force of the Localism Act, have 
[normal]reduced 
[normal]their ICPs to two stages and many do not explicitly refer to 'stages' in an
[normal] attempt to resolve complaints and disputes without raising an expectation that all 
[normal]`stages' must be completed before resolution may be had. Such providers share with 
[normal]us the importance of early, local, appropriate, and proportionate dispute resolution.
[normal]Con[bold]fusion:[bold]My recent experience is that confusion about the ways in which people in my 
[normal]jurisdiction can complain has been caused by two principal factors. The first is the 
[normal]clumsy, complex, and clunky drafting of section 180 of the Localism Act. When I 
[normal]asked a
[normal] leading Housing Law QC for advice on certain aspects of this section one of 
[normal]his observations was that "it is clear that it is unclear". If this is the opinion of a QC 
[normal]landlords and tenants can be forgiven if they too are confused and probably explains why
[normal] myths such as that of the "8-week rule" occur.
[normal]Linked to this is the complete lack of communication by government of the 
[normal]consequences of legislation such as section 180 to people who will be affected by it.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We are all committed to achieving cost effectiveness and good value for money in 
[normal]these times of economic challenge and austerity but there is a strong case for 
[normal]certain, especially low-cost, exceptions. My Service does not have the resources to 
[normal]mount far-reaching communication exercises. Even if we did, we must seek an 
[normal]exemption from DCLG to spend money from our budget on, for instance, leaflets for 
[normal]tenants. Recently, for example, I put up a business case to spend £6,000 on such 
[normal]leaflets but, in 
[normal]line with Francis Maude's decrees concerning spending on marketing, 
[normal]promotion, and communication, was eventually granted an exemption to spend £4,000.
[normal]Given these systemic limitations on our ability to inform, our strategic approach is to 
[normal]work with others 
[normal](e.g. 
[normal]landlords, trade bodies, and others) to use their networks and 
[normal]resources to reach our customers.
[normal]Fitting alongside others:[bold]In terms of consultation and collaborative working the Localism Act adds the Housing 
[normal]Ombudsman to the list of bodies with whom 
[normal]the Local Government Ombudsmen (LGO) may consult during the course of their investigations. It also provides that if, 
[normal]at any stage in the course of conducting an investigation, I form the opinion that the 
[normal]complaint relates partly to a matter which could be
[normal] the subject of an investigation by 
[normal]the LGO, I must consult with the appropriate 'Commissioner' about the complaint 
[normal]and, if I consider it necessary, inform the complainant of the steps necessary to 
[normal]initiate a complaint with the LGO.
[normal]Provision is also made 
[normal]to enable me and the LGO to carry out joint investigations. In 
[normal]particular, if at any stage in the course of conducting an investigation I form the 
[normal]opinion that the complaint relates partly to a matter within the jurisdiction of the LGO, 
[normal]I [bold]may conduct an investigation jointly with the LGO provided I have first obtained the 
[normal]consent of the complainant or the complainant's representative. Moreover, if I form the opinion that a complaint which is being investigated by the LGO relates partly to 
[normal]a
[normal] matter within my jurisdiction, I may conduct an investigation jointly with the LGO 
[normal]and we may make joint reports so long as we distinguish my determinations from 
[normal]other findings or 
[normal]recommendations.
[normal]I am currently talking to the LGO about a memorandum of un
[normal]derstanding (MOU) that 
[normal]will help us provide a seamless, high quality service to our respective customers for 
[normal]those occasions, should they ever occur, when we might conduct joint investigations. 
[normal]There have not been any since 1 April 2013.
[normal]We do not have an 
[normal]MOU with the PHSO. To my knowledge we have not had a 
[normal]single case in which our jurisdictions have ever overlapped although sometimes 
[normal]people have contacted the PHSO about a matter within my jurisdiction and have 
[normal]been referred by them to me.
[normal]Sharing good prac[bold]tice with other Ombudsmen:[bold]My colleagues and I attend conferences and special interest groups arranged and 
[normal]supported by the Ombudsman Association. Although my predecessor decided to 
[normal]stop attending meetings of the Public Sector Ombudsmen Group because he, l
[normal]ike
[normal] 
[normal]me, considered the Housing Ombudsman to be, predominantly, a private sector ombudsman, I decided to accept Sir Tony Redmond's invitation to attend meetings of the group because I took the view that any opportunity to mix with other 
[normal]ombudsmen to share good 
[normal]practice, challenges, mutual concerns and interests, new 
[normal]developments, and emerging trends was of benefit to my Service.
[normal]My colleagues and I also meet other ombudsman and their colleagues at different 
[normal]levels for different purposes. In recent months, for ex
[normal]ample, I have had meetings with The Property Ombudsman, the Ombudsman (Property), the Pensions Ombudsman and the CEO of The Dispute Service. Colleagues have visited, for 
[normal]example, the Legal Ombudsman to share concerns and ambitions concerning data 
[normal]collectio
[normal]n and processing for accountability, improved organisational performance, 
[normal]and better customer service.
[normal]Single access point:[bold]I am instinctively but cautiously drawn to this concept by the obvious benefits 
[normal]especially to customers if it could be organised eff
[normal]ectively and efficiently. During the course of my nearly 13 years as an ombudsman I have been to many meetings in 
[normal]different 
[normal]fora 
[normal]to discuss the implementation of a 'single portal'. It remains, however, 
[normal]something of the 'holy grail' of ombudsmanry.
[normal]My conce
[normal]rns are:
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Will it deliver my strategic aims and their primary outcomes?
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]How is it going to be paid for?
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Will that be more expensive than my present arrangements that have been 
[normal]put in place following the fundamental review of our core process and role?
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]What 
[normal]control will 
[normal]I [bold]have over the quality of service provision?
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]What would be my rights to withdraw from such a service if it wasn't working 
[normal]to my satisfaction and to deliver my strategic aims?
[normal]Single PSOE:[bold]A single PSOE appears, superficially, to be a good thing but, from my point of view, it 
[normal]is another myth that has emerged from the mists of prejudice and assumption. To my knowledge it has never be subjected to what the judges call "nice chemical 
[normal]analysis".
[normal]Before I could support this idea I should need to be convinced by:
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Clearly set out aims, objectives, and outcomes;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A clearly set out, argued rationale as to why it would be an improvement on 
[normal]where we are now;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A cost-benefit analysis;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]An options appraisal;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]An audit of necessary changes to primary legislation;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]An informed and authoritative assessment of the likelihood of legislative 
[normal]changes and a clear indication of timescales;
[normal]• A comprehensive risk assessment.
[normal]I have had brief conversations with Julie Mellor and Jane Martin about this issue. I have made it clear to both that compelling evidence from the combination of the 
[normal]above list would be a 
[normal]sine qua non 
[normal]of my decision to support or not support the idea 
[normal]of a P
[normal]SOE. At my last meeting with Julie I made it clear that in the absence of such 
[normal]evidence I would not be able to form a considered view of the concept.
[normal]European Directive in Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)[bold]What consideration have you given to the introduction of the Directive and are [bold]you taking any action in response?[bold]"Appropriate/alternative"[bold]Although I get the point that the proposal applies to ADR that seeks to resolve 
[normal]disputes between consumers and trade
[normal]rs "out-of-court" it is a pity that the Directive 
[normal]defines ADR as 
[normal]Alternative 
[normal]Dispute Resolution rather than 
[normal]Appropriate 
[normal]because 
[normal]courts are sometimes the only 'appropriate' forum for the resolution of a dispute 
[normal](e.g. 
[normal]novel points of law, interpretation of t
[normal]he law, where remedies such as damages, 
[normal]injunction and specific performance are sought).
[normal]Common principles[bold]The Directive states that effective ADR procedures should be guided by a number of 
[normal]common principles, such as impartiality, transparency, effectivene
[normal]ss, and fairness. 
[normal]No ombudsman in the UK or Ireland will disagree with this statement except to say 
[normal]that the criteria set out by the Ombudsman Association (OA) for membership in the 
[normal]`ombudsman' category might go further than these criteria. The Cabinet off
[normal]ice and the Ministry of Justice have formally accepted and endorsed OA's extended criteria 
[normal]which are included in their joint guidance to government departments which are 
[normal]thinking of reviewing or setting up ombudsman schemes.
[normal]Cross-border complaints[bold]The int
[normal]ention of the Commission is to propose measures on ADR that ensure that all 
[normal]consumer complaints can be submitted to an ADR entity and that disputes arising from cross-border transactions and the digital environment may be more easily 
[normal]resolved. On the basis
[normal] of past experience, I do not expect my Service to be involved 
[normal]in any cross-border transaction in the terms of the proposal.
[normal]Digital environment[bold]The digital environment is of relevance to my Service and we plan further to develop 
[normal]our website but also to cr
[normal]eate a digital media communication strategy that will help 
[normal]us raise awareness of our services and also to enable easier and wider access to them. We acknowledge government's aspiration to achieve 'digital by default' and 
[normal]are seeking to work with others to overcome significant challenges facing residents 
[normal]in my jurisdiction to achieve it. Many, for instance, cannot afford telephone land lines 
[normal]and therefore have no access to broadband and the internet. Many others are
[normal] 
[normal]denied digital facilities by reason of their advanced age, ill-health and other frailty, or 
[normal]special needs.
[normal]The Directive will require Member States to ensure that all disputes between a 
[normal]consumer and a trader arising from the sale of 
[normal]goods or the provision of services can 
[normal]be submitted to an ADR entity, including through online means. Subject to the 
[normal]challenges referred to above, our new website is designed to be inter-active and, I 
[normal]believe, would already meet the Commission's requiremen
[normal]t.
[normal]Enhanced redress[bold]The second objective of the Directive to enhance redress for consumers is directly 
[normal]relevant to one of the aspects of my role but I cannot presently see how the Directive 
[normal]will actually enhance redress for residents, landlords, and managing agents in my 
[normal]jurisdiction.
[normal]Lack of awareness and uneven quality[bold]The Directive recounts that analysis of the current situation identified certain main 
[normal]shortcomings which hinder the effectiveness of ADR such as the lack of consumer 
[normal]and business awareness, and the uneven quality of ADR procedures.
[normal]Within the limits placed on us by government in terms of communicating to our customers, we shall continue to 
[normal]do all we can raise awareness of our Service. In 
[normal]particular we shall use our new website and will continue to work with landlords and 
[normal]their professional and trade bodies and with tenant organisations to get across 
[normal]messages about who we are, what we do, and
[normal] how we add value.
[normal]I am not in a position to comment on whether there is uneven quality of ADR 
[normal]procedures in the context of rented housing. I can say, however, that the quality of 
[normal]my Service has been consistently recognised and reflected in objective and 
[normal]u
[normal]nsolicited evidence.
[normal]Residual cross-sectoral entity[bold]Apart from my comments about private-for-profit landlords and managing agents being required to join my Scheme, I presently have no views on a residual cross
[normal]&#xad;
[normal]sectoral 
[normal]entity.
[normal]Complaints filed by traders a[bold]gainst consumers[bold]The Commission's proposal covers disputes between consumers and traders (the 
[normal]latter being defined as "any natural persons or any legal person, irrespective of 
[normal]whether privately or publicly owned, who is acting, including through any person
[normal] 
[normal]acting in his name or on his behalf, for purposes relating to his trade, business, craft 
[normal]or profession arising from the sale of goods or the provision of services") and 
[normal]includes complaints filed by consumers against traders as well as complaints filed by 
[normal]traders against consumers. In the context of the Housing Ombudsman and assuming 
[normal]that the definition of "trader" includes landlords, there would have to be a change in 
[normal]primary legislation to allow landlords to trigger disputes coming to me.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Accessible information about ADR providers [bold]The proposal states:
[normal]"When disputes arise, consumers must be able to quickly identify which ADR 
[normal]entities are competent to deal with their dispute. To this end, this proposal 
[normal]ensures that consumers will be able to find information on the competent ADR entity in the main commercial documents provided by the trader and, where a 
[normal]trader has a website, on that website. In addition, traders will have to inform 
[normal]consumers on whether or
[normal] not they commit to use ADR in relation to 
[normal]complaints lodged against them by a consumer. This obligation will act as an 
[normal]incentive for traders to use ADR more frequently."
[normal]To the 
[normal]extent that "traders" includes landlords in my jurisdiction, these criteria are met. Some landlords even make clear in their tenancy agreements residents' rights 
[normal]to escalate disputes. If for-profit private-sector landlords and managing agents were 
[normal]required
[normal] to join my Scheme as a result of the Directive, I have the power in the 
[normal]approved Scheme to require the same criteria of them.
[normal]Costs, length, and complexity[bold]I am confident that the fundamental changes we have made recently to our 
[normal]procedures and practices i
[normal]ncluding, especially, our re-engineered core dispute 
[normal]resolution process and strategic re-alignment of resources linked to an activity-based 
[normal]costing model will meet the following requirement of the Commission's proposal:
[normal]`ADR procedures should be effective 
[normal]and address certain shortcomings 
[normal]associated with court procedures, such as costs, length and complexity."
[normal]Resolution within 90 days[bold]Since we have re-aligned our resources to deliver early local dispute resolution we 
[normal]are completing cases in minutes, days, o
[normal]r weeks and would expect in the majority of 
[normal]cases to satisfy the Commission's requirement that:
[normal]" Based on the results of existing studies, the present proposal requires that 
[normal]disputes should be resolved within 90 days."
[normal]The addition of the word "generally" later in the text satisfies me that 90 days is a 
[normal]desirable rather than an absolute and permits flexibility and discretion to produce a 
[normal]just outcome in appropriate cases such as, for instance, novel or complex cases, 
[normal]ins
[normal]tances involving systemic issues, or matters containing important learning 
[normal]outcomes for the sector or in the public interest.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Free of charge[bold]The proposal states that:
[normal]"In order to ensure that ADR procedures remain accessible to all 
[normal]consumers,
[normal]the present proposal provides that they should be free of charge or of 
[normal]moderate cost for consumers."
[normal]The services of my organisation are free to residents at the point of complaint. 
[normal]Competent authorities[bold]It is proposed that, in each Member State
[normal], a competent authority will be in charge of monitoring the functioning of ADR entities established on its territory. The competent authorities will, 
[normal]inter alia, 
[normal]assess, on the basis of information notified to them by ADR 
[normal]entities, whether a given ADR enti
[normal]ty respects the quality requirements laid down by the present proposal.
[normal]It is not clear to me how such an arrangement would align with my existing duty 
[normal]under statute to report annually to the Secretary of State who lays the report before 
[normal]Parliament. If it 
[normal]means double reporting there will be an unnecessarily bureaucratic 
[normal]process and a risk that resources that would be better directed to providing an improved service to consumers will be needlessly spent on duplication.
[normal]It seems to me that where reports are 
[normal]laid before Parliament they are documents of 
[normal]public record and this requirement should be enough to meet the requirements of the 
[normal]Directive. Equally, the public availability of such reports should be enough to enable:
[normal]" the competent authorities to publish regular reports on the development and 
[normal]functioning of ADR entities. Every three years, the Commission will report to 
[normal]the European Parliament and the Council on the application of the Directive".
[normal]To what extent do you [bold]believe the Directive will allow better and meaningful [bold]comparisons in performance and sharing of practice across providers or agencies?[bold]I do not believe that the Directive will allow better comparisons in performance. Ombudsmen in the UK, for instance, hav
[normal]e tried in a variety of networking 
[normal]fora 
[normal]to 
[normal]make 
[normal]such comparisons but their constitutional arrangements, core processes, and 
[normal]related performance measures, or KPIs, or targets are so disparate that comparison 
[normal]inevitably fails to get apples and pears to coinc
[normal]ide.
[normal]Subject to my fears of duplication and unnecessary costs referred to above, I do 
[normal]believe, however, that "competent authorities" and the collation of reporting 
[normal]mechanisms by the Commission to the European Parliament will provide the 
[normal]potential for a fra
[normal]mework to facilitate sharing of good practice.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]To what extent do you think the Directive presents an opportunity to remodel [bold]the existing system of ADR to resolve possible existing overlaps, shortfalls, [bold]and conflicts?[bold]The Directive states that another of the main shortcomings which hinders the 
[normal]effectiveness of ADR is "gaps in the coverage". The most obvious gap in terms of 
[normal]my jurisdiction is the fact that the vast majority of consumers of services provided by 
[normal]private, f
[normal]or-profit landlords and managing agents are excluded from access to my 
[normal]Service, and, therefore, justice, in respect of unsatisfactory provision of those 
[normal]services for which they pay market rents. These consumers have for too long been 
[normal]the Cinderellas at the
[normal] ADR ball. Government strongly supports the role of the private 
[normal]sector in the provision of rented housing. Giving tenants in this sector the right to 
[normal]escalate their disputes to the Housing Ombudsman would not only give them the 
[normal]rights of access to ADR requ
[normal]ired by the Directive and thereby access to out-of-court 
[normal]justice but would also test standards in that sector and drive up the quality of 
[normal]customer service by reference to an ever-increasing body of learning arising out of a 
[normal]rich bank of ombudsman decision-
[normal]outcomes.
[normal]How can those involved in dispute resolution, but who aren't covered by the Directive, ensure that they are meeting the same expected standards of quality [bold]as those who are covered by it?[bold]As stated above, Ombudsman members of OA will not have diff
[normal]iculty meeting the 
[normal]standards. Indeed, many of us, no doubt, will be able to argue that we exceed them.
[normal]I suspect that the simple answer to this question is that those who are not covered 
[normal]by the Directive should ensure, by amendment and revision if necessar
[normal]y, that their 
[normal]constitutional arrangements meet the standards. This will be a matter, as may be 
[normal]appropriate, for their Boards, councils, regulators, departmental sponsors, industry 
[normal]stakeholders, and, ultimately, government.
[normal]How can the government ensure aga[bold]inst the proliferation of excessive [bold]numbers of different dispute resolution bodies and mechanisms (and should it [bold]be doing so)?[bold]This is definitely something in respect of which the government should be taking a 
[normal]lead. The proliferation of different ombudsmen and other dispute resolution bodies 
[normal]in the same or similar industries, sectors, or businesses is very confusing to consumers and does not 
[normal]serve them well in terms of straightforward access to 
[normal]justice.
[normal]Governme
[normal]nt should ensure that the OA guidance endorsed by the Cabinet Office 
[normal]and the Ministry of Justice is followed by its departments. One valuable contribution 
[normal]to this outcome would be that all legislation setting up or reviewing ombudsmen or 
[normal]other ADR schemes 
[normal]should be subject to a pre-condition of approval by Cabinet 
[normal]Office advised by Treasury Solicitors.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Specific action[bold]I have decided not to take any immediate action in response to the Directive 
[normal]principally because I cannot see any obvious impact on my Service particularly in the 
[normal]context of efforts to "improve the functioning of the retail internal market".
[normal]For the moment, I have decided to keep in close contact with fellow ombudsmen, especially t
[normal]hose in the private sector, and monitor how the introduction of the 
[normal]Directive develops and take any action as may be necessary.
[normal]Given that my Service's mission is "impartial dispute resolution for the whole rented sector", I shall be alert to any opportuni
[normal]ty afforded by the Directive to argue that the 
[normal]whole of the rented housing sector (including the private, for-profit sector) should be included in my jurisdiction.
[normal]I [bold]hope that this contribution is helpful to you and your Committee. Please contact my office
[normal] if you need any additional information. I should be very happy to meet you at 
[normal]the House of Commons or at my office if you would like to discuss these matters 
[normal]further.
