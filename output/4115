[normal]Written evidence submitted by Roger Farrow [FBB0047][bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Executive Summary[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]This submission claims that:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.0 [bold]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1 This submission is made by Roger Farrow, retired NHS manager, 
[normal]in a personal capacity 
[normal]to express his profound dissatisfaction with the BBC and to press for:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.0 Current status of the BBC[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1 The BBC is
[normal], allegedly,
[normal] the
[normal] 
[normal]largest broadcaster in the world
[normal] 
[normal]in terms of staff employed
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]It is an anachronism, grown 
[normal]to its current 
[normal]dominan
[normal]t size
[normal] 
[normal]thanks to
[normal] 
[normal]nearly 70 years 
[normal]of
[normal] generous
[normal] income derived 
[normal]mostly 
[normal]from a TV
[normal]/radio
[normal] licen
[normal]s
[normal]ing system enforced by the criminal law.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2 The huge siz
[normal]e of the BBC 
[normal]is
[normal] inappropriate in the digital age
[normal] since its function can be achieved in 
[normal]cheaper, 
[normal]more flexible and fairer ways
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.0 Market dominance by the BBC[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1 
[normal]It is suggested that a
[normal]pproximately 70% of the 
[normal]UK
[normal] population
[normal] 
[normal]still 
[normal]get most of their news from television and approximately 7
[normal]0
[normal]% of those viewers use the BBC.
[normal] 
[normal]If true, t
[normal]his market dominance is unhealthy
[normal] and
[normal] does not 
[normal]encourage diversity of journalistic viewpoints.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal] T
[normal]he BBC 
[normal]also 
[normal]h
[normal]as a large and powerful website where 
[normal]entertainment and 
[normal]information are 
[normal]offered
[normal] free. Private sector 
[normal]media companies
[normal] find it difficult to establish pay to view websites in the face of this 
[normal]unfair 
[normal]competition.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.0 Accountability of the BBC[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1 
[normal]Recent
[normal] scandals such as the Jimmy 
[normal]Savile
[normal] affair, 
[normal]Lonely Planet sell off, 
[normal]Newsnight
[normal] blunders, excessive 
[normal]senior staff
[normal] pay offs and the Digital Master Index fiasco, demonstrate the BBC to be an inward looking
[normal], self
[normal]-
[normal]serving
[normal] 
[normal]and complacent 
[normal]organisation that is out of touch with its customers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].2 
[normal]The t
[normal]heoretical accountability
[normal] of the BBC
[normal] to the public 
[normal]is 
[normal]meaningless
[normal] 
[normal]becaus
[normal]e it
[normal] leaves
[normal] 
[normal]TV 
[normal]licence fee payer
[normal]s
[normal] without 
[normal]the option of “voting with their feet
[normal]”
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]The BBC
[normal] 
[normal]simply
[normal] 
[normal]tells 
[normal]individual 
[normal]complain
[normal]ants
[normal] that their concerns
[normal] have been noted
[normal].
[normal] In other words, they 
[normal]have
[normal] become a 
[normal]mere 
[normal]statistic
[normal] with 
[normal]no
[normal] hope of 
[normal]bringing about change 
[normal]within the BBC
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3 The only 
[normal]practical 
[normal]way that TV licence 
[normal]fee payers
[normal] can 
[normal]hold
[normal] the BBC 
[normal]to 
[normal]account is to 
[normal]be 
[normal]able
[normal] to take their m
[normal]oney 
[normal]elsewhere 
[normal]and spend it with another 
[normal]broadcaster
[normal]. 
[normal]In the 21
[normal]st
[normal] century, t
[normal]his is 
[normal]a
[normal] sanction that any 
[normal]customer 
[normal]of a 
[normal]broadcasting 
[normal]service should be able to deploy. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4 Approximately 10% of all criminal charges
[normal] in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] 
[normal]arise from
[normal] the 
[normal]prosecution of viewers who do not wish to pay the TV licence fee.  Th
[normal]is
[normal] use of the criminal law is uniquely punitive in the 
[normal]media market
[normal] because the TV licence fee is effectively a tax
[normal]. 
[normal]The BBC should move 
[normal]without delay 
[normal]to a
[normal] subscription service which 
[normal]can 
[normal]simply 
[normal]be
[normal] withdrawn if a subscriber fails to keep up payments.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.0 Dangers of market dominance by the BBC[bold]&#xa0;[bold]5.1
[normal] The dominant 
[normal]size
[normal] of the BBC stifles
[normal] the 
[normal]UK
[normal] media market
[normal] and
[normal] poses a threat to democracy
[normal].  T
[normal]he
[normal] BBC, just like every other 
[normal]media organisation
[normal],
[normal] is guilty of
[normal] 
[normal]bias
[normal] and
[normal] 
[normal]spin
[normal]. 
[normal]I
[normal]t is
[normal] therefore
[normal] vital that 
[normal]UK
[normal] 
[normal]citizens have a wide choice of broadcasters and internet 
[normal]sources
[normal] to choos
[normal]e from.  
[normal]This
[normal] enables citizens to
[normal] detect 
[normal]institutional 
[normal]bias by 
[normal]compar
[normal]ing
[normal] and 
[normal]cross referenc
[normal]ing
[normal] 
[normal]not just 
[normal]the coverage of news items
[normal] and current affairs but also
[normal] 
[normal]the depiction of political 
[normal]issues
[normal] 
[normal]embedded 
[normal]within 
[normal]all broadcast subjects
[normal] e
[normal].
[normal]g
[normal].
[normal] comedy
[normal],
[normal] drama
[normal] and history programmes
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.0 [bold]Public service broadcasting[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]6.1 The current scale of public service broadcasting is inappropriate in the digital age.  There is no
[normal] longer any
[normal] justification for funding popular entertainment programmes from a
[normal] flat rate
[normal] 
[normal]TV 
[normal]licensing system enforced by the criminal law. The media market should be used to
[normal] fund these 
[normal]popular 
[normal]programmes through voluntary subscriptions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2 The scope and quantity of public service broadcasting should be reviewed
[normal].  Fixed term contracts for public
[normal] service
[normal] 
[normal]broadcasting should then be allocated by a public broadcasting authority to a
[normal] range of
[normal] reputable broadcaster
[normal]s who are 
[normal]willing to provide content that the market 
[normal]will not fund.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.3 Public service broadcasting should be funded from general taxation
[normal] at a level agreed annually by Parliament.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7[bold].0 Conclusion[bold]&#xa0;[bold]7
[normal].1 The 
[normal]ubiquity of digital television
[normal] 
[normal]and the
[normal] 
[normal]increasing use of the internet
[normal] require a new paradigm of public service broadcasting.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2 
[normal]T
[normal]he BBC 
[normal]should
[normal] be
[normal] treated just like any other broadcaste
[normal]r and required to obtain its income from a combination of fixed term contracts for public service broadcasting and voluntary subscriptions for 
[normal]popular 
[normal]entertainment.
