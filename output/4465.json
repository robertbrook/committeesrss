"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written evidence from \nHertfordshire County Council\n (LTD0027)\n&#xa0;\nInquiry for local decision making on transport expenditure&#xa0;\n1.              Response summary1.1\n              \nIn general, Hertfordshire County Council is supportive of the devolution of transport expenditure to a more local level. \nHowever, \nthis is in part subject to there being a consistency in this devolved funding arrangement\n to enable a greater stability for the planning of transport expenditure at a local level to support \nlong-term sustained \ngrowth. The \nc\nouncil would \nalso be supportive of greater devolution to a local level, as while a level of funding has been devolved ther\ne remains an element of centralised priority setting that may, on occasion, be in conflict with well established, evidence-based locally supported improvements.\n              \nT\nhe council does \nalso \nhave some concern regarding the \nability of the level of funding availabl\ne through devolved\n arrangements to be able to support large projects of national or sub-national importance\n in local areas\n. The main points that the council wishes to express are:\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n              \nThe below addresses each point identified by the Committee in turn.\n2.              What is the rationale for the Government’s proposals to devolve to a local level decision-making on transport expenditure? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Government’s approach? Are there better models?&#xa0;2.1\n              \nThe rationale for the Government’s proposals to devolve decision-making on transport expenditure to a local level is to enable lo\ncal people and organisations, through elected representatives\n, \nstatutory bodies\n and business representatives (through LEPs)\n, to have a greater say in how \nfunding is spent at a local level\n. The County Council welcomes this general principle.\n2.2\n              \nThe \ndevolution of transport expenditure to local level decision-making organisations allows for their local knowledge and experience to be applied and used more directly to overcome local issues. This provides for a local assessment and application of a projec\nts benefits at a local level against locally relevant criteria, while still enabling wider national priorities to be taken in to account (although with less influence on final funding decisions).\n2.3\n              \nThe stability of this devolved funding is critical to th\ne long-term success of local decision making for transport expenditure. Having overcome initial challenges, as identified below, to develop effective organisations and structures, \nit is important that \ndevolved funding at a local level \nis maintained to \nsupp\nort longer-term priority setting, programme management and delivery to address local barriers to growth.\n2.4\n              \nThe council would, additionally, support a greater level of devolved funding and decision making to further enhance local accountability.\n While the\n current level of devolved funding and decision making is to be welcomed, there remains an element of centralised priority setting that may, on occasion, be in conflict with well established, evidence-based locally supported improvements. The council would\n, therefore, support a greater level of devolution to be considered that provided for a greater level of local decision making with less prescription from Government.\n2.5\n              \nA \nkey challenge with\n this approach has been in ensuring that local statutory bodies a\nnd decision makers have \nthe capacity\n and specialist staff\n to enable them to be able to\n take on roles \neffectively \npreviously undertaken by the Government and Regional Bodies, namely the\n manage\nment\n, prioritis\nation\n, and allocat\nion of\n funding for local transpo\nrt schemes. However, this was primarily an issue as a result of \nsome of \nthese organisation\ns\n only having recently been established and going through a process of acquiring the expertise or working with other organisations, such as the County Council, who ar\ne able to assist them. This approach has enabled this initial \nchallenge\n \nto be addressed and provide the basis for establishing effective working relationships at a local level through the sharing of skills and expertise.\n2.6\n              \nAn approach that local level \ndecision-making bodies are taking in Hertfordshire, building on the Government’s model, is to engage\n \nwith neighbouring areas to ensure that wider network enhancements are fully understood for the impact they will have on the county. This has additionally e\nnabled local statutory bodies to contribute to the \ndevelopment of neighbouring\n Counties’\n plans that are influenced by transport within the county, while in the same regard allowing our neighbours to contribute to the development of Hertfordshire’s.\n&#xa0;\n3.              Do local bodies (including local authorities, local enterprise partnerships, passenger transport executives, integrated transport authorities and local transport boards) have the capacity to assess, prioritise and deliver local transport schemes? What would the optimum delivery body look like?&#xa0;\n3.1\n              \nAs indicated in the answer to our previous questions, the council and other local bodies have been able to manage the recent changes in local decision making on transport expenditure through the sharing of expertise\n in the development of local \ntransport \nplans and priorities.\n \n3.\n2\n              \nLocal Transport Authorities are already \nwell-placed\n \nto\n form the \nfoundation\n \nof local\n \ndelivery bodies. For example, Hertfordshire County Council \nhas, in partnership with local bodies, the capacity to assess and prioritise local transport schemes, and has a demonstrable record in the ability to manage and deliver projects on time and budget. This includes, for example, working with a number of local\n partners to deliver \nschemes such as \nthe \nBaldock Bypass and Royston Rail Crossing\n.\n \n3.3\n              \nThe Local Transport Body model is therefore a good starting point for an optimum delivery body in that it contains both a clear democratically-elected accountable body \n(i.e. the Local Transport Authority), and contains all the relevant partners required to identify, prioritise and deliver transport schemes.\n4.              What is the best way of dealing with major transport schemes that cross local authority boundaries or have wider regional impact?&#xa0;4.1\n              \nT\nhe council and \nits local \npartners have been engaging with neighbouring local decision-making bodies\n on specific schemes that impact on both \nourselves and the neighbouring c\nouncil(s) in question\n.\n4.2\n              \nThe council \ntherefore \nbelieves th\nat the best approach should be\n neig\nh\nbouring\n local bodies forming \nscheme-specific\n \ndelivery\n groups based on functional economic/travel to work areas to address the impact of\n specific\n \nscheme \nproposal\ns\n on wider travel patterns.\n An example is the delivery group\n formed to deliver Croxley Rail Link, which comprises both Hertfordshire authorities and London-based transport authorities.\n5.              How effectively do local bodies work with each other and with Government departments and national transport agencies?&#xa0;\n5.1\n              \nThe County Council considers that it works well with local bodies and the Department for Transport. \nThe devolution of transport funding to local decision-making bodies has provided further opportunities for the council and partner local organisation to bui\nld on existing relationships to develop closer working relationships and the sharing of best practice, skills and expertise. This has also supported a closer working relationship with Government departments and agencies\n.\n \nIt should be \nacknowledged\n that\n \nther\ne is an increased demand on the Government \nduring this time \nwhen local bodies are seeking clarity and guidance in trying to understand the evolving mechanisms\n for local transport funding\n,\n and\n there is\n \nsubsequently a \nclear\n \nchallenge for Government\n \nregarding\n \nthe amount of \nsupportive\n \nresource \nthat\n \nits\n \ndepartments and agencies are able to contribute \nto\n \nlocal level\ns\n when there is a wide-spread national demand for greater engagement\n, guidance\n and input.\n6.              Do the current funding streams for major local transport schemes meet the needs of local authorities? How do current funding streams compare with previous arrangements?&#xa0;\n6.1\n              \nWhile a significant amount of funding \nis being\n \nallocated through the Single Local Growth Fund\n to enable local decision-making bodies to imp\nlement a wide and cross-cutting number of measures\n across all sectors\n, there is a concern that without any \nspecific \nring-fenc\ning for\n transport that this could place networks under greater pressure in the medium to long-term\n if transport schemes are not prioritised \nin Strategic Economic Plans\n. \nWhilst nationally t\nhe level of funding that has been allocated\n for major schemes\n \nwil\nl\n be\n \nmore per annum \nfrom 2015/16 \nthan \nprevious \nyears\n, the level of funding that is available \nmay stil\nl\n \nnot allow for the future development of \nlarge \nprojects \nneeded for sub-national or national reasons in a local area, \nwithout severely impacting on the funding of other local priority\n schemes in that\n area.\n6.2\n              \nThe Government may want to consider the develo\npment of an additional supplementary funding stream that would support the delivery of projects that have wider sub-national or national benefits. Alternatively, the Government may want to consider the development of an additional supplementary fund that c\nould act as ‘pump priming’ for infrastructure of this scale, that could be re-paid from \na locally agreed mechanism (e.g.\n \nthrough increased revenue that the\n infrastructure would be anticipated to \nrecoup\n)\n. The latter suggestion places a significant financial\n burden onto one local delivery partnership, and so may only want to be considered where a number of local decision-mak\ners\n have indicated support for the proposal. This would, however, lead to a significant risk in delivering the required large scale infra\nstructure where neighbouring local priorities conflicted with those at a local, sub-national and national level.\n7.              What impact will the devolution in 2015 of funding to Local Transport Bodies and the introduction of the Single Local Growth Fund have?&#xa0;\n7.1\n              \nThe impact of the devolution of funding to LTBs and the introduction of the SLGF to LEPs is primarily providing greater decision making and accountability at a local level. The impact of the SLGF itself will enable funding to be prioritised by local bodie\ns to address key \neconomic \nissues that impact residents and organisations at a local level and to support the growth, prosperity and wellbeing of those living and working in Hertfordshire.\n It should be noted however that \nlocal \ntransport schemes are not alwa\nys designed solely to support economic growth, and the County Council’\ns Local Transport P\nlan also advocates the delivery of measures to improve health, improve air quality, reduce accidents and reduce carbon emissions. There will still be a need to fund th\nese \ntypes of \nscheme, even if they don’t necessarily achieve the \neconomic \ngoals of the SLGF\n, and therefore funding should be retained to allow for this\n.\n7.2\n              \nThe primary concern with the devolution of funding is the potential limitations this may place on to\n the ability to deliver large infrastructure projects of sub-national and/or national importance. Without additional funding sources from local government, it becomes important for decision-making bodies, for example LTBs and LEPs, to be able to ‘bank’ mon\ney and to ‘save’ for the delivery of large infrastructure between funding periods without pressure from Government or its departments and agencies.\n8.              How can local authorities attract greater investment from the private sector for the delivery and maintenance of local transport infrastructure? What scope is there for the use of alternative funding streams?&#xa0;\n8.1\n              \nAn\n effective way for local authorities to attract private sector investment is through supporting a sustainable level of growth and securing fundin\ng through S106/CIL arrangements. The council has also been successful in securing investment from private sector transport operators by securing matched-funding, in particular the LSTF award has enabled partnership working with Arriva in \nWatford\n. Following\n the council’s investment of the LSTF in \nWatford\n to improve public transport infrastructure and the development of a Quality Network Partnership, Arriva invested almost £1.1 million that supported the delivery of 10 new buses. By working effectively with p\nrivate sector partners, local authorities should be able to secure third party funding where they are supporting improvements to services that provide mutual benefits.\n8.2\n              \nAdditional alternative funding sources that have the potential to provide greater co\nllaboration within the public and private sector include working with health care professionals and organisations to support healthier lifestyle choices.\n9.              How clear are the lines of accountability for local decision making on transport expenditure?&#xa0;\n9.1\n              \nT\nhe lines of accountability for local decision making on transport expenditure\n, in particular the Single Local Growth Fund,\n are still being developed\n,\n as polices and strategies of local decision-making bodies\n (e.g. the LEP’s Strategic Economic Plan)\n are be\ning developed\n and the emerging guidance from Government is being formulated\n. However, in general, this\n work\n \nin Hertfordshire \nis progressing to ensure that accountability is clear between delivery partners, stakeholders, and local residents and businesses.\n \nWithin these arrangements, it is important that there is a clear accountable body, which has a democratic mandate to take decisions.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2\n013\n6\n&#xa0;\n"
