[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Our “Mozal” aluminium smelter in Mozambique is a good illustration of how investments by the natural resources industry can support broader economic development.&#xa0;In 1998 Mozambique was emerging from 17 years of civil war and making the difficult transition to a market based economy.  The country was hampered by weak institutions, few people had the training to build or work at a plant like Mozal, and malaria was endemic.  &#xa0;Development of the project was backed by the Mozambique government, the UK, the EU and the World Bank to help:&#xa0;With a budget of $1.2 billion, the project was the largest ever foreign investment and largely achieved its goals. Mozambique is expected to become a middle income country and has received substantial overseas investment in recent years. &#xa0;Mozal has made a significant contribution to this progress. The smelter has contributed 3-6% of the country’s GDP each year.  It employs 1200 people and 600 contractors directly and contributes to indirect job creation of approximately 6500 people.  Thousands of people have trained at Mozal and 93% of its employees are from Mozambique. The government is a shareholder and receives a proportional share of dividends.&#xa0;Last year, Mozal spent approximately $460 million with local businesses, including over 150 small suppliers that were established with support from Mozlink – an enterprise development program implemented by BHP Billiton to help spread the benefits of development.  The construction of Mozal also supported the construction of new power lines bringing power from South Africa to Mozambique providing reliable power to the south of the country supporting development more broadly.&#xa0;The company’s successful healthcare programs have reduced the incidence of malaria in the local community from over 85% to less than 6%; and cut the HIV infection rate from 19% to 5%.  &#xa0;In addition, The Mozal Community Development Trust (MCDT) was established by BHP Billiton in 2000 and has initiated roughly 200 projects, focusing on quality of life, increasing access to healthcare, clean water and sanitation and poverty alleviation.&#xa0;Working with NGOs&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Conclusion&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Trends in the Mining and Metals Industry, International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), 2012 Excludes employee taxes Transparency in Corporate Reporting, Transparency International, 2012
