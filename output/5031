defaultINTRODUCTIONdefault1. The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) represents the 22 local authorities in Wales, and the three national park authorities and the three fire and rescue authorities are associate members.
default&#xa0;
default2. It seeks to provide representation to local authorities within an emerging policy framework that satisfies the key priorities of our members and delivers a broad range of services that add value to Welsh Local Government and the communities they serve.
default&#xa0;
defaultPolice and Crime Commissionersdefault&#xa0;
default3. The WLGA was opposed to the introduction of Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs), believing that Police Authorities operated well in Wales. Members were also concerned at the level of power being placed in the hands of a single individual and there was also the view that there was a risk that the Police and Crime Panels would have ‘no teeth’ in holding a PCC to account. However, following the passage of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act, the WLGA has been committed to seeking to ensure that the new system of police governance and accountability works as effectively as possible. As the representative body of local government in Wales, the WLGA is keen to ensure that the successful relationship and partnership working between Councils and the Police continues to grow and deliver for the people of Wales into the future in creating safer communities. Following their election in 2012, the WLGA has met with the PCCs in Wales and both parties were in agreement that local government is a critical partner in the community safety and crime reduction agenda.
default&#xa0;
default4. Whilst these meeting have been productive and positive, the relationship between the WLGA and PCCs is greatly different from that with the former Police Authorities, where as Associate members of the Association, we were able to undertake considerable joint working and policy development with the Police Authorities of Wales (PAW). Members of the Association have considered extending an invitation to PCCs to become Associate members. However, after careful consideration Members felt that more time was needed to fully understand the role and priorities of Commissioners and how this may impact on local government. In addition, Members were of the view that the Commission on Public Service Governance and Delivery in Wales would also influence the future shape of public services in Wales
default. As such, members agreed to defer a decision on PCC associate membership of the WLGA but 
defaultreiterated their firm wish to continue working closely with the Commissioners on crime and policing matters.
default&#xa0;
default5. Local authority leaders are committed to working in partnership with Commissioners and police colleagues to tackle and reduce crime and disorder and in promoting the safety of our communities through effective joint working with the police and other partners. Following the elections in 2012, meetings between Leaders, Chief Executives and Commissioners have taken place across Wales, with the aim of helping to develop positive working relationships and to recognise the importance of the role local authorities undertake in helping to create safer communities, prevent or deter people from crime or getting involved in anti-social behaviour (including children and young people) and in reducing crime and disorder.
default&#xa0;
default6. Community Safety Partnerships (CSPs), Youth Offending Teams (YOTs) and Local
defaultService Boards (LSBs) play a key role in addressing local priorities, needs and concerns regarding matters of crime and disorder and anti-social behaviour and it is imperative that there is effective and efficient communication, understanding and close working between them and PCCs.
default&#xa0;
default7. While joint working and positive relationships are being built between PCCs and Local Authorities /CSPs in the main, there is some concern that there is perhaps a lack of understanding on the part of some PCCs as to the local partnership landscape and the various roles and responsibilities held therein in some areas. This has resulted in some misunderstandings and tension, particularly between the PCC and the local CSP.
default&#xa0;
default8. In the first year, in terms of the impact on the funding of CSPs, many areas have received the same level of funding as before Home Office funding was transferred to PCCs. Some areas, however, have reported that there has been a decrease in funding at the local level, with a greater focus on work at the regional level (often police force areas, which span a number of local authorities). Additionally, a number of CSPs have reported that late notification of budgets and grants is to manage and plan effectively and can pose a risk to existing projects. Now that PCCs are more established we will wait and see what level of funding will be provided to CSPs for the next and future financial years. There is a risk that diminished funding could negatively impact on the role of CSPs in the future.
default&#xa0;
defaultPolice and Crime Panelsdefault&#xa0;
default9. The Association works closely to support the four Police and Crime Panels (PCPs) in Wales and hosts a regular meeting with the PCP Lead Officers and representatives of the Home Office in Wales to discuss the work of PCPs in Wales, share learning and experience and to consider any issues or concerns they may have. The WLGA, along with the LGA, held a briefing session about the expected role of PCPs prior to the establishment of Panels in 2012 and also hosted a Training and Development Day for PCP members and officers in July 2013. This event was met very positively by members and as such we will be looking to hold a similar event in 2014.
default&#xa0;
default10. The WLGA believes that PCPs are an integral component in the new police governance and accountability structures. PCPs should play an important role in holding PCCs to account and for scrutinising their activities. During the passage of the PRASR Act through Parliament, the Association argued that in order to be effective in their role, PCPs needed to possess adequate powers and also be adequately funded; ‘light touch’ scrutiny as proposed by the Home Office is not satisfactory given the wide ranging powers exercised by PCCs. While some concessions were granted e.g. the power of veto over the precept, it is still felt that PCPs require stronger powers in order to undertake their role effectively. Under the current arrangements, PCPs in the main can only make recommendations to PCCs and there is no obligation for the PCC to accept these. Similarly, while a PCP can veto a proposed precept or appointment of a Chief Constable, the power of veto is weak. For example, in relation to the precept, the PCC is only obliged to offer a second revised precept which the Panel has no right of veto over.
default&#xa0;
default11. The different legal status of PCPs in Wales, owing to the decision by the National Assembly not to grant legislative consent has also had some negative effects on PCPs. Firstly, due to their status in Wales, PCPs are unable to access general funds to support their work. The limited funding available to PCPs in Wales is proving to be a hindrance to the effective operation of Panels. Panels, in effect, are only funded to hold 4-5 meetings per annum. During their first year, Panels in the main were focussed on core business such as approving Police and Crime Plans, approving the Budget and holding confirmation hearings. However, as Panels are maturing they are meeting more regularly, they are seeking to become more proactive and developing forward work plans with a greater focus on scrutiny. It is feared, however, that the lack of resources could hamper this important development. PCPs require greater levels of funding and flexibility regarding how funding is used than is available under current grant arrangements.
default&#xa0;
default12. It is also felt that the administration of the grant to PCPs is overly bureaucratic and burdensome, with claims having to be submitted quarterly. Given the relatively small amount of funding in question, the WLGA believes that it would be more efficient for the funding claims to be made on an annual basis.
default&#xa0;
default13. The status of PCPs in Wales as free-standing bodies appointed by the Home Secretary, can also have a negative impact on their operation in other ways. For example, any changes to membership have to be approved by the Home Secretary, but this can be a time-consuming process especially if the change occurs during a period of Parliamentary recess.
default&#xa0;
default14. In terms of the relationship between the PCPs and PCCs in Wales, this is generally viewed positively. The PCPs have been working hard to build a constructive relationship with the PCCs over the past year and overall a considerable amount of progress has been made. PCPs have experienced some key issues during the first year, however, and these are set out below:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultConclusiondefault&#xa0;
default15. The advent of PCCs and PCPs has seen one of the biggest changes to local police governance and accountability for decades. During this first year, local authorities and CSPs in Wales have been seeking to work closely with PCCs on their shared interests. PCPs in Wales are also operating well and are beginning to mature in their roles. However, in order for PCPs do be truly effective and to offer the level of scrutiny required in the new system, greater resource and powers are needed. Additionally, it is important that the key work of CSPs is not undermined in the new system and that the links between local government and local policing are maintained.

defaultIn April 2013, the First Minister established the Commission on Public Service Governance and Delivery in order to provide those involved in delivering services, those politically accountable for them, and users of them to examine how public services are governed. The Commission will report on its findings at the end of the year.
