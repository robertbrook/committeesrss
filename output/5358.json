"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Wildlife and Countryside Link &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n1.1.\n&#xa0; \nWildlife and Countryside Link (Link) brings together 42 voluntary organisations concerned with the conservation and protection of wildlife, countryside and the marine environment. Our members practise and advocate environmentally sensitive land management, and encourage respect for and enjoyment of natural landscapes and features, the historic and marine environment and biodiversity. Taken together\n,\n our members have the support of over eight million people in the UK and manage over 690,000 hectares of land.\n&#xa0;1.2.\n&#xa0; \nLink convened a dedicated Task and Finish Group to work on Invasive Non-Native Species \n(INNS) \nissues in late 2012, which brings \ntogether \nconsiderable scientific, policy and practical experience of issues relating to INNS. Our objectives include scrutinising government policy, gathering evidence on the impacts of INNS on the third sector, and raising the profile of the issue with government and the public alike. Our preliminary analysis\n, developed in early 2013,\n of the fitness and success of \nT\nhe\n \nInvasive Non-native Species Framework Strategy for Great Britain\n \n(‘\nGB \nS\ntrategy\n’)\n was presented to the then Minister for Biodiversity, the Rt Hon Richard Benyon MP. We welcome the subsequent commitment from Defra to undertake not a ‘light touch’ review, but one that appears to be thorough and inclusive. \n&#xa0;1.3.\n&#xa0; \nThis submission is supported by the following \n11\n organisations:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;2.1.\n&#xa0; \nINNS cost the British economy at least £1.7billion every year, and it is estimated that in addition, \n‘\nthe total non-market costs incurred, including disturbance of ecosystem services, have been estimated to £96 billion in the UK\n’.\n \nT\nhe European Environment Agency (EEA) has estimated that the cost to the EU of a range of INNS was \nat least \n€\n12billion per year.\n All the evidence points to these costs to society increasing significantly and exponentially, as invasion increases and established INNS become more invasive (or the impacts of their invasiveness manifest themselves). The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment asserted that the global negative impacts of INNS on biodiversity were of a similar magnitude to that of climate change and habitat loss.\n  \n&#xa0;\n2.2.\n&#xa0; \nThe NGO community is deeply supportive of the clear need for EU-level action,\n without which, action at individual Member State level will always be \nsignificantly undermined. The EU \nRegulation\n \nshould\n:\n&#xa0;\n2.2.1.\n \nHave a list of species of concern that is \ninformed by the outcomes of risk assessments\n; an arbitrary limit of 50 species would completely undermine the efficacy of the Regulation. The list must also allow \nspecies to be listed on the EU-wide list which are native to parts of the EU, but have significant impacts through being invasive in other parts of the EU.\n&#xa0;\n2.2.2.\n \nE\nnhance and compl\ne\nment current and planned action in the UK\n, and allow the UK to \ngo further than \naction mandated by the Regulation\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.2.3.\n \nFacilitate\n effective and timely communications and coordination between Member States \nso that\n joint action plans \ncan\n be developed\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.2.4.\n \nF\nacilitate the development of shared risk assessment resources, \nhave \na scientific review body to provide scientific rigor to the selection of species and their risk assessments, and an underpinning database.\n&#xa0;\n2.2.5.\n \nAppropriately embed the precautionary principle and the polluter pays principle, whilst allowing some discretion in countries already heavily infested.\n&#xa0;\n2.2.6.\n \nBe\n adequately resourced. \n&#xa0;\n2.3.\n&#xa0; \nT\nhere has been significant commitment to tackling INNS in the UK, \nwhich must be supported by the development of a refreshed strategy that is\n smarter and more far reaching\n than before\n. We recommend that:\n&#xa0;\n2.3.1.\n \nThe new \nGB \nstrategy is\n:\n ambitious\n;\n adequately resourced; significantly more strategic; \nand \ncan facilitate genuine cross government action \nthat\n is developed and implemented through a close working partnership with stakeholders.\n&#xa0;\n2.3.2.\n \nA\nppropriate, effective and timely legislation is deployed at both the UK and EU level, together with an increased use of and confidence in existing tools, such as the ability to ban the sale of known problem species, and a ratification of the Ballast Water Convention. We also need to harmonise the detail of existing \nUK \nlegislation, for example \nby \ncreating provision for Species Control Orders in all UK countries, not just in Scotland.\n&#xa0;\n2.3.3.\n \nW\nell\n-\ndevised and implemented communication programs \nare put in place, and\n are adequately resourced to deliver clear results\n. These should be\n compl\ne\nmented by sector\n-\nled voluntary initiatives\n,\n which also seek to educate and build capacity within those sectors and are monitored to ensure the\ny\n deliver results. If they do not, then regulatory means \nshould be deployed.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;3.1.\n&#xa0; \nSome NGOs manage large areas of the countryside where non-native species have become established and sometimes subsequently \nbecome \ninvasive. A complete overview of costs for all members would be difficult to produce, but here are some indications: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1.\n&#xa0; \nThe \nGovernment is to be applauded for its investment in the GB Strategy. Th\ne strategy\n was developed in consultation with many stakeholders, at a time when few other EU Countries \nhad \nadopted similar programmes. The establishment of a dedicated GB Secretariat to oversee and support delivery of the strategy was also much welcomed. The GB Strategy was visionary for its time, providing much\n-\nneeded focus and prioritisation.\n&#xa0;\n4.2.\n&#xa0; \nMuch of the planned delivery against this strategy has been effective, but there have been shortfalls. Unfortunately\n,\n the shortfalls have occurred \naround\n preventative measures\n, which are the measures\n most likely to be cost effective, but \nalso \noften the most difficult to implement. For example, no Pathway Action Plans (identifying the routes of invasion and planning for their control) have been completed, and horizon scanning work (identifying future threats) has been patchy at best\n;\n both\n were\n given priority in the original strategy.\n&#xa0;\n4.3.\n&#xa0; \nIn addition, although Government consulted in 2007 on how a ban on sale (possible via Section 14ZB of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981) on certain problem species could be an effective tool for their control, a ban on sale has yet to be fully implemented and is currently only envisaged for five\n plant\n species, the majority of which are already widespread. We believe a number of other species lend themselves to a swift ban on sale, for example \nLysichiton americanus\n (American skunk cabbage). \nT\nhe proposed EU Regulation on Invasive Alien Species would likely make provision for bans on sale (a black list) for key species over and above those currently listed for such action in the UK,\n but\n it may be many years before such action becomes obligatory in the UK. There is therefore a need to explore further use of this domestic tool in the interim.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Legislative5.1.\n&#xa0; \nWe need robust and fit\n-\nfor\n-\npurpose domestic legislation which includes the effective and timely \nuse\n of existing legislation\n,\n together with its enforcement, supplemented by a number of \nchanges\n to address shortfalls. To our knowledge, there have been few\n,\n if any\n,\n prosecutions of those who intentionally allow species listed under Schedule 9 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act to become established in the wild (despite this having evidently been the case on a number of occasions). This sets an unhelpful precedent and \nprovides \nno deterrent. As mentioned above, an effective response, that fully embodies the precautionary principle, includes a swift ban on sale of those species which evidence demonstrates are having, or could have\n,\n a major impact on human health, the economy or natural assets, and for which trade and sale are the major pathways \nof\n invasion. \nW\ne do not feel that the precautionary approach is\n currently\n given sufficient weight\n \nin consideration of which species should or should not be banned from sale. In addition\n,\n the evidence presented to support such a case does not include the full range of actual or predicted costs and benefits to wider society of implementing this measure.\n&#xa0;\n5.2.\n&#xa0; \nA major barrier to the effective control of problem species lies in the inability of relevant authorities to access land where problem species have become established. Neither can they compel the landowners to notify \nthem of\n the presence of named species, or take action to address invasions where it is reasonable to do so. This situation was recently rectified within Scottish legislation with the creation of Species Control Orders under the Wildlife and Natural Environment (Scotland) Act 2011. Such land can now be accessed\n in Scotland\n, and\n costs can,\n if necessary\n, be \nrecovered from land owners who do not take action. \n&#xa0;\n5.3.\n&#xa0; \nThe Scottish model also includes a new framework that assumes species are not safe for release (but are otherwise safe for sale) unless it can be proven otherwise; this effectively amounts to a ‘white list’ approach. With so many problem species on the horizon, and a relative lack of information about the likely impact of future invaders, the Scottish framework embodies the precautionary approach (\nalthough \na variety of exemptions do apply).\n With an ineffective and incomplete Schedule 9 listing mechanism in England and Wales, which does not benefit from regular review and which is ineffectively publicised or used to prosecute, we believe there is merit in \nexploring whether\n similar measures in England and Wales in relation to the intentional release of species\n could be beneficial\n. \n&#xa0;\nPartnerships5.4.\n&#xa0; \nThe GB Strategy helped to establish a number of key partnerships, in recognition of the shared problem and joint solutions and resources required to address the impacts of INNS. The NGO community are key lead partners in virtually every Local Action Group (LAG), which coordinate action on the ground. We have also played a supporting role in promoting ‘Be Plant Wise’, in establishing and promoting ’Check Clean Dry’ and in \ncommunicating the impacts of INNS to the general public and the press. An effective response, into which partners can invest\n,\n requires absolute transparency as to the decision making \nthat \nunderpin\ns\n action, communications work, and \nthe \nprioritisation process. This has unfortunately been lacking on a number fronts thus far.\n&#xa0;\n5.5.\n&#xa0; \nWe recommend\n \nthat the NGO community be brought into high\n-\nlevel decision making with regards to government policy on INNS, ideally through representation on the \nINNS\n Programme Board. This \nwould\n facilitate greater buy-in and investment from the NGO community\n, which is necessary to successfully tackle INNS in the UK\n.\n&#xa0;\nPublic communications5.6.\n&#xa0; \nIt is widely acknowledged that to effectively tackle INNS we need \nthe \ngeneral public \nto be aware of the problem and ready to act, \nas well as \nhaving \neffective technical tools\n available\n. Many of the species we would seek to identify\n,\n contain or tackle will first be observed by members of the public, and \nthe reasons for addressing \nsome species \nwill\n require thoughtful explanation. There has been good progress\n,\n for example in developing ‘Be Plant Wise’ and ‘Check Clean Dry’, although it has proven difficult to establish the success of these projects\n,\n which are aimed at particular sectors rather than the general public. \n&#xa0;\n5.7.\n&#xa0; \nThe GB Strategy established a communications group to oversee and deliver on this need. However, although this group has made progress it has been stymied by a government freeze on funds for communications work, and an inability to gain the necessary expertise to devise structured campaigns. Moving forward, \nwe need\n a well-resourced and fit\n-\nfor\n-\npurpose communications campaign which seeks to meaningfully engage with all relevant sectors, is dynamic and can be monitored to demonstrate impact.\n&#xa0;\nIntra-departmental and intra-governmental communications5.8.\n&#xa0; \nAn effective response requires buy-in, resourcing and ownership of action in \nd\nepartments other than Defra (\nas well as\n between Defra’s \nagencies\n). This is in recognition of the breadth of impacts caused by INNS to society, and the need to draw on mechanisms outside Defra’s \nscope of \ninfluence. For example, responsibility for ratification of the Ballast Water convention lies not with Defra but with the Department for Transport.  \n&#xa0;Prioritising action5.9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt has long been recognised that to fully address the presence of problem \nspecies \n(or \nthose with the \npotential\n to cause\n problem\ns\n) already present in the UK (which currently stands at \nalmost 2000 non-native species\n)\n,\n requires resources far beyond those likely to be reasonably available. The actual or likely impact of each species varies, as does knowledge of the ecology of each species and of how it will express its invasiveness in a UK context. An element of prioritisation has been core to the domestic approach thus far, underpinned by the production of high quality risk assessments\n. However,\n we do not consider that \nthis\n has been sufficiently strategic. There has been a lack of clarity over why action for certain species has been prioritised over others, and in particular what outcome is ultimately sought for species already established. The lack of systematic horizon scanning has undermined the ability to prioritise action towards preventing new species from arriving – the most cost effective means to prevent impacts, i.e. before species become established.\n&#xa0;\n5.10.\n \nA single body to identify, plan and oversee strategic management INNS, and to ensure that the environmental benefit of available resources is maximised, should be identified. This will need to operate at country level – the legislation in Scotland has been updated recently to allow for this.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;6.1.\n&#xa0; \nThe NGO community is deeply supportive of the clear need for EU-level action, to be underpinned by appropriately robust legislation which all Member States must in principle adhere to. The effectiveness of our own GB level strategy is significantly undermined by a lack of corresponding action and investment by other Member States. We have worked, and continue to work\n,\n on a number of levels to ensure that this legislation is positioned to support the efforts of the UK through enhanced efforts and coordination in other countries that affect us, and where necessary further drive forward domestic action. The attributes of appropriate and effective EU legislation that can address INNS from our perspective are:\n&#xa0;\n6.1.1.\n \nOne whose resultant action is not arbitrarily limited to a set number of priority species\n.\n \nT\nhe list \nshould \ninstead \nbe \ninformed by the outcomes of risk assessments, and regularly updated if need be (quickly) via an emergency listing mechanism.\n If the list of species of concern was limited to 50 it would completely undermine the efficacy of the Regulation.\n&#xa0;\n6.1.2.\n \nA Regulation\n that enhances and compl\ne\nments current and planned action in the UK. For example\n,\n by ensuring that other countries where Ruddy Duck is present take the necessary measures to \ncompletely \neradicate it from both the wild and private collections (to complement the extensive efforts of the UK)\n. The Regulation must also\n not undermine the efficacy of planned and future ban\ns\n on sale in the UK, which may go further than \nmeasures demanded by the Regulation \nor \nbe applied to species not included on \nEU-wide species lists.\n&#xa0;\n6.1.3.\n \nOne which facilitates effective and timely communications and coordination between Member States so that joint action plans can be developed, and the appearance of problem species in neighbouring states is communicated in a timely way to all other Member States so that they may take \nappropriate\n action.\n&#xa0;\n6.1.4.\n \nOne which facilitates the development of shared risk assessment resources (overseen by the Commission and pan-EU if need be), \nthrough \na scientific review body \nthat would\n provide scientific rigor to the selection of species and their risk assessments, and \nwith \nan underpinning database detailing where species are found, likely to be found, and where specific measures are in place or need to be in place.\n&#xa0;\n6.1.5.\n \nOne which allows species to be listed on the EU-wide list \nthat\n are native to parts of the EU, but have significant impacts through being invasive in other parts of the EU. For example, \nDikerogammarus villosus\n (\nk\niller shrimp) and other \nP\nonto-\nC\naspian species which originate from eastern European countries have caused\n,\n and are projected to cause\n,\n problematic outbreaks in the UK and so require measures that will come under the scope of the EU Regulation.\n&#xa0;\n6.1.6.\n \nAppropriately embeds the precautionary principle and the polluter pays principle, whilst allowing some discretion in countries already heavily infested.\n&#xa0;\n6.1.7.\n \nIs adequately resourced. We are concerned that the costs of implementing the Regulation, and the servicing of the associated data needs, is seriously underestimated at this stage\n,\n and that this \nlack of funding\n may prove short sighted and cost ineffective. \n&#xa0;\n6.1.8.\n \nOne which assures (despite retaining some scope for derogations to take place) that pan\n-\nEU action can be secured where this is critical for effective outcomes. All Member States need to adopt the precautionary principle because knowledge \nof\n how species evolve, disperse and behave in different climates is far from complete. The UK must also follow suit. For example, \nEichhornia crassipes\n (\nw\nater hyacinth, which originates from South America) is not currently present in the wild in the UK, but is \nalready a serious problem in some neighbouring Member States. There is some scope for the species to be invasive in the UK in the future (under climate change scenarios), and for the UK to act as a reservoir for invasion back into neighbouring states - thus undermining their own actions. Should it be a species recommended for pan\n-\nEU measures, then the UK must follow suit.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;7.1.\n&#xa0; \nThe renewed GB Strategy must embed an effective domestic response\n,\n as detailed above. It must also by savvy in its outlook towards and embracing of the EU situation, recognising that there is a need to share our knowledge with countries that have yet to prepare\n a strategy\n. The success of many of our actions is dependent upon the cultivation of cross\n-\nborder relationships. If the draft \nGB S\ntrategy continues to \nbenefit from\n input during its development phase from a range of stakeholders, including the NGO sector, then it will gain significant endorsement and greater action as a result. Equally important\n,\n however, is the need to broker broader ownership and action across other relevant parts of government, underpinned by evidence, with the assumption that commitment and funds must follow. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;20 \nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nWilliams F., Eschen R., Harris A., Djeddour D., Pratt C., Shaw R.S., Varia S., Lamontagne-Godwin J., Thomas S.E. &amp; Murphy S.T. 2010. \nThe Economic Cost of Invasive Non-Native Species\n on Great Britain.\n \nCAB/001/09.\n \n2012. \nThe impacts of invasive alien species in Europe\n, European Environment Agency, t\nechnical report No 16/2012\n.\n \n2005. \nThe Millennium Ecosystem A\ns\nsessment.\n"
