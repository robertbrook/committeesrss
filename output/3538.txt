[[[Written evidence]]]

[[[ from the Energy and Climate Change Committee]]]

[[[ (SCE0018)]]]

[[[Background]]]The Liaison Committee’s report states that “committees should be proactive and forward looking – and devote less effort  to raking over the coals of past events unless there are lessons to be learnt and changes to be recommended” (Para 70). The Committee’s approach reflects this conclusion: where possible we seek to engage with and influence Government as it formulates its policies. The Committee has sought to maintain its effectiveness by:This memorandum sets out some of the Committee’s key achievements in the past 18 months (May 2012-November 2013), within the context of these four measures. It draws on the revised core tasks for select committees with reference to Liaison Committee recommendations on committee effectiveness.  During this period the Committee has held approximately:&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Strategy:]]]In both 2012 and 2013 the Committee has heard evidence from the Secretary of State on the subject of 

[[[Departmental Priorities.]]] The main challenge for DECC over the past 18 months has been bringing the Energy Bill before Parliament, working out the detail of its implementation, and keeping its reforms on track to deliver the infrastructure investment required to keep the lights on in future years. The Committee has been closely involved throughout the process.

[[[Policy:]]]The Committee has examined specific policy proposals as well conducting inquiries timed to coincide with Government consultations to allow the Committee to contribute and help the Department to prioritise areas of focus.  For example, the Committee has inquired into 

[[[S]]]

[[[mart meter roll-out]]]

[[[,]]] to seek to shape the way the project is implemented in 2015-20 and to help the Government avoid some of the difficulties experienced in other counties rolling out this technology.In some cases, to enable the Committee to input within relevant timeframes, the Committee has held one-off evidence sessions and then written to Ministers drawing attention to the evidence and highlighting Committee concerns (for example: 

[[[t]]]

[[[he inclusion of Aviation and Shipping Emissions in Carbon Budgets, CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme]]]). This approach, using evidence and correspondence published on the Committee website, has allowed the Committee to cover more ground, and in a timely way, maximising its influence.In other cases the Committee has timed its inquiries so as to be able to produce a report to feed into policy development.  In the Government’s response to the Committee’s recent report on 

[[[UK Oil Refining]]]

[[[ ]]] the Government stated “The Government would like to thank the Committee for conducting its inquiry into UK oil refining and for its timely report which will be taken into account as part of the Cross-Government review.”  The Government has also stated that it will draw on the Committee’s conclusions and recommendations in its report on Local Energy in the Community Energy Strategy that will be published later this year.The Committee conducted an inquiry entitled The Green Deal: watching brief which sought to help Government define what success would look like in this project by identifying performance indicators. The Committee’s report has  helped to shape the data that will be gathered during the life of the project, and the Committee has pledged to return to this topic to assess the scheme against the identified indicators, at regular intervals. 

[[[Draft Bills and delegated legislation]]]The Committee held a number of sessions following up its pre-legislative scrutiny inquiry, which helped maintain the momentum, for a Bill proper to be introduced to Parliament.  In responding to the Committee’s report, the Government made a number of amendments based on Committee recommendations (for example on CCS exemptions from the 

[[[Emissions Performance Standard]]]). A number of Committee members  served on the Public Bill Committee that conducted line by line scrutiny of the Bill and the Committee Chair tabled amendments at report stage, based on the conclusions and recommendations from the Committee’s report on the draft Bill. &#xa0;

[[[Expenditure and Performance]]]The Committee holds an annual session with both DECC and Ofgem to examine respective 

[[[Annual Reports and Accounts]]]

[[[.]]] Following the Annual Report and Accounts session with DECC in 2012 the Committee decided to hold a session specifically on the 

[[[Nuclear ]]]

[[[Decommissioning]]]

[[[ Authority]]]:  a publicly funded body which had been insufficiently scrutinised given that it remains the single largest item of expenditure within DECC’s budget (approximately 70%). We commissioned the NAO to conduct a detailed analysis which we published in October 2013, immediately before holding a session with the Chief Executive of the NDA, a representative from the Shareholder Executive the Office of Nuclear Development. In its regular examination of DECC and Ofgem’s Annual Reports and Accounts the Committee draws considerably on support from both the NAO and the House of Commons Scrutiny Unit, for which we are very grateful. 

[[[Launching inquiries]]]The Committee positively influences the delivery of Government policy when it launches inquiries. In doing so, DECC responds by trying to get its house in order before the inquiry starts.  For example, the Committee recently launched the terms of reference for an inquiry into the Government’s strategy on attracting and managing investment into low-carbon innovative industries.  These terms of reference were based on a NAO investigation commissioned by the Committee  following an earlier 2010 investigation. Since the 2010 investigation, DECC responded by devoting resources to align and improve its cross-government co-ordination to deliver better low carbon innovation, and since the new inquiry was launched has focused efforts again to improve delivery in preparation for the forthcoming inquiry.

[[[Appointments]]]The Committee has held pre-appointment hearings with the new Chair of the Committee on Climate Change, and more recently, with the new Chair of the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority. &#xa0;

[[[Outreach: ]]]

[[[ublic engagement]]]

[[[ beyond Westminster]]]As part of its inquiry into consumer engagement with energy markets, three Member led events were held in Aberdeen, Suffolk and Southampton. These involved workshops with the public to  gather evidence about public understanding of their bills and of how energy efficiency could help reduce costs. Parliamentary outreach submitted summaries of the sessions to our inquiry as formal evidence, enabling us to draw on it in our report. We also commissioned questions in an opinion poll to provide an additional layer of quantifiable evidence.In January 2013, three members of the Committee travelled to Glasgow to visit a community heating project and participate in a public debate involving Committee members and key civil society organisations. The session was transcribed and drawn upon in the Committee’s report on Energy Prices, Profits and Poverty. The feedback from the public was very positive and collaboration with the  other organisations meant that the event was also used as a way to disseminate advice about support available for those in fuel poverty, with the result that one pensioner had her central heating system replaced at no cost to her through the Energy Company Obligation programme. The Committee has found this public engagement enlightening and beneficial and now plans to take formal evidence away from Westminster as part of its current inquiry into Carbon Capture and Storage. 

[[[Enabling more stakeholders to engage directly with inquiries within Westminster]]]The Committee has been committed to engaging with the general public and other stakeholders, such as the investment community and small businesses that wouldn’t normally have direct access to senior government policy makers, and then enabling them to make contributions to inquiries; in effect, making Parliament more accessible.  This was exemplified through the recent high-profile inquiry into energy prices for consumers, through which the Committee engaged external stakeholders systematically:

[[[Stag]]]

[[[e 1: Pre-inquiry media coverage. ]]]Committee members took part in national television and radio interviews,  wrote opinion pieces in national newspapers, and encouraged all stakeholders to engage directly with the issues and the actual inquiry.

[[[-profile stakeholders to participate.  ]]]Ovo Energy’s Stephen Fitzpatrick was given equal witness status alongside the Big Six energy firms.  The media covered his oral evidence extensively and prominently in subsequent reporting. 

[[[Stage 3: Enabling members of the public to participate in real time during the inquiry.  ]]]Members of the public e-mailed the Committee with questions for witnesses during the live broadcast, and Committee members then asked relevant questions moments later.   The public responded favourably.&#xa0;

[[[Post legislative scrutiny]]]The Committee has received a post-legislative scrutiny memorandum from DECC on the Climate Change Act 2008. It has raised questions on this during oral evidence with the Committee on Climate Change. 

[[[European Scrutiny]]]In this session the Committee has provided formal opinions to the European Scrutiny Committee on the 2015 International Climate Change Agreement, the EU 2030 Framework, and the Renewable Energy Progress Report. 

[[[Support for the House]]]As well as putting forward its reports for debate in Westminster Hall, which were well attended by Committee members, the Committee’s work on the Energy Bill has supported the House’s objective of effective legislative scrutiny.ECC was one of the first Committees to launch an inquiry on the Floor of the House, announcing two follow up inquiries at the same time (20 December 2012). &#xa0;The Committee has maintained a high level of member attendance, even during exceptionally busy periods:It has worked collaboratively, drawing on the support of the Scrutiny Unit and the NAO, commissioning a number of specific prices of work from the latter (Nuclear Landscape, Low-Carbon Innovation). It has made use of a Sub Committee, enabling the Committee to cover more ground by appointing specific members to lead on an inquiry (LC Rec 30), and has commissioned opinion polling research (LC Rec 32). We strive to make our reports short and accessible although this is challenging in the face of a technically detailed subject area and the large amounts of evidence gathered (LC Rec 33).

[[[Conclusions and recommendations ]]]

[[[Conclusions]]] 

[[[1. ]]]Select committees should influence policy and have an impact on Government departments and the agencies to which their functions may be devolved. This is our first objective. The extent of this influence and impact is the primary measure of the effectiveness of select committees. (Paragraph 12) 

[[[2. ]]]While committees' primary purpose is to scrutinise Government, it is sometimes in the public interest for them to extend their scrutiny to other organisations. (Paragraph 13) 

[[[3. ]]]Scrutiny committees are not just involved in scrutinising others but have an active role to play themselves in putting issues on the agenda and acting as a forum for public debate. (Paragraph 14) 

[[[4. ]]]We believe it continues to be useful to define core tasks for committees, to guide committees in deciding their programme, but not to constrain their freedom to decide their own priorities. (Paragraph 16) 

[[[5. ]]]Activity of itself is not a measure of effectiveness, and different subject areas require different levels, and different forms, of scrutiny; but the overall high level of committee activity this Parliament is a positive indicator of the commitment made by committees to the tasks they have been set by the House of Commons. (Paragraph 21) 

[[[6. ]]]We believe that the value of these debates would be greatly enhanced if they were considered on a substantive motion. We note that this is possible under the Standing Orders — substantive motions have recently been used for debates on e-petitions in Westminster Hall — though any division would need to be taken on the floor of the House. Where the committee concerned thinks this is appropriate, and subject to the agreement of the Chairman of Ways and Means, we intend to use this approach in future. (Paragraph 48) 

[[[7. ]]]We will continue to give priority for Estimates Day debates to committee reports which focus on departmental expenditure and performance. (Paragraph 51) 

[[[8. ]]]The consensus of those who gave us evidence is that committees are successful in influencing Government. (Paragraph 61) 

[[[9. ]]]While we welcome the wide consensus that select committees have a significant, positive impact, we take very seriously the critical feedback received. (Paragraph 63) 

[[[10. ]]]Now, two years into the Parliament, is a very good time for committees to take stock and agree their objectives for the remainder of the Parliament. (Paragraph 64) 

[[[11. ]]]We agree that committees should be proactive and forward-looking — and devote less effort to raking over the coals of past events unless there are lessons to be learnt and changes to be recommended. (Paragraph 70) 

[[[12. ]]]When considering how to make an impact with the media, committees have a wider range of choices than ever before, and this means we need to give more thought to what we really want to achieve and target resources effectively. (Paragraph 85) 

[[[13. ]]]While committees need to maintain their freedom to respond to their particular circumstances, we believe there is a case for setting some principles of good practice. It is our intention to prepare a set of guidelines for this purpose. (Paragraph 104) 

[[[14. ]]]If a government response is inadequate, a committee can and should draw attention to this when it reports and publishes the response. (Paragraph 108) 

[[[15. ]]]We stand ready to work with the Cabinet Office on new guidelines for departments on producing government responses to reports. (Paragraph 109) 

[[[16. ]]]We do not accept that the Osmotherly rules should have any bearing on whom a select committee should choose to summon as a witness. The Osmotherly rules are merely internal for Government. They have never been accepted by Parliament. Where the inquiry relates to departmental delivery rather than ministerial decision-making, it is vital that committees should be able to question the responsible official directly — even if they have moved on to another job. It does of course remain the case that an official can decline to answer for matters of policy, on the basis that it is for the minister to answer for the policy, but officials owe a direct obligation to Parliament to report on matters of fact and implementation. This does not alter the doctrine of ministerial accountability in any way. Ministers should never require an official to withhold information from a select committee. It cannot be a breach of the principle of ministerial responsibility for an official to give a truthful answer to a select committee question. No official should seek to protect his or her minister by refusing to do so. (Paragraph 113) 

[[[17. ]]]The way ministerial accountability operates has on occasion been unacceptable, with ministers blaming officials for failures in their departments or in agencies for which they are responsible, but also with officials then refusing to answer questions which would indicate where responsibility for failure actually lies. (Paragraph 114) 

[[[18. ]]]Additional work arising from such additional committees as the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards could have the effect of reducing availability for existing committees. We do not regard this as acceptable. Any substantial extra committee work, beyond the normal work of existing committees including joint committees, which is undertaken at the initiative of Government should be fully funded by a transfer from the Treasury to the House of Commons. (Paragraph 121) 

[[[19. ]]]Now may not be the best time to argue for increased resources, but it should be the long term goal of the House to build up the capacity of select committees, to improve their effectiveness and status, to increase their powers and influence, and to improve their efficiency by providing chairs and staffs with accommodation and infrastructure to enable them to hold Government to account. (Paragraph 128) 

[[[20. ]]]We are persuaded that the disadvantages of enshrining parliamentary privilege in statute would outweigh the benefits. (Paragraph 133) 

[[[21. ]]]We conclude that, at the very least Parliament should set out a clear, and realistic, statement of its powers — and perhaps also its responsibilities — in a resolution of the House and set out in more detail in Standing Orders how those powers are to be exercised. (Paragraph 134) 

[[[Recommendations]]] 

[[[For Committees]]] 

[[[22. ]]]Our Committee has asked the Procedure Committee to consider whether members wishing to leave a committee could be counted as discharged, even if it means that the lack of an applicant leaves a vacancy on the committee. We reiterate the concern we expressed in the last Parliament about the size of select committees and support the Wright Committee's recommendation that the size of departmental committees should not normally be more than 11 members. (Paragraph 29) 

[[[23. ]]]We encourage other committees to make use of the support of the Scrutiny Unit and to discuss with the National Audit Office how its programme of work might help support the work of the committee. (Paragraph 42) 

[[[24. ]]]As a model of "best practice", we recommend that committees: 

[[[25. ]]]We expect Government departments to be transparent about their objectives, and we ought to practise what we preach. We commend to other committees the practice of publishing strategic objectives, and of consulting their department and other stakeholders on them. (Paragraph 66) 

[[[26. ]]]We recommend that, before they launch an inquiry, committees agree a comprehensive minute setting out what they hope to achieve, and the likelihood of success. (Paragraph 69) 

[[[27. ]]]We recommend that in future inquiries, as a matter of routine, committees include consideration of the financial aspects and implications of the policies being examined. This could include for instance, what the justification for spending public money is, what evidence there is that it will offer, or is offering, good value for money to the taxpayer, what alternatives have been considered and whether they would be likely to be more effective, and the outcomes expected to be added to or improved upon by the spending. (Paragraph 72) 

[[[28. ]]]We encourage committees to hold evidence sessions at least annually with ministers and departmental accounting officers, and include within these sessions consideration of how departments evaluate and take decisions on spending, and how they assess the effectiveness of the spending they undertake. (Paragraph 73) 

[[[29. ]]]We encourage committees to review departments' Mid-Year Reports when published, using them to identify relevant issues and questions relating to finance and performance. (Paragraph 74) 

[[[30. ]]]We recommend that committees experiment with different approaches, such as appointing a rapporteur to lead on a particular inquiry, or choosing "lead questioners" for an evidence session. (Paragraph 76) 

[[[31. ]]]We recommend that committees make every effort to broaden their range of witnesses, and to take into account the principles of diversity and inclusion in planning their inquiries and committee programme. (Paragraph 77) 

[[[32. ]]]Committees should bear in mind the option of commissioning research when planning their long-term strategies, and, if necessary, the House authorities should increase the money available for this purpose. (Paragraph 78) 

[[[33. ]]]We encourage committees to keep their reports short and accessible, and to avoid too many recommendations. A clear indication of which recommendations are most important will help the committee achieve impact and make follow-up easier. We recommend that the usual template for committee reports be changed to distinguish clearly the recommendations targeted at the Government. We suggest that conclusions should be in bold, with recommendations in bold italics, and that it should be clearly stated to whom the recommendation is addressed. (Paragraph 79) 

[[[34. ]]]We recommend that each committee should appoint a member of staff, or an adviser, or an outside body, who will monitor follow-up to recommendations in respect of each report. The committee should report to the House at least once in each parliamentary Session upon how many of its recommendations the Government has acted, and what follow-up is proposed on outstanding recommendations. (Paragraph 83) 

[[[35. ]]]It is sensible for departmental select committees to be able to cross departmental boundaries when this is in the interest of effective scrutiny of matters which go beyond a single department, but they should do so in ways which respect the role of other departmental select committees and in full consultation with the chairs of those committees. (Paragraph 84) 

[[[36. ]]]We recommend that the introductory briefings offered to new committee members be given more formality, and include a meeting with the chair or another experienced committee member. When there is significant turnover following a reshuffle, for example, a programme of collective briefings for new committee members should be arranged. (Paragraph 96) 

[[[37. ]]]We recommend that committees consider the benefits of using professional trainers to help them refresh and develop their questioning skills. (Paragraph 97) 

[[[38. ]]]We recommend that chairs discuss with their committee how they see their role, and seek their endorsement for it. At this stage in the Parliament, there may be benefit in chairs asking their committees for individual feedback on their chairmanship, as an aid to the chair's professional development and to encourage committee engagement. (Paragraph 100) 

[[[For the House]]] 

[[[39. ]]]The timing rule should be relaxed to provide that a statement on a select committee report should be within a reasonable period of the publication of the report: say, within 10 sitting days (so that reports launched when the House is not sitting are not precluded). Finally, we recommend that it should be for the Speaker, in consultation with the Chair of the Liaison Committee, to decide whether a select committee report is sufficiently topical and significant to merit a statement on the floor of the House on any sitting day. It would remain the responsibility of the Backbench Business Committee to decide what select committee reports merit debate in backbench time. (Paragraph 50) 

[[[40. ]]]We recommend that the funding of the Committee Office Media and Communications team be increased to allow the employment of one or two additional media officers. (Paragraph 120) 

[[[41. ]]]We recommend that committee clerks, and in some cases other key staff, should normally remain in post for at least four years. (Paragraph 122) 

[[[42. ]]]We recommend that, if a committee wishes this and the Liaison Committee agrees, it should be possible to recruit a committee clerk directly to post by open competition, and that there should be greater flexibility in bringing in outside experts to support committees in their work. (Paragraph 125) 

[[[For Government]]] 

[[[43. ]]]We recommend that the Government engage with us in a review of the relationship between Government and select committees with the aim of producing joint guidelines for departments and committees, which recognise ministerial accountability, the proper role of the Civil Service and the legitimate wish of Parliament for more effective accountability. (Paragraph 115) 

[[[For others]]] 

[[[44. ]]]Now that select committees are elected by the House and taking a higher profile, we urge editors and broadcasters to introduce reports of parliamentary committees in such a way as to indicate their official status, with words such as "the House of Commons Education Committee" or "the Parliamentary Education Committee", rather than somewhat absurdly saying a report has been produced by "a group of MPs" (which the broadcasters seem to use regularly) suggesting that such a group is self-selecting at random and has no official status (rather like referring to the BBC as "a group of broadcasters").
