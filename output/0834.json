"Written evidence from Action on Hearing Loss (LTC 83)&#xa0;About usAction on Hearing Loss is the new name for RNID. We're the charity working for a world where hearing loss doesn't limit or label people, where tinnitus is silenced – and where people value and look after their hearing. \n&#xa0;\nOur response focuses on key issues that relate to people with hearing loss. Throughout this response we use the term 'people with hearing loss' to refer to people with all levels of hearing loss and tinnitus, including people who are profoundly deaf. We are happy for the details of this response to be made public.\n&#xa0;IntroductionAction on Hearing Loss welcomes the opportunity to provide written evidence on the management of long-term conditions within the NHS and social care system. Hearing loss is a long term condition affecting over 10 million people in the UK – one\n in six of the population\n. \nO\nur recently released evidence-based report\n \nJoining up\n \nshowed how\n large cost savings and improvements to quality of life could be achieved from better provision of health and social care services to people who have hearing loss and also have other long-term conditions.\n&#xa0;\nSummary&#xa0;Hearing loss and other long-term conditions in an ageing population3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUnmet communication needs, arising from unmanaged hearing loss, pose a challenge to provision of care and hence the wider management of other long term conditions.\n \n3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPeople with hearing loss experience greater difficulties in accessing health\n and social care\n services and\n public health information, and\n receive a lower standard of health service across the board.\n \n3.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUnmanaged hearing loss can bring about challenges in terms of the management of particular conditions such as diabetes, where patients can play a large role in self-managing their condition, \nso\n effective communication with health professionals \nis\n essential.\n3.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nParticular psychological and behavioural challenges can result where people have unmanaged hearing loss alongside other conditions that c\nan cause additional \ncommunication difficulties such as stroke, dementia, sight loss or Parkinson’s.\nImproving the management of multiple conditionsDesigning integrated services for people with long-term conditions13.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGPs and all health professionals should be aware of the high prevalence of hearing loss and links between hearing loss and other long-term conditions. They should enquire about whether the person has a hearing loss, \ncross-refer \nand cooperate with other professionals.\n13.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nO\npportunistic and targeted hearing checks \nshould be integrated \ninto other services and settings, such as in pharmacies, care homes, consultations for other conditions, and alongside other health checks at GPs.\n An adult hearing screening programme for 65 year olds would\n \nensure people manage their hearing loss when they are most able to adapt.\n13.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA\nll health \nand care \nproviders should ensure \nthat \nstaff are trained in deaf awareness\n and communication tactics, that proper processes are in place for booking communication support, \nthat assistive technologies are used \nand that services are accessible\n to people with hearing loss and deafness\n.\n13.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI\nnformation\n, guidance\n and \nhealth promotion campaigns \naround other long-term conditions \nshould be \nprovided for \npeople with hearing loss and deaf people who use British Sign Language (BSL)\n in a format that they can access\n.\n13.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nD\nevelop better diagnostic tools, specialist services and guidance to support people with hearing loss who also have other long term conditions, and make sure these are used. \nFor example, \naudiological\n assessments for people with dementia have been developed which simplify instructions\n, and some audiology departments have adapted their testing procedures so that they meet the needs of people with dementia. \n13.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnsure that resources are allocated in a cost effective way by properly managing hearing loss in people with other long term conditions. For example, the lack of resource allocated to hearing loss within the National Dementia Strategy for England should be reviewed.\nMay 2013\n Action on Hearing Loss, \nHearing Matters\n 2011\n Action on Hearing Loss, \nJoining up\n: \nWhy people with hearing loss or deafness would benefit from an integrated response to long-term conditions\n 2013\n, www.actiononhearingloss.org.uk/joiningup\n http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=412\n http://www.diabetes.org.uk/Documents/Reports/Diabetes-in-the-UK-2012.pdf\n Action on Hearing Loss, \nHearing Matters\n 2011\n Action on Hearing Loss, \nHearing Matters\n 2011\n Action on Hearing Loss, \nHearing Matters\n 2011\n Action on Hearing Loss, \nJoining up\n 2013\n Lin F.R. et al., ‘Hearing loss and cognitive decline in older adults’ \nInternal Medicine\n 2013, 173(4):\n293-299\n \nBoxtel\n van, M.P.J. et al., ‘Mild hearing impairment can reduce verbal memory performance in a healthy adult population’ \nJournal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology\n 2000, 22(1): 147-154\n \nGates G.A. et al., ‘Central Auditory Dysfunction May Precede the Onset of Clinical Dementia in People with Probable Alzheimer's Disease’ \nJournal of the American Geriatrics Society\n 2002, 50(3): 482-488\n Lin F.R., ‘Hearing Loss and Cognition Among Older Adults in the United States’ \nThe Journals of Gerontology\n \n2011, 66(10): 1131-6\n Lin F.R. et al., ‘Hearing Loss and Incident Dementia’ \nArchives of Neurology\n 2011, 68(2): 214-220\n \nFratiglioni\n L. et al., ‘Influence of social network on occurrence of dementia: a community-based longitudinal study’ \nThe Lancet\n 2000, 355(9212): 1315-1319\n Lin F.R., ‘Hearing Loss and Cognition Among Older Adults in the United States’ \nThe Journals of Gerontology\n \n2011, 66(10): 1131-6\n \nVerghese\n J. et al., ‘Leisure Activities and the Risk of Dementia in the Elderly’ \nNew England Journal of Medicine\n 2003, 348(25): 2508-2516\n \nBoxtel\n van, M.P.J. et al., ‘Mild hearing impairment can reduce verbal memory performance in a healthy adult population’ \nJournal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology\n 2000, 22(1): 147-154\n \nBurkhalter\n C.L. et al., ‘Examining the effectiveness of traditional \naudiological\n assessments for nursing home residents with dementia-related \nbehaviors’\n \nJournal of American Academic Audiology\n 2009, 20(9): 529-38\n http://www.alz.co.uk/info/diagnosis\n \nBurkhalter\n C.L. et al., ‘Examining the effectiveness of traditional \naudiological\n assessments for nursing home residents with dementia-related \nbehaviors’\n \nJournal of American Academic Audiology\n 2009, 20(9): 529-38\n Action on Hearing Loss, \nJoining up\n 2013\n \nRosenhall\n U. and \nSundh\n V., ‘Age-related hearing loss and blood pressure’ \nNoise Health\n 2006, 8(31): 88-94\n \nMargellos-Anast\n H., \nEstarziau\n M. and Kaufman G. ‘Cardiovascular disease knowledge among culturally Deaf patients in Chicago’ \nPreventative Medicine\n 2006, 42(3): 235-9\n McKee M.M. et al., ‘Impact of communication on preventive services among deaf American Sign Language users’ \nAmerican Journal of Preventive Medicine\n 2001, 41(1): 75-79\n McKee M. et al., ‘Perceptions of cardiovascular health in an underserved community of deaf adults using American Sign Language’ \nDisability and Health \n2011, 4(3): 192–197\n Action on Hearing Loss, \nJoining up\n 2013\n \nBrentari\n D. and \nPoizner\n H., ‘A Phonological Analysis of a Deaf \nParkinsonian\n Signer’ \nLanguage &amp;
