defaultQ148 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Good morning. This is the third session of the Committee’s inquiry into Women and Sport. I would like to welcome our first panel, Kelly Simmons, the Director of the National Game and Women’s Football, Football Association, Helen Clayton, former Captain of the England Rugby Team, Alastair Marks, Head of Rugby Growth for the RFU and Nicky 
defaultPonsford
default, the Head of Performance, Women, Rugby Football Union.
default              
defaultI will start by asking you to give us a general summary of the present state. What percentage of players at grassroots are women in each of your sports, how has that changed and what progress are you making in promoting women’s sport?
defaultAlastair Marksdefault: My name is Alastair Marks. I am the Head of Rugby Growth at the RFU and my colleague, Nicky 
defaultPonsford
default, looks after the elite side of the game. We come from a background of significant progress in this area, albeit starting from a very low base, so we thank you very much for the opportunity to come in to talk to you today.
default              
defaultFollowing the integration of the Women’s Rugby Football Union last year we now have significant resources in place to support participation at all levels of the game. Women’s rugby has seen a steady but rapid increase by around 90% in grassroots participation in the past decade. We look to increase that by an additional two-thirds within the next four years, taking us to around 25,000 players in the overall game. This represents about 7% to 8% of the total rugby-playing population. There is still a way to go in doing that but we now have a strategy in place to focus all of our efforts on driving participation in over 200 focus groups and focus clubs. We have also increased our investment in the elite women’s game by over 25% to, now, £2.5 million in the last year. We are driving considerable cultural change in terms of our leadership, opportunities and position, focusing on creating a pipeline for leadership opportunity in the women’s sport, and in our management board we now have four out of our nine members who are female, with considerable work to do in some of the other areas of the game.
defaultKelly Simmonsdefault: A similar type of story: we have seen significant growth in the women’s and girls’ game, particularly since it was integrated into the FA 20 years ago. It is now the third largest sport, after men’s football and men’s cricket. Originally in the first count there were 80 teams. There are now 5,000 teams playing in our affiliated league structures and over 1 million women and girls play some form of football in terms of market share, male to female. Around 5% of adult players are women and around 11% are girls, so obviously still more to do. There is about half a million of latent demand of women and girls who want to play and we work really hard through Game Changer and the National Game Strategy—which I am sure we will come on to—to get more women and girls playing the game, so some positive developments.
defaultHelen Claytondefault: Our grassroots programme works with mainly primary schools and 40% of those participants are young girls and women. Across both our campaigns we have a play strategy that is around participation, and we have a breakthrough strategy that is around sport for development. We look at the issues not just around sport participation, but sport as a vehicle to encourage young girls around health education and social inclusion. Our programmes around social inclusion have 35% of girls and women participating.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ149 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Thank you. I think I am the only member of the Committee who was around when we examined women’s football a few years ago. When we did I remember we received some quite powerful evidence from one young girl in particular who was extremely keen but who, on reaching the age of 14, was unable to continue because she was not allowed to play with boys any longer and there was no girls’ team locally. We took evidence from quite a number of people at that time who said this was an arbitrary cut-off that was unnecessary and that it would be much better to allow coaches to decide whether or not there was a risk. The FA promised to go away and look at that, but nothing ever changed. Do you see that as an impediment or something that should be changed?
defaultKelly Simmonsdefault: It was under-11. Our mixed football was under-11. It is currently at under-15 and we have been reviewing it year-on-year in conjunction with a research team at Brunel, so each year we are allowing an additional age group to come through to play mixed football and then reviewing that in terms of whether it is at the level where the physical differences are such that it would not be deemed safe to play. We have talked consistently to UEFA and 
defaultFIFA, and there is no consistency across 
defaultEurope
default, or across the world, in terms of an agreement around that level, but the majority are around 15 to 16—some are 18.
default              
defaultThis year we have been researching under-15 with a view that—providing it is deemed safe and that environmental and physical differences aren’t such—then we would look to move it to under-16 until we get to a point where, through what we believe will be a robust search, we get to the level that we think is appropriate.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ150 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Excellent. Out of interest, what is the position in rugby? Do you have an age at which girls cannot play with boys?
defaultNicky defaultPonsforddefault: Yes, at the moment it is under-12s—again, for potential physical differences—but one of the things that we have tried to make sure happens is that girls have the opportunity to play, so from under 11 they can play in girls’ teams. We have spent a huge amount of time developing the under-13 age group, to ensure that there is a continuous pathway from under-7s, under-8s, through to adult rugby.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ151 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Sutcliffe:default We have had difficulties with the parliamentary football team in terms of female MPs wanting to play for the parliamentary team and that not being allowed, when it is not the highest of standards. It is not an issue around the quality of the players, it is around raising funds for charity. So why is it inappropriate for a female MP to play for the parliamentary football team?
defaultKelly Simmonsdefault: That is a good point, about at what level, in terms of recreational football, we could potentially open it up. There is mixed football in the university sector, where it does not come under our affiliated competitive football rules and regulations. It is a fair point, but we will continue the research to follow through what age group in terms of our competitive football, because that is predominantly what we are talking about—
default[
defaultInterruption.
default]
default We do have a lot of recreational provision outside of the competition pathway—just play centres, for example, where men and women come along together and play informal, small-sided games—but at the moment our competition pathway is up to under-15 and being researched year-on-year.
defaultMr Sutcliffe:default I am not just focusing on the parliamentary team but there is a five-a-side kick-about on a Tuesday morning that women can play and it is not a problem, but when we have the representative games we are not allowed to do that, and it does cause some embarrassment, I have to say. I am not looking at Tracey in particular, but there are issues around that. I think it might prevent the game growing and developing in terms of some of the cultural things that happen with events like that. I understand the need for change at the competitive level, but I think for informal games and recreational things it is a rule that might be relaxed. I hope you take that away.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ152 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default I want to follow one point up, because while I understand the need in both football and rugby perhaps to protect teenage children where there is a marked physical difference—and, indeed, where they are perhaps not professional or trained and coached enough to be able to recognise when something is going to be a good or a bad tackle—surely there is a point in adult competitiveness where you would get some of the elite players, both in rugby and football, who could play a perfectly reasonable level of the game for the men’s game. We have seen it in cricket where 
defaultSussex
default had a female wicket-keeper for their second team. Surely that can be transferred into football or rugby?
defaultHelen Claytondefault: Can I use a personal example for that? When we were doing some of our 
defaultEngland
default training, we trained against one of the 
defaultLoughborough
default 
defaultUniversity
default teams and I think the difference in physical condition needs to be recognised in rugby. If that had been an everyday women’s social team, or just a normal league team, there would have been quite substantial injuries. With rugby, it definitely needs to be managed really carefully, because the risk of injury—and at times serious injury—is greater. Where there is that understanding between what your team and the opposition about what they are physically capable of, and there is an understanding that perhaps they go three-quarters tilt and we go full tilt, that is recognisable. The different formats of the game allow interaction, particularly around touch and tag, so there is a high proliferation of touch and tag leagues at the moment. Some are single-sex leagues, but the majority are mixed leagues, because there is a social element as well. Where there is no contact involved with rugby, that is a real benefit to skill level and speed and to the enjoyment of both men and women playing.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ153 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default What about football? We saw a Mexican player who tried for selection for—I think it was—a 
defaultSerie
default B club, and it was ruled that she was unable to play by UEFA. Surely it should be down to the managers and the coaching team as to whether or not they think a female football player should be suitable for their team?
defaultKelly Simmonsdefault: We concentrated on developing the women’s game in its own right from the England women’s team, the Super League, all the way through the pathway and so you have the men’s and women’s game, and then mixed, in terms of the youth age. There are three areas. You have the general competitive football, which we talked about, trying to find that level in terms of safety—when is there a physical difference? Is it the point at which safety could be impacted? Then you have the young elite players, where, through the new Elite Unit that has been established and the new performance plan for women’s football, we have looked very closely at whether we put our talented young players to play against boys, to make sure that they are really challenged. That would be in a controlled environment, where you are matching like-for-like with high level coaches who are experienced in delivering in those types of environments.
defaultThen you have your more recreational, where you can see whether you need to impose the same rules for recreational fun football, which is a valid point that we need to look at. You have three different areas of the game, but in terms of a woman wanting to have a chance to play high up in the men’s game, our job is to develop the men’s and women’s games as games in their own right, because ultimately FIFA Women’s World Cup is for women, UEFA European Championships is for women, and so on. Our focus is very much around developing our pathway for women.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ154 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default Are you saying that if 
defaultRonaldo
default was a woman with the same skills as 
defaultRonaldo
default, he would not be able to play anything other than women’s football?
defaultKelly Simmonsdefault: We would not let 
defaultRonaldo
default play in the Women’s Super League to help a team win a league, so the rules work both ways really, I think.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ155 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default They have reached the top of their game in the women’s game, but you do not see any opportunity to cross over?
defaultKelly Simmonsdefault: No, I do not think so. It is no different from men’s and women’s tennis, the men’s 
default100 metres
default or the women’s 
default100 metres
default. You are developing your sports in your own 
defaultright, and therefore we want to develop the best female players to come through to the top in the women’s game at world, European and domestic level—and ditto on the men’s side. That is the way that our world governing body and European governing bodies are structured.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ156 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Sutcliffe:default Why do we have women referees in the men’s games?
defaultKelly Simmonsdefault: A good question. I think there would be female and male coaches across both games, as well as referees. At the moment, we have structured the game right across the world to the men’s game and the women’s game at the league level.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ157 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Sutcliffe:default The point I am trying to get to is that it is 
defaultaspirational
default, in the sense of: “We want to be as good as anybody else and therefore able to compete,” but because of a physical condition—well, perhaps there is a physical condition. 
defaultNicky defaultPonsforddefault: I would like to pick up on rugby perspective on the male-female aspect. On Mr Sutcliffe’s point about male and female referees and coaches, we would like to see across the board the best coaches for the best teams and the best referees for the best games. In terms of rugby, which is a full-contact game, the difference in physicality is quite marked, particularly as you go up the levels, so the opportunity for women to play in a male game is very limited. If we had a six-foot-eight-inch, 100-kilogram player, we would be delighted in our team, but that is very unlikely and we are not going to see females coming through of that ilk who are able to compete effectively in the men’s game. To back up Kelly’s point, we are very much developing—certainly the elite women’s game—for female players, because that is the route for them to take, because they are not in the position to compete in that elite men’s game.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ158 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default There do seem to be a number of studies that demonstrate that women and girls prefer non-competitive sports. We would all agree that exercise, however it is taken, is a good thing, but it would seem that a very large number of women and girls prefer non-competitive sports. You all represent competitive sports, but would you agree that perhaps we need to look at doing more—because we just think exercise is a good thing—to encourage that, if we have to through subsidising things like gym membership or indeed swimming lessons? Would that be a more effective way of getting more women and girls to at least take exercise in the non-competitive sports that they clearly prefer?
defaultAlastair Marksdefault: The key approach that we take in rugby is to make sure that we are giving as much choice and availability as possible throughout the different formats of the game. Within the women’s strategy that we have just launched, we are very much focusing on the variety of options. That might take some form of rugby fitness that gives an introduction to using a rugby ball as part of general fitness, which is all non-competitive. Our touch programme, which was launched earlier this year, has very much focused on “pitch up and play” and casual informal play that is about fitness and social mixing as much as it is about competition, although there are competition versions of that. Then we obviously have the contact forms of the game that cater for the more competitive female.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ159 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default Is there good take-up on that?
defaultAlastair Marksdefault: So far in touch, since we launched earlier this year. we now have 4,500 players on our register. We have around 19% now since the report was written who are female. We would like that to be closer to 40% as we move forward.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ160 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default But it is going up?
defaultAlastair Marksdefault: It is absolutely going up, and certainly we will focus a lot more on bringing females into touch rugby in the course of the next year. We have just launched a couple of trials around our rugby fitness programme as well, in a couple of the key women’s clubs in and around the south-west, so we are starting to see a variation and progression into the more non-competitive sides of the game—as much to introduce the game of rugby to women and make it an option in a number of cases.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ161 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default The end goal is to get them playing a competitive sport. Does that put them off at all?
defaultAlastair Marksdefault: Not necessarily. I think our view is, moving forward, that we want to create the kind of environment at our rugby clubs where all of those options are available and may be played at any given time during the week and the weekend. We accept that there will be some non-competitive forms of that and there will be some competitive forms of the game. 
defaultRugby
default clubs need to move culturally, particularly to welcome more women and girls, and we have to change the culture and variety of what we are offering, which is part of the plan.
defaultKelly Simmonsdefault: It is a similar picture with football. One of the good things about partnership with Sport England and national governing bodies is that it has shifted governing bodies away from just focusing on what would be our traditional club-based competitive sport and understanding what customers want and young people want, in terms of playing sport. For many, that is the competitive pathway that we provide. That is why I think our sports are all growing for women and girls to provide more opportunities. If we want to make sure that we get as many people into our sport as possible, then we have to provide more flexible and recreational offers. We have examples of programmes whereby a goal might be to then feed those through. If they want to play club sport—but also if they want to stay and just use play centres or our after-school clubs and play more flexible recreational football—then great. At the end of the day, we all have goals to grow participation, not just our club-based team sports.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ162 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default Is it a fundamental problem that we find that women and girls just do not take in the same way to competitive sports, and is that always going to be a problem for you?
defaultKelly Simmonsdefault: I think there are two types of girls who will play football. You have those who are committed and who perhaps are on the performance pathway and want to play a similar format of football that they see in the Premier League or the Women’s Super League—the nine-months-a-season, traditional, single-sided or 11-a-side game—and then you have girls who want to consume football, but want to play other sports or do other things, and who will want a much more flexible offer, where they can dip in and out. As a governing body, we have to provide for both, which is what we are doing in conjunction with Sport England.
defaultHelen Claytondefault: We found the same at our premiership clubs. If you create an environment where the girls feel safe and secure and you give them other options around fitness, or touch or tag, you build confidence. A lot of the time, with the young girls that we deal with on our 
defaultHitz
default programme, building that confidence, they realise they are quite competitive, because they have the skills and they are now able to think, “I can have a go at that”. So they are much 
defaultmore willing and sometimes they shock themselves with how competitive they can be, once they have the skills and the confidence. They are much more confident in their body image and self-esteem, and like to express themselves by moving from touch into 7s and 10s, and trying different formats of the game to see which one suits them better.
defaultNicky defaultPonsforddefault: One of the fundamental factors is that a lot of women like being involved in a team type environment—so, take away the competitive element, but it is a team type environment, and that is what these sports offer. We see it both through football and rugby and with other sports, such as netball, where you are seeing a lot of people coming back into the game. Team sport is really important and it is the type of offer that we can give, being part of a team, rather than necessarily just being in a competitive environment.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ163 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default Which groups of women concern you most in terms of non-participation?
defaultAlastair Marksdefault: From a rugby perspective, we are starting at a relatively low base, and one of our key strategic aims is rugby for everyone. Therefore, through the different formats of the game, we are trying to make it as inclusive as we possibly can. We do not really see any particular part of the female audience being an issue. The key challenge for us is breaking down some of the perceived barriers to the game, which may be within the individuals themselves or their environment, and making rugby an option—making it more visible, continuing on the path of making it a visible sport, making it an option as a fitness sport and making it available as a sport. We do not have a particular group that we are concerned about at this stage.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ164 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default Do you find that a sport promotion message can help to generate more interest
defaultAlastair Marksdefault: Very much so. We have just launched our All Schools programme, which aims to get 750 state schools playing rugby by 2019.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ165 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default Are you targeting any particular group with that message?
defaultAlastair Marksdefault: We are targeting what would be non-traditional rugby-playing schools. They are quite often either in more rural areas or inner-city areas, but we are not particularly focused on the inner-city audience. We are delighted to say so far 50% of those schools that have come on board—and we have 200 now—are taking on a female option as part of their programme. Making it available to all is absolutely fundamental to our sport moving forwards.
defaultKelly Simmonsdefault: Our concern area has been around drop-off at about 14 years of age. A couple of weeks ago we launched a new partnership with the Premier League and the Football League, working with over 80 of their clubs and using the power of their brands and their community trust work force to develop sessions based on the feedback from the Women’s Sport and Fitness Foundation, who we work with, around understanding why girls drop off and what they would want those sessions to look like—so, very much about fun and engaging in good quality coaching and fun games, to make sure that we address that drop-off.
default              
defaultThe other area we are looking at is Asian girls, working with the Muslim Women’s Foundation, who have been up in front of you already. Later this week we are announcing a 
defaultgrant aid scheme specifically targeting work in that area as well, in partnership with them. They are probably the two key areas that we are focusing on.
defaultHelen Claytondefault: We try to do that: we try to use our brand of the club being a community hub to attract girls, particularly with our Sport for Development programmes, engaging them, using rugby as the hook. That is the advert, if you like—“Come and play rugby”—but it revolves around different sports and activities that engage them in the club and the team sport environment, building all those personal attributes that will then lead them into the rugby-playing environment, where, once confidence has been built, we can then hand them to those local clubs, where they will hopefully continue playing and develop the competitive edge.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ166 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default Isn’t one of the problems that research would suggest that a lot of women are put off sport early on at school by the way that sport and PE is taught at school? Would you concur with that?
defaultHelen Claytondefault: One of our grassroots focus is through the Aviva Schools programme. We have trained 1,200 primary school teachers, who stereotypically and traditionally do not like to deliver PE—they are not given a lot of training on how to deliver it, and rugby is obviously a tiny part of that. We go into those schools, and as part of the programme they get trained. There are resources left in the schools, and they see the passion and commitment that our coaches have, and hopefully that will reflect on those young girls in the school, which will then set them up for life as PE participants.
defaultAlastair Marksdefault: We very much focus on that within the RFU as well, primarily at the secondary school age group, but educating the teachers, helping them understand and break down the perceptions of what can on the surface seem like a complex game. It is absolutely fundamental, so we dedicate an awful lot of education time into equipping them with the right skills to then teach their pupils.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ167 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default I certainly remember myself at school that there was this perception that there are those who are good at sport, when they are at school, and they are singled out and everything seems to revolve around them, and if you are not naturally very good at sport, you tend to find it is a little bit irrelevant. Would you agree that there is a problem that there is this perception that, frankly, sport is only for those who are really good at it and others do not even bother to try?
defaultKelly Simmonsdefault: I think physical literacy levels of young children leaving primary school is a really key area. I have worked in the industry for 20 years and we have been grappling with this. Unless we have PE specialists, it is always going to be a struggle. When you look at the amount of hours that teachers get in training on PE, I think it is about eight hours to then go away and deliver PE, so you can understand the challenges that teachers face. As a national governing body, we have rolled out our skills programme very much around physical literacy and skills. We have skills coaches in every 
defaultcounty
default 
defaultFA
default. We have offered up to about 5 million places—43% of those are girls on our skills programme—and free resources that are 
defaultafPE
default-accredited, so we are very much working in partnership to make sure they are not about football, but about physical education and football.
defaultWe have just put in place a new unit at 
defaultSt George’s
default 
defaultPark
default, which will be providing free training for teachers, teachers in training and coaches working in schools to support coaches, working in the curricula alongside teachers. It is absolutely fundamental. Potentially the one gap with 
defaultthe Government sports strategy is that the focus is on 14-plus through the whole sport plan, but if we do not get it right in primary schools, we have a really hard battle all the way through.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ168 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default It is part of being a good teacher to dispel that notion that unless you are naturally very good at sport there is no point in trying.
defaultHelen Claytondefault: That is key. Your first coach or your first teacher, in whatever subject, has a massive impact on how you view that subject or area. Your coaches or your teachers need to be passionate and literate in their sport and physical activity to pass that on to whoever they happen to be delivering to, to encourage those that are not physically able yet, and that needs to be passed on and recognised, for teachers to identify the skills that are missing around physical literacy.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ169 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default So there is much work that we need to do on that?
defaultHelen Claytondefault: Yes, and at a younger level. It is the primary level where you are developing those skills, and for us, if you cannot catch a ball, you cannot play rugby. You need to have those base skills around balance, co-ordination and agility, and a love of sport and running around. That is key.
defaultAlastair Marksdefault: Where rugby has quite a distinct advantage is that it can absolutely be for everyone in all shapes and sizes, both male and female. I do not think it is a game that distinguishes particularly between different shapes of people. Where we absolutely believe rugby needs to be is in the secondary school system, certainly from key stages 3 and 4 onwards. Like the FA, we absolutely believe that children need to be physically literate and they need to be athletic—not necessarily athletes—at an early age.
defaultWe like to believe—and we have certainly seen from our evidence—that by introducing rugby at the secondary school age level, it is more likely to keep them in the game throughout their teen years and into adult players, and that is certainly where we want to move the game as we move forward, both in terms of keeping people in as players, but also then as volunteers and coaches, as they move through their rugby careers.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ170 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default What more can sport do with role models for women to try to elevate in people’s minds that this is something that they can perhaps achieve? Who are the great role models in your view at the moment for women in sport?
defaultHelen Claytondefault: At a grassroots level, it is the first person you come into contact with, so it is the person you go into schools with. You need your role models in terms of who you see in the media, but in terms of a young girl in primary or secondary school, it is that PE teacher, that coach or whoever comes in and passes on that passion around the sport or the activity or just the joy of being physically active. They are the best role models, and 25% of our coaches and volunteers at premiership rugby are women, and they are keen on getting young girls active in sport.
defaultKelly Simmonsdefault: Helen is right. Role models go all the way through the game. In terms of the top end, one of the initiatives that we have done with the Women’s Super League is to buy out the time of an ambassador in each club—what we call a digital ambassador, because we 
defaultare really focused on using social media to try to promote the WSL, the clubs coming into the game and those players, and getting people to follow those players.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ171 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default Is that working?
defaultKelly Simmonsdefault: Yes. There are about 100,000 people who are following those ambassadors. They are really helping to get the message out and to get fans to come to the game and increase the profile. They are really key to us, because ultimately fans want to engage with players.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ172 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default How do you choose those role models?
defaultKelly Simmonsdefault: We work with the clubs to identify the most appropriate person and then we support them in terms of training. That is really important, especially around social media these days, if they are using Twitter and

default. So we provide training and support and we have a weekly plan of key messages. There will be certain messages the club wants to get out and there are certain messages that we want to get out, which may be tuning in to the BBC to watch England or coming along to the next WSL game, or whatever those key messages are during the week, so it is a joint partnership with us and the clubs.
defaultNicky defaultPonsforddefault: We have a system where any player that is playing for 
defaultEngland
default as part of the agreement that we have with those players has an obligation to go to three events, whether they are a school, a county or a commercial event. Every player has to do three as a minimum per year.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ173 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default Are those three that you would choose for them, or are they ones that they choose themselves?
defaultNicky defaultPonsforddefault: A bit of both. Sometimes they would be something that is particularly relevant to them in their local community that they have put a request in to go and do. We will always look to support that where we possibly can, because it is really important that they are role models within their communities. We use that, we encourage as many girls as possible to work through the Youth Sport Trust as part of their ambassador programme. A number of girls are Sky Sports ambassadors, and we work very closely with the commercial partners in the RFU to make sure that we have good role models through the commercial partnerships—so, O
default2
default, Heathrow Express—which are all very much joint enterprises with the men and the women as part and parcel of that agreement.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ174 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default I want to ask a couple of questions about grassroots and elite, but I think it is probably easier to take rugby first and football second.
defaultFrom a rugby perspective, I am interested about pitch allocation. For example, in football quite often the girls’ teams get second dibs on the pitches; therefore they are playing at really inconvenient times. What is the experience in rugby?
defaultAlastair Marksdefault: We have just done a fairly extensive piece of research both with rugby players and females from other sports, and one of the key things that came out of that study, and out of rugby, was a need for a warm, welcoming and inclusive environment within rugby. I think it is fair to say that women traditionally play on Sunday within the rugby club—on a Sunday afternoon after the minis—and what we are now working on with our 200 focus clubs 
defaultas part of our strategy is to make sure that we are encouraging those clubs to give a fair share of pitch allocation and visibility to the women’s game on a Saturday, among the wider club programme; and also to encourage them to train culturally on the same nights so there is visibility of the women’s section within the club, but then working through the committees within those clubs to ensure that women are fairly represented at the leadership levels and the administrative levels of the club, which we know is so important.
default              
defaultWe do have a way to go. We are starting from a relatively low base in terms of the number of women’s clubs versus the number of men’s. You have around 350 now, out of the 2,000 member clubs we have available, but by focusing on the right culture and infrastructure and encouraging the visibility of the games at times when men’s rugby is traditionally played, we should start to see a shift in the coming years.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ175 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default Do you think there is still an element of sexism about women playing rugby at local level among those who are our rugby club leaders? Certainly many of the people I speak to at rugby clubs say, “I do not think women should be playing rugby. It is not right”.
defaultHelen Claytondefault: From my personal experience you will find they are the ones who have not watched it, so when someone has watched a game, whether it is a curtain raiser or like the RFU are doing at Twickenham—I think it is the same with football—you are aware of the skill sets that are involved. It is a slightly different game, but in my opinion better, and it is fun to watch and is still a good family environment. I think it is the lack of education that the visibility at clubs will improve and hopefully dispel.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ176 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default What about supporting those teams that are doing well in their level at the league? At the moment the finances at local rugby club level are still very difficult. I have Aylesford Rugby Club in my constituency—
defaultCath
default Spencer is playing; she is absolutely fantastic. It is their first season in the premiership, so it is a very proud moment for the club. They are not doing so well, but that is what you would expect in the first season in the premiership. They are doing better than the men’s team, but I still feel that perhaps the financial investment in the ladies’ team is second choice, and although the club is supportive, they are perhaps not as supportive as they would be if it was a men’s team.
defaultAlastair Marksdefault: In terms of RFU support now, the funding is for the major expenses, such as travel, and they are equitable across both men’s and women’s leagues, so the costs and the ratios of travel are absolutely there.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ177 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default So the ladies’ team would get support for subsidies for travel too?
defaultAlastair Marksdefault: Absolutely, and on parity with the men’s team. That is dictated on distance rather than who you are and the level you are at. We are also investing in the next four years over £1.5 million to support the infrastructure of the women’s game and invest in the areas where we believe it is needed most. Some of that is around marketing perception; some of that is around culture, physical kit and equipment. A significant amount of effort will also go into the female-focused volunteers, coaches and referees, to ensure that we are supporting the game to the right level. Certainly that is something that we will continue to do long into the future.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ178 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default What about investment in facilities? For example, there is quite a lot of research about women’s changing rooms. Most clubs will not have separate women’s changing rooms, so is there investment in infrastructure spend on facilities?
defaultAlastair Marksdefault: Absolutely. I will just refer to my notes to get the figures, but 70% of our clubs have a secure tenure over their own land. As part of our legacy around the 2015 World Cup, we are investing over £10 million of RFU funding in developing facilities—particularly on things like all-weather pitches, on clubhouses, social areas, toilets and changing rooms—which we do think will start to create a warm and welcoming environment for everybody coming into the club. Clearly part of our facilities investment and part of our facilities decisions of our counties are focused on their plans for women and girls, as well as the junior structure and the men’s games. We are investing ultimately what will be around £25 million worth in over 500 facilities in the next few years.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ179 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default Moving up a tier, about sponsorship for rugby, it is very difficult sometimes for women’s teams to get sponsorship. I congratulate the RFU on tying in the 
defaultEngland
default team matches with the men’s team matches and ensuring that the rights are negotiated around that, but how are you getting or improving commercial sponsorship for the women’s game?
defaultAlastair Marksdefault: At the moment we are very much treating all our sponsorships together, because of our “
defaultRugby
default for everyone” ambition. We make sure that all of our new commercial deals include, first, a grassroots element to them and, secondly, as part of that grassroots element, a focus on both the men’s and women’s games. For example, O
default2
default Touch is very much focused on men and women together. As you have already heard, our Canterbury All Schools programme is very much focused on providing equal opportunities for both boys and girls. That is very much the approach we will have for the foreseeable future. While the scale of the women’s game is perhaps not to the level it could be in order to attract its own sponsorships, certainly in the future we would hope that more female-specific and women-specific commercial sponsorships could become available. That is going to be done by continuing to raise the profile and continuing to raise the base of the numbers of girls and women that are involved in the game.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ180 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default Last question for rugby; your internal communication is fantastic. Touchline is brilliant in terms of promoting the women’s game, and I thought your annual report reflected a lot of the hard work that has been done and how you are promoting women not just within the RFU, but as a wider community. What are you doing to promote and to communicate the results, for example, of women’s games out to the national newspapers and how are you getting the message about women’s rugby out to a wider media?
defaultNicky defaultPonsforddefault: We recognise that the media plays a crucial role in promoting the game. The RFU employ a full-time communications manager to work on promoting, particularly, the elite women’s game, but has an overall remit for the women’s game. We get extensive coverage now in print, broadcast and social media. The World Cup that Mr Sutcliffe very kindly helped us get off the ground saw a real shift in media outlets for the women’s game. We saw a known audience of 77 million see some element of the Women’s World Cup. We have continued to try to drive that and use that.
defaultAll the women’s games are now available to be seen on different platforms—so, either Sky, BBC or RFU.com; they are all streamed. We use the men’s squad and management team to 
defaultcontinue to drive the coverage of the women’s game—so, England players supporting the England women’s team and that sort of avenue, through Twitter and 
defaultFacebook
default, joint press conferences for all of the women’s games around the QBE Internationals and the Six Nations, to help to drive print interest, Sky coverage and BBC coverage around news times. That is resulting in more and more column inches on a regular basis. We use things like 
defaulttalkSPORT
default to make sure that the premiership results go out to a wider audience every week—go out on RFU.com and go out on the RFU Twitter site. We are continuing to try to use as many different avenues through traditional media and social media as possible.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ181 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default But it could be better. The BBC now reports the Women’s Super League results on the back of their football results, and the papers print the results in their full results page. That is not yet the same for rugby, as far as I can tell—certainly in my paper of choice there is no Women’s premiership results printed on a Monday morning.
defaultNicky defaultPonsforddefault: No, the premiership results are not printed. I think we have an awful lot of coverage for our international games, and that is where we are getting most of our media coverage. It is only this year that we have really started to push the premiership in terms of making sure those results get advertised. Yes, we have further steps to go, but the BBC have done a good job. They are going to be showing the 
defaultIreland
default game live in the Six Nations post the men’s 
defaultIreland
default game. There will be highlights packages every week for the Six Nations games, so we are getting a lot more coverage around the big events that really help to promote the game, but there is always more that we would like to see and could push for.
defaultAlastair Marksdefault: Further to that, we are taking far more ownership of our own communications around the women’s game, so from the 
defaultIreland
default game next year right the way through to the Women’s World Cup, we will have a sustained 
defaultEngland
default rugby campaign effort behind that to support the game as well. For us, continuing to raise the visibility—continuing to work with the media and encourage the media to keep raising the profile of women’s sport—is absolutely key.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ182 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default The whole Six Nations issue has now been resolved, the Women’s Six Nations?
defaultNicky defaultPonsforddefault: Yes, for the foreseeable future.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ183 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default Good.
default              
defaultLet me turn to football. Going back to the issue of pitches, for example, the RFU are saying they have conducted a survey about it, trying to make sure that it is encouraged to have that equal access. What is the Football Association doing to try to support the girls’ game at the very grassroots level, down to pitch allocation?
defaultKelly Simmonsdefault: Since our partnership with the Premier League and the Government, with the Football Foundation investing nearly £750,000 into facilities, those facilities have to be for male and female, so they are called dual-gender changing rooms. In the old days, when I used to play, it was urinals and hope that the guys had gone. That is completely changing now, as any grant that is given has to make sure that it caters for male and female.
default              
defaultThe biggest issue is cost and quality of pitches, and without doubt the public sector cuts are really impacting on that. It gives me huge concerns, in terms of participation levels for male and 
defaultfemale football, that we are seeing price escalation. Local authorities are very quickly going from subsidised maintenance and running of facilities down to zero-based budgets, which in some areas are resulting in a potential 200% price increase, because leisure is not statutory—I think it should be; I think it is something that needs to be looked at.
default              
defaultThere needs to be an impact assessment of what is going on in terms of the cuts and what is happening both in terms of maintenance regimes around quality of pitches—which, when you talk to players, is the biggest thing they want in football: a decent pitch to play on—and price, which is going to prevent a lot of people from playing the game going forward. We are trying to manage that, working really hard to try to get across to 300-plus local authorities to try to find out what their plans are and work with them, but a number of those are multisport sites—it is not just a football issue—and it is a real concern.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ184 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default As an active coach and manager, I have never had any problems from any of the clubs that I am involved with or that we play against in terms of cost. Maintenance is a problem, mainly because they are quite often recreational grounds and it is not necessarily to do with what the council is doing as to what other people are doing to those grounds, particularly with their dogs. The problem is particularly acute in the girls’ game, about the timing that they are offered the pitches. Quite often you have to have all the men’s games played, the minis’ games played, and then the age groups then get their allocation. In the winter it is very difficult to have a 2 pm kick-off because you are practically playing in the dark at the end of it, so what I question is not so much the level of investment, in terms of financial investment into the pitches, but what is being done to encourage a better time allocation for girls and ladies to play football.
defaultKelly Simmonsdefault: Leagues can dictate when they want to play their games. Women’s football has traditionally been Sunday afternoon, which is the issue you talk about. Girls’ football really varies. Some leagues play on a Saturday and some play on a Sunday. I think perhaps cost has not impacted on some of the councils, but in the big metropolitan ones it is already starting to impact. Unless we can get in and find a better way, through asset transfers and different ways of working in partnership quickly, price will definitely be the biggest factor, not necessarily quality. Quality will come because the local authorities will not be able to run the maintenance programmes, but unless we can get that stock over to our good quality clubs, to run, maintain and support them with equipment grants, which we are gearing up to do and are doing, then cost and quality is going to be a real issue.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ185 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default Girls in particular drop out of football at around 14, 15 and 16, and it is very difficult to get a team together, let alone an active league. What is the FA trying to do to support the retention of girls at that age group in football?
defaultKelly Simmonsdefault: A number of things. We have a significant school-club link programme, with 7,000 girls in that programme currently to move those into local junior clubs. We are supporting clubs with grants to develop new teams—again, there are targets for that around girls’ teams. We have the new partnership with the Football League and the Premier League that was announced a couple of weeks ago at the Women’s Football Awards, very much working with the clubs, as I mentioned earlier, and the power of those brands to engage girls into football.
defaultFootball clubs have a huge coaching work force in those community trusts that we are working with to make sure they put the right offer on for girls and can feed those into clubs. We also acknowledge the fact that some girls want to play, but perhaps do not want to play in 
defaulta formal club structure. We have a programme called Team 16, and there is a big emphasis on intra-school football as well—so, very local, flexible recreational football for girls. Again, some of those will come through and it is about making sure that we get the right offer for the different age groups or desires of girls that want to play, be it competitive or more flexible and recreational.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ186 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default I hear what you are saying about announcing the recent partnership with the Football League and the Premiership, but do you think that some of the clubs will just do it as a token effort—that basically this is something that they have to do to tick a box?
defaultKelly Simmonsdefault: No, I do not think so. The Premier League and the Football League clubs already have a track record. A number of them have a very good track record of developing girls’ and women’s football, both through the community trust and increasingly through integrating the women’s and girls’ club within the club. We have seen that with the Women’s Super League—that probably the biggest change over the last three to four years is the integration of the women’s team, as opposed to maybe providing a bit of kit or support to the women’s team which is separate, or perhaps running it through the community trust, and instead integrating it within the club, so that the commercial team are supporting them commercially, likewise with marketing and communications, and the girls’ academies or centres of excellence are within the academies and the boys’ academies.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ187 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default That is not within every club, though. Arsenal is a good example of best practice.
defaultKelly Simmonsdefault: No, but I have seen a significant shift.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ188 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default For example, Chelsea Ladies does not play at 
defaultStamford
default 
defaultBridge
default.
defaultKelly Simmonsdefault: No, it does not, and at the moment, based on the number of fans, we would not want it to, because we are delivering live broadcasts every week next year on BT Sport. We are delivering a number of games through the BBC, and the message is very clear: it is about small, filled stadia, but they do train at Cobham at the men’s academy, so they do have access. The girls’ centre of excellence and the women’s team have world-class training facilities and expertise down there that they are accessing. A few years ago that would not have been the case, and there are a number of Football League and Premier League clubs that I could cite that are integrated properly and the women’s games are getting more and more expertise, resources and facilities as a result of that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ189 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default Your Game Changer plan has caused a bit of a furore within the Women’s Premier League in particular, and there is a real or perceived threat from the proposals that it is going to have a significant impact on clubs in the lower leagues of women’s football—not just financial, but also from things such as participation and whether or not there is going to be enough competition in terms of removing promotion and relegation. Do you want to say a few words about that? Let me be clear: there is a vested interest here. It affects ladies who play in 
defaultChatham
default 
defaultTown
default, so let me just put that on the record. I am concerned that here is a club that is doing incredibly well—it is at the top of the league—and under these proposals would not be able to be promoted into the higher levels as a consequence.
defaultKelly Simmonsdefault: It is important to go back to why we created a new Women’s Super League. With the old Women’s Premier League there were amateur footballers—and when I say “amateur” I mean non-paid, run by volunteers, poor facilities, a lot of postponements, played across the winter in very poor conditions, no fans. We felt that if we were going to elevate the game to a completely new level on the domestic level, we needed to do something completely different. In consultation with all of the partners in the game and the clubs, we decided to create the Super League across the summer, so that we do not go head-to-head all the time with men’s football. Really importantly, if we are going to build a fan base, which is absolutely fundamental, ultimately, to professional women’s football—and which I think we need to do if we want to compete on a global scale and raise our game—then playing across the summer is something that is more likely to attract families in. That was a starting point.
defaultAs soon as you say, “We’re going to play across the summer and put our elite football across the summer,” to try to give it that spotlight to grow and develop it—all the indicators, including commercial partners, broadcast partners, fan numbers and so on, would indicate that has been the right move—then you are going to have a separate pyramid.
default              
defaultAcknowledging that we cannot have a closed Women’s Super League—obviously we are launching the second division in March next year—what we are going to have is our elite players, our semi-professionals, moving to professional women’s football, and I do not think it is unrealistic that the WSL could be fully professional within three to four years in the summer. Then you have your winter pyramid, and unfortunately, because of timing, you cannot relegate and promote. We have set that up and created that for our elite players with a club licensing model, A-licensed coaches, the right sort of sports science, sports medicine, facilities, moving from training once a week to training every day—these are our Olympians, after all.
default              
defaultThen you have the rest of the game, which is amateur in the sense of non-paid, but in the winter pyramid. What we need to do, and what we will do over the short to medium term, is talk to the game about at what point do other people want to come across and join a summer pyramid or do you want to say, “Well, I am going to be recreational and my goal is going to be top of the winter pyramid,” but accept the fact that you either move the summer league back to winter—which I think would be a disaster, because whatever indicator you want to use Women’s Super League has dramatically raised the profile and raised the standard of women’s football—move all of the winter pyramid over? That is going to take time because you have women’s clubs who are on local authority pitches, and there might be cricket and so on. You have to do it over a period of time, in conjunction with those clubs. We have WSL 1 and now we have WSL 2, and obviously we need to have those discussions. It is a very transformational time for the women’s game.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ190 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default There is no doubt of the FA’s commitment to the Women’s Super League. It has been good and it has put professional football on an international level, which is fantastic. We are talking about the amateur league that needs the support in order for it to grow, and therefore removing FA branding, for example, from the league and reducing the amount of money that clubs are going to get. Therefore they are going to be sharing £90,000 per season between 72 clubs, which is £1,200 a year and does not get you anything. It does not buy you any support. At the moment you have good teams at a very local level that are developing the best of our future players, and yet the FA is pulling back and concentrating on what appears to be the money-maker for the FA.
defaultKelly Simmonsdefault: It certainly does not make money. To be clear, the FA is investing significantly in WSL; it does not wash its face.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ191 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default It has invested £2.5 million. That is not a significant amount of money in terms of football.
defaultKelly Simmonsdefault: Additional money into Game Changer, the strategy, we are agreeing, I think. I am saying we invest into Women’s Super League. It does not make money for the FA. We are a not-for-profit organisation. We are investing our money into infrastructure within those clubs to help them ultimately become sustainable and professional. About the Women’s Premier League, there are two issues. One is a claim that we have cut the money. What you are seeing out there from the Save Our Women’s Premier League campaign is not like-for-like. Women’s Premier League used to be level 1, the top level of women’s football, and levels 1 and 2 had £180,000 between them. We now put £1.3 million into levels 1 and 2 of the women’s game. Old level 3, which is what Women’s Premier League is now, used to be £40,000. We are putting in a £90,000 grant plus the income plus administrative support, so probably about a £140,000 package. The big issue is about changing the Women’s Premier League but ultimately it is really confusing. When you talk with the fans, the broadcasters and the commercial partners level 3 being called the Premier League is really confusing. It was the top level of women’s football. Unfortunately it is not now and therefore people muddle up the Super League and the Premier League. If anyone wanted an example it was this week when Sky said to me, “Kelly, I need to talk to you about the Women’s Super League” and I said, “What is that?” and they said, “About the campaign”. I said, “Do you mean the Premier League?” and they said, “What is the difference?” Therein lies the issue. It is really confusing. If we are going to sell and market the game we need a coherent structure. I appreciate that will upset people that have retained a position in the Premier League as the Super League has grown, but it is not the Premier. It is level 3 now for women’s football.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ192 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default You are saying that those who fear that these changes are going to threaten the future of women’s football below the Women’s Super League and that it will stop people and clubs getting involved in ladies football and supporting ladies’ football, either through financial or other means, are wrong to think that?
defaultKelly Simmonsdefault: First of all, I think it is a handful of clubs. I was with a number of clubs at the weekend in the Women’s Premier League who do not agree with the campaign at all. I would not suggest it is all the Women’s Premier League. We talk to them regularly and they are back in again at the beginning of February where we can have further dialogue with them, but I do not think it is across the board. There are a lot of people in the Women’s Premier League who are supportive and understand what we are doing. There is a lot of misinformation. I am due to write to all the Women’s Premier League clubs again this week just to set out what is fact and what is fiction. We are there to support the whole of the winter pyramid and we have worked really hard on the bottom level to create county leagues, which is ultimately where your mass participation is. To say that we are ignoring the winter pyramid I do not think is fair, because we have worked really hard over the last two or three years to make sure that at the very bottom of that pyramid there is a strong women
default’
defaults and girls’ county, local league. The numbers are growing in the women’s pyramid, which is bucking the trend of men’s football.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ193 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default Why is the FA going to remove its branding?
defaultKelly Simmonsdefault: The FA does not normally run leagues, so the only league that it runs at the moment is the Women’s Super League and the Women’s Premier League, so we ran the top level 
defaultof women’s football to try to drive that forward and invest in it. All the other leagues are run separately from the FA and the FA is the governing body of it. At the moment we would be left in a situation where we run levels 1, 2, 3 and 4 and we are going to administer them but in consultation with the clubs and agreed by the clubs. We felt it was time to support them with administration and grants, but to let the clubs run their league themselves. We can have that discussion again with the clubs because, to all intents and purposes, we are running it but through administration, grants and support. At the time the clubs felt it was probably a good time for them to run the league, so I do not think that is a big issue from our point of view. We are saying it is going to be called the championship supported by the FA, with a whole support package alongside it, but run by a management committee with the clubs as the predominant league, which is how the other 1,500 leagues are run in this country. But I think the big issue for them is the name change. It just goes back to that point of having a really clear and coherent structure.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ194 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Sutcliffe:default Just quickly on issues around leadership and role models, part of the problem for all sports is the lack of women in senior positions. I think, Alastair, you said that four of the nine executive board members are women. How did that come about? I can remember the days when we had the blazers and all the issues around governing bodies. What has promoted that? What has started that to happen and that change to take place?
defaultAlastair Marksdefault: Firstly, in terms of the executive board, that is the RFU executive staff so they have purely been appointed based on merit and based on their skill set, both in terms of their ability to carry out the roles that they are doing. I will defer to Nicky for the wider leadership opportunities within the union at council and management level.
defaultNicky defaultPonsforddefault: Yes, as Alastair said, the executive board is relatively well represented. We recognise we have a bit more work to do at other levels within the organisation, but the work that the RFU is doing we feel that the crucial change is to make sure that there is a healthy pipeline of women coming through the organisation to feed into those leadership positions. We recognise that we are not there at the moment. We have two female members on the council. The first one was elected this year and that is a significant step in the right direction. We are working very hard with our clubs and our constituent bodies or county bodies to bring women into leadership positions on those bodies. We have a number of examples of chairs and presidents at clubs now and those people are feeding into the—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ195 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Sutcliffe:default Do you fund any development courses, educational courses? Do you do any funding around that to try to get coaches, more administrators and that sort of thing? If I was a girl leaving school and wanted to get a career in rugby union, what support mechanisms are there, is what I am trying to get to? How would you go about it?
defaultNicky defaultPonsforddefault: There are a number of different things that are being run at the moment. One example is the Young Ambassador’s Scheme, which has just been launched as part of the 2015 legacy work of where each club had to provide at least one female representative coming into the Young Ambassador’s programme, which has kick-started a number of those people into the game that were not necessarily involved in the game anyway. They will have a series of support, workshops, to develop their skills and be involved in the game.
default              
defaultIn terms of women coming into coaching or refereeing, we are always looking to promote women coming into the game because, as I said before, it is very important that we have the right coaches for the right teams, whether that is a female coach with a male team or a male coach with a female team or whatever. We do not specifically run female-only courses, but we encourage females to go through on to the RFU programme. We are working a lot with the focus clubs, which Alastair was talking about, to make sure that they have females coming through as volunteers, females coming through as coaches, through the QBE sponsored coaching programmes, so the number of places for females to come through into coaching role through that is being encouraged. As I say, we have not set specific female courses because we have done it in the past and we did not find it as successful so we are trying to make sure that it is a warm and friendly environment coming on coaching courses as well as going into clubs and everything else.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ196 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Sutcliffe:default What I see in rugby union is a more integrated approach and I see evidence on the ground of that integration taking place.
defaultLet us turn now to football, Kelly. This Committee has had a few things to say about governance of football and issues around that. From your perspective, how do you think things are going and what are the FA trying to do to address some of the issues that we have raised in terms of the role of women’s football? I hear what you are saying about the restructuring, but I do feel that the money that goes into the Premier League through the TV deals you do not have a great deal of control over. But they are constituent members of the FA and a greater amount of money could go into the women’s game. How is it looking from your perspective at the moment?
default 
defaultKelly Simmonsdefault: Obviously there has been quite a dialogue with the Government and the FA around the makeup of the board, which we have made some changes on, fans, which there have been some developments on, and licensing. I am not the lead on those but I know that there has been some progress made and dialogue continues on that.
default              
defaultIn terms of investment, obviously today we talked specifically about investment into women’s specific programmes but on top of that the way the FA is structured with the national game and the professional game. The other part of my job is to oversee the national game, which is all football outside of the Premier League and the Football League, and through the way the FA is set up we invest £50 million a year into national game programmes to grow participation and support the game outside of the professional game. All of our programmes are for girls and boys, men and women, and obviously significant resources and support go to the women’s and girls’ game as well.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ197 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Sutcliffe:default You talked about the relationship between the Government, the FA, the Football League, the Premier League and the Football Foundation. I just wonder if more could be done. You said that the girls’ and women’s games were the fastest growing behind the men’s equivalent in football and cricket. If more money came in from the TV deals to the women’s game, I would suggest you would see a greater involvement in terms of greater participation and greater support for the game.
defaultKelly Simmonsdefault: Yes. I hope this answers it. Obviously at the moment the FA invests significantly in the women’s game, through the national game strategy and through the game change in the women’s strategy. We are also trying to make sure that the game generates revenues itself. So we have separated out the commercial rights and are selling them separately for the first time. We hope to make circa £5 million of new revenue to invest into the game through our commercial programme, which over the next four year period we think 
defaultcould grow to £10 million, £12 million, £14 million. So we start to generate revenues from the women’s game itself on top of the investment that we make, which we think is really important. While the revenues come back into the FA—and, as you know, are split 50/50 national game, professional game, outside of our central costs—obviously anything else we can generate, in terms of the women’s game, on top of the money we get through the 50/50 split is only going to help the women’s game.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ198 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Sutcliffe:default That is a good answer and I think you are right to do that, to generate revenues and income. But to get to the highest level, which we need to do to compete internationally, it has to grow a lot faster than it is doing notwithstanding all the good work that has gone on particularly over the last few years.
defaultKelly Simmonsdefault: Yes, we are going to compete globally and to give our athletes the best chance they have to be full-time professional. We have made a massive shift in three years from a completely amateur sport to semi-professional. What we are seeing this year as we go into 2014, most of those clubs will be training full-time. That is a massive improvement. So licensed coaches, sports science, sports medicine, training full-time and expert facilities, that is what is going to shift our game on a global level.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ199 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Sutcliffe:default Do not think I am criticising—
defaultKelly Simmonsdefault: No, absolutely.
defaultMr Sutcliffe:default We proved it with the Olympics that you have to make people full-time. That is why we did so well with the UK Sport’s support for athletes. That needs to happen with the women’s game as well. I do think, while it is right to generate your own revenues and your own income streams, that football could still do a lot more for the women’s game and I would hope they would do it.
defaultKelly Simmonsdefault: Yes, but it needs to be sustainable, does not it? We need to make sure that the game washes its face so it is not at the whim of benefactors.
defaultMr Sutcliffe:default Yes. Thanks.
defaultChair:default Thank you all very much. We need to get on with the next session. That has been very helpful. Thank you.

defaultWitnesses:
default 
defaultJoanna Adamsdefault, Director of Marketing and 
defaultCommercial
default, 
defaultEngland
default Netball, 
defaultChris Boardmandefault, Policy Adviser, and 
defaultEmma defaultPooleydefault, British Cycling, and
default Nick defaultHumbydefault, Chief Operating Officer, Lawn Tennis Association, gave evidence.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ200 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Good morning. For the second part of this morning’s session, I welcome Joanna Adams, the Director of Marketing and Commercial at England Netball, Chris Boardman, Policy Adviser, and Emma 
defaultPooley
default of British Cycling and Nick 
defaultHumby
default, Chief Operating Officer of the Lawn Tennis Association. Could you start by giving a general overview? If you could tell us what proportion of grassroots players are female, what you are doing to promote female participation and what progress you are making?
defaultJoanna Adamsdefault: Shall I start?
defaultChair:default One of those questions probably is not as relevant to you.
defaultJoanna Adamsdefault: I thought that is why I would start because it is obviously not quite as relevant. I am from England Netball, so obviously predominantly it is a female game.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ201 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Just out of interest, how many men play netball?
defaultJoanna Adamsdefault: We have about 300 affiliated members but quite a lot of men play in the social leagues, especially in 
defaultLondon
default where there is quite a lot of Australian and New Zealanders, but we are predominantly a female game.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ202 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Perhaps you could go on then to tell us what you are doing to promote participation and how successful you think you are being?
defaultJoanna Adamsdefault: We think we are being extremely successful. Obviously we were very fortunate with our funding from Sport England. We received the third highest funding from Sport England and that was based on the growth of our participation numbers. That did not come as a boost from 2012; they have grown significantly over the last three years. We do not think that is a mistake. We think we know exactly how we have done that. About 3½ years ago we set out on a journey of basically putting the consumer at the centre of everything that we do. So we took our game and we said, “It is fantastic. It is a seven-a-side game and lots of ladies love to play that game, but they are the ladies that affiliate to us and they are our members and we need a new audience”. We basically looked at different forms of our game. We went out and we did a massive amount of research. We basically asked women and girls what they wanted from netball and we have created different forms of our game that are very relevant to those different consumer groups. I think we have tackled it more like a business rather than a sport but put the participant at the centre of absolutely everything that we do. That growth we have increased by 34% in the last four years.
default              
defaultA very significant product that we have is called Back to Netball. We aim to bring an average of 10,000 new participants into netball through Back to Netball over the next four years. So we think we are doing some things quite right and bucking the trend.
defaultNick defaultHumbydefault: Our ambition at the Lawn Tennis Association is get to get more people playing more often. Over the last 18 months we have been doing quite a lot of research and talking to other national governing bodies about the opportunities ahead of us. It is very clear that women and girls are one of those opportunities for us to get more people playing more often. We are a pretty gender balanced sport—44% of people who play weekly are women—and we have good role models in people like Judy Murray and Laura Robson who can inspire people to take up the game. We also get good media coverage.
default              
defaultWe have an opportunity here to grasp this. We have two strong foundations that will enable us to realise this opportunity. The first is in education. Since 2009 we have been investing in putting 
defaultAegon
default school packs into schools. We are now in 16,700 schools. That enables teachers—who we help train and show how to use the kit—to introduce children to tennis is an accessible, easy way to play with a low compression ball. We think about 2 million kids are experiencing tennis through our school activities. That is borne out by the DCMS Taking Part survey. That is one strength. That is about 50:50 
defaultmale:female
default. That is very important because 6% 
defaultof all people who play tennis start in the school environment. If we get them young we can take them through the whole life journey of playing the sport.
default              
defaultThe second opportunity, which we launched earlier this year, was Cardio Tennis. Cardio is an aerobic workout using tennis drills, licensed from the States. We have been testing it and trialling it and we launched it here earlier in the year. About 800 venues now run Cardio Tennis. What we found in our research and in focus groups is this is a way of introducing tennis to women, in particular, who want a fun, social, fitness experience and not necessarily a competitive experience. So what we are doing now is working with partners to try to roll out Cardio Tennis across the landscape to encourage more women to come into our game or move from a gym environment into a tennis environment. You can do that in spaces other than on normal courts. It is a huge opportunity for us and we have become—using all of the insight and knowledge we have gathered, using these tools and foundations—a way of getting more people playing over the coming 18 months, two years.
defaultChris Boardmandefault: I think we have been very lucky with the amount of Olympic success that we have had in cycling over the last few years. Perhaps, unlike a lot of sports, cycling itself crosses over into general every day use for transport as well, so we have a real opportunity to do an awful lot with it. In 2008 and 2012, 10 of the Olympic medals that we got were women’s medals, gold medals. That is despite there being a gender imbalance between the number of events for both sexes.
default              
defaultWe have seen an increase of 1.1 million more people now riding bikes over this period and well over one-third of that is women as well. There are a number of activities taking place at the grassroots level. I am sure you will be aware that the Sportive Event—the challenge event I think it is called—is becoming more and more popular. There are over 800 of those events now around the 
defaultUK
default. British Cycling has teamed up with Sky, which has enabled them to do some targeted things. They have seen nearly 150,000 people attend events in 2012 and 2013. Since the start of that programme in 2009 650,000 people have taken part in those events alone. So we are seeing membership increase year-on-year. At British Cycling we have a membership now of 85,000. Historically it has always been a much more male-dominated sport, but the increase in women’s participation and membership is coming on year-on-year as well.
defaultEmma defaultPooleydefault: I will just add to that. British Cycling is doing a very good job of specifically encouraging women to ride at the grassroots level. There is a programme of rides called the Breeze Rides, which are directly targeted at women to reduce the perceived barriers. It is quite a male-dominated sport. It can be a bit frightening when you start out as a women riding and I think that is helping to get women riding, enjoying it and discovering that it is fun at whatever level, whether it is commuting or training or not even wanting to do a challenge ride.
defaultThe Go-Ride programme, which is the under-16s programme, is 50:50 girls and boys. Those programmes are for under-16s. They are partly talent spotting but they are also linked up with local cycling clubs, so that when children get to the age of 16 and they are no longer in the Go-Ride programme they are already in a club environment where cycling is sociable and fun and you want to go even when it is raining because you are going to see your friends and stop for coffee or something. That is a very positive encouragement at the grassroots level.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ203 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default Could I just ask where you stand on the women’s Tour de France?
defaultEmma defaultPooleydefault: I stand out, possibly. I have commented a few times that I think it would be a positive thing for cycling as a whole—not just for women’s cycling—to have a women’s Tour 
defaultde France purely because it is the most high profile cycling race there is. In my opinion, there is a vast disparity at the competitive level, the professional level of the sport. It is a vicious circle of media coverage, lack of knowledge about it, leading on to lack of investment and, therefore, lack of media coverage and lack of participation. I am a professional cyclist and what annoys me is when people say to me, “Why aren’t you at the Tour de France” and I think, “When did you ever see a woman doing the Tour de France?” I think there is a real opportunity there. It is a massive event. It would be hugely positive if they put on a women’s race. But obviously it is also a commercial event. You cannot legislate and force them to do it. I can also see that there are barriers to it in terms of the logistical challenges. They already have a successful formula and their job is not to solve the world’s problems and answer my feminist 
defaultrantings
default; their job is to make money. They have to see a profit somewhere. I have campaigned about it. I started a petition and we got nearly 100,000 signatures. We asked the organisers of the Tour de France to respond to us because we had enough people complaining about it. But I am well aware that organising a race is a commercial venture and therefore things like prize money and wages for professional riders is all dictated by the commercial interests.
default              
defaultThe key thing is the media coverage because if there is sufficient media coverage then it attracts responses and so the professional side will grow on its own. On the other side, it also fulfils its job as a professional sport because no one has a right to earn money from sport. You cannot say, “I deserve to earn as much as a male cyclist” because it is dictated by commercial interests. I think the job of a professional sport is to showcase that sport to young people and essentially to set an example to inspire people. I know when I was a kid I was massively inspired by Paula Radcliffe, for example. If the sport never appears on television then it is not doing that job. The encouragement of TV coverage is—
default              
defaultChair:default Gerry, just before you come in, Angie is going to have to disappear in a second, so—
defaultQ204 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Sutcliffe:default Just on the Tour de France, I just want to point out that it starts in 
defaultYorkshire
default next year.
defaultEmma defaultPooleydefault: Yes, I couldn’t agree more with your pointing that out.
defaultMr Sutcliffe:default I think that is a significant opportunity. It is great and already the interest there is fantastic, but that might be an opportunity to highlight the need for a women’s equivalent.
defaultEmma defaultPooleydefault: Yes, I have suggested it. Obviously it not my job to organise the Tour de France but I think there is definitely a massive media interest in the 
defaultUK
default. I have raced all over Europe and I know that the interest in the 
defaultUK
default is almost second to none now. Perhaps 
defaultHolland
default it is a bit higher but it is a potential opportunity. You also have to consider that it fits into an overall programme of the professional sport and the start of the Tour de France clashes with the start of Women’s Giro 
defaultd’Italia
default, which is our biggest race of the year. If I had to decide between a one-day race in 
defaultYorkshire
default or trying to win the Giro I would personally be a bit torn.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ205 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default Following on from that, there is this ongoing row about prize money, for something like 
defaultWimbledon
default, and I am interested to get your take on that. Because it would seem that the television does cover the women’s tennis just as much as it does the men’s at 
defaultWimbledon
default, for instance, but there is still this disparity in prize money. It is not as bad as it was but I think there is still some. Even so, the fact is the ticket money would tend to 
defaultdemonstrate that the tickets for the men’s finals go for more than women’s, which would indicate that the public are still far more mesmerised by the men’s tennis than the women’s. So what more can we do about that because there does seem to be this perception that the men’s tennis is more exciting?
defaultNick defaultHumbydefault: I think we are quite proud that 
defaultWimbledon
default offers the same prize money for men and women. It sets a standard example and that is a very positive thing for—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ206 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default 
defaultBut the ticket money clearly shows this.
defaultNick defaultHumbydefault: The audiences who watch those sports at 
defaultWimbledon
default are very strong female audiences. The attendances are a strong gender mix. So it is taking the opportunity of 
defaultWimbledon
default and the profile and that equality in prize money, to convert that and make them feel that it is a sport they should engage with. Our challenge is to engage with them and get more people playing. That is what we are focused on in the LTA.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ207 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default Nevertheless, if you are buying tickets from the touts, the men’s tickets go for an awful lot more money than the women’s. I am not saying that I do but that is what I hear.
defaultNick defaultHumbydefault: Possibly. One of the events we organise is down at 
defaultEastbourne
default and we have seen attendances continue to grow there. That is principally a women’s event and its history is as a women’s event. We have seen that growing. Our classic in 
defaultEdgbaston
default is a women’s event and we have seen attendances growing there. So we are seeing growth in that. It helps when you have a Laura Robson, a British star, or a Heather Watson starring in those events. That would draw people in and make it a more appealing thing to watch.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ208 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default One of the things that is striking is that studies show that girls and women on the whole prefer non-competitive sports to competitive sports. Do you think there is a case to be made for putting more funding into that kind of sport? For instance, perhaps subsiding gyms or perhaps doing more with swimming, which tend to be less competitive?
defaultNick defaultHumbydefault: From our point of view, our research absolutely supports that thought process. We have done a lot of focus group work and clearly, “What are the barriers to more women playing tennis?” They want a fun, social experience. They want a fitness experience. They do not necessarily want a competitive experience. So that is where Cardio Tennis for us is a great opportunity because it offers that social, fun experience. What we are trying to do is work through partners, whether it is a Virgin Active, a David Lloyd, local authorities or the people who run leisure centres to offer Cardio as a way of taking women out of gyms and into a different more fun experience. We are seeing some success with that. We have a lot more to do to promote it and we are working hard through those partners to do that. That is a way into our sport because once you have had an aerobic experience with a tennis drill, then perhaps you will go on and play a short form of tennis or another adapted form of the game.
defaultEmma defaultPooleydefault: I find it uncomfortable the stereotyping of women not wanting to do competitive sport because obviously I race.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ209 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default I am only citing studies that seem to suggest that that is the case.
defaultEmma defaultPooleydefault: I do agree that there are plenty of women, and people in general, that want to do sport but they never want to do a race in their life. In terms of cycling, I think that is great as long as they ride a bike because it is a fun sport in itself and you never have to race. It is not a black and white issue; it merges from one to another. I know people in my local club in 
defaultNorwich
default who took up cycling on a Sunday to lose a bit of weight and within two years they were racing at the local race series. They do not have to. They have lost more than the weight they wanted to. The great thing about sport—and it does not have to be cycling, any kind of social sport—the difference between that and going to the gym, say, is that it is sociable. Whether it is a Sunday ride or racing you turn up not just because you know you should and you ate a mince pie last night. You turn up because you know your mate is going to be there and you want to go and see them and I think that is a very powerful—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ210 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default Are you suggesting that one can lead to the other? That you start out by enjoying a sociable cycling ride and then you end up quite enjoying the competition?
defaultEmma defaultPooleydefault: Yes, exactly. I found cycling very daunting when I took it up. I started late. I was a runner and I was injured. I only took it up to cross-train. I did not really enjoy it to start with and I ended up racing.
defaultChris Boardmandefault: Doing quite well.
defaultEmmadefault 
defaultPooleydefault: Yes, and 
defaultI
default did not ever mean to. I never thought I would be a professional cyclist.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ211 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default Do you think there is an untapped demand for sport among women?
defaultChris Boardmandefault: Yes, there is. Our surveys show that there is an untapped demand of over 1 million and it is British Cycling’s intention to go after that and pursue that. We have made that a specific target by 2020. The biggest, single concern of our membership has been safety. More importantly than that, over 64% of people said they would take up cycling if it was safer. So our road infrastructure is heavily tied into to us activating more people cycling. Safety is the biggest single thing.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ212 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default 
defaultEngland
default Netball says, “
defaultThe expectations of our 10 identified audiences challenged our assumptions of what the sport should look like, how it should be delivered and who should deliver it
default”. Do you want to talk a bit more about that?
defaultJoanna Adamsdefault: Yes. We do not like to categorise women and girls obviously but we did—we live and breathe these bubbles at England Netball—and we have put them basically into 10 different categories. We have identified through that what their motivations are. There will be some women who basically just want to meet other women. So we have put sport as the focus of something where they can just go and meet other women. Back to Netball. For instance, the first 10 minutes of the first session they may well just chat. It does not matter what they turn up in, what they wear. There is no competitive element to this whatsoever. This is about women coming together. It might be that they have had babies and they are worried about, “God, I do not want to go to a gym”. By about week five of that we find that 30% of them want to transition into a different form of the game and that is probably a little bit more competitive. Another 30% will affiliate to us. They will go on to play competitive sport. But we still have this 30% that just want that social element and we have to make sure 
defaultthat there are “pay and play” offers for them. We have to accept that there are some women that do not want to go on and compete and they want the kind of gym experience in a team environment.
default              
defaultWe have been very conscious as well about the entry level for our sport. You do not have to join as a team because team sport is very difficult to encourage people to play because it is that whole nervousness about going along, “Will I fit in? What is my position going to be?” A lot of what we have done is around the entry level to that sport. That is about individuals being able to go in but then become part of the group, who may or may not at some point become part of a team that plays in a league.
default              
defaultWhat we hope is that we have people who do what we call “bubble hop”. So they go from one to another and ultimately we keep them in the game. But if that form of the game is up here, which is competition, we do not force this lady down here if she does not want it. We have also looked very carefully at the places where people want to play and also at the times. We have done a heck of a lot of work with women about when the convenient times are for them to participate in sport. As I say, it is not a surface thing for this at netball. This was not a tick boxing exercise, this is a real culture. Absolutely everything we do, when we look at putting on an event, when we look at a coaching strategy, it is all about how that will affect our consumer. I think that is absolutely key to our success.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ213 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default Which groups of women cause you most concern in terms of non-participation?
defaultJoanna Adamsdefault: We assumed the 14 to 18-year-olds. That is our biggest drop off and obviously Sport England target us very heavily to bring that group back in. I talk about Back to Netball a lot because it is such a successful programme. But that was aimed at 25-plus market. It was very successful the first year but then we actively tried to place that within the lifestyle press and we used some quite innovative ways to get to that younger age group. Although 14 to 18-year-olds have caused us a huge problem, we have now seen a growth in that area and the growth in Back to Netball has started to drop in age.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ214 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default You talk about “innovative”, what sorts of things were you doing?
defaultJoanna Adamsdefault: Other sports always laugh at us but I am going to give you one idea that we are very proud of. I hope it does not sound shallow in such esteemed company. One of the barriers for our sport—and we do look at barriers all the time for sports—is girls do not want to play because they do not want to look sweaty. Some people might laugh at that but that is a real reason why a teenager does not want to play sport. For us one of the main reasons is girls do not want to cut their nails off because you have to have very short nails. With the influences of TOWIE and all the glam stuff—long nails are glamorous and so forth—we got 
defaultSophy
default Robson, who did the Olympic girls’ nails, to design us seven netball nails. So really quite cool and great for our netballers because it gave us great content for stuff, but we knew that the lifestyle press would pick that up. We want to be in 
defaultCosmo
default, we want to be in 
defaultVogue
default, we want to be in 
defaultGracia
default, we want to be in 
defaultStylist
default. I am not that bothered about being in the back pages of newspapers. Basically we ran this whole campaign about great netball nails. We got our 
defaultEngland
default girls involved with it as role models and 26 million people saw that campaign. It was very successful for us; it changed the perception of our sports for those who play but also those girls that do not play. It might have only moved them a tiny little bit but it might have moved them that little bit. So things like that we do.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ215 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default What about cycling? Do you think there is something there for you?
defaultEmma defaultPooleydefault: There are significant barriers to people taking up cycling, men and women, in terms of it is a high entry cost sport. You have to have a bike somehow, whether you borrow it or buy it. That is a cost, and also the clothing just to stay warm at this time of year. British Cycling have been working with some bike shops—it sounds terrible again—women friendly bike shops. It is terribly daunting when you take up the sport to start with. There is a lot of technology involved and you are worried that you are going to walk into a bike shop and get fleeced. So there is work to be done there.
default              
defaultIt is unavoidable in cycling that there is some barrier in terms of the equipment needed. There is also the perception that cycling involves Lycra and a lot of sweat, possibly a lot of rain and muddy puddles and things—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ216 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default 
defaultHow do you get past that?
defaultEmma defaultPooleydefault: I never cared because I was a cross-country runner but obviously people do, and that is where the role of role models is important. We have some super glamorous role models in cycling: Victoria Pendleton, Laura 
defaultTrott
default, and Lizzie 
defaultArmitstead
default, who manage to look fantastic at the end of a sweaty race. I honestly think it has made a difference, especially Victoria Pendleton. It is not an avenue that I think I can personally can go down but I am impressed that she has, and it is really good because it shows that you can be the best cyclist and super glamorous, and not look macho.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ217 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default So role models are important?
defaultEmma defaultPooleydefault: Yes, I think they are. I feel quite strongly that you do not have to be glamorous. I do not like the fact that the media assume you have to be glamorous to be successful, but it is good to show that—
defaultAngie Bray:default It does not stop you being glamorous.
defaultEmma defaultPooleydefault: —it does not stop you being glamorous and then people might get into riding and realise that it is not that bad getting covered in mud.
defaultNick defaultHumbydefault: I think the question was about the age groups. What we see in tennis is very good equal gender participation in school and by the time we get to 55 it is equal again. This period in between, how do you address that? It is very interesting being here between cycling and netball because both of these sports have been in to our board, and we have started to learn from them. What Joanna was saying about understanding the customer and how you market and promote the sport, and how you tailor the offer, is what we are in the process of learning. That is one of the reasons why the focus groups that we have been doing have focused us on the opportunity of 21 to 34-year-olds and how Cardio Tennis might be a solution that would meet some of that group and help them back into it. So that is what we are doing. Following their example we are focusing on where we can make a difference and then working through partners to explain that insight and help them get what they want as well, which is to get more customers through the door wherever their facility is.
defaultChris Boardmandefault: This is only partially related. I did a study about 10 years ago because we found that we were doing 15,000 tests in schools a year in a talent search programme, and we were getting one or two athletes through to the Olympics podium so it was a really low return and we were trying to find out why that was. Part of that study threw up that the peer group 
defaultage was absolutely critical. If you gave people an activity to do once a week or something they could be involved in twice a week it was not enough, you were not part of their peer group, their social structure or their parent’s social structure. So we had to create opportunities at least three times a week so it became part of their social structure. That is partially how the Go-Ride programme came about. There were 100,000 opportunities last year alone in that. That is why it is very important that the Go-Ride was linked up to the clubs to get that participation all the way through.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ218 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default Talking to the previous panel we talked about the experience of sport at school, and 51% of women suggest they got put off the whole concept of sport when they were at school. There was agreement across the previous panel that we need to do more to address how sport is taught in schools. What would you like to say about that? Sport and PE.
defaultJoanna Adamsdefault: It is a weird one for us because I think absolutely all the evidence shows that women are like, “Oh my goodness, sport sessions” and yet one of our great successes is that netball brings back that feeling of being at school. We are a strange one because every woman remembers it and whether it is a good feeling or a bad feeling for some bizarre reason they want to feel it again. We are not too sure. That is probably the one bit of insight we just do not know. If you ask a group of women, they are like, “Oh God, I hated netball at school. It was just awful. It was cold and it was windy”. “Oh, there is a Back to Netball session around the corner from you.” “I would love to go.”
defaultAngie Bray:default I just remember the fact that at netball the girls that were taller always seemed to be better than the rest of us.
defaultJoanna Adamsdefault: Yes, our elite girls are very tall.
defaultWe have re-marketed our game within schools. So we have just re-branded our complete school offer. In effect, they are playing the same game because the insight said that is still the game that girls want to play in school. Everything that goes into school, all our collateral now, you will not see a bib on anything. Every young girl that we asked, they were like, “Do not show me playing netball with a bib on”. So it is very cool. It is very trendy. It is language that they understand and it uses a lot of Twitter language. There is no bib in sight and the focus of everything we have done to promote it in school is about the ball. The game is the same but it is the way that we have sold it into schools to make it more relevant for a younger market.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ219 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default What about the sports teachers themselves? Is there a cultural shift that we need there or an attitude?
defaultJoanna Adamsdefault: I think there is. We have a great workforce of community coaches. Our volunteer network is fantastic but our community coaches are taught to coach in a very different way now. Some schools could learn from some of the learning that the governing bodies have now as to how to sell sport to a younger age group. So there could be some learning there, I think.
defaultNick defaultHumbydefault: It is a very important part of our schools’ programme that we do train the teachers. It is not just about giving them the equipment, it is about helping them do that and following up and seeing how they are doing it. What we are seeing in the feedback we are getting, is over half those kits we delivered are delivering a seven to 12 week programme in those schools so it is a great introduction. For those girls who want to go on for a team 
defaultexperience then we have a very strong schools’ team programme and about 6,000 girls take part in the schools’ team competition. We offer the fun of it but also a competitive route if that is where they want to go.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ220 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default Do you think there is a problem with the perception among women that sport is about those that are good at it, particularly at school? If you demonstrate immediately that you have a knack for sport, you have a talent, that somehow you are the one that it is all about and for the rest, “Actually, it is not really for you” and there is a problem with that.
defaultEmma defaultPooleydefault: I think that is quite true. Getting picked last for the team if you are bad at a certain sport at school is quite a scarring experience for some kids. To be honest, I did not like netball because I was always picked last because I am short and could not throw the ball very well. But I found out that I really liked running. I would go off and do a run instead of playing netball and I think that that element of choice is quite good. Logistically, and in terms of cost, it would be very hard to offer a full choice of sports at every school but giving some element of choice to children so they can say, “Okay, well, I am unusual, I really do not like football. I am terrible at it but I quite like yoga” or something. I was at a school for sixth form that offered a choice of sport for the kids and there was no one that did not want to do something. It meant that you could perhaps choose a less competitive sport if you did not feel comfortable in a super competitive environment of netball or football. That would perhaps help reduce that feeling of, “I’m not good at it so why bother”.
defaultChris Boardmandefault: One of the barriers that we have seen is people’s comfort level on the roads and a lot of that is to do with training. There is a programme now, 
defaultBikeability
default, that replaces and far surpasses the old cycling proficiency test and it takes place on roads. It is not part of the curriculum. I personally think it should be. It should be a life skill, along with learning to swim. That has been hugely popular and it is growing quickly. It gives people the skills, trains them on the road. But schools have to go and sign up for that. It is readily available to them but they have to proactively go and seek it out. But I think that could go an awful long way certainly for our sport and, again, that bleeds into transport choices as well.
defaultNick defaultHumbydefault: Tennis can be seen as technically quite a hard sport to play on a full court with a normal ball. But what is great about the mini tennis programme, with the different compression balls, is that when you come into it 
defaultit
default is quite easy to play and have a fun experience at a rally early on and, therefore, it is less technically difficult to get into the sport. I think that is quite an important way of selling it, making it easier and accessible to the young children.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ221 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default I am quite interested in following up some of the questions that we have had around accessibility. I am conscious that perhaps there is not a whole wealth of netball pitches all over the place. For example, if you compare 
defaultEngland
default to 
defaultFrance
default we do not have the same community tennis courts. With cycling you have roads, but I am interested in accessibility to 
defaultvelodromes
default and other competitive venues. I wonder if you could perhaps say a bit about access to facilities to start off with.
defaultJoanna Adamsdefault: We have recently done a mapping exercise to map facilities in this country as against latent demand. There is a certain lack of facilities but we have worked very hard with a lot of the larger leisure providers to make sure that we are getting access to the courts. Again, coming back to our consumer research that suggests the times that women and girls want to 
defaultaccess those courts. So we have worked very hard with that. Facilities I think for all NGBs are a bugbear. Perhaps for us it is not as big as other topics that we would like to tackle, but I think working with the leisure providers has helped us a lot.
defaultOne area where we are looking to grow and to engage with facilities where we had not previous is where people are commercial providers and own a facility. We would never have embraced them previously and we have just signed a deal to start working with a commercial provider. Their customer base is predominantly male, so we are looking again at times when the guys do not actually want to play. We will then go in and provide netball at those facilities. So, yes, I think for us it is a concern but it is not one of our major concerns at this moment in time.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ222 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default It is interesting you say that because the Maidstone Netball Club is based at the Aylesford Rugby Club, so it is being used at a completely different time of the week than when the rugby club is being used as a facility for rugby.
defaultJoanna Adamsdefault: Our latest deal that we are just about to sign is to engage with a commercial provider for five-a-side football. So, although we cannot play our affiliated competitive leagues, the surface is fine for us to play leisure and also Back to Netball. On a Tuesday and Wednesday night when it is Champion’s League Football their facility is very quiet. Tuesday and Wednesday night is our perfect night and that is when our Back to Netballers desperately need facilities. So we are going to cross-promote that the guys stay at home, watch Champion’s League Football, get a bit of peace and quiet, send your wives off back to netball and the facility gets used.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ223 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default Perfect. What about tennis?
default 
defaultNick defaultHumbydefault: We have identified there is about a 21,000 court capacity, of which 7,000 are in the community sector and the rest are in commercial or private clubs. We have invested about £40 million over the last five or six years into 395 projects in order to improve facilities. Even then £40 million is still only a small proportion of the total funding, so it is a challenge for how you do that. We are in the process of researching and publishing early next year a new facility strategy to try to work out how we do meet this challenge of ensuring that facilities are up to scratch and used regularly. I think that is a very important part of our plans.
defaultWe have done a number of interesting things in the last few years. In 
defaultPortsmouth
default we have funded a new indoor centre there because the old facility had a low indoor capacity. The Mountbatten Leisure Centre is just opening now through funding from the LTA and Sport England. That is a way of creating new capacity there. Not only that but we will then engage with the local community and with local authorities to make sure that, once it is open, it is getting lots of activity there. It is not just about creating facilities it is about how you promote them and have the right operator or programme runner on it to make that work.
defaultWhen we open or when we invest, our challenge is to make sure that the people who run it thereafter, the partners who take responsibility for it, actively promote and use it. That is what we want to see in order to get more people playing.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ224 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default Just out of interest the tennis courts within school facilities, are they defined as private or community courts?
defaultNick defaultHumbydefault: These do not include school facilities. What we are doing with satellite clubs is trying to open up school facilities and working with Sport England funding to try to do that and take community clubs into school facilities. There are obviously certain barriers around that in terms of accessibility, but that is a new thing we have started to do this year. We would like to see more of that. That helps bridge from a school environment into a community environment out into the wider world.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ225 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default On cycling, Chris, you mentioned briefly earlier about the research among women and road cycle safety. You are very welcome to expand on that because I think that is incredibly interesting. Here in 
defaultLondon
default we are seeing issues around road cycle safety in particular, but I am also interested about access to 
defaultvelodromes
default and the race aspect of it.
defaultChris Boardmandefault: Yes. We have a facilities team and they work very hard to make sure that we have an equal spread across the country. We all know about 
defaultManchester
default of course that became the home of British cycling. But it was more than that, it also became the focal point for activities and now they have now expanded. They have an indoor BMX track there as well. Demand far outstrips capacity. We now just have the Taster session. The waiting time is months. The good thing about that is it gave other local authorities and other regions the confidence to go ahead. We now have 
defaultGlasgow
default, which is up and running now and that is fantastic. We have the 
defaultvelodrome
default in 
defaultDerby
default; we have had 
defaultNewport
default in 
defaultWales
default. We have those tracks there for people to use and they serve as focal points. 
defaultNewport
default is perhaps a better place than 
defaultManchester
default to just go straight out and ride a bike at the moment. But 
defaultManchester
default are working very hard on that. It has all been catalysed because of this facility.
default              
defaultWe also have closed road circuits that give people a chance to either go and race and train, perhaps gain confidence, without having to go on the road until they get confidence in themselves first. We are seeing those opening up all around the country. We have them in Torbay, Nottingham, 
defaultHull
default and Pendle. They are recent ones. I have one not far from my home on the Wirral peninsula. It was actually the site of an old tip that has been landscaped and now has a closed road circuit on it. We have a team dedicated to try to make that happen around the country.
defaultEmma defaultPooleydefault: I think those closed road circuits are absolutely key for children’s cycling. My coach also coaches lots of junior 
defaulttriathletes
default. It is very hard for him to take a group of kids out on to the road because it is just so dangerous and parents do not want them to go out and it is a big responsibility for him. A closed road circuit is the perfect place to teach children bike handling skills and things in a safe environment, so that you can then take them on to a road and they will be safer.
defaultChris Boardmandefault: I know safety has come up several times already. Unfortunately, I have to bang on about it because the single biggest barrier for us is the perception of safety. The fact that we have been talking about deaths recently; the fact that we are talking about them tells us something. An airplane crash makes all the news and so does a shark attack, when you are quite safe going in the sea and that is the safest mode of transport. It is when it stops making the news that we are in trouble. But the perception is that it is not safe. I certainly would not feel comfortable letting my children ride to the park, which is 
default500 metres
default from where we live, and that is an absolute tragedy. It obviously ties into health, environment and pretty much all Government Departments have an interest in seeing us change the way that we travel. Our 
defaultsport is part of a larger debate and that debate will affect how well we can do on the sporting side as well.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ226 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default What would you like to do to overcome these challenges?
defaultChris Boardmandefault: There is a paper available, the 
defaultGet Britain Cycling
default report, which was published earlier this year. Most of the recommendations are in there. It is only a 15-minute read. It is a very good document but it needs political will to act. We have lots of fantastic examples. People tend to point to Europe, the 
defaultNetherlands
default, 
defaultCopenhagen
default, all the places where we know about. But I think the best example that I have seen recently was 
defaultNew York
default because arguably they had an even less attractive environment than we have, and there was a conscious decision by the mayor at that level to say, “Right, we are going to change it”.
defaultThey had some great ideas. They knew that they were going to get challenged so they started with infrastructure. They said, “Okay, we are going to paint a line on the road and we are going to put planters in to separate the traffic out. It is not going to cost much and if you do not like it we can take it out”. That took the fear away from people and, “Okay, we will try that” and of course then they loved it. Since they started just a few years ago there has been a 250% increase in cycling. There are children cycling on the streets because it looks and feels safer because there is some separation. Their equivalent of our boroughs are now clamouring to get their cycling infrastructure. They have just done that since 2007, which is when I think they started. They have done an incredible job. So there are an awful lot of lessons that can be learned there.
defaultQ227 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default I was going to ask you about international comparisons, in terms of both grassroots and elite sport. Are there any examples that you can all give where you have seen other countries perhaps promote the girls’ and the women’s sport better? What is it that they are doing that perhaps we in the 
defaultUK
default could do more of or we could do it better? If we start with cycling.
defaultEmma defaultPooleydefault: At the grassroots I think British Cycling is doing a fantastic job. I am constantly frustrated by the elite level of the sport. It is not really British Cycling’s problem. It is just a function of the sport as a whole. There has just been an historical massive difference between the number of men’s races and men’s teams and things, so there is a big difference.
default              
defaultI know that some countries basically run a professional team out of the national team. British Cycling has done it in the past—the Halfords team was essentially set up by British Cycling. That was incredibly successful. That was basically built as a team to surround Nicole Cooke, to give her the backing to try to win the gold medal in 
defaultBeijing
default, which she did. So it ticked all the boxes and it was a successful professional team in its own right.
default              
defaultIt is very expensive to run a professional team. It is not as expensive as running a men’s team, because you do not have to pay the riders very much and the whole infrastructure is much smaller for a women’s team. But it is a big cost and I think it can be hard to justify that in terms of 
defaultUK
default sport funding. Where do you take the money from? You do not want to take it from grassroots programmes but it has to come from somewhere. So that is another thing about attracting sponsors to the sport, and with the media coverage you can bring in an outside sponsor. For example, Sky came in for the men’s team, which is linked to British Cycling, and the Sky men’s team has been incredibly successful and it does not have to take any money out of British Cycling’s budget. I am not speaking on behalf of British Cycling here, but personally that is the kind of thing I would like to see happen or just, yes, more opportunities for professional teams. But it is hard for British Cycling and I cannot claim that they should pay for all that.
defaultNick defaultHumbydefault: We are quite excited at the moment because, on 6 January, we have a new chief executive joining the LTA who currently runs Tennis 
defaultCanada
default. So we will have direct insight from another country. When we talk to him about what has made for success in 
defaultCanada
default, clearly they have had tremendous success in the Davis Cup. That is clearly the environment for raising the profile of tennis in 
defaultCanada
default and then they have used that to leverage growth in participation. I think he sees that opportunity here with the young players coming through, to leverage their profile and create more 
defaultaspirational
default role models to help us get more people playing. He is very keen for us to see that happening next year. I am looking forward to having that direct interaction with him about his experience in another major country, which has had great success in tennis, coming in and applying it to the 
defaultUK
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ228 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default Other than Laura Robson, we have not really had any very high-profile female tennis players, say, over the last decade. But, for example, 
defaultAmerica
default has, Eastern European countries have. What are they doing? What are they investing in 
defaultin
default their facilities that we are not doing?
defaultNick defaultHumbydefault: As well as Laura, who is obviously an outstanding prospect, we have Heather Watson—she did very well last year but has not been so successful this year—and Johanna 
defaultKonta
default is now our number two. They are the bones of our Fed Cup team.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ229 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default It has been a long time coming.
defaultNick defaultHumbydefault: It is a long process. The pathway for young people to come through, starting at eight right through to 23 or 24 when they break in, is a long pathway. It is not something we can change overnight, and I think what we are seeing is the start of the work that has been done since 2007, 2008 and 2009. It is starting to come through at the lower levels. We still have a gap. We still have to get that pathway working better and get more people through. But we are working hard to support them.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ230 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default Is that tail getting thicker now? Are there people of 12, 13 and 14 coming through?
defaultNick defaultHumbydefault: At the lowest levels, yes. It is not going to transform overnight. It will take time and it is a long-term process. The success of Andy and hopefully the success of Laura, Heather and Johanna, and the Fed Cup and the Davis Cup, will inspire more to keep going on that pathway along which we are supporting them on that long journey through to, hopefully, breaking into the tour level.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ231 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default And netball, 
defaultAustralia
default is the—
defaultJoanna Adamdefault: I was going to say, yes—as everybody knows—we look to the model of 
defaultAustralia
default and 
defaultNew Zealand
default. Quite interestingly, they have contacted us to ask how we have grown our grassroots. If you look at it from an elite point of view then obviously we aspire to be 
defaultAustralia
default and 
defaultNew Zealand
default. A huge amount of money goes into their professional programme from TV money, so it is funded far more heavily than we are. Also I think there is a culture in that country of female sport. The climate helps a huge amount. But from driving participation they are now coming back and asking us how we are doing it.
default              
defaultAt an elite level we absolutely look to them but they are professional athletes. We are non-professional athletes playing professional athletes. They have requested that five or six of our girls go over there and play now, and you do see that they come back as very different athletes when they have been over there.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ232 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default A final question. We touched on role models earlier. We talked about some glamour and everything else. Nick, I wonder how you felt about John 
defaultInverdale’s
default comments earlier on in the season at the end of 
defaultWimbledon
default. How much did that push back women’s tennis in terms of progression?
defaultNick defaultHumbydefault: I think he probably regretted them afterwards, so it was unfortunate. The image of women is very important in promoting the sport and I think we do have some great role models who do exactly that. They are great athletes and they are playing great tennis and the audiences are watching that in large numbers on TV. That is our opportunity to convert that into more people playing more often.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ233 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Sutcliffe:default One of the criticisms of sport is that there are not enough women in senior managerial positions or on the executives of many sports. What are you doing to redress that balance? I am not sure what the equivalent is in netball but—
defaultJoanna Adamdefault: We are redressing it the other way. We want guys on our board.
defaultMr Sutcliffe:default—just tell us a little bit about what each of you are doing
defaultin respect of that.
defaultNick defaultHumbydefault: Shall I go first this time?
default              
defaultMr Sutcliffe:default Yes.
defaultNick defaultHumbydefault: We are a five person exec team at the moment and two of those are women, so 40% of our exec team are female. We have 10 non-executive positions on our board, two of those are female. We are very proud that as of tomorrow we will have our first woman president, Cathie Sabin, and I think that is a really important role model.
defaultSix of our 10 positions on our board come out of council. In our council, which has just been reformatted for next year, there are 28% of women on it. One of the things we have been doing over the last 18 months—Cathie Sabin and our head of legal ran this programme—was identifying what are the barriers for women who have reached council putting themselves forward for committees and membership of boards, and there were some reservations. We have been running training for them. So we have been running programmes about how to chair meetings, how to present information, and finance for non-finance managers. We have been trying to up-skill those people so that they have the confidence to put themselves forward. I am sure with Cathie leading the LTA as president over the next three years we will see more people putting themselves forward in a senior way.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ234 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Sutcliffe:default Cycling, Chris?
defaultChris Boardmandefault: We inherited a sport that has four times as many men as women, and I think we have to hold our hands up; we are well behind other sports. There is a significant gender imbalance on our board. Just recently our national council has voted through some 
defaultsignificant changes that will allow us to address that. We aim to have 25% of women make up the board by 2017. So we have to hold our hands up for that one.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ235 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Sutcliffe:default Joanna, what is happening with netball?
defaultJoanna Adamdefault: We are a predominantly female board. However, our CEO is male. I suppose we look for the best people for the job. There are some gentlemen who have joined our board and I think that does give it a nicer mix. You can imagine in netball throughout our entire structure it is predominantly women. It is not an issue that raises its head with us.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ236 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Sutcliffe:default The only other thing I want to ask about netball is how often do you refresh the plan? Obviously I was heavily involved when you launched it but how often do you look at it and say, “Are things going okay now”?
defaultJoanna Adamdefault: Our whole sport plan took us about a year and a half to write it, the plan that went into Sport England for the current four year funding. We started with that funding around April time this year. I was at the development conference yesterday. We had our 110 delivery staff there and we talked through what those plans are for next year. A lot of that was around the fact that that was the plan. It was set around two years ago, realistically. It is going to naturally evolve and some of the things that we thought were right, because our insight is continual, actually it is not quite right. The plan will still deliver what we have promised to deliver but the journey along the way we will make tweaks within that definitely, yes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ237 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Sutcliffe:default Nick, you alluded to earlier that you are looking forward to the start of the new chief exec. You know there have been some criticisms, not least from in here, about the role of tennis and the ability for the players to come through the pathways and I accept the point that it takes a long time. There was also an issue about young, elite players being creamed off and then sent off to 
defaultRoehampton
default, or wherever else, and yet the rest of the sport was left behind. Through the Foundation and the like things are now changing, but would you like to say a little bit more about whether you recognise some of the problems that were around?
defaultNick defaultHumbydefault: That is certainly the perception that still exists, but the talent pathway for elite players is through decentralised performance centres local to where people live. Although we have partially funded and given advice on how to run those, these are independent organisations that run them. There is a pathway now from high performance centres to international high performance centres, but they are regionally based and that is a very important part of it. So it is a decentralised structure with guidance and funding from us about the sort of balance between strength conditioning, technical training, nutrition and all those things, and we can help those places. But that is the pathway, and we will reward and measure them on how successful they are in generating the players. I think that is the model that we are committed to in the long-term. It is a long-term game to see how that works.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ238 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Sutcliffe:default I was not just thinking about the elite, although I am grateful for the explanation. From what I am seeing more of tennis is it is getting back out into the communities more than it ever did before, in terms that some of the clubs were seen to be elitist and people were not able to into clubs because of the nature of that.
defaultNick defaultHumbydefault: I think that is changing as well. As we identify local authorities and break in to local authorities to get more activity on their courts, we will find a local partner who is best to 
defaultdo that. A very good example is Edgbaston. Edgbaston was perceived as a very elitist club, and when we invested in Edgbaston to create the new centre court for the Classic event this year they also were encouraged—and have embraced—the idea of community access. They now reach out into surrounding schools and park sites and run programmes, and they have really changed their perception. It is very interesting to see how that can happen.
default              
defaultAnother club, like West Hants in Bournemouth that is a very successful members club, has now taken on from Bournemouth Council three of the park sites and oversees and runs them in order to support tennis in that environment. Obviously in the longer term they might progress to the club, but most of them will just stay on a park site and play and that is very good for that community. So more of that needs to happen.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ239 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Sutcliffe:default Chris, cycling in the sense that I can remember cycling clubs in the Leeds and 
defaultBedford
default area that have always been there. You are right about cycling reinventing itself a few years ago. What are you doing to look to the future in terms of making sure you keep ahead of the game, making sure that there are more people coming through?
defaultChris Boardmandefault: I was on the senior management team for nearly 10 years. I am not in that position now, but as I am aware it has not changed a great deal. It is constantly reviewed all the time. But it was fundamentally two things. First of all they tried an athlete-centred approach, “What does this person need to perform?” That did not work. Then they went to a performance-centred approach. They did not look at the history of an event; they looked at the demands of the event and broke it down. So everything was referenced back to the one goal of, “Yes, is this the best way to get a gold medal?” Whatever activity, attitude or behaviour, whatever it might be was always referenced back to that.
default              
defaultI think one of the biggest things that made a big difference for me is that they centralised the squad. So once you got a gold medal winner there was the yardstick constantly there, and it was not comfortable and it is not fun, but for that individual to get them to want to be there it was the responsibility of the British Cycling team to make them want to be here. So I believe pay structures were brokered, how it was structured with UK Sport. It is not just about money, but when you wanted to retain the good person who could go somewhere else then we paid them the rate to stay. So people wanted to be there. Then when you had a gold medallist other athletes trained and measured themselves on a daily basis against the best in the world. Then the adage of “success breeds success” came from there. That became the normal way of doing practice. Then they would go out into the professional world, into the teams that we see, Tour de France and the like, but they still had a link back to this central base. It is not a comfortable place to be and there is often squabbling, but fundamentally you were always measuring yourself against the best possible yardstick and that worked well for cycling. They have a good infrastructure below. They have good relationships with clubs, but to start that the catalyst to get elite performance was to have them in one place.
defaultChair:default That is all the questions we have. Thank you very much.
