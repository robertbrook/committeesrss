"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Suffolk Coastal District Council (SRN 031)\nHow does the Government’s policy for roads link with planning for other transport modes?\nThe evidence from the recent process in \nregard to the planning for the A14\n toll road\n in \nCamb\nridge\nshire\n indicates that the HA has taken no accoun\nt whatsoever of the s\ntrategic relevance or impact of this major scheme, relating it to and presenting it solely as a local congestion relief scheme for \nthe Cambridge and Huntingdon area. As evidence of the Government’s policy in action, it is appears to indicate that the policy environment is not fit for purpose. \nThis is not inconsistent with previous episodes in rel\na\ntion to the HA and other issues on th\ne A14. \nExamples are the difficul\nties some 6 or 7\n years ago in rela\ntion to ‘Operation Stack’, the process to ac\nc\no\nmmodat\ne HGVs and reduce \ncongestion\n on the A14 in \nthe\n event of closure of \nFelixstowe\n \nPort.\n The HA’s approach was \nexceedingly\n \nineffective\n in \nrelation\n \nto\n the feasibility of various options, \nespecially\n in respect to the \nimpact\n on local \nroads\n and communities. A workable solution was eventually found, almost \nentirely\n from the \ninput\n and efforts of Suffolk \nCounty\n Council, Suffolk Coastal \nDistrict\n Cou\nncil, the \nPort\n of \nFelixstowe\n and the police. \nGovernment\n policy, as \nevidenced\n by the HA’s \napproach\n \nappeared\n to be based on the concept of the Trunk Road being a separate and standalone entity,  unrelated to local circumstances. \nSimilar considerations appli\ned to the design of improvement at Dock Spur Roundabout \nFelixstowe\n and the \nCopdock\n Interchange. \nThe designs in \nthose\n cases, while \nperforming\n excellently in their core role, were not permitted to take into account possible related \nimprovements\n on the immedi\nately \nadjoining\n roads.\nOther examples could be quoted, but these are sufficient to indicate that there needs to be a fundamental rethink of the approach to integrating policy and opportunities on the trunk and local road systems\nHow should the Highways Age\nncy be reformed to make it “the world’s leading highway operator”? What roles should Government and the private sector play to ensure better management of the strategic road network?\nThe HA appears to operate in total isolation from all other local agencie\ns, let alone communities. Many other \ngovernment\n agencies, \nfor example, The\n \nEnvironment\n \nA\ngency and Natural England, \nand\n many others\n,\n have moved an \nenormous distan\nce over r\necent years in correcting previ\nous\nl\ny similar, although none as \nextreme\n, stances. \nThe \nHA howe\nver seems impervious to such evolutions. \nThe HA also appears to have no concept whatsoever of cost-effectiveness. \nThe design standar\nds f\nor\n trunk roads such as the A14 have over the past decade \nbecome more and more stringent and grandiose, \nmeaning\n t\nhat schemes conceived for example a decade ago, become hugely more expensive, or indeed unaffordable, when reworked “to modern standards”. What the country needs are many new or updated roads, implemented in a much more modest and cost-effective way, so al\nlowing many more schemes to be actually implemented, and hence greatly improving the collective ‘return on investment’ for the government (or indeed other funding sources).\nAn example of this was the implementation of the long and desperately needed \nimprov\nement\n at \nHaughl\ne\ny\n, on the A14 near \nStowmarket\n. The new interchange built there, for a minor \nlocal\n \nroad\n, was of a \nstandard\n which would do justice to a full motorway junction at a major \ninterchange\n for a \nb\ni\ng\n city. The land take alone was \nextrav\naga\nnt\n in compa\nrison to the \noriginal\n, entirely \nsatisfactory\n,\n \ninterchanges\n dating fro\nm\n the A14’s \noriginal\n \nconstruction\n in the 1980\ns. \nThe HA’s \nproject\n \nmanagement\n has certainly never impressed with its apparent cost-effectiveness. The \ninstallation\n of the overhead sign system along the A14 \nwas\n \nmost\n \nwelcome\n. B\nu\nt the time taken (\naround\n two years) was hard to understand. Indeed, after many months of construction of the ducting \netc\n, and the \nsigns\n \nthemselves\n, they stood \nunused\n for \napproaching\n a year befo\nre being commissioned and coming into use. \nAlso, when it was suggested to the HA, that, if it was necessary to construct the data and power ducts for the length of the A14, there could be an opportunity to offer capacity in those ducts to telecoms provider\ns or others, \nand procure thereby an income stream, \nthe suggestion appeared to shock the HA representative as being utterly inappropriate. \nThe HA \nshould\n, be required to \noperate with the same degree of cost effectiveness and efficiency\n that has been force\nd o\nn Local Authorities and other government departments.\nSimilarly, it should be required to undertake a fundamental revision of its policy and approach in relation to local agencies and communities – the concept know\nn\n elsewhere as ‘localism’. Again the recen\nt process\n i\nn respect of the A14 toll road has illustrated how out of touch it is – to the point where place names on the consultation leaflet are actually incorrect. \n(\nBrampton\n shown as Ellington, in addition to the real Ellington on the other side of the A\n1).\nDfT\n Circular 02/2013: THE STRATEGIC ROAD NETWORK AND THE DELIVERY OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT states: Operating an effective and efficient strategic road network makes a significant contribution to the delivery of sustainable economic growth, helping to cre\nate the conditions that support the realisation of the aspirations of businesses and communities, and is a key deliverable for the Highways Agency in meeting its remit of delivery partner to national economic growth. \nThe recent A14 proposals are completel\ny contrary to this statement. We have major concerns about the way the consultation was presented \nas well\n the possible consequences of the \ntolling \nproposals. The consultation is presented as a local congestion issue in Cambridge / Huntingdon and this view is clearly evidenced by the exhibitions all being local to that area. The regional, let alone national, aspects are mentioned only in passing and t\nhe so-called \"Alternative Routes\" are only remotely relevant or practical for local traffic, and only light vehicles. We therefore challenged the consultation and proposals at the most fundamental level. \nIn summary, the HA should undergo a fundamental rev\niew of its role, structure \nand governance to bring it into line with current standards and policies.\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
