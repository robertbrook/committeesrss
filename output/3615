[normal]Written evidence from 
[normal]Dr Paul Harlow
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Summary[bold]No full and thorough contingent valuation has been made of the damage that HS2 will cause to the Chilterns 
[normal]AONB. Such a financial valuation should be made under best practice in order to make an appraisal of the scheme.
[normal]In light of the State of Nature Report we now know that all significant areas of ecological and environmental significance must now be viewed a
[normal]s being of National Significance. The Chilterns AONB as an intact and well-preserved, protected landmass near its’ 
[normal]Metropoleis
[normal] London and Birmingham deserves careful stewardship and the swift removal by Parliament of the risk that HS2 poses to it.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]HS2 Ltd[bold] has avoided any proper consideration of the monetary valuation of the Chiltern AONB as a whole and to its commercial/ tourist value (being one of the most visited Landscapes in Europe). This failure is largely as the issue represents one of the most perni[bold]cious aspects of the scheme alongside proper compensation of the victims of HS2 and regional economic winners and losers.[bold]KPMG’s report did not address the first two factors and barely hinted at the third (by the use of unexplained illustration, the matter[bold] was clarified under FOI).[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The committee needs to ensure that proper financial valuations have been made and factored into the business case.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]At present Transport projects are currently appraised using detailed guidance produced by the Department for Tra
[normal]nsport (
[normal]DfT
[normal]). This approach uses the environmental capital approach, which describes sequentially the characteristic environmental features being appraised. 
[normal]HS2 ltd have taken a component rather than a whole approach to the AONB which I believe suits thei
[normal]r purpose and business plan whilst effectively devaluing a National Asset that the Government is legally bound to protect.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]HS2 ltd promulgates a fiction that HS2 will not be damaging to the AONB (and draw false parallels to HS1 which used manor transport 
[normal]corridors). The Chiltern AONB Board and many environmental groups contest HS2 LTD view as to damage.
[normal]The cost of following the M40 corridor was rejected on the basis of cost of tunnels
[normal](3Bn) to mitigate populations. The cost of mitigating tunnels (for engi
[normal]neering reasons / cost cutting (HS2 ltd)) in route 3 has already exceeded this amount
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The committee may want to consider the following guidance taken from the European Landscape Convention to which the UK is a signatory and appraise this.
[normal](I have bold it
[normal]alicized the pertinent aspects).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Landscape is about the relationship between people and place. It provides the setting for our day-to-day lives. The term does not mean just special or designated landscapes and it does not only apply to the countryside. La
[normal]ndscape can mean a small patch of urban wasteland as much as a mountain range and an urban park as much as an expanse of lowland plain. It results from the way that different components of our environment - both natural (the influences of geology, soils, c
[normal]limate, flora and fauna) and cultural (the historical and current impact of land use, settlement, enclosure and 
[normal]other human interventions) - interact together and are perceived by us.
[normal]The European landscape convention defines landscape as an „area, as perc
[normal]eived by people, whose character is the result of the action and interaction of natural and/or human factors. Landscape can be defined as “an expanse of scenery and objects which can be seen in a single view”. Landscape and townscape includes the look and 
[normal]form of buildings and includes heritage assets, for example, ancient field patterns and the layout of towns. 
[normal]This document helps consideration of whether your policy may have significant impacts on the landscape or townscape. These effects could be direct
[normal] or indirect. You need to identify policy impacts, quantification of the impacts and finally 
[normal]monetisation
[normal] those impacts where possible. You should also be aware of existing controls and restrictions on changes to the landscape and townscape. 
[normal]The paper is divided into seven sections 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1. Landscape as an ecosystem service 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. Existing controls and restrictions on changes to the landscape and townscape 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. Does the policy impact on landscape? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. Is the impact significant? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. Identification 
[normal]of the impact 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6. Quantification [bold]&#xa0;[bold]7. [bold]Monetisation[bold] [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The E.L.C. advises
[normal]The first question to consider is whether your policy will have an impact on landscape. 
[normal]You should consider if your policy will: [bold]&#xa0;[bold]· Lead to a change in land-use or farming practices [bold]&#xa0;[bold]· Lead to visually intrusive development [bold]&#xa0;[bold]· Lead to significant land-take (use of land for development) [bold]&#xa0;[bold]· Lead to the demolition or dereliction of notable buildings [bold]&#xa0;[bold]· Lead to the loss of local character [bold]&#xa0;[bold]· Adversely affect land in any National Park, Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty or in their setting [bold]&#xa0;[bold]If your policy will have an impact on landscape the second question is whether that impact will be significant.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]To judge whether the impacts will be significant[bold]3 [bold]you should include in your considerations the value which people place on the landscapes which will be changed (or created) by the policy option. [bold]3 [bold]Refer to Guidelines for landscape and visual impacts asse[bold]ssment (2002) by landscape institute and the institute of environmental management and assessment for technical definition of significance [bold]As the European Landscape Convention definition identifies, the importance of a landscape depends on the attachment that people feel to that landscape. This attachment can be thought of as the value that people place on the benefits and services which they[bold] obtain from the landscape or townscape. For example, people may go to walk in a particular area to find enjoyment of a special view, or get the feeling of relative tranquility. [bold]To judge if decide whether the impact is significant, consider: [bold]&#xa0;[bold]· Is the ch[bold]aracter of the landscape or townscape affected [bold]&#xa0;[bold]· What characteristics of the landscape or townscape are affected [bold]&#xa0;[bold]· The extent of landscape affected [bold]&#xa0;[bold]· The sensitivity of the receptor [bold]&#xa0;[bold]· The magnitude of the impact [bold]&#xa0;[bold]· The benefits and services that p[bold]eople gain from the landscape [bold]&#xa0;[bold]· How important these benefits and services are and how strongly people value them [bold]&#xa0;[bold]· How many people value the benefits [bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Whether there are alternative sources for the same benefits [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6. Quantification [bold]The next step in appraising the landscape and visual impacts of your policy is to quantify the impacts you have identified. Guidance of the quantification of impacts can be found from a number of sources (see below). [bold]When considering how to quantify the i[bold]mpacts of your policy consideration should be given as to whether to take whole or component approach to assessing landscape impacts. Landscapes are made up of many features and the value of a whole landscape may be greater than the sum of the value of its[bold] components. There are strong arguments for always taking a whole landscape approach as it is a more accurate reflection of how individuals view and value landscapes, however the choice between the whole landscape or component approach may depend on the po[bold]licy you are trying to assess and the valuation information you have available – see section on [bold]Monetisation[bold] challenges[bold]6[bold].

[normal]Dear Sir
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am writing to inquire whether the department has been approached in respect of 
[normal]Contigent
[normal] Valuations in relation to the potential damage and loss of landscape based economy in the Chilterns AONB
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]consequential to the 
[normal]build and operational 
[normal]phase of HS2 and also whether this valuation has been made in terms of the short term and long term impact?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I would ask that you also answer whether any
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]appraisal has been made of 
[normal]contigent
[normal] valuation has been made to the whole landscape as opposed to com
[normal]ponent based appraisals?
[normal]The DES issued in the Autumn by HS2 took a 
[normal]compenent
[normal] based approach which misrepresented the
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]true nature of the damage that would occur to the AONB as
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a whole.
[normal]As the Chiltern AONB is legally protected by HM Government do the HS2
[normal] proposals and the grave concerns of the Chiltern Board meet the criteria ' of the 
[normal]The
[normal] European Landscape Convention?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Please answer these two points in addition
[normal]1)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Has HS2 ltd requested assistance with the preparation of a 
[normal]contigent
[normal] valuation in respect 
[normal]to the chosen (route 3) plan which traverses the Chilterns AONB and if so are they using a component or whole landscape approach?
[normal]2) Did KPMG ask for assistance with the production of a 
[normal]contigent
[normal] valuation for the impact of HS2 in the Chiltern region. Thei
[normal]r report has no reference to the monetary impact of HS2 on the Chiltern
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]AONB economy despite this being one of the most accessed piece of European landscape on one that supports a major tourism industry?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]My final inquiry.
[normal]Has the department 
[normal]analysed
[normal] and 
[normal]independently assessed the sound maps that have been provided by HS2 ltd in terms of noise pollution?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am preparing a report potentially to be submitted to a PC and would value a prompt response please .
