defaultWritten evidence from 
defaultDr Paul Harlow
default&#xa0;
defaultSummarydefaultNo full and thorough contingent valuation has been made of the damage that HS2 will cause to the Chilterns 
defaultAONB. Such a financial valuation should be made under best practice in order to make an appraisal of the scheme.
defaultIn light of the State of Nature Report we now know that all significant areas of ecological and environmental significance must now be viewed a
defaults being of National Significance. The Chilterns AONB as an intact and well-preserved, protected landmass near its’ 
defaultMetropoleis
default London and Birmingham deserves careful stewardship and the swift removal by Parliament of the risk that HS2 poses to it.
default&#xa0;
defaultHS2 Ltddefault has avoided any proper consideration of the monetary valuation of the Chiltern AONB as a whole and to its commercial/ tourist value (being one of the most visited Landscapes in Europe). This failure is largely as the issue represents one of the most pernidefaultcious aspects of the scheme alongside proper compensation of the victims of HS2 and regional economic winners and losers.defaultKPMG’s report did not address the first two factors and barely hinted at the third (by the use of unexplained illustration, the matterdefault was clarified under FOI).default&#xa0;defaultThe committee needs to ensure that proper financial valuations have been made and factored into the business case.default&#xa0;
defaultAt present Transport projects are currently appraised using detailed guidance produced by the Department for Tra
defaultnsport (
defaultDfT
default). This approach uses the environmental capital approach, which describes sequentially the characteristic environmental features being appraised. 
defaultHS2 ltd have taken a component rather than a whole approach to the AONB which I believe suits thei
defaultr purpose and business plan whilst effectively devaluing a National Asset that the Government is legally bound to protect.
default&#xa0;
defaultHS2 ltd promulgates a fiction that HS2 will not be damaging to the AONB (and draw false parallels to HS1 which used manor transport 
defaultcorridors). The Chiltern AONB Board and many environmental groups contest HS2 LTD view as to damage.
defaultThe cost of following the M40 corridor was rejected on the basis of cost of tunnels
default(3Bn) to mitigate populations. The cost of mitigating tunnels (for engi
defaultneering reasons / cost cutting (HS2 ltd)) in route 3 has already exceeded this amount
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultThe committee may want to consider the following guidance taken from the European Landscape Convention to which the UK is a signatory and appraise this.
default(I have bold it
defaultalicized the pertinent aspects).
default&#xa0;
defaultLandscape is about the relationship between people and place. It provides the setting for our day-to-day lives. The term does not mean just special or designated landscapes and it does not only apply to the countryside. La
defaultndscape can mean a small patch of urban wasteland as much as a mountain range and an urban park as much as an expanse of lowland plain. It results from the way that different components of our environment - both natural (the influences of geology, soils, c
defaultlimate, flora and fauna) and cultural (the historical and current impact of land use, settlement, enclosure and 
defaultother human interventions) - interact together and are perceived by us.
defaultThe European landscape convention defines landscape as an „area, as perc
defaulteived by people, whose character is the result of the action and interaction of natural and/or human factors. Landscape can be defined as “an expanse of scenery and objects which can be seen in a single view”. Landscape and townscape includes the look and 
defaultform of buildings and includes heritage assets, for example, ancient field patterns and the layout of towns. 
defaultThis document helps consideration of whether your policy may have significant impacts on the landscape or townscape. These effects could be direct
default or indirect. You need to identify policy impacts, quantification of the impacts and finally 
defaultmonetisation
default those impacts where possible. You should also be aware of existing controls and restrictions on changes to the landscape and townscape. 
defaultThe paper is divided into seven sections 
default&#xa0;
default1. Landscape as an ecosystem service 
default&#xa0;
default2. Existing controls and restrictions on changes to the landscape and townscape 
default&#xa0;
default3. Does the policy impact on landscape? 
default&#xa0;
default4. Is the impact significant? 
default&#xa0;
default5. Identification 
defaultof the impact 
default&#xa0;
default6. Quantification default&#xa0;default7. defaultMonetisationdefault default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe E.L.C. advises
defaultThe first question to consider is whether your policy will have an impact on landscape. 
defaultYou should consider if your policy will: default&#xa0;default· Lead to a change in land-use or farming practices default&#xa0;default· Lead to visually intrusive development default&#xa0;default· Lead to significant land-take (use of land for development) default&#xa0;default· Lead to the demolition or dereliction of notable buildings default&#xa0;default· Lead to the loss of local character default&#xa0;default· Adversely affect land in any National Park, Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty or in their setting default&#xa0;defaultIf your policy will have an impact on landscape the second question is whether that impact will be significant.default&#xa0;defaultTo judge whether the impacts will be significantdefault3 defaultyou should include in your considerations the value which people place on the landscapes which will be changed (or created) by the policy option. default3 defaultRefer to Guidelines for landscape and visual impacts assedefaultssment (2002) by landscape institute and the institute of environmental management and assessment for technical definition of significance defaultAs the European Landscape Convention definition identifies, the importance of a landscape depends on the attachment that people feel to that landscape. This attachment can be thought of as the value that people place on the benefits and services which theydefault obtain from the landscape or townscape. For example, people may go to walk in a particular area to find enjoyment of a special view, or get the feeling of relative tranquility. defaultTo judge if decide whether the impact is significant, consider: default&#xa0;default· Is the chdefaultaracter of the landscape or townscape affected default&#xa0;default· What characteristics of the landscape or townscape are affected default&#xa0;default· The extent of landscape affected default&#xa0;default· The sensitivity of the receptor default&#xa0;default· The magnitude of the impact default&#xa0;default· The benefits and services that pdefaulteople gain from the landscape default&#xa0;default· How important these benefits and services are and how strongly people value them default&#xa0;default· How many people value the benefits default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultWhether there are alternative sources for the same benefits default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default6. Quantification defaultThe next step in appraising the landscape and visual impacts of your policy is to quantify the impacts you have identified. Guidance of the quantification of impacts can be found from a number of sources (see below). defaultWhen considering how to quantify the idefaultmpacts of your policy consideration should be given as to whether to take whole or component approach to assessing landscape impacts. Landscapes are made up of many features and the value of a whole landscape may be greater than the sum of the value of itsdefault components. There are strong arguments for always taking a whole landscape approach as it is a more accurate reflection of how individuals view and value landscapes, however the choice between the whole landscape or component approach may depend on the podefaultlicy you are trying to assess and the valuation information you have available – see section on defaultMonetisationdefault challengesdefault6default. default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;
defaultI would ask that you also answer whether any

defaultappraisal has been made of

defaultThe DES issued in the Autumn by HS2 took a

defaultAs the Chiltern AONB is legally protected by HM Government do the HS2
default proposals and the grave concerns of the Chiltern Board meet the criteria ' of the

default&#xa0;
defaultPlease answer these two points in addition

defaultHas HS2 ltd requested assistance with the preparation of a

defaultto the chosen (route 3) plan which traverses the Chilterns AONB and if so are they using a component or whole landscape approach?
default2) Did KPMG ask for assistance with the production of a
