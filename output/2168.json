"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by England Golf [WAS008]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n1.1\n              \nThe English Golf Union merged with the English Women's Golf Association on 1st January 2012 to form England Golf, the govern\ning body for all amateur golf in England.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n              \nEngland Golf is one of the largest sports governing bodies in England looking after the interests of over 1,900 golf clubs and 770,000 men and women club members.\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n              \nResponsible for the training of the count\nry’s top amateur golfers, England Golf also organises all the major English amateur championships. England Golf works to actively encourage new golfers and increase the continued interest and participation in golf through its golf de\nvelopment initiative ‘G\net into g\nolf’.\n  \nEngland Golf also maintains a uniform system of handicapping, administering and applying the Rules approved by the Council of National Golf Unions.\n&#xa0;\n1.\n4\n              \nEngland Golf is currently consulting with its stakeholders on developing a strategic pl\nan 2014 to 2017 and it is expected that the development of women and girls golf will be a key theme that emerges from this process.\n&#xa0;\n1.\n5\n              \nEngland Golf is a member of t\nhe England Golf Partnership (EGP) together with the PGA and supported by the Golf Foundati\non\n and Sport England.  The\n Whole Sport Plan \n(WSP) \nfor golf identifies how England will achieve its vision of becoming ‘The Leading Golf Nation in the World by 2020’ from grass root\ns right through to elite level.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1\n              \nAccording to the Sport England Active People Survey (June 2013), 105,100 females play golf once a week and 151,400 on a monthly basis; between 12% and 14% of the total participants within golf.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nIn terms of affiliated membership\n (2012 figures)\n, the\nre are \n107,037\n females who are members of an affiliated golf club in England.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n              \nGrass roots development programmes that are delivered through the network of County Golf Partner\nships (CGPs) attracted over 86,\n764 participants into golf between April 2012 \nand March 2013\n; \nthe proportion of female participants was 44% which exceeds the current profile of all participants within golf.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n              \nThere are currently 1,944 golf clubs affiliated to England Golf (September 2013)\n with the majority providing playing\n, coaching\n and membership opportunities for both females and males.  There are approximately 22 affiliated golf clubs where membership is on\nly open to wome\nn (by comparison there are \n4 golf clubs where membership is \nonly \nopen to men).\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nEngland Golf has an accreditation scheme called GolfMark (incorporating Sport England Clubmark) that identifies beginner and junior friendly facilities.  The\nre are currently 650 a\nf\nfiliated golf clubs in possession of this award and a further 450 working towards \nobtaining it.  The criteria for a club to obtain \nGolfMark is split into\n four main areas, all of which assess \non the basis of \nopportunities for \nwomen an\nd girls and men and boy\ns\n.  GolfMark facilities become focus clubs within a county to work in partnership with and for potential investment to help drive participation and membership through women’\ns specific \nand/or family sessions for example.  See \nwww.golfmark.org\n for more detail.\n  \n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nAt elite level,\n England Golf provides \n6\n \nwomen’s \nnational \nchampionships \nand \n3\n girl\n’\ns \nnational \nchampionships\n \nand the number of participants within these events totals \n1,024\n participants\n (compared to the equivalent events\n for males which totals 1,248\n participants\n)\n.  Below \nnational\n level, there are many competitive opportunities for women and gi\nrls at \ncounty and club level.\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n              \nFrom an elite coaching perspective, England Golf\n has squads \nfor both\n \nwomen and girls\n.  In total there are \n10 women and 7 girls in the national performance squad\ns\n that utilise \n5\n different training facilities and also warm weather training.  T\nhere are also co\naching opportunities at an earlier\n stage of the\n talent pathway\n, which \nin addi\ntion to 35 county coaching squads\n,\n \nthere are \n10\n \nregional \nperformance \nsquads (consisting of a maximum of \n8 players per region).\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPlease note,\n \nEngland Golf \nonly \nrun\n \nevents \nfor amateur golfers \nand therefore there is no prize money available\n at these events\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlthough we do not have specific statistics on \nmedia coverage\n, England Golf delivers specific content for female participants through \na variety of media, including \nw\neb, social\n, magazine, \ne-newsletter\ns\n and the \n‘\nGet into golf\n’\n marketing campaign\n (see also paragraph 6.6)\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.1\n              \nThe opportunity to \nincrease the number of women and girls p\narticipating within golf is \npotentially \na \nsignificant\n \ngrowth \narea and England Golf believes that this can be achieved by delivering nationally co-ordinated programmes focusing on recreational, social and family aspects, whilst ensuring that there are acces\nsible and affordable exit routes into golf club membership for those participants that wish to sustain their engagement with the sport.\n&#xa0;\n6.2\n              \nEngland Golf has previously conducted research into the barriers and motivations of market segments playing golf an\nd thi\ns has provided valuable insight\n.  \nWhilst across all segments\n \nthe main barriers highlighted were time, cost and perception; within the female segments the \nemphasis\n was more \nabout\n not knowing what opportunities were available to them and how golf can better communicate and market the sport.\n&#xa0;\n6.3\n              \nThe research highlights the importance that England Golf places on understanding the requirements of female segments and the ability to ac\nt upon the findings.\n  In addition to implementing a specific women’s \nmarketing \ncampaign, \nCounty Golf Partnerships now focus on delivering \ngroup taster and structured sessions for similar abilities\n at\n \ntargeted facilities that are \nfriendly, accessible and af\nfordable\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n6.4\n              \nMany women and girls view golf as male dom\ninated and feel self-conscious; \nwomen only groups are an ideal way to learn and support each other, it is also important that \nparticipants experience playing the game from the earliest opportunity (\nas opposed to just \nreceiving \ncoaching sessions).\n&#xa0;\n6.\n5\n              \nBased on examples of best practice and in particular an extremely successful women’s programme called ‘Here come the girls’ run at Fynn Valley Golf Club in Suffolk, the following factors are vital:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.\n6\n              \nThe \nnational \n‘\nGet into golf\n’ marketing campaign (\ns\nee \nwww.getintogolf.org\n)\n \nprovides information for new golfers and returners to experience a variety \nof \nopportunities.  The campaign \nengages\n with different organisations to target groups of women, including \nnetworks such as the Women\n’\ns Institute (WI) and \nMums in the Know; \nworking \nwith other sports \nfor example\n British Cycling’s\n Cycletta\n events; \nonline \nmagazines including\n \nwww.sportsister.com\n and the NHS.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7.1\n              \nEngla\nnd Golf works\n closely with the Golf Foundation \n(a charity committed to the sporting and social development of young people through golf) \nthrough the\n England Golf Partnership \nto provide opportunities for young people, specifically those within schools.\n&#xa0;\n7.2\n              \nThe Golf Foundation delivers its operational activity through a single programme - HSBC Golf Roots - and aims to achieve its mission by supporting community and city projects.  Through the community projects the Golf Foundation supports school and school/\nclub link activity and includes \ndelivery\n in primary schools (Tri-Golf), secondary schools (Golf Xtreme) and in clubs (outreach work).\n&#xa0;\n7.3\n              \nThe number of schools now offering some form of golfing activity has significantly increased since 2005/2006 and \nGolf\n Xtreme \nwithin secondary schools \nhas been particularly effective in attracting girls to have a go at golf, \ndue to the social aspect of the programme and also there is no requirement to get changed into PE kit which can sometimes be a barrier in itself\n.\n  \nRecent \nSportivate \ndata\n for 201\n2 to 2013 highlighted that \n2,757 young people \nhad\n engaged across 248 golf programmes, \nof which \n31% were female.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
