defaultOur 
defaultresponses focus on the need to design buildings to reduce heating, demand recover and recycle waste heat, and enable the installation and retrofitting of infrastructure to distribute renewable and recovered heat. This response is based on evidence develope
defaultd
default as part of our activities, including 
defaultreports for the Scottish
default and Westminster
default Government

default our recent book 
defaultCarbon Management in the Built Environment
default, 
defaultand through our professional networks

default&#xa0;
default1.1.
default 
defaultThe government would be wise to recognise and respond to the different challenges posed by generating and distributing renewable heat compared to renewable electricity. In addition, heat needs to be treated as a waste product as well as somethi
defaultng to be generated. As for electricity, there is huge potential in small and community scale generation, however ther
defaulte is also the need to introduce legislation to ensure waste heat is captured and recycled to local communities. This requires the Governmen
defaultt to expand its approach to enable investment in the installation of new infrastructure to connect heat sources to households and local businesses, and could significantly reduce energy demand for heating. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.1.
default 
defaultThere is little evidence to suggest that the UK's heat demand is being significantly reduced by government policy beyond existing regulatory measures, principally the Building Regulations. 
defaultDECC's own analyses rightly point to the r
defaultole of the recession as a principle factor in the decline observed since 2008, whilst final energy consumption has rarely dipped below 140,000 thousand tonnes of oil equivalent since 1970, and 
defaultthere is good agreement when these figures are adjusted for the
default impact of temperature on energy demand.  
default 
default  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.1.
default 
defaultT
defaulthis is a high
defaultly contested issue that
default, in our view,
default has not yet been adequately resolved. 
defaultThe Initiative for Carbon (
defaultICARB
default)
default, in which GCU is a partner,
default has previously issued an official statement here: 
defaulthttp://icarb.org/2012/11/28/is-biomass-really-dirtier-than-coal/
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.1.
default 
defaultThere are significant concerns over the sustainability of large scale biomass
default, and over the sufficiency of the FSC label in ensuring all biomass is sustainably sourced. Given the qua
defaultntities of wood expected to be used for biomass the 70% lower limit for FSC certification needs to become 100%, and stricter policing of overseas suppliers is needed. 
default(
defaultDr Baker has 
defaultprovided 
defaultconfidential written
default evidence on this to the Scottish Government w
defaulthich could be made available to this inquiry
default)
default.
default Longer-term, biomass can only be considered sustainable if demand for fuel can be met from within the UK.
default 
defaultThe
defaultse
default limits to the level of demand that can be met from sustainable sources
default 
defaultmean that policies on the 
defaultuse of biomass should prioritise small to medium-scale CHP and district heating projects. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.1.
default 
defaultWell-designed CHP-based
default district heating schemes should have no notable environmental impacts providing the buildings and sites selected for the CHP units
default are sufficiently ventilated and exposed to disperse emissions, particularly particulates from biomass CHP. However there are
default legitimate concerns over the impact of unabated emissions from large scale biomass, and over the use of individual domestic biomass CHP units in dense urban areas, where the 'canyoning effect' can concentrate emissions and impact on air quality.    
default      
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default6.1.
default 
defaultThe most significant risks for continuing the reliance on gas for space heating are security of supply
default and future price rises. Alastair Buchanan, the out-going head of Ofgem, illustrates the vulnerability of UK gas supplies in his talk on Ofgem's Project Discovery (see: 
defaulthttp://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Media/keyspeeches/Pages/security-of-supply.aspx
default ).
default This and oth
defaulter evidence shows that the UK is already vulnerable to interruptions and price rises, and therefore it is reasonable to recommend a transition away from using gas directly for space heating, however this needs to be supported by increased renewable electri
defaultcity generation to match, and outpace, this fuel shift. (See also Baker et al., 2012).    
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default7.1.
default 
defaultThe critical problems are a lack of investment in
default retrofitting
default infrastructure
default, and a lack of regulation to
default ensure that new housing is connected to CHP infrastructure, and to require the owners of new sources of waste heat to install infrastructure to distribute that heat to local homes and businesses. 
default&#xa0;
default7.2.
default 
defaultThe first problem requires the Government to give consist
defaultent and long-term signals to the energy industry, supported by local decision-making, to enable the industry to expand heating infrastructure and make it flexible enough to deliver a range of heating fluids (biogas, steam, etc).  
default&#xa0;
default7.3.
default 
defaultThe second problem could
default be resolved by the introduction of a Heat Planning Law to ensure waste heat is recovered and recycled to local homes and businesses. This could be introduced through the existing planning  system, and could have the additional benefit of reducing emission
defaults from transport through encouraging co-location of housing and employment.
default&#xa0;
default7.4.
default 
defaultThese issues and recommendations are detailed in our 
defaultHousing Futures 
defaultreport (Baker, Emmanuel &amp; Phillipson, 2012).
default&#xa0;
default7.5.
default 
defaultHowever there are also some significant untapped opportunities f
defaultor developing alternative sources of community heating, for 
defaultexample using flooded mineworkings (see: 
defaulthttp://www.gcu.ac.uk/newsevents/news/article.php?id=53804
default )
default  
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default8.1.
default 
defaultFigures co
defaultmpiled as part of our work 
defaultEmmanuel &amp; Baker, 2012) give approximate 
defaultcosts for
default individual domestic installations
default as
default: £2,000-£4,000 fo
defaultr solar thermal; £8,000-£17,000 for ground source heat pumps; £5,000 to £10,000 for air source heat pumps; and approximately £3,000 for individual CHP units. 
default&#xa0;
default8.2.
default 
defaultBased on our experience of working with local authori
defaultties and 
defaulthousing associations, it is the variability and uncertainty in payback periods, rather than the length of the payback period, that discourages investment. However these uncertainties can be significantly reduced by careful technology choice supported by 
defaultoc
defaultcupant education.
default 
defaultHere again, retrofitting infrastructure should be seen as ke
defaulty to enabling these technologies
default, for example by enabling CHP and GSHP community heating to be supplemented by building-integrated solar thermal and ASHPs.
default The long term aim shou
defaultld be capture and distribute or store all 'waste' heat from the built environment. 
default    
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default9.1.
default 
defaultMany experts expect overheating to become a significant problem for the UK as 
defaultclimate change progresses, however overheating can be predicted and buildings can be designed to minimise it (e.g. see CIBSE, 2013). 
default&#xa0;
default9.2.
default 
defaultAn Expert Workshop convened by ClimateXChange Scotland (Beckmann, 2013) concluded that the most significant barrier to ad
defaultapting the building stock to a warmer climate is the lack of an enabling environment. The report contains a list of 20 recommendations
default made by the experts, who included the renowned architect Bill Gething and representatives from Scotland's leading built e
defaultnvironment research groups.

defaultInstalling heat pumps at a community scale (e.g. a community ground source heat pump) entails overcoming a range of barriers, including meeting planning law requir
defaultements, raising finance, and engaging with local government, delivery partners, and end-users.
default 
defaultHowever the knock-on benefits of supporting community scale heat pumps are naturally more wide-ranging.
default&#xa0;
default10.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTake up of individual heat pump systems should largely r
defaulteflect household awareness and preference. A suggestion here is that, whilst households may be less aware of heat pumps, 
defaultthe substantial academic evidence on the comparative benefits of solar thermal (e.g. Roaf et al., 2012) is being supported by consumer 
defaultpreference.   
default 
default&#xa0;
default10.3.

defaultHeat pumps also come in a variety of forms and vary significantly in scale, from small building-mounted ASHPs to 
defaultlarge and innovative uses of the technology, for example exploiting flooded mineworkings in Glasgow (see: 
defaulthttp://www.gcu.ac.uk/newsevents/news/article.php?id=53804
default ). The RHI needs to be extended and made more flexible to better capture all these potential applications.

defaultEnrolment in the RHI req
defaultuires a Green Deal assessment, which requires an up-front fee and associates
default the RHI with a much-criticised,
default and (to date) 
defaultrelatively 
defaultunsuccessful initiative
default. It seems reasonable to expect
default that this will hamper its take up
default to some extent
default.

defaultThe Building Regulations in place across the UK currently 
defaultdisincentivise designers to use high thermal mass solutions to reduce and regulate heating energy demand, and to use natural ventilation systems (as opposed to the mechanical ventilation used in the PassivHaus system).
default Whilst both approaches are valid
default 
defaultgrea
defaultter flexibility needs to be introduced to enable natural heating
default, cooling
default and ventilation solutions can compete with mechanical solutions, and without relaxing emissions reduction goals
