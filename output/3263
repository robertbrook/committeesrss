defaultDespite earlier Land Reform legislation and unilateral action by communities like 
defaultEigg
default (of which I was a trustee for eight years), Scotland still has one of the most concentrated patterns of landownership in the developed world. I’m currently researching a
default PhD comparing Norway and Scotland – it would be hard to find a more striking contrast between two neighbouring nations. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOne reason Norway had
default 
defaultone of the widest franchises in Northern Europe was the Constitution
default 
defaultof 1814, which extended the vote to all male
default landowners over the
default 
defaultage of 25 with the result that 45 per cent of men became eligible to vote overnight.
default 
defaultThis compared with 0.173 per cent of Scots enfranchised by the British Reform Bill of 1832. Enfranchising landowners gave the vote to almost half of N
defaultorwegian men but fewer than half
default&#xa0;
defaultof one per cent of Scotsmen in the early 19th century – and the result wouldn’t be very different in either country today.
default 
defaultThe breadth of the Norwegian electorate meant that a cross-section of society had ‘skin in the game’
default and had to be politically accommodated. At first educated
default 
defaultofficials in Oslo looked down on peasants as 
default‘the
default estate of the most foolish’, but soon the liberal intelligentsia joined forces with them to make Government more responsive to Parliament, and forc
defaulte through new, elected, representative municipal councils in 1837 to permanently restrict the local power of central ‘
defaultDanophile
default’ elites and state officials.
default 
defaultThis paved the way for the subsequent development of proportional representation, a political cultu
defaultre of compromise and the embrace of equality as the nation’s guiding social and economic policy objective. In 1814, the average Norwegian man had the vote and owned his farm. The average Scotsman had neither. That continues to have a massive effect on Scot
defaulttish democracy.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultEvery system becomes self-justifying and self-generating. So landowners believe that without their management, large areas of Scotland would 
defaultlie depopulated
default and without investment
default. It’s very hard to see that

default) 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe best answer to this is an ambitious experiment begun 25 years ago by two Perthshire ecologists Ron Greer and Derek 
defaultPretswell
default. The Scottish Government website tells us “invasive non-native species are the second biggest threat
default, 
defaultafter habitat destructi
defaulton
default, 
defaultto native species and habitats worldwide.” Perhaps that’s wrong. The biggest threat to Scotland’s wonderfully diverse habitat is the legion of land owners (public and private) who believe Scotland is “naturally” a barren wilderness where nothing grow
defaults except heather moorland (for grouse shooting) and rows of tightly packed, diversity-defeating conifers (for 
defaultsale). Our land is capable of much, much more. Broad-leaved trees can grow anywhere sheep and deer are largely excluded. 
default&#xa0;
defaultYou can see natural 
defaultregro
defaultwth
default on sheep-free hills, hard-to-reach verges and central reservations where deer fear to tread. But soil also needs a revival. When that’s done, a lush, diverse, flower, herb and insect-rich woodland habitat can be re-created for next to nothing. The proo
defaultf lies in six areas of woodland off the A9 on the barren wasteland of 
defaultDalnaspidal
default by Loch Garry. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTwenty years ago local ecologists Ron Greer and Derek 
defaultPretswell
default used a “succession planting” technique – mixing 
defaultlupins
default and broom with broad-leaved saplings to 
defaultimprove the soil, provide shelter and raise micro-temperatures so the trees would finally flourish. Sheep and deer were fenced out. After two years, 
defaultlupins
default and broom seemed to take over. Today those first protective species have mostly gone, replaced by wi
defaultld raspberries, insects, herbs and flowers beneath tree species which provide daylight beneath canopies and leaf litter for bigger, healthier fish in the neighbouring loch – potentially adding to local food supplies. Exotic grey, red and green Alders have 
defaultadded nitrogen to the soil. 
default&#xa0;
defaultNon-shade creating Larch have allowed blueberries and heather to grow and make excellent wood for fuel. Ditto Norwegian Maple which also provides a source of glorious colour in the autumn. They are all non-native trees and utter
defaultly effective in transforming this part of the man and sheep-made desert that flanks the highest parts of the A9. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhy do Scots not demand leaf-litter-producing trees round lochs to double the size of fish? Is it because none but paying customers and friends
default of the landowner currently sees or tastes the high-protein products of our lochs and rivers? Ron Greer estimates the current mixed woodlands of Perthshire’s enormous 
defaultAtholl
default Estate could keep the towns of 
defaultPitlochry
default, Blair 
defaultAtholl
default, 
defaultDunkeld
default and Rannoch suppli
defaulted with wood for heat in perpetuity. With oil and gas prices about to hit the roof this winter why isn’t this home-grown solution even being discussed? Because our forests are off limits. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe could choose to transform highland deserts into mixed forests, co
defaultntaining new, self sufficient villages, fish-producing lochs and tourists keen to see the most spectacular Autumn Colours in Northern Europe.

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAs recommended by the report authors. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThere has been comment on the agricultural, conservation and access grants available to landowners. I’d like to concentrate on the vast new subsidies now being earned by landowners through wind farms – bolstering perhaps the most concentrated system of lan
defaultdownership in Europe, denying communities income and the right to a say over developments and stoking up widespread resentment to renewable energy
default,
default especially wind
default,
default as nearby resource results in next to no reduction in soaring energy bills for rural cons
defaultumers. 
defaultScotland is reputedly the Saudi Arabia of renewable energy.
default Th
defaultat
default’s assumed to be 
defaulta reference to Scotland’s vast renewable resources – in wind, hydro, biomass and marine.
default 
defaultPerhaps though, the most important parallel is rather different. Energy develop
defaultments in both countries benefit very few people directly because very few own the land.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Kirk’s recent submission to the Land Reform Review Group (LRRG) made just this point. 
default&#xa0;
default“The ownership of land in Scotland remains deeply inequitable and the new 
defaultlanded income from wind power entrenches that inequality. If landowners are gaining financial rewards from 
defaultrenewables
default while a growing number of households are living in fuel poverty, then the strong case for re-examining land reform to ensure the financial
default benefits of 
defaultrenewables
default are shared more equitably is strengthened further.”
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Tory MEP Struan Stevenson 
defaultrecently 
defaultcalculated that the Duke of 
defaultRoxburghe
default could net £1.5 million a year, the Earl of Moray, £2 million and the Earl of Glasgow more than £300,000
default from wind farms on their land. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMr Stevenson and the Scottish Tories 
defaultthink
default the solution is a one year moratorium on new wind farms and a halving of wind subsidies. And yet the Conservative environment spokesman, Jamie 
defaultMcGrigor
default and Tory MSPs Alex Fergusson
default and John Scott are all set to receive big bungs from wind turbine developers. Double standards apart though
default, 
defaultwhy is this a problem? 
default&#xa0;
defaultFirst, unlike Saudi Arabia, Scotland is a democracy where one would expect wealth
default, 
defaultincluding the wealth that arises fro
defaultm natural assets
default, 
defaultto be shared. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSecond, fuel poverty causes hyperthermia and chronic ill health
default, 
defaultso a cash share in the country’s wind earnings would be a quick way to cut bills and save lives.
default&#xa0;
defaultThirdly, high energy costs deter industry by turning energ
defaulty-rich Scotland into an energy-expensive location for new business.
default&#xa0;
defaultFinally, it could be otherwise as the intriguing tale of the “wind crofter” demonstrated this weekend (Scotland on Sunday 26.5.13) Under the 
defaultEnergise Scotland
default scheme smallholders, crofters
default and communities host small turbines and get free electricity while developers pay for the kit and sell excess energy to the grid. There may be better schemes around
default, 
defaultbut “wind 
defaultcrofting
default” demonstrates the empowering potential of wind income split more even
defaultly. A small turbine can reduce individual energy bills to zero and still make a profit for investors
default, 
defaultas long as that individual owns land.
default&#xa0;
defaultAnd there of course is the rub.
default&#xa0;
defaultScotland may be a northern energy emirate, but ordinary Scots pay the highest elect
defaultricity bills in Europe because 60% of “our” 
defaultprivate 
defaultland is owned by just a thousand people – and the disappointing interim report by the Land Reform Review Group suggests this shameful picture is not about to change.
default&#xa0;
defaultNow admittedly, land ownership and the
default possibility of free or discounted electricity have not featured strongly in the wind farm debate so far. 
default&#xa0;
defaultBattle lines have been drawn instead over appearance, intermittency and cost – and though a vocal minority won a ban on new wind farms in “scenic are
defaultas”, they’ve failed to dent the consistent majority for wind energy in regular opinion polls. 
default&#xa0;
defaultDig deeper in the data however and its clear wind energy is more popular in cities than country areas. Is that because of visual interference or financial unfair
defaultness?  We’ll probably never know. 
defaultSomehow the public hoped and presumed the renewable energy bonanza would be different. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe industry does offer community benefit – a sum per megawatt of wind generated locally. But some communities have not spent their w
defaultind cash and few have performed land buyouts to become joint wind developers – even though Duke-sized hand-outs await. What are communities waiting for?
default&#xa0;
defaultWell clarity, fairness, political backing and land reform.
defaultCommunities recognise what Ministers and the
default LRRG evidently cannot. The unavailability of land is a chronic problem and the time for sticking plaster solutions is over. Enthusiastic Scots are weary of shouldering terrifying legal burdens, cajoling reluctant banks, bending rules and using ad hoc arra
defaultngements to operate in markets designed for big commercial players.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultSince 2003 17 land buyouts have taken place and a 2011 report shows those communities are measurably more resilient than they were as private fiefdoms. In 
defaultStòras
default 
defaultUibhist
default on South 
defaultUist
default, turnover is ten times higher than it was in 2006, when Scotla
defaultnd’s largest community buyout
default 
defaulttook place. In general, school rolls have almost doubled, population has increased, energy supply systems have improved, local land ownership has prompted young people to build homes and start families and old people don’t 
defaultface the unpalatable choice of living locally without heat or in a distant old folk’s home without company. Historian Professor Jim Hunter has calculated that all the community buyouts and associated improvement grants have probably cost the public purse £
default100 million – roughly equivalent to eight weeks of agricultural subsidy. Do many other public realm projects show anything like such a healthy return on investment – in human or monetary terms? And yet, there’s still scepticism – about buyouts, community c
defaultontrol and the long term capacity of people managing their own land. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are various reasons for that. The inspiring human stories of triumph over adversity
default 
defaulton 
defaultEigg
default (for example) were all too quickly subsumed into a complex legal, political and historical case for land reform – absolutely necessary, but alienating for non-specialists. Broadcasters like the 
defaultBBC 
defaultwere wary about ‘taking sides’ and urban Scots wer
defaulte unable to see parallels between
default 
defaultdramatic land battles ‘in the sticks’ and city problems of land scarcity and high prices on their own doorsteps. Few small mainland communities were well-enough organised to take advantage of the new buyout legislation. An
defaultd relatively few estates came onto the market anyway, giving locals little chance to make pre-emptive bids.
default&#xa0;
defaultAll in all, the community buyouts of the nineties and 
defaultnoughties
default started a slow burn on neighbouring 
defaultHebridean
default islands, but failed to set the mainlan
defaultd heather alight. Now – a decade after Scotland’s historic land reform legislation – fewer than one in ten communities that
default 
defaultregistered a desire to buy land actually managed to do it, and only 142 communities out of tens of thousands even tried. That could 
defaultmean life in Scotland’s rural areas is rosy… or it could mean the community buyout model is too daunting for all but the most threatened or determined island communities like 
defaultEigg
default. I’d opt for the latter explanation. 
default&#xa0;
defaultScotland still has one of the most con
defaultcentrated patterns of landownership
default 
defaultin Europe. The government cannot finance more than a few buyouts and individuals still cannot get their hands on small, affordable parcels of land. The ball is still in t
