"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Professor Michael J Kelly FRS FREng (IPC0013)1.\n              \nIn 1868, \nthe economist \nWilliam Stanley Jevons FRS published ‘The Coal Question’.\n  He was the Lord Stern PBA of his day.\n  \nHe\n noted th\nat Britain was \naddicted to coal.  His main message was\n \nit should abandon the industrial revolution forthwith, as the future social collapse when the coal ran out (i.e. about now) would be too horrible to contemplate.  He was ignored\n and correctly so\n: alternatives to coal\n (\ni.e. oil and gas) were discovered as were much greater reserves of coal.  Arguably the world is a much better place for most people today compared with their great-grandparents in terms of the adequacy and variety of food, the quality and warmth of homes\n and the access to healthcare, education and transport.\n \n  The IPCC \nis using the science in AR5 to make\n similar claims today in the context of carbon dioxide emissions\n versus human progress\n as I now show.\n2.\n              \nThe difference between living in 1800 and now is \nthat each person in a developed country now uses about \nsix\n-seven\n times as much energy per person per day.  Indeed using the per capita consumption of energy in 1800 as a unit, today we use approximately one unit on personal mobility on land, \nnearly \nanother\n unit on mobility by air and sea, and three units on the manufacture and distribution of all that we buy.  We still use a comparable amount of energy in heating a main room of our house, sourcing local produce and tools as we did 200 years ago.\n   \nNearly\n al\nl\n this improvement in the living standards of \nthe \nseven times as many people on earth as in 1800 has been and continues to be possible \nwith\n the use of fossil fuels as the source of the extra energy.  Only of order 15% comes from biomass (i.e. using wood as\n a fuel as throughout history\n)\n, nuclear and hydropower\n,\n and \nonly \na negligible (&lt;1%) amount from renewable energy.\n    Any recommendation to reduce carbon emissions by 80% without a\n readily available and\n \nmature \nnon-carbon\n \nso\nurce of energy is actually \nmore pe\nrverse\n now\n than the recommendation of Jevons\n in 1868\n.\n3\n.\n              \nThe strength of the IPCC case that the world should severely curtail its carbon emissions\n in short order\n should be tensioned against other practical considerations.\n4\n.\n              \nEmpirical studies of the global\n climate during the 20\nth\n century all \nsuggest\n another century like the last and a\nnother\n temperature rise of order 1C.  It is only the computer models that produce the higher temperatures\n and the alarm\n.  In\n the IPCC’s \nARC, the \nconsensus\n rate of increase in temperature since 1950 has been revised down by a factor of two to a value of 0.1C/decade in agreement with the empirical results.  The computer models are acknowledged to have been predicting at least twice as much temperature rise as\n observed over the last 25 years, and\n they\n have not predicted the present \ntemperature \nstatis\n when the empirical models did, pointing \nto\n the repeated plateaux/falls starting in 1880, 1940 and now 2000.  If the present temperature \nstatis\n continues for anothe\nr decade \nor more, \nas the empirical models predict\n,\n then the climate models are \ndemonstrably and \nseriously deficient as tools to predict the future.  Should another downward reduction\n in the rate of global warming\n be needed in\n the near\n future\n to accord with\n real-world data\n, the whole edifice of ‘unmanaged man-made’ climate change will be seen as a hollow scare as based on our \nlimited \npresent scientific \nunderstanding, and \nany \npotential downsides will be centuries away with ample time for technological fixes.\n \n In the terms of a ‘risk’ analysis, the amount we should be willing to pay in any form of insuranc\ne premium should be coming down as a consequence of AR5.\n5.\n              \nAt the\n recent\n 2-day meeting at the Royal Society entitled ‘Next Steps in Climate Science – the nex\nt steps’ I got one of the key speakers Professor \nJochem\n \nMarotzke\n of\n Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, Germany\n to admit that he fully expected an upturn in the globally averaged temperature before 2020 on the basis of his models.  I was perturbed when \nh\ne was\n cautioned that he was making himself a hostage to fortune.   In mainstream science that happens all the time, and it precisely the test of prediction against data that is the test of a theory.  The more general understanding is that most scientists w\nould query the integrity and fitness-for-purpose of all of the models if they continue to miss the present hiatus should it continue for a period of 25 years.\n6\n.\n              \nIf we do spend trillions of pounds globally at redirecting human living and \nintroduce \na non-ca\nrbon energy future, just what impact will it have on the future climate?  \n Can we be sure that higher temperatures will actually be avoided?  If not\n,\n the money spent on mitigation as opposed to adaption\n would have been largely wasted in terms of opportunit\nies foregone to improve the human condition.  Is the science able to reassure us that mitigation really is value for money?\n7\n.\n              \nHow sure are we that higher temperatures really will be as bad as made out?  The temperature rise to date has coincided with impr\novements in the human condition.  How robust is the case that this will turn sour in the future?\n  Over geological times there have been wider excursions in temperature and we are in what is historically a cold but interglacial period now.\n8\n.\n              \nIf after all t\nhe analysis, the elimination of carbon dioxide emissions must be accelerated\n (a stage I am not convinced we have reached by any means)\n, then we must tackle the challenge in a way that is likely to succeed, and not repeat the \nnonsenses\n of recent decades whi\nch manifestly are not\n succeeding \nand will not \nsucceed to \ndo the job.\n9\n.\n              \nThe rush, in response to the 1970s oil crises\n,\n to install windmills and solar panels over square kilometres of the Mojave Desert \nin California \nin the 1980s should be a lesson to us now\n.  \nThey can be seen by \ngoogling\n ‘abandoned windmills’ of ‘abandoned solar farms’.  \nOnce subsidies stopped, they did not produce enough electricity to pay for the\nir\n maintenance.  \nI am not persuaded that\n the renewable tec\nh\nnologies \nare \nsufficiently more matur\ne, robust and economic \nnow than they were 30 years ago.  \n10\n.\n              \nRenewable energy sources are intrinsically dilute at source.  One needs all 1000 square kilometres of the Fen Country (now producing food) to generate \n0.8-1\nGW from biomass if we harvested and \nburned \nmiscanthus\n,\n a rapidly growing grass.  We already get 1.3GW from Sizewell B, the actual \nnuclear \nplant \nfor \nwhich is less than one tenth of a square kilometre in area.  The factor of 10,000 in \nenergy \nefficiency of the use of land is not something that \ncan be closed by tinkerin\ng with the renewable energy\n efficiency\n.   Furthermor\ne \none \ncan grow food or \nmiscanthus\n or cover the land with solar panels, but not do more than one of these\n with the land at any one time\n.\n1\n1\n.\n              \nIn 2050 most of the 9B population of th\ne earth will live in megacities.  O\nnly nuclear energy and the burning of fossil fuels with \ncomplete \ncarbon capture and storage produce \nenergy \nnumbers that add up \nto make global sense, b\nut the latter technology (i.e. capture and storage) has not been demons\ntrated as effective and safe at anything like the scale needed.    Everything else\n, and especially renewable energy technologies,\n is hubris as \nfar\n as energising megacities is concerned.\n1\n2\n.\n              \nBusiness\n as usual is already striving for sustainability as a matt\ner of \ngood \ncommercial sense – witness the myriad bulky devices of 20 years ago that are now in a smart phone in the palm of one’s hand.  The case for drastic deployment of immature and uneconomic \nenergy \ntechnologies is not made, and is \nactually \nmaking matt\ners worse in terms of both carbon emission\n increases\n and economic disrup\ntion where it has been deployed \nas \nhere in the EU in particular.\n1\n3\n. \n              \nAny policies that weaken economies will make matters worse and delay any changes that would \nameliorate environment\nal damage\n.  It was the strength of the UK economy, and not its weakness, that allowed London and other cities to be cleaned up in the 1960s.  The same process will happen in\n the cities of\n China in due course.\n1\n4\n.\n              \nMuch less panic by way of response is calle\nd for even if the worst of the IPCC predictions came to pass, but it is \nmuch less likely\n that they will, given the scale-back buried in several places in the IPCC 5\nth\n assessment\n of the mean climate sensitivities.\n15.\n              \nThe most serious defect of the IPCC 5\nth\n assessment report, as published, was the \ntruculent and \nobfuscatory\n manner with which it admitted the temperature \nstatis\n since 1996, halved its estimate of the rate of global warming over the last 60 years, and when insisting that it was more certain than \never that man was playing a role, that that role is still small in the context of the last 150 years of climate change.  A scientific report written by neutral consultants would have been much more upfront, yes, and honest, about these facts.\n16.\n              \nFinally, \ngiven that the Climate Change Act has the force of law, I would like to see a clearest possible statement of the legal consequences of the implementation of this Act going wrong: who takes legal responsibility if it proves that the expenditure in pursuit o\nf the Climate Chang\ne Act is shown to be ineffective, \nunnecessary\n or counterproductive?\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
