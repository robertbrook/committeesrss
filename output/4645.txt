&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by Prof. Caroline Whalley and Hugh Greenway&#xa0;1.1. The Elliot Foundation is a charitable multi-academy trust and primary specialist operating thirteen vibrant primary schools in the West Midlands, London and East Anglia. Our aim is to build self-improving, self-sustaining clusters of primary schools that deliver world-class education for all of our pupils.  Full details of the education and other professionals who make up the Elliot Foundation can be found on our website but our team includes, a former Director of Children’s Services, one EdD, three PhDs, two HMIs, OFSTED graded ‘outstanding’ current and former primary heads including NLEs, LLEs, one director of the DfE innovation unit, one principal educational psychologist and one expert child protection barrister.  This central team of experts exists to build and grow capacity within each of our schools across all education and organisational disciplines.  Indeed our aim is to keep expertise, money and decision making as close to the children as possible.  The best evidence for this system leadership can be seen in the upward trajectory of our member and partner schools and the fact that our headteachers are forming the targeted intervention teams that support our new academies.&#xa0;1.2. We believe that the system is beginning to work; bringing choice for parents and increased aspiration on behalf of all children.&#xa0;1.3. We believe that the single most important thing government can do in the academy programme is not to change it or dilute it but to give it time to bed down.  This will enable the emerging system to build the resilience that it so desperately needs.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.1. The effectiveness of any academy or chain in 

[[[closing]]] the gap needs to be considered in a broader sense than simply KS2 outcomes.  Notice should be also taken of the impact of inclusive primary schools on building socializing structures for disadvantaged children that is as yet insufficiently quantifiable&#xa0;2.2. We recognize that quality assuring of sponsors is critical in securing impact on student outcomes as well as maintaining confidence in the academy system.&#xa0;&#xa0;3.1. Steer EEF funding so that it incentivizes system development and research, especially encouraging NLEs, TSAs, sponsors and others to come together to identify and tackle endemic under-performance. &#xa0;3.2. Disseminate EEF findings more rapidly so that the whole system can benefit from research on “what works”.&#xa0;3.3. Create larger groups of self-supporting primary schools moving away from the idea of exceptional leaders. There simply aren’t enough exceptional leaders, NLEs and TSAs nor are these leaders necessarily in geographical areas of greatest need. Furthermore, the strengths of these leaders aren’t necessarily the ones required in the matched failing schools.&#xa0;3.4. The potential risk for a ‘successful’ school in supporting a ‘failing’ school needs to be mitigated across a larger system rather relying upon a one-to-one arrangement.  &#xa0;3.5. Address the issue of ‘testing for tots’ by establishing an acceptable baseline at reception and measuring progress throughout the whole of primary school years, rather than just through KS2.  This change would provide a genuine evidence base on what works to bring about transformational impact in the early years and in KS1. &#xa0;3.6. 'Similar schools' from OFSTED data dashboard should include intake and EAL data not just Year 2 attainment otherwise the ‘hard yards’ done by schools in areas of disadvantage to the end of KS1 will not be recognized when compared with demographically ‘fortunate’ schools&#xa0;3.7. Suggest improvements to OFSTED and FFT dashboards, by adding:&#xa0;3.8. Continue the targeting of funding to the strategies that make a difference, consider expanding pupil premium to EAL students that join in years 3 &amp; 4 to support the catch up work required so that these new arrivals become successful.&#xa0;3.9. SEND Partnerships - Traditionally schools have accepted 

[[[all ]]]children as part of a collective responsibility across an LA addressed through dual registration and/or shared services. There should be an expectation that all schools and academies will provide a network of provision in any locality and successful strategies and expertise including safeguarding are shared. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;4.1. There is a disjunction between the espoused “market led’ approach leading to freedom of choice for successful and satisfactory primary schools wanting to convert to an academy and the intercession at a number of levels by the DFE.&#xa0;4.2. Creating an academy to improve standards is more likely to be a rapid, successful process when it is the result of common consent, rather than imposition.&#xa0;4.3. Sponsors have to plan to meet the demands of school improvement, financial probity and control, health and safety and good estates management.  A clear commitment from the DfE to support them through their growth phase will significantly reduce risk and waste of public money and help establish successful academies.&#xa0;4.4. Experienced sponsors are able to judge the potential fit for a school into their academy group by interrogating the wider context behind the top-level attainment data. A dialogue with DFE should be the norm.&#xa0;4.5. Financial incentives could be considered to schools on the threshold of satisfactory or requires improvement when joining quality assured academy groups.  A more value for money approach to achieve the same outcome would be to streamline the process for approving sponsored and converter projects; where each month’s delay can incur five figure lost revenues.&#xa0;4.6. It should be noted that the replacement of LACSEG by ESG in the new funding formula is now a major disincentive to primary schools. Running a primary academy group on anything less than 5-6% of GAG is unlikely to rapidly improve standards and invites the risk of non-compliance on a range of requirements including sound estate management, governance and HR. Academy MAT’s that are mixed secondary and primary academies cross-subsidise.  An ESG of £150 per pupil equates to between 3-4% of the school’s budget.  This is no incentive for the good and outstanding primary schools to choose academy status and a reason for RI primary schools to resist the same.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]5.1. Recent announcements suggest a new middle tier of ‘Schools Commissioners’ between failing academies and DFE.  We strongly urge the committee to emphasise the use of already existing scorecards and real time data as a means of these bodies managing failure in their region. A renewed role for NCTL to broker school-to-school support for academies, alongside these bodies would bring additional capacity. &#xa0;5.2. The current DfE&#xa0;data page&#xa0;does not link to OFSTED&#xa0;school dashboard&#xa0;and the OFSTED dashboard page often does not contain academy data; these are easy wins&#xa0;5.3. Both dashboards above are aged data; DfE needs to be confident that MAT governors are receiving more up to date information in order to make timely interventions that impact on pupil progress&#xa0;5.4. A requirement that SoS receives and agrees every academy order is unrealistic if momentum is to be maintained in Primary academisation 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]6.1. The statutory functions of the LA must be made known to all sponsors by the DFE. These functions must be fully supported in all academies for example, care order requirements, child protection, place planning, excluded pupils, SEND requirements, Educational Psychology support, FSM, attendance. &#xa0;6.2. As long as the process is transparent and academies and academy chains are not excluded then there is no reason that LAs cannot continue to hold the role of place planning; the decision making needs to be conducted on behalf of all children not select groups of vocal families&#xa0;6.3. A duty to collaborate for all sponsors including free schools should be an implicit part of the funding agreement.&#xa0;6.4. The development of an escalation route that stops short of whistle-blowing to enable academies and academy groups to work with LAs on child protection is needed urgently.&#xa0;6.5. It is important for schools to be sponsored in ways that do not simply replicate the role of LAs, bringing little gain for the academies or their pupils. Academy sponsorship should bring rigorous governance and greater independence and autonomy within a democratic process. &#xa0;6.6. Governance in academies enables removal of ineffective governors and more rapid intervention to raise standards. &#xa0;6.7. Governance needs revisiting for primary schools. : Sponsored chains are more likely to have ‘professional’ or highly skilled governors which work across schools enabling them to have an overview of the locality of schools. Higher skill sets can also lead to their being more effective in holding school leadership to account.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]7.1. Into the future Ensure that any savings from LA funding are not lost to cost creep including extra management and inspection costs in DfE and OFSTED.7.2. Can we be certain that DfE and OFSTED costs can be held steady or reducing, given that more entities will need to be inspected (if MATs are to be regulated &amp; inspected which they should) and more entities need to be managed?&#xa0;7.3. Social responsibility and social cohesion must be built by schools operating within and across communities meeting local and common agendas, government must ensure that academies play their part in the wider needs of communities. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]7.4. The LA still has a role to play in conjunction with chains but far less a school improvement role. We need to adapt and nurture current system of academies and recognise that it takes time for practice to become embedded. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]8.1. Advocacy and lobbying at national policy level is already difficult for primary key stages with the result that resources are most often given or diverted into the later key stages, for example City Challenge, BSF and more recently ESG changes. &#xa0;8.2. Academy status for individual primary schools including outstanding ones is not a sustainable model. Individual academies or even small groups do not have the scale to protect themselves against risk in the form of their leadership and governance, probity, and estates. Creating larger networks and linking to academy chains gives primary schools a long-term self-improving option. &#xa0;8.3. Funding arrangements for primary schools are not favourable when compared to secondary schools (See also above 4.6). Economies of scale can only be realised if primaries can work together as a family of schools.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]9.1. We need to consolidate and grow successful chains, recognise that chains mitigate risk, bring the required coherence and integration and are therefore more resilient than small group school-to-school academy groupings. Policy Exchange report “Competition meets Collaboration” 2012 suggests, “that not only do Academies work when it comes to raising standards, but that Academy chains can be even more effective at improving results than single Academies. Academy chains can have this impact by enabling the spreading of effective educational practice and by delivering economies of scale” &#xa0;9.2. Implementation of the academy system must be given time to embed and must not be watered down or diverted into yet more alternatives for schools.&#xa0;9.3. Existing scorecards should be properly implemented and would provide the trend data and early warnings required to whatever middle tier accountability structure is implemented to oversee school failure.&#xa0;9.4. Government should expect all sponsors to work across groups of schools to create coherence to avoid isolated schools. Collaborative developments need coordination and therefore resourcing to create the improvement capacity.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
