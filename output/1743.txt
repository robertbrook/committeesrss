[[[Written evidence from the Devon Senior Voice Transport Group (TIC 078)]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;All communities, whether urban or rural, should have access to regular public transport.  Local government authorities providing financial support for services which are deemed socially necessary, may only be achieved successfully through:-a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Regular assessment (suggest by annual review) of available finance required for supporting non commercially viable services, growth and decline of communities and vehicle availability.  This list is not exhaustive.b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Dialogue and negotiation with transport providers, local community organisations, employers, schools and local health services.&#xa0;&#xa0;The specific needs of different groups of disabled passengers are now recognised in law.  Bus and train accessibility is increasingly becoming a reality.  Isolated communities are often served by narrow lanes and together with passenger numbers more suitable sized vehicles may be required.  For example a 15 seater bus compliant with the latest DDA regulations.&#xa0;3.              What are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities?  How can these challenges be overcome?Some of the challenges confronting the provision of public transport in these areas are:-a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Finance – the availability of support funding.b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Location – narrow roads may require special type of vehicle.c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Number of passengers – the smaller the number of passengers, the higher the cost of providing a service and this particularly applies to buses.d)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Availability of smaller local transport firms willing to accept this type of contract.e)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Travel patterns of a limited number of passengers. f)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[exploit it.]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Community transport is of ever increasing importance to isolated communities as it is often used to fill gaps in the public transport network.  It can take many forms with funding ranging from local volunteer fund raising to financial support from local transport authorities.  Community transport is effective by using:-&#xa0;a)&#xa0;&#xa0; Vehicles which are suited to the route(s) needed and the groups of passengers using the services and may be also be more affordable where local fund raising provides the vehicle.b)&#xa0;&#xa0; There can be a greater degree of flexibility for services arranged at local level.c)&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[f volunteer drivers from 70 to 75, subject to health and driver ability tests.]]]&#xa0;Taxis and other demand responsive services are expensive to use by those living in isolated communities.  Often these people are those whose circumstances have changed with the passage of time and they are no longer able to drive or have the use of a car.  All groups of passengers in these circumstances can have widely diverse needs which make resolving the challenges more demanding.  Many living in isolated communities do so in the knowledge that public transport is likely to be limited.Car schemes (often used for medical appointments) and innovative use of taxis are two approaches which can contribute to the easing of travel costs.Older people may find the need to move to urban areas to ease the cost of travel.  Young people of working age may also need to more away from rural areas for similar reasons.  This has a social impact on the sustainability of villages and hamlets in remote areas.&#xa0;The main challenges are:-a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Increasingly limited availability of supporting public funding.b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Low passenger numbers.c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Possible requirement for specialist vehicles.&#xa0;              These services could be made more affordable by:-&#xa0;a)&#xa0;&#xa0; Flexible thinking by local transport authorities where it is acceptable to “think outside the box”.b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Innovation and a willingness to experiment.c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Find partners, consult and negotiate.d)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Seek best practice and share successful solutions.e)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Publicise passenger numbers (not percentages) to highlight cost effective visibility.f)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Subject to finance availability, improve the travel experience quality for users of public transport by extending to use of “Real Time Information” for buses and “Customer Information System” for rail.  These measures together with the wider availability of shelters, seating and time tables at all stops, may also go some way to persuading car users to change their travel habits.

[[[Conclusion]]]   Local knowledge, together with research amongst Senior Voice Devon members and local Councillors and Officers, has enabled us to answer the questions often in a positive light.  We are fortunate in having a County Council where both Councillors and Officers take a detailed interest in all forms of public transport.  We have noted they are willing to “look outside the box” and to experiment.  They work closely with bus companies, both large and small, and have taken the lead in encouraging and being directly involved in all the Devon rail branch lines becoming members of the Community Rail Partnership.  Whilst there will always be room for improvement and some necessary adjustment of bus routes and timetabling, we note that since April 2012 only one bus service in Devon has been withdrawn entirely.August 2013&#xa0;
