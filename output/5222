[normal]Are UK policies governing who can donate blood and blood products, tissues and organs sufficiently evidence-based? 
[normal]Is NHS Blood and Transplant overly restrictive about who can donate, or should greater precautions be taken to further reduce risk?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1
[normal]              
[normal]This question is not being addressed in this submission. 
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]              
[normal]Is the Government and its scientific advisory structure sufficiently responsive to the threat posed by emerging diseases being transmitted through blood and blood products, tissues and organs?
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.1
[normal]              
[normal]The Government currently receives advice on a broad range of pathogens with a variety of transmission routes, including through blood, blood products, tissues and organs, from, amongst others, the Advisory Group on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP).  The ACDP was set up following a smallpox outbreak originating from a laboratory in Birmingham which resulted in the last ever recorded death from the disease.  The official “
[normal]Report of the investigation into the cause of the 1978 Birmingham smallpox occurrence
[normal]” (also known as the Shooter report) recommended the formation of a 
[normal]multidisciplinary
[normal] expert group – this became the ACDP.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]              
[normal]The ACDP advises the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), Ministers for the Department of Health (DH) and the Department for the Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs (DEFRA), and their counterparts in the devolved administrations, as required, on all aspects of hazards and risks to workers and others from exposure to pathogens (Appendix A - ACDP Membership, Terms of Reference and work plan for 2013/14).  
[normal]The Committee comprises a Chairman and approximately fifteen members.   Its remit has evolved over time and recently the ACDP has absorbed the work of other groups dealing with infections, notably 
[normal]the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]              
[normal]Over the past 20 years there have been a variety of committees providing expert advice to the Government on 
[normal]Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and other 
[normal]Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (
[normal]TSEs) and the risk they pose to health.  
[normal]In April 1990 the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) was formed to provide independent expert scientific advice to the Government on TSEs such as BSE, CJD and scrapie.  SEAC's remit was wide-ranging, and covered public health, food safety and animal health issues.  Following its abolition in March 2011 its responsibilities passed to the ACDP.  
[normal]2.4 
[normal]              
[normal]In order to handle these new responsibilities, which require specialist expertise, ACDP created the ACDP TSE Risk Management and the ACDP TSE Risk Assessment Sub Groups.  These merged in November 2013 to form a single ACDP TSE Sub Group (Appendix B - ACDP TSE SG Membership, Terms of Reference and work plan for 2013/14).  The ACDP TSE SG advises specifically on risk assessment and risk management of CJD and other TSEs.  A raft of infection control guidance has been produced by the ACDP TSE SG in order to minimise CJD transmission between patients.  This covers precautions that should be taken if it is known that a patient has, or is at increased risk of, CJD and is undergoing surgery on infectious tissues. It also gives recommendations on decontamination procedures in line with other national guidance (Appendix C – ACDP TSE SG infection prevention and control guidance).
[normal]2.5
[normal]              
[normal]In 2000, the UK Chief Medical Officers set up the CJD Incidents Panel (CJD IP), an independent expert advisory committee, to advise hospitals, Trusts and public health teams across the UK about the management of incidents involving all types of CJD that might result in person to person transmission.  This panel included experts in prion diseases, senior level representatives from a variety of relevant clinical specialties as well as decontamination specialists, lawyers, medical ethicists and representatives of patient groups.  It provided a unique forum for the discussion and 
[normal]management of CJD incidents within the NHS and usefully informed risk management.  The CJD IP was wound up in March 2013 but has left a strong legacy of decisions that form practical precedents for any new incidents and a document of framework advice.   This work has been incorporated into a national guidance document for the management of CJD incidents (Appendix D – CJD incident management guidance).  In addition, the Panel produced an Organs and Tissue Position Statement (Appendix E).  The management of individual incidents of healthcare exposure to CJD is now devolved to hospitals, Trusts and public health teams.  More general advice and guidance now lies with the ACDP’s TSE Sub-Group.  In addition, support is available from the CJD Section of the National Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control of Public Health England.  This acts as a clearing house for queries and can link enquirers with the UK’s various specialist clinical and research teams such as the National CJD Research and Surveillance Unit, at Edinburgh University, the Medical Research Council Prion Unit/NHS National Prion Clinic at University College London and Great Ormond Street Children’s Hospital.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]2.6
[normal]              
[normal]The joint Human Animal Infections and Risk Surveillance (HAIRS) group also reports into ACDP.  The HAIRS group is a multi-agency and cross-disciplinary horizon scanning group set up to examine risks across the all  infectious diseases, not specifically spongiform encephalopathies, which are largely dealt with by ACDP.  The HAIRS group meets to identify and discuss infections with potential for interspecies transfer (particularly zoonotic infections) which may pose a threat to UK public health (Appendix F – HAIRS Membership and Terms of Reference; 
[normal]http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/EmergingInfections/HAIRS/
[normal]). Inasmuch as HAIRS identifies risks associated with the blood supply, those risks rather than being dealt with at ACDP, are largely addressed by groups that address the safety of the blood supply such as Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO) and the UK blood services Prion Working Group (PWG).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.7
[normal]              
[normal]These committees all have a culture of working in a timely way to advise governments on the threats posed by emerging infectious diseases, including spongiform encephalopathies, although it has to be acknowledged that scientific uncertainties, a particular difficulty in prion infections for which much of the science is very different from more conventional infections, may inevitably delay what turns out, with hindsight, to be the correct response.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.0
[normal]              
[normal]Has the threat of ongoing transmission of vCJD through the blood and blood product supply been adequately mitigated?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]The ACDP and its TSE SG was consulted several times during the development of the Department of Health’s paper “
[normal]vCJD and transfusion of blood components: An updated risk assessment
[normal]” (Appendix G).  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]              
[normal]Following the publication of the risk assessment in April 2012, the ACDP published its “
[normal]Position Statement on occurrence of vCJD and prevalence of infection in the UK population
[normal]” July 2012 (Appendix H).  The aim of this document was to make available a summary of current thinking on some key scientific issues relating to vCJD including secondary transmission, including what is not known.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]              
[normal]This document considers the risks of secondary (person-to-person) transmission in some detail, including through blood and blood products.  The approach set out is a precautionary one that continues to be applied in the preparation of the ACDP TSE infection control guidance that is attached to this submission (Appendix C).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4
[normal]              
[normal]Several different groups of patients have been identified as being at increased risk of iatrogenic CJD and vCJD due to medical treatment they have received in the past.  Most of these groups have been notified so their healthcare providers can take the necessary precautions to prevent 
[normal]possible secondary transmission through surgery or other invasive treatments.  These precautions are detailed in the ACDP TSE SG infection control guidance (Appendix C).  Individuals notified as being at increased risk are also told not to donate blood, organs and tissues.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5
[normal]              
[normal]There are, however, certain individuals who, despite being at increased risk of vCJD, have not been notified.  For example, individuals at increased risk due to having received large volumes of blood in the course of their medical treatment have not been notified. This group has been discussed at length by ACDP TSE SG, and a majority recommendation not to identify and inform these patients was made, not least because the organisation of health records is such that there is no straightforward way of identifying many of them and their level of risk is difficult to calculate with any degree of certainty.  However, this was not a unanimous decision, and the ACDP TSE SG will keep the issue under review. Although these people may be unaware of their risk status they will not be endangering the blood and blood products supply as anyone who has received donated blood themselves is not allowed to donate blood.  The decision made by the UK blood services to stop recipients of blood and blood products from donating blood was a hugely significant step in reducing the risk of ongoing transmission of vCJD through blood and blood products.  However, there is, in theory at least, some risk from these patients relating to surgery on infectious tissues and the ACDP TSE SG continues to look for practical and equitable ways of managing this risk.     
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6
[normal]              
[normal]In its position statement (Appendix H), the ACDP emphasises that fundamental research into prion diseases needs to continue as well as consistent, long-term surveillance of the UK population.  It also stated that, despite the fact that vCJD remains rare and deaths from the disease peaked in the UK in the year 2000, the indication from the recent study commissioned by DH (Health Protection Report

[normal]. Prevalent abnormal prion protein in human appendices after bovine spongiform encephalopathy epizootic: large scale survey. 
[normal]BMJ 
[normal]2013;347:f5675) that prion protein deposition occurs in the appendices of about 1 in 2,000 of the UK population necessitated continued attention to the risks of secondary, person-to-person transmission, including through blood and blood products.  The Committee recommended that this should include research to support the development and implementation of risk management strategies and the gaining of further information on prevalence of infection in tissues and blood.  This approach, of course, equates abnormal prion protein deposition in the appendix with prion infectivity in other tissues, including blood.  This would imply that the person from whom that appendix was removed is infectious to others. This may or may not be true and there is a range of opinion within ACDP and the ACDP TSE Sub Group concerning the significance of the findings in the appendix studies for estimating the prevalence of vCJD infection in the UK.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.7 
[normal]              
[normal]Certainly infection has been transmitted to laboratory mice from the prion protein found in the spleen of an individual who died from other causes but had previously received blood from someone who later died of vCJD: see

[normal]doi: 10.1093/brain/awt032. Epub 
[normal]2013 Feb 28
[normal]. There is also transmission data in a number of animal species indicating a correlation between abnormal prion protein deposition in lymphoreticular tissue (
[normal]ie 
[normal]tissue like that found in the appendix
[normal])
[normal] and prion infectivity.  Such lymphoreticular tissues have also been shown to be positive for abnormal PrP prior to symptom onset in vCJD (Hilton 
[normal]et al

[normal]).  However, others question whether prion protein deposition in the appendix is, in fact, some sort of non-specific phenomenon, unrelated to dietary exposure to BSE. They also question whether, if the estimated prevalence of infection from the appendix studies is indeed 1 in 2000 and some 2 million blood donations occur a year, more vCJD cases would have been expected to have occurred. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.8
[normal]              
[normal]Ultimately these differing judgements can only be resolved by further research.  Assuming an appropriately performing blood test was available (see paragraphs 3.9 - 3.10 below) a blood 
[normal]prevalence study could be carried out, and sufficient of the blood sample retained to check whether infectivity could be established in appropriate laboratory animals from the “positive” blood samples.  In any case, examination of appendices taken out in the UK before 1980 (the rough start date 
[normal]for the BSE epidemic
[normal] in the UK) and after 1996 (when it was substantially eliminated from the food chain) is under way to provide information on the extent to which prion protein deposition in the appendix is, in fact, related to BSE exposure.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.9
[normal]              
[normal] The Committee supports the development of an accurate and effective blood test to facilitate the task of taking proportionate preventive action.  
[normal]To further this aim, in October 2012 the ACDP hosted a meeting together with another
[normal] expert group, the 
[normal]UK Blood Services  Prion Working Group, 
[normal]where a series of presentations from
[normal] four different research groups involved in the development of
[normal] vCJD blood tests were given. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.10
[normal]              
[normal]This meeting highlighted the difficulties faced by researchers working in this area and the limitations of the blood tests available at this time.  This was in terms of their reliability/ sensitivity and the suitability of the assays for large scale screening, taking account of the minimum requirements for both sensitivity and specificity as set out in the European 
[normal]In Vitro 
[normal]Diagnostic Directive.  The ACDP, nevertheless, is committed to continuing its support of this research and welcomes the opportunity to work alongside other expert committees involved in this area of work.  For example, an Oversight Committee was established in 2007 to monitor and direct the work of the 
[normal]National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) 
[normal]based CJD Resource Centre.  This facilitates the development of blood tests through the provision of samples and blind panels for assessment by those developing such tests.  It is important to recognise that the performance characteristics of a test that might be used to identify potentially infectious blood donors might well be different from those that would be suitable for a population prevalence survey.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.11
[normal]              
[normal]In conclusion, we cannot be sure that the number of vCJD cases currently identified represents the end of this disease in the UK.  The results of the recent study by Gill 
[normal]et al.
[normal] (paragraph 3.6, above) indicate that the possibility of an unknown number of further future cases cannot be excluded, especially in view of the lengthy disease incubation period of these diseases which may reach several decades, and other scientific uncertainties that still surround the behaviour of the prion agents. Examples of these uncertainties are the full scope of the natural history, symptoms and pathological pattern of disease, as well as the influence of genetic variations in susceptibility to these diseases in the UK population.  Therefore, BSE and vCJD will continue to be of concern to health professionals and the public for the foreseeable future.

[normal]Appendix E - CJD IP Organs and Tissue Position Statement[bold]CJD Incidents Panel: Organ and Tissue Position Statement – September 2012 [bold][NB The CJD Incidents Panel was dissolved in March 2013]
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction[bold]The CJD Incidents panel developed an organs and tissues statement to capture decisions and discussions arising from the advice considered and given in relation to incidents over a number of years.  The following text was not published but provided an outline from which the Panel and the secretariat could provide consistent advice on any further incidents concerning organs and tissues.  It is intended that this position statement will be reviewed periodically or as required.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Panel should not advise clinicians on the use of organs and tissues donated by people with, at risk of, or with a positive test for CJD or vCJD.  Members considered that Advisory Committee on Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO) was best placed to give advice on these issues.
[normal]1.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This does not affect the Panel’s advice to ‘at risk’ patients, not to donate organs or tissues.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Incidents involving asymptomatic donors who test positive for vCJD at post mortem, should be managed in the same way as incidents involving donors with symtomatic vCJD.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There was insufficient evidence on tissue infectivity levels to distinguish between the risks posed by different organs and tissues donated by patients with vCJD. Incidents involving all types of tissues and organs from donors with vCJD, including processed and unprocessed bone, should be managed in the same way. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Patients who receive any tissue or organ from donors with vCJD, or donors who test positive for vCJD at post mortem, should be considered ‘at risk’ of vCJD for public health purposes. 
[normal]4.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Patients who receive Haematopoietic stem cells HSC or
[normal] [bold]posterior eye tissues from donors with CJD should be considered ‘at risk’ of CJD for public health purposes. 
[normal]4.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]No actions are required for patients who have received any organs or other tissues from donors with CJD.
[normal]4.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In general, no actions are required for patients who have received tissues or organs from asymptomatic donors ‘at risk’ of vCJD or CJD. The exceptions to this are discussed in the next section ‘Reverse Risks’.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Donors of tissues or organs to recipients, who later develop vCJD, should be assessed and managed as if they had donated blood components i.e. as ‘at risk’ for public health purposes.  
[normal]5.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Recipients of any other tissues/organs from those donors (who have given tissues/organs to a recipient who developed vCJD), should be assessed and managed as if they had received blood components i.e. as ‘at risk’ for public health purposes.
[normal]5.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Donors of posterior eye tissues
[normal] [bold]or HSC to recipients who later develop CJD, should also be assessed and managed as for vCJD implicated blood components i.e. as ‘at risk’ for public health purposes. No actions are required for donors of organs
[normal] [bold]or other tissues to recipients who later develop CJD.
[normal]5.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Recipients of posterior eye tissues or HSC from those donors (who have given posterior eye tissues
[normal] [bold]or HSC to a recipient who developed CJD) should be assessed and managed as for vCJD implicated blood components i.e. as ‘at risk’ for public health purposes. No actions are required for the recipients of organs and other tissues from these donors.

[normal] This includes donors who are recipients of vCJD-implicated blood components. These recipients are managed as ‘at risk and presumed infected’ with vCJD. This category also includes donors with reactive vCJD tests at post mortem. For donors with a ‘possible’ (or unclear) CJD diagnosis, recipient notification should await diagnostic confirmation.
[normal]2
[normal]CJD includes sporadic CJD, inherited prion disease, and iatrogenic CJD (but not iatrogenic vCJD).

[normal]Veterinary Officer (Zoonoses), Chief Veterinary Officer Group
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Joint human-animal infections and risk surveillance (HAIRS) group is a Public Health England (PHE), Defra, Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency, Department of Health horizon scanning group chaired by PHE’s Department of Gastrointestinal, Emerging and Zoonotic Infections (GEZI). Representatives from Public Health Wales, Welsh Assembly Government, Health Protection Scotland, Scottish Government, Public Health Agency Northern Ireland, Department of Agriculture and Rural Development
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Northern Ireland and the Food Standards Agency also attend. The group meets every month and acts as a forum to identify and discuss infections with potential for interspecies transfer (particularly zoonotic infections). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If infections are thought to be of significance, they are included in the “
[normal]Infectious Disease Surveillance and Monitoring System for Animal and Human Health: Summary of notable events/incidents of public health significance” 
[normal]which is produced monthly by the EIZ Section at HPA Colindale. This output is circulated to members of ACDP, Department of Health, to Directors and others working in related areas in PHE, Defra departments and is placed on the PHE legacy website and Defra intranet.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The group is responsible for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The terms of reference of this group are still evolving but are currently:
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1. Hazard Identification[bold] To identify and review zoonotic or potentially zoonotic/interspecies infectious incidents which may pose a change in risk to animal or human health, whether these are acute clusters or outbreaks or increasing trends in reports of known or new infections or syndromes.  If the incident discussed falls within the remit of another group, the HAIRS group will ensure that the relevant group is aware and considering the event. These incidents are identified using a variety of sources and can be within the UK or international. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2. Risk Assessment[bold] If an infectious incident or trend has been identified, then the group discusses whether there might be a risk of interspecies transfer, which could pose a threat to animal or human public health. There are various levels of assessment and actions as outlined in annex 1 and the flow diagram.
[normal]If a member of the group considers an incident to be of high public health significance, then the HAIRS group will be convened as rapidly as possible to discuss the implications of the event and ensure all the relevant agencies are informed. Members of the HAIRS group will also act as focus through which concerns of these agencies/groups can be considered by the group.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Risk assessment 
[normal]is done using the expertise within the group or their network contacts. This allows incidents brought to the attention of the group considered to be of low public health importance to be “signed off” by the group. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. Risk Management[bold]Depending on the outcome of the risk assessment process, the HAIRS group may act as risk managers or refer issues to other groups for risk management action. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]For issues assessed as low risk or where direct action is not warranted, the group may “sign off” or “risk manage” the incident, or continue to monitor the situation and reassess the risk at appropriate intervals.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]For incidents assessed as being of potential threat to public health the group will alert appropriate groups to the situation and the need for risk management action. Members of the group will act as points of contact for the agencies and departments responsible for risk management. The HAIRS group then will not directly act as risk managers but may contribute advice and expertise to the risk management process. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4. Risk Communication[bold]The group will contribute to the monthly “
[normal]Infectious Disease Surveillance and Monitoring System for Animal and Human Health: Summary of notable events/incidents of public health significance”
[normal] and be responsible for informing other agencies after assessing the change in risk as outlined in the annex. The group will be responsible for writing up and communicating the conclusions and recommendations of any expert qualitative risk assessment process. This information will be communicated to ACDP and the UK Zoonoses and Animal Diseases and Infections Group (UKZADI), for example through circulation of the HAIRS group minutes. 
[normal]Annex 1 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Incidents* are raised by a member of the group, discussed and:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Considered to be of negligible potential risk to public health 
[normal]
[normal] no action apart from being minuted.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Considered to be of negligible or little potential risk for interspecies transfer, but included in the monthly output for interest or information. However, the group will continue to monitor the situation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]More information is needed in order to assess the incident. The group produces background information and briefing papers in order that a preliminary assessment can be undertaken. Other members of the zoonoses network or other contacts may be consulted at this stage. Where UK animal surveillance profiles are available these will be used. After reviewing this information, an incident can be assessed as negligible or low change in risk to public health on the basis of the current information. This decision would be recorded in the monthly output and the situation would continue to be monitored. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]d)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]If considered that there is the potential for zoonotic or interspecies transfer either immediately or after reviewing further information, the group will then establish whether there needs to be a formal qualitative risk assessment by an expert group. If a formal risk assessment is thought to be necessary, the group will convene this and be responsible for informing other bodies, agencies and individuals eg Department of Health, ACDP, UKZADI, Food Standards Agency, PHE Directors of Health Protection and Microbiology Services, Defra, Chief Medical Officer(s), Chief Veterinary Officer(s) etc.  The expert group will include relevant national and international experts in animal and human health and will use an agreed risk assessment algorithm which has been approved by UKZADI. If the group considers the incident to be of high public health significance, an expert group will be convened as soon as possible.
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The group will be responsible for writing up and communicating the conclusions and recommendations of the expert group.
