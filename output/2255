[normal]22 
[normal]December 201
[normal]0
[normal], the Work and Pensions Select Committee published the report ‘Changes to Housing Benefit announced in the 2010 
[normal]Budget’. This
[normal] set out the Committee’s recommendations 
[normal]in relation to the implementation of the reforms.
[normal]1.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Government provided its response to the report 
[normal]in March 2011, which the Committee published 
[normal]at
[normal]:

[normal]1.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The written evidence 
[normal]provides an 
[normal]update
[normal] to
[normal] the Committee on progress with the implementation of 
[normal]the Department’s reforms 
[normal]to support for housing costs. 
[normal]It seeks 
[normal]to address the individual lines of enquiry 
[normal]in which 
[normal]the Committee 
[normal]is 
[normal]particularly interested. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There are currently 5.1 million people in 
[normal]Great Britain
[normal] in receipt of housing be
[normal]nefit. The housing benefit bill increased significantly over the past decade, by around 50 
[normal]per cent in real terms. In 2012/
[normal]13, estimated expenditure was £24 billion.
[normal] If unreformed, expenditure on h
[normal]ousing 
[normal]b
[normal]enefit would
[normal] have 
[normal]be
[normal]en
[normal] over £26 billion by 
[normal]2014/
[normal]15.
[normal]2.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As part of its fiscal consolidation programme, the Government has introduced a number of changes to housing benefit
[normal], which save over £2 billion by 2014/15
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]h
[normal]e first sections of this 
[normal]written evidence 
[normal]provide
[normal] update
[normal]s
[normal] on:
[normal]2.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]next 
[normal]section covers 
[normal]the replacement of 
[normal]c
[normal]ouncil 
[normal]t
[normal]ax 
[normal]b
[normal]enefit by council tax reduction schemes, designed and administered loca
[normal]lly.
[normal]2.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]here is
[normal] 
[normal]then 
[normal]an update on 
[normal]the 
[normal]structural changes 
[normal]that 
[normal]replace 
[normal]h
[normal]ousing 
[normal]b
[normal]enefit 
[normal]with the housing 
[normal]costs 
[normal]element of Universal Credit
[normal] 
[normal]and a reformed scheme 
[normal]for pensioners.
[normal] 
[normal]This includes 
[normal]the plans to protect vulnerable groups through
[normal] managed payment of ren
[normal]t
[normal] to landlords, and special arrangements for
[normal] claimants 
[normal]in supported and temporary accommodation.
[normal]2.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Finally, there is a
[normal] section on support for home owners. This gives a
[normal]n update on 
[normal]s
[normal]upport for 
[normal]m
[normal]ortgage 
[normal]i
[normal]nterest
[normal] and 
[normal]sets out 
[normal]the treatment of home owners in Universal Credit and 
[normal]the reformed scheme for 
[normal]pensioners
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Reforms to Local Housing Allowance (LHA) introduced from April 2011 included setting the rates at the 30th percentile 
[normal]rather th
[normal]an the median 
[normal]of market rents, 
[normal]capping the maximum LHA rates
[normal], 
[normal]removing the 5
[normal]-bed
[normal] rate
[normal] and no longer allowing claimants to retain any excess of up to £15 a week between the
[normal]ir actual rent and the
[normal] LHA rate.
[normal]  From January 2012, the 
[normal]upper 
[normal]age 
[normal]limit 
[normal]for the LHA 
[normal]shared accommodation rate for single people 
[normal]without dependent children 
[normal]was 
[normal]raised 
[normal]from 25 to 35.
[normal]3.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]For all these reforms, claimants had up to 
[normal]nine 
[normal]months
[normal]’
[normal] transitional protection from their anniversary date, so only started to be affected 
[normal]between January 2012 and 
[normal]December
[normal] 2012
[normal].  The 
[normal]Department is 
[normal]providing
[normal] 
[normal]£40 million in Discretionary Housing Payments
[normal] 
[normal]in 2013/14
[normal] 
[normal]to 
[normal]help
[normal] people 
[normal]make the transition to 
[normal]the 
[normal]LHA 
[normal]reforms.
[normal]3.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Department has commissioned an independent evaluation of the reforms, b
[normal]y a consortium led by 
[normal]Sheffield
[normal] 
[normal]Hallam
[normal] 
[normal]University
[normal]. The
[normal] 
[normal]i
[normal]nterim 
[normal]r
[normal]eport
[normal] was 
[normal]published in May 2013
[normal]:
[normal]https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/monitoring-the-impact-of-changes-to-the-local-housing-allowance-system-of-housing-benefit-interim-report-rr-838
[normal]3.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In April 2013, following the announcement made in the June 2010 Budget, increases 
[normal]in
[normal] LHA 
[normal]rates 
[normal]were limited 
[normal]using 
[normal]the Consumer Prices Index (
[normal]CPI
[normal]) 
[normal]of 
[normal]September 2012
[normal]. 
[normal]Rates 
[normal]have 
[normal]been increased 
[normal]either 
[normal]by 
[normal]CPI
[normal] 
[normal]inflation 
[normal]or 
[normal]to 
[normal]the 30th percentile of 
[normal]market 
[normal]rents
[normal], whichever is the lower
[normal].
[normal]3.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Chancellor announced in his 
[normal]Autumn Statement 
[normal]of 
[normal]2012
[normal] that 
[normal]increases in LHA rates 
[normal]would be limited 
[normal]to 1 per cent in 2014/15 and 2015/16
[normal]. As a result, most LHA rates will be increased in 
[normal]April 2014 and April 2015
[normal] 
[normal]either 
[normal]by 1 per cent or 
[normal]to 
[normal]the
[normal] 30th percentile of market rents, whichever is the lower
[normal].  
[normal]3.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Chancello
[normal]r also 
[normal]announced that
[normal] 30 per cent of the forecast savings 
[normal]from this measure 
[normal]would be used 
[normal]as Targeted Affordability Funding 
[normal]to increase the LHA rates in some areas by more than 1 per cent, where rent increases are causing a shortage of affordable accommoda
[normal]tion
[normal].
[normal]3.7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Department intends to announce 
[normal]in 
[normal]the 
[normal]autumn 
[normal]how the funding will be targeted
[normal]. This will take account of responses to the 
[normal]c
[normal]all 
[normal]f
[normal]or 
[normal]e
[normal]vidence 
[normal]that took place 
[normal]in July.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Since 
[normal]April 2013
[normal], the removal of the 
[normal]spare room subsidy 
[normal]means that 
[normal]working-age tenants in the social sector receive 
[normal]h
[normal]ousing 
[normal]b
[normal]enefit for the number of bedrooms their household needs, bringing the rules in
[normal]to
[normal] line with the private sector.
[normal]4.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In December 2011, the Department announced 
[normal]the provision 
[normal]of £30 million per annum in Discretionary Housing Payments for 2013/14 and 2014/15 
[normal]to help people 
[normal]make the 
[normal]transition to the change
[normal]. Of this, £
[normal]25
[normal] 
[normal]m
[normal]illion
[normal] 
[normal]per annum 
[normal]is specifically to help those living in significantly adapted accommodation who 
[normal]are affected
[normal] 
[normal]by the measure.
[normal]4.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In July 2013, t
[normal]he 
[normal]Department 
[normal]announced 
[normal]further
[normal] in-year funding 
[normal]of £35 million, again 
[normal]to help claimants 
[normal]with the transition to the change
[normal]. This comprised:
[normal]4.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I
[normal]n total
[normal], the Department is 
[normal]providing
[normal] 
[normal]£180 million 
[normal]of Discretionary Housing Payment funding in 
[normal]2013/14
[normal] to cover all the welfare reforms, including ‘core’ funding of £20 m
[normal]illion p.a.
[normal]4.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]Department has commissioned 
[normal]a
[normal]n independent evaluation 
[normal]of the 
[normal]policy 
[normal]across 
[normal]Great Britain
[normal].
[normal] The consortium 
[normal]is led by Ipsos 
[normal]MORI and includes the Cambridge Centre for Housing and Planning Research and 
[normal]the 
[normal]Institute for Fiscal Studies.
[normal] Initial findings will be available in 2014 and the final report is due in 2015.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Non-dependants are people who live in a benefit claimant’s household who are not dependant children, for instance adult children, other relatives and friends. 
[normal]It is a long-established principle 
[normal]of the benefit system 
[normal]that 
[normal]they 
[normal]should be expected to contribu
[normal]te towards the 
[normal]claimant’s 
[normal]housing costs. 
[normal]5.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In the June 2010 Budget, the Chancellor announced a three-year staged increase in the rates o
[normal]f non-dependant 
[normal]deductions in housing b
[normal]enefit 
[normal]from April 2011. By April 2013, these increases brought the deduction rates
[normal] to the level they would have been had they been increased each year since 2001 to broadly reflect growth in rents. 
[normal]5.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The h
[normal]ousing 
[normal]b
[normal]enefit non-dependant deduction scheme is based on the age and circumstances of the non-dependant, and deductions are based on standard income-bands. The gross income of the non-dependant determines into which income band the non-dependant falls, and theref
[normal]ore the deduction that should be applied. There are a range of exemptions whereby a deduction does not apply. 
[normal]5.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Department estimates
[normal] that around 350,000 non-dependants are living in households where deductions are made. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]6.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he Government believes there has to be a limit to the amount of benefit 
[normal]entitlement for 
[normal]people who are not in work. 
[normal]6.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Phased implementation 
[normal]of a cap on benefits 
[normal]started on 
[normal]15 April 2013
[normal] in Croydon, Bromley, 
[normal]Enfield
[normal] and Haringey. National rollout in other lo
[normal]cal authorities 
[normal]began in July and August
[normal], with the expectation that all appropriate households will be capped by the end of September 2013. 
[normal]6.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Applying the cap through housing benefit is an interim measure
[normal]. 
[normal]In the longer term the 
[normal]Department will administer t
[normal]he 
[normal]cap as part of the Universal Credit system.
[normal]6.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Latest figures show around 40,000 households are likely to be affected.
[normal]6.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The most vulnerable, including war widows, those in the support group for Employment Support Allowance, and those with severe disabilitie
[normal]s are exempt, as are households claiming Working Tax Credit.
[normal] 
[normal]Those in supported exempt accommodation will have their housing costs disregarded from the cap calculation. 
[normal]6.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]here is a 39 week grace period for those who have been in work for 50 of the previous
[normal] 52 weeks immediately preceding their last day of work.
[normal]6.7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Department 
[normal]is working with local authorities to provide a wide range of labour market, housing and budgetary related support to help people adjust to the changes. 
[normal]It has contacted t
[normal]hose likely to 
[normal]be affected well in advance of any change taking place so that they can access this support in good time. 
[normal]6.8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]Department
[normal] is providing 
[normal]£65 million in Discretionary Housing Payments 
[normal]in 2013/14 
[normal]to help those affected by the benefit cap.
[normal] 
[normal]6.9.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A
[normal]n evaluation of 
[normal]the
[normal] benefit cap
[normal] 
[normal]operating under housing benefit 
[normal]will be published in autumn 2014
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Council Tax Benefit was abolished in April 2013 and replaced with council tax reduction schemes, designed and administered locally. Loca
[normal]lisation means that authorities make decisions as to how they raise revenue through council tax, and gives them a bigger stake in delivering economic growth.
[normal]7.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Council Tax reduction schemes will not form part of Universal Credit, and the award of a reduction
[normal] will have no impact on a claimant's Universal Credit entitlement. However, 
[normal]the Department 
[normal]recognise
[normal]s
[normal] that there are important interactions including impacts on work incentives.
[normal]7.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Department has 
[normal]worked with the Department for Communities and Local Govern
[normal]ment 
[normal](DCLG) 
[normal]to ensure that local schemes 
[normal]in 
[normal]England
[normal] 
[normal]can support improved work incentives. 
[normal]It has 
[normal]set out the key features of Universal Credit and how local authorities can apply a 
[normal]sensible means test to U
[normal]niversal 
[normal]C
[normal]redit
[normal] claimants in guidance and in the def
[normal]ault scheme. 
[normal]The Department 
[normal]and DCLG are 
[normal]also working to deliver data sharing so that claimants do not have to provide the same information to local authorities 
[normal]that 
[normal]they have already provided to 
[normal]the Department 
[normal]for their U
[normal]niversal 
[normal]C
[normal]redit
[normal] claim.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]For social sector renters, the 
[normal]housing 
[normal]costs 
[normal]element of Universal Credit 
[normal] 
[normal]comprises
[normal] 
[normal]rent and eligible service charges
[normal], less 
[normal]any 
[normal]impact from the removal of the spare room subsidy, less any 
[normal]housing cost contributions from 
[normal]non-dependants
[normal]. For private sector renters, 
[normal]the housing 
[normal]costs 
[normal]element 
[normal]is the 
[normal]lower of actual rent and service charges or the appropriate L
[normal]ocal Housing 
[normal]A
[normal]llowance, 
[normal]less 
[normal]any 
[normal]housing cost contributions from non dependants
[normal].
[normal]8.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Universal Credit contains a significa
[normal]nt change of approach to the treatment of a 
[normal]contribution
[normal] to their housing costs by non-dependants.  Instead of the current complex scale of deductions that rise with the non-dependant’s income there is a single
[normal] 
[normal]flat rate of housing cost contribution which 
[normal]will apply, irrespective of income, to non-dependants aged 21 and over, where the person is either in work or there is an expectation that they should be working
[normal] or 
[normal]can return to work.   A contribution will not be expected if the person is a carer, is resp
[normal]onsible for a young child, or is in receipt of 
[normal]certain 
[normal]disability benefit
[normal]s
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Universal 
[normal]Credit will help claimants prepare for work
[normal]. The Department has designed 
[normal]the payment arrangements to reflect those that apply to 
[normal]working people
[normal]. 
[normal]Supporting people to manage their finances including paying their rent will ease the transition into paid work.  
[normal]9.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There are advantages in paying the housing 
[normal]costs 
[normal]element of Universal Credit direct 
[normal]to 
[normal]claimants
[normal], rather than 
[normal]as managed 
[normal]payme
[normal]nts to landlords
[normal], the approac
[normal]h currently operating for most housing b
[normal]enefit claimants in the social rented sector. Direct payments 
[normal]encourage people to manage their own budget in the same way as other households. However, 
[normal]the Department 
[normal]also recognise
[normal]s
[normal] the 
[normal]importance of stable rental income for social landlords
[normal], which supports them to 
[normal]deliver
[normal] 
[normal]new homes
[normal]. It has 
[normal]develop
[normal]ed
[normal] Universal Credit in a way that protects 
[normal]landlords’
[normal] financial position.
[normal]9.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In summer 2012, t
[normal]he Department established 
[normal]six direct payment demonst
[normal]ration projects to test how monthly payments of support for housing costs paid directly to most claimants will work in Universal Credit. They will run until the end of 2013.
[normal]9.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]E
[normal]vidence from the 
[normal]projects 
[normal]indicates that most people will be able to cope with ma
[normal]naging a monthly
[normal] budget and paying their rent. 
[normal]However, the 
[normal]Department 
[normal]recognises that this is a significant change and that some people will need support, 
[normal]including budget management. 
[normal]A 
[normal]proportion 
[normal]of claimants
[normal] 
[normal]will
[normal] require 
[normal]alternative arrangements
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]including 
[normal]managed payment of rent to the landlord.
[normal]9.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Managed payments to landlords 
[normal]are part 
[normal]of the personal budgeting support process at three 
[normal]‘
[normal]touch points
[normal]’
[normal] wi
[normal]thin the Universal Credit claim
[normal]:
[normal]9.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Working closely with the housing sector, t
[normal]he Department 
[normal]will continue to feed 
[normal]learning from the 
[normal]d
[normal]emonstration 
[normal]p
[normal]rojects 
[normal]and the Universal Credit Pathfinder 
[normal]in
[normal]to 
[normal]the development of 
[normal]Universal Credit and the support 
[normal]frameworks 
[normal]that claimants may need. 
[normal]The Department 
[normal]will consider what else might be done to address 
[normal]per
[normal]sistent underpayment of rent, balanced against the importance of keeping the system simple and efficient to administer.
[normal] 
[normal]One of the main emerging 
[normal]message
[normal]s 
[normal]is 
[normal]that so
[normal]cial landlords need to engage as early as possible with their tenants 
[normal]in order to help 
[normal]prepare them for 
[normal]the change.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I
[normal]n the short term
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]the Department will continue to provide 
[normal]help towards 
[normal]the 
[normal]housing costs 
[normal]of 
[normal]those living in supported exempt accommodation outside Universal Credit, through 
[normal]housing benefit
[normal]. 
[normal]As a result, support for 
[normal]housing costs will remain 
[normal]as a managed payment to the landlord. The 
[normal]Department has made r
[normal]egulations giving powers to pay 
[normal]h
[normal]ousing 
[normal]b
[normal]en
[normal]e
[normal]fit and 
[normal]Universal 
[normal]Credit together
[normal].
[normal]10.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]For the long
[normal]er
[normal] term, the 
[normal]Department 
[normal]is 
[normal]discussing 
[normal]with stakeholders the feasibility of a localised solution. 
[normal]This is a challenging reform but the Government is committed to supporting vulnerable, older and disabled people
[normal] to lead independent and active lives in the community rather than 
[normal]their 
[normal]living in more institutionalised care. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]11.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Universal Credit claimants housed in temporary accommodation will receive their housing support as part of their Unive
[normal]rsal Credit. 
[normal]It 
[normal]will be based on the appropriate L
[normal]ocal

[normal]For 2014/15, t
[normal]he Department is developing guidance for the treatment of Universal Credit claimants in

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Department intends to 
[normal]contribut
[normal]e to 
[normal]the extra costs of providing temporary accommodation for Universal Credit 
[normal]c
[normal]laimants 
[normal]in 2014/15. There
[normal] will be a single

[normal] Credit will continue to receive maximum support with their rent, subject to 
[normal]any deductions for non

[normal]. 
[normal]12.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Welfare Reform Act 2012 allows for the introduction of a new element of Pension Credit, the Housing Credit, to provide support for rent.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]Chancellor announced in his 
[normal]Autumn Statement of 2012 that the support for mortgage interest (
[normal]SMI
[normal]) temporary measures of a shorter 13 week waiting period and a higher £200,000 capital limit for working age claimants will be exte
[normal]nded until the end of March 2015.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Universal Credit retain
[normal]s
[normal] the principle of protecting home owners from repossession as far as practicable. 
[normal]The housing 
[normal]costs 
[normal]element for owners is 
[normal]a standard
[normal] rate of interest on
[normal] the
[normal] outstanding loan up to a set capital limi

[normal]. 
[normal]There 
[normal]is 
[normal]a qualifying period before 
[normal]claimants 
[normal]are entitled to help.

[normal]There 
[normal]are 
[normal]some changes in Universal Credit from the scheme

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]Department 
[normal]envisages 
[normal]that 
[normal]the reformed scheme for meeting the housing costs of pensioners
[normal] will treat home owners in a broadly similar way to Universal Cred
[normal]it
[normal].
[normal]13.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In the longer 
[normal]term, the 
[normal]Department 
[normal]intends to move to a system of loans rather than non-recoverable benefits for supporting the housing costs of home owners.
