[normal] 2 Government papers often focus on the transparency agenda and that releasing transactional information from within government (meeting minutes, spending and so on) will encourage data journalists and ‘enthusiasts’ to audit the government on its work. While this is true (fantastic examples include the Guardian Data Blog and the work done by organisations such as My Society), the real benefit of Open Data is to empower citizens to make informed choices with the assistance of businesses working in ways that are different to government processes.
[normal]3 By this, I mean that the entrepreneurial spirit and lack of government regulation and process makes it possible for businesses to do things that would simply not occur to government either because they are outside the norm, are niche or make use of technologies and other datasets that aren’t available to the public sector. This statement is certainly not to be taken negatively as there 
[normal]are some great examples of government working in new ways to encourage change (the new gov.uk portal is a fantastic example of agile, user experience-driven web design).
[normal]4 Open Data is one of a few elements that offer a transformational opportunity to our society. Combined with growth in online services (web or app based), rapid data analysis and prediction (often called ‘big data’) and factors such as the economic climate and generational shift in consumer habits it has huge potential. Studies by various government bodies and companies try to put a value on Open Data in pounds or dollars. While this is one way of doing it, these studies have proven how difficult it is to provide an accurate figure.
[normal]5 So why is Open Data important? It is certainly valuable in creating governmental efficiency by opening up the various processes to scrutiny and working with new partners to develop new digital by default services. It is obviously of value to the wider economy. There are already many businesses of all sizes using Open Data combined with other datasets and software tools to create value for themselves, their customers and the public. A good way to visualise the value is to make a comparison with the web. If it were not free, would we all be using it for such diverse reasons? Probably not. If public information is not free and open, we simply won’t be able to get value from it in the same way.
[normal] 6 I think an ‘Open Data Strategy’ is somewhat of a misnomer. A simple mission statement will suffice. As the G8 charter states, public sector information should be ‘open data by default’. It’s pretty much as simple as that. While attention should be paid to personal and national security and the costs of releasing data, there should be no need for any strategy more complicated than ‘release the data’.
[normal]7 The UK Government have succeeded in releasing a lot of information but the commercially valuable data (as seen via the request mechanism on data.gov.uk) is often locked away for various reasons such as technical difficulty, supplier contracts, current charging regimes and legal fears. All of this could be swept away pretty quickly with a clear statement along the lines of:
[normal]8 “If public sector information does not contain personal data (as defined by the Data Protection Act), it should be released under the Open Government License, free of charge”. No excuses should be accepted around difficulty or cost. There are many organisations who would happily provide services ‘in kind’ in exchange for releasing the data. For example, if a dataset is large and hosting it expensive, why couldn’t a storage provider host it in exchange for the open release?
[normal]9 In short, a strategy is not required. Release all data as quickly as possible and work with stakeholders to remove any perceived barriers.
[normal]10 In short, empowerment. Not of the public to hold government to account (i.e. transparency) but to provide choice to users of government services such as health care and education. For example, if all cancer outcome data was released by hospital and Doctor, simple tools could be built to help the public choose the best Doctor to maximise their chances of success. Yes, this would create extra workload for the best hospitals but would surely encourage improvements in others if success could be related to funding.
[normal]11 Economic growth comes with empowerment. If re-users of PSI are empowered to access it without up-front fees, complex contracts and endless royalty audits, they can focus their resource son building better products and services to grow their businesses. This creates a positive feedback loop of more competition, innovation and ultimately; tax revenue for the government.
[normal]12 I don’t think there is a central, single strategy. Yes, the government has committed to releasing more data, has listened to the Shakespeare review and continues to support innovation via the Open Data User Group and Open Data Institute. However, the individual departmental strategies are often lacking in vision.
[normal]13 While some bodies are releasing large volumes of data (for example, the 
[normal]DfT
[normal] and ONS), others are just getting started (e.g. the HMRC consultation on data sharing) and others are either not engaging with the community or are proving difficult to convince. Some are also releasing low value, low quality data which, while meeting the requirements of central policy, is of 0 use to the public and economy.
[normal]14 In short, a clear, single statement is needed by Government as to the aims of the Open Data Strategy. Does it include trading funds? Does it include bodies which, while privatised, still provide public services? Does it require legal changes to a departments remit (e.g. HMRC)?
[normal]15 If public bodies can be given such guidance, release of data should just happen. The excuses around cost, contracts and so on will become irrelevant and the barriers to innovation will come down.
[normal]16 Key outcomes are simple. Choice, transparency, empowerment, growth.
[normal]17 The Open Data User Group, Open Data Institute and various transparency boards are already working with the market and government departments to identify what kinds of data could be useful to participants on all sides. However, more needs to be done on both sides to speed up and improve the process.
[normal]18 Firstly, more businesses need to be engaged via active promotion of ODUG and the ODI (personal research has shown a worrying lack of knowledge in the industry of both bodies). This will increase the demand side.
[normal]19 On the government side, more assistance needs to be given to departments to nudge them to release the data that will be of biggest value to the community. Support is specifically required around legal changes, supplier contracts, release and on-going costs. Expecting departments to do this on their own (or with the limited support capability of the Cabinet Office) is not enough. Much the Government Digital Service is pioneering digital by default, a similar unit is required for ‘open by default’. Recruiting the relevant talent from the community will then be possible.
[normal]20 Data.gov.uk is a superb platform. It has improved significantly in the past year or so and has the potential to continue to be a good portal for finding data. What is required though is true, universal data access.
[normal]21 Much open data is currently hosted on departmental websites (e.g. ONS, OS, local authority data stores and so on). If all data can be made available via API or a single data store, access and use will increase dramatically.
[normal]22 In terms of release, more datasets can be made available if the attitudes can be shifted from those of ‘closed by default’ and ‘cover costs/make profit by default’ to ‘open, free and available’ by default. Instead of the Open Data User Group having to make the case to open up more data, government bodies should have to make the case to keep data closed or charge for it.
[normal]23 This brings us on to the Trading Funds. The OS, Companies House, Met Office and Land Registry have all released data in an open format in one way or another. Some of this has been guided by the Open Data User Group (and wider community) and for this, the Met Office &amp; Land Registry should be applauded. What is less positive is the simple fact that these bodies are still seen as Trading Funds and some of them are just not getting ‘open’ (e.g. DVLA).
[normal]24 They all collect and process data as part of their public service remit (i.e. the government need maps to locate people &amp; places, need a property register to charge stamp duty &amp; council tax, need company data to charge corporation taxes and need weather data to plan for a zero carbon economy amongst many other uses). Much of this work is publicly funded from the taxes specifically levied on businesses, house sales and so on. A major problem is the assumption that these bodies need to also charge businesses for raw data such as addresses and maps.
[normal]25 It’s proving very difficult for the community to argue against this as the relevant cost / profit information is not made available. For example, many feel that OS 
[normal]MasterMap
[normal] should be made Open. The OS argue that the costs to produce the file need to be covered by the fees they charge for re-use. However, these numbers are not made public so no case can be made to change this situation.
[normal]26 Simply put, the Trading Fund model should be abandoned. Yes, there will be a short term impact to government coffers from the fees lost from the sale of 
[normal]AddressBase
[normal], 
[normal]MasterMap
[normal] and so on. However, open data is often seen as a long game and the vast majority of studies (along with the opinions of the community) feel that government will benefit long term through economic growth of many hundreds of companies, not just 5 Trading Funds.
[normal]27 Removing licensing constraints will also open up more opportunities for competition (e.g. new rivals to OS Points of Interest and Royal Mail PAF) and drive efficiencies across the board.
[normal]28 This is a difficult question to answer as there are over 9000 datasets on data.gov.uk alone.
[normal]29 CSV format is generally a good start. For application developers, an API is also of use. Those datasets providing both of these are generally more useful. What is difficult to judge is the understanding of the public as so many datasets will be of a niche nature and will require an understanding of the context within which the data was produced.
[normal]30 For example, a CSV file of GP surgery locations is pretty easy to understand. What makes things more difficult is when statistics are added around the services offered, performance and so on or if the data is separated out into different files by region.
[normal]31 The data becomes understandable to the public when presented via an application. A fantastic example is police.uk. If more datasets can be made available as single, national files with clear metadata, application developers will be able to do more to make it understandable to the public – powering choice &amp; transparency.
[normal]32 Again, this is rather dependent on the dataset itself. Some useful information is the coverage (in terms of geography and time), last update date, key fields and some explanation of these.
[normal]33 This is entirely dependent on the dataset itself. However, it is obvious that health and education data will be of use to the general public when made available via simple to use web tools and apps (i.e. something like NHS Choices but that actually works). It’s therefore crucial that national, standardised datasets are made available.
[normal]34 For some of the other datasets and providers mentioned, businesses of all sizes will benefit if more Trading Fund data is released openly. Good examples already exist in the property market (benefiting from open Land Registry data and maps). Perhaps the most commonly mentioned benefit would be to those SMEs who 
[normal]can not
[normal] currently use PSI as the cost is just too high. Royal Mail PAF and OS 
[normal]AddressBase
[normal] are often put up as examples of where businesses aren’t using data because of the cost. While the Royal Mail have recently announced some minor adjustments to make data available to micro-businesses for free, it doesn’t go far enough. For the investment into PAF and files like 
[normal]AddressBase
[normal] to be recognised, they must be made available to all on an Open and free basis.
[normal] 34 Success and failure so far has been mixed. The release of data initially focussed on spending and transparency and has since started moving in the right direction thanks in part to the Open Data User Group.
[normal]35 From my own interactions with public bodies from which I am requesting data, I have to say that there is a general willingness to talk, listen and learn but these well-meaning civil servants are often held back by red tape, contracts and current legislation. There is a sense of fear that releasing a dataset may go against the legislative framework for that body, could infringe security or personal 
[normal]privacy, may be technically costly, may be blocked by suppliers or may generate bad PR from the Daily Mail.
[normal]36 Public Sector staff need to be empowered to understand the business and social benefits of Open Data for their own job and the wider economy. Clear guidance and support should be offered to get round the legal and contractual issues and businesses should be actively approached to partner with bodies to get data released. If the data will benefit a business, surely they could help release it by building the business case, developing the infrastructure or working with suppliers on contract changes?
[normal]37 Until the whole public sector ‘gets it’, the success of the Open Data Initiative will be limited. The major limitation that also needs to be lifted is the presumption that Trading Funds should charge for data (within this, I include the likes of Royal Mail where they provide a public service). Data should be free and open and only special cases should be charged for on a cost recovery basis.
[normal]38 Everything Happens Somewhere (or so the OS and 
[normal]GeoPlace
[normal] like to say). Therefore, address &amp; location data is crucial. Royal Mail PAF must be open. It’s simply inexcusable to move towards an infrastructure without being to locate things.
[normal]39 Once location data is available, other datasets such as health and education facilities can be located, transport routes to them planned and access increased.
[normal]40 The Open Data User Group have identified that datasets on Land &amp; Property, health, education, environment, Companies &amp; Organisations, Transport and Finance are likely to give the greatest social &amp; economic benefit.
[normal] 41 The crime data used on police.uk is an exemplar of the benefits available to society. Combining this with property prices, school ratings and so on will empower citizens to choose the best places to live. Start-ups within the ODI and larger businesses are already taking advantage of this kind of data to provide apps and services.
[normal]42 Another stand out is the Company information already released by Companies House. This powers a range of data products from large and small businesses with business models ranging from 
[normal]freemium
[normal] to more standard transactional and subscription models. Again, this data is used as a core for more data to be added to the eventual product to add value (e.g. financial data, business contacts and so on).
[normal]43 With a rather limited team, the Cabinet Office are working hard to monitor and push departments to do more. The partnership with the Open Data User Group has helped them focus on the most commercially requested datasets.
[normal]44 The team need more resources and more assistance from Departments to publish data. Departments also need to be made aware that what they feel are their agreed datasets may not 
[normal]match up with what is actually wanted. The new ‘voting’ capability on data.gov.uk should make this clear. The success of the Cabinet Office will be seen in how quickly the popular datasets can be released by each Department.
