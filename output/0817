[normal] [bold]About diabetes
[normal] [bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.1
[normal] [bold]Type 1
[normal] [bold]diabetes develops if the body ca
[normal]nnot produce any insulin. 
[normal]About 10%
[normal] of people with diabetes have Type 1.
[normal] It cannot be prevented
[normal] and 
[normal]is treated by daily insulin doses by injections or via an insulin pump
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal] [bold]Type 2
[normal] [bold]diabetes develops when the body can still make some insulin, but not enough, or when the insulin that is produced does not work properly
[normal] (known as insulin resistance). 
[normal]It
[normal] usually appears in p
[normal]eople over 40
[normal] and 
[normal]accounts for around 
[normal]90
[normal]%
[normal] of people
[normal] with diabetes. I
[normal]t
[normal] is treated with a healthy diet and increased physical activity. 
[normal]T
[normal]ablets and/or insulin can be required.

[normal]This 
[normal]submission is divided into three priority sections for improving diabetes care and reducing costs: provision of care; integrated and personalised care and managing contributory factors. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal] 
[normal]Provision of care
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The scope for varying the current mix of service responsibilities so that more people are treated outside hospital and the consequences of such service redesign for costs and effectiveness [bold]and[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The readiness of local NHS and social care services to treat patients with long term conditions (including multiple conditions) within the community[bold]2.1
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]ntegrated pathways of care 
[normal]must be commissioned 
[normal]across primary, intermedia
[normal]te and secondary care 
[normal]to 
[normal]ensure people
[normal] with diabetes
[normal] 
[normal]get 
[normal]the 
[normal]care
[normal] and 
[normal]specialist 
[normal]treatment 
[normal]they need 
[normal]to manage their condition
[normal]. Diabetes care cannot be provided solely in primary and community care. Access to specialist care when re
[normal]quired is vital. In particular
[normal],
[normal] Type 1 diabetes support should be co-ordinated primarily from secondary care. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Stronger
[normal] community and primary care services 
[normal]with appropriate upskilling in diabetes expertise 
[normal]should
[normal] ensure 
[normal]the
[normal] focus of care is
[normal]:
[normal] coordination, prevention, structured chronic disease management
[normal], 
[normal]patient 
[normal]education and
[normal] care planning
[normal] to support 
[normal]greater 
[normal]self management
[normal]. This will help 
[normal]cut 
[normal]wastage and inappropriate hospital admissions
[normal]. 
[normal]Where hospital admissions are needed, ensuring patients have access to specialist inpatient treatment can reduce length of stay 
[normal]by three
[normal] days and save £400 per admission
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal] 
[normal]Good quality care provision in the areas outlined below would help to reduce the need for hospital inpatient care, by improving the ma
[normal]nagement of diabetes within primary and 
[normal]community
[normal] services
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Prevention and e
[normal]arly diagnosis 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal] 
[normal]Up to 850,000 people are unaware they have Type 2 diabetes
[normal]. By diagnosis, half
[normal] 
[normal]show signs of complications
[normal]. 
[normal]Early diagnosis 
[normal]is therefore crucial to ensure 
[normal]good management of diabetes 
[normal]ca
[normal]n start before 
[normal]expensive and life-threatening 
[normal]complications develop and
[normal] also
[normal] prevents existing complications getting worse.
[normal] 
[normal]It is estimated that by 2025, five million people will have diabetes – most of which will be Type 2
[normal]. 
[normal]I
[normal]nvestment in effective public awareness campaigns (explaining the seriousness of Type 2 diabetes and its complications) and full implementation of the NHS Health Checks programme will help prevention and early diagnosis
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal] 
[normal]25
[normal]%
[normal] of children and young people are diagnosed with 
[normal]T
[normal]ype 1 
[normal]due to being 
[normal]admitted to hospital
[normal] 
[normal]with Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)
[normal] 
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Increasing awareness of the signs and symptoms of 
[normal]T
[normal]ype 1 diabetes, through public health initiatives aimed at schools, the general public and general practice, can 
[normal]help 
[normal]earlier diagnosis 
[normal]of Type 1 
[normal]and 
[normal]cut 
[normal]the 
[normal]number of people who suffer 
[normal]DKA.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Provision of appropriate care checks
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5
[normal] 
[normal]Every
[normal]one
[normal] with diabetes should 
[normal]get 
[normal]a planned programme o
[normal]f NICE
[normal] recommended
[normal] checks each year. 
[normal]They 
[normal]are designed to identify the early signs of avoidable diabetic complications. 
[normal]However, only a third of adults with 
[normal]T
[normal]ype 1 diabetes and half of people with 
[normal]T
[normal]ype 2 diabetes are getting all the recommended annual tests. This is compounded by a ‘postcode lottery’ of care, which means the percentage of people receiving all checks ranges from 16 – 71% depending on their location
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6
[normal] 
[normal]The
[normal]se
[normal] nine 
[normal]checks
[normal] 
[normal]must be made accessible to all people with diabetes 
[normal]through annual care planning reviews
[normal].
[normal] The results 
[normal]of these checks 
[normal]must be used to ensure effective
[normal] treatment and 
[normal]support for 
[normal]self-management
[normal] and so cut complications.
[normal] Where the checks are delivered within an integrated care pathway, they can make a significant difference in supporting effective self management and reducing complications.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Education for self management
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.7
[normal] 
[normal]It is estimated that around 95% of diabetes care is self management. NICE guidelines, backed by strong international evidence
[normal], recommend that structured education is made available to all people with diabetes to help them understand and manage their diabetes. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.8 But too few people are offered it and not enough attend courses:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The interaction between mental health conditions and long-term physical health conditions[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.9
[normal] 
[normal]There is a greater prevalence of psychological conditions such as depression, anxiety and eating disorders among people with diabetes than the general population
[normal]. Poor emotional wellbeing is associated with sub optimal blood glucose control, which in turn can lead to the development of complications. For example, depression is twice as common in people with diabetes and can have an affect on an individual’s ability to control their diet or manage their medication
[normal]. 
[normal]2.10
[normal] 
[normal]Despite this, and the fact that treatment of psychological conditions has been shown to improve psychological wellbeing and other health related
[normal] outcomes
[normal], 85%
[normal] of people with diabetes have no access to psychological care and 
[normal]support
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Access to emotional and psychological care 
[normal]should 
[normal]become a routin
[normal]e part of diabetes management, 
[normal]reduc
[normal]ing
[normal] the ‘costs’ of untreated psychological conditions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. 
[normal]Supporting the implementation of integrated 
[normal]and personalised care
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The practical assistance offered to commissioners to support the design of services which promote community-based care and provide the integration of health and social care in the management of long-term conditions[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal] 
[normal]To achieve maximum efficiency
[normal], effectiveness
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]to 
[normal]avoid duplication and gaps in service, 
[normal]evidence shows the need to
[normal] commission fully integrated 
[normal]and well co-ordinated 
[normal]pathways of diabetes care across primary, secondary and community providers. This is key to providing positive health and management outcomes. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal] 
[normal]There is a wealth of information to support this: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The extent to which patients are being offered personalised care[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal] 
[normal]People with diabetes can live for as little as a few years or as long as 80 years with their condition. 
[normal]Personalised care should be coordinated around the person with diabetes, who is enabled to take a proactive 
[normal]lifelong 
[normal]role in shaping 
[normal]their care
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The advantages 
[normal]of better 
[normal]partnership working
[normal] are 
[normal]shown in

[normal]Year of Care
[normal] Programme

[normal]C

[normal]deliver
[normal]ed
[normal] personalised care in routine practice for people with long term conditions
[normal],
[normal] using diabetes as an example
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4
[normal] 
[normal]Despite this, 
[normal]only 50% of 
[normal]English 
[normal]patients
[normal] 
[normal]reported that
[normal] 
[normal]clinicians share decisions about treatment with them, and
[normal] a 
[normal]Diabetes UK 
[normal]survey 
[normal]in 2012 found that only 36%
[normal] 
[normal]had 
[normal]developed a care plan 
[normal]by discussing their individual needs to set targets
[normal] 
[normal]with their healthcare professional
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;

[normal] 
[normal]Integrated foot care pathway
[normal]. 
[normal]W
[normal]here effective services are in place for people with diabetes who have foot problems they are 
[normal]at 
[normal]much lower risk of 
[normal]amputation
[normal]. As part of the integrated footcare pathway, people with a foot problem should have speedy access to a mul
[normal]tidisciplinary specialist 
[normal]foot 
[normal]team
[normal]. T
[normal]his has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of amputatio
[normal]n
[normal] meeting national standards, saving costs, feet and lives
[normal] 
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.8
[normal] 
[normal]While 
[normal]these examples are encouraging, 
[normal]they are 
[normal]the exceptions and 
[normal]not 
[normal]nationally 
[normal]representative
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.
[normal] 
[normal]Managing contributory factors
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Obesity as a contributory factor to Type 2 diabetes [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1
[normal] 
[normal]Obesity 
[normal]accounts for 80-85%
[normal] of the overall risk of developing Type 2 diabetes
[normal]. As almost two in every three people in the UK are overweight or obese
[normal], the main strategy for reducing the rising prevalence of Type 2 diabetes should be to tackle the rise in obesity. 
[normal]F
[normal]ull implementation of the NHS Health Check programme 
[normal]would lead to better early diagnosis and prevention of diabetes. 
[normal]Other 
[normal]priorities are: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The implications of an ageing population for the prevalence of diabetes, and the extent to which services have the capacity to meet future demands[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4.2
[normal] 
[normal]Older people are more likely to have diabetes. 
[normal]In England the prevalence of diabetes across all ages is 
[normal]currently 
[normal]5.5
[normal]%
[normal]. This increases with age to 14
[normal]%
[normal] prevalence in over 65s
[normal]. It is likely therefore, that the ageing population will contribute significantly to the increasing prevalence of diabetes
[normal] and co-morbidities
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3
[normal] 
[normal]Current services do not have the capacity to meet predicted future demand. 
[normal]This is largely 
[normal]because
[normal] diabetes in older people requires careful management due to the complex interaction between the process of ageing, the increased prevalence of co-morbidities, widespread vascular disease and functional loss.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4
[normal] 
[normal]It is therefore essential that prevention, education, better care and the i
[normal]mplementation 
[normal]of integrated pathways of care are prioritised to address this. 
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal] 
[normal]Conclusion
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1
[normal] 
[normal]People with diabetes must have access to high quality services to enable them to effectively manage their condition
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Commissioning and care delivery needs to focus on improving organisational proc
[normal]esses,
[normal] 
[normal]engaging people with long term condition
[normal]s in
[normal] their own care and changing healthcare professionals
[normal] attitudes across each local care system. 
[normal]To achieve this
[normal],
[normal] strong national leadership
[normal], collaboration between multiple commissioners and providers,
[normal] 
[normal]effective systems of accountability 
[normal]and a joined up system of incentivisation 
[normal]are needed to ensure integrated, personalise
[normal]d care is 
[normal]the norm.
