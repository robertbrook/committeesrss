defaultPage .
default I graduated from Oxford with a BA degree in Geology in 1957 and subsequently earned a PhD in Geology from the University of Illinois in 1961.
defaultMy professional career was spent in 
defaultInternational Oil Exploration both as an employee of major corporations and from 1979 on as an independent consultant.
defaultMuch of the exploration geologist’s work consists of correlation in time and space of multiple streams of data time series of multiple va
defaultriables to elucidate the geological history of potential oil bearing basins and then making decisions under uncertainty .The fact that one’s forecasts will soon be tested 
defaultby the expenditure of millions of dollars tends to concentrate the mind and force a f

defaultFollowing retirement in 2002 I have been able to pursue my scientific interest in Climate Science and have maintained a blog site

defaultModels and CO2default&#xa0;
defaultThe CAGW meme is built on the outputs of climate models. Many of the modelers and IPCC
default&#xa0;
default and Met Office scientific 
default&#xa0;
defaultchiefs had a background in weather forecasting In spite of
default&#xa0;
default the inability of the 
defaultweather models to forecast more than about 10 days ahead, in an act of hubris, the modelers
default&#xa0;
defaultallowed
default&#xa0;
default themselves
default&#xa0;
defaultto believe, or at least proclaim, 
default&#xa0;
defaultthat they knew enough about the physical processes and
default&#xa0;
defaultclimate driving factors
default&#xa0;
default involved to forecast global t
defaultemperatures for decades and centuries ahead
default 
default.Indeed,
default&#xa0;
defaultmany establishment 
default&#xa0;
defaultscientists
default&#xa0;
defaultappear to
default&#xa0;
defaultthink that
default&#xa0;
defaulthumanity 
default&#xa0;
defaultcan dial up a desired global temperature by keeping CO2 within som
defaulte
default&#xa0;
defaultappropriate limit. This is
default nonsense!
defaultIn practice the modelers have known 
defaultfor some time that their models have no skill in forecasting and have indeed said so in the
default WG1 reports.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe IPCC AR4 WG1
default&#xa0;
defaultscience section actually acknowledges this fact. Section IPCC A
defaultR4 WG1 8.6 deals with 
defaultforcings
default,
default&#xa0;
defaultfeedbacks and climate sensitivity. The 
defaultconclusions are in section 8.6.4 which deals with the reliability of the projections. It concludes:
default"Moreover it is not yet clear which tests are critical for constraining the future projections, consequently a set of model metrics that might be used to na
defaultrrow the range of plausible climate change feedbacks and climate sensitivity has yet to be developed"
defaultWhat could be clearer. The IPCC in 2007 said itself that we don't even know what metrics to put into the models to test their reliability
default.-
default i.e. we don't 
defaultknow what future temperatures will be and we can't calculate the climate sensitivity to CO2.This also begs a further question of what
default&#xa0;
defaulterroneous 
default&#xa0;
defaultassumptions (e.g. that CO2 is the main climate driver) went into the "plausible" models to be tested anyway.
default&#xa0;
defaultTh
defaultis means that
default&#xa0;
defaultthe successive SPM 
default&#xa0;
defaultuncertainty estimates take no account of the structural uncertainties
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultin 
default&#xa0;
defaultthe models and that almost the entire
default&#xa0;
defaultthe range of model outputs may well lay outside the range of the real world future climate variability. By th
defaulte time of the AR5 report
default the warming hiatus and the recent cooling show that 
defaultthis is obviously the case
default.
defaultThe key
default factor in
default&#xa0;
defaultmaking CO2 emission 
defaultcontrol policy is 
defaultthe climate sensitivity to CO2. In 
defaultthe 
default AR5
default&#xa0;
default - WG1
default 
default the IPCC is saying: (Section 9.7.3.3)
default"The 
defaultassessed literature suggests that the range of climate sensitivities and transient responses covered by CMIP3/5 cannot be narrowed significantly by constraining the models with observations of the mean climate and variability, consistent with the difficult
defaulty of constraining the cloud feedbacks from observations
default.
default "
defaultIn plain English this means that they have no idea what the climate sensitivity is and tha
defaultt therefore that Governments 
defaultlogically 
default have
default no empirical scien
defaulttific basis for their economically destructi
defaultve climate and energy policies.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe IPCC
default climate models are incorrectly structured because they are based on three irrational and false assumptions. First that CO2 is the main climate 
defaultdriver ,
defaultsecond that in calculating climate sensitivity the GHE due to wa
defaultter vapo
defaultr should be added to that of CO2
default as a 
defaultfeed back
default effect and t
defaulthird that the GHE of water vapo
defaultr is always positive
default 
default.As to the last point the feedbacks cannot be positive otherwise we wouldn't be here to talk about it .
defaultTemperature drives both CO2 and water vapor independently
default,.
default The whole CA
defaultGW - GHG scare is based on the obvious fallacy of putting the effect before the cause.
default 
defaultAs a simple (not exact) analogy controlling CO2 levels to control temperature is like trying to lower the temperature of an electric hot plate under a boiling pan of wat
defaulter by capturing and sequestering the steam coming off the top
default 
default.
default A corollary to this
default is that the whole idea of

default climate sensitivity to CO2 is nonsense and the sensitivity equation has no

defaultFurthermore the 
defaultmodelling
default approach is inherently of no value for predicting future temperature with any calculable certainty because of the difficulty of specifying the initial c
defaultonditions of a large number of variables with sufficient precision prior to multiple iterations. There is no way of knowing whether t
defaulthe outputs after the parameteriz

default&#xa0;
defaultIndefault summary the projections of the IPCC - Met office models and all the impact studies which derive from them are based on specifically structurally flawed and inherently useless models.

defaultI have combined the PDO, ,Millennial cycle and neutron trends to estimate the timing and extent of the
default coming cooling in both the Northern Hemisphere 
default&#xa0;
defaultand Globally.
defaultHere are the conclusions of those posts.
default1/22/13 (NHdefault)default1) The millennial peak is sharp
default&#xa0;
default - perhaps 18 years +/-. We have now had 16 years since 1997 with no net warming - and so might expect a
default sharp drop in a year or two - 2014/16 -with a net cooling by 2035 of about 0.35.Within that time frame however there could well be some exceptional 
default&#xa0;
defaultyears with NH temperatures +/- 0.25 degrees colder than that.

default The cooling gradient might be 
defaultfairly steep down to the

default minimum equivalent which would occur about 2100. (

default(default&#xa0;defaultFigdefault 3 here)default&#xa0;
defaultwith a total cooling in 2100 from the present estimated at
default&#xa0;
default about 1.2 +/- 
default3) From 2100 on through the Wolf and 
defaultSporer
default minima equivalents wit
defaulth intervening highs to the Maunder Minimum equivalent which could occur from about 2600 - 2700 a further net cooling of
default&#xa0;
default about 0.7 degrees could occur for a total drop of 1.9 +/- degrees

defaultcooling

defaultin

default 2014 - 16
default&#xa0;
default is stren
defaultgthened by recent developments already seen in solar activity. With a time lag of about 12 years between the solar driver proxy and climate we should see the effects of the sharp drop in the 
defaultAp

The pattern method doesn't lend itself easily to statistical measures. However st
defaultatistical calculations only provide an apparent rigor for the uninitiated and in relation to the IPCC climate models are entirely misleading because they make no allowance for the structural uncertainties in the model set 
defaultup.This
default is where scientific judgme
defaultnt comes in - some people are better at pattern recognition and meaningful correlation than others. A past record of successful forecasting such as indicated above is a useful but not infallible measure. In this case I am reasonably sure - say 65/35 for ab
defaultout 20 years ahead. Beyond that certainty drops rapidly. I am sure, however, that it will prove closer to reality than anything put out by the IPCC, Met Office or the NASA group. In any case this is a Bayesian type forecast- in that it can easily be amende
defaultd on an ongoing basis as the Temperature and Solar data accumulate.
