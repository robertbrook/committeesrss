[normal]Written e[bold]vidence [bold]submitted [bold]By[bold] Dr Norman Page (IPC0058)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]I am Norman J 
[normal]Page .
[normal] I graduated from Oxford with a BA degree in Geology in 1957 and subsequently earned a PhD in Geology from the University of Illinois in 1961.
[normal]My professional career was spent in 
[normal]International Oil Exploration both as an employee of major corporations and from 1979 on as an independent consultant.
[normal]Much of the exploration geologist’s work consists of correlation in time and space of multiple streams of data time series of multiple va
[normal]riables to elucidate the geological history of potential oil bearing basins and then making decisions under uncertainty .The fact that one’s forecasts will soon be tested 
[normal]by the expenditure of millions of dollars tends to concentrate the mind and force a f
[normal]ocus on empirical data rather than theoretical speculations
[normal] 
[normal].
[normal]Following retirement in 2002 I have been able to pursue my scientific interest in Climate Science and have maintained a blog site

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Models and CO2[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The CAGW meme is built on the outputs of climate models. Many of the modelers and IPCC
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] and Met Office scientific 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]chiefs had a background in weather forecasting In spite of
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] the inability of the 
[normal]weather models to forecast more than about 10 days ahead, in an act of hubris, the modelers
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]allowed
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] themselves
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]to believe, or at least proclaim, 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]that they knew enough about the physical processes and
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]climate driving factors
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] involved to forecast global t
[normal]emperatures for decades and centuries ahead
[normal] 
[normal].Indeed,
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]many establishment 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]scientists
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]appear to
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]think that
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]humanity 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]can dial up a desired global temperature by keeping CO2 within som
[normal]e
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]appropriate limit. This is
[normal] nonsense!
[normal]In practice the modelers have known 
[normal]for some time that their models have no skill in forecasting and have indeed said so in the
[normal] WG1 reports.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The IPCC AR4 WG1
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]science section actually acknowledges this fact. Section IPCC A
[normal]R4 WG1 8.6 deals with 
[normal]forcings
[normal],
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]feedbacks and climate sensitivity. The 
[normal]conclusions are in section 8.6.4 which deals with the reliability of the projections. It concludes:
[normal]"Moreover it is not yet clear which tests are critical for constraining the future projections, consequently a set of model metrics that might be used to na
[normal]rrow the range of plausible climate change feedbacks and climate sensitivity has yet to be developed"
[normal]What could be clearer. The IPCC in 2007 said itself that we don't even know what metrics to put into the models to test their reliability
[normal].-
[normal] i.e. we don't 
[normal]know what future temperatures will be and we can't calculate the climate sensitivity to CO2.This also begs a further question of what
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]erroneous 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]assumptions (e.g. that CO2 is the main climate driver) went into the "plausible" models to be tested anyway.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Th
[normal]is means that
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]the successive SPM 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]uncertainty estimates take no account of the structural uncertainties
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]in 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]the models and that almost the entire
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]the range of model outputs may well lay outside the range of the real world future climate variability. By th
[normal]e time of the AR5 report
[normal] the warming hiatus and the recent cooling show that 
[normal]this is obviously the case
[normal].
[normal]The key
[normal] factor in
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]making CO2 emission 
[normal]control policy is 
[normal]the climate sensitivity to CO2. In 
[normal]the 
[normal] AR5
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] - WG1
[normal] 
[normal] the IPCC is saying: (Section 9.7.3.3)
[normal]"The 
[normal]assessed literature suggests that the range of climate sensitivities and transient responses covered by CMIP3/5 cannot be narrowed significantly by constraining the models with observations of the mean climate and variability, consistent with the difficult
[normal]y of constraining the cloud feedbacks from observations
[normal].
[normal] "
[normal]In plain English this means that they have no idea what the climate sensitivity is and tha
[normal]t therefore that Governments 
[normal]logically 
[normal] have
[normal] no empirical scien
[normal]tific basis for their economically destructi
[normal]ve climate and energy policies.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The IPCC
[normal] climate models are incorrectly structured because they are based on three irrational and false assumptions. First that CO2 is the main climate 
[normal]driver ,
[normal]second that in calculating climate sensitivity the GHE due to wa
[normal]ter vapo
[normal]r should be added to that of CO2
[normal] as a 
[normal]feed back
[normal] effect and t
[normal]hird that the GHE of water vapo
[normal]r is always positive
[normal] 
[normal].As to the last point the feedbacks cannot be positive otherwise we wouldn't be here to talk about it .
[normal]Temperature drives both CO2 and water vapor independently
[normal],.
[normal] The whole CA
[normal]GW - GHG scare is based on the obvious fallacy of putting the effect before the cause.
[normal] 
[normal]As a simple (not exact) analogy controlling CO2 levels to control temperature is like trying to lower the temperature of an electric hot plate under a boiling pan of wat
[normal]er by capturing and sequestering the steam coming off the top
[normal] 
[normal].
[normal] A corollary to this
[normal] is that the whole idea of 
[normal]a simple
[normal] climate sensitivity to CO2 is nonsense and the sensitivity equation has no 
[normal]physical meaning unless you already know what the natural cont
[normal]rols on energy inputs are already i
[normal].
[normal]e
[normal].
[normal] the extent of the natural variability.
[normal]Furthermore the 
[normal]modelling
[normal] approach is inherently of no value for predicting future temperature with any calculable certainty because of the difficulty of specifying the initial c
[normal]onditions of a large number of variables with sufficient precision prior to multiple iterations. There is no way of knowing whether t
[normal]he outputs after the parameteriz
[normal]ation of the multiple inputs merely hide compensating errors in the system as a whole. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In[bold] summary the projections of the IPCC - Met office models and all the impact studies which derive from them are based on specifically structurally flawed and inherently useless models. They deserve[bold]&#xa0;[bold]no[bold]&#xa0;[bold]place in any serious discussion of future climate trends[bold] and represent an enormous waste of time and money. As a basis for public policy their [bold]forecasts are grossly in error[bold]&#xa0;[bold]and therefore worse than useless.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The Way Ahead.[bold]A Simple Rational Approach to Climate Forecasting based on Com[bold]mon Sense and Quasi [bold]Repetitive -[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Quasi Cyclic Patterns.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How then can we predict the future of a constantly changing climate? A new fo
[normal]recasting paradigm is required.
[normal]It is important to note that it in order to make transparent and likely skillful forecasts it 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]is not 
[normal]necessary to understand or quantify 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]the interactions of the large number of interacting and
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]quasi - independent physical processes and variables
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]which produce the state of the climate system as a whole as represented by the temperature metric.
[normal]By identify
[normal]ing quasi periodic and quasi –repetitive patterns in the temperature and diver data
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]simple ,transparent
[normal] and likely reasonably skillful climate forecasts are possible .This method has been explained in a series of posts at
[normal] 
[normal]http://climatesense-norpag.blogspot.com
[normal] 
[normal]here
[normal] are the conclusions of the latest post
[normal]“In earlier posts on
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] at
[normal] 4/02/13 and 1/22/13
[normal]I have combined the PDO, ,Millennial cycle and neutron trends to estimate the timing and extent of the
[normal] coming cooling in both the Northern Hemisphere 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]and Globally.
[normal]Here are the conclusions of those posts.
[normal]1/22/13 (NH[bold])[bold]1) The millennial peak is sharp
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] - perhaps 18 years +/-. We have now had 16 years since 1997 with no net warming - and so might expect a
[normal] sharp drop in a year or two - 2014/16 -with a net cooling by 2035 of about 0.35.Within that time frame however there could well be some exceptional 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]years with NH temperatures +/- 0.25 degrees colder than that.
[normal]2)
[normal] The cooling gradient might be 
[normal]fairly steep down to the 
[normal]Oort
[normal] minimum equivalent which would occur about 2100. (
[normal]about
[normal] 1100 on Fig 5) 
[normal]([bold]&#xa0;[bold]Fig[bold] 3 here)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]with a total cooling in 2100 from the present estimated at
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] about 1.2 +/- 
[normal]3) From 2100 on through the Wolf and 
[normal]Sporer
[normal] minima equivalents wit
[normal]h intervening highs to the Maunder Minimum equivalent which could occur from about 2600 - 2700 a further net cooling of
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] about 0.7 degrees could occur for a total drop of 1.9 +/- degrees
[normal]4)The time frame for the significant
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]cooling 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]in
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 2014 - 16
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] is stren
[normal]gthened by recent developments already seen in solar activity. With a time lag of about 12 years between the solar driver proxy and climate we should see the effects of the sharp drop in the 
[normal]Ap
[normal] Index which took place in 2004/5 in 2016-17.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] - 0.5
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6 
[normal]General Conclusion - by 2100 all the 20th century temperature rise will have been reversed,
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7 By 2650
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] earth could possibly be back to the depths of the little ice age.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]9 [bold]Warning !![bold]&#xa0;[bold] There are some signs in the Livingston and Penn Solar data that a sudden drop to the Maunder[bold] [bold]Minimum Little Ice Age temperatures could be imminent - with a much m[bold]ore [bold]rapid and[bold] economically disruptive[bold]&#xa0;[bold]cooling than that forecast above which may turn out to be a best case scenario.[bold]How confident should one be in these above predictions? The pattern method doesn't lend itself easily to statistical measures. However st
[normal]atistical calculations only provide an apparent rigor for the uninitiated and in relation to the IPCC climate models are entirely misleading because they make no allowance for the structural uncertainties in the model set 
[normal]up.This
[normal] is where scientific judgme
[normal]nt comes in - some people are better at pattern recognition and meaningful correlation than others. A past record of successful forecasting such as indicated above is a useful but not infallible measure. In this case I am reasonably sure - say 65/35 for ab
[normal]out 20 years ahead. Beyond that certainty drops rapidly. I am sure, however, that it will prove closer to reality than anything put out by the IPCC, Met Office or the NASA group. In any case this is a Bayesian type forecast- in that it can easily be amende
[normal]d on an ongoing basis as the Temperature and Solar data accumulate. 
[normal]If there is not a 0.15 - 0.20.
[normal] 
[normal]drop
[normal] in Global SSTs by 2018 -20 I would need to re-evaluate.
