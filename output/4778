defaultThe Children's Society is a leading national charity, providing vital help to the most vulnerable children, young people and families in our society through a range of services. We work with over 48,000 children each year, supporting them and advocating on their behalf to tackle discrimination or disadvantage in their daily lives. Our priority is children who have nowhere else to turn, such as young refugees, children at risk on the streets, disabled children and children in trouble with the law. We seek to give a voice to children and young people and influence policy and practice so they have a better chance in life.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOur submission is based on evidence from our research and direct work with looked after children. It is also informed by the joint inquiry into children missing from care by the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for young runaways and missing children and adults and the APPG for looked after children and care leavers that we supported last year. We deliver 
defaulteleven 
defaultprojects working with children who run away or are at risk of being sexually exploited, supporting around a thousand children every year. We have campaigned to protect young runaways through policy, research and practice for over 25 years. We also work with looked after children through nine projects that provide advocacy services, support independent visitors for looked after children and support children in care councils.

default3. Issues that need to be addresseddefault&#xa0;
default3.1. Vulnerable adolescentsdefault&#xa0;defaultResearch evidence suggests that
default professionals’ perceptions of teenagers as more resilient and able to cope with maltreatment than young children affects how cases of older children are assessed and whether protection is offered to them.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe APPG (All Parliamentary Party Group) report into children who run away or go missing from care
default received evidence from professionals and young people about negative attitudes some professionals have towards older children that are not reflective of a good safeguarding response. They reported that professionals label children who run away 
defaultor 
defaultare at risk of sexual exploitation as ‘troublesome’, ‘promiscuous’, or ‘choosing such lifestyles’.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Education Select Committee in its report ‘Children First. The Child Protection System in England’
default (2012)
default 
defaultalso 
defaultreported evidence from different organisations that older children are often not treated and assessed the same way as younger children for child protection purposes. The committee in particular recommended that 
default‘
defaultOfsted monitor and report as a standard part of all inspections on the quality and suitability of the provision made by local authorities for older children, taking into account the views of the children themselves. It is essential that as much attention is paid to the care options provided for vulnerable young people as to those provided for younger children’.

default3.2. defaultVulnerable 16-17 year olddefaultsdefault&#xa0;defaultDespite the Southwark judgement
default and the subsequent guidance
default, our services 
defaultfrequently 
defaultstill support and advocate on behalf of 16 and 17 year olds who are at risk of abuse, neglect, domestic violence, exploitation or homelessness, or are unaccompanied minors, but are not taken into care and supported according to their needs by children’s services as set out in this guidance. Some local authorities routinely place 16 and 17 year old children in bed and breakfast or other inappropriate accommodation where they are at risk of going missing or being subjected to abuse and exploitation. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOne stark example of where this guidance was not followed is the serious case review in Manchester of ‘Child S’
default. The child was abandoned by his father and left without any means of support. He was street homeless for periods of time and eventually supported in bed and breakfast accommodation. Child S was not assessed as a Child in Need and his needs for education, health and beyond were never addressed. He was found hanged in local authority bed and breakfast accommodation and it is believed that Child S took his own life. The review states that the response to Child S’s presenting circumstances was not consistent 
defaultwith the findings from the Southwark judgement and although immediate legal advice had been circulated to relevant practitioners in the local authority, the implications of this judgement were not contained in updated procedural guidance.  
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is essential that Ofsted inspects the implementation of this guidance rigorously. Otherwise unaccompanied children such as Child S will have no-one looking out of them; no family or other support network to ensure that what happened to them comes to light and that action is taken to prevent anything similar happening to another child.

defaultRecommendation 2:default 
defaultWe believe that local authorities should be inspected on whether they have fully implemented the statutory guidance provision of accommodation for 16 and 17 year old young people who may be homeless and/or require accommodationdefault.default&#xa0;default3.default3default. Children missing from homedefault&#xa0;defaultFrom our direct work with children who run away from home and from care in different parts of the country we know that local authorities may have different responses in place for these two groups of children. For example, the provision of return interviews following a running away episode in many areas is limited to one of these groups, rather than to both as required under statutory guidance. This has been highlighted in the Ofsted on thematic inspection report on missing children published in February 2013. Our report on the provision of return interviews for young runaways also confirms this.
defaultThe systems and processes in place to identify vulnerable children missing from home and vulnerable children missing from care are also different. For example, local authorities will be collecting their own data on children missing from care but not data on children missing from home so they will have to rely more on good co-operation with their local police force. Therefore, we believe it is crucial that performance of a local authority in relation to missing children is judged by two separate descriptors.
defaultRecommendation 3: defaultWe believe that local authorities and other local agencies should be inspected on whether they have implemented and followed in full the statutory guidance on children who run away or go missing from home or care (DfE, 2013)default.default&#xa0;
defaultRecommendation 4: defaultWe believe that there should be two separate descriptors in Ofsted inspections with a focus on missing children: a descriptor on children missing from home and a descriptor on children missing from caredefault.default&#xa0;default3.4. default‘Absent’ children defaultThere should also be a separate descriptor for absent children. The roll-out of the new police definitions of ‘missing’ and ‘absent’ is not underpinned by an evaluation of safeguards in the pilot areas to ensure that absent children are protected and not put at risk as a result of this change to police practice. The change of definition means children and young people classified as absent will be treated as a low risk cases and will not receive any immediate response from the police to locate them or any follow-up response when they return. This may lead to vulnerable children, particularly those not yet known to social services, falling through the net and not being picked up by 
defaultservices until the situation in their lives reaches a crisis point. 
defaultThe University of Portsmouth has recently published research looking at how children ‘classified’ as ‘absent have been safeguarded in police forces where the new definitions have 
defaultbeen implemented

defaultThe revised statutory guidance on children missing from home or care (2013) requires children’s homes and foster placements to report data on children absent without authorisation from their placements to the local authority. We believe that an assessment of the responses and follow-up support these children receive following an unauthorised absence, as well as the quality of risk assessment during their absence should also form part of the inspection on looked after children
