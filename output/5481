[normal]KPMG LLP—Written evidence[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]On behalf of KPMG in the UK, I am pleased to respond to the above call for evidence and have included our comments below. 
[normal]I will be sending separate representations on the Taxation of Partnerships and only deal with Tax Policy Making in this letter. 
[normal]If you
[normal] require any further detail or would like to discuss any of the comments raised, please
[normal] do not hesitate to
[normal] contact me.
[normal]Overview[bold]2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Overall, we consider the new approach to tax policy making has been implemented well and 
[normal]is 
[normal]l
[normal]argely meeting its objectives. 
[normal]Howe
[normal]ver, w
[normal]e do consider that 
[normal]there is room for improvement.  I have set out below a summary of the key themes we are seeing and this is followed
[normal] by some more detailed examples:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The process works best when there is a clear explanation of the policy intent at 
[normal]the start;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In some cases the policy approach does not seem to be followed as there is no or little consultation;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Where there is a consultation process, sometimes the consultation timetable does not allow business sufficient time to respond;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Where legis
[normal]lation is to be subject to a substantial rewrite
[normal] (such as the loan relationship rules) 
[normal] it would be helpful if the rewrite is not timed to coincide with other significant changes (such as the GAAP conversion deadline)
[normal];
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In many case, the consultation seems 
[normal]to progress in a satisfactory manner but at the end there is a rush to get legislation drafted in time for the 
[normal]Finance B
[normal]ill. This often results in badly drafted legislation which then has to be “corrected” in guidance notes;
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Where
[normal] substantial changes to ne
[normal]eds to be made during the consultation process it may be better start the drafting afresh rather than trying to adapt what has already been prepared.
[normal]Examples[bold]Life a
[normal]ssurance tax regime
[normal]3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]An example of good practice where the new approach was followed was the
[normal] development of the 
[normal]new 
[normal]life a
[normal]ssurance tax regime. 
[normal]In our view, the consultation was seen as a success by both Industry and HMRC\Treasury. The project was delivered on time, the legislation is more straightforward and the overall regime simpler than the fo
[normal]rmer
[normal]. 
[normal]Points of difference were, mostly, resolved in a way that was mutually agreed. 
[normal]4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Some of the reasons for the success are:
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There was a time limit on the consultation
[normal] and a clear need for new legislation
[normal] 
[normal]due to the expected implementation of
[normal] S
[normal]olvency 
[normal]II
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]  This was recognised by both i
[normal]ndustry and HMRC\Treasury so that solutions had to be found.
[normal] 
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The consultation was well led and managed by Andy Stewardson
[normal] who stayed with it until the end and was assiduous in consulting on all relevant matters
[normal].
[normal]  Represent
[normal]atives from insurance groups, industry bodies and advisers contributed their knowledge and expertise to the process and as a result the final outcome was widely seen as acceptable
[normal] and workable
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The life assurance industry is fairly small in terms of numbe
[normal]rs of firms and most tax directors know each other already, as well as know
[normal]ing
[normal] the 
[normal]HMRC 
[normal]C
[normal]ustomer 
[normal]R
[normal]elationship 
[normal]M
[normal]anager
[normal]s
[normal] (obviously that is not something which Government policy can influence)
[normal].
[normal]  This meant that there was a focussed group with a largely commo
[normal]n purpose.
[normal]5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, despite being viewed by us as a success, there were still some issues
[normal] identified with the consultation
[normal]:
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Small firms were not directly represented and relied on advisers and it was difficult to get their input
[normal].
[normal] HMRC should 
[normal]find a way of 
[normal]seek
[normal]ing input from all affected taxpayers
[normal].
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In a number of cases we were told that it was too late 
[normal]to change the drafting
[normal], even as early as January 2012
[normal].  If there is a genuine consultation, this needs to be better managed. 
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Due to the complexity and scope 
[normal]of the legislation, t
[normal]he burden on clients (and advisers)
[normal] 
[normal]of participating in the consultation 
[normal]should not be underestimated.
[normal]  The process should not be started unless there is a clear need and well understood policy intention.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]Banking Levy
[normal]6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Bank Levy w
[normal]as introduced in Finance Act 2011 and the Government committed to undertake a review in 2013.   The review of the Bank Levy commenced shortly after most banks had submitted their first returns under the tax and accordingly there was minimal appetite for ra
[normal]dical changes to the structure of the levy.   In some respects the timing of the review was unfortunate as there are a number of regulatory changes that may impact the Bank Levy methodology but these were not sufficiently advanced at the time of the consul
[normal]tation to inform legislative change.    However, the Government was committed to the original timetable and the consultation nevertheless served a useful purpose in confirming that the Levy was broadly operating effectively.   
[normal]7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We believe the Bank Levy rev
[normal]iew was handled well by HMRC and whilst there are questions as to whether a review in 2013 was necessary it is a good example of the Government reviewing and evaluating a new tax.    The consultation itself did follow the stages one to three of the develop
[normal]ment of tax policy (legislative changes were included in the 2014 Finance Bill and therefore remaining stages of consultation fall outside the period covered by this report).   Indeed it is encouraging that HMRC stated that they consulted informally to inf
[normal]orm the content of the consultation exercise.   Although this pre-consultation was not widely publicised, it is nevertheless a welcome pre-curser to a formal consultation exercise
[normal].
[normal]8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The one criticism is that the changes announced at the 2013 Autumn Statement were cast in terms of a broadening of the Bank Levy base.   If this was the policy intention this was not made clear as part of the consultation process.  
[normal]9
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The most contentious el
[normal]ement of this consultation was a proposal to reinforce an entirely voluntary Code of Practice with a statutory regime for “naming and shaming” institutions that were considered by HMRC to be non-compliant.   This raised real issues as to how the 
[normal]administra
[normal]tion of the UK tax system is perceived by international investors  and we believe these important policy considerations were not given adequate attention as part of the consultation process.   
[normal]10
[normal] 
[normal]Having said this, the consultation process did ensure that som
[normal]e safe-guards against unwarranted “naming and shaming” by HMRC were ultimate included in the draft Finance Bill clauses.   Whilst we believe the Finance Bill legislation will still play badly with international investors the outcome was improved by consult
[normal]ation.    However, some of the reputational damage could have been mitigated had the original policy objectives been subject to consultation in advance of HMRC releasing draft legislation.   We recommend therefore that where proposals are likely to be cont
[normal]entious that there is a separation between stage two and three of the consultation process.    
[normal]Corporate debt and derivative contracts
[normal]11
[normal] 
[normal]The
[normal] consultation on modernising the taxation of corporate debt and derivative contracts was viewed by us as partly follo
[normal]wing the new policy. The overall timetable for the consultation and implementation of changes could have been much better managed. A lengthy 109 page consultation document was released over the summer and request for responses requested by the end of Augus
[normal]t, which did not allow sufficient time for business to provide a full and proper response.
[normal]12
[normal] 
[normal]The timetable of the changes being proposed in two tranches i.e. in Finance Bill 2014 and Finance Bill 2015 will mean that the bulk of the regime changes will take e
[normal]ffect from 1 January 2016 with some changes proposed to be introduced early in piecemeal fashion. Most groups (with calendar year ends) will have to deal with UK GAAP transition for year commencing 1 January 2015. This means that there will likely be inter
[normal]im measures required by regulation for the year end 31 December 2015, until the new regime takes effect – whilst this is necessary, it will add some complexity and uncertainty. In addition groups will have to manage two very complex transitions in the spac
[normal]e of 2 years. Given these factors and
[normal] the
[normal] intention to include some clauses in Finance Bill 2014, the consultation process should have been started 12-24 months earlier
[normal] 
[normal]or possibly delayed
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]13
[normal] 
[normal]Subsequent to the release of the consultation document, we welcome the approach 
[normal]adopted
[normal] by HMRC to the ongoing consultation discussions, which have been professional, constructive and undertaken in an open and cooperative manner. HMRC seem keen to understa
[normal]nd instances where potential proposals may cause problems for business, meeting an objective of the new approach to policy making. In some instances, HMRC have come to sensible conclusions despite internal pressures.
[normal]Statutory residence test
[normal]14
[normal] 
[normal]Another exampl
[normal]e where the new approach was followed in part was the statutory residence test consultation.  The new approach was successfully followed until the legislation was subject to last minute changes after the Finance Bill was published – namely the split year r
[normal]ules and the meaning of working full time in the UK or overseas. 
[normal]These later additions are impractical and result in uncertainty which the statutory residence test hoped to avoid.
[normal]Real
[normal] Time Information
[normal]15
[normal] 
[normal]An example where the policy was not followed was the R
[normal]eal Time Information consultation where HMRC and the Department for Work &amp; Pensions would not jointly consult with businesses. When consultation with business finally took place, HMRC said the “on or before” rule was 
[normal]required
[normal] by the DWP and DWP said it was
[normal] 
[normal]required
[normal] by HMRC.
[normal] The lack of consultation on the early design of the system is now causing extra burdens for businesses, HMRC and agents as HMRC’s Debt Management Teams chase “incorrect debts” without full sight of the data submitted. This will only be e
[normal]xacerbated if the automatic issuing of penalties commences without these problems being addressed.
[normal]Partnership taxation
[normal]16
[normal] 
[normal]The partnership taxation changes are another example where the framework for tax policy making has not
[normal] been properly followed
[normal].  
[normal]This has
[normal] resulted in unclear legislation which requires a significant amount of guidance to interpret
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I will submit further written evidence on this part of the call for evidence in a subsequent letter
[normal].
