[normal](TIC 115)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Thank you for inviting this submission into reintroduction of sustainable rural rail public transport to the City of Ripon, and towns of Wetherby and Tadcaster
[normal] in the Counties of North and West Yorkshire.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The proposal stated hereinafter refers to the campaign started in 1987 to reinstate the railway Harrogate-Ripon-Northallerton closed in 1967. In 2011, the campaign was extended to include Ha
[normal]rrogate-Wetherby-Cross Gates-(Leeds) and Wetherby-Tadcaster-Church Fenton-(York/Doncaster/Leeds), closed in 1964, to create a new sustainable strategic freight and passenger through route. We are advised and supported by professional transport consultants 
[normal]who think this proposal is sound and realistic as it would:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]INTRODUCTION
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There has been rapid growth in rail travel over the last ten years to the point where more passengers are using the rail Network than at any time since 1929 when there was nearly double the amount of capacity. In the Leeds City Region, passenger footfall h
[normal]as grown by 54% in the same timescale that National footfall has increased only
[normal] 
[normal]39%. This has created “Capacity Crunch” on local routes into Leeds. Justine Greening, MP, promised 5% additional peak time seats by 2018 with trans Pennine electrification but 
[normal]this has already been swallowed up six years before delivery. At current rates of growth, 30% additional seating will be needed by 2018 unless above inflation fare increases strangles demand.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]When the campaign started in 1987 to put Ripon back on the rail
[normal]way map, the Northallerton-Ripon-Harrogate route had been closed for twenty years. Ripon had noticeably declined in prosperity in the intervening years and continues to do so. The purpose of the campaign was to reduce traffic on the A61 Ripon-Harrogate roa
[normal]d in the peaks and provide a better public transport hub for Ripon and surrounding hinterland. Outside peak hours at that time there was an hourly bus to Harrogate throughout the day with last buses finishing about 10.00pm. North of Ripon, the local bus se
[normal]rvice was almost non-existent (as it still is to-day) with only three buses a day to Thirsk. Barbara Castle stated in 1966 that there would be a replacement express bus to Thirsk and Northallerton railway stations as a condition of approving closure in 196
[normal]7. This service lasted less than two years. This was not adequate for the 900 students at Ripon Teacher Training College for evenings out or for travelling home at weekends mid term. The whole College supported the campaign to restore a railway service. Re
[normal]instatement didn’t come fast enough as student numbers dwindled to the point where College was not sustainable and closed in 2002 after 140 years as a higher educational establishment. Ripon lost £4m contribution annually to the local economy from students
[normal] and lecture staff. Beeching had a far greater impact on the prosperity of Ripon than just losing a rail service. The Principal blamed closure on the closure of the railway as students had cited poor transport communications preferring to attend the twinne
[normal]d College of York St John. Decline will continue as the Ministry of Defence announced earlier this year closure of Ripon Army Barracks with the loss of local civilian jobs and the loss of 1,800
[normal] 
[normal]military incomes to the local economy. If ever railway reinsta
[normal]tement is needed to boost the economy here in Ripon, now is the time. Closure is to save £200m
[normal] 
[normal]of Defence budget annually. Rail reinstatement Harrogate-Ripon-Northallerton could easily be paid for out of first year savings and needs reinstating as soon aft
[normal]er closure in 2017 as possible.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The current bus service in 2013 is every 15 minutes Ripon to Harrogate between peaks but inexplicably only every 30 minutes in the peaks and hourly between 7.00pm and 11.00pm. This level of service is only sustained by the 
[normal]large number of bus pass journeys. Without bus pass concessions (530,000 journeys between Ripon and Harrogate in 2011) this frequency would be unsustainable so indirectly is heavily subsidised. Eight buses an hour passing through the narrow, congested city
[normal] centre streets is now becoming a problem with air quality and cause for concern of environmentalists and the City Council. North of Ripon only five buses a day between the hours of 7.30am and 5.30pm Sundays, Bank Holidays excepted and four daily during sc
[normal]hool holidays. There is no integration whatsoever with trains at Thirsk and Northallerton stations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The A61 is the most dangerous road in Yorkshire. According to the Office of National Statistics there have been 23 fatalities on the eleven miles section b
[normal]etween Ripon and Harrogate alone since 1999. A car occupant is 60 times more likely to be killed on this stretch of road than a passenger on a parallel railway. (DfT statistic)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A Ripon-Harrogate reinstatement feasibility study was conducted between 2004 a
[normal]nd 2006 producing a Demand Forecast, Environmental Impact Study and Engineering Appraisal. It was forecast that 
[normal]0.72m passengers per year would use Ripon station if reopened, almost the same actual footfall figures for Skipton, another North Yorkshire mark
[normal]et town of similar population, in the same year. There would be a reduction of 143,000 car journeys per annum on the A61 between Ripon and Harrogate as 65% of all commuters travelling out of Ripon daily, travel along the A61 for all or part of their journe
[normal]y to Harrogate, 49%, Leeds, 11% and Bradford, 5%.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.02m visited attractions within Greater Ripon in 2012 such as Ripon Cathedral, Ripon Racecourse, Newby Hall, Fountains Abbey and Lightwater Valley Theme Park. All visitors travelled by road but it was est
[normal]imated in 2006 that 5% would come by rail if the station was open but not contribute to fares taken at Ripon booking office. This is additional to the 0.72m estimated footfall in the same year. Contributory revenue is difficult to estimate so wasn’t includ
[normal]ed. Contributory revenue was certainly not taken into account in the highly flawed analysis of the Beeching Report. This resulted in many marginally profitable stations closing unjustifiably including Ripon and many smaller coastal resorts that had a summe
[normal]r influx of visitors who booked their travel tickets at inland towns and cities remote from seaside resorts. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I was privileged to unofficially see the balance legers for the Workington-Cockermouth-Keswick-Penrith line for 1962. The line as a whole ran at 
[normal]a loss all year round but in the 12 weeks of summer, contributory revenue from the Saturday and Sunday excursion trains from Whitehaven/Workington, Newcastle, Manchester and elsewhere and the 5 or 6 special trains run from London for Keswick Convention eve
[normal]ry Eastertime more than covered the direct operating losses. British Rail lost this annual revenue forever after the line closed in 1966/72 as it all moved to road transport or didn’t travel at all causing a drop in the local economy of Keswick. This conce
[normal]pt was only recognised and accepted during the 1980s in the campaign to save the Settle to Carlisle railway line.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Cost of reinstatement from Ripon to Harrogate was calculated at £43m +/- 33%. This produced a BCR of 1.22 so was not taken forward by North Y
[normal]orkshire County Council in 2006.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The campaign was revived in 2011 after reading Reports by ATOC “Connecting Communities” and Network Rail “East Coast Capacity Review 2016”. If Northallerton-Ripon-Harrogate could be extended to Wetherby and Leeds the busin
[normal]ess case would be more favourable as all the boxes would be ticked in the ATOC Report. ATOC calculated Harrogate-Ripon reinstatement only with a BCR of 4.3 without Capex. After reading East Coast Capacity Review 2016 it was decided to go with an additional
[normal] route from Wetherby to Church Fenton to create a strategic through freight route allowing diversion of freight off the ECML. It was stated by Network rail that 
[normal]one freight train on the ECML takes up the space of two high speed passenger paths.[bold] As an addit
[normal]ional 80 passenger train and 30 freight train paths
[normal] 
[normal]daily have been identified on the ECML between Doncaster and Northallerton post 2016, 27 freight trains each way per day need routing another way to create the capacity required. This should push BCR high
[normal] enough to be competitive with other rail infrastructure proposals such as reinstatement of East West railway, Reading and Kings Cross station improvements. Access charges from freight alone would pay for reinstatement of this route within 60 years. This i
[normal]s the Government benchmark for funding projects.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]According to the Leeds City Region Local Development Framework, Ripon and Wetherby are planned to expand by 22,000 residents collectively by 2025. 7,000 houses are planned for East Leeds either side of the 
[normal]abandoned Wetherby-Cross Gates trackbed and possibly over it as route protection of the trackbed has been withdrawn. It is essential that this route is protected as it will provide high volume transport into and out of the centre of Leeds in the peaks in o
[normal]nly a few minutes, much faster than street-running trams proposed by Leeds City Council and supported by local MP Alec Shelbrooke.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Funding at present is being raised, by donations, for a feasibility study on the extended proposal to determine BCR. Time co
[normal]nsuming as North Yorkshire County Council and Leeds Metro will not contribute. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]PUTTING THE CASE FOR REINSTATEMENT
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Leeds-Cross Gates was mostly quadruple track until after the Wetherby line closed in 1964. At the first opportunity this section was reduced to double track to save on track maintenanc
[normal]e and signalling costs. This section would have to be quadrupled again.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Due to development on certain parts of the trackbed between Cross Gates and Wetherby, particularly former station sites at Thorner, Bardsey and Collingham, there will have to be some 
[normal]offline deviation and new build. Depending on how many of these settlements wish to retain a station on a reinstated railway, depends on the route chosen. Stations would be desirable as all these villages have expanded considerably since closure of the rai
[normal]lway in 1964. Wetherby has almost doubled in size since Beeching chose it as the first closure in his 1963 Report. It is proposed to double again to 22,000 by 2025. A route has been identified with a line speed of 80/90mph for non-stop trains between Leeds
[normal] and Wetherby
[normal] 
[normal]using 60% of the original formation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Onwards to Harrogate, offline construction will be required around the village of Spofforth but the original trackbed can be used to the former Crimple Junction where the Leeds-Horsforth-Harrogate line is
[normal] still operational. 100mph would be attainable from Wetherby to within a mile of Harrogate station. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]From Bilton Junction, just over a mile north of Harrogate, line speed again would be 100mph all the way to Ripon. Two miles of offline construction would 
[normal]be necessary to bypass the settlement of Wormald Green as a long cutting has been filled-in with domestic refuse on top of bagged asbestos fibre. Avoiding this former looping route will reduce the distance by over half a mile and create a straighter alignm
[normal]ent. A quote of £4.3m to empty this cutting and remove contents to a recognised landfill site is almost the cost of new build to divert around it. It also solves a problem providing an overbridge, in excess of £1.0m, at a former level crossing due to site 
[normal]constraints and proximity of the A61 and dwellings.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Due to development of the station site at Ripon, construction of Ripon City bypass on the former trackbed, the A1(M) upgrade to six lane highway and the trackbed being incorporated into agriculture
[normal] 
[normal]elsew
[normal]here, much of the Ripon-Northallerton section will have to be new build as far as Maunby. The advantage of this is that as the area is flat, agricultural and sparsely populated, the line can be engineered to 125mph alignment. It is unlikely trains capable 
[normal]of this speed will be daily users, but it is proposed to make this route a diversion route for York-Northallerton in the event of planned or emergency closure. Diverting this way should add no more than 30 minutes to an East Coast journey; important in cal
[normal]culating late arrival refunds.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Trains stopping at Northallerton have to do so on the main East Coast lines in between 125mph trains and soon to be 140mph when IEP is introduced. Two additional platforms are needed to the east of the present ones to segreg
[normal]ate Teesside stopping trains from non-stop East Coast trains. As Northallerton station is elevated on embankment, grade separation is 
[normal]possible at the south end without interfering with non-stop trains. This would eliminate an at grade junction for Teesside
[normal] immediately to the north of the station and the conflicting moves that presents. The opportunity can be taken with this upgrade to connect with the line from Ripon.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is proposed, in the trans Pennine post electrification draft timetable, to operate six
[normal] trains per hour from Manchester to Leeds with two per hour extended to Newcastle and one each per hour extended to Middlesbrough and Hull. Together with a York-Blackpool service, Leeds-Selby and Leeds-York all stations services, Cross Country, an occasion
[normal]al East Coast service and freight trains not to mention the Leeds East Parkway shuttle service Metro wishes to introduce, Leeds to Micklefield Junction could see 13 trains per hour each way 
[normal]on an already[bold] 
[normal]optimised route[bold]. This is impossible with an at grade
[normal] junction, four intermediate stations and a further two proposed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] This could be reduced to 11 an hour each way by diverting the two Newcastle trains per hour via Wetherby, Harrogate and Ripon to Northallerton. This would provide all three towns with an ex
[normal]ceptional 30 minute interval service with each other and with stations to Manchester/Manchester Airport/Liverpool and Newcastle.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] As this route is shorter than via York, there will be energy savings. Operating the Middlesbrough service this way was conside
[normal]red as it was to remain diesel operated
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] and would remove a diesel operated service from an otherwise all electric line but this was discounted for the reason that the business case for electrifying to Middlesbrough was being investigated subsequently. The
[normal] three towns would have a reduced hourly only service and Thirsk would lose a service as stops were unlikely to be inserted into Newcastle trains.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] If Northallerton-Middlesbrough electrification study shows sufficient value to justify proceeding, then perh
[normal]aps an additional service per hour can be extended beyond Leeds to Middlesbrough via Harrogate avoiding the busy section Leeds to Micklefield.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I have always considered extending some Manchester-Newcastle trains to Edinburgh replacing some East Coast stops
[normal] between Newcastle and Edinburgh allowing Kings Cross-Edinburgh services to be accelerated. They could return to Manchester via Carstairs, Carlisle and Preston and vice versa in a loop. This would increase productivity of the units by reducing down time at
[normal] turnround in Edinburgh. Five coach IEP trains would be more suitable for this service having uniformity of top speed with East Coast trains and more suitable for long distance inter City travel than Class 350/4 units on order that I hope is just a stop ga
[normal]p solution.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Manchester-Preston-Glasgow/Edinburgh is 40 miles longer than Manchester-Euston yet there is no comparison in the quality of trains operated on each route. Liverpool-Newcastle is the same distance as Kings Cross York and again the comparison of 
[normal]train quality is unequal.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The ideal freight trains to divert are the ones to and from Teesside bound for Doncaster and the ECML or Sheffield and the Midlands. These could easily be diverted via Harrogate, Wetherby and Tadcaster to Church Fenton then rout
[normal]ed via Pontefract to South Elmsall and Bentley to Doncaster where an existing grade separated junction at Bessecarr allows access to the upgraded Lincoln line and eventually Peterborough. Freight for Rotherham and Sheffield would continue through Moorthorp
[normal]e and not turn off at South Elmsall.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There would have to be additional reinstatement to accommodate this traffic. From Wetherby, there would be some new offline construction at two sites to Tadcaster but from here new construction would be required west o
[normal]f Tadcaster, over the A64 dual carriageway to south of Stutton. and then original trackbed to Church Fenton where a new chord would be constructed over the Leeds-York line to meet at a junction with the Church Fenton-Pontefract line at Little Fenton. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]At 
[normal]South Elmsall, a junction would have to be installed to meet with the Leeds-Doncaster mainline where there was a former junction but to take both lines over to the southwest side. Quadruple track would be installed from here to Doncaster segregating freigh
[normal]t, twice hourly trains stopping at South Elmsall, Adwick and Bentley and twice hourly Sheffield-Doncaster-Adwick SYPTE shuttles from twice hourly non-stop Leeds-London trains. This would allow slight acceleration of London trains. Time is allowed for late 
[normal]running stopping trains as there is nowhere to overtake between South Elmsall and Doncaster. The two additional lines would enter Doncaster on the west side of the complex remote from the station and ECML. The only conflicting move is with the Doncaster-Sh
[normal]effield line that crosses at the immediate south of Doncaster station. The route to Lincoln can then be accessed through the West Yards and flyover without further confliction.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Removing freight on the two track York-Doncaster section of the ECML would all
[normal]ow more passenger trains and reduce conflicting moves with trains off the Leeds line at the flat junction to the immediate north of Doncaster. It also removes congestion of southbound ECML freight trains running through Doncaster station heading for Sheffi
[normal]eld and the Midlands having to cross the northbound fast and slow line at the flat junction immediately south of the station.

[normal]Conversion of Drax power station, near Selby to burn biomass will result in additional trains from the Port of T
[normal]yne as biomass only has one third the thermal energy of coal. As there will be

[normal]little storage at Drax
[normal] because unlike coal, biomass must be kept dry and not stored in the open, the plant will operate the 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“just-in-time” system meaning that deliveries must be 100%

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Network Rail i
[normal]s planning to build additional platforms at Leeds to increase station capacity. The cost of one platform can be avoided by creating a through service from Harrogate via Horsforth returning to Harrogate via Wetherby as in a teardrop and vice versa. This wou
[normal]ld double the service from Harrogate by still using four car units and serve reopened stations on the Wetherby route. Platform blocking would be abolished as through platforms would be used with much reduced dwell time.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Leeds Metro has been planning a shu
[normal]ttle service from Micklefield to Leeds as a park and ride service. Again there is the problem of turnround time at Micklefield on a very busy route and junction even if a dedicated turnround siding and platform are provided. How much better it would be to 
[normal]continue beyond Micklefield to Church Fenton a few miles further on and return to Leeds via Tadcaster, Wetherby and Cross Gates and vice versa in another teardrop on the proposed reinstated line.
[normal] 
[normal]This would improve interchange at Church Fenton if the adjac
[normal]ent former RAF Church Fenton is converted into a Yorkshire airport. The other Yorkshire airports at Leeds/Bradford and Doncaster are not rail connected. At Leeds through platforms can be used with the same train continuing to say Bradford, Skipton, Ilkley,
[normal] Huddersfield or Hebden Bridge via Halifax. This will reduce platform blocking again at Leeds west end freeing up 
[normal]another bay platform. The sketch map accompanying this submission will aid explanation of concept.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In 1971 at decimalisation, my daily commute from Harrogate to Leeds was 0.34p for 36 miles of travel. Petrol was 0.34p per gallo
[normal]n, yes, gallon. The same rail journey to-day is £9.00 return but petrol is only £6.80 a gallon. To make matters worse, car parking in 1971 was free but now Northern charge £3 per day so effectively the daily rail commute is £12.00 nearly double the price o
[normal]f a gallon of petrol used in the same commuting distance. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Peak Car use was passed in 1997 falling to 2007 and has flat lined since. The Banking Crisis had nothing to do with the decline as it happened before the Crisis. It has more to do with high 
[normal]insurance costs for under 25 years old drivers and high cost of owning a car generally. Six Form students at Ripon Grammar School were asked what changes in Ripon would improve their lives the most in a survey by the Civic Society. Unprompted 72% wrote dow
[normal]n railway station.

[normal]CONCLUSION
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I hope I have fully explained the case for reinstating Northallerton-Ripon-Harrogate-Wetherby-Cross gates and Wetherby-Tadcaster-Church Fenton. Primarily reinstatement 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]is to provide additional capacity but also can become a
[normal] passenger reconnection for the growing communities of Ripon, Wetherby and Tadcaster providing travel opportunities, increasing social inclusion and 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]connectivity, particularly northwards, for all age groups. Money saved by planned infrastructure enhanceme
[normal]nts at York and Leeds could part fund this reinstatement as well as access charges particularly from the heavier and slower MGR coal/biomass freight trains. Savings from fare refunds/compensation of delayed or cancelled passenger/freight trains when the EC
[normal]ML is closed in an emergency, north or south of York, needs including in the calculations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Ripon City Council are unanimous in their support for this proposal, but although Wetherby and Tadcaster Town Councils cannot support the proposal financially they 
[normal]are not opposed to it. Harrogate Borough Council is non committed. North Yorkshire County Council and Leeds Metro will not support the proposal this time as they claim there isn’t any possibility of reinstatement.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]£25m annual funding has been introduced f
[normal]or station reopening
[normal].
[normal] I would like to see the Chancellor, on recommendation from your Committee, approve £50m annually for reinstatement projects with a favourable BCR. This would reinstate 10-15 route miles annually.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Diesel and electric passenger units w
[normal]ill become surplus over the next decade due to cascade of 1146 carriages introduced by the Siemens Thameslink order and the recent rolling programme of electrification announced in the last two years. Most of these units, although at the bottom of the desi
[normal]rability pile, still have life in them. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to use these trains on reinstated local routes whilst we have them. Once scrapped this opportunity will be gone and 
[normal]probably never repeated. ROSCOs have already written down t
[normal]hese units and I am sure could be encouraged to continue leasing them at a knock down price as a gesture of goodwill instead of destroying an asset until reinstated routes become established.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Thank you for giving me the opportunity to submit this proposal
[normal].
