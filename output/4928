[normal]Wr[bold]itten evidence submitted by[bold] the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FDC19)[bold]1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]London Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) 
[normal]believes that the 
[normal]current devolutionary settlement can be best described as an improvement on having no city government whatsoever, but still incomplete and unsatisfactory.[bold]2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he business environment
[normal] in London can b
[normal]e improved
[normal] if local government is given a stake in economic growth through greater fiscal devolution
[normal].  We recommend
[normal]:
[normal]3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A
[normal]dditional funds raised through the 
[normal]retention of existing taxes should be off-set by a commensurate reduction in the overall cent
[normal]ral government grant to the GLA, so 
[normal]that 
[normal]any fiscal devolution to London will not negatively impact on the grant received by any other UK city or region. 
[normal]4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]LCCI
[normal]is the capital’s largest and most representative business organisation with 2,500 member companies from across Greater London. LCCI membership ranges from small
[normal]-
[normal] and medium
[normal]-sized
[normal] enterprises through to multi-national corporates. LCCI member compa
[normal]nies operate within a mix of sectors, across the 
[normal]Greater London area
[normal], genuinely reflecting the broad London business spectrum. 
[normal]5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Given the location of our membership base in London
[normal], this submission will only refer to the prospect of greater fiscal devolution to 
[normal]the capital
[normal]. 
[normal]We will mainly respond on the 
[normal]‘
[normal]details
[normal]’
[normal] of devolution rather than the 
[normal]‘
[normal]concept
[normal]’
[normal], since the institutions and geography of London governance are already 
[normal]understood
[normal]. 
[normal]6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, there is no reason why 
[normal]the principles
[normal] for additional fiscal powers for the capital could not be replicated 
[normal]to
[normal] other UK cities
[normal]; 
[normal]i
[normal]ndeed, 
[normal]g[bold]reater fiscal devolution to[bold], and the resulting economic growth of[bold],[bold] all[bold] [bold]core cities would be desirable[bold] for our members[bold], [bold]just as[bold] [bold]the growth of London benefits [bold]the rest of[bold] the UK[bold].[bold]7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The creation of the
[normal] 
[normal]GLA
[normal] as a strategic authority
[normal], the office of the Mayor of London and a 25 member Assembly with scrutiny powers
[normal] in 1999 has 
[normal]been overwhelmingly positive for London, Londoners and London businesses.
[normal] 
[normal]Successive Mayors have champion
[normal]ed
[normal] London in Whitehall
[normal] for a better financial settlement
[normal] and around the world in the search for foreign direct investment. The 
[normal]GLA
[normal] 
[normal]has been invaluable 
[normal]in highlighting where deficiencies exist in London’s services and infrastructure
[normal],
[normal] and how th
[normal]ese
[normal] could be hampering its competitiveness. 
[normal]8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]W
[normal]hile the ability to identify challenges, forecast increased demand and scope potential remedies has been useful, it is
[normal] 
[normal]regrettable 
[normal]that 
[normal]the GLA and London 
[normal]LAs
[normal] 
[normal]remain
[normal] powerless to act in the strategic interests of the capital. 
[normal]This inability stems from the fact 
[normal]the GLA and London local government have
[normal] 
[normal]little control over their revenues and are dependent on a grant from cen
[normal]tral government that is unpredictable and often set without consultation. 
[normal]9.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The lack of ownersh
[normal]ip over revenue streams 
[normal]results in
[normal] two 
[normal]deficiencies in
[normal] London governance 
[normal]that
[normal] hinder
[normal] economic
[normal] growth:
[normal]10.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Until [bold]these two issues are[bold] addressed, London’s current devolutionary settlement should be considered incomplete and unsatisfactory.[bold]11.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Until April 2013, there was no financial incentive for London government to 
[normal]encou
[normal]rage
[normal] economic growth as they were 
[normal]un
[normal]able to retain any growth in business rate yields. This means that local government policymakers are actively 
[normal]disincentivised from making decisions that will 
[normal]improve 
[normal]the
[normal] business environment if it comes into conflict with other interest groups 
[normal]that
[normal] are able to vote in local elections.
[normal]12.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Even after the Local Government Finance 
[normal]Act (2012
[normal])
[normal] introduced the B
[normal]usiness 
[normal]Rate R
[normal]ete
[normal]ntion Scheme
[normal] (BRRS)
[normal], councils only benefit if they perm
[normal]it new forms of physical growth in their area, placing 
[normal]LA
[normal]s (where there is little physical space to grow) at a disadvantage. The decision to exclude increases in rateable value from 
[normal]the BRRS
[normal] means that councils have no financial incentive to improve the ec
[normal]onomic viability of their area through improving community safety or investing in infrastructure or 
[normal]the public realm.
[normal] 
[normal]Even after reform, [bold]council incentives continue to be institutionally separated [bold]from the needs of business.[bold] 
[normal]13.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This was demonstrated by the L
[normal]CCI report 
[normal]Driving Local Growth: The Business Case
[normal], 
[normal]in which 
[normal] businesses were asked what should be the top priority for their local council and the top three responses were “investing in local infrastructure” (62% of respondents), “improving community saf
[normal]ety” (40%) and maintaining the built environment (35%).
[normal]14.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The same report found that just 12% of London businesses felt[bold] that[bold] their local council was aware of their needs as a business[bold]. If London 
[normal]LAs
[normal] (and the GLA) were 
[normal]given
[normal] a stake in the success of their local businesses through ownership and retention of 
[normal]100% of 
[normal]business rates, it is likely that engagement with the business community w
[normal]ould
[normal] improve, confidence in the local council w
[normal]ould
[normal] increase and more decisions made by l
[normal]ocal government w
[normal]ould
[normal] be positive for the local economy rather than 
[normal]direct
[normal]ed
[normal] at
[normal] the interests of a
[normal] small
[normal] group of 
[normal]residents
[normal].
[normal] Retaining and spending the taxes that most pay locally would improve accountability and transparency, remove complication and add n
[normal]o significant costs to the collection process.
[normal]15.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]dependence of the GLA and London 
[normal]LA
[normal]s on an unpredictable central government grant means that they are unable to raise the finance necessary to deliver the improvements in infrastruc
[normal]ture and public services because 
[normal]they are stripped of the ability to plan 
[normal]for
[normal] the future. Moreover, restrictions on borrowing beyond the existing prudential borrowing code prevent the GLA and London 
[normal]LA
[normal]s from independently financing major infrastructure pro
[normal]jects
[normal], leaving them reliant on the cooperation of 
[normal]HMT
[normal].
[normal]16.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]An e
[normal]xample of where this arrangement has 
[normal]severely 
[normal]hindered
[normal] essential infrastructure investment 
[normal]is
[normal] Crossrail. 
[normal]Proposals for a new link on the rough
[normal] 
[normal]axis of the current 
[normal]design
[normal] can be found in the Abercrombie plans for London of the 1940s. The earliest mention of the term “Crossrail” in LCCI archives 
[normal]is found in a
[normal] policy paper 
[normal]from
[normal] 1973. The term then appears in the London Rail Study of 1974
[normal] and the Central London Rail Study of
[normal] 1989
[normal]. A parliamentary bill to build the line fell at 
[normal]C
[normal]ommittee 
[normal]S
[normal]tage in the early 1990s
[normal]. 
[normal]A
[normal] Hybrid Bill was introduced to 
[normal]P
[normal]arliament
[normal] in 2005
[normal], receiving Royal Assent in 2008. Construction work began in mid-2009 but the project was
[normal] still at risk of being c
[normal]ancelled during the 2010 Comprehensive Spending Review
[normal] (CSR)
[normal]. It is now anticipated that the first trains will run on the line by 2018. 
[normal]Despite the years of prevarication from [bold]central government[bold], over 60% of the funding for the project will come from the G[bold]LA group, London [bold]LA[bold]s, London businesses and Londoners[bold].[bold]17.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There are also relevant international comparisons to be made between how the enhanced fiscal powers of London’s competitors have enabled better infrastructure planning and delivery: 
[normal]18.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Paris is not alone in the degree of its fiscal independence: 37% of Madrid’s income is dependent on 
[normal]central government grant, falling to 30.9% in New York, 25.5% in Berlin and 7.7% in Tokyo
[normal]. 
[normal]London, with 73.9% of its income dependent on central government, is an[bold] extreme[bold] outlier.[bold]19.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]London will have 1.6m extra residents by 2030
[normal] and over half a million new 
[normal]jobs
[normal],
[normal] yet its
[normal] ageing infrastructure is already struggling to cope with current population
[normal] demand
[normal]s
[normal], be it a shortage of affordable homes, overcrowded 
[normal]trains or slow br
[normal]oadband connections.
[normal] 
[normal]London cannot afford delay
[normal] 
[normal]in delivering 
[normal]the vital 
[normal]infrastructure projects 
[normal]to
[normal] ensure that the projected economic and demographic growth is sustainable
[normal]. 
[normal]20.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The efficient and cost-effective delivery of infrastructure can only be achieved if there is a known and credible pipeline of projects where finance has b
[normal]een guaranteed. 
[normal]T
[normal]he delivery of th
[normal]is
[normal] 
[normal]infrastructure 
[normal]will create jobs and distribute prosperity well beyond the GLA area 
[normal]–
[normal] 62% of businesses that won contracts for the construction of Crossrail are located outside of London
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]As long as London [bold]rema[bold]i[bold]n[bold]s so de[bold]pendent [bold]on [bold]central government grants[bold] for the majority of its income, [bold]this will not be possible.[bold]21.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The GLA and London local government[bold] should be able to retain[bold] 100% of[bold] the entire suite of [bold]property taxes ([bold]business[bold] rates, council tax, capital gains property development tax, stamp duty land tax and the annual tax of enveloped dwellings[bold])[bold] collected within the GLA area[bold].[bold] 
[normal]Property taxes 
[normal]are the most appropriate for 
[normal]devolution
[normal]. 
[normal]The
[normal] 
[normal]supply of property and land is slow to change, and this immobility creates a steady 
[normal]stream 
[normal]of revenue from the taxes collected.  
[normal]Furthermore, in
[normal] many cases, 
[normal]LA
[normal]s are already responsible for collecting them.
[normal]22.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]By devolving all property taxes rather than just o
[normal]ne element of them will remove the potential distorted incentives to 
[normal]prioritise
[normal] one type of development o
[normal]ver
[normal] another. If only Council Tax w
[normal]as
[normal] devolved, for example, it could lead to the prioritisation of housing over other type
[normal]s
[normal] of commercial development.
[normal]23.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]If fully devolved, it is estimated that[bold] property taxes could fund 50% of all current GLA and local council services[bold] and would replace the reliance on the ever fluctuating central government grant. This allows London governme
[normal]nt greater certainty o
[normal]ver
[normal] future
[normal] 
[normal]income
[normal],
[normal] enabling the timely and cost-effective delivery of infra
[normal]structure projects as well as providing 
[normal]the incentives to create a more competitive business environment in order to grow total 
[normal]tax 
[normal]yields.
[normal]24.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The full devolution of all property taxes opens up the possibility of the GLA, or even London 
[normal]LAs
[normal], being able to determine the rate, thresholds and exemptions of each. This c
[normal]ould
[normal] cause uncertainty for busines
[normal]ses
[normal]; 
[normal]without adequate safeguards, it is entirely possible that some local councils would look to “shake down” local businesses to increase their own revenue streams
[normal].
[normal] Moreover, businesses with multi
[normal]ple premises across in England and Wales 
[normal]might
[normal] face the add
[normal]ed complexity of paying different multipliers for different 
[normal]sites
[normal].
[normal]25.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, on balance, and with the right 
[normal]safeguards
[normal] and consultation with the business community, 
[normal]there is no reason for LCCI to oppose the GLA or London [bold]LA[bold]s being given [bold]the power to[bold] determi[bold]ne the rate, thresholds and exemptions of the taxes that they retain[bold] [bold]for the following reasons
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]26.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Key to delivering efficient and cost-effective infrastructure projects is the ability to secure sustainable finance 
[normal]in advance
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]If the GLA and London 
[normal]LA
[normal]s 
[normal]were
[normal] able to retain property taxes
[normal] 
[normal]and ha
[normal]d
[normal] a stake in creating 
[normal]the 
[normal]conditions to accelerate economic g
[normal]rowth, it 
[normal]would 
[normal]make sense to allow them to borrow against future projected growth in the tax receipts
[normal] from those 
[normal]investments
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]To enable this[bold], [bold]the [bold]fiscal devolution[bold] settlement [bold]should [bold]allow the GLA and London [bold]LAs[bold] to proceed with tax increment financing proj[bold]ects as long as they remain within the prudential borrowing code.[bold] 
[normal]The size of London’s economy (bigger than Sweden) and the unanimous verdict that it will continue to grow economically and demographically long into the future mean that it is able to suppor
[normal]t such a debt commitment.
[normal] 
[normal]27.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]B[bold]orrowing[bold] restrictions on the GLA group [bold]should be removed [bold]as long as borrowing remains within the prudential borrowing code. Given that London 
[normal]LA
[normal]s, unlike central government, cannot borrow money to supplement their revenue 
[normal]budgets,
[normal] no further restrictions on their ability to borrow should be applied.[bold]28.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]One of the greatest infrastructure needs for the capital over the coming years is providing enough 
[normal]affordable 
[normal]homes
[normal] for working Londoners
[normal]. By allowing the 
[normal]GLA and London 
[normal]LA
[normal]s to 
[normal]retain property taxes, there will be a certain stream of funding to 
[normal]enable
[normal] strategic investment to augment London’s housing stock. 
[normal]Further [bold]housing [bold]finance can be accessed if the artificial limit[bold] [bold]on what London [bold]LAs[bold] can borrow from Housing Revenue Accounts a[bold]re lifted[bold] (
[normal]as long as they continue
[normal] to remain within the prudential borrowing code). 
[normal]29.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The [bold]additional funding derived from the [bold]retention of all [bold]property taxes should be met by a commensurate reduction in the grant that the GLA and London [bold]LAs[bold] receive from the central government.[bold] This way, the impact of fiscal devolution 
[normal]would be
[normal] neutral for 
[normal]HMT
[normal] at the point of reform
[normal] and
[normal] 
[normal]would
[normal] not impact upon the settlements of other UK regions and cities.
[normal]30.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]o capture the improvements in governance listed above, 
[normal]t[bold]here will need to be a mechanism i[bold]n place so that the central government grant is not significantly [bold]cut[bold] after the initial reduction [bold]once[bold] fiscal devolution has taken place.[bold] If 
[normal]HMT
[normal] were to reduce the grant in line with increases in yields from devolved property taxes it would undermine the
[normal] f
[normal]inancial
[normal] incentives
[normal] for
[normal] the GLA and London 
[normal]LA
[normal]s 
[normal]to create a competitive business environment.
[normal] 
[normal]31.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]HMT will still be able to capture the proceeds of growth in London through the growth of income tax, value added tax and corporation tax and redistribute them as it sees fit. 
[normal]As these receipts for the whole of the UK add up to [bold]two-thirds[bold] of all HMT receipt[bold]s – compared to all UK property taxes which make up less than 10% -[bold] [bold]central government will continue to be the main beneficiar[bold]y[bold] of the future economic growth of London[bold].[bold]32.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There will also need to be a comprehensive review 
[normal]of
[normal] how the devolved money is split b
[normal]etween the GLA and London 
[normal]LA
[normal]s and between the 
[normal]LA
[normal]s themselves
[normal] (and to what extent locally set property taxes are retained or redistributed)
[normal]. In our view
