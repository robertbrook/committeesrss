[[[Written evidence submitted by LGC (FSS020)]]]Does the Government have an effective strategy for forensic science in the UK and is it sufficient to support forensic science R&amp;D and criminal justice?1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; One of the stated goals of the Government-led Forensic Transition Board, that oversaw the wind-down of the FSS, was to create a healthy competitive market for forensic science in England and Wales.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In our view, a healthy competitive market would have the following characteristics:3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Despite the recent establishment of a Government-led Forensic Science Policy Group, the current strategy for forensic science is unclear to us.  In practice, since the wind-down of the FSS, individual police forces are making their own decisions on their strategy, leading to a fragmented approach across the country, with fewer contracts being outsourced to private companies and a greater proportion of forensics being undertaken by “in-house” police laboratories.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This shift to in-house analysis has significantly reduced the market for outsourced forensic science.  Whilst the private sector has shown that it will invest in R&amp;D (for example LGC invested c. £3.5m in 2012), where there is a potential return on the investment, the size of the available market is one determinant of that potential return, and so a shrinking and fragmented market is likely to reduce overall R&amp;D spending.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The historic investment in R&amp;D by the FSS was paid for by its owner, the Government. In the current economic climate, a mix of government and private investment will be necessary if levels of R&amp;D spend are to be maintained.  Did the FSS transition and closure run smoothly and within budget?6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Although we cannot comment on the internal or financial aspects of the wind-down, LGC was actively involved in parts of the transition of work from the FSS.7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The work carried out at the 4 main FSS laboratories was transferred in 4 tranches, according to the specific customers’ requirements8.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Due to the significant volume of work undertaken at the FSS Lambeth laboratory, this approach, whilst pragmatic, has had the effect of significantly reducing the size of the outsourced market.  9.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In addition, due to the short duration of the contracts associated with the transfers, the tender timetable has now been compressed such that almost 45% of the market has been re-tendered with effect from 1 April 2013.  To put this in perspective, this is larger than the entire transfer of work that resulted from the FSS wind-down and transfer to outsourced providers.10.&#xa0; From LGC’s perspective, the transfer of work from the FSS was challenging, but ran without any major negative impact on the criminal justice system.  A shortage of qualified casework toxicologists meant that this specialist area was the most affected, with turnaround times increasing from the standard 28 days to a maximum of 56 days during the summer of 2012. This was managed closely with the NPIA, CPS and forces in order to minimise the effect on court schedules. Turnaround times have now returned to normal levels.11.&#xa0; The North East SLA was awarded to LGC and was fulfilled by our setting up a new laboratory in the West Yorkshire Police Scientific Support facility in Wakefield, and recruiting and training 55 ex-FSS staff in a 6 week period. As a result, the transition was completed on time, rapidly delivering the majority of the contracted service levels, and has become a pilot for a new partnership model for forensic science provision.What impacts have the FSS’s closure had on (i) the criminal justice system and (ii) forensic science R&amp;D and training? In particular, have the appropriate quality standards and accreditation been rigorously maintained? (please provide evidence/examples)12.&#xa0; We do not believe that the FSS closure in itself has had any adverse effect on the criminal justice system. Commercial providers cover the same range of services to the same contracted service and quality levels.13.&#xa0; The FSS R&amp;D portfolio was put out to tender as part of the wind-down process. LGC acquired the IP related to a software package developed to automate the interpretation of complex DNA profiles. We also employed part of the software team to continue its development. 14.&#xa0; In the two years since the announcement of the closure of the FSS, LGC has invested over £10 million in new laboratories, instrumentation, information technology, training and R&amp;D (including technology designed to speed up DNA analysis and hence the identification of offenders).15.&#xa0; All commercial providers carry out rigorous training programs for their own staff and in some cases for third parties (such as the Police and other agencies), and did not rely on the FSS.16.&#xa0; LGC and other commercial providers are all required to work under the same international standard of quality and accreditation (ISO 17025), as well as to comply with the Forensic Regulator’s Codes of Practice. The FSS closure has had no effect on this - the Regulator has continued to confirm his full confidence in the LGC quality regime. 17.&#xa0; The in-sourcing of forensics work to police laboratories (an existing trend, exacerbated by the closure of the FSS) has resulted in a greater proportion of UK forensic science being carried out in laboratories that are not yet accredited.What should be role of the Forensic Science Regulator?18.&#xa0; The Forensic Science Regulator’s role is to set and maintain quality standards for the provision of forensic science in England and Wales. He has published Codes of Practice that specify the standards required of those performing forensic science for the criminal justice system.19.&#xa0; In our view, the role of the Regulator is appropriate, and the Codes of Practice adequate to ensure the appropriate level of quality in the provision of forensic science.  However the Regulator currently has no statutory powers to enforce compliance with these Codes. We continue to believe that he should be given these powers.20.&#xa0; Commercial providers have worked to the required quality standards for several years, as they are required to do  according to their contracts with police forces. However, there is no current requirement for non-commercial or defence providers to comply with the same standards. The regulator announced in 2010 that compliance (other than for digital data and fingerprint recovery) would be required of all labs undertaking forensic analysis for the criminal justice system (CJS) by October 2013.  However, since the Regulator has no statutory power, we believe it is likely that this deadline will not be met by all laboratories. We consider it essential for public confidence in the CJS, and for the proper evaluation of the cost of in-sourced forensic science, that all forensic laboratories should be required to operate to the same high standards.What is the size of the forensics market and how stable is it?21.&#xa0; The wind down of the FSS, and the trend for police forces to in-source forensics work, has led to a period of radical change. We estimate that the size of the forensics market, outside the work police do themselves, has fallen from c. £155m in 2010 to £70-80m in 2012. We foresee continued decline as budgets are reduced and forces continue to take work in-house.22.&#xa0; This reduced size of market is not large enough to attract a significant number of well-capitalized competitors; the operation of forensic science laboratories carries with it a significant element of “fixed cost” (for example equipment, accreditation and training) and a certain minimum level of work is necessary to ensure a return.  In our view the current supplier base provides more than enough capacity for the current size of the out-sourced market. 23.&#xa0; We believe that the value, contribution and efficiency of forensic science should be measured from crime scene to court and that the spending should be commensurate with its overall value in deterring and detecting crime and, once detected, securing convictions, particularly through early guilty pleas.  24.&#xa0; In a study by the NPIA, it was shown that, for every 10 crimes detected using forensic DNA profiling, 8 previous crimes were linked to these and 7 future crimes are prevented.  In a separate study by the ACPO Homicide working group, it was demonstrated that forensic science was a significant contributor to solving 60% of homicides.  A study by CIL, commissioned by LGC, highlighted that where DNA evidence is used, the proportion of guilty pleas rises from 66% to 89%.  On average a guilty plea reduces the time for a court hearing by 90%.How are forensic science services procured by police forces and could procurement processes be improved?25.&#xa0; Since 2008, Police Forces have procured most forensic services by tendering their work according to a National Framework Agreement, coordinated by the NPIA (now the Home Office Forensic Market Management Team).26.&#xa0; The framework specifies a “menu” of tightly defined work packages, called Service Codes, which are individually priced. Police forensic teams submit items to providers along with the service codes to apply to them.27.&#xa0; Contracts awarded under the National Framework are typically 2-3 years in duration.28.&#xa0; Whilst the introduction of the National Framework has given forces a number of advantages, including lower pricing for outsourced work and greater control over spending, it has also had the effect of commoditising forensic science and creating a transactional customer/supplier relationship, rather than a partnership approach to crime solving.29.&#xa0; In our view, a better way forward is to adopt a partnership model of forensic provision, where customers and suppliers work together to make the entire workflow of forensic science, from crime scene to court, more efficient and cost effective.30.&#xa0; One way to do this is a “managed service” approach (as currently operated in the North East Region), where a provider dedicates a team and/or laboratory to a force or region with the express aim of working closely with the police team to streamline processes and improve outcomes. The “managed service” or “partnership” approach provides, inter alia, greater flexibility to deal with changes in force priorities, joint strategy setting on individual cases, the potential for outcome based performance measures, and lower administration costs for both customer and supplier.  Such contracts would necessarily be longer in duration, 5 years or more, in order to realise the benefits.&#xa0;Has the closure of the FSS resulted in a loss of intellectual wealth through its scientists leaving the forensic science profession, or the UK? (please provide evidence/examples)31.&#xa0; The wind-down of the FSS was inevitably going to bring considerable change to the sector as a whole, and there is little doubt that some scientists took the opportunity to leave the profession and move to other areas of science. However some parts of the sector did recruit (principally in-sourced police forensic operations) and the commercial sector grew in the aftermath of the FSS wind-down (to accommodate the sudden influx of work).  As has already been indicated, the commercial sector is now contracting again as further contracts are in-sourced by police forces. 32.&#xa0; LGC, like other providers, hired a large number of ex-FSS staff during the transition period. However, the reduction in the size of the out-sourced market to around half the level in 2010 has made it inevitable that supplier capacity (and hence employment) must also reduce. 33.&#xa0; This does not necessarily mean a loss of “intellectual wealth” – for example our own recently announced plans to concentrate our expertise by centralising some of our operations will mean the loss of 150-170 posts, but will not in any way reduce the quality or capability of our operation.  Even after these changes, our head count will still be above what it was before the FSS was wound down and our specialised teams – such as those who handled the Lawrence, Taylor and Nickell cases - will remain part of our operation.  Such rapid reaction to the changing demands of the out-sourced market is essential if private sector providers are to remain profitable and hence able to invest in R&amp;D.34.&#xa0; Some suppliers (including LGC) offer forensic services alongside other scientific analysis services.  In these cases, there is considerable potential to utilise this broader range of capability to enrich the forensic service offering to the benefit of the criminal justice system.Are current arrangements for the FSS’s archives satisfactory? How could arrangements for the retention of case files and forensic materials in the UK be improved?35.&#xa0; We have concerns that the Archive now has only limited functionality since some of the information contained within it is no longer accessible by archive staff, for example electronic information such as spreadsheets, and certain reports from the FSS case management system.  The referencing system for cases makes the identification of material very difficult unless the old FSS case reference number is known.  There are a number of other issues with current arrangements, some of which we believe could be addressed relatively easily.

[[[DECLARATION OF INTEREST]]]

[[[LGC and LGC Forensics]]]&#xa0;36.&#xa0; LGC was founded almost 170 years ago as the Laboratory of the Government Chemist. It was privatised in 1996 and has since grown to become an international science-based company and market leader in forensic, analytical and diagnostic services and reference standards. LGC operates internationally through five divisions—LGC Forensics, LGC Standards, LGC Genomics, LGC Health Sciences and LGC Science &amp; Technology. LGC is headquartered in London and employs over 1,800 staff in 36 laboratories and centres across Europe, India, China and the USA.&#xa0;37.&#xa0; LGC Forensics has been operating in the forensic science market since 1991 and has grown to become the largest independent provider of forensic science services to police forces and other law enforcement agencies in the UK, with c.700 staff working across eight facilities. LGC Forensics is a full service provider, being approved to tender for work under each of the 14 different lot areas in the National Forensics Framework Agreement (“NFFA”), under which tenders for forensic services are made.&#xa0;38.&#xa0; LGC Forensics’ technical capability extends across the full breadth and depth of forensic science services, from high throughput analytical tests (such as DNA profiling and drug identifications), to complex casework involving hundreds of exhibits, to specialisms such as ballistics and digital and document &#xa0;39.&#xa0; LGC Forensics has a wide breadth of customers: we have worked with every police force in the UK as well as UK Government agencies including MoD, DWP and HMRC, while internationally we have worked with a range of overseas governments and law enforcement agencies. &#xa0;40.&#xa0; The forensic science market is only one of a number of areas where LGC provides scientific support to the UK Government. Through our Science &amp; Technology Division, for example, we are the UK’s designated National Measurement Institute for chemical and biochemical analysis, the National Reference Laboratory for a range of key areas, and also the host organisation for the UK’s Government Chemist function. &#xa0;January 2013
