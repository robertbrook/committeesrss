[[[The extent of the trade and keeping of primates as pets within the UK]]]&#xa0;It has been estimated that 2500-7500 primates are being kept by private individuals in the UK as pets (Soulsbury et al., 2009). However given that markets for legal trade are inextricably linked to illegal trade, indeed the legal trade can be a driver of the illegal trade, the numbers being traded and kept is likely to be significantly underestimated. &#xa0;Ref: Soulsbury C.D., Iossa G., Kennell S. &amp; Harris S.

[[[?]]]&#xa0;The UK requires primate species listed under the Dangerous Wild Animals Act (1976) to be licensed, although recent changes to the lists have reduced the number of species for which a licence is required, undermining protection to many primate species. &#xa0;Whilst not directly related to this question it is important for the Commons Select Committee to understand that illegal trade in wildlife has been strongly linked to other criminal activities such as the trafficking of weapons and drugs, and terrorism. In November 2012, then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that illegal wildlife trade must be addressed at every level of the international community and declared illegal wildlife trade a national security issue. In May 2013, the UN Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice agreed to a resolution calling on the nations of the world to consider wildlife and forest crime a serious form of organised crime. Also in a May 2013 report to the United Nations Security Council, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon highlighted the potential link between poaching and other transnational organised criminal activities. Therefore any system that purports to manage legal trade, a trade that is a driver for illegal trade, must ensure its’ systems are applied and effective. The existing regulatory framework and Code of Practice not only provides inadequate protection for primates, it is also not effectively implemented; RSPCA research on the DEFRA ‘Code of Practice for the Welfare of Privately Kept Non-Human Primates’ found that many English local authorities are either unaware of the Code, or don't use it. &#xa0;

[[[be allowed to keep primates as pets and, if not, how a ban might be implemented.]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]A wealth of evidence, supported by experts in primate health and welfare reject the view that primates can be kept as pets. Primatologists, conservationists, zoo professionals, veterinarians, primate rescue organisations and other respected professionals support restricting the keeping of primates to those with highly specialised knowledge, skills and facilities appropriate to the species, and only for purposes of conservation or sanctuary. Primates are highly intelligent animals with complex needs that can't be met in a home environment and can suffer greatly. There is considerable evidence to suggest that many keepers of pet primates lack the appropriate knowledge and/or facilities to adequately provide for their welfare. Soulsbury et al., 2009 in their scientific assessment of the suitability of primates as pets in the UK concluded that the practice should end. Over half of all incidents involving primates reported to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in the UK between 2001-2008, involved species for which a license is not required, and over 60% involved primates housed on their own. One UK sanctuary reports that all of the primates transferred to them from private keepers are suffering from either physical or behavioural problems (or both) including stereotypic behaviours. Many exhibit a tendency to exhibit self-harming behaviour. &#xa0;Therefore we should be focusing on the second part of the question, how should a ban be implemented. Clearly given the large number of primates in private ownership, professional facilities would be overwhelmed and unable to cope with an immediate ban. A more practical approach would be to have a ban with a grandfather clause which would allow current private owners that are adhering to the Animal Welfare Act (2006) to keep their (non-breeding) primates. This approach would stop the trade, phase out private keeping of primates as pets, and allow the worst cases, those that are not being kept according to the Animal Welfare Act (2006), to find sanctuary in a suitable and professionally run facility. &#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;&#xa0;
