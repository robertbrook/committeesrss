[normal]AFS0098[bold]Written evidence submitted by [bold]Mr. and Mrs. C. Jones[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Concerns arising from our observations of the setting up of Route 39 Academy in 
[normal]North Devon
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]"Evidence of demand" is required, but it seems that the evidence submitted to the DoE and the EFA by a prospective 
[normal]Free
[normal] 
[normal]School
[normal] is accepted at face value. No attempt is made to scrutinise how the evidence is obtained.
[normal](in the case of R39, e[bold]vidence of demand was apparently obtained at open days held at a local theme park and via a website survey managed by R39 themselves)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The governors of a prospective 
[normal]Free
[normal] 
[normal]School
[normal] are expected to undertak
[normal]e a programme of consultation with the local community, but there appears to be no attempt made by the DoE to ensure that this is not just a box-ticking exercise. Again, results of these consultations appear to be accepted at face-value - there is no forma
[normal]l opportunity for local opposition groups to voice their concerns.
[normal](in the case of R39, all attempts by a local opposition group to engage with the governors and discuss important issues were declined, including one occasion when R39 cancelled a presentati[bold]on they were due to give to a parish council meeting when an opposition group was also granted permission to make a presentation)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]It would appear that the EFA can approve funding for a 
[normal]Free
[normal] 
[normal]School
[normal] even b
[normal]efore planning permission is granted for the school to be built. This leads to the suspicion that the DoE would intervene if permission is refused by local planning committees.
[normal](in the case of R39, funding has been approved in spite of the fact that planni[bold]ng permission for a temporary site was refused - the planning application for the permanent site has still not been submitted)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The EFA is happy to fund Free Schools in areas where there is n
[normal]o shortage of school places.
[normal](in the case of R39, the governors maintain that competition is good and will raise standards across all schools, and yet they have struggled to fill their places and the 4 existing state secondary schools in the area have all [bold]lost a few pupils) [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Our concern about the 
[normal]academies
[normal] programme 
[normal]is that
[normal] it is possible for
[normal] funding for a free school 
[normal]to
[normal] be approved with very little evidence of demand for the school, 
[normal]with little or no public consultation and without planning permission first being granted for the proposed site. Furthermore, not enough consideration 
[normal]is given to
[normal] 
[normal]the impact on other schools in the area.
