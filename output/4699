defaultAFS0098defaultWritten evidence submitted by defaultMr. and Mrs. C. Jonesdefault&#xa0;
defaultConcerns arising from our observations of the setting up of Route 39 Academy in 
defaultNorth Devon
default:
default&#xa0;
default"Evidence of demand" is required, but it seems that the evidence submitted to the DoE and the EFA by a prospective 
defaultFree
default 
defaultSchool
default is accepted at face value. No attempt is made to scrutinise how the evidence is obtained.
default(in the case of R39, edefaultvidence of demand was apparently obtained at open days held at a local theme park and via a website survey managed by R39 themselves)default&#xa0;
defaultThe governors of a prospective 
defaultFree
default 
defaultSchool
default are expected to undertak
defaulte a programme of consultation with the local community, but there appears to be no attempt made by the DoE to ensure that this is not just a box-ticking exercise. Again, results of these consultations appear to be accepted at face-value - there is no forma
defaultl opportunity for local opposition groups to voice their concerns.
default(in the case of R39, all attempts by a local opposition group to engage with the governors and discuss important issues were declined, including one occasion when R39 cancelled a presentatidefaulton they were due to give to a parish council meeting when an opposition group was also granted permission to make a presentation)default&#xa0;
defaultIt would appear that the EFA can approve funding for a 
defaultFree
default 
defaultSchool
default even b
defaultefore planning permission is granted for the school to be built. This leads to the suspicion that the DoE would intervene if permission is refused by local planning committees.
default(in the case of R39, funding has been approved in spite of the fact that plannidefaultng permission for a temporary site was refused - the planning application for the permanent site has still not been submitted)default&#xa0;
defaultThe EFA is happy to fund Free Schools in areas where there is n
defaulto shortage of school places.
default(in the case of R39, the governors maintain that competition is good and will raise standards across all schools, and yet they have struggled to fill their places and the 4 existing state secondary schools in the area have all defaultlost a few pupils) default&#xa0;
defaultOur concern about the 
defaultacademies
default programme 
defaultis that
default it is possible for
default funding for a free school 
defaultto
default be approved with very little evidence of demand for the school, 
defaultwith little or no public consultation and without planning permission first being granted for the proposed site. Furthermore, not enough consideration 
defaultis given to
default 
defaultthe impact on other schools in the area.
