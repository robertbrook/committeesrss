defaultWe received the notification of the Transport Committee’s inquiry into ‘Passenger Transport in Isolated Communities’.
default&#xa0;
default You may be aware that the Scottish Parliament’s Infrastructure &amp; Capital Investment Committee recently held an inquiry into community transport.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs part of our campaign, Still Waiting, Age Scotland has been lobbying for a review of the existing National Concessionary Travel scheme in order that this is made more widely available on community transport services.
default&#xa0;
default We submitted evidence to the Infrastructure &amp; Capital Investment Committee and, while we are aware that transport in Scotland is a devolved matter, we hoped that the findings of our research and the key questions which it raises may be of interest in your own investigation.
default&#xa0;
defaultA copy of Age Scotland’s submission to the Infrastructure &amp; Capital Investment Committee’s inquiry is available here.
default&#xa0;
defaultIf you have any questions in relation to this or would like additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.
