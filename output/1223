[normal]We received the notification of the Transport Committee’s inquiry into ‘Passenger Transport in Isolated Communities’.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] You may be aware that the Scottish Parliament’s Infrastructure &amp; Capital Investment Committee recently held an inquiry into community transport.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As part of our campaign, Still Waiting, Age Scotland has been lobbying for a review of the existing National Concessionary Travel scheme in order that this is made more widely available on community transport services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] We submitted evidence to the Infrastructure &amp; Capital Investment Committee and, while we are aware that transport in Scotland is a devolved matter, we hoped that the findings of our research and the key questions which it raises may be of interest in your own investigation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A copy of Age Scotland’s submission to the Infrastructure &amp; Capital Investment Committee’s inquiry is available here.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If you have any questions in relation to this or would like additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.
