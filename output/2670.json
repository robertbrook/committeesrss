"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nGreenSpeed\n (SRN\n \n001)\n&#xa0;1.               Introduction&#xa0;1.01\n              \nGreenSpeed\n was set up in response to the reduced speed limit imposed on coaches that \nincreased\n \nthe \ncompetitive advantage \nheld by the car\n on trunk roads and motorways. It has campaigned for a greater reduction in the speed limit for cars to return the competitive advantage to coaches \n(\nand trains\n)\n. \nT\nhe contents of “Action for Roads\"\n \nfails to\n address this issue and \nthe priority \nfor the Select Committee should be to seek ways in which \nto provide a reliable, integrated and low carbon transport system.\n&#xa0;\n1.02\n              \nIn 2005/6 the\n Environmental Audit \nSelect \nCommittee investigated “Reducing Carbon Emissions from Transport\". At paragraph 82 the EAC concluded that, \n“\nW\ne understand the \nG\novernment's reluctance to lower the mo\ntorway speed limit, or rigo\nrously enforce the current 70 mph limit, given the likely public\n controversy such a policy would provoke. However, compared to the potential danger which this could help to avert, proper enforcement of the legal speed limit would be a trivial incursion on personal liberty. The \nG\novernment cannot forever duck the harsh d\necisions in its duties to face up to “the greatest long-term challenge facing the human race\", in the words of the Prime Minister. In matters of such grave importance, the \nG\novernment does a disservice to future generations by running scared of critical tab\nloid headlines. Beyond its direct impact, a new policy on speed limits would help to raise awareness of the reality of climate change, and of the need \nfor\n everyone t\no take action on it.”\n&#xa0;\n1.03\n              \nThe \nEAC\n had considered the VIBAT study commissioned by the Depa\nrtment for Transport which recommended a reduction in the national speed limit to 50 mph. This was supported by the UKERC recommendation of a 60 mph limit (Quick Hits 2006), and similar proposals by the King Review\n, \nthe\n European Energy Commissioner\n and the\n Committee on Climate Change.  It is probably safe to say that there is no evidence that\n carbon emissions from transport can be reduced in accordance with the Climate Change Act 2008 without reducing the national speed limit.\n&#xa0;\n1.04\n              \nThe main reason why the \nGovernment has refused to act on this matter is the reduction in fuel duty that successive Chancellors have refused to contemplate.\n&#xa0;\n1.05\n              \nThere have been 2 important changes in circumstances since 2006 that would make the EAC recommendation even more relev\nant to the current considerations by the Transport Select Committee.  Carbon emissions have continued to increase with no sign that the Department for Transport (including “Action for Roads”) has any effective policy to meet \nin \nthe\n short, medium or long\ner\n term. The only measure to appear in Action for Roads is the reliance on Ultra Low Emission Vehicles (ULEVs).  Notwithstanding the doubts about such vehicles becoming commonplace \nor that\n their actual carbon footprints\n are significantly lower than modern IC\nEs\n, this Government \npolicy implies an even greater loss of revenue from fuel duty, than would a 50-60 mph national speed limit. In fact, a lower speed limit would be one of the greatest possible incentives for the use \nof  ULEVs\n as a speed of around 50 mph \nwould \nmaximise\n their range\n (range being one of the key limitations)\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n1.06\n              \nIt should be noted \nby the Transport Select Committee \nthat the following comments were made in the context of the Cook Review of the Strategic Road Network and have been made consis\ntently throughout the last 15 years. \nTo date, t\nhe response \nto the proposal to reduce the national speed limit \nhas been the same as that of the Government to the recommendation of the EAC.\n&#xa0;\n2.              How will the policies set out in the Government's “Action for Roads\" improve the strategic road network for all road users, whilst also improving the environment?&#xa0;\n2.01\n              \n \nThe simple answer to this question is that it should be asked only when the full impact of a reduced speed limit on the whole transport system has \nbeen properly assessed. The Department for Transport has consistently and repeatedly refused to carry out a Strategic Environmental Assessment into the impact of a reduction in the national speed limit. Given the l\nikely benefits in terms of the \nreduction i\nn congestion arising from the substantial increase \nof\n the efficien\ncy in\n use of both roads and junctions that would be achieved through a reduction in the national speed limit, until this has been properly assessed, it is irresponsible to consider the benef\nits\n of more motorway lanes.\n \n The Department for Transport is fully aware of the benefit\ns\n of lower speeds (these are introduced on motorways at the same time as hard shoulders are made availa\nble with reduced journey times, \nreduce\nd\n accidents and reduced cong\nestion). \n&#xa0;\n2.02\n              \nHowever, these variable speed limits do not represent the \nsystemic approach to capacity, safety and\n&#xa0;\n environmental\n sustainability\n that is urgently required. \n&#xa0;\nVariable speed limits do not sit in the virtuous circle that would include a power\n shift to more efficient vehicles and a modal shift to lower carbon means of transport.\n&#xa0;\n2.03\n              \nAction for Roads refers to \nboth \ncompetitiveness and international examples. In this context it should acknowledge that \na \nsignificant number of freight \nhauliers\n ch\noose to restrict the speed of their vehicles to less than the national speed limits in order to save fuel. Reference should also be made to the fact that in Japan, Canada and Norway the national speed limit is alread\ny 100kph or 62\nmph.\n  \n&#xa0;\n2.04\n              \nThe Department of Transport has attempted to \nassess the cost to business of \na reduction in the national speed limit. However, this calculation has not taken into account the consequential reduction in congestion currently costing in the area of £20 billion\n. RTAs \nare more frequent and serious at higher (and differential) speeds and place \na significant financial burden on all the emergency services and the NHS\n.\n \nBusiness would quickly adjust to a lower speed limit and benefit from more reliable journey times.\n&#xa0;\n2.05\n              \nA\n reduction in the national speed limit have substantial environmental, \nsocial and economic benefits compatible if not exceeding those anticipated by the £15 billion projected spend proposed in the Action for Roads, but this simple change in \nregulation could be done immediately, at virtually no public cost and would be entirely equitable. Unlike the proposal to increase road capacity\n&#xa0;\nthrough building, achieving this through a reduction in speed engages the \n‘\nconstant time budget\n’\n that would red\nuce or eliminate the ‘rebound effect’. The reluctance to spend a great\ner\n time in travelling would reduce the inclination to\n invest savings in money in travelling further. \nRoad capacity increased in order to enable high speed driving quickly fills up. \n&#xa0;\n2.06\n              \nAction for Roads\n \nproposes an, ‘…\naggressive policy of decarbonisation, to address the carbon consequences of motoring and move us to a lower-impact \nf\nuture\n.’\n If that were true\n, \nthe question must be asked as to why \nthe Command Paper \nc\nompletely fails to a\nddress the \nissue of ‘speed’ that \nthe \nDfT\n know to be\n the most effective measure to reduce the \nenvironmental \nimpact\ns\n of \nroad transport,\n including the overall carbon emissions.\n&#xa0;\n2.07\n              \nIn summary, the proposals would encourage greater more intensive use of an e\nnlarged strategic road network. What is required is the more efficient use of the network as it stands that would involve a modal shift (and power-shift) to more sustainable and lower carbon modes of travel.\n&#xa0;3.              How does the Government's policy for roads link with planning for other transport modes?&#xa0;3.01\n              \nIt should be through a reduction in the national speed limit that the Government could achieve an integrated and reliable transport system depending more on the lower carbon modes of bus, coach and rail.\nIncidentally, \na \nreduction in the 70 mph limit (commonly enforced at 85 mph) would \nincentivise\n the development of smaller and more efficient vehicles that would be less polluting at lower speeds (e.g. 20 mph) suitable for urban areas.\n&#xa0;4.              How can we improve the reliability and efficiency of travel on the strategic road network, what impact will new technology have?&#xa0;4.01\n              \n‘\nReliability\n’\n and \n‘\nefficiency\n’\n are \ntwo\n of the\n main characteristics of lower speeds. Increasing capacity through road building could, in the short term, increase reliability but would not increase efficiency. Insofar as road pricing could be part of a package of new technologies to apply to the strate\ngic road network,\n this has serious disadvantages in terms of equity (and significant \ncosts and \npublic hostility). It would be irresponsible to introduce road pricing before the effects of a lower speed limit had been fully assessed, particularly on levels \nof congestion.\n&#xa0;\n5.              Summary&#xa0;5.01\n              \nThe \nvery sensible \nquestions being posed by the Transport Select Committee Imply that it is most interested in the systemic effects of the \nproposals in Action for Roads. This is obviously the right approach when considering \ninterventions (including substantial public investment) in the transport system. Unfortunately, the quickest, cheapest, fairest and most effective intervention would be the reduction in the national speed limit that has not been considered in this or any o\nther Command Paper.  This is an omission that the \nT\nransport \nC\nommittee could seek to remedy.\n&#xa0;\n5.02\n              \nThere is already substantial evidence; the VIBAT study, UKERC, CE Delft\n, that a lower speed limit would meet all the objectives being sought by the Action on \nRoads.  The \nDfT\n should be required to conduct a Strategic Environmental Assessment to compare the \nbenefits, costs and synergies of the alternative means of both managing demand and increasing capacity on the road (and wider transport network), before publi\nc money is spent on a road Building/widening programme. \n&#xa0;\n5.03\n              \nIn 2006 The EAC failed to persuade the Government that speed was crucial to reducing carbon emissions.  \nThe \nDfT\n is aware of the connection between speed and carbon emissions, \nif  not\n the wider \nsystemic and gener\nally beneficial effects.  One o\nf these wider effects is what \nthe EAC saw as a potential ‘game changer’, \nthe \nbring\ning\n home to the general public \nof \nthe obligation to reduce our carbon emissions.  \nIf the EAC was right, t\nhe inaction by Gover\nnment on this issue \nis sending the contrary\n message\n,\n that \nthe reduction in carbon is not a priority.\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;1\n&#xa0;\n"
