defaultDraft Deregulation Billdefault&#xa0;
defaultThank you for your letter of 19 August on behalf of the Joint Committee on the draft Deregulation Bill seeking the Justice Committee’s views on relevant provisions of the draft bill.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Justice Committee offers the following comments on clauses 35 to 39 of the draft bill:
default&#xa0;
defaultClause 35default&#xa0;
defaultThis clause removes the legal duty imposed on the Senior President of Tribunals to make an annual report to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions on the standards of decision-making achieved by the Department of Work and Pensions in the making of decisions against which an appeal lies to the First-tier Tribunal.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe effect of this provision is straightforward. However, it comes against a background of disapprobatory reports published by the Senior President of Tribunals on the standards achieved by the Department of Work and pensions and the company that carries out fitness to work assessments, 
defaultAtos
default. His Honour Judge Martin noted in evidence to the Commons Work and Pensions Committee that “the same problems and errors are repeated year after year, with no sign that anyone takes any notice of feedbacks from Tribunals ...” His concerns are borne out by the high number of successful appeals against DWP decisions to grant benefits based on 
defaultAtos
default assessments, almost half of all cases brought to court. 
default&#xa0;
defaultA Commons written answer of 18 October 2013 gave the Government’s reasons for the proposed repeal of the Senior President’s report duty:

default&#xa0;
defaultThe Joint Committee may wish to ask the Senior President of Tribunals for his opinion on the value of his annual report and whether he supports the abolition of the duty to make such a report. 
default&#xa0;
defaultClause 36 default&#xa0;
defaultThis clause amends the law with regard to witness statements and other matters of evidence in a criminal trial by repealing the statutory provisions and replacing them with a power by the Criminal 
defaultProcedure Rule Committee to replace them with Rules. The previous statutory provisions are the
default&#xa0;
default'default' position until the
default&#xa0;
defaultCriminal Procedure Rule Committee
default&#xa0;
defaultprovides otherwise. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Explanatory Notes envisage that the Criminal Procedure Rule Committee will use its new powers to streamline court procedures while ensuring "the rules provide appropriate safeguards for defendants..."
default&#xa0;
defaultThis would also permit consolidation of
default&#xa0;
defaultmatters of procedure in the criminal courts. On that basis,
default&#xa0;
defaultthis measure is to be welcomed.
default&#xa0;
defaultTogether with clauses 37 and 38, however, it is suggested that the Joint Committee may wish to ask the Criminal Procedure Rule Committee whether it welcomes these provisions. If the Criminal Procedure Rule Committee is likely to simply
default&#xa0;
defaultsubstitute these statutory provisions with identical Rules then it must be queried whether inclusion of these clauses in legislation represents a good use of Parliamentary time. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultClause 37 default&#xa0;
defaultThis clause amends section 12(7) of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 to provide that the Criminal Procedure Rules may dispense with the requirement
default&#xa0;
defaultthat the statement of facts, any notice served on the defendant, the guilty plea by the defendant and any written statements given in mitigation
default&#xa0;
defaultmust be read aloud in court before that court may accept
default&#xa0;
defaulta written
default&#xa0;
defaultguilty plea without the defendant being present.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis clause is intended to speed up the process of guilty pleas in the Magistrates' Court for comparatively minor offences such as minor road traffic offences.
default&#xa0;
defaultClearly any measure that seeks to save court time is welcome. The only caveat would be that this measure reduces the public nature of justice in these cases. However, as the provision merely allows the Criminal Procedure Rule Committee to adopt this approach, presumably after the usual consultation and consideration, this measure can also be welcomed in principle. 
default&#xa0;
defaultClause 38 default&#xa0;
defaultIn all but one instance, this
default&#xa0;
defaultclause seeks to give the Criminal Procedure Rule Committee power to make Criminal Procedure Rules in areas where no statutory procedure applies.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe exception is the removal of notice requirements for warrants for "excluded or special procedure material" in Schedule 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Unlike the clauses detailed above, the draft bill does not leave the current statutory procedure as the 'default'
default&#xa0;
defaultposition,
default it repeals the provisions and
default&#xa0;
defaultgives the Criminal Procedure Rule Committee power to create a new
default&#xa0;
defaultprocedure in future. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Explanatory Notes do not explain why the notice provisions in Schedule 1 of PACE are being repealed without leaving anything in their place. It is suggested the Government are asked what
default&#xa0;
defaultits rationale is for this approach. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultClause 38 also requires, in two instances, under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and the Criminal Justice and Police Act 
default2001, that
default the Criminal Procedure Rule Committee apply to a judge when stating procedure in the relevant proceedings. It is suggested the Government is asked why there is this difference of approach between these provisions and the others detailed in this draft bill.
default&#xa0;
defaultClause 39 default&#xa0;
defaultThis clause makes certain changes to those offenders to which Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements 
default(MAPPA) apply. These are the arrangements 
defaultthat criminal justice and social care agencies are obliged to make under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 to co-operate with each other in managing the risks posed by certain sexual, violent and other offenders. The clause is concerned with the duty as it relates to those offenders who receive, or meet the conditions to receive, a disqualification order, which prevents them from working with children. The court’s power to impose disqualification orders was repealed by the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 but t
defaulthe MAPPA arrangements 
defaultcontinue to apply automatically to those who 
defaultreceived them in the past. The G
defaultovernment does not see this as necessary so the clause makes the necessary amendments to ensure that MAPPA arrangements do not apply solely for this reason. Further amendments are made to ensure that this change does not result in a failure to manage serious offenders. MAPPA arrangements are therefore extended to those offences for which a disqualification order could have been imposed which did not previously fall within the duty – parental abduction of a child, trafficking 
default&#xa0;
defaulta
default child for exploitation, and various drugs offences against a child – provided they meet the required level of seriousness set out the Criminal Justice Act 2003.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThis clause does not appear to be contentious as the removal of one means of public protection is largely replaced with another. It is possible that some offenders, particularly those that have committed offences of lesser seriousness that might have met the threshold for disqualification orders but might not do so for MAPPA arrangements, will not be subject to the same level of safeguarding as they were previously. 
defaultT
defaulthe 
defaultJoint 
defaultCommittee 
defaultmight wish to ask the Government the extent 
defaultto which this might be the case.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultI hope these comments are helpful to the Joint Committee.
