[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Thank you for your invitation to send in my views on cycling safety. These are my views. Whether this makes it evidence I don't know.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1. Is Cycling, especially urban cycling safe[bold]Nothing totally safe in the real world. In fact urban cycling is safer on a
[normal] per mile basis than rural cycling. I am told that cycling is about as safe per mile as being a pedestrian; 
[normal]We
[normal] just worry about cycling more. As it puts up your life expectancy it can't be that dangerous. 69 or so pedestrians were killed in London last yea
[normal]r. Has any fuss been made about that? Most of those who call cycling too dangerous seem just to want cyclists off the roads.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]One oft-forgotten issue is that cycling along rural 
[normal]A
[normal] roads is particularly dangerous. Some thought should be given to installing 
[normal]cycle-ways on these whenever building new ones. Here at least there are few pedestrians to clash with.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2[bold] What central and local Government could [bold]do[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.[bold] Whether it would be desirable and feasible to segregate cyclists from other road users, including, for example, by prohibiting HGVs f[bold]rom entering city centres at peak hours[bold]&#xa0;

[normal]A2. A note of concern[bold]Cycling is cheap. And long may it remain so. This means however that the government has little incentive to promote it 
[normal]as it makes little or no money out of it. My concern is that, at the end of the day, the government will be about as keen as to promote cycling as they have been to take effective steps to discourage irresponsible drinking. The amount of tax that goes to t
[normal]he Treasury will probably weigh more heavily with the Government than the nation's health or well-being. This is not a party political matter; the previous government was no better. I am sure that there are a lot of people in government who would be only t
[normal]oo glad if Britain follows the predictions of the "National Transport Model" and the "Cycling Revolution" just never happens.
