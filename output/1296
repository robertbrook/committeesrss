[normal]Great

[normal] in So
[normal]uth Cambridgeshire has only one week
[normal]day bus service to Cambridge and 
[normal]Addenbrooke’s
[normal] hospital (one outward in the morning and 2 inward in the evening). 
[normal] This bus is at the moment subsidised by 
[normal]Cambs
[normal] CC.  This subsidy is soon to be withdrawn.  
[normal]Cambridegeshire
[normal] County Council has as yet not come up with an alternative service to take 6
[normal]th
[normal] formers to their colleges or workers from the village into work or to the Cambridge railway station.
[normal]Because the village is on the cusp of 3 counties (Cambrid
[normal]g
[normal]eshire, Hertfordshire and Essex) 
[normal]t
[normal]here is an early morning bus service under contra
[normal]c
[normal]t to Hert
[normal]ford
[normal]s
[normal]hire
[normal] which goes 
[normal]from Great 
[normal]Chishill
[normal] 
[normal]to Royston 
[normal]railway
[normal] station on school days only.
[normal]Great 
[normal]Chishill
[normal] cannot be left without an adequate public transport service to Cambridge.
