[normal]Failure to secure a prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment for continence problems can have a significant 
[normal]societal
[normal] impact and downstream costs for NHS services
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]An ageing population means more people living with long-term health conditions (LTCs), such as LUTS, will have a significant impact on the demands placed on adult social care and health services
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Care for patients with LUTS takes place across different NHS and social care settings, it is therefore imperative that they are able to access fully integrated services
[normal] 
[normal]throughout the whole patient pathway 
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Despite the existence of clinical guidelines on provision of effective continence services, there is evidence of gaps and variations in the quality of care available to patients across England
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Health and social care quality standards for LUTS and continence 
[normal]will provide useful tools for commissioners and providers when designing and monitoring performance of their local continence services
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]To deliver consistent improvements in continence care, these 
[normal]quality 
[normal]standards 
[normal]must be closely aligned and translated into 
[normal]key levers and mechanisms within the NHS and social care quality improvement framework

[normal]1.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Astellas Pharma Ltd (“Astellas”) 
[normal]welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Health Select Committee’s inquiry into 
[normal]the management of 
[normal]LTCs
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Astellas
[normal] is committed to working in 
[normal]partnership
[normal] with 
[normal]health and social care services in England 
[normal]to 
[normal]deliver 
[normal]high quality
[normal], integrated 
[normal]care
[normal],
[normal] and support the best possible outcomes for patients
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The content of our submission 
[normal]focuses on the experiences and insights from our urology business
[normal] where we have been working 
[normal]with patient, clinical and NHS partners 
[normal]over a number of years 
[normal]to build consensus 
[normal]on the core components of
[normal] high quality care for patients with LUTS including urinary incontinence
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]LUTS cover a diverse range of conditions from the relatively mild to more severe and debilitating and it is estimated that 
[normal]the prevalence of at least some form of LUTS will be a
[normal]lmost two in every three 
[normal]a
[normal]dults
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]These symptoms
[normal] can have a significant impact on quality of life with the potential to negatively affect an individual’s mobility, their sleep, their ability to carry out day-to-day activities as well as their mental wellbeing
[normal],
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is important to know that LUTS are not simply a natural consequence of ageing.
[normal] 
[normal]With high quality advice and support, and early access to the right interventions, most conditions are manageabl
[normal]e
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Unfortunately, m
[normal]any continence problems are left undiagnosed, partly because individuals are often too embarrassed to come forward and seek help
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Failure to secure a prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment for continence problems can 
[normal]lead to poorer outcomes for patients, and escalating care costs through increased morbidity and mortality, for 
[normal]example through the 
[normal]possible 
[normal]heightened 
[normal]risk of falls and fractures amongst older people
[normal], unnecessary cat
[normal]h
[normal]e
[normal]te
[normal]risation and associat
[normal]ed
[normal] urinary tract infections, pressure ulcers linked to poor continence care and acute hospitalisations
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Providing high quality continence care and support is a key test of the capacity of the health and social care system to 
[normal]uphold
[normal] every patients’ right to dignity and respect.
[normal] 
[normal]With an ageing population, the number of people affected across England is set to rise – the need
[normal] to 
[normal]address the current variations 
[normal]in quality of care provision 
[normal]is increasingly pressing.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Care for patients with LUTS takes place across different NHS and social care settings, it is therefore imperative that they are able to access fully integrated services.
[normal] 
[normal]A
[normal] fully integrated continence service should deliver joined-up, patient-centred care throughout the whole the patient pathway across NHS and social care settings.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Practical guidance for commissioners and providers on developing an integrated continence service w
[normal]as
[normal] set out by the Department of Health in 
[normal]Good Practice in Continence Services
[normal] in 2000, and reinforced in the 
[normal]National Service Framework for Older People
[normal], published in 2001.
[normal] 
[normal]However, despite the existence of these resources, evidence from the 
[normal]National Audit of Continence Care 
[normal]published 
[normal]by the Royal College of Physicians 
[normal]during 2010 
[normal]rev
[normal]ealed
[normal] worrying gaps and variations in the standards of care available to patients and a lack of local 
[normal]designated 
[normal]leadership in local services
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The lack of designated local leads responsible for coordinating services 
[normal]coupled with patchy implementation of best practice guidelines 
[normal]has led to the 
[normal]majority of continence services 
[normal]being 
[normal]poorly integrated across acute, medical, surgical, primary, c
[normal]are home and community settings
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Widespread under-
[normal]prioritisation
[normal] 
[normal]has resulted in
[normal] 
[normal]disjointed care, sub-optimal patient outcomes and downstream costs associated with 
[normal]poor
[normal] care
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The NHS reforms provide an opportunity to address these shortcomings and appropriate services are in place to reflect the prevalence of LUTS. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In the new NHS 
[normal]structures
[normal], health and wellbeing boards (HWBs) will have a key role 
[normal]in addressing the fragmented nature of continence services in England.
[normal] 
[normal]Bringing together the experiences and perspectives of 
[normal]representatives 
[normal]from across local authorities, the NHS and patient and public representatives, HWBs are well placed to provide the necessary strategic 
[normal]oversight required to ensure integrated services are designed to reflect the needs of the local health population and scrutinise how effectively 
[normal]these services
[normal] are being delivered.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The recent NHS reforms provide a clear opportunity to address these poor practices and focus on improving outcomes for people affected by LUTS.
[normal] 
[normal]A key part of the new NHS quality improvement framework is the introduction of quality standards, prepared by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which 
[normal]describe markers of high quality care that, when delivered collectively, should improve the effectiveness, safety and experience of care for people with a particular condition.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Astellas welcomes 
[normal]NICE’s 
[normal]plans to develop quality standards for LUTS in men and urinary incontinence in women 
[normal]which will provide a set of concise statements designed to drive quality improvements across a pathway of care.
[normal] 
[normal]These will provide useful tools for commissioners and providers when designing and monitoring performance of their local continence services.
[normal] 
[normal]To succeed, we believe that the final set of statements and supporting metrics should focus on those approaches and interventions that will ultimately make the most difference in terms of patient outcomes, including increased symptom awareness, earlier identification of symptoms and timely access to the best possible quality treatment and supportive care.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As part of its expanded remit, 
[normal]NICE
[normal] now also has
[normal] responsibility for developing 
[normal]guidance and 
[normal]quality standards 
[normal]in
[normal] social care. 
[normal]Encouragingly, 
[normal]NICE is considering
[normal] developing a social care quality standard on promoting continence and preventing and managing incontinence in adults in care homes and the community.
[normal] 
[normal]It is important that any supporting statements and metrics for social care are closely aligned with those included in health quality standards to ensure consistency in the provision of care across both settings.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]To embed high quality care continence care throughout the health and social care system, 
[normal]quality standards 
[normal]for both
[normal] health 
[normal]and social 
[normal]care must be translated into key levers and mechanisms within 
[normal]the NHS Outcomes Framework, NHS Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework and 
[normal]the clinical commissioning group outcome indicator set (CCGOIS). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Astellas supports the Committee’s focus on the capacity of social care services to treat patients with long-term conditions, such as LUTS, in the community.
[normal] 
[normal]The prevalence of LUTS amongst the over 65s is higher than in the general population, and of the 
[normal]thousands of people enter
[normal]ing
[normal] the social care system
[normal] each year
[normal], 
[normal]a large proportion will be experiencing some form of continence problems – faecal and urinary in
[normal]continence 
[normal]has been cited as 
[normal]the second most common reason for 
[normal]people 
[normal]being admitted
[normal] to residential and nursing homes
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There i
[normal]s widespread recognition that an 
[normal]ageing 
[normal]population
[normal] means more people living with long-term health conditions, 
[normal]including
[normal] 
[normal]LUTS
[normal], 
[normal]will have a significant impact on the demands placed on adult social care and health services
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Social care services must work closely with health services 
[normal]to 
[normal]ensure that 
[normal]service
[normal] users receive the treatment and support they need to 
[normal]manage their condition effectively 
[normal]and prevent complications which will result in 
[normal]unplanned 
[normal]hospital admissions.
[normal]

[normal]The Care Quality Commission’s

[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]which 
[normal]looked at how well the health care needs of people living in care homes were met, based on commissioning and provider behaviours
[normal], found worrying gaps in the provision of personalised care, treatment and support 
[normal]for social care
[normal] service users
[normal]:

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A quality standard on ‘p
[normal]romoting continence and managing incontinence
[normal]’
[normal] featured
[normal] within the long-list of social care 
[normal]quality standards
[normal] recently proposed by the Department of Health, to be developed by NICE.
[normal] 
[normal]A 
[normal]social care quality standard on continence problems 
[normal]would support commissioners and providers in assessing how they 
[normal]identif
[normal]y
[normal] and monitor symptoms, 
[normal]how they support patients with continence needs, and deliver appropriate staff training.
[normal] 
[normal]Astellas
[normal] therefore believes that a quality standard on incontinence has the potential to significantly improve the standards of care identified in the Care Quality Commission’s report, and has a key role to play in supporting the delivery 
[normal]of 
[normal]high quality continence care in social care settings.
