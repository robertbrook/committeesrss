[[[Re: Concerning the review of ]]]

[[[The Guardian]]]

[[[ newspaper as part of the inquiry into anti-terrorism]]]I am writing to you on behalf of the international freedom of expression group, ARTICLE 19, and leading civil liberties groups and campaigners in the UK, in relation to the Committee’s review of The Guardian newspaper as a part of the inquiry into anti-terrorism. We are deeply concerned that the Committee’s review of The Guardian could restrict media freedom in the UK, by discouraging future reporting on important matters of public interest. This includes future reporting concerning the sensitive area of national security. We also believe that the Committee’s review of The Guardian raises concerns about the human rights of all individuals to be able to access information about government activities, and to be able to use that information to engage in public debate.We write to you to ask that you consider this

[[[on the free press]]] when dealing with issues related to national security. Frequently, around the world, national security is used to justify arbitrary censorship and to curtail freedom of expression and press freedom. The international community are listening to the vigorous debate currently taking place in the UK that has been sparked by The Guardian. The voice of the Committee will be heard and will have influence beyond UK borders. We, therefore, urge that 

[[[the Committee’s ]]]

[[[The Guardian]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[fully consider]]]

[[[s]]]

[[[ and take]]]

[[[s]]]

[[[ into account international human rights standards, and in particular those that relate to the right to freedom of expression and media freedom]]]. International standards on freedom of expression clearly stipulate that national security arguments must never be used to justify preventing disclosures of illegalities or wrongdoing, no matter how embarrassing such disclosures may be to governments. A summary of the relevant standards is outlined for your consideration in the enclosed Annex (“International freedom of expression standards relating to The Guardian newspaper’s reporting of the Snowden disclosures”).In the present matter, The Guardian published information on large-scale internet and telephone surveillance programmes operated by the US Government with the assistance of the UK security services and a range of private sector internet and telephone companies. The publication of this information has facilitated a much-needed public debate about mass surveillance in a democracy. It also exposed the possible violation of the fundamental human rights of millions of people worldwide. We firmly believe that these matters fall within the public and political field which, according to the UN Human Rights Committee, necessitates special respect and requires the government to provide a particularly pressing justification for restrictions on freedom expression.We observe that the UK government has so far failed to “specify the precise nature of the threat” relating to national security and has relied solely on a general statements referencing the concept of national security. General statements about the threat to national security do not meet established international standards on freedom of expression and media freedom, nor do they present a sufficiently justified pressing social need for such restrictions. The government has also failed to show that that there has been demonstrable harm to national security, and that this harm outweighs the public benefit derived from disclosures about mass surveillance and the potential violation of human rights.We find that The Guardian’s publishing of the Snowden disclosures relates not only to matters of great public importance, but is also directly concerned with reporting the human rights violations entailed in mass surveillance. As such, the most stringent journalistic protection is required.We urge the Committee to uphold international standards on freedom of expression in the present review.

[[[ We respectfully call on you to unequivocally dismiss all allegations that the publishing activities of ]]]

[[[The Guardian]]]

[[[ have breached national security.]]] We strongly believe that any conclusion to the contrary would have a dangerous impact on human rights protection in the UK and would undermine the UK’s international obligations.We are further concerned that the Committee’s review into The Guardian’s activities further adds to an already unduly hostile environment for investigative journalism. We believe that sustained pressure is being applied to The Guardian by politicians and the authorities as a result of their reporting of the Snowden’s revelations. We would like to ask the Committee to be mindful that its approach to questioning The Guardian could bolster politically motivated pressure designed to curtail serious public interest journalism. It is for this reason that we ask you to defend and protect the right to freedom of expression and media freedom in the UK. We would be very happy to further assist you in ensuring that the international standards are protected in the present review. Please do not hesitate to contact us should you need any further information.

[[[The right to freedom of expression under international law]]]&#xa0;The right to freedom of expression is protected under international and European law. Notwithstanding its importance, the right is not absolute and may be restricted in certain limited circumstances. &#xa0;Under Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), restrictions on the right are permitted, inter alia, to ensure the protection of national security or public order (ordre public). However, when a State party imposes restrictions on the exercise of freedom of expression, these restrictions should not jeopardise the right itself.&#xa0;The UN Human Rights Committee has indicated that the relationship between right and restriction, and between the norm and the exception, must not be reversed.&#xa0;Article 19(3) also lays down specific conditions, and it is only subject to these conditions that restrictions may be imposed (the “three part test”):&#xa0;&#xa0;Restrictions must be applied only for those purposes for which they were prescribed and must be directly related to the specific need on which they are predicated.&#xa0;Similar requirements are illustrated and elaborated in the case law of the European Court of Human Rights.&#xa0;Under the above standards the need to protect national security may warrant restriction upon an individual’s freedom of expression, but only if such a limitation is, inter alia, 

[[[“necessary” for a legitimate purpose in the sense that there must be a “pressing social need” for the restriction]]]. &#xa0;The principle of proportionality also has to be respected in the sense that any restriction “must be the 

[[[least intrusive measure to achieve the intended legitimate objective]]] and the 

[[[specific interference in any particular instance must be directly related and proportionate to the need on which they are predicated]]].” All authorities must respect the principle of proportionality when applying the restrictions.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Limiting the right to freedom of expression on the grounds of national security]]]&#xa0;While there is a no universal definition of national security, there has been extensive development on the scope and boundaries of the concept by UN bodies and experts in the past two decades. &#xa0;We note that these elaborations have taken a narrow view of the scope of the concept of “national security.” As a preliminary matter, the UN Human Rights Committee has found that states must 

[[[“specify the precise nature of the threat”]]] relating to national security 

[[[rather than relying on a general statement of the concept]]].&#xa0;In General Comment No. 34, the Human Rights Committee explicitly stated that: &#xa0;Extreme care must be taken by State parties to ensure that treason laws and similar provisions relating to national security, whether described as official secrets or sedition laws or otherwise, are crafted and applied in a manner that conforms to the strict requirements of paragraph 3. It is not compatible with paragraph 3, for instance, to invoke such laws to 

[[[suppress or withhold from the public information of legitimate public interest that does not harm national security or to prosecute journalists]]], researchers, environmental activists, human rights defenders, or others, for having disseminated such information.  [emphasis added]&#xa0;The Siracusa Principles on the Limitation and Derogation of Provisions in the ICCPR further sets out circumstances in which national security can legitimately apply: &#xa0;29. National security may be invoked to justify measures limiting certain rights only when they are taken to protect the existence of the nation or its territorial integrity or political independence against force or threat of force.&#xa0;30. National security cannot be invoked as a reason for imposing limitations to prevent merely local or relatively isolated threats to law and order.&#xa0;31. National security cannot be used as a pretext for imposing vague or arbitrary limitations and may only be invoked when there exists adequate safeguards and effective remedies against abuse.&#xa0;32. The 

[[[systematic violation of human rights undermines true national security and may jeopardize international peace and security. A state responsible for such violation shall not invoke national security as a justification for measures aimed at suppressing opposition to such violation or at perpetrating repressive practices against its population]]]. [emphasis added]&#xa0;The UN Special Rapporteur on Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression also set out his expert view on limitation in his report to the Commission on Human Rights in 1994:&#xa0;For the purpose of protecting national security, the right to freedom of expression and information can be restricted only in the most serious cases of a direct political or military threat to the entire nation.&#xa0;The Special Rapporteur, in cooperation with the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media and the OAS Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression, issued a special declaration on freedom of information in 2004, stating:&#xa0;Certain information may legitimately be secret on grounds of national security or protection of other overriding interests. However, secrecy laws should define national security precisely and indicate clearly the criteria which should be used in determining whether or not information can be declared.&#xa0;The definition of national security has also been further developed by the Johannesburg Principles on National Security, Freedom of Expression and Access to Information:&#xa0;(a) A restriction sought to be justified on the ground of national security is not legitimate unless its genuine purpose and demonstrable effect is to protect a country's existence or its territorial integrity against the use or threat of force, or its capacity to respond to the use or threat of force, whether from an external source, such as a military threat, or an internal source, such as incitement to violent overthrow of the government.(b) In particular, a restriction sought to be justified on the ground of national security is not legitimate if its genuine purpose or demonstrable effect is to protect interests unrelated to national security, including, for example, to protect a government from embarrassment or exposure of wrongdoing, or to conceal information about the functioning of its public institutions, or to entrench a particular ideology, or to suppress industrial unrest.&#xa0;As described above, states must show that a restriction on freedom of expression on national security grounds is necessary. Principle 15(1) of the Johannesburg Principles elaborates on this requirement by stating that 

[[[“no person may be punished on national security grounds for disclosure of information if (1) the disclosure does not actually harm and is not likely to harm a legitimate national security interest.”]]]&#xa0;Additionally, the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression, in his 2012 report reiterated that &#xa0;Journalists should not be held accountable for receiving, storing and disseminating classified data which they have obtained in a way that is not illegal, including leaks and information received from unidentified sources.&#xa0;Further, the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media and the OAS Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression, in the declaration on freedom of information explicitly stated that:&#xa0;Public authorities and their staff bear sole responsibility for protecting the confidentiality of legitimately secret information under their control. Other individuals, including 

[[[journalists and civil society representatives, should never be subject to liability for publishing or further disseminating this information, regardless of whether or not it has been leaked to them, unless they committed fraud or another crime to obtain the information]]]. Criminal law provisions that don’t restrict liability for the dissemination of State secrets to those who are officially entitled to handle those secrets should be repealed or amended.[emphasis added]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; See Human Rights Committee, General Comment No 27, Freedom of Movement (Article 12), CCPR/C/GC/21/Rev.1/Add.1, 2 November 1999, para 13.
