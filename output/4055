[normal]Submission from Roy Bailey[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]I am an electrician with 30 years experience having City and Guilds / electrical engineering certificates and now unregistered subcontractor since building control has put part P in. When I saw the video my thoughts were clear, why we have so many complicated schemes. There must be another way for the public as in my eyes if a scheme is simple/easy then there would be more compliance.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Building Control only needs to go a bit further, to directly check the competency of each electrician (insurance ,qualifications etc ) that need /want to comply with part P. Then you wouldn’t need lots or indeed any of the current private company schemes for part P.  Building Control would take over part P compliance, to public domestic electrical work .It would give a fairer playing ground for big and small contractors with respect to costs.

[normal]I also think electrical certificates, even standardised ones, as the Institution of Engineering and Technology 
[normal]forms,.would
[normal] be recognised better by the public if issued via Building Control but still submitted from the electrician.   Then the Public are more likely to get the correct one! I know of a contractor who didn’t issue a electrical certificate because of the current Building Control notification, the client only got a BC one.  There only needs one certificate the correct one.
