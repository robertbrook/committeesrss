[normal]Written evidence from Christopher Gill[bold]WHO  CARES  ?[bold]So,
[normal] what are the principles upon which 
[normal]traditional English common law i
[normal]s founded ?
[normal] 
[normal]Firstly, that until proven otherwise,
[normal] every person is presumed
[normal] innocent. 
[normal]The 
[normal]presumption of[bold]  
[normal]innocence[bold] [bold]i
[normal]s the 
[normal]very keystone of the British criminal justice system.
[normal]S
[normal]econdly, except under the circumstances prescribed
[normal] in the latter day Prevention of Terrorism Act, nobody may have their liberty infringed
[normal] without being charged in open court within 24 
[normal]hours of arrest. Crucially the ‘charge’ has to be backed by 
[normal]prima facie
[normal] evidence.
[normal] Even when the suspect is thought to have committed murder
[normal],
[normal] detention without charge may 
[normal]only be extended, with the permission of magistrates, to a maximum of 96 hours
[normal]. This fundamental principle is enshrined in the law of 
[normal]Habeas Corpus[bold] 
[normal]which Archbishop Desmond Tutu once described as being
[normal] 
[normal]”such an incredible part of freedom”.
[normal]Thirdly,
[normal] the right to
[normal] 
[normal]trial by jury[bold],[bold] 
[normal]originating
[normal] 
[normal]in 
[normal]M
[normal]agna Carta
[normal],
[normal] forms part of the very bedrock of the British criminal justice system. It
[normal]s significance
[normal] is that it ensures that the defendant can insist that he 
[normal]or she 
[normal]is effectively ‘tried’ by his 
[normal]or her 
[normal]peers -
[normal] 
[normal]‘
[normal]12 good men and true
[normal]’
[normal] -
[normal] 
[normal]drawn at random from amongst the general public
[normal] and demonstrably 
[normal]i
[normal]ndependent of 
[normal]‘the powers that be’
[normal] who
[normal] might otherwise act in an authoritarian and arbitrary fashion.
[normal]Fourthly, until recently that is, it was always held that once a defendant had been acqu
[normal]itted it was unlawful to charge
[normal] 
[normal]that person 
[normal]again 
[normal]with the same offence. 
[normal]Double j[bold]eopardy[bold] was something that British subjects have heretofore never had to worry about. The view was taken that it was totally unacceptable that a potentially innocent person should forever live under the threat of being dragged through the courts 
[normal]again and again in the circumstances in which the prosecution had failed to establish guilt in the first case
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]An unwritten principle of 
[normal]the 
[normal]British 
[normal]criminal justice system was that it was better that 10 guilty men went free than that one innocent person be hanged
[normal].
[normal]Fifthly, in order t
[normal]o avoid the possibility of
[normal] 
[normal]defendant
[normal]s
[normal] being condemned on the strength of thei
[normal]r own testimony the law embraces
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] right to silence[bold].
[normal]Sixthly
[normal], the 
[normal]inadmissibility of hearsay[bold] [bold]avoids the pos
[normal]sibility of
[normal] defendant
[normal]s
[normal] being found guilty on the basis of say-so evidence from absent ‘witnesses’.
[normal]Seventhly, the 
[normal]withholding of previous convictions[bold] [bold]ensures that the hearing of cases brought to court are not prejudiced by the defendant’s previous record
[normal].
[normal]Eighthly, trials 
[normal]in absentia[bold],[bold] 
[normal]in
[normal] other words trials in the absence of the defendant
[normal],
[normal] have no place in the British criminal justice system
[normal].
[normal]Finally, we have
[normal] 
[normal]reporting restrictions[bold] so that whilst matters are 
[normal]sub judice
[normal] 
[normal]Press reporting is limited so as not to prejudice a fair trial.
[normal]As can be seen from the foregoing
[normal],
[normal] the British system of criminal justice has bent over backwards to 
[normal]protect and defend the individual from State inspired coercion. It has been the individual’s sure protection against false accusation, arbitrary arrest and wrongful imprisonment.
[normal]As we face a future i
[normal]n which the harmonisation of
[normal] criminal justice systems within the European Union looms ever closer it is instructive to note that there is no equivalent of the law of 
[normal]Habeas Corpus
[normal] 
[normal]in continental Europe, trial by jury is a little known concept and they most certainly don’t start from a position of presumed innocence !
[normal]As for all the other defences against State coercion that we British enjoy
[normal],
[normal] in the event of an acquittal, 
[normal]the continental systems 
[normal]allow the prosecution to appeal for the defendant to be tried again; a defendant
[normal]’
[normal]s refusal to answer questions is regarded as an admission of guilt; reported or ‘hearsay’ evidence is frequently used to obtain convictions; a defendant’s record, including prosecutions pending, may be read out at the hearing
[normal]; the defendant may be tried without being present in court or, as recently confirmed, without the defendant even being aware of the hearing and, 
[normal]not l
[normal]east, the Press are free to nam
[normal]e names and express opinions both before a
[normal]nd during the course of 
[normal]a trial.
[normal]At a time when we stand in extreme
[normal] danger of having the European Court of J
[normal]ustice made superior to our own national institutions
[normal] t
[normal]hose of us who were born free, for that is the very nature of our British inheritance, would do well to contemplate the 
[normal]commendable 
[normal]words of Admiral Blake, the chief founder of England’s naval supremacy in the 17
[normal]th
[normal] century
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]that “I will have the whole world know that none but an Englishman shall chastise an Englishman”
[normal].
[normal]The English common law is what has made us a free people and has kept us a free people – the prospect of surrendering it in favour of criminal justice systems whose 
[normal]raison d’etre
[normal] 
[normal]is to ensure the supremacy of the State rather than the freedom of the individual is really too awful to contemplate but, be warned and be 
[normal]very 
[normal]afraid, that
[normal] is the direction in which your Government is currently taking you.
