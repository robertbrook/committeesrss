"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Citizens Advice&#xa0;\n1. I\nntroduction\n&#xa0;\n1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCitizens Advice welcomes the \nopportunity to submit evidence to the Co\nmmittee’s inqui\nry into this important subject.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe Citizens Advice service provides free, independent, confidential and impartial \nadvice\n to everyone on their rights and responsibilities. It values diversity, promote\ns equality and challenges discrimination.\n \nThe service aims:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the year to April 2013\n, Citizens Advice Bureaux in \nEngland\n and \nW\nales\n dealt with\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe housing costs component of Universal Credit (UC) will not constitute a “clean sheet\n”. The essential structure of HB (and support for mortgage interest) will carry through into UC\n, along with a \nnumber of associated problems\n, which we explore below\n.\n&#xa0;\n2. The main\n issues\n&#xa0;\nAffordable housing and shortfalls in housing-related benefits&#xa0;\n2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCitizens Advice endorses\n the definition of “affordable housing” adopted by Lord Whitty’s independent inquiry into affordable homes\n:\n “comfortable, secure homes in sound condition that are available to rent or buy without leaving households unable to afford their other basic needs\n (eg food, clothing, heating, transport and social life)”. \n&#xa0;\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs regards rents eligible for HB - and in due course the rental element of UC - we fully accept that HB/ UC cannot be expected to meet any rent, however high. But limits must take account of the \nconse\nquences for poverty and social exclusion\n and our bureaux are picking up growing numbers of cases where HB cuts are causing hardship \nand debt\n.\n \nThe role of such limits in leaving claimants with inadequate disposable incomes after paying the rent is ther\nefore part of a wider problem – pointing to the need to develop a strategy for genuinely affordable housing in all sectors.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDisc\nretionary Housing Payments (\nDHPs\n) have featured prominently in the current debate as a possible solution to HB cuts in individu\nal cases\n and CAB advice on DHPs has almost trebled in the first quarter of 2013-14 compared with the same quarter the previous year\n.\n However, their \npotential \nrole is exaggerated\n, given the scale of the problem\n. A perspective can be gained from the fact tha\nt in the current year (2013-14) the overall DHP b\nudget is equivalent to about seven\n per cent of the HB cuts total\n. The consequent tight\n rationing means that payments, even when made, are frequently temporary\n, with no guaran\ntee that the claimant will be\n able to find \nsomewhere affordable \nby the time the DHP expires.\n&#xa0;\nShared accommodation rate (SAR)&#xa0;\n2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA specific example of problematic HB\n/ UC restriction\n is the SAR, a lower level of eligib\nle rent\n based on the assumption that the claimant occupies shared acco\nm\nmodation,\n whether they do or not. Previously, it applied to single childless under-25s, but from January 2012 was extended to single childless under-35s. (It also applies to older people who actually do live in shared accommodation).\n \nThe SAR causes major \nproblems of affordability of adequate accommodation.\n Sharing is often not appropriate (see case illustration below) or accommodation within the SAR\n is simply unavailable.\n&#xa0;\nA CAB in the South West advised a 31-year-old man with mental health difficulties wh\no\n was\n under the care of an NHS psychiatrist. Due to his mental health problem\ns, it was\n not feasible for him to share\n accommodation\n. H\ne wa\ns, therefore, the sole occupant of\n a one-\nbedroom apartment, the rent for which was substantially higher than the SAR\n.\n A\n DHP\n was\n temporarily helping with the shortfall of £70 per month\n, but he could not\n meet the rent in the long term.\n&#xa0;\nBenefit cap&#xa0;2.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn our view, \nensuring that work pays should be a matter of bolstering in-work incomes, not cutting out-of-work benefits.\n&#xa0;\n2.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn any case, \nit is \nhard to understand the case for including \nbenefits that are available on similar terms both in and out of work – notably HB/ the rental component of UC; Child Tax Credits/ the children’s elements of UC; and Child Benefit.\n&#xa0;\n2.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nClaimants advised by our bureaux illustrate the challenges faced by people affected by \nthe benefit cap. For many\n, solutions are very limited - in part because work is often not an option. The Government’s own impact assessment shows that only just over a t\nhird of households affected receive Jobseeker’s Allowance – the others being carers, parents of young children or receiving Employment and Support Allowance (ESA).\n&#xa0;\nA CAB in the South East advised a single mother with three children (the \nyoungest aged thre\ne) receiving Income S\nupport. Her house was\n the appropriate size for HB purposes, but the benefit cap will leave her a shortfall in rent of £38.23 per week\n. She\n worked full time through the childhood of her older two children but now stays \nat home to look a\nfter \nthe three-year-\nold. \nShe had\n applied for a \nDHP\n but \nreceived a prelim\ninary indication that she was\n unlikely to be successful. \nShe is no\nw facing the prospect of trying to find\n the shortfall in\n rent out of her I\nncome\n S\nupport. This is causing her a\ncute anx\niety.\n&#xa0;\nExtension of HB size restrictions to the social rented sector&#xa0;\n2.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRestriction of HB eligible rent \nfor accommodation of various sizes has been a feature of the scheme in the private rented sector for many years. From April 2013, \nHB \nsize restrictions have been extended to social housing. \nAlthough promoted as a means of addressing under-occupation, the shortage\n of opportunities\n&#xa0;\nfor affected claimants to move means that\n&#xa0;\nthe measure is widely perceived as a levy on b\nenefits rather than a\n means of\n \nmaking\n better use of the housing st\no\nck\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCAB \nevidence shows a very high demand f\nor advice on this change, \nacross \nEngland\n and \nWales\n. For many\n,\n there are no solutions. In some cases, tenants need the room - for example, for their child to visit\n, \nor because a disability makes it impractical for couples to share\n; others are prevented from moving because of the unavailability of appropriate stock; or are excluded from exchange or transfer s\nchemes due to rent arrears. Regarding\n this last problem, the \nNational Housing Federation has suggested to its members th\nat flexibility might be appropriate\n where arrears have arisen in consequence of the HB size restrictions. We support that approach.\n&#xa0;\n2.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEvidence shows that claimants affected by the HB size restrictio\nns are also likely to be caught by other benefit changes that together leave people facing considerable hardship and rent arrears\n.\n&#xa0;\nA CAB on the \nSouth\n \nCo\nast\n adv\nised a client in her 50s who had\n been living on her own in a 3-bedroom council house since her c\nhildren left home. She has long-\nterm health problems related to a genetic blood disorder. She\n had\n recently lost her \nESA\n \nafter being found fit for work\n and had appealed\n against the decision. The size restrictions\n had\n reduced her HB by £100 per month and she\n \nwas receiving\n a\n DHP\n that was\n due to end\n shortly. Alth\nough she had\n agreed to move to a smaller property,\n she had\n been\n told that she could spend\n up to three\n years on\n the waiting lis\nt. She was worried how she would\n manage to \npay the rent until she could move\n and was\n distressed and concerned about what\n might happen when her DHP stopped\n.\n&#xa0;\nHelp with mortgage costs&#xa0;2.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA very limited \nSupport for Mortgage Interest \n(SMI) \nscheme helps with mortgage interest for people receiving out-of-work \nmeans-tested \nbenefits. It is \nrestricted by waiting periods, time limits for certain groups and \na standard assumed interest rate (recently reduced\n from 6.08 to 3.63 per cent\n). The \nintroduction of UC\n will further restrict help with mortgage interest, as any earnings will disqualify the \nclaimant from support (at present, limited part-time earnings are permitted).\n&#xa0;\nA CAB in the \nNorth West\n advised a client in her 40s who suffers from depression and anxiety. She\n had\n sustained a double benefit cut as a result of \nbeing found fit for work and \nof \nthe\n reduction\n \nin the standard rate of interest used to calculate\n SMI\n.\n \nShe was\n now unable \nto meet the shortfall in her mortgage payments. \nThese growing financial pressures \nwere \nthreaten\ning\n \nto worsen\n her mental health problems\n and she faced\n the possibilit\ny of losing her home.\n&#xa0;\nNon-dependant deductions&#xa0;2.12\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nN\non-dependant deductions (N\nD\nDs) are reductions in housing costs eligible for HB and SMI,\n based on assumed \n(not actual) \ncontributions from “non-dependants” such as grown-up children and elderly relatives. \nThe\n non-dependant is under no obligation to make these payments or to disclose their own financial details. Logically, one would expect non-dependants themselves to be able to claim HB to help them pay the assumed contribution, but in fact they cannot.\n&#xa0;\n2.13\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNDDs\n \ncause various problems (of hardship, complexity, reduced housing options and work disincentives)\n. \nT\nhe pre\nvious Government had frozen them\n for some years, with a view to phasing them out. The current Government has returned to a policy of increasing them, w\nell above the rate of inflation.\n&#xa0;\n2.14\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNDDs are to be restructured (and re-named “housing cost c\nontributions”) under\n UC, with an emphasis on reducing work disincentives for the non-dependant, but at the cost of extending their impact elsewhere, notably to many \nyoung unemployed people and their parents.\n&#xa0;\nA CAB in the East of England advised an unemployed couple with three dependent children and a 20-year-old daughter earning £210 per week gross. \nT\nhe daughter was not meeting the NDD. A suspended possession order \nwas eventually made, the arrears partly resulting from the NDD. The daughter has since taken out a loan to make back payments. The total weekly rent is £90 and it seems unreasonable that over 40 per cent of this should be payable by the daughter (who share\ns a bedroom with a younger sister).\n&#xa0;\nLocalised Council Tax Support&#xa0;2.15\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe abolition of Council Tax Benefit and its replacement with cash-limited localised relief is expected to create a scenario\n in England\n in which people on very low incomes will be required\n to pay small amounts of council tax that they cannot afford, creating major problems of collection, enforcement and debt\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.16\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLocal tapers (withdrawal rates) will also potentially overlap with the UC taper, causing high marginal deduction rates across the a\nffected part of the income scale\n, \na problem which UC was supposed to solve.\n The original intention was that CTB would become part of UC – a coherence that has now been lost.\n&#xa0;\nA CAB in \nLondon\n advised a single, disabled man with a\nn artificial leg. He lived\n i\nn 2-bedroom council accommodation\n, receiving\n Income Support and Disability Living Allowance\n (DLA)\n. His HB ha\nd\n been reduced by 14 per cent under\n the size restrictions and he was\n now li\nable to pay 15 per cent of his council t\nax.\n This meant he now had\n to find\n £60 per month towards h\nis rent and £10.60 towards his council t\nax. \n&#xa0;\nCumulative impacts&#xa0;\n2.17\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCuts to a range of benefits will oft\nen affect\n the same individuals and families, having a multiple impact and causing considerable hardship. This is a neglected issue and is not adequately monitored. HB rides on top of other benefits and is received by the full range of claimant groups, so will featu\nre strongly in multiple impacts – as will the rental element of UC. \nThe case examples at paragraphs 2.10, 2.11 and 2.16 illustrate this.\n&#xa0;\n2.18\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProposals for \nbenefit legislation should therefore be accompanied by a poverty impact assessment sufficiently sophisti\ncated to provide estimates of multiple impacts.\n&#xa0;\nPayment of HB/ UC to tenants rather than direct to landlords&#xa0;\n2.19\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlready the default position for HB in the private rented sector, it is intended that this will\n be the case in all sectors as\n UC is introduced. \n&#xa0;\n2.20\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA number of “demonstration projects” are under way to test this approach. There will be exceptions, relating to vulnerability and/ or rent arrears. It is expected that arrears will be a significant problem. \n&#xa0;\n2.21\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIndeed, the demonstration projects have alr\nead\ny shown this to be the\n case: the most recent report monitoring\n the six project areas \ncommented that: \n“\ncollection rates are lower in all project areas than before the (demonstration projects) went live. And more of the rent that is paid arrives in instalmen\nts through the month (i.e. late) rather than on time in one sum as it did when Housing Benefit was paid by the local authority direct to the landlord. Landlord income and cash flow has, therefore, reduced. A small percentage rise in arrears represents sign\nificant funds for landlords”\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.22\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhen direct payments\n to tenants\n were introduced \nas the norm in the private rented s\nector\n, phased \nbet\nween 2007-\n2011, Citizens Advice saw a significant \nrise\n in the number of \nprivate tenants seeking help with problems concerni\nng arrears – a 64 per cent increase \nover the three years\n. W\ne \nbelieve that the payment change\n was a sign\nificant contributor to this\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.23\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe DWP research\n report\n on the demonstration projects also\n concluded that supporting tenants to \nminimis\ne such consequences \nare “frequently linked to resource-intensive interventions”\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.24\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is important to note also that a policy of normally \nmandatory direct payment to tenants\n \nmilitates against principles of choice.\n&#xa0;\n2.25\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUnless there is a reason for mandatory direct payment to the \nlandlord (rent arrears above a specified level or vulnerability issues such as drug or alcohol abuse) the choice, in our view, should lie with the claimant as to who – claimant or landlord – should receive benefit payments for rent. This could be on an “op\nt in” basis (analogous to setting up a direct debit) to satisfy the Government’s concern with active claimant engagement. \n&#xa0;\n2.26\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAt the very least, this option should be available for a transitional period of no less than a year, to enable any necessary money a\ndvice and financial capability support to be put in place.\n&#xa0;\nA CAB in \nWales\n advised a 50-year-old single woman living in a housing association property. She rec\neived\n ESA\n,\n had fibromyalgia and was\n also ver\ny forgetful. Her HB was originally\n paid to her landlord but was changed to direct payment to her. Since then she\n had\n fallen into arrears \nand was\n now being taken to court for possession. The \ndirect payment decision had\n been rescinded, but she\n was\n still being taken to court.\n&#xa0;\n2.27\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis issue reflects a wider problem. \nAlthough people on low incomes often – of necessity – have excellent financial survival skills, claimants face new challenges relating to benefit cuts and payment changes.\n \nAs part of our Managing Migration project, w\ne r\necently surveyed\n over 1,700\n of our\n clients who will start to receive \nUC\n from October\n and explored\n whether they felt they \nwould be able to cope with five possible problem areas\n – budgeting, monthly payments, banking, stayin\ng informed and internet access.\n&#xa0;\n9\n2 per cent\n said they felt unprepared for the ne\nw system in at least one area, while 38 per cent\n will need support with all\n of the possible problem areas.\n&#xa0;\nThis is \nthe first stage of a pilot we a\nre carrying out in three locations\n – \nBir\nmingham\n, Ynys Mon and \nN\north Dorset\n – to\n test out how we can support people with these changes.\n&#xa0;\n2.28\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn our view, both central and local government should therefore have in place an adequate \nsupport strategy for claimants in need of money advice (including benefits, debt and financia\nl capability). This should include input from\n our\n bureaux, with appropriate funding.\n For our part, as well as providing support to individuals, we will be able to share our findings from our Managing Migration project to help develop innovative approaches \nto helping claimants with the transition to the new system.\n&#xa0;\n3. Conclusions\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe impact of these changes are being felt by our clients across every area of \nEngland\n and \nWales\n. Over time, given the range of benefit changes and against the backdrop of higher \ncosts of living in general, many people both in and out of work will face increasing challenges to pay their rent or mortgage.\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhile the drive to reduce rising housing costs within benefit spending totals is understandable, this will not be effectively ac\nhieved by simply cutting benefits. It’s now vital that we see the development of policies aimed at driving down housing costs themselves. Without this more strategic approach, blunt policies to cut entitlement will have a serious impact on family finances \nin the short and the longer term, with all the attendant consequences for poverty, social inclusion, health and wellbeing.\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs regards the roll-out of UC, we have noted in the previous section\n that our research suggests a substantial need\n for support among\n people who would otherwise struggle with the new payment systems. \nIt is also \ncrucial to remember the additional challenges for budgeting that people will face, not just as a result of the changes to how support is paid, but because of the greater risks of\n income shortfalls, sudden or otherwise. It is one thing to adjust to a monthly budget, but when managing a rent shortfall over a long period or a sudden income cut due to, say, the loss of \nESA\n and/ o\nr of DLA\n, or perhaps incurring a benefit sanction, \nsevere debt may suddenly no longer be avoidable.\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe are therefore \ncalling on the Government to:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n3.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Department for Communities and Local Government should \nencourage social landlords to facilitate transfers which would otherwise not take place because of rent arrears, if those arrears have arisen subsequent to the application of the HB/ UC size restri\nctions.\n&#xa0;\n3.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProposals for benefit legislation should be accompanied by \na poverty impact assessment sufficiently sophisticated to provide estimates of multiple impacts.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n30 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nTo have or have not? – taking responsibility for tomorrow’s affordable homes today, \nLord Whitty \n[Chair], report of the Independent Inquiry into the Affordable Homes Crisis, Housing Voice, September 2012, p.6.\n Published DWP DHP figures combined with HB cuts estimate from Chartered Institute of Housing (correspondence, July 2013).\n Hence\n the informal but widespread term, “bedroom tax”. Ministers have countered with the phrase ”removal of the spare room subsidy”. As this is not strictly a tax, while the term “subsidy” could be used to describe any benefit for anything, we have used the mor\ne straightforward expression, “HB/ UC size restrictions”.\n In \nScotland\n and \nWales\n, the position is different in that the governments there are making up the central funding shortfall from their own resources. Some English councils have done likewise – at l\neast for the current year.\n \nDirect payments demonstration projects: learning the lessons, six months in\n, P. Hickman &amp; K.
