[[[About the RFU]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;

[[[Introduction]]]Women’s rugby in England has seen a steady increase in participation and interest in recent years from a very low base a decade ago.  Prior to 2011 the Rugby Football Union for Women was a separate entity to the RFU.  Following integration the RFU’s full resources have been put behind developing women’s rugby at all levels of the Game.  &#xa0;With the platform of the Women’s Rugby World Cup in 2014, a home Rugby World Cup in 2015 and rugby sevens entering the Olympics in 2016 for both men and women, there is a huge opportunity for the RFU to broaden the appeal of the Game amongst women.  The RFU is also working to widen access to women working and volunteering in rugby at all the levels of the Game, as we recognise that a balanced workforce will strengthen the Game.  As this submission will show, English rugby has developed from a heavily male dominated sport to a more balanced one in just a few years, and this progress will continue.  &#xa0;Female engagement in rugby union in England is far higher than participation, suggesting that there are significant perception or practical barriers to women playing rugby.  This submission considers these barriers and makes some recommendations to the Committee on how public policy might help women and girl’s rugby to flourish further.&#xa0;The RFU’s submission is divided into core areas of activity – performance, media, commercial, fan engagement, leadership, facilities and rugby in schools.  The RFU has also made some recommendations to the Committee.

[[[Performance rugby]]]1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; England women’s teams are world beaters.  The Senior 15-a-side team has enjoyed a sustained period of success coming 2nd place in the last three successive World Cups 2002, 2006 and 2010 in England.  They have won seven RBS 6 Nations titles since 2003, and six Grand Slams in the last decade.  The Senior 7 a-side team are also very successful, and came runners up in the 2013 7s World Series.1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The RFU supports three women’s elite teams – Senior 15–a-side, Senior 7-a-side, and Under 20s 15-a-side.  Previously more teams have been supported but a decision was made to consolidate the offering to ensure quality was higher and support better for those top teams.&#xa0; 1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There are approximately 1,000 women playing rugby to a very high level within the talent pathway. The talent pathway focuses on talented players from U15 to senior level.  The markers used to assess the health of the game have been agreed with Sport England.

[[[Sarah Hunter]]] England XIs Captain&#xa0;Sarah began playing rugby league aged nine at primary school and started in union five years later. Born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Sarah attended Goathland Primary and Longbenton Community College in North Tyneside before gaining a BSc in Sport Science and Mathematics at Loughborough University. She is now a RFU University Rugby Development Officer for the South West.&#xa0;Her achievements feature winning the British Universities Championship with Loughborough, captaining Lichfield from 2005-09, the North East U18 and Northumberland U16 sides. Her international triumphs span the Six Nations five times, together with the European Championship, Nations Cup and European Trophy twice each. Personal accolades are players’ player awards at Novocastrians, Lichfield, Loughborough University and the England Academy.&#xa0;1.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The RFU invested approximately £2.5m on women’s elite rugby last year, which includes talent identification and development.&#xa0; This is lower than the investment in the men’s elite programme, due to a number of factors including that the RFU has to pay release fees from Premiership clubs for the men.  The RFU has been relatively well placed internationally in investment in the women’s 7s programme.  The England 15s programme is one of the best resourced in the world which allows England to compete at the top level.&#xa0; 1.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Though the sponsorship value of the women’s Game is significantly lower than the men’s at present, which is why we offer sponsors rights to both (see 3.1), the RFU is committed to investing in women’s rugby over and above the income it currently generates.  The RFU does not receive any public funding from UK Sport to support the elite women’s programme but does from Sport England through to 2014.  Public investment in women’s rugby is vital, and we urge the Government to continue to invest in women’s rugby. 1.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In 2010 England hosted the fifth Women’s Rugby World Cup.  This marked a significant shift in interest in elite women’s rugby.

[[[Major event, ]]]

[[[Women’s Rugby World Cup]]]&#xa0;In 2010 England hosted the Women’s Rugby World Cup.&#xa0;  The competition was contested over 16 days with 30 matches between 12 nations. &#xa0;Interest in the tournament was far higher than in the previous five WRWCs.  Thirteen matches were broadcast live by Sky Sports to 127 countries and all pool games were sold out with a total attendance of 30,000 over the tournament.&#xa0;The final was held at the Twickenham Stoop with England finishing as runner up.  It was attended by a world record crowd for the women’s 15s game of around 13,500, and saw a TV audience of half a million.&#xa0;

[[[Media]]]

[[[ ]]]2.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The media can play a crucial role in challenging misperceptions of rugby as a sport exclusively for men.  The RFU seeks to get the England women extensive coverage in print, broadcast and social media.  The RFU employs a full time Communications Manager to work on promoting women’s elite rugby. Promoting grassroots women’s and girls’ rugby is part of the RFU’s Regional Communications team’s remit and we have introduced targets to try and increase local coverage.2.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Rapid improvements in the coverage of elite women’s rugby have been made in the last decade.  Prior to 2009 there was little national coverage of women’s rugby.  England hosting the 2010 Women’s Rugby World Cup prompted a significant shift and the media became much more engaged.2.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The WRWC saw record media coverage and attendances (noted above in Case Study 2).  Sky Sports televised 13 games live in total, and the commercial value of the ‘known’ media coverage (excluding TV and radio) equated to more than £1.1 million.  The total ‘known’ media circulation figure saw our reach as exposing 77 million people to England Women’s rugby.2.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Since 2010, interest in England Women’s rugby has continued to increase with consistent national media coverage.  All the England women home games were accessible to watch or listen live on Sky Sports, BBC, radio 5 live or RFU.com in the 2012/13 season.2.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The RFU media team feel that despite not being part of the 2012 Olympic Games, the focus on women’s sport has boosted women’s rugby also.  The RFU has seen a shift in the media being more proactive in promoting women’s rugby.  The RFU believes that there has been a significant change in the mind-set of the media following 2012, and urges the Committee to encourage the media to push themselves even further.2.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The RFU media team use the profile of the men’s squad and management team to drive coverage of the women’s team and their achievements.  The RFU has found that joint press conferences are successful in raising awareness of the women’s Game, and result in more press coverage than a standalone women’s team press conference.  Joint press conferences will be held for the forthcoming QBE Internationals and RBS 6 Nations.&#xa0;

[[[Commercial ]]]

[[[investment]]]3.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Since the Rugby Football Union for Women was integrated with the RFU, the RFU does not separate its sponsorship of women’s and men’s programmes.    The RFU has a strong commercial programme, and works with partners to ensure that they have a far-reaching and embedded place within England rugby.  This ensures the maximum commercial investment into all aspects of the Game, including women’s rugby.3.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Many of the RFU’s sponsorship agreement contain rights related to both the men’s and women’s programmes.  Among our commercial agreements, O2 sponsors both the men’s and women’s senior 15s, and Canterbury provides the match, training and leisure kit for both the men’s and women’s programmes.&#xa0; The RFU’s sponsorship agreement with Canterbury contains a specific minimum allocation of kit for the women’s programme.&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Case Study 3]]]

[[[: Heathrow Express]]]Today (19th October 2013) the RFU has announced that Heathrow Express is the new Official Principal Partner of England Sevens.  The premium air-rail link will feature on the front of the playing shirt for both the England men and women Sevens teams, and will be the Official Transport Provider for them.  The partnership also grants the right to imagery of, and appearances by, both the men’s and women’s squads.&#xa0;3.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Gender-based tournament prize money is not relevant within the RFU.&#xa0; Success in international tournaments results in payments to the Union concerned rather than payment to individual participants.  While neither the men’s nor the women’s senior 15-a-side players are employed by the RFU to play for England, the RFU has recently instituted an Elite Player agreement for the women’s players which, like that for the men’s, sets out the support from the Union in areas such as training and medical cover.&#xa0;

[[[4)]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Fan engagement]]]4.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The RFU has recently undertaken research on fans so we can better understand our customers with a view to making their experience better, and to widen access to rugby to attract those who don’t currently come to Twickenham.  Matches at Twickenham attract a surprisingly high proportion of women compared to similar sports with approximately 35% attendees at rugby matches at Twickenham being female.  For the Marriott London Sevens weekend the attendees are equally split between male and female, due to the younger profile of the audience and the relaxed atmosphere of this particular event.  The RFU will be analysing these results and working with focus groups to find out why there is such a gulf between the number of women who claim to be “passionate about rugby”, and the numbers that are motivated to participate in the Game.4.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; England Connected is the RFU’s campaign to ensure everyone feels part of the rugby community.  Written inside the sleeve of the England jersey for all England teams is the slogan “England Connected” to remind all players that they are part of one England rugby family.  Players are also encouraged to support each other publically. England captain, Chris Robshaw, regularly sent messages of support via social media to the women’s team for example.  This helps drive media attention and fan support from the men to getting behind the women’s teams also.4.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Finally, England Rugby 2015 Limited (the RFU’s wholly-owned subsidiary established to deliver the Rugby World Cup 2015) has launched “Front Row”.  Fans are encouraged to sign up to receive news first on tickets and volunteering opportunities for the Rugby World Cup.  27% of those who have signed up to date are female, reflecting attendee numbers at Twickenham (4.1).4.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This shows the number of females engaged in rugby is currently far higher than those participating the Game.  Further analysis on the potential barriers of moving from a fan to a participant is below (Section 6). &#xa0;

[[[eadership]]]5.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; At the same time the RFU is committed to ensuring increases in participation in all levels of rugby amongst women and girls, we recognise that we have an important role to play in addressing any real or perceived barriers to women achieving leadership positions in our sport.5.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The RFU as an employer is committed to achieving the National Equality Standard devised by Ernst and Young by 2015.  The current gender ratio of employees is approximately 70% male and 30% female, with initial investigative research indicating that average salaries by grade and gender does not give rise to equality issues.&#xa0; 5.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The RFU is led by an Executive team of nine, including four female Directors which includes Chief Commercial Officer, Sophie Goldschmidt (Case study 5); Legal and Governance Director, Karena Vleck, HR Director, Julia Dell, and ER2015 CEO, Debbie Jevans CBE (Case Study 4).5.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; England Rugby 2015 is a wholly owned subsidiary of the RFU and has been set up to run the 2015 Rugby World Cup.  The gender ratio of employees is currently is 59% male, 41% female. 50% of ER2015’s Executive Team is female with Debbie Jevans CBE (CEO) Joanna Manning Cooper (Director of Comms and Marketing) and Rachel Brace (Head of HR). 5.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The RFU Board currently has three independent non-executive Directors with one female Board member.&#xa0; Price Waterhouse Coopers have made a series of recommendations to increase diversity on the RFU Board and the RFU is committed to responding with a development plan that will aim to increase the potential pipeline of women for these positions.  The RFU wishes to emphasise to the Committee that although setting targets for Board diversity can be helpful, the crucial change is to ensure that there is a healthy pipeline of women coming through the governance structures in sport to feed into positions of leadership in rugby.  &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Case Study 4]]]

[[[: ER2015 CEO, Debbie Jevans CBE]]]Debbie Jevans joined England Rugby 2015 as Chief Executive in October 2012.  Debbie is the first female ever to be appointed as Chief Executive of a Rugby World Cup. Leading the Rugby World Cup 2015 Tournament Organising Committee, Jevans and her team will deliver the third largest global sporting event, hosted in England between September 18 and October 31 2015. Preparations for the Tournament; which will see 48 games played across the breadth of the country, with attendances of over 2 million and an excess of 500,000 spectators travelling into England, are well underway.  Previously Director of Sport for LOCOG, Jevans was part of arguably the most successful Olympic and Paralympic Games in history.  Previously she ran her own sport consultancy firm working with clients such as the International Tennis Federation (ITF), BBC, the International Rugby Board (IRB), International Cricket Council (ICC) and UK Sport.  Debbie is also a member of the All England Lawn Tennis Club’s Committee of Management and Championships Committee and sits on the UK Sport Major Events Panel.&#xa0;

[[[Case Study 5]]]

[[[: RFU Board member, Sophie Goldschmidt]]] Sophie Goldschmidt has been the Rugby Football Union’s Chief Commercial Officer and a member of the RFU Board since July 2011, joining from the National Basketball Association (NBA) where she was Senior Vice President for Europe, Middle East and Africa Operations.&#xa0;The Chief Commercial Officer role at the RFU gives Sophie responsibility for all the union’s commercial programmes in addition to marketing, digital and resourcing. This includes Sponsorship, Business Development, Media Rights, Ticketing, Stadium events, Retail &amp; Licensing, Marketing and Digital, plus all the joint venture operations such as Twickenham Experience Limited (TEL), Marriott Hotel, Virgin Active and England Rugby Travel. &#xa0;5.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The 35 Constituent Bodies of the RFU comprise counties, the three armed forces, Oxford and Cambridge Universities and the England Rugby Schools Football Union.  Each CB elects one or two of its volunteers as members of the RFU Council, and additional rugby stakeholders have the right to appoint members to the RFU Council.  The RFU Council currently has two female members, Deborah Griffin who is the Women and Girls representative (case Study 6) and Tracy Edmundson who represents Notts, Lincs &amp; Derbyshire.  Tracy was the first female Council member to be elected to represent a Constituent Body which is a significant step forward (Case Study 7).5.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In addition, the first female Citing Commissioner was recently appointed by the RFU (Case Study 8).&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Case Study 6: RFU Council Member, Deborah Griffin OBE]]] Deborah started playing rugby at University College London and was a founding member of the WRFU in 1983 and chaired the organisation of the first Women’s Rugby World Cup in Cardiff in 1991. Deborah captained the first English women’s club side at Finchley in its first year and later at Richmond.  Returning as Finance Officer to the RFUW in 2002 and subsequently Chair of the Board, Deborah saw the RFUW to full integration in 2012.  She is also a Bursar at Homerton College, Cambridge University.  Deborah was awarded the OBE for services to women’s rugby in 2011 in recognition of her role in establishing the England women’s side and the women’s World Cup.

[[[Grassroots rugby]]]6.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The RFU sees female participation in rugby as a significant growth area.  The full integration of the RFUW into the RFU means that the RFU’s full resources, including 585 support staff based at Twickenham and around the country, are behind growing the women’s Game at grassroots.   As mentioned previously, Rugby Union will also see a huge spike of interest due to a home men’s Rugby World Cup and rugby 7s entering the Olympic Games in Rio, and the RFU is keen to capitalise on this to increase participation amongst both men and women.6.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Female participation is currently low compared to other sports, but growing rapidly with 

[[[15,000 women and girls playing contact rugby each week, an increase of 90% since 2004]]].  We plan to increase this by a further 10,000 by 2017 through targeted work with 200 of our member clubs across England.6.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 300 rugby clubs in England have a women and girls offering with 60% of clubs offer girls rugby at U13 level, 40% at U15, 30% at U18, 25% at Senior level.  The RFU is working with clubs to review this as the offer in clubs appears to be narrowing at the age spectrum where we want to see higher participation.  These figures suggest significant drop off in their teenage years, and we hope our work with clubs will help us understand why this is happening and what we can do to keep more young women in the Game.6.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The RFU has developed a Women and Girls’ strategy based on extensive research with existing female rugby players, females participating in other sports, and less active females.  The key strands of the strategy are:6.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; For #i &amp; #ii the RFU is focusing on engagement with 200 rugby clubs to identify the challenges clubs face in attracting women and girls, and how these can most effectively be overcome.  More than 50 clubs are part of the Year 1 regional Clusters and are working with the RFU’s field team to increase female participation at their clubs.6.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The RFU also expects to see increases in female participation from the resource we are putting into modified forms of the Game, such as O2 Touch rugby, as our research shows these appeal more to women and girls.  O2 Touch is a join initiative from the RFU and long-standing partner O2, and is part of the RFU’s plans to increase participation in rugby as part of the 2015 Rugby World Cup Legacy.  There are currently more than 50 O2 Touch Centres in rugby clubs and Universities across the country, and by 2014 there will be a further 100. The advantages of Touch is that it is great for fitness, men and women can play together, and the rules are very simple so it is an easy way to start playing rugby – all of these points address barriers to women and girls starting to play rugby.  Of those signed up to the O2 Touch rugby programme, 18% are female.  This is a good start but we aim to increase the proportion of female participants further as overall participation with Touch rugby increases.6.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Grassroots rugby relies on the support of England rugby’s 60,000 volunteers.  The RFU aims to increase volunteering in rugby by both men and women.  The RFU’s development team is working with potential volunteers to identify how the RFU could attract more female volunteers to support their local rugby clubs.  Case Study 9 is on Sophie Morris, a volunteer at Millwall Rugby Club and a great example of how volunteers support our member clubs. 

[[[Case Study 8: Club volunteer, Sophie Morris ]]]Sophie is a Sponsorship and Marketing Consultant and volunteer.  Her involvement in rugby began when she was a Director of Marketing for a Financial Services firm which sponsored the Barbarians games at Twickenham.  &#xa0;In 2012 she wanted to do some volunteer work and searched on a Government website for opportunities and found Millwall Rugby Club.  The Club welcomed her expertise and she was appointed the Development Officer, looking after sponsorship, marketing and press.  Having not played team sport since school, she took up Touch and then moved on to contact rugby, playing for Millwall’s ladies team.  Sophie now sits on the Essex County RFU Development Committee.&#xa0;Among Sophie’s many achievements are increasing sponsorship income to Millwall Rugby Club by more than 500%, and the recruitment of the club’s first ever sponsor of the Ladies team.  Sophie sits on one of the RFU’s six regional Rugby World Cup Activation and Legacy Groups which were set up to capitalise on the opportunity of 2015 to increase participation.&#xa0;All the above roles are voluntary, and Sophie has recently set up her own Marketing consultancy, specialising in rugby sponsorship.  She is keen to promote sponsorship in the women’s side of the Game.&#xa0;7.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There are approximately 2000 community rugby clubs in England and of these 77% have security of tenure over their ground.  The RFU supports clubs through loans, grants and advice to ensure that these facilities are high-quality and well managed.  Clubs will drive increases in female participation and so it is vital that improvements are made to facilities to make them more attractive to women, although facility improvements will of course benefit all participants.7.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Constituent Bodies (governance structure which broadly mirrors county borders) work with local Rugby Development Officers (50 full time RFU employees) to identify the needs of rugby clubs within the context of national priorities.  One of the factors the RFU asks clubs and CBs to consider when seeking investment is the club’s plans for women and girls activity.7.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Research by the RFU and the Women’s Sport and Fitness Foundation found that the main barriers to women and girls playing rugby are the changing and clubhouse facilities.  Between 2003 and 2012 the RFU and Rugby Football Foundation has invested £23.4m of grants and loans in 763 clubhouse projects with a total project cost of £72m, focusing on improved changing facilities and clubhouses. The improvements to clubhouses are designed to meet “RFU Guidance Note 5: Clubhouses and Changing Rooms” which has been developed to produce facilities that meet the needs of all users of rugby clubs (adult, youth and child, male and female). A large number of these projects are focused on supporting clubs to grow the number of women and girls teams as well as male provision, but we do not count them separately. 7.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The RFU plans to 

[[[invest £10m into 500 rugby clubs as part of its Lead Up and Legacy Programme ]]](the RFU’s legacy plan to use the 2015 RWC to grow participation). Changing room improvements remain a key part of this programme and in the first round £600,000 went to eight projects. Round Three of the programme is particularly focused at transforming social spaces in clubhouses with £2.5m investment. The RFU is developing support and guidance for clubs participating in this round to design and furnish these spaces in line with the findings of the RFU’s work with the Women’s Sport and Fitness Foundation.  &#xa0;

[[[8. Rugby in schools]]]8.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The RFU works in schools, colleges and universities to provide opportunities for girls to play rugby.  Encouraging school age girls to play rugby is vital to the future health of the Game in general participation and elite success.  8.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; At primary school age the RFU want to see students receive a broad and balanced PE experience, and then get more opportunities to be involved in sport specific activities and play rugby in Key Stages 3 and 4.  The RFU’s primary focus for delivering schools-based rugby is at secondary level as this is where we can have the bigger impact on participation in encouraging young people to take up and continue playing rugby beyond school age.  8.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There are 3126 schools affiliated to the England Rugby Football Schools Union, many of which have good quality sporting facilities. As part of the Rugby World Cup legacy work, last year the RFU launched the All Schools Programme to help

[[[ more state secondary schools to offer rugby]]] to their students (Case Study 10).8.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The RFU provides coaching, kit, equipment and teacher training, and in a typical year our nationwide community rugby coaches would impact on an estimated 750 secondary schools.   &#xa0;

[[[: All Schools Programme ]]]In 2012 The RFU launched All Schools.  All Schools was founded on the principles that ALL schools can play rugby, ALL of the children in the school can play, and rugby has a positive impact on ALL of the school. &#xa0;The RFU provides tailored support to each school, depending on their needs, challenges and opportunities over a three year period.  The RFU are therefore pleased that 

[[[more than half of the schools in Phase 1 opted to have girls-only or mixed sessions in their schools]]].&#xa0;All Schools is one of seven area areas identified by the RFU to deliver the greatest participation legacy for the game in the lead up to the Rugby World Cup 2015 and beyond.  The RFU has set up All Schools to 

[[[help more state schools that haven’t traditionally played rugby]]] to offer the Game to their students.  We aim to help 400 state secondary schools new to rugby to become self-sufficient rugby playing schools and linked into their local rugby clubs by the 2015 Rugby World Cup.

[[[&#xa0;]]]Schools have been identified in small clusters, allowing them to play rugby against each other locally.  The schools in Phase 1 2012-13 (100) and Phase 2 2013-14 (an additional 100) have been selected on a number of factors including: local rugby club need for young players, proximity to potential RWC2015 venues, and areas of the country that to date haven’t had a large rugby union following.&#xa0;Rugby generates whole school improvement and the RFU encourages coaches and teachers to help youngsters understand and practice rugby’s core values – 

[[[Teamwork, Respect, Enjoyment, Discipline, ]]]

[[[Sportsmanship]]].  Teachers from schools which have participated in Year 1 have reported improving behaviour, enhanced learning and increasing self-esteem amongst students.  &#xa0;Canterbury, the kit partner of England Rugby, is the Official Partner of All Schools.  Each school taking part in the programme is given the opportunity to attend a Canterbury kit design workshop.  The students design their own team rugby shirt, whilst learning about the core values of rugby, the pride associated with the shirt and the importance of colours, logos and emblems, which is made up and presented to the schools at Twickenham.
