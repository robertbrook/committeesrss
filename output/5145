&#xa0;[bold]Written evidence from Cancer Research[bold] UK[bold] [TOB13][bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Declaration of interest(s)[bold]:[bold] [bold]a[bold]bout Cancer Research UK[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Every year around 300,000 people are diagnosed with cancer in the UK and more than 150,000 people die from cancer. Cancer Research UK is the world’s leading cancer charity dedicated to saving lives through research. Together with our partners and supporters, our vision is to bring forward the day when all cancers are cured. We support research into all aspects of cancer through the work of over 4,000 scientists, doctors and nurses. In 2012/13, we spent £351 million on research in institutes, hospitals and universities across the UK. The charity’s pioneering work has been at the heart of the progress that has already seen survival rates in the UK double in the last forty years. We receive no government funding for our research.
[normal]Both genuine and counterfeit cigarettes are extremely toxic products. 
[normal]There are no safe cigarettes and there is no level of safe smoking
[normal].Health damage to smokers is not only determined by the content of the cigarette, but also by the way they are smoked and how deeply they are inhaled. Both genuine and counterfeit cigarettes are extremely toxic products. Highlighting the dangers of counterfeit cigarettes may risk communicating an unintended message that genuine cigarettes are normal and safe. According to British American Tobacco Nigeria for instance, “Tobacco use is risky, but counterfeit cigarettes are lethal”
[normal].   
[normal]Cancer Research UK is currently campaigning for the introduction of standardised packaging of tobacco products, through our own campaign “Setting the Standard” [formerly “The answer is plai
[normal]n”], as well 
[normal]as 
[normal]through the Smokef
[normal]ree Action Coalition.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Comments o[bold]n structure of inquiry[bold]&#xa0;[bold]We are concerned that the sel
[normal]ection of questions for the purpose of the inquiry
[normal] does not fully address the 
[normal]root causes of tobacco smuggling. 
[normal]The
[normal] narrative of the inquiry addresses the
[normal] valid
[normal] issues surrounding enforcement and border controls. It does not however address the 
[normal]critical 
[normal]issue of supply-chain controls 
[normal]and the role of
[normal] tobacco manufacturers themselves 
[normal]who have previously been found 
[normal]to be complicit in tobacco smuggling at various stages of the chain
[normal] (see Public Accounts Committee, 2003
[normal])
[normal]. As our submission develops below
[normal], evidence of continued involvement by 
[normal]tobacco manufacturers in tobacco smuggling 
[normal]continues to emerge
[normal], at a
[normal] time when the tobacco industry 
[normal]are undertaking a large campaign against the possible introduction of standardised packaging.
[normal] Accordingly of partic
[normal]ular concern is the question regarding;
[normal] 
[normal]The possible impact of the introduction of standardised packaging in Ireland on the quantity and availability of illegal tobacco in the UK. 
[normal]In our submission below we explain why Cancer Research UK rejects this 
[normal]explicit link between standardised packaging
[normal] and
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]illegal tobacco
[normal] trade
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Prosecutions and convictions for tobacco smuggling have fallen over the past three years[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The relationship between tobacco smuggling, organised crime and paramilitary activity[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Whether the current sanctions and penalties for tobacco smuggling are appropriate[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Why Border Force failed to meet its operational targets[bold] for tobacco seizure in 2012-13[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The similarities and differences in patterns of tobacco smuggling in the UK and Ireland, how they affect on each other, and the implications of the restrictions on National Crime Agency[bold] operations in Northern Ireland[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The price of duty-paid tobacco products is 
[normal]not
[normal] the most important factor in determining levels of illicit trade
[normal]. Research shows that 
[normal]other factors – principally sharing a border with certain countries where operating an illicit trade is easier – are what 
[normal]is 
[normal]influenc
[normal]ing
[normal] illicit rates
[normal]  
[normal]The Republic of Ireland has the highest rate of tobacco duty in the EU, followed by the UK
[normal].
[normal]The UK has some of the hig
[normal]hest tobacco taxes in the world, with 
[normal]tax accounting for up to 
[normal]88% of the RRP
[normal] on some brands
[normal]. 
[normal]The fall
[normal]ing rate of the illicit market
[normal] has continued despite rising tobacco taxes and consequent high prices in the same period.
