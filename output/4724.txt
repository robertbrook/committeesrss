[[[ (HCS0012)]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1&#xa0;&#xa0; The British Airline Pilots’ Association (BALPA) is grateful for opportunity to submit written evidence to the Committee in support of its inquiry into helicopter safety.1.2&#xa0;&#xa0; BALPA welcomes the Committee’s continued interest in aviation safety, and applauds it for its decision to hold an inquiry to the important and pertinent area of off-shore helicopter safety.1.3&#xa0;&#xa0; However, BALPA believes that an independent judicial inquiry into offshore helicopter safety is required for two principal reasons:1.4&#xa0;&#xa0; The CAA and the helicopter companies have both recently announced reviews, but BALPA does not believe that either of these will adequately assess the role of the oil companies, the amount of control they exert over the helicopter companies and ultimately their impact on the safety of public transport on the North Sea.1.5&#xa0;&#xa0; Nor will these reviews independently examine the adequacy of the “light touch” regulatory regime of the CAA which has demonstrably failed to ensure universally safe standards of operation.&#xa0;2.1&#xa0;&#xa0; Six UK offshore public transport helicopters have been involved in serious accidents during the last seven years. These events happened in 2006, two in 2009, two in 2012, and 2013. In all cases the helicopters entered the water. In two of the cases, water entry took place in a controlled manner following a malfunction contained by a published emergency procedure. These cases had the potential for fatalities due to the hostile nature of the environment. In the remaining four cases, the water entry was inadvertent or uncontrolled. Three of these cases resulted in multiple fatalities.2.2&#xa0;&#xa0; All the accidents have been investigated by the Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB); their investigation into the latest accident is continuing..2.3&#xa0;&#xa0; On 29 November a Eurocopter EC-135 operated by Bond helicopters on behalf of Police Scotland crashed in the centre of Glasgow.  The AAIB is at an early stage of investigation into the cause of this incident and at the current time the cause is far from clear.  Therefore, we will not submit evidence regarding this particular crash at this time, but, with the Committee’s permission, we may seek to submit supplementary evidence if more details are known before the Committee takes oral evidence.2.4&#xa0;&#xa0; All the helicopter companies involved were subject to regulation by the UK CAA and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). 2.5&#xa0;&#xa0; The fatal accident in 2006 Morecambe Bay (Ref 1) occurred due to pilot disorientation and poor monitoring during a visual night approach under low cloud followed by a poorly executed go-around from the approach. The CAA subsequently instructed all operators to review their procedures for night and poor visibility approaches.2.6&#xa0;&#xa0; The next accident in 2009 ETAP (Ref2) occurred due to pilot disorientation and poor monitoring during a visual night approach in poor visibility. The helicopter company had reviewed its procedures in accordance with the CAA instruction above, and deemed them to be robust. The CAA’s evaluation of this internal review failed to establish that the operator’s procedures fell well short of industry best practice. Following the accident, other North Sea helicopter companies made their own operations manuals available to the company involved to allow it to copy best practice into its procedures. The CAA’s oversight of the company’s original Operations Manual is thus open to question, since its contents fell short of industry best practice prior to the accident, and yet were approved by the regulator.2.7&#xa0;&#xa0; The second accident in 2009, an AS332L2 East of Peterhead (Ref 3) occurred due to a catastrophic failure within the helicopter’s main rotor gearbox. The AAIB report found that the operating company had misidentified the origin and composition of a metal chip which had initiated a warning on the gearbox chip detector system. The company had not followed the formal protocol in discussions with the manufacturer and as a result had not complied with the full maintenance procedure following its discovery. It is difficult to understand why, with the company being subject to two simultaneous serious accident investigations out of a fleet of only nine aircraft, the regulator did not consider it necessary to suspend its Aircraft Operator’s Certificate (AOC) pending the conduct of a full investigation of its operations.2.8&#xa0;&#xa0; Both accidents in 2012 (Refs 4 &amp; 5) were as a result of the fracture of a shaft in the main rotor gearbox of EC 225 helicopters operated by two different companies. Whilst the root cause of both accidents was a manufacturing issue, neither company was using industry best practice of downloading and assessing Integrated Helicopter Usage Monitoring System (IHUMS) data after every flight. Had they done so, it is probable that the progressive cracking of the shafts would have been identified in time to remove both aircraft from service prior to the final fractures occurring.2.9&#xa0;&#xa0; The 2013 Sumburgh accident involved an AS332L2 helicopter entering the sea while conducting a non-precision instrument approach in low cloud and poor visibility. The AAIB investigation has yet to be completed, but the interim report (Ref 6) indicates that the aircraft was in a serviceable state, and that use of automation and monitoring procedures were contributory factors.&#xa0;3.1&#xa0;&#xa0; BALPA’s opinion is that in recent years the CAA’s regulatory oversight of offshore helicopter operations has developed into “light touch” supervision as opposed to regulation. This has encouraged the oil and gas industry to introduce its own standards of equipment or in some cases operating limits. For example, one oil company has issued its own height minima for approaches to its installations, which conflict with CAA approved approach procedures. BALPA contends that the regulator has sole authority to approve aviation procedures, and it alone should be setting and maintaining and enforcing the high standards required to maintain safety – i.e. regulating the industry rather than overseeing it.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;3.2&#xa0;&#xa0; Recent events have shown that the lessons learnt from the 1992 Cormorant Alpha accident (Ref 7) have not been universally applied by all helicopter companies including new entrants to the market. As a result of this omission, the common thread of helicopters crashing into the sea whilst conducting approaches in poor visibility and/or at night has continued with the 2006 G-BLUN Morecambe Bay, the 2009 G-REDU ETAP and the 2013 G-WNSB Sumburgh accidents. 3.3&#xa0;&#xa0; Recommendations made by the AAIB to individual helicopter companies with regard to best practice in operations manuals, inflight conditions, stabilised approaches, use of automation and monitoring techniques have received a CAA response “not addressed to the CAA” in follow up reports when the issues were clearly within the Authority’s regulatory purview (Refs 8, 9 &amp;10). BALPA believes that the actions required by these recommendations should have been subject to regular review and enforcement by a robust regulator. Had this been the case, these accidents could have been avoided.3.4&#xa0;&#xa0; While the AAIB investigation into the fatal 2013 Sumburgh accident is still in progress, the initial report describes a sequence of events with marked similarities to the 1992, 2006 and 2009 accidents, despite the approach being conducted under instrument flight rules. This latest example, and the public outcry it has occasioned, has undoubtedly prompted the CAA to initiate its own review into its regulatory activities.3.5&#xa0;&#xa0; The Operations Manuals of all offshore helicopter operators should now be brought up to a common standard with particular regard to the use of automation, monitoring procedures, visibility and cloud base minima and procedures for  the conduct of visual approaches by night and in poor visibility. New entrants to the offshore market should be required to comply with accepted industry best practice. This could be achieved by a helicopter operators’ conference sponsored by the regulator to identify and agree the common criteria and procedures, which would then be incorporated in all operations manuals.&#xa0;3.6&#xa0;&#xa0; As already stated, the AAIB report into the latest accident on 23 August 2013 has not yet been completed, but is likely to involve questions about training which is regulated by the CAA under its approval for Type Rating Training Organisations.3.7&#xa0;&#xa0; A recent trend has developed of helicopter companies outsourcing training and recurrent checking of their crews to third party training providers. This policy is designed to reduce training costs to the operator which is achieved by having the training conducted by ground simulator instructors rather than current operational pilots who are also Type Rating Examiners (TRE).3.8&#xa0;&#xa0; The techniques being taught and checked by these third party training providers must therefore be included in the oversight of best practice in the offshore helicopter industry by the CAA Offshore Inspectorate. &#xa0;3.9&#xa0;&#xa0; In terms of maintenance procedures, the CAA has not required all helicopter operators follow current best practice with regard to advances in IHUMS technology. Specifically, it has not mandated best practice with regard to downloading and analysing IHUMS data after every flight. Had this been the case, it is highly probable that the impending fracture of the gearbox bevel shafts in EC 225 helicopters G-REDW and G-CHCN would have been detected before failure, and hence neither aircraft would have been despatched for the flights on which they ditched.&#xa0;4.1. BALPA believes that regulation of the offshore helicopter sector of the UK aviation industry should be significantly strengthened. The CAA has a recent history of being reactive to accidents rather than pre-empting problems. The required improvement in safety could be achieved by a robust pro-active approach which identifies and enforces industry best practice, takes account of developments in equipment and techniques, and ensures new entrants to the sector match up to the safest standards in operational and maintenance procedures.4.2. BALPA believes that the Flight Operations Inspectorate (FOI) of the safety regulation group of the CAA would benefit from the recruitment of additional inspectors with current experience of offshore helicopter operations, including some with experience of training, to a specialist Offshore Helicopter section of the inspectorate. This would increase the department’s appreciation of the detailed issues involved and enable it to assess the need for improvements to operational standards across the entire industry. The remuneration of these inspectors would have to match that of current North Sea pilots and licenced engineers to enable recruitment of suitably experienced staff to take place. This would mirror the status of the offshore department of the Health and Safety Executive, and BALPA is confident that this would provide a significant net safety benefit.&#xa0;&#xa0;5.1&#xa0;&#xa0; BALPA believes that the oil and gas companies exert an undue influence over the safety of the public transport helicopter sector of UK aviation because they have immense financial customer power, and control the market to ensure very strong competition which leads to a dearth of spare capacity, and encourages cost cutting at the ultimate expense of safety. This is in marked contrast with the Norwegian sector where a strongly dominant national oil company sets high standards, ensures adequate spare capacity is maintained, and where the  international oil companies have to comply to retain their operating licences. The UK is one of the very few significant oil producing countries in the world with no state oil company or sovereign wealth fund. In the absence of a state oil company, the role of the aviation regulator is critical in ensuring safety.5.2&#xa0;&#xa0; Oil and Gas companies in the UK sector have traditionally ensured that a highly competitive market exists for their helicopter support operations. This is managed in 2 ways.a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Firstly, standard contracts are structured in such a way that the oil company generally has a 90 day notice period for termination of contract, whereas the contracting helicopter company is normally tied in to the contract for a period of years. This allows the customer to effectively threaten the helicopter company with a “market testing” exercise at any stage through the duration of the contract, and to pull out of the contract at short notice if their market testing finds another operator to undercut the price. The oil companies frequently use the cyclical nature of the oil industry to impose price cuts on their contractors and service providers. This philosophy encourages the appearance of low-cost helicopter companies who inevitably try to cut corners on safety to achieve their low pricing structure. Many of these small companies are based in other European countries and organise their UK operations using “remote site” regulations which allow them to use their less restrictive Flight Time Limitation (FTL) schemes for competitive commercial advantage. These foreign operators are regulated by their own national aviation authorities rather than the UK CAA which could enforce a level playing field on safety if it had complete regulatory authority over all UK offshore helicopter operations.b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Secondly, the oil companies have ensured strong competition among helicopter operators by providing financial backing to new entrants to the market. 5.3&#xa0;&#xa0; This is best exemplified by a super-major oil company’s funding of a large new entrant to the market in 2004.  BALPA understands that the oil company awarded the new entrant a contract which was heavily front end loaded to enable it to purchase six helicopters and acquire hangar, maintenance, operations and passenger handling facilities at Aberdeen and Sumburgh airports. This major contract allowed the new company to re-enter the market exactly five years after the same owners sold a previous business to a Norwegian competitor with a five year exclusion clause to prevent them setting up a competing enterprise.5.4&#xa0;&#xa0; This sponsorship action was exactly as predicted by the Office of Fair Trading/ Monopolies and Mergers Commission in their decision to permit the merger between British International Helicopters (CHC) and Bond Helicopters into CHC Scotia in 2001. The analysis fails to identify the main reason prices for helicopter services rose after the 2001 merger. This was that following the disappearance of the previous company, wages for helicopter pilots had to rise by nearly 50% over three years in order to stem the dramatic loss of helicopter pilots to the fixed wing jet sector of the aviation industry in the late 1990s and early 2000s. This exodus followed many years of wages depressed by the results of the previous company’s successful business model of building market share by undercutting rival operators on the basis of low wages. 5.5&#xa0;&#xa0; The oil companies also usurp the power of the regulatory authority by setting up “industry bodies” such as Step Change in Safety and the Helicopter Safety Study Group (HSSG) which take the initiative over policy and equipment, (Oil and Gas Producer Aircraft Management Guidelines (OGP AMG)) which they impose through their unequal contractual arrangements. The oil companies are careful to invite the CAA to membership of their HSSG thus giving it some “legitimacy”. BALPA believes that the correct regime would be to have a powerful and proactive UK national regulatory authority which sets common standards of safety which transcend competitive pressures, and mandates safety improvements in equipment and procedures.5.6&#xa0;&#xa0; An example of the oil companies enforcing their own agenda to the detriment of aviation safety was their issuing personal locator beacons (PLB) to “their” helicopter passengers. These PLBs were designed for use by personnel working over the side of offshore installations, and were intended to assist rescue from the water by fast rescue craft with homing devices.  In the case of the 2009 ETAP accident, these small PLBs were initiated by the passengers and interfered with and rendered inoperative the powerful aircraft locating beacons which were part of the mandatory aircraft equipment for the purpose of rescue of passengers and crew. The very short range of these PLBs actually hindered the rescue of those involved in the accident.5.7&#xa0;&#xa0; The reservations of the helicopter operators about the issue of these PLBs to passengers were over-ridden by the oil companies who insisted that they be worn by the passengers as an addition to the mandatory Personal Protective Equipment.5.8&#xa0;&#xa0; It took an AAIB safety recommendation following the ETAP crash before the CAA finally acted despite many Air Safety Reports being rendered by helicopter operating crews over the use and erroneous activation of these devices by the passengers.5.9&#xa0;&#xa0; The oil companies have also fiercely resisted attempts to abolish reliance on mechanical methods (Dacon Scoop) as the sole means of recovery of survivors from the sea in high sea states, and to ensure provision of fire cover on many Normally Unmanned Installations (NUI) in the Southern North Sea.

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;6.1&#xa0;&#xa0; BALPA believes that aviation in the North Sea is necessary to ensure a productive oil and gas sector which has huge positive knock-on effects in the local and national economy.  However, our vision is to make every flight a safe flight. To improve safety BALPA makes the following recommendations:6.2&#xa0;&#xa0; That a full independent public judicial enquiry takes place into the conduct of the offshore helicopter industry with a remit to include:6.3&#xa0;&#xa0; That a separate Offshore Helicopter section of the CAA Safety Regulation Group Flight Operations Inspectorate be established. This section should be staffed by inspectors who have at least five years’ recent personal experience in the large offshore public transport helicopter sector of the aviation industry, and who are remunerated at a level equivalent to senior front line pilots and licenced engineers to allow recruitment from the industry.6.4&#xa0;&#xa0; That frequent and regular reviews of industry best practice be initiated by the CAA in order to keep up with new technology developments, and to ensure that all lessons learnt from accidents and AAIB recommendations are universally applied. In particular, new entrants to the market should only have their Operations Manuals approved, when they have been scrutinised to ensure that they incorporate all the current industry best practice, rather than mere compliance with minimum international standards.6.5&#xa0;&#xa0; That the CAA obtains authority from EASA to regulate the operations of all foreign entrants into the UK offshore helicopter public transport market, to ensure that they meet the same rigorous standards of equipment, operations and maintenance required of the UK based operators.6.6&#xa0;&#xa0; That the CAA mandates downloading of IHUMS data immediately after every flight and analysis prior to the next flight.&#xa0;(1) Air Accident Report 07/2008 G-BLUN Morecambe Bay 27/12/2006(2) Air Accident Report 1/2011 G-REDU ETAP 18/02/2009 (3) Air Accident Report 2/2011 G-REDL East of Peterhead 01/04/2009(4) AAIB Special Bulletin S3/2012 G-REDW East of Aberdeen 10/05/2012(5) AAIB Special Bulletin S7/2012 G-CHCN SW Shetland 22/10/2012(6) AAIB Special Bulletin S7/2013 G-WNSB Sumburgh 23/08/2013(7) Air Accident Report 2/1993 G-TIGH Cormorant Alpha 14/03/1992(8) CAA Follow Up Action on Occurrence Report - Factor Number F12/2008 on AAR 7/2008(9) CAA Follow Up Action on Occurrence Report – Factor Number F7/2011 on AAR 1/2011(10) CAA Follow Up Action on Occurrence Report – Factor Number F9/2011 Issue 2 on AAR 2/2011(11) Ex Post Evaluation of Mergers (Office of Fair Trading, Competition Commission, Monopolies &amp; Mergers Commission) Report by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP dated March 2005.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;8&#xa0; Best practice can be defined by the contents of the AAIB recommendations 050, 051, 054, 055 and 056 on pages 117-118 of Ref 2. These recommendations involve: the use of automation, defined profiles for stabilised approaches, suspension of radar altimeter (radalt) height warnings, defined responses when a radalt warning is activated, and crew monitoring procedures. At least one of the three main offshore helicopter companies had detailed guidance on all these aspects in its operations manual prior to both the 2006 and 2009 accidents, and made these details available to the company involved in the 2009 accident following the event.&#xa0; See analysis in Office of Fair Trading Report March 2005 pages 50-54 (Ref 11).
