"&#xa0;\n             \n        \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Affinity Sutton Group&#xa0;1.0              Work and Pensions Select Committee call for evidence&#xa0;\n1.1\n              \nAffinity Sutton Group is one of the largest \nHousing Associations\n in England\n.\n \nWe work in over 120 local authorities in which we own or manage over 57,000 properties.  These include General Needs, Supported Housing, Keyworker, Leasehold and Part Buy/Part Ren\nt homes\n.\n \nWe welcome the opportunity to \nsubmit evidence to your inquiry into the \nprovision of support to meet housing costs in the reformed welfare system.\n In \nparticular we wish to comment on the social sector size criteria and will focus on the \nimplications of this reform on landlords.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n              \nOur \nbusiness planning \nassumption is that\n \nthe welfare reforms will lead to \nour rent arrears \nto \nmore than double to 9.5% and our bad debts \nto \nmore than quadruple to 3.5% after \n20\n16/17. We estimate that 230 \nAffinity Sutton \nhouseholds will be subject to the benefit cap losing an average of £64 per week which will have an annual \nadditional rent arrears \nimpact on us of £0.7m. We have estimated that the \nsize criteria\n will affect 4,000 of our residents (66% under\n-\noccupying by \none\n bedroom and 34% by \ntwo\n bedrooms) and that this will have an annual impact of £4.2m. Therefore our total exposure from these two changes is estimated \nto cause us to lose income of\n nearly £5m\n pa\n assum\ning\n that \nnone of the shortfall from reduc\ned benefits is made up in other ways.\n &#xa0;\n2.0              Impact of social sector size criteria – unintended consequences&#xa0;\n2.1\n              \nW\ne invest\n heavily \nin our communi\nties \nthrough our Community Foundation which we have endowed with £53m. \nThe current economic climate and cuts to\n welfare have led us to support our residents by helping them into work and helping them manage their money better.\n&#xa0;\nLast year we helped 585 long term unemployed people into work, provided 77 apprenticeships and helped over 1700 take up affordable financial\n products and over 1200 access free debt advice.\n The level of our investment in this work – approaching £4.5m pa – will be exceeded by the loss of income we expect to suffer as a result of the welfare reforms.\n&#xa0;\nMany of our residents are vulnerable and \nwe b\nelieve that \nthe work we do to\n encourage \npeople\n to get involved in their neighbourhood \nis key to the sustainability of our communities. We \nprovide financial\n \nmanagement\n training and advice and \nin response to\n welfare reforms have\n employed \nthree\n \nadditional \nWelfare Benefits Advisors to help residents maximise and manage their income\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nThe shortage of housing in this country is well-documented and in addition to supporting communities Affinity Sutton is committed to delivering affordable homes.  \nUnder our\n \ncurrent housebuilding programme\n (2011-15)\n we \nare building\n \nover 3,000\n \nmuch needed \nnew homes\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n3\n              \nRent is the main source of Affinity Sutton’s income and is essential for maintaining our existing homes\n, supporting our communities\n and building new affordabl\ne homes.  If we are to meet our housebuilding commitments\n and continue to add value to our neighbourhoods\n it is important that we do everything possible to maximise rent collection in a way that gives our residents the chance to pay.  \nFor example, every pound of the public funding we receive to support our affordable housing programme is matched by £6 of private borrowing and other finance that we \nprovide and this debt has to be repaid over time. \nThe timely payment of rent is clearly ex\ntremely important if we are to do so.\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n              \nT\nhe \nfigures\n \nbelow \nshow the\n \nincrease in\n \nAffinity Sutton \nrent arrears since April this year\n for the whole group and for those deemed to be under-occupying\n:\n&#xa0;\nApril 2013 to August 2013                               Arrears               Greatest monthly change&#xa0;\nAll residents\n              \n              \n              \n              \n0.18% \n              \n              \n              \n0.15%\n&#xa0;\nUnder-occupying residents \n              \n              \n1.41%\n&#xa0;\n \n              \n              \n0.59%\n&#xa0;\n2.5\n              \nRent arrears for those who are under\n-\noccupying have\n risen \nover seven times more\n quickly than average\n and \nin a single month increased \nby \nmore than three times \nthe all resident figure for the total five month period.  \nBy transferring the burden from Housing Benefit to Housing Association balance sheets an unintended consequence of this policy could ultimately put the supply of new affordable homes at risk\n; a situ\nation that would see more families reliant on the \nmore expensive \nprivate rented sector and an increase in the cost to Housing Benefit.\n&#xa0;\n2.6\n              \nIt is likely that th\ne\n increase in our arrears would have been \nsignificantly\n worse had it not been for the work of ou\nr \nwelfare benefit advisors and support workers \nwho\n have made 107 successful D\niscretionary Housing Payment\n \n(DHP) \nclai\nms for residents since April\n.\n  \nLocal Authorities have been able to award a greater number of DHP payments\n during this period\n than would usually be the case because they built up reserves over the past few years\n. We fear \nthis increased reliance of households on DHP is not sustainable in the long term.\n&#xa0;\n2.7\n              \nW\ne are \nhelping\n a number of people \nto move to smaller accommodation\n via th\ne mutual exchange route \nwhich allows households to move into a home with one bedroom more than they are deemed eligible for. \nSince April 2013 we’ve completed 449 mutual exchanges\n; largely as a consequence of the shortage of smaller homes,\n 85 of these house\nholds (19%) moved to accommodation which was still too large by one bedroom. A\nround\n&#xa0;\nhalf of our residents who have downsized in this way\n will still be i\nmpacted by a 14% reduction in housing benefit as they move from under\n-\noccupying their home by two or mor\ne bedrooms down to one\n.\n Although residents may be reducing the impact of the bedroom tax by moving in this way, the risk presented to us as a landlord remains.\n \nShould the household find that their financial circumstances deteriorate for any reason\n&#xa0;\n(\ne.g. \nloss of\n job, relationship breakdown\n) or \neven \nthe \nnew \nlower rent \ni\ns unaffordable, any housing benefit \nto which they \nare entitled will \nnot meet their housing costs\n result\ning\n in \npotential \nhardship, rent arrears or both.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.8     \nIn some areas, particularly i\nn the north of England\n,\n we have historically allowed under-occupation of three and four bedroom houses\n. This is both because this is the predominant property type and also\n because we \ncannot\n meet\n \nthe large demand for two bedroom homes\n. Additionally, we try \nto\n actively manage levels of child density, thereby allowing families to grow into a property and help with community stability and cohesion. Most local authority allocation schemes allowed for under occupation by one bedroom for the same reasons. Generall\ny local authorities have now changed their approach to allocating properties to fall in line with the housing benefit changes which came into effect April 2013 and do not nominate households who would under occupy and be affected by the benefit changes.\n&#xa0;\nCo\nnsequently, \ndemand is falling for larger homes in some northern towns and cities (examples are Hull, Bradford, Leeds, \nand Newcastle\n-upon-Tyne). In these locations the local authority \nis\n either struggling to nominate suitable housing applicants or have simp\nly said they cannot nominate applicants for larger homes for the foreseeable future.\n \n&#xa0;3.0              Savings to Treasury of the social sector size criteria&#xa0;\n3.1\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nW\ne are currently \nundertaking a piece of research \nassessing the likely level of savings to Government\n generated by the under-occupation penalty\n. We are working with three\n other social landlords -\n&#xa0;\nRiverside\n, Gentoo and Wigan and Leigh Housing - with support from the Centre for Housing Policy (University of York). Using the DWP’s own savings impact model, \nand re-r\nunning it with data drawn from \nreal experience across the four organisations since April, our initial findings indicate that the level of savings projected by DWP are likely to have been overstated to \na significant extent\n, \npossibly by as much as a \nthird. Despite the generation of savings being one of the Government’s key objectives for the policy, and central to Parliamentary debates during the passage of the Welfare Reform Bill, our study confirms the DWP’s own assessment that \nthere is \n“uncertainty\n about likely claimant and landlord responses to the introduction of the social sector size criteria [which] creates uncertainty about the benefit saving likely to be realised” (DWP 2012 p13). Our work also highlights significant deficiencies in the design\n of the model which are likely to have further overstated the level of savings generated through the implementation of the under-occupation penalty. \n&#xa0;\n3.2\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n This research compl\ne\nments work being undertaken by the National Housing Federation, considering\n indirect costs which should be taken into account in an overall assessment of the financial impact of the policy. These include \npoten\ntial extra net costs to tenants, landlords, local authorities and the voluntary sector such including:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n Whilst it is difficult to quantify these additional costs with accuracy, taken together with the reduced savings discusse\nd above, we believe there is now a powerful case for urgent scrutiny of the £930m two year savings estimate, which has been presented as one of the central objectives of this policy.\n&#xa0;\n26 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
