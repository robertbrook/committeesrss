&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence from Centro On Behalf Of West Midlands Strategic Transport Officers Group (SRN 028)&#xa0;1.              The West Midlands Local Transport Plan has a Key Objective towards Supporting Economic Growth. The West Midlands is located at the heart of the UK strategic highway network with key motorways running through or to our including the M6, M5, M40, M42, M69 and key trunk roads including the A38 and A45/46. 2.              The West Midlands welcomes the investment announced in Action for Roads which will see additional Managed Motorways on the M6 J2-4 and M5 J4a-6 as well the M54/M6/ M6 Toll; A45/A46 Tollbar End junction upgrade. 3.              This will contribute towards our economic growth objectives, support environmental policies and unlock the economic developments as promoted through our Black Country LEP, Greater Birmingham &amp; Solihull LEP and the Coventry &amp; Warwickshire LEP including enterprise zones at i54 in the Black Country and Birmingham city centre as well as Coventry Friargate.4.              Reflecting the dynamic nature of transport networks and the West Midlands location on the national road network, the West Midlands recognises the interaction between the local and strategic road networks and the role of both in supporting and facilitating economic growth. This means the West Midlands takes interest in issues, funding, projects and programmes related to the strategic road network and the Highways Agency as well as the local highway network. 5.              Reflecting the sustainable travel policies of the West Midlands, it is welcomed that the Government has recognised the historic underinvestment in all highways both local and strategic. The West Midlands welcomes that the Government has recognised the need for all highways, to work effectively and efficiently as possible and that highways perform multiple functions as well as private vehicle use, especially sustainable transport modes such as public transport, walking and cycling. 6.              The West Midlands welcomes that the Government has focused on network capacity and efficiency rather chosen to undertake a programme of new roads along with an increase in highway maintenance spending. This is allows the strategic highway network to perform effectively to support the economy whilst minimising physical environmental impacts.7.              However, the West Midlands notes that the Command Paper does not make reference to the M6 Toll or its role on the strategic highway network. It is noted that the M6 Toll is excluded from the outputs of the National Transport Model, demonstrating that if operated correctly, there is a crucial role for the M6Toll as part of the strategic road network and should be specifically included and discussed within Action for Roads. This is discussed further in para 34.8.              This means the West Midlands still suffers from congestion, air pollution, unreliable journeys and hindrance to markets which has national as well as local implications. Such road congestion presently costs the West Midlands £2.3bn per annum whilst as many as 7% of all deaths in the West Midlands are linked to poor air quality with the M6 recognised to be the largest single source of poor air quality emissions in the metropolitan area. 9.              In relation to the local road network, the West Midlands notes that the Command Paper identifies that the local road network makes up more than 97% of all UK roads yet just 8 pages dedicated to them within the document. This disproportionate focus on the strategic road network fails to identify the crucial role of the local network and the considerable opportunities for the local road network to contribute to economic growth, carbon reductions and supporting greater sustainable travel. 10.               The West Midlands notes that the significant disparity between strategic and local highway maintenance. In 2012/13 the Government allocated the Highways Agency £421M approx to maintain the strategic road network which represents 3% of the total highway network. In 2012/13, ITAs and Local Authorities in England were allocated £779M to maintain the large majority of the remaining 97% of the UK roads which also includes pavements, street lighting and other highway assets. The West Midlands believes this Committee should examine the impacts of this issue further.11.              The West Midlands would welcome stronger Government commitment to local road asset management which if suitably funded would generate cost savings for the Government if local highway assets could be maintained through long term planning rather than costly end of life replacement. This would also generate economic benefits and productivity gains to the UK economy.12.              Finally, there is a need to ensure the evidence used to develop Action for Roads is fully tested and would benefit from additional quantitative data.&#xa0;

[[[Q2. How doe]]]

[[[s the Government’s policy for roads link with planning for other transport modes?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]13.              The West Midlands, whilst welcoming investment in the strategic and local highway networks, believes that the DfT needs to fully understand and assess the transport gaps and barriers which mean people and businesses need to drive rather than use public transport. For instance, in the West Midlands some 40% of AM peak trips on the urban sections of the M5 and M6 are for less than three junctions – in effect short hop trips. 14.              These huge numbers of local short hop trips make a major contribution to the traffic congestion of the M5/ M6/ M42 which regularly overspills to cause congestion on the local network causing unnecessary impacts to both the local and national economy and environment. 15.              This demonstrates the need for the Government to ensure an integrated approach to understanding and crucially solving transport problems. The Government is empowering local areas to drive local economic growth and in this context, there is a need for the same locally driven influence and priority to be given to decision making and funding to be applied to the Highways Agency to address transport gaps and barriers to growth. 16.              The West Midlands is of the view that more focus needs to be given to ensuring the Governments policy for roads is integrated so that challenges are addressed by both ‘demand for’ and ‘supply of’ highway capacity.  17.              To that end, it could be considered that in order to address some of the challenges of congestion facing the strategic road network some of the solution should be funded wholly or in part by the Highways Agency. In the West Midlands, investment in a Metro and Rapid Transit network could likely make a major reduction in the 40% of local trips using the urban sections of the M5/ M6/ M42 in addition to our aspirations for junction improvements at the M6 J8, J10; the M5 J1 and J2 and; the M42 J6 all of which are crucial elements to support economic growth and to the development of Strategic Economic Plans by our LEPs.&#xa0;

[[[. How reliable is the Government’s forecast for growth in demand for the strategic road network? How should the Government deal with uncertainty in its forecast? ]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;18.              The West Midlands notes that the DfTs National Transport Model has identified that traffic on the strategic highway network is forecast to grow by 46% for strategic road network and an average of 43% for all roads and 41% for all other roads in the central growth forecast, underpinned by population and economic growth along with technology enhancements to motoring and propulsion. &#xa0;19.              With the West Midlands alone predicted to see an increase of 10% approx in population by 2026, the West Midlands believes the fundamentals underpinning the need to travel are valid. Uncertainty therefore only focuses on the levels of economic growth and future technological transport changes which, if decoupled from carbon fuel sources, could see the cost of motoring decline.20.              The West Midlands believes even with the levels of uncertainty outlined by the DfT, there should be Government concern of the consequences of these forecasts. Even the lowest scenario of growth, traffic would increase by 23% by 2040 with highest range seeing growth of 76% by 2040. 21.              The Government should not look to repeat approach of the past and undertake a ‘predict and provide’ but rather ensure a robust ‘predict, manage and provide’ to ensure investment in alternative transport infrastructure to ensure future road traffic growth is minimised. Investment in rail, buses, walking and cycling will help minimise traffic growth whilst improving access to jobs, improving health, air quality and reduce carbon emissions.22.              The West Midlands would be extremely concerned at the consequence of even just a 23.6% increase in traffic on the M6 through the metropolitan area. Such traffic growth would mean major impacts to our economy, air quality and other pollution and thus to our residents and businesses. 23.              Finally, the West Midlands believes that the DfT should not just focus on the growth and implications of future road traffic growth predictions. The DfT national transport model predicts between 21-54% increases in road traffic which is not part of the Strategic Road Network including the local highways networks. 24.              The Government policy focus should be to ensure this level of growth is minimised and funding is provided to metropolitan areas to develop integrated public transport network to support this growth. Such investment would ensure the ‘double win’ of preventing the economic and environmental impacts of the otherwise predicted traffic growth as well in itself supporting economic growth and reducing environmental impacts to the benefit of residents and businesses located in our core cities and within their economic geographies.25.              Overall, these strategic and local levels of traffic growth would be extremely detrimental to the economic and environment objectives of both the West Midlands and the wider UK. It is crucial the Government ensures a focus on providing the policy framework to ensure the majority of these trips occur in a sustainable manner with a focus on rail for interurban trips and public transport, walking and cycling for local trips. This is likely to involve a balanced approach to supply and demand.

[[[Q4. How can we improve the reliability and efficiency of travel on the strategic road network? What impact will new technology have?]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;26.              The West Midlands has expressed the view that all road travel needs to be viewed and addressed in an integrated manner which addresses supply and demand of road travel. If the need to travel by roads can be addressed through investment in public transport and sustainable transport then it is prudent that those road trips which do occur, are undertaken in an efficient and effective manner. The West Midlands, through the development of both the Local Transport Plan and the Metropolitan Freight Strategy have identified the high priority of journey reliability to personal and freight road journeys. &#xa0;27.              The use of new information technologies has a huge role to play in managing traffic and providing information on all transport modes for end users.  The provision of live and interactive journey planning technologies wedded to the application of new vehicle technologies in integrated systems can make an effective difference, enabling travelers to make informed decisions on what mode of transport to utilise and the most appropriate routes to take.&#xa0;28.              In relation to Managed Motorways, the West Midlands would welcome a long term plan as to where further Managed Motorways should occur. The West Midlands believes there is already a strong rationale for Managed Motorways to be delivered on the M5 between the M6 interchange and M5J4a and between M6 J4 – M6/M1 J19 Interchange with the rest of the West Midlands motorway box been treated with Managed Motorways thereafter. &#xa0;29.              Furthermore, to ensure the on-going effectiveness of existing and future Managed Motorways schemes (and the efficiency of the strategic road network as a whole), targeted investment should be directed towards resolving existing and forecast ‘pinch-points’ on the network.  This is particularly pertinent for circumstances in which those pinch-points act as a barrier to economic development and growth.  &#xa0;30.              For example, investment in M42 Junction 6 would unlock large scale growth of key national, regional and local assets such as Birmingham Airport, NEC, Jaguar Land Rover, Birmingham Business Park and the proposed HS2 Interchange Station and surrounding area.  The scale of growth that could be achieved in relation to these assets, should such investment be made, is highlighted by the UK Central masterplan (http://www.uk-c.com/).     &#xa0;31.              In addition the A46/M69 Corridor provides a strategic north/south link within the West Midlands plays a crucial role in supporting economic growth within the Warwickshire Sub-Region including significant housing growth within the next 20 year local plan period. It provides an alternative routing for vehicles travelling north-south from Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire to the south, avoiding the already congested M42 Corridor. The business cases for the junction improvements at Longbridge and Tollbar End acknowledged the strategic importance of this corridor which can support the connectivity and delivery of High Speed Rail 2.&#xa0;32.              Adoption of the above principles in developing a long term vision would support the aspirations of the Government to allowing the HA to become more independent and allow the DfT to have a strategic policy and funding role akin to the structure of the railways.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[. What mechanisms are there for Government t]]]

[[[o increase investment in strategic roads and attract new investors? Are there good examples from other countries that could be applied in the UK?]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;33.              From the West Midlands experience, there appear to be two models of private financing of new roads. Firstly there is the model used for design build and operate the M6 Toll which has so far not performed as originally intended. This model of financing relied on private companies developing their business models based on assumptions to long range traffic growth forecasts. This meant a high level of risk was built into the model and costed accordingly and with regulation to toll structures or levels. &#xa0;34.              This is the model used for the M6Toll with limited benefits. Our studies suggest that approximately there remains more than 30,000 vehicles per day which pass through the West Midlands (i.e. are strategic in nature) that could otherwise use the M6Toll if the apparent barriers to greater usage were addressed. Tolls appear to be now set at levels to manage MEL debt servicing rather than be aligned to road user needs and encouraging greater usage. &#xa0;35.              The M6 Toll only carries approximately half the 70,000 vehicles per day the road was originally envisaged to carry.&#xa0; In comparison, the M6 carries 125,000 vehicles per day. This adds further weight to our view that the M6Toll needs to be fully utilised and that barriers to greater usage of the M6 Toll addressed to maximise the economic and environmental opportunities for the West Midlands.&#xa0;36.              The second model is to use the concession model once the strategic infrastructure has been built and opened. This allows far greater certainty of risk for actual road usage which is likely to drive a more competitive concession process to the benefit of the tax payer. This model would require the public sector to pump prime the infrastructure with the private sector leasing or even buying the infrastructure thereafter. Once the public sector underwriting period was complete and revenues known, growth and operating costs could be modelled and valued with certainty. The capital raised from the concession could then be recycled to fund other appropriate transport schemes. &#xa0;37.              This model was successfully applied to the 30-year concession on HS1 Ltd which is jointly owned and operated by Borealis Infrastructure and Ontario Teachers Pension Plan until 2040 from which thereafter it is returned to Government for a concession. Crucially this allows for appropriate regulation of user costs.&#xa0;38.              In summary, should the Government wish to better encourage private sector financing for new roads, there appears to be a better balance of risk and costs if this is pursued with the second model identified with the public sector building infrastructure and the private thereafter operating the infrastructure through a concession model.&#xa0;

[[[. How should the Highways Agency be reformed to make it “the world’s leading highway operator”? What roles ]]]

[[[should Government and the private sector play to ensure better management of the strategic road network?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;39.              The West Midlands does not have a view towards how the Highways Agency should be reformed but supports the Governments vision that the Highways Agency needs to have greater autonomy towards decision making and longer term funding certainty akin the governance and funding arrangements between the Government and Network Rail. &#xa0;40.              As highlighted above, it is crucial that the reformed Highways Agency has the duel responsibility to manage daily operations of its network and undertake long term planning to ensure a holistic ‘supply of’ and ‘demand for’ highway capacity. To ensure a fully integrated approach this should include support schemes which reduce demand for the strategic highway network as discussed above. This would have a far closer alignment to the role and responsibilities of Local Highway Authorities who undertake such functions. &#xa0;41.              In order to support and facilitate local economic growth, the Highways Agency needs to be a proactive partner who works with local authorities, developers and others to deliver a strategic road network which can support economic growth. This approach would complement the guidance provided within the recently published Department for Transport Circular 02/2013 ‘The Strategic Road Network and the Delivery of Sustainable Development’. At present the Highways Agency is very reactive, especially in regards to development and impact upon the SRN. Whilst this is understandable for motorway routes, other non-motorway routes could be planned and managed more flexibly to support connectivity to potential development sites.&#xa0;42.              Finally, Government reform should ensure the new Highways Agency has a far stronger relationship with ITAs, LEPs and Highway Authorities to ensure the balanced, integrated approach discussed in this response can be delivered successfully to the benefit of the economy in local areas and across the UK.&#xa0;October 2013Page 1&#xa0;
