"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written evidence from RAC Motoring Services (WRT 020)&#xa0;&#xa0;\n1              BACKGROUND&#xa0;The RAC is the UK’s most progressive motoring organisation and welcomes the \nopportunity to provide evidence to the Transport\n Select Committee as part of its\n review of the resilience of the UK’s transport networks during \nseverely \nadverse winter weather.\n&#xa0;\nThe RAC represents m\nore than seven million members, \nproviding\n services for bot\nh private and business motorists\n,\n and is committed to making driving easier, safer, more affordable and more enjoyable for all road users.\n \n&#xa0;\nWe employ more than 1700 patrols providing roadside assistance in the most extreme weather conditions across the UK\n and\n,\n therefore\n,\n have a good understanding of the impact of adverse weather on the road network. Throughout recent winters, RAC patrols have \nworked alongside the Highways Agency\n, the Police Service \nand other key stakeholders to \nmaximise the safety\n \nof\n road\n users\n \nat risk in\n \ntreacherous conditions. \n&#xa0;\nD\nuring \nperiods of \nsudden snowfall\n, \nwhen roads \ncan \nbecame\n im\npassable\n, and immediately afterwards, when roads remain treacherous because of compacted ice, t\nhe demand for \nroadside assistance \nincreases dramatically. \nDuring the worst periods in recent winters, national demand has risen to levels\n \ntypically \n50\n% \ngreater than is normal for the time of year\n, \nwith demand \nas much as \n100% greater than normal in the worst affected areas.\nIn response to the conditions\n, \nthe \nRAC \nh\nas \nincreased the \nproportion\n o\nf 4x4 patrol vehicle \non its fle\net progressively over the last three\n years. This i\nnvestment has primarily been in\n 4x4 panel vans rather than specialist 4x4 vehicles. We have also issued snow sock\ns\n or snow chains \nfor\n all of our patrol\n vehicles\n,\n whereas historically we have only done so in areas where sever\ne\n winter weather was most common. \n We believe that many other large fleets have made similar investments to improve\n their response to adverse weather\n.\nOur comments a\nre confined to the road network and RAC’s ability to respond to adverse weather.\n&#xa0;\n2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRAC FOUNDATION REPORT ON WINTER RESILIENCE: Ploughing On (published May 2013)&#xa0;\nWe understand th\nat the Committee \nhas\n already \nbeen made \naware of the \nr\neport \n“\nPloughing \no\nn – \nWinter Resilience Review\n”\n \n(\nhttp://www.ra\nc\nfoundation.org/research/mobility/ploughing-on-report\n)\n,\n \nwhich was \nauthored by Brian Smith and \npublish\ned by the RAC Foundation\n in May \n2013\n. \nWe also understand t\nhat the Committee has received \nevidence \nsubmitted by \nthe Foundation that summarises t\nhe main findings of the \nreport.\n RAC \nregards the report as \nfair and accurate and \ncommend\ns\n it to the Committee. \n&#xa0;\nAs part of the \nresearch conducted\n for\n this report, RAC patrols provided feedback on their own experience delivering service during the period January to March 2013 when the worst of the 2012/13 winter conditions were experienced. Specifically:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe report also states: “\nWithin \nfree text comments\n \nthat also made up the response, \nthere were\n \nseveral observations that drivers appeared not to have heeded weather warnings and had been caught out, or unprepared, and that many of the stranded vehicles were not suitable for driving in the \nextreme weather \nconditions. There were also concerns about p\noor driving and lack of experience/skills for the \nroad \nconditions. There were a large number of comments about the number of potholes in all types of road, and the observation that they are particularly dangerous when it has snowed, because they cannot be \nseen.\n”\n&#xa0;\n3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGENERAL RESILIENCE OF THE ROAD NETWORKRAC believes that the ability of the Highways Agency and local authorities to respond to adverse weather and keep the roads operation\nal in the most extreme weather \nhas improved since \n2009/10. The recommendatio\nns of the Quarmby report have generally been implemented and \nhave delivered the \npredicted\n benefits\n. Salt stocks have not run out. Major roads are generally treated in a timely way, but patrols report that the effectiveness with which local roads are kept p\nassable still varies hugely from area to area depending on the priority given to this by local authorities. RAC patrols often have to attend customers on\n minor rural\n or residential roads so this does inhibit service delivery\n.\nT\nhe Highways Agency \nhas been s\nuccessful in keeping\n \nthe strategic road network functioning\n. The only exceptions have been geographically localised and in highly unusual \ncircumstances\n.\n&#xa0;\n4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFORECASTING OF ADVERSE WEATHER&#xa0;RAC is\n best able to respond to adverse we\na\nther when \nthe organisation \nhas\n \nsufficient\n wa\nrning\n to adjust resourcing levels\n. Five\n-day weather forecasts \nproved to be \nreasonably \naccurate and predicted the adverse weather in the 2012/13 winter. \nIn contrast\n, \n16-\nday forecasts were insufficiently accurate to justify commitment of ext\nra resource. \nFive\n days provide\nd\n only limited opportunity to adjust working shifts and relocate patrols into areas where demand \nwas\n likely to be greatest.\n \nThe\n ability\n, therefore, \nto predict adverse weather a mini\nmum of two\n weeks ahead would significantly im\nprove RAC’s ability to respond. We anticipate that other organisations \nfacing similar challenges \nwould benefit from improved longer term \nweather forecasting\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPOTHOLES AND ROAD MAINTENANCE &#xa0;\nThe formation of \np\notholes \nhas been accelerated by\n three\n successive\n harsh winters\n and\n \nhas \nhad a large\n and sustained\n \nimpact on \nthe state of our roads\n across the country.\n \nThis \nhas resulted in added risk to the safety \nof \nmotorists \nand their vehicles, \nparticularly for cyclists. These risks are increased when pothol\nes become invisible when roads are flooded or covered by snow. \n&#xa0;\nM\notorists regard\n \nlocal road maintenance\n as the top priority in transport\n spending and this year there ha\nve\n been \nnumerous \ncalls \nfor local authorities to improve \nthe speed and effectiveness of \npothole repairs. The Department for Transport has provided valuable guidance on addres\nsing the practical problems of p\notholes in the Highways Maintenance Efficiency Pro\ngramme Report “Prevention is bet\nter than cur\ne – Pothole Review” published i\nn April 2012\n.\n&#xa0;\nIn 2013 the RAC’s Report on Motoring found that:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThis dissatisfaction \nis greatest\n in \nrural areas \nwhere the \nquality\n of local\n \nroads appears to be getting much\n \nworse\n,\n \naccording to\n \n87% of respondents. \n \n&#xa0;\nThe RAC \nhas called on the \nGovernment to\n \nensure more of the \n£ \nmotoring taxation\n \ncollected centrally by the Treasury\n, which totals in excess of £40 billion p.a., \n is\n \nmade \navailable to\n local authorities to fund the\n \nmaintenance of local roads.\n RAC a\ncknowledges that \nthe \nGovernment made additional funding available to address the problems of potholes\n,\n but \nthis has not had the desired outcomes and it seems likely that \nin some ca\nses \nthis funding has been used to \nreplace, rather than supplement,\n funding from local budgets \nto address local roads maintenance\n. Earlier\n this\n year\n,\n \nRAC \ncalled\n on the Government to\n \ncarry out an \naudit \nof the\n \nwork required to \nbring \nthe\n \nUK’s roads \nto a state \nthat is fit for purpose and prioritise the funding required to achieve this objective over a realistic timescale.\n&#xa0;\n6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIN SUMMARY&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;October 2013\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
