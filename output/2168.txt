[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;1.1              The English Golf Union merged with the English Women's Golf Association on 1st January 2012 to form England Golf, the governing body for all amateur golf in England.&#xa0;1.2              England Golf is one of the largest sports governing bodies in England looking after the interests of over 1,900 golf clubs and 770,000 men and women club members.&#xa0;1.3              Responsible for the training of the country’s top amateur golfers, England Golf also organises all the major English amateur championships. England Golf works to actively encourage new golfers and increase the continued interest and participation in golf through its golf development initiative ‘Get into golf’.  England Golf also maintains a uniform system of handicapping, administering and applying the Rules approved by the Council of National Golf Unions.&#xa0;1.4              England Golf is currently consulting with its stakeholders on developing a strategic plan 2014 to 2017 and it is expected that the development of women and girls golf will be a key theme that emerges from this process.&#xa0;1.5              England Golf is a member of the England Golf Partnership (EGP) together with the PGA and supported by the Golf Foundation and Sport England.  The Whole Sport Plan (WSP) for golf identifies how England will achieve its vision of becoming ‘The Leading Golf Nation in the World by 2020’ from grass roots right through to elite level.&#xa0;&#xa0;2.1              According to the Sport England Active People Survey (June 2013), 105,100 females play golf once a week and 151,400 on a monthly basis; between 12% and 14% of the total participants within golf.&#xa0;2.2              In terms of affiliated membership (2012 figures), there are 107,037 females who are members of an affiliated golf club in England.&#xa0;2.3              Grass roots development programmes that are delivered through the network of County Golf Partnerships (CGPs) attracted over 86,764 participants into golf between April 2012 and March 2013; the proportion of female participants was 44% which exceeds the current profile of all participants within golf.&#xa0;&#xa0;3.1              There are currently 1,944 golf clubs affiliated to England Golf (September 2013) with the majority providing playing, coaching and membership opportunities for both females and males.  There are approximately 22 affiliated golf clubs where membership is only open to women (by comparison there are 4 golf clubs where membership is only open to men).&#xa0;3.2              England Golf has an accreditation scheme called GolfMark (incorporating Sport England Clubmark) that identifies beginner and junior friendly facilities.  There are currently 650 affiliated golf clubs in possession of this award and a further 450 working towards obtaining it.  The criteria for a club to obtain GolfMark is split into four main areas, all of which assess on the basis of opportunities for women and girls and men and boys.  GolfMark facilities become focus clubs within a county to work in partnership with and for potential investment to help drive participation and membership through women’s specific and/or family sessions for example.  See www.golfmark.org for more detail.  &#xa0;3.3              At elite level, England Golf provides 6 women’s national championships and 3 girl’s national championships and the number of participants within these events totals 1,024 participants (compared to the equivalent events for males which totals 1,248 participants).  Below national level, there are many competitive opportunities for women and girls at county and club level.&#xa0;3.4              From an elite coaching perspective, England Golf has squads for both women and girls.  In total there are 10 women and 7 girls in the national performance squads that utilise 5 different training facilities and also warm weather training.  There are also coaching opportunities at an earlier stage of the talent pathway, which in addition to 35 county coaching squads, there are 10 regional performance squads (consisting of a maximum of 8 players per region).&#xa0;&#xa0;4.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Please note, England Golf only run events for amateur golfers and therefore there is no prize money available at these events.&#xa0;&#xa0;5.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Although we do not have specific statistics on media coverage, England Golf delivers specific content for female participants through a variety of media, including web, social, magazine, e-newsletters and the ‘Get into golf’ marketing campaign (see also paragraph 6.6).&#xa0;&#xa0;6.1              The opportunity to increase the number of women and girls participating within golf is potentially a significant growth area and England Golf believes that this can be achieved by delivering nationally co-ordinated programmes focusing on recreational, social and family aspects, whilst ensuring that there are accessible and affordable exit routes into golf club membership for those participants that wish to sustain their engagement with the sport.&#xa0;6.2              England Golf has previously conducted research into the barriers and motivations of market segments playing golf and this has provided valuable insight.  Whilst across all segments the main barriers highlighted were time, cost and perception; within the female segments the emphasis was more about not knowing what opportunities were available to them and how golf can better communicate and market the sport.&#xa0;6.3              The research highlights the importance that England Golf places on understanding the requirements of female segments and the ability to act upon the findings.  In addition to implementing a specific women’s marketing campaign, County Golf Partnerships now focus on delivering group taster and structured sessions for similar abilities at targeted facilities that are friendly, accessible and affordable. &#xa0;6.4              Many women and girls view golf as male dominated and feel self-conscious; women only groups are an ideal way to learn and support each other, it is also important that participants experience playing the game from the earliest opportunity (as opposed to just receiving coaching sessions).&#xa0;6.5              Based on examples of best practice and in particular an extremely successful women’s programme called ‘Here come the girls’ run at Fynn Valley Golf Club in Suffolk, the following factors are vital:&#xa0;&#xa0;6.6              The national ‘Get into golf’ marketing campaign (see www.getintogolf.org) provides information for new golfers and returners to experience a variety of opportunities.  The campaign engages with different organisations to target groups of women, including networks such as the Women’s Institute (WI) and Mums in the Know; working with other sports for example British Cycling’s Cycletta events; online magazines including www.sportsister.com and the NHS.&#xa0;&#xa0;7.1              England Golf works closely with the Golf Foundation (a charity committed to the sporting and social development of young people through golf) through the England Golf Partnership to provide opportunities for young people, specifically those within schools.&#xa0;7.2              The Golf Foundation delivers its operational activity through a single programme - HSBC Golf Roots - and aims to achieve its mission by supporting community and city projects.  Through the community projects the Golf Foundation supports school and school/club link activity and includes delivery in primary schools (Tri-Golf), secondary schools (Golf Xtreme) and in clubs (outreach work).&#xa0;7.3              The number of schools now offering some form of golfing activity has significantly increased since 2005/2006 and Golf Xtreme within secondary schools has been particularly effective in attracting girls to have a go at golf, due to the social aspect of the programme and also there is no requirement to get changed into PE kit which can sometimes be a barrier in itself.  Recent Sportivate data for 2012 to 2013 highlighted that 2,757 young people had engaged across 248 golf programmes, of which 31% were female.&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
