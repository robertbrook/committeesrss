[[[Introduction]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1              Transport for London (TfL) welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the               Committee’s inquiry into winter resilience in transport. &#xa0;1.2              Our organisation and London Councils, the body representing all the London boroughs and the City of London, have well-developed plans, prepared alongside the emergency services and Network Rail, to keep the transport network open throughout severe weather.  As well as the Capital’s road network, this includes roads and footways linking to bus garages and bus stations, railway and Underground stations, hospitals, and police, fire and ambulance stations across the city. During periods of severe weather, TfL and borough staff will work around the clock across London Underground (LU), and our bus, rail and road networks to minimise disruption during adverse winter weather conditions.  &#xa0;1.3              Salt is stockpiled by us and the boroughs to ensure that all road users can            continue to move around the Capital. A fleet of road gritters will be deployed               to keep the roads clear and arrangements are in place to enable the               boroughs to share salt stores, if necessary. A pan-London Strategic Salt            Reserve is also available should               replenishment arrangements via the normal            supply chain be disrupted.  Where exceptional rainfall is forecast, heavy duty            pumps are placed on standby to react to localised flooding, so as to keep our            main road network operable.&#xa0;1.4      De-icing trains will be in operation, keeping tracks as clear as possible;               platforms will be gritted and lineside equipment, including point motors, will be   checked. Staff and contractors are used to keep the platforms and Tube station areas clear and de-iced. Network Rail, whose tracks are used by certain Underground services and which manages most of the infrastructure used by London Overground, also works closely with us to prepare the network for winter conditions.&#xa0;1.5              Londoners and visitors to the city should check our website, particularly during periods of severe weather to help them plan ahead and to get travel information on the move.&#xa0;1.6                We have developed our contingency plans, including lessons learned from previous winters, to ensure that London’s road and rail operations are able to maintain a good level of service for their users.&#xa0;1.7              Each part of TfL (Roads, Buses, LU and London Rail) has an operational plan for winter including snowfall and sub-zero temperatures.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Roads and Buses]]]&#xa0;Weather forecasting&#xa0;2.1      We have weather forecasting contracts in place for our networks, and which are specific to the affected modes.  &#xa0;2.2              Duty officers in our Surface Transport Asset Management Directorate take               action on the basis of data provided by a weather forecasting service from            MeteoGroup and from our own weather station information. During severe            winter weather, a ‘snow desk’ is established in our London Streets Traffic            Control Centre (LSTCC) to coordinate salting and snow ploughing operations            and to liaise with the boroughs and CentreComm, our control centre for            London Buses. &#xa0;Operational processes&#xa0;2.3              Roads – we are responsible for the treatment of all of London’s Red Routes, a               network of 580km.  Throughout winter, a fleet of 40 gritters, all of which can               be fitted with ploughs, as well as gritting quad bikes, flat bed trucks and teams               of operatives are on standby for deployment across the network. We have            agreed with the boroughs a list of core bus routes, bus garage locations and            bus stands to ensure bus services can be maintained.&#xa0;2.4              Most highway authorities have gritting networks which are prioritised by use, with both the Transport for London Road Network (TLRN) and the Strategic Road Network (SRN), are treated as high priority. The frequency and type of treatment is dependent on prevailing and forecast weather conditions to ensure the entire network remains operable. Reports of the planned treatments are sent to stakeholders.&#xa0;2.5              Priority routes for gritting are also published on our website and include               main roads, bus routes and roads leading to fire stations and hospitals, etc.                Pavements in busy areas will also be treated to help pedestrians and support               local businesses.  A pan-London Strategic Salt Reserve is also available for               us and the boroughs should supplies become low during the winter. &#xa0;2.6              Buses – our objective during periods of heavy snow is to help maintain many routes running as normal a service as possible, providing passengers with a safe journey to their destinations. Contingency planning is reliant on working closely with bus operators, the LSTCC and our Asset Management Directorate when requesting or receiving priority gritting or snow clearing requests on the TLRN. It also relies on close contact with the London Local Authorities Coordination Centre (LLACC) and individual Borough Winter Teams to ensure that as full gritting coverage as possible is            maintained on borough roads.

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.7              Cycling – we have produced guidance regarding winter clothing and reflective               safety equipment and advise all cyclists to take extra care while cycling during               winter months. &#xa0;2.8              The Barclays Cycle Hire scheme and Cycle Superhighways fall within the               winter contingency plans of the TfL Asset Management Directorate and the            Borough Winter Teams as explained above.

[[[ ]]]&#xa0;2.9              Our London River Services division maintains stocks of salt to ensure that               pedestrian access areas on the approaches to its piers are maintained for               safe use of passengers. Access roads to the Woolwich Ferry terminal are               maintained under the winter service plans of our Roads team. &#xa0;2.10              Dial-a-Ride and Victoria Coach Station both maintain stocks of salt which are               used to maintain use of their facilities. &#xa0;Treatments and de-icing&#xa0;2.11              The highways winter service is operable between 1October and 30 April.            Treatment plans are maintained by our Roads Directorate. These are             reviewed and optimised  annually with input from across our organisation as             well as from external stakeholders including boroughs. &#xa0;2.12              The winter season started on 1 October and as of that date we are ready            to treat the network with plant and materials standing by. Our salt stock levels            have been revised in accordance with national guidance and we now have a            contracted minimum stock level, sufficient to treat the network 90 times, which            equates to a minimum stock of some 10,000 tonnes. Current stock levels            stand at approximately 14,400 tonnes, giving an operational buffer of 4,400            tonnes.  Stock replenishment will be undertaken during the season so as to            maintain an operational buffer and only in continual severe conditions will           there be a risk of stock levels falling below the minimum 10,000 tonne            requirement. Salt usage through the winter will obviously depend on the            conditions that ultimately develop.&#xa0;2.13   As risk mitigation against in season shortage of salt from suppliers, TfL has           established a pan-London Reserve Salt Stock of 27,000t, held at Dagenham,           available to ourselves and the boroughs. This is to be used as a last resort          after all supply chain or options for mutual aid between neighbouring           authorities have been exhausted. With prudent use that should be sufficient to           treat London’s key ‘resilience’ routes for a period of about two weeks.&#xa0;Command and control&#xa0;2.14              We use the ‘Gold’, ‘Silver’, ‘Bronze’ structure. This relates to the role that each person within the command structure will play as opposed to ‘rank’, the roles being Strategic, Tactical and Operational respectively. It mirrors the structure utilised by the emergency services and is used by senior managers across TfL on a regular basis for major planned events. The same command structure is also utilised by the Metropolitan Police’s Safer Transport Command and Traffic Operational Command Unit whose operations centre, Metrocomm, is co-located with our Surface Transport Traffic Control Centre in Palestra.  &#xa0;2.15              We have agreed activation and communications processes with the LLACC,               which is managed by London Fire Brigade Emergency Planning.&#xa0;Testing &#xa0;2.16              TfL ‘live’ tested our contingency responses to severe snow conditions on            the road network over two recent winter seasons with our Roads and Traffic            Directorates establishing a ‘snow desk’ for direct communication lines for            priority gritting requests. Lessons learned from this approach have been            incorporated into our procedures. During recent years an annual workshop            facilitated by the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority (LFEPA) has            been carried out with the London boroughs, the emergency services and            ourselves to share lessons learned and best practice. We facilitate and co-              chairs regular meetings of the London Winter Service Practitioners Group, (a            LoTAG sub–group) to share best practice and operational experiences in            anticipation of forthcoming adverse weather conditions.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[London Underground and TfL’s rail network ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Weather forecasting&#xa0;3.1              TfL’s rail network and LU use the Met Office to predict levels of snowfall and ice accumulation as well as our own network-wide rail temperature equipment. To complement this, MeteoGroup provide a forecast rail icing risk at over 20 locations over the LU network (the locations each have instrumented sets of rail for temperature and moisture, which give real time data). London Rail collects local temperature information from defined cold spot locations. This information triggers the response plans as appropriate.&#xa0;Operational processes&#xa0;3.2              LU and London Rail work on five day readiness process for a predicted forecast of snow and a similar three day readiness process for ice, both of which aim to minimise the impact of the forecasted weather.  All affected rail routes are pre-emptively treated in the hours leading up to and then during winter weather conditions in accordance with pre-determined plans. Where routes are affected, contingency plans are in place to divert customers and curtail rail services to concentrate on priority locations. &#xa0;Gritting and de-icing&#xa0;3.3              Docklands Light Railway grit stocks are managed by the operator, Serco. The company has detailed plans for grit/salt requirements, based on past experience. The main use is around stations, but depot walkways and external paths around office accommodation are treated. Grit orders are placed in August/September each year. On the platforms ‘Killfrost’ is also used and the required supplies have been ordered. &#xa0;3.4              London Tramlink has already purchased the grit/salt it plans to use this year.               It purchased its own dedicated gritting equipment in 2011. &#xa0;3.5              On London Overground, the operator, London Rail Operations Ltd (LOROL),               is responsible for gritting or ‘Icemelt’ applications at most of the stations. For               other infrastructure, Network Rail is responsible and there is close liaison               between LOROL and that organisation. &#xa0;3.6              For LU, arrangements are in place for mutual aid with regard to gritting those               vulnerable areas of streets outside stations and for train depot entry roads.               This supports safe access to station and depot               roadways, car parks and staff               walkways outside stations.&#xa0;3.7              An audit of de-icing supplies (both materials and tools) at each station is               completed annually in September and orders are placed for replenishments.                Contracts are in place to continually replenish stocks throughout the season               (within 24 hours of station reporting use), with buffer stocks held at strategic               locations across the network.  &#xa0;3.8              On both LU and London Rail infrastructure, de-icing fluid is laid by specially adapted trains. This activity is triggered by temperature and precipitation levels in the forecast.  These are tested prior to the season. Each Underground line’s stock is typically equivalent to around one week of intensive use, with contracts in place for supply of more fluid at short notice.&#xa0;3.9              If snow is forecast, contracts are in place to obtain around 200 additional staff per shift to keep walkways clear,               allowing the full time staff to concentrate on specialist areas (such as critical sets of points). The Train Operating Companies have similar contracts. &#xa0;Command and control&#xa0;3.10              LU and London Rail also use the ‘Gold’, ‘Silver’, ‘Bronze’ structure. The LU Control Centre, located in Palestra, alongside its equivalent Surface Transport Operations and Control Centre (STOCC), allowing greater ability to               provide a co-ordinated communication and command strategy across all transport modes.&#xa0;Testing &#xa0;3.12              LU restructured its planning systems in 2012 and this               provides extensive               opportunities for testing. Going forward, network plans will be tested annually               after their pre-winter review. Within regions on the network, plans are tested               on a ‘walk through’ basis a number of times prior to the winter.  A pre-season               audit is carried out to ensure the preparation of the actions in the winter plan               is progressing to programme.

[[[ommunication ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.1              Our Press Office has a media strategy in place for severe winter weather               which includes travel information published on our website, newspapers,               televised feeds and social media. &#xa0;4.2              Dealing with communications processes across London, and particularly how &#xa0;&#xa0;         information is given to customers about our services, National Rail services &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;  and Highways Agency infrastructure, has been further developed following            the 2012 Games.&#xa0; Apps for passengers are being developed utilising TfL                data, via third parties, and strategies for communication and public            information being devised for pre-planned and anticipated events, which            includes adverse weather. Disruption to National Rail services creates            additional demands for our own operations as passengers switch to             alternative routes. Better communication with Network Rail and the Train                         Operating Companies, with an emphasis on media messages, and advance             notification will mitigate this. &#xa0;4.3      The value of multi-agency collaboration was clearly demonstrated by the            success of the Transport Coordination Centre (TCC) during the 2012 Games.            Since then we have improved the way we work with Network Rail and            other operators and have created a multi-agency coordination centre,             modelled on the TCC, available to facilitate collaborative operational and            communications responses where required.&#xa0;

[[[earned ]]]&#xa0;5.1              Following the severe weather in February 2009, TfL with the London               Technical Advisors Group, set up a highways winter service project               board.               We facilitated a pan-London workshop which was attended by all London               boroughs. From this workshop and other meetings following the winter of               2009/10, London was one of the first areas in the UK to develop a               carriageway treatment resilience network. This is a sub-set of the main            treatment networks, coordinated between boroughs to allow the most            important roads, including key bus routes, to operate when salt stocks are            low. This network proved essential in managing the allocation of salt during            the winter of               2009/10. At that time TfL, through our contractors, managed the            distribution of salt supplies coming into London.&#xa0;5.2              We have also taken an active role in the Priority Gritting Request Review               which includes participation from the LLACC, Local Authority Winter Service               Managers, the London Fire Brigade and London Ambulance Service. &#xa0;5.3              LU continues to work closely with Network Rail, Train Operating Companies, the Highways Agency, London boroughs and with other bodies. Key stakeholder engagement is also maintained via the London Resilience Forum with data being shared through a number of sources such as the National Resilience Extranet and the Transport Sector Panel which is chaired by our Head of Resilience Planning.&#xa0;5.4              Lines of communication with the Highways Agency have been improved since               a particular problem on the M25 in winter 2010/11 and the Highways Agency               has taken steps to improve resilience on its network. &#xa0;

[[[Conclusion]]]&#xa0;6.1              We continue to work closely with colleagues in a variety of agencies, including               the London boroughs, to ensure our networks are able to operate safely and               reliably and to keep the Capital moving during severe winter weather.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;October 2013                                                  Local Government Technical Advisers’ Group
