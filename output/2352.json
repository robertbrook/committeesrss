"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Renfrewshire Council 1.1.\n \n              \nRenfrewshire Council continues to express concerns that the reforms to support for \n              \nhousing costs being considered by this inquiry will exacerbate poverty for the most \n              \nvulnerable individuals and families. \n1.2.\n \n              \nThe Renfrewshire area includes the Ferguslie area of Paisley, the single most deprived \n              \ndatazone in Scotland (see the Ren\nfrewshire c\nontext - Appendix 1\n, A). This area and \n              \nother more vulnerable communities in Renfrewshire already face significant challenges \n              \nand the measures being introduced by the UK Government will lead to increased \n              \nfinancial stress for households and create additio\nnal service pressures arising from \n              \ndemand for welfare, debt and money advice, additional family distress and increased \n              \nhomelessness presentations.\n1.3.\n \n              \nFrom the Council’s perspective there are clear financial risks relating to the \n              \nmanagement and sustainabil\nity of the Housing Revenue Account (HRA). These are \n              \nlinked to increases in rent collection costs and bad debts associated with an increasing \n              \nrequirement to collect rent as a result of reducing benefit levels available to tenants and \n              \nproposals for housin\ng benefit payments to be made directly to the claimant under the \n              \nproposed Universal Credit system.\n1.4.\n \n              \nAdditionally, the Council is concerned that the make up and availability of housing stock \n              \nat local authority level does not appear to have been taken into\n account when \n              \nintroducing the under \noccupancy reduction. (Appendix 1\n, B) refers. This places \n              \nsignificant challenges for social landlords, including Renfrewshire Council where there \n              \nis a mismatch between the housing requirements of tenants affected by th\ne under \n              \noccupancy reduction and the benefit cap and the availability of suitably sized stock. \n1.5.\n \n              \nRenfrewshire Council anticipates a number of potential impacts on its statutory duty in \n              \nrelation to homelessness as a result of the Housing Benefit changes. I\nn particular, the \n              \napplication of the under occupancy reduction to local authority owned stock used to \n              \ntemporarily accommodate people presenting as homeless, while exempting other \n              \ntenures of property used, does not recognise the effective use that is mad\ne of LA \n              \nowned accommodation to meet such emergency accommodation needs.  The loss of \n              \nhousing benefit and the resulting increase in rent arrears may ultimately lead to \n              \nincreased housing benefit costs as the council may be forced to consider greater use o\nf \n              \nthe private sector provision, where rent levels may prove to be higher, in order to meet \n              \nits statutory duties in relation to homelessness and protect against financial loss to the \n              \nCouncil. \n1.6.\n \n              \nThe proposed introduction of direct payment of housing costs\n within Universal Credit is \n              \nexpected to lead to greater financial stress for households and individuals and will place \n              \nextreme financial pressures on the long term sustainability of social housing where \n              \nhouseholds are unable to budget appropriately and \nmanage the ongoing responsibility \n              \nof sustaining their rent payments.\n2.1.\n \n              \nRenfrewshire Council has deployed significant additional r\nesources of £1.3 million in \n              \n2013/14 and beyond to provide the Council with the best opportunity to prepare for and \n              \nmanage the anticipated increase in demand for services. Much of this investment is \n              \ndirected towards advice and support to ensure the Counc\nil is well placed to both \n              \nsupport the tenants and their families manage the impact of welfare change, but also to \n              \nseek to pro-actively protect the financial position of the Council’s housing function, in \n              \nparticular the sustainability of its rental strea\nm during this transition.\n2.2.\n \n              \nRenfrewshire Council has formally recognised that where tenants subject to the under \n              \noccupancy reduction are actively engaged with the Council and are taking reasonable \n              \nsteps to maintain a rent repayment arrangement the council\n will continue to pursue rent \n              \ndue without resorting to eviction. However, it needs to be recognised that increasing \n              \nrental arrears ultimately places significant financial pressures on the Council’s Housing \n              \nRevenue Account which will in turn increase the\n associated future rental costs for social \n              \nhousing within Renfrewshire. \n2.3.\n \n              \nIn recognition of this, the Council has in addition,  agreed to set aside £850,000 from \n              \nthe Housing Revenue Account (HRA) for 2013/14 to help mitigate the impacts of \n              \nwelfare refor\nm on Council tenants, part of which will be targeted at providing a scheme \n              \nof financial support for tenants experiencing hardship. Given the close links with the \n              \nDepartment for Work and Pensions (DWP) Discretionary Housing Payment (DHP) \n              \nscheme, options \nfor criteria for the HRA financial hardship support scheme are being \n              \ndeveloped taking account of the circumstances and outcomes of applications made by \n              \ntenants for DHP. However, it is recognised that both schemes will provide only \n              \ntemporary support and \nrelief for affected tenants.\n2.4.\n \n              \nIn addition, Renfrewshire Council has increased its top up funding to DHP resources by \n              \n150% by allocating an additional £150,000 to the DHP fund for 2013/14 in recognition \n              \nthat the DWP resources are insufficient to provide t\nhe necessary short term support to \n              \naffected citizens across Renfrewshire. The Council administration is proposing to \n              \nfurther enhance the fund up to the maximum allowable at the C\nouncil meeting \n              \nscheduled for 3\n October 2013. The enhanced fund will help de\nfray the loss of \n              \nHousing Benefit and provide tenants with short term support that will allow them to \n              \nmeet their rent obligations while considering other options.\n2.5.\n \n              \nThe integration of housing officers to neighbourhood area housing teams has also been \n              \ntake\nn forward by the Council in order to support ongoing tenancy management \n              \nactivities. Officers continue to take proactive measures to support tenants affected and \n              \nwe have increased the number of officers available to offer advice and assistance, \n              \nincluding\n specialist money advice to make sure that tenants have access to good \n              \nadvice and support.  This includes maximising any opportunity to access benefit \n              \nentitlement, support access to any possible financial support funds in place, and also \n              \ncovers repaymen\nt planning and referral to training and employment services. \n2.6.\n \n              \nInterest in Mutual Exchanges has increased and good progress is being made in \n              \npartnership with Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) to develop a Housing Options \n              \nshop which is scheduled to be op\nerational during October 2013. The focus will be on \n              \nsupporting and facilitating exchanges where tenants have expressed and interest in \n              \nthis.\n2.7.\n \n              \nInvest in Renfrewshire is the Council’s flagship programme to tackle unemployment and \n              \nimprove employability wit\nh in Renfrewshire. This programme\n              \n supported a Welfare \n              \nReform training programme within Housing Services for young people between the \n              \nages of 16 and 25. The programme funded the recruitment and supported the training \n              \nof a team of unemployed to support t\nhe initial phases of the contact with tenants \n              \naffected by the under occupancy reduction, a second programme is currently underway \n              \nwith the team focusing on a wider group of council tenants and their households.  The \n              \nfirst programme resulted in all but o\nne of the young participants progressing to \n              \nemployment or further education.\n2.8.\n \n              \nHousing options advice has been extended to include employment sign posting and \n              \nrelevant housing staff have been trained and plans are being progressed to deploy an \n              \nemployment\n adviser dedicated to support unemployed tenants.  \n3.1.\n \n              \nBoth local authority and RSL housing stock is in significant demand as evidenced by \n              \nthe waiting lists, owner occupation is very diffi\ncult to access at present due to high \n              \npurchase prices, the requirement for large deposits and the lack of availability of \n              \nmortgage finance. The Council is already aware that tenants impacted are Housing \n              \nBenefit claimants and this is unlikely to be an op\ntion available to them. \n3.2.\n \n              \nIn Renfrewshire a Housing Options approach is in place; as part of housing advice \n              \nservices, tenants and applicants are given an overview of all housing options available \n              \nto them, including discussions around alternative tenures including the private rented \n              \nsector.\n3.3.\n \n              \nThe private rented sector is relatively smaller compared to other tenures and wider \n              \nwelfare reforms will also make this sector more difficult to access. Tenan\nts leaving their \n              \ncurrent homes may end up staying with family or friends or present as homeless putting \n              \ngreater pressure on existing services.\n3.4.\n \n              \nShelter Scotland, have indicated that people judged to be under-occupying in the social \n              \nsector and who can't \nafford the shortfall, will be forced with the choice to downsize or \n              \nrun up arrears. Due to the widely recognised chronic shortage of one-bedroom social \n              \nhouses, the charity says many will have to turn to the private rented sector. In \n              \nRenfrewshire the exi\nstence of the required number of one bed room private rented \n              \nproperties is questionable.\n3.5.\n \n              \nAs highlighted in tables 1 and 2 in Appendix \n1\n, rent for a one-bedroom property in the \n              \nprivate sector is on average higher than rent for a two-bedroom social proper\nty. \n              \nTenants electing to transition to a private tenancy as means to alleviate the impact of \n              \nunder occupancy rules on a social tenancy, would qualify for full Local Housing \n              \nAllowance (LHA) as they would no longer be assessed as under-occupying – \n              \npervers\nely this would be costing the public purse more in terms of providing housing \n              \ncosts support than it would to provide full benefit support for a social rented property \n              \nwithout any associated under occupancy reduction.\nUnder occupancy reduction4.1.\n \n              \nThe removal of the spare room subsidy, or the bedroom tax, as it is more commonly \n              \nknown, has introduced deductions from housing benefit on tenants who are deemed to \n              \nhave more bedrooms than they need. As referred to ea\nrlier, options for tenants in \n              \nthis situation are limited as the housing stock in the area does not match the associated \n              \ndemand for smaller one bedroom properties and with many affected tenants advising \n              \nthe Council that they  have no way of making up the\n shortfall. \n4.2.\n \n              \nAt the point of implementation of the under occupancy reduction, a total of 1,960 \n              \nCouncil tenants lost £1.2 million a year in housing benefit (as detailed in table 3, \n              \nAppendix 1\n) and 1,100 Housing Association tenants lost £0.6 million a yea\nr in housing \n              \nbenefit. It is anticipated that a major component of this loss in benefit will lead to a \n              \nreduction in rental income for both the Council and Registered Social Landlords (RSLs). \n4.3.\n \n              \nBased on data from the end of July 2013, July the number of te\nnants affected by Under \n              \nOccupancy and in arrears has risen to 1,464, with only 27% of households affected \n              \nmaintaining a clear rent account. The increase in rent arrears since the start of the \n              \nfinancial year and introduction of the under occupancy reduct\nion is £229,000. This is \n              \ndespite the proactive attempts of the Council to inform and support tenants through the \n              \nchanges and places significant financial risks on the potential to recover unpaid rent \n              \ngoing forward.\n4.4.\n \n              \nThe 2013/14 HRA Business Plan include\ns an anticipated increase in the level of \n              \n              \nbudgeted bad debt provision from 2.5% to 3.5% (c£400k increase) and 5% (c£600k \n              \nincrease) thereafter. In addition, previously anticipated staffing savings of £300k in \n              \n2015/16 and £200k in 2016/17 have been remov\ned from the HRA Business Plan to \n              \nreflect the anticipation of increasing service pressures to support tenants and address \n              \ngrowing rental arrears. In addition to this, further budgeted resources  of £331,000 per \n              \nannum have also been built in for 2013/14 a\nnd moving forward to provide the \n              \nnecessary staffing resources that are anticipated, as best can be at this point,  to be \n              \nrequired to provide these additional services and manage the additional service \n              \npressures. Any increased costs or reduction in incom\ne for 2014/15 to 2017/18 will be \n              \nbuilt into future Business Plans once increasing certainty is established over the \n              \nemerging impact of the under occupancy reduction and the wider reform agenda. \n4.5.\n \n              \nHousing Benefit paid to tenants in the private rented sect\nor is based on Local Housing \n              \nAllowance (LHA) rates. The LHA rates in Renfrewshire are higher for all property sizes \n              \nthan in the social rented sector. As referred to above, it is anticipated that a counter-\n              \nproductive consequence of the under occupancy ru\nles will see some  tenants under \n              \noccupying in the social sector, electing  to move to the private sector and receive an \n              \nincreased amount of housing benefit for a smaller sized property. \n4.6.\n \n              \nRenfrewshire Council also expects a number of possible impacts on \nhomelessness \n              \ngenerally which are anticipated to emerge as a direct result of the HB changes. These \n              \ninclude pressure on the proportion of lets to homeless applicants due to an increase in \n              \ntransfer requests from existing tenants in receipt of housing bene\nfit who are under-\n              \noccupying their homes - this may in turn lead to an increase in the length of time taken \n              \nto complete the local authorities duty to house those who are unintentionally homeless, \n              \nand an increase in the need to provide (and fund) temporar\ny accommodation – it should \n              \nbe noted that even those who are deemed to be intentionally homeless can require to \n              \nbe provided with temporary accommodation.\n4.7.\n \n              \nRenfrewshire Council has always recognised the housing circumstances of Council \n              \ntenants and tenant\ns seeking to transfer are given a proportion of available lets within \n              \nthe current allocation policy. \nThe Council is continuing to take a flexible approach in \n              \nconsideration of mutual exchange applications to accommodate those tenants impacted \n              \nby the unde\nr-\n              \noccupancy rules.\nBenefit cap4.8.\n \n              \nWhile numbers affected by the benefit cap within Renfrewshire are low (29), for the \n              \naffected larger families this poses significant concern. The annual reduction in housing \n              \nbenefit paid to these households is currently estimated as £106,384. Input from DWP \n              \nand other agencies, including the Council will be required to provide support to the \n              \nfamilies in relation to employability and housing options.\nSupport and Exempt accommodation4.9.\n \n              \nDiscussions have commenced with the Council’s commissioned housing support \n              \nproviders to look at current service specifications; current housing support provision; \n              \ncurrent housing management provision to determine what changes need to be \n              \nconsider\ned when developing new tenders for these commissioned services.  In the \n              \nfuture housing support and housing management must be much more clearly aligned \n              \nwithin service contracts to ensure supported accommodation projects are sustainable. \n              \nWhile the DWP ha\ns indicated that they wish to better understand the supported housing \n              \nsector and the impact of housing benefit in the sector in order to protect existing \n              \nprovision from the unintended consequences of welfare reform, until this work is \n              \nconcluded risks re\nmain in relation to supported housing provision.\nTemporary Accommodation4.10.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUnder occupancy restrictions are being placed on HB recipients placed in Council \n              \nowned temporary accommodation. This is not the case where tenants are placed in \n              \nprivately sourced/le\nased accommodation used for this purpose. In Renfrewshire 88% or \n              \n147 out of 167 properties used to house people presenting as homeless are council \n              \nowned therefore this potentially places an additional burden. The majority of \n              \nhouseholds living in tempora\nry accommodation receive housing benefit and are placed \n              \nin accommodation arising from an urgent need rather than a strict adherence to size \n              \ncriteria. By the end of July 2013 arrears of approximately £27,000 of under occupancy \n              \narrears had accumulated.\n4.11.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRe\nnfrewshire Council recognises its duty to minimise homelessness and protect the \n              \nvulnerable. In the short term, the impact of the HB reduction will in effect create a \n              \nbenefit gap which is not being passed on to homeless people temporarily lodged in \n              \naccom\nmodation. This is a new burden and a form of cost shunting from the DWP to \n              \nlocal authorities which has the direct impact of diverting already stretched Council \n              \nresources away from other priority areas in order for the Council to protect the most \n              \nvulnera\nble of clients from what is seen as an unintended consequence of welfare \n              \nchanges. However, it is recognised that this action taken by the Council will not be \n              \nsustainable in the long term and addressing this unintended and unfair consequence of \n              \nthe refor\nms on the most vulnerable of individuals is something which the Council \n              \ncontinues to lobby the DWP for through a range of routes.\n4.12.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn addition, it is intended that housing costs for short stay tenants will be included in \n              \nUniversal Credit at LHA rates and \npaid direct to tenants. There will also be a \n              \nmanagement element, or overhead, however the method to be applied has yet to be \n              \ndetermined. The Council has significant concerns over the underlying logic of this \n              \napproach which is expected to place significa\nnt pressure on already extremely \n              \nvulnerable clients and it is fully anticipated that a very high level of non payment of \n              \nassociated rent will occur as a consequence. An estimated non-recovery of £482,000 in \n              \nannual rental income relating to the direct pa\nyment of the Housing Benefit element to \n              \nshort stay tenants through Universal Credit is expected to have an impact on the \n              \nCouncil’s ability to provide Short Stay, temporary accommodation.\n4.13.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWork is ongoing to look at the current modelling of temporary and supported \n              \naccommodation to determine the future viability of the current model of service delivery, \n              \nwhich at present proves to be highly effective at meeting the immediate needs of \n              \nvulner\nable individuals and families. The Council is also looking at developing other \n              \noptions within the private sector to ensure single households have sustainable and \n              \naffordable temporary housing options in accommodation that is the correct size and \n              \nmeets th\neir needs. The Council is currently carrying out scoping exercises of empty \n              \nbuildings and cost analysis on buildings that could potentially meet the Council’s \n              \nrequirements moving forward. However, it is recognised that such potential re-\n              \nmodelling of ser\nvice delivery comes with the risk that what is subsequently put in place \n              \nfails to deliver an equivalent level of service, impacting once again on some of the most \n              \nvulnerable in our society.\nLHA changes 4.14.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDuring 2012/13 the Council supplemented the DHP fun\nd by giving a total of £168,000 \n              \nand over the last year Renfrewshire Council actively supported private sector tenants \n              \nimpacted by the LHA changes. Tenants were contacted and invited to apply for a \n              \nDiscretionary Housing Payment as a means of providing sh\nort term support to allow \n              \nthem time to consider their options or seek alternative accommodation. Overall \n              \n£104,000 was awarded to tenants in private rented accommodation with £26,000 of this \n              \narising from the direct contact made by council staff to tenant\ns affected by the LHA \n              \nchanges. The Council continues to support these customers however with the scale of \n              \nthe changes for social sector tenants the DHP fund is expected to be under significant \n              \npressure as the year progresses therefore it is anticipated \nthat there will be less scope \n              \nto provide a similar level of assistance to affected tenants.\nChanges to non dependant deductions4.15.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Council recognises that non dependent adults living in a property are expected to \n              \nmake a contribution to housing costs, ba\nsed on income. The increase in non dependant \n              \ndeductions over the last two years places additional pressures on landlords in collecting \n              \nthe balance due from non dependants and with the introduction of the under occupancy \n              \nmeans that the presence of a non \ndependant can lead to the need for detailed benefit \n              \nadvice. Households with non dependants have been beneficiaries of DHP payments \n              \nover the last year.\n5.1.\n \n              \nDiscretionary Housing Payments (DHP) provide claimants with additional \nfinancial \n              \nassistance with housing costs, in addition to any welfare benefits, where a local \n              \nauthority considers that further help is required. The DWP allocate the fund to councils \n              \nand councils can, under the legislation, consider adding to this fund up\n to a maximum of \n              \n2.5 times the DWP allocation. In short to medium term a DHP award is likely to be one \n              \nof a limited number of options open to support tenants.  \n5.2.\n \n              \nThe UK Government increased the overall DHP fund to help mitigate some of the short \n              \nto medi\num term impact of the Housing Benefit changes. The Renfrewshire allocation \n              \nhas increased from £74,464 in 2012/13 to £267,351 in 2013/14. The DWP has advised \n              \nthat this increased level of discretionary funding is to be targeted at mitigating the \n              \nimpact of\n the under occupancy reduction, the benefit cap and the impact on temporary \n              \naccommodation after the introduction of Universal Credit. \n5.3.\n \n              \nIn the last two financial years the Council has approved additional top up DHP funding \n              \nof £60,000 in each year. The UK\n Government allocations were £52,314 in 2011/12 and \n              \n£74,464 for 2012/13. \n5.4.\n \n              \nIn addition to the DWP allocation for 2013/14 of £267,351 the Council has approved \n              \nadditional top up support for the DHP fund by £150,000 (150% of previous year) from \n              \nits own res\nources bringing the total support available to £417,351 to provide tenants \n              \nwith short term support that will allow them to meet their rent obligations while \n              \nconsidering other options. While the Council took this necessary step it is recognised \n              \nthat this\n will not address the loss of benefit of £1.8 million across all housing providers \n              \nin relation to the under occupancy alone. There is a proposal going to the Co\nuncil \n              \nmeeting on 3\n October 2013 to bring the Council’s contribution up to the maximum \n              \nallowab\nle.\n5.5.\n \n              \nData on DHP awards since April 2013 highlight that 85% of the awards are being made \n              \nto tenants affected by the under occupancy reduction, with households unable to move \n              \nfor health reasons and families where an extra room is required for access to ch\nildren \n              \nbenefiting most.\n6.1.\n \n              \nRenfrewshire Council would like to take the opportunity to draw the Work and Pensions \n              \nCommittee’s attention to another significantly concerning aspect of the UK Governmen\nt \n              \nwelfare changes linked to the introduction of Universal Credit – direct payments. The \n              \nCouncil view this proposal as the biggest single financial risk to the long term \n              \nsustainability of housing services within Renfrewshire. It breaks the existing \n              \narra\nngement of housing benefit support being paid direct to the landlord and places \n              \nresponsibility on individual tenants to manage their overall finances and sustain on an \n              \nongoing basis payment of their rent. It is the Council’s view that although many tenan\nts \n              \nwill, with appropriate support from the Council, transition to this new arrangement, a \n              \nlarge number will struggle which will inevitably lead to a significant increase in rent \n              \narrears, placing increased financial pressures on social landlords and long\ner term rental \n              \nlevels. \n6.2.\n \n              \nEmerging findings from the DWP Demonstration projects highlights the increase in the \n              \nlevel of non payment of rent and where rental income is being recovered, this is at a \n              \nsignificant cost to the social landlords involved – a cos\nt that DWP do not at this stage \n              \nappear willing to support. Given the limitations of the demonstration projects concerns \n              \nremain over the long term impact of direct payment and the cost of supporting tenants \n              \nto make payment and the impact on household inc\nomes and social landlord revenue \n              \nstreams where conflicts arise. Using Council data, if 10% of tenants do not pay rent the \n              \nloss of rent income per year will amount to £2.6 million a year and this loss rises to £5.2 \n              \nmillion if non payment rises to 20%. \n6.3.\n \n              \nProjected losses in rental income of this order will cause significant challenges in \n              \nrelation to the funding of maintenance programmes and long term investment in \n              \nhousing provision. The Council and social landlords in general will be required to review \n              \nthe affordability of existing funding streams and consider the impact on rent levels for all \n              \ntenants as a consequence of the significant financial pressures that are anticipated.\n7.1.\n \n              \nResponsibility and funding for CT support transferred t\no the Scottish Government and \n              \nthe Council tax Reduction scheme developed in Scotland broadly mirrors the previous \n              \nCouncil Tax Benefit scheme. As the scheme transferred to the Scottish Government \n              \nless 10% of the funding, the Scottish Government and COSLA\n agreed to fund the \n              \ndifference for 2013/14. This transitional arrangement means that recipients of the new \n              \nCouncil Tax Reduction have not seen any change in the level of support they receive. \n              \nDiscussions are being progressed between Scottish Ministers a\nnd COSLA in relation \n              \nthe longer term funding and the impact of funding decisions on the shape and operation \n              \nof the scheme.\n8.1.\n \n              \nRenfrewshire Council has develo\nped and implemented a wide ranging corporate wide \n              \nprogramme of work to ensure the Council is effectively mobilised and plans to manage \n              \nas far as possible the impact of the welfare reform changes. \n8.2.\n \n              \nProgramme activities through 2012/13 have focused on rai\nsing awareness of the \n              \nchanges and engaging directly with those affected, in particular with tenants. A \n              \ncorporate training programme has been developed and delivered to staff and \n              \ncommunications tools such as video and a range of print materials have been\n \n              \ndeveloped and shared with partner organisations across Renfrewshire. The Council \n              \nand partner RSLs have engaged directly with tenants with 85% (1662) of council \n              \ntenants receiving direct contact prior to 1 April 2013. \n8.3.\n \n              \nTo further recognise the needs of \ntenants, Renfrewshire Council has approved \n              \nproposals to reclassify a property where it can be evidenced that a bedroom is stated \n              \nas being required to meet disability or medical needs, and no other suitable alternative \n              \nis available and amendments to the \nallocations policy to enhance exchange options.\n8.4.\n \n              \nIn addition to supplementing the DHP\n funding outlined at paragraph 5\n.4 the Council has \n              \napproved £1.3 million in additional resources for 2013/14 to support tenants and \n              \ncitizens affected by the welfare changes, including the Housing Benefit changes. This \n              \nhas resulted in the deployment of a 45 strong team across a range of services, \n              \nincluding Housing Services, Advice Services and the Benefits Service to provide help \n              \nand\n support.\n8.5.\n \n              \nWelfare reform represents a major financial risk to the Council Housing Revenue \n              \naccount (HRA) over the medium term as a range of welfare changes take effect over \n              \nthis period. The Council has planned for and responded to predicted increases in \n              \ncustomer demands, needs and also to pro-actively protect the financial position of the \n              \nHRA. Resources involved in rent collection have increased as part of proactive \n              \nmeasures outlined earlier. Twelve temporary posts were funded by the Housing \n              \nRevenue A\nccount at a cost of £0.080 million in 2012/13 with a full year recurring cost of \n              \n£0.331 million moving into 2013/14 to supplement existing resources in Housing \n              \nServices. The underlying objective of this investment is to both, support the tenants and \n              \nthe\nir families manage the change but also to seek to pro-actively protect the HRA rental \n              \nstream during this transition. \n8.6.\n \n              \nThe Council’s Benefit Service is proactively managing requests for review and disputes \n              \nin relation to application of the under occupanc\ny reduction in accordance with the \n              \nHousing Benefit legislation and guidance. When additional information is provided by \n              \nthe customer that supports removal of the reduction, the housing benefit decision is \n              \nrevised. Where the decision upheld, a submission\n is prepared and submitted to HM \n              \nCourts and Tribunal Service for consideration.\n8.7.\n \n              \nA welfare reform summit was held in Renfrewshire in December targeting support and \n              \nawareness at Third sector organisations operating in Renfrewshire and the Council has \n              \nrec\nently supported a Third Sector Welfare Reform event led by the Third sector \n              \ninterface organisation in Renfrewshire. Further events are planned. \n8.8.\n \n              \nAn Employability Conference was held in June 2013 targeting employability and \n              \nbusiness development practitio\nners from across Renfrewshire. Information on Welfare \n              \nReform was shared and the discussions will shape future direction and partnership \n              \nworking.\n9.1.\n \n              \nRenfrewshire Council is willing to present oral evidence to the Work and Pensions \n              \nCommittee\n in relation to this inquiry into the provision of support to meet housing cost in \n              \nthe reformed welfare system.\n&#xa0;The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD), the Scottish Government’s official tool for identifying those places in Scotland suffering from deprivation, published in 2012 notes that Renfrewshire’s overall share of the number of datazones showing th\ne worst deprivation in Scotland has increased and the single overall most deprived datazone in Scotland is located in Ferguslie, Paisley. \nIn SIMD 2012, 14.7% of Renfrewshire’s population (25,030 people) is income deprived, compared to a Scotland average o\nf 13.4%. In terms of employment deprivation, 15% of working age Renfrewshire residents (16,070) are employment deprived, compared to 12.8% in Scotland as a whole. Between SIMD 2009 and SIMD 2012, Renfrewshire had the largest increase in the percentage of w\norking age people who are employment deprived (2.4%). Renfrewshire has the 7th largest share in terms of the 15% most deprived areas in Scotland.\nThere are approximately 75,000 households in Renfrewshire. 34% of Renfrewshire households rent their home in t\nhe social rented sector. Renfrewshire Council is a social landlord and retains 12,540 council houses with 68% of the households receiving Housing Benefit to assist them with meeting their housing costs. There are also approximately 7200 social rented prope\nrties managed by Registered Social landlords in the Renfrewshire area, with 69% receiving Housing Benefit.\nThe number of households renting in the private rented sector in Renfrewshire is estimated at 8,200. Of these around 3,400 receive Housing Benefit (L\nHA).\n17,311 households in Renfrewshire were in receipt of Housing Benefit, totalling £63.8 Million as at 31 March 2013. Of this, £28.5 million was paid to Council tenants and £35.3 million was paid to tenants of Registered Social Landlords and private land\nlords.\n1,960 council tenants are affected by the under occupancy reduction. A total of 1,657 tenants under occupy by one bedroom, while 284 under occupy by two bedrooms and 19 under occupy by 3 bedrooms. The total income at risk of non payment at this time\n is £13,500 per week, or £700,000 per annum. \nRenfrewshire – data•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n12540 properties (excluding void properties)\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n68% of tenants receive Housing Benefit \n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n33% of the stock, 4111, are one bed room properties\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n49% of the \nstock, 6098, are two bedroom properties\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n17% of the stock, 2110,  are 3 bed room properties\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n2% of the stock, 220, are 4 or more bed room  properties\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n1286 properties became void during 2012/13 \nTable 1, Renfrewshire Council rent levels 2012/13Size/propertyHouseOwn Door FlatMaisonnetteFlatMulti storey0 bed £     61.54 \n £               60.11 \n £            58.68 \n £     56.53 \n £                  55.82 \n1 bed £     68.70 \n £               67.27 \n £            65.84 \n £     63.69 \n £                  62.97 \n2 bed £     76.57 \n £               75.14 \n £            73.71 \n £     71.56 \n £                  70.85 \n3 bed £     83.73 \n £               82.20 \n £            80.86 \n £     78.72 \n £                  78.00 \n4+ bed £     89.45 \n £               88.02 \n £            86.59 \n £     84.44 \n £                  83.73 \n&#xa0;Table 2, Local Housing Allowance rates March 2013category\nMar-13\nA 1 shared room\n £    65.00 \nB 1 bed room\n £    80.77 \nC 2 bed rooms\n £  102.69 \nD 3\n bed rooms\n £  123.46 \nE 4 bed rooms\n £  184.38 \nTable 3, Impact on Council tenants at differing levels of under occupancyLevel of Under Occupancy\nNo. of affected tenants\nLoss of Housing Benefit (weekly)\nLoss of Housing Benefit (annual)\n1 bed\n1,657\n£17,400\n£903,000\n2 bed\n284\n£5,700\n£294,000\n3 bed\n19\n£400\n£21,000\nTotal\n1,960\n£23,500\n£1,218,000\n&#xa0;&#xa0;25 September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPage \n10\n of \n10\n&#xa0;\n"
