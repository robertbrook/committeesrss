default I can only offer my experience of NHS Complaints.
defaultUsing your guidance: 
default1) defaultHow departments record and provide defaultinfodefaultrmation on complaints receiveddefault?
defaultInformation is collected
default,
default reviewed and then either refused or sent to “reconsideration” for a few months ….then often refused! 
defaultI believe the system is set up to fail complainants and the term “local resolution” is more often a
default request to “escalate to PHSO “if not happy”
default 
default but 
defaultreferral to PHSO 
defaultneeds more than “if not happy”  as I know to my cost!
defaultI realise you don’t investigate individual complaints and my experience of PHSO process is what I need to convey:
defaulta) there was no investigation as “not enough records” 
default(isn’t that a reason to investigate?)
defaultb) A case worker left during assessing my case and left a note on file of “unremedied Injustice” This has been routinely ignored.
defaultc) Recent access to email conversations from SHA SUI Investigation Manager clearly shows the Investigation manager lied re my “alleged agreement ” on the Terms of Reference for the SUI Investigation into my sons death in hospital. This investigation was offered 6 years later and at no time was the PHSO office seeking my advice on anything! 
defaultd) Dame Julie Mellor asked me to a meeting with her to discuss Baroness Fritchies Report.

default I agreed and was advised that restrictions would be placed on the meeting re what we could discuss. I was told 
defaultI couldn’t discuss any
defaultthing re my sons experience (which is why I am still here) and 
defaultI refused to attend. 
defaultI wonder how many others defaultare defaultclosed down too.defaulte) I wrote to PHSO on November 17
defaultth
default 2012 to state why I needed to retain my democratic right to question policy and process and since then one reply dated 14
defaultth
default February 2013 telling me “we will not be revisiting this decision and theres nothing more I can add” I ‘m sorry but the case remains closed. 
defaultI wonder how many others told this too?  defaultHow effectively complaints handlindefaultg is lead within governmentdefault?defaultI refer you to the Health Select Committee Report which states “NHS Complaints system is not working”
default Still! 
defaultOne point is it costs in the region of £32m per year for the PHSO process but less than 2% of complaints are investigated. Is this because PHSO is working on other areas eg as with Equitable Life?
defaultHow complaints are being used to drive innovation and service improvementdefault?defaultIn my opinion 
defaultand from 8 years experience in NHS Complaints, Complaints are not being used to drive innovation and service improvement.. There is a woeful lack of integrity and many are taking full advantage of the fact complaints are seen in such a poor light.
