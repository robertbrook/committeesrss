[normal]Written evidence [bold]submitted by[bold] Dee Speers [bold]([bold]PH25[bold])[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The second inquiry, entitled, Parliament’s Ombudsman service, will look at the work of the Ombudsman 
[normal]I have noted the PASC may be looking at 
[normal]p
[normal]articular issues 
[normal]which 
[normal]may include
[normal]:
[normal]Bearing in mind the findings of the Health Select Committee two years ago which reported 
[normal]http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/health-committee/news/11-06-28-clreoprt-substantive-/
[normal] I can only offer my experience of NHS Complaints.
[normal]Using your guidance: 
[normal]1) [bold]How departments record and provide [bold]info[bold]rmation on complaints received[bold]?
[normal]Information is collected
[normal],
[normal] reviewed and then either refused or sent to “reconsideration” for a few months ….then often refused! 
[normal]I believe the system is set up to fail complainants and the term “local resolution” is more often a
[normal] request to “escalate to PHSO “if not happy”
[normal] 
[normal] but 
[normal]referral to PHSO 
[normal]needs more than “if not happy”  as I know to my cost!
[normal]I realise you don’t investigate individual complaints and my experience of PHSO process is what I need to convey:
[normal]a) there was no investigation as “not enough records” 
[normal](isn’t that a reason to investigate?)
[normal]b) A case worker left during assessing my case and left a note on file of “unremedied Injustice” This has been routinely ignored.
[normal]c) Recent access to email conversations from SHA SUI Investigation Manager clearly shows the Investigation manager lied re my “alleged agreement ” on the Terms of Reference for the SUI Investigation into my sons death in hospital. This investigation was offered 6 years later and at no time was the PHSO office seeking my advice on anything! 
[normal]d) Dame Julie Mellor asked me to a meeting with her to discuss Baroness Fritchies Report.

[normal] I agreed and was advised that restrictions would be placed on the meeting re what we could discuss. I was told 
[normal]I couldn’t discuss any
[normal]thing re my sons experience (which is why I am still here) and 
[normal]I refused to attend. 
[normal]I wonder how many others [bold]are [bold]closed down too.[bold]e) I wrote to PHSO on November 17
[normal]th
[normal] 2012 to state why I needed to retain my democratic right to question policy and process and since then one reply dated 14
[normal]th
[normal] February 2013 telling me “we will not be revisiting this decision and theres nothing more I can add” I ‘m sorry but the case remains closed. 
[normal]I wonder how many others told this too?  [bold]How effectively complaints handlin[bold]g is lead within government[bold]?[bold]I refer you to the Health Select Committee Report which states “NHS Complaints system is not working”
[normal] Still! 
[normal]One point is it costs in the region of £32m per year for the PHSO process but less than 2% of complaints are investigated. Is this because PHSO is working on other areas eg as with Equitable Life?
[normal]How complaints are being used to drive innovation and service improvement[bold]?[bold]In my opinion 
[normal]and from 8 years experience in NHS Complaints, Complaints are not being used to drive innovation and service improvement.. There is a woeful lack of integrity and many are taking full advantage of the fact complaints are seen in such a poor light.
