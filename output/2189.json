For example, in Sweden the self-employed are only covered in relation to chemicals and machinery to protect their safety and that of those who may be affected by their work, whilst in Germany the law does not apply to the self-employed except where their work may affect the safety of employees.”\n&#xa0;\nHe goes on to argue:\n&#xa0;\n“\nThere is a case for following a similar approach to other countries and exempting from health and safety law those self-employed people (i.e. those who do not have any employees) whose workplace activities pose no potential risk of harm to others. \n&#xa0;\nThis would benefit approximately 1 million people. The actual burden that the regulations currently place upon these self-employed may not be particularly significant due to existing exceptions in some regulations\n \nand the limited prospect of these being enforced but it will help reduce the perception that health and safety law is inappropriately applied. This will complement HSE’s recently revised guidance for employers on \nhomeworkers\n”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Clause 2 - Removal of employment tribunal’s power to make wider recommendations&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nClause 3 - English apprenticeships: simplification&#xa0;&#xa0;\nIndependent Richard R\neview\n of Apprenticeships\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSpecifics of this Bill\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nEmployment law and Apprenticeships\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nClauses 50-57 -  Legislation no longer of practical use &#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nClauses 58-61 -  Exercise of regulatory functions &#xa0;\nThese clauses refer to the ‘growth duty’. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n16 September 2013\n1\n | \nPage\n&#xa0;\n"
