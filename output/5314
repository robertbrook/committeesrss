[normal]              
[normal]The Understanding Walking and C
[normal]ycling (UWAC) project examined the factors influencing everyday transport decisions in four English towns/cities (Leeds, Leicest
[normal]er, Worcester, Lancaster) and investigated why people do not choose to walk and cycle. While some of the conclusions drawn are purely sociological. i.e. it is not ‘normal’ there is a clear perception that cycling is dangerous and that only the most committ
[normal]ed cyclists are happy to mix with other traffic.

[normal]Therefore, the question of whether cycling is safe is largely irrelevant as it is currently not perceived to be safe. It is only when these safety perceptions are changed that mass cycling in the UK will
[normal] be the norm.

[normal]Rather than relist the evidence presented in many other submissions, it is more succinct to say we second the recommendations made by the CTC in their written evidence (CYS 053).

[normal]Finally, it is clear that we know how to solve the safe
[normal]ty issues, what is required is political will and sustained high investment.
