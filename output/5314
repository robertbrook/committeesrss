defaultThe Understanding Walking and C
defaultycling (UWAC) project examined the factors influencing everyday transport decisions in four English towns/cities (Leeds, Leicest
defaulter, Worcester, Lancaster) and investigated why people do not choose to walk and cycle. While some of the conclusions drawn are purely sociological. i.e. it is not ‘normal’ there is a clear perception that cycling is dangerous and that only the most committ
defaulted cyclists are happy to mix with other traffic.

defaultTherefore, the question of whether cycling is safe is largely irrelevant as it is currently not perceived to be safe. It is only when these safety perceptions are changed that mass cycling in the UK will
default be the norm.
