default&#xa0;
defaultSummarydefault1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultApproximately 15% of the global population live with some form of impairment
default. People with disabilities, and children in particular, 
defaultface an array of challenges. They are disproportionally likely to live in poverty and experience 
defaulthigher
default rates of violence and abuse. Often stigmatised by their communities, they are denied access to v
defaultital services such as an education and healthcare. 
default&#xa0;
default2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBy neglecting to include children with impairments in the development process, 
defaulttheir risk of vulnerability increases
default. 
defaultTherefore, to lift individual
defaults
default and 
defaultcommunities out of poverty, it is essential to inc
defaultlude adults and children with disabilities in development interventions. Attention must be targeted towards breaking down the social barriers experienced by individuals and equip them 
defaultwith tools 
defaultto 
defaultbe able to 
defaultactively participate in their own development. 
default&#xa0;
default3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK Department for International Development had once made disability-inclusive programming a key priority
default. However, it has slipped down the agenda. For instance, l
defaultack of disaggregated data on DFID programmes makes it 
defaulthard 
defaultto see if the department is truly having an impact on the lives of those with disabilities, or are even including them in 
defaultprojects. 
default&#xa0;
default4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe welcome the recent highlighting of disability issues by DFID, and Lynne Featherstone MP in particular. This must turn i
defaultnto practical action, inc

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUNICEF estimates for every 1 child that is k
defaultilled as a consequence of armed violence, 3 children are left with permanent, life-long injuries or disabilities
default. Therefore, in fragile contexts 
defaultefforts must be made to ensure children and adults with disabilities are not ‘forgotten victims’
default in the event of natural disasters or conflicts but instead are considered and included in all preparedness and recovery plans.

defaultC
defaulthildren 
defaultand adults 
defaultwith disabilities are 
defaultoften 
defaultamong the most vulnerable people in the communities 
defaultin which we work
default. 
defaultIn World Vision’s latest 
defaultresearch on Most Vulnerable Children programming, both child and adult respondents identified children with disabilities (CWDs) among groups of most vulnerable children
default. 
defaultThe
defaultre are a range of causes of vulnerability including:
default poverty, lack of opportunitie
defaults, deprivation of rights, serious stigma and discrimination, inaccessibility to facilities and services
default such as education and healthcare
default, lack of self-confidence
default. 
default&#xa0;
default7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChildren with disabilities are also more vulnerable to abusive relationships
default. For example
default in Kenya
default 
defaultit was estimated that 15-20% of CWDs experience 
defaultgrave 
defaultlevels of physical and sexual violence
default.
default 
defaultN
defaultatural disasters 
defaultand conflicts 
defaultcan also increase the vulnerability 
defaultwhere
default, for example,
default physical impairments may cause individuals to be less mobile. 
defaultThe UN committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has described individuals with disabilities currently living and fleeing Syria were the ‘forgotten victims’ of the conflict
default. They have become extremely vulnerable and face grave violations of the
defaultir rights as they struggle to access essential services. 
defaultEmergency response programmes aren’t always well catered for people with disabilities (PWDs)
default either
default. 
default&#xa0;

defaulteduc
defaulting
default under-five mortality rates to less than 20 percent, experts believe the figure for children with disabilities could 
defaultactually 
defaultbe as high as 80 percent mortality
default.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultO
defaultn
defaulte of the major criticisms of 
defaultthe Millennium Development Goals 
default(MDGs) 
defaultset out by the United Nations remains to be the
default absence of a 
defaultfocus on disability
default.
default 
defaultIt could be argued that t
defaulthe lack of 
defaultinclusion of
default 
defaultC
defaultWDs in development programming caused one of the prominent barriers to achieving the MDGs.
default For example, in the 2007 UNESCO Education for All Global Monitoring Report, it was estimated that one third of the 77 million children missi
defaultng out on education were disabled
default and in Africa, fewer than 10% of disabled children attended school
default. It has become clear that if we 
defaultwere to achieve MDG2
default -
default u
defaultniversal primary education
default -
default there would have to be a deliberate focus on mak
defaulting education 
defaultaccessible to all
default,
default and ensuring the inclusion of disabled children would be an integral part of that.
default With
default 57 million children still out of school in 2013
default achieving MDG2 seems unlikely. 
default&#xa0;
default10.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs we approach the 2015 deadline, 
defaultconversations have 
defaultnow 
defaultbegun arou
defaultnd disability in the post-
defaultMDG
default agenda. 
defaultWorld Vision 
defaultparticularly 
defaultcommends Permanent Undersecretary of State for International Development, L
defaultynne Featherstone and DFID in leading in these
default global
default discussions
default.
default World Vision agrees that 
defaultin order to tackle 
defaultpoverty, we must address the needs of the people with disability
default and welcomes the Minister’s commitment to make disability rights a key development priority
default. 
defaultWe believe that to truly bring communities out of poverty
default we must eliminate the social stigma an
defaultd discrimination 
defaultC
defaultWDs experience and ensure that disability inclusion should be mainstreamed in all development interventions.
default 
defaultA particular focus on challenging the social norms and stigmatisation towards CWDs needs t
defaulto be embedded in all interventions and 
defaultDFID should make funding available to make this 
defaultachievable
default.
default 
defaultAs the post-2015 framework is beginning to take shape, we should not see disability-inclusion as a stand-alone goal, but rather a cross-cutting theme relevant to all development issues.
default&#xa0;
defaultChanging defaultattitudes and behaviours towards disabilitiesdefault is vitaldefault&#xa0;
default11.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAccording to the UN Convention on the Rights of 
defaultthe Child
default, 
defaultchildren 
defaultwith disabilities have the right to 
defaulta 
defaultfull
default and decent life
default, 
defaultto 
defaultequally and meaningfully participate in and benefit from humanitarian
default assistance and development processes in their communities
default. However
default,
default the rights of 
defaultthese 
defaultchildren 
defaultmay be violated by attitudinal, institutional or environmental barriers that exist in any given society. Every community or society has barriers that prevent
default some of its members (especially those with physical, sensory or intellectual impairments) from participating in activities that other members of society enjoy. 
default&#xa0;
default12.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWorld Vision works according to the 
defaultsocial model of disability
default. Our approach to disability 
defaultinclusion focuses on the social, programming and rights issues
default.
default World Vision seeks to raise awareness of disability to ensure that disabled people’s human rights are respected, to reduce social stigma, break down barriers and to ensure that disabled people
default are included in and not excluded from their community’s development.  World Vision partners with disabled peoples organisations (DPOs) and other organisations to achieve this aim.
default We recognise that not all with disabilities 
defaultwill 
defaultbe categorised as ‘most vu
defaultlnerable’
default.
default 
defaultH
defaultowever World Vision works on the basis that 
defaultonly 
defaultwhen inclusion with equal access to development opportunities is achieved, 
defaultwill 
defaultmost
default individuals
default with disabilities become 
defaultless 
defaultvulnerable.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultWorld Visiondefault’sdefault approach to disability-mainstreamingdefault: defaultour programmes and projectsdefault&#xa0;
default13.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWorld Vision promotes ‘disability mainstreaming’ ensuring that the 
defaultrights 
defaultof disabled people are met
default and as equally represented
default.
default 
defaultDisability is recognised as relevant for World Vision programmes and projects 
defaultacross all sectors
default 
defaulta
defaultnd is deliberately considered at all stages 
defaultthroughout their assessment, design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. The goal is to enable equal access and opportunities for people with disabilities as programme participants and beneficiaries. 
default&#xa0;
default14.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGiv
defaulten that disabled 
defaultchildren 
defaultare often hidden within population
defaults
default, World Vision proactively seeks to understand the ratio in the population and to ensure that the number of 
defaultindividuals 
defaultwith disabilities participating in World Vision programmes and projects 
defaultwill at least reflect it.
default In World Vision’s long-term area development programmes, we seek to reflect this ratio with the number of CWDs included as sponsored children.
default Although our approach is to include disability issues in all our development programmes
default, we also realise that more targeted (including at 
defaultC
defaultWDs) projects are needed. Inclusive programming alone will not be sufficient to support those who are most vulnerable in the community.
default 
defaultIn this light, we support DFID’s 
default‘twin-track’
default approach to disabilit
defaulty; to promote the deliberate inclusion and 
defaultactive 
defaultparticipation of 
defaultC
defaultWDs in all areas of development whilst not neglecting to also address the particular needs of those individuals.  
default&#xa0;
default15.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn 2006 World Vision UK was awarded a 
defaultfive
default year grant from DFID as a part of their Programme Partnership Agreement (PPA). From 2008, the PPA grant amounted to approximately £2.5million per year, part of which was earmarked to mainstream disability into World Vision’s programming. Our strategic obj
defaultective to ‘strengthen the engagement of disabled people in poverty reduction’ 
defaulttook
default a 
defaultlearning 
defaultapproach to mainstream disability across 
defaultparticular 
defaultWV partners. Priority was given to developing training on disability issues for WV staff (by 2011 it had reach
defaulted over 2,500 staff); piloting projects in selected 
defaultDFID priority 
defaultcountries and learning in areas of service delivery such as 
defaultin 
defaulteducation; development of external partnerships with national disabled peoples organisations (DPOs); and evaluation
default. 
defaultWe consid
defaultered a
defaultll of the
defaultse
default elements essential to successfully mainstreaming disability
default. These are
default now central components of our development programming
default.
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default16.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultI
defaultn 2010 World Vision UK produced a training handbook “
defaultTravelling Together – how to include disabled people on
default the main road of development”
default,
default which as well as
default defaulthighlighting the inequality that disabled people face, provides practical tools to promote inclusion in community development.  This handbook 
defaultis 
defaultwidely used
default, 
defaultraising awareness and promoting the inclusion of
default disabled people in development internationally.
default defaultIn designing a disability-inclusive strategy, DFID must take into account that persons with disabilities are diverse and belong to different gender, age, culture, race and ethnicity, socio-economic background, religion, educational background, and family b
defaultackground. 
defaultResearch by 
defaultthe International Institute for Child Rights and Development (
defaultIICRD
default)
default and World Vision on Most Vulnerable Children has
default also 
defaultdemonstrated that CWD who are included in development programmes, supported and cared for by family, peers and
default community and have access to education and social opportunities are far less vulnerable and able to play an active role in their own development
default. Thus we recommend that DFID funds and supports programming solutions that promote the full inclusion of CWD,
default by removing barriers to access to education, health, protection and other vital services.
default 
defaultChildren 
defaultwith disabilities also have different types and degrees of impairment, and these should be taken into account for mainstreaming disability into DFID’s progr
defaultamming.
default&#xa0;
default17.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA major factor that contributed to the positive progress made in mainstreaming disability throughout the
default 2006-2011 PPA programme
default was training World Vision and its partners’ development workers themselves in a
defaultcknowledg
defaulting the
default right
defaults of disabled 
defaultpeople
default to be included in development programmes
default. 
defaultThis allowed our staff to 
defaultthen educate the community and focus on p
defaultrogrammes and projects 
defaultof
default inclusiveness and accessibility, not on individuals’ condition or impairments.
default defaultWorld Vision’s development programming approach deliberately takes a positive, rights-based approach to disability. We focus on the positive ‘assets’ or ‘capabilities’ of individuals, families and communities and seek to build on these, rather than startin
defaultg with a negative deficits approach. 
defaultWe recommend that DFID provides disability equality orientation and refresher training to key stakeholders including
default DFID staff and leadership. This promotes attitudinal and behavioural changes, accessibility and inclus
defaultive programming, in order to eliminate discrimination against persons with disabilities in DFID’s programmes. Wherever possible, disability training should be provided by, or in cooperation with, community-based or national disabled people’s organisations.
default&#xa0;
default18.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn 2011, World Vision UK was awarded a second PPA grant, with a new focus on child protection. 
defaultO
defaultur goal to ensure ‘children and communities, especially the most vulnerable and those in the poorest and/or most fragile contexts, are cared and protected’ ha
defaults mainstreamed disability into its programmes. Baseline and monitoring data for this PPA outcome is disaggregated by disability, to ensure levels of inclusion are measured
default and reflected upon
default. Mainstreaming disability into child protection programming has a
defaultlso contributed to a change in social norms around 
defaultthe inclusion of certain groups
default in development processes and 
defaulthas 
defaultled to decreased levels of prejudice in the community. What is currently 
defaultmissing
default from DFID reporting is the lack of clear disaggregated data
default on the numbers of PWDs and specifically CWDs in targeted areas, being reached and impacted. We call on DFID to demand clear, disaggregated data from projects they fund. 
defaultIf
default this 
defaultproves logistically challenging, DFID should provide enough funds to ensure th
defaultis standard of data is still provided
default.
default&#xa0;
default19.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultProgress has also been made on both an international and national level in raising awareness of the rights of disabled people and World Vision has seen a rise in opportunities to influence decision-makers on this issue. 
defaultFor example, t
defaulthrough the collaborati
defaultve efforts of World Vision India and WV International’s Global Advocacy Team, Nisha Das, a 15-year-old girl, represented the voices of children and youth at the thematic debate on Inequality at the United Nations (UN) Headquarters in New York on July 8, 20
default13.  The event, titled “The role of the United Nations in promoting a new global human order,” was convened by the President of the UN General Assembly, H.E. Mr. Vuk Jeremić.  Nisha was invited to be the sole representative of the youth and gave a statemen
defaultt during the interactive debate on “Reducing Inequality: Perspectives from Civil Society.”  She is part of World Vision India’s North Kolkata Area Development Program and a leader of the National Forum of Children with Disability in India. World Vision bel
defaultieves that PWDs must be central to any discussions concerning disability and development. Opportunities 
defaultshould be
default made for those who can best represent the rights and views of citizens with disabilities 
defaultranging 
defaultfrom the global level, at the UN to state gov
defaulternments and 
defaultin 
defaultparliament, and at the local level
default,
default in the community.   
default&#xa0;
defaultTargeting disability in fragile states default&#xa0;
default20.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWorld Vision UK focuses on reaching the most vulnerable people 
defaultliving 
defaultin the 
defaultworld’s toughest 
defaultplaces. We deliberately choose to work in fragi
defaultle contexts where communities are often recovering from conflict and in areas where the national government is not fulfilling its responsibilities
default to its citizens.
default Research suggests that children with disabilities experience violence at a greater rate of 
default1.7 annually than able-bodied youths
default. 
defaultUNICEF 
defaultestimate
defaults
default 
defaultfor every 1 child that is killed as a consequence of armed violence, 3 children are left with permanent, life-long injuries or disabilities. Between
default 1990 and 2001, 6 million more had been left disabled
default. 
defaultIn natural disasters and conflicts, the needs of CWDs are often neglected and these individuals become ‘forgotten victims’
default of the emergency
default.
default In these areas, we are aware that impairments may not only
default affect an individual at birth but it may also be the consequence of living in these conditions
default and our programmes reflect this
default. 
default 
default&#xa0;
default21.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWorld Vision’s child friendly spaces (CFS) – a child protection
default and 
defaultnon formal 
defaulteducation
default intervention used to support communities in emergencies – allow staff to identify the most vulnerable
default 
defaultchildren
default, including those with disabilities. 
defaultCFS programmes aim to mainstream t
defaulthe needs of disabled children, 
default(
defaultboth as a predetermined condition or as a 
defaultresult of the crisis
default)
default, which provide the necessary provisions for those groups as well as maintaining activities essential to a child’s development such as access to education and healthcare. 
default&#xa0;
default22.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA 3 year research programme by Columbia University is currentl
defaulty assessing the impact of CFS run by World Vision, Save the Children and UNICEF. Its initial findings have found that the effectiveness of child friendly spaces in a camp for Congolese refugees in western Uganda suggest that children who regularly attend C
defaultFS were able to sustain their psychological well-being, where as those who didn’t attend had a marked deterioration. 
defaultAlmost 50% of children categorised as ‘most vulnerable’ who had scored ‘at risk’ levels of psychological difficulties at the time the basel
defaultine was conducted were regular attendees of CFS. All children showed a reduction in difficulties to normative levels at a follow up assessment
default. 
default&#xa0;
default23.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe recommend that DFID 
defaultreviews
default 
defaultits humanitarian response strategies to ensure its assistance is reaching the most vulnerable groups, including 
defaultbut 
defaultnot exclusively, those with disabilities. 
defaultWhen working in these challenging contexts, DFID must be prepared to provide both physical and psy
defaultchological rehabilitation to 
defaultall 
defaultvictims
default 
defaultof armed violence. In its recovery programming, DFID must be flexible and consider the potential need to adapt beneficiaries’ livelihoods to better suit their new circumstances.   
default&#xa0;defaultConclusiondefault&#xa0;default24.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn 2000, DFID highlig
defaulthted the critical need to address disability issues in response to tackling poverty. However
default in the years since,
default 
defaultwe have seen discussions around disability-inclusive programming often neglected
default and
default replaced by other DFID priorities. 
defaultWe applaud Lynne Feathe
defaultrstone in driving efforts to return DFID’s attention towards this issue
default however more action is required by DFID to ensure assistance is targeted and inclusive of people, particularly children, with disabilities
default. DFID 
defaultshould
default not view disability as a separate agenda for its development programmes but instead
default,
default commit to achieving inclusion of 
defaultdisabled individuals
default,
default 
defaultthose who are excluded or marginalised in the communities DFID and its partners work in
default.default 
default25.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDFID must demand more fro
defaultm its implementing partners in terms of disaggregating available data by disability, age and gender; 
defaultenabling 
defaultfull transparency 
defaultin measuring 
defaultthe inclusion of disabled individuals 
defaultin the programmes and projects it funds. 
defaultFunding must be made available by DF
defaultID to ensure disaggregation of data can happen effectively.
default26.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn DFID programmes there needs to be a strong
default focus on tackling the discrimination 
defaultexperienced by people with disabilities in communities. Interventions should celebrate an individual’s capabilities, not their impairments 
defaultand promote active participation in the community. The more positive attention paid to how an individual can contribu
defaultte to their own development will aid efforts to breakdown social and physical barriers in society. 
defaultParticular attention should be paid to children with disabilities
default, ensuring they have access to education, healthcare and other basic services that will cont
defaultribute towards the creation of supportive networks for the child. In these instances, they will be less vulnerable to abuse and exploitation often experienced by children with disabilities.
default DFID must recognise that the needs of adults with disabilities and
default the needs of children with disabilities can greatly differ.
default27.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn fragile contexts, DFID must 
defaultmake every effort to reach the most vulnerable children
default. In designing disaster risk reduction strategies, the needs of children with impairments must be considered. In emergency response and medical care must be fully accessible to and inclusive of people with disabilities. The Rights of disabled people and th
defaultat of children must be upheld during and in the aftermath of emergencies, in areas such as refugee and 
defaultinternally displaced persons
default camps.
default28.
default&#xa0; 
defaultGlobally
default, 
defaultthe space to advocate on the inclusion of different development issues in 
defaulta
default post-2015 framework is very cro
defaultwded
default and it will prove challenging to keep the pressure on disability to be included as a cross-cutting theme
default. If DFID is truly committed to bringing disability-inclusion to the forefront of development, it needs to ensure this topic 
defaultremains
default central to the
default development discourse.
default The voices of disabled adults and children should be heard and considered at all levels of decision-making. Opportunities should be opened up to bring representatives of these groups into the centre of the post-2015 development deba
defaultte.
