[[[EXECUTIVE SUMMARY]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[INTRODUCTION]]]Voice: the union for education professionals is pleased to have the opportunity to respond to the call for evidence by the Joint Committee on the Draft Deregulation Bill.  Voice is an independent trade union, founded in 1970 by two Essex teachers, Colin Leicester and Ray Bryant, who gathered together a group of like-minded professional teachers who were prepared to commit themselves to the principle of not striking.  The union now has 32,000 members across all sectors of education (early years, primary, secondary and tertiary), including teachers, lecturers, school and college leaders, teaching assistants and other school support staff, nannies, nursery nurses, childcare and early years professionals, centrally employed staff working for Local Authorities in education or children’s services, students on teacher training or childcare courses, and self-employed tutors and consultants.  Formerly known as The Professional Association of Teachers, the union re-branded in February 2008 as Voice: the union for education professionals.  Independent of the Trades Union Congress and not affiliated to any political party, Voice prefers to use the force of argument rather than the argument of force and, as such, relies on the power of effective negotiation rather than resorting to strikes or any other form of industrial action.
