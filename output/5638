defaultExamination of WitnessesdefaultRichard Brooksdefault,

defaultRichard Murphydefault, Director, Tax Research LLP 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ32 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default Good afternoon, Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultMurphy and 
defaultMr
default&#xa0;
defaultBrooks
default, and thank you very much indeed for coming again to be with us today.  I hope you will agree that we can go straight to questions.
defaultRichard Murphy:default Can I just disclose?  I think it is important, because Lord
default&#xa0;
defaultJoffe is a 
defaultm
defaultember of this Committee, that I record that his charitable trust pay
defaults
default me a grant for work on accounting and taxation mainly in 
defaultAfrica
default.
defaultThe Chairman:default Lord
default&#xa0;
defaultJoffe has declared that as well.  Can we start with a very general question?  You have been sitting and listening to 
defaultall
default this and have heard our previous witnesses, so can I just have your views as to the advantages, both commercial and tax, of structuring a business as a partnership rather than as a company?  Apart from the obvious limitation of liability, what additional advantages might LLPs, as distinct from general partnerships, offer their members? 
defaultRichard Murphy:default I am a member of two LLPs, so I have some experience in this area.  The clear advantage for many people with regard to an LLP over a conventional partnership will be the formulised structure, which provide
defaults
default a legal protection, in part, from your other partners, which in a general partnership I would generally rate to be the biggest risk you face, candidly, and something to be avoided at all costs, if possible.  I have never seen bigger consequences of a partnership than people falling out with each other, and that is in my previous role as a professional adviser where I have seen that happen often.  That I would put as number one.  
defaultIt is very important to say that in tax terms a partnership is not as advantageous for most people as a limited company, because we are ignoring the fact that when compared to the vast majority of partnerships—90% of partnerships are small and over half turn
default 
defaultover less than the VAT limit—the vast majority of small companies will pay little or no 
defaultnational insurance
default.  Members will be taking out their rewards by dividends and therefore little or no PAYE and 
defaultnational insurance
default will be paid, whereas the members of a partnership do pay 
defaultc
defaultlass
default&#xa0;
default2 and 
defaultc
defaultlass
default&#xa0;
default4 
defaultnational insurance
default.  So, by and large, the tax liability in smaller partnerships, which are the most common, is higher in a partnership than it is in a company these days, and most people would therefore choose a company over a partnership.  Therefore, a partnership structure is chosen for other reasons.  There are significant administrative advantages to a partnership.  I certainly find those appealing.  The fact that a partner can withdraw funds during the course of the year without paying PAYE on that occasion
default means that 
defaultthere is flexibility.  In that sense, there is flexibility with regard to repayment of capital, because the capital needs of some businesses obviously fluctuate.  There is cash flow.  Tax is paid twice a year on 31
default&#xa0;
defaultJanuary and 31
default&#xa0;
defaultJuly.  That clearly helps some partnerships and it is seen as an advantage.  For very many people it will be a reputation issue; it looks like a professional structure as well.  Personally, I was told by my professional indemnity insurers 
defaultthat 
defaultI had to differentiate my own affairs from being a sole practitioner as a chartered accountant when I was undertaking the sort of work 
defaultthat 
defaultI do for 
defaultTax Research
default, and so it gave me a separate legal i
defaultdentity.  
defaultThe numbers of reasons involved are very high, therefore.  There is no simple answer, and I think Malcolm
default&#xa0;
defaultGammie made that clear as well.  There are some advantages, but we should not ignore the fact that it is not normally, in smaller businesses, tax motivated.
defaultThe Chairman:default In smaller businesses.
defaultRichard Murphy:default In smaller business it is not.  
defaultQ33 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default If we can take the large growth in LLPs and look at the larger businesses
default, 
defaultyou have partly answered this but do you think this growth has been driven mainly by tax considerations or are others even more important? 
defaultRichard Murphy:default If you look at what is happening—and I have been following quite a lot of literature—particularly in the law profession at the moment with regard to reactions to the proposed legislation, you will see a great many articles coming out suggesting that firms are having to review their partnership structures quite radically.  They are quite concerned that a great many junior partners, who would have previously been on PAYE even though supposedly having partnership status, are now members of the LLP with a guaranteed income; that is clearly tax-motivated.  I do not think there is much doubt that in the larger firms there has been a significant tax advantage to the
default use of the LLP structure while
default offering considerable indemnity in a very simple legal form compared to the previous arrangements that existed before LLPs were available for professional firms, where indemnity arrangements had to be put in place for the salaried partners.  This is a much simpler structure.  It is much easier for them to create an LLP and indemnify the so
default&#x2011;
defaultcalled salary of junior partners and get a tax saving at the same time, so there is a very big difference in behaviour amongst the larger partnerships and the smaller ones here.
defaultRichard Brooks:default In terms of the advantages, it is worth going right back to the origins of UK LLPs.  
defaultT
defaulthey were set up really to offer accountants in particular, particularly the big accountancy firms, the best of both worlds.  They wanted the advantages of a partnership.  They talk about the cultural advantages, but really the main one was the tax advantage of being a partner and not a director.  They also wanted to limit their liabilities.  This goes back to the mid
default&#x2011;
default1990s.  There had been a series of accountancy scandals.  They feared that if they were sued they would lose their houses, so the tax and the legal treatment were divorced and what you have seen in recent years with the range of tax avoidance techniques using th
defaultese vehicles is the consequence
default of that.  This is how to screw up the tax system
default: 
defaultstart with a fundamental breakdown of the economic and tax results
default and 
defaultseparate the two in this way.  
defaultThere is a brilliant pamphlet that I have brought along, written by Professor
default&#xa0;
defaultPrem
default&#xa0;
defaultSikka from 
defaultEssex
default&#xa0;
defaultUniversity
default with Austin
default&#xa0;
defaultMitchell and Jim
default&#xa0;
defaultCousins, who you might know, which talks about the origins of LLPs in the 1990s.  The big accountancy firms, led by Price
default W
defaultaterhouse, went to the Jersey Financial Services Commission and said, “We want LLPs”.  They forced legislation through in Jersey
default, and 
defaultthen they came to the UK and said, “If you do not give us LLPs here, we will all disappear to Jersey”, and the Government fell for that—first, the last Conservative Government, then finally the 
defaultn
defaultew Labour Government.  
defaultThis is a way to complicate the tax system.  You create a fundamental change like that without thinking through the consequences at all.  You surrender to those vested interests and you end up with a whole world of tax avoidance opportunity
default,
default and when you try to correct that 15
default&#xa0;
defaultyears on you end up with a hugely complex tax system.  There is a certain irony in the fact that this was all forced through by Price
default W
defaultaterhouse while John
default&#xa0;
defaultWhiting was a partner of Price
default W
defaultaterhouse.  He is now running the Office of Tax Simplification clearing up the mess, so we have really come full circle.  This is an object lesson in how to mess up the tax system.  
defaultRichard Murphy:default Can I just come back on that point?  In fact, it is quite important to note that it was estimated to cost PricewaterhouseCoopers
default—
defaultErnst
default&#xa0;
default&amp;
default&#xa0;
defaultYoung were involved at the time as well
default—
defaultabout £1
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion to create the 
defaultJersey
default legislation.  I recently made an 
defaultinquiry
default in 
defaultJersey
default as to whether the legislation had ever been used there to incorporate an LLP.  It has never been used to create an LLP.  It was a pure exercise in putting pressure on the UK
default&#xa0;
defaultGovernment.
defaultQ34 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Wakeham:default It is very interesting.  You probably heard me ask this of the people before.  When I was in the Government, it was some years before they did it
default. T
defaulthe pressure was about limiting liability, because they were worried, as you rightly said.  When the LLPs were introduced in 2000, there were some who pointed out the avoidance possibilities of the legislation and some of the people who were sitting there said so.  Why do you think the Government of the day went ahead with it anyway without addressing those risks?  
defaultRichard Brooks:default They did what vested interest told them to do.  This is why picking on limited liability partnerships is a really good case study to put next to your wider question about how you develop tax policy.  It is an exemplar of where, if you surrender to what people with deep pockets want, you end up with some terrible consequences.  I have done a lot of research on the use of limited liability partnerships, which goes slightly beyond tax.  You mentioned that people pointed out 
defaultthat 
defaultthere were avoidance opportunities already.  If you go back to the 1980s with limited companies, you had things called nowhere companies, which were not tax-resident in any country for tax purposes.  They were incorporated in the 
defaultUK
default, but they were managed abroad, so you could say 
defaultthat 
defaultunder a 
defaultUK
default test they were not tax
default&#x2011;
defaultresident, and under another country’s test they were not tax resident; they were nowhere.  That is what you created.  By creating a tax transparent system for limited liability partnerships you created that for limited liability partnerships.  That “nowhere” nature, that absence of any location for tax purposes, is what is behind the use of limited liabilities on an absolutely enormous scale for financial crime.  
defaultI did a report for 
defaultPrivate Eye 
defaultcalled “
defaultWhere there’s muck
default,
default there’s brass plates
default”,
default 
defaultwhich looked
default at shell companies
default. 
default 
defaultWe
default found that the corporate vehicle of choice for money launderers now is the limited liability partnership.  To give you an example, if I can, at the mom
defaultent
default there are over 2,100
default&#xa0;
defaultlimited liability partnerships whose members are 
defaultSeychelles
default shell companies.  There are 1,800
default&#xa0;
defaultlimited liability partnerships whose members are 
defaultBelize
default shell companies—two shell companies in each case.  You sort of know who is behind them; they are 
defaulte
defaultastern European criminal networks.  These limited liability partnerships have been behind things like laundering the proceeds of the tax fraud that led to the murder of Sergei
default&#xa0;
defaultMagnitsky.  They have laundered the funds from shipping arms to President
default&#xa0;
defaultAssad.  They have been behind any number of corrupt 
defaultg
defaultovernment contracts in the former 
defaultSoviet
default&#xa0;
defaultUnion
default.  This is all happening in 
defaultUK
default shell companies
default: 
defaultUK
default limited liability partnerships registered in office blocks probably not that far from here. 
defaultLord Wakeham:default The more you give that answer, the more you come back to the question I asked: why did the Government, knowing this was going to happen, agree to it in 2000?
defaultRichard Murphy:default We have to remember what was happeni
defaultng in 2000. The 
defaultenvironment was very different from what it is now.  First of all, we were at the absolute height of the tax avoidance industry in professional firms.  This was the era when
default 
defaultall the prosecutions 
defaultfor 
defaulttax abuse in the States of the large firms were 
defaultbrought. The 
defaultsale of structured tax avoidance schemes was very significant, and it was not being noticed on the public radar.  There was simply no attention drawn to this at that time.  There was no movement looking at it.  There was no press interested in it.  The awareness of tax avoidance was very low and it simply slipped below the radar.  The one thing that I remember 
defaultfrom 
default2000, which everybody was aware of, was 
defaultbeing able to 
defaultcreate 
defaulta 
defaultnon
default&#x2011;
defaultresident organisation apparently trading in the 
defaultUK
default with a 
defaultUK
default trading presence but no residents and no tax.  Otherwise, I do not think the issue was seriously discussed.  
defaultLord Bilimoria:default Can I just ask both of you, based on Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultBrooks’ comment, about the fact that when this was created it created huge amounts of extra legislation and extra rules to an already over
default&#x2011;
defaultcomplicated and over
default&#x2011;
defaultburdened tax rule book and system?  Surely with the Finance Bill now and what it is suggesting 
defaultwith regard to 
defaultthe tax policy, an already overburdened tax system 
defaultwill be made 
defaulteven more so, especially with a self
default&#x2011;
defaultassessment regime and with the Office of Tax Simplification almost seeming an oxymoron.
defaultRichard Murphy:default Yes.  What is clearly not being thought about here, and 
defaultthis 
defaultrelates very much to the second part of the question, is an overall policy direction with regard to this.  This legislation creates some complete anomalies in 
defaultUK
default tax law.  For example, you can have now two individuals form their own separate limited companies—single member companies—and then go into joint venture with each other through an LLP
default. B
defaultoth those single companies will be looked through for tax purposes and will be charged to income tax.  In other words, the entire corporate structure of limited liability can be ignored and income tax will be paid.  Yet if they formed a company together, they could then be taxed to corporation tax, pay out the entire reward of the whole structure as dividends, pay no PAYE or 
defaultnational insurance
default and 
defaultprobably 
defaultnobody would ask a question, because IR35 has, frankly, little impact for most companies and is subject to relatively few inquiries.  The Revenue simply does not have the staff to ask.  We create a completely anomalous position by this where we have a failure of horizontal equity within the tax system.  
defaultW
defaulte need to go back and ask the real question, which is: how should small businesses be taxed?  
defaultI hear
defaultd
default the previous panellists say that they could see no reason 
defaultfor having 
defaultdifferences in approach for large and small businesses.  I have to admit 
defaultthat 
defaultI simply do not agree.  Small businesses are very, very different entities from large partnerships and large corporate entities, and would clearly need a different approach.  This new legislation will create real burdens for consideration by many smaller partnerships, which are probably unnecessary.  If you look at the data from John
default&#xa0;
defaultWhiting’s report, you will see that the vast majority of LLPs have three or fewer members.  They are either the sort that should be subject to review because they involve corporate members of the type Richard is describing or, frankly, they are genuine trading partnerships, in which case they should drop out of consideration.  
defaultThe big issue, though, is always to look at the number that are dissolved each year.  That is the most interesting information.  At least 50% of the number registered each year are dissolved.  They never normally submit their tax returns or accounts, and that is where the fraud is going on in particular.  
defaultQ35 default&#xa0; 
defaultBaroness Blackstone:default Turning to the draft legislation and what it says about salaried members, the changes that are proposed in the draft Bill are not going to rely on general partnership law to determine whether a member of an LLP is a partner or an employee for tax purposes.  Indeed, they are going to introduce some rather detailed and mechanical tests.  Would it not have been simpler and probably more coherent to have extended the general partnership law rules to LLPs, and why do you think the Government chose not to? 
defaultRichard Brooks:default As I explained earlier, I have not looked at the details of these new laws greatly, but the simplest thing to do would have been not to have introduced limited liability partnerships in the first place.  This really does show that if you do not think about what you are doing adequately to start with, you end up with this mess years, even decades, on.  I thought it was interesting that Chris
default&#xa0;
defaultSanger earlier on 
defaultalluded
default to this when he talked about the importance of consulting on the details as legislation is being developed.  That is all very well, but you have to consult the right people.  You have to consult the people who will make these difficult points, who will argue with you.  There is a danger that the consultation that people like Chris
default&#xa0;
defaultSanger thinks is working really well is working really well within their own club, but nobody else is allowed in that club.  There is an example of that in the controlled foreign companies laws.  Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultSanger said that the consultation on that had worked really well.  In fact, in this Finance Bill they have already had to come back and tighten it up because they did not listen to people who were saying, “Hang on, these controlled foreign companies laws you are bringing in are a major threat to the 
defaultUK
default tax base”.  
defaultI am sorry to slightly digress from your specific point about partnerships
default,
default and 
defaultmaybe 
defaultwe can get back to that when you talk generally about the consultation process, but it just proves, as you see
default, that there are 
defaultall these difficulties
default, and 
defaultyou are now asking, “What would be the best way of correcting this 
defaultvery difficult mess we are in?”
default.
default Obviously, you should not really have got into it in the first place.  
defaultRichard Murphy:default I do not understand a lot about the new rules.  They are clearly written for a very limited number of partnerships.  Let us just look at a couple of examples as to why that is the case.  I was a member of a three
default&#x2011;
defaultpartner firm of accountants for many years.  We were not an LLP in those days.  We had very occasionally minuted partners’ meetings, but we had a partners’ meeting every day.  We normally walked off and bought a sandwich together at lunchtime and resolved the issues of the day during the course of going to buy a sandwich and coming back again.  Now, of course we were all active.  Could we prove it under the test that is currently being requested?  I am not sure we would, in that sense, very easily pass.  
defaultThe rules being put forward with regard to capital requirements seem to me to be based upon another era of business.  The number of businesses that require, in small partnerships, a partner to contribute a quarter of their expected annual earnings in capital is tiny.  My LLP does not require that; it clearly does not.  I am a knowledge
default&#x2011;
defaultbased business.  I do not need to put in a quarter of my annual income to fund the purchase of a few Apple Macs
default:
default one here, one at home and another in my pocket and that is it.  How much capital d
defaulto I really need?  Very little.
defaultThe ideas are pretty poorly structured inside the new legislation, so to say that they are importing and creating new ideas that do not really work is absolutely true.  We are creating new tests that are inappropriate.  We should be looking at the fundamental badges of trade and, frankly, most of these partnerships, with regard to these artificial members, would fail the fundamental badges of whether these people are in trade or not that come up under existing Revenue approaches; or, under the settlements legislation, whether an artificial member 
defaultis 
defaultincluded, frankly, because they are a spouse of the main partner, which is an issue that is not discussed.  
defaultBaroness Blackstone:default Do you think the proposed measures go far enough in blocking the opportunity to disguise employment income as self
default&#x2011;
defaultemployed profit? 
defaultRichard Murphy:default In terms of tackling the large partnerships, they are probably going to be reasonably, but not wholly, effective.  It is not beyond the wit of most lawyers to rewrite their partnership agreements and come up with structures that will suggest that everybody has a participation role in the management of the partnership to get round these rules.  I suspect that is what is going on feverishly in a great many offices around the City right now, to be honest.  There may well be some arrangements being put in place for people to be contributing extra capital to their firm from junior partners, with some interesting loan arrangements to structure them, according to some of the, again, legal press.  So there will be thoughts going on about how to get round the new rules, inevitably, but rather 
defaultas Richard commented 
defaultit is the wrong question.  We have a massive problem with regard to PAYE and 
defaultnational insurance
default abuse, which is the hundreds of thousands of small firms that are not paying any and yet the issue that is being picked on is the relatively small number of partnerships that are doing the same thing.  Will it amount to the same level of abuse?  I do not know.  I do not think it has been quantified sufficiently well, but the bigger problem is not being addressed.  
defaultQ36 default&#xa0; 
defaultBaroness Wheatcroft:default I would like to explore an area that seems like another unnecessary complication in some ways
default:
default the issue of mixed membership partnerships and when should profit go to the corporate partner.  What is the intention behind that, and are you confident the changes being proposed are an improvement?
defaultRichard Brooks:default That is not really something 
defaultthat 
defaultI have looked at, I am afraid.  
defaultRichard Murphy:default I first came across mixed partnerships very early after LLPs were introduced.  The first one I came across was another chartered accountant, who told me he had created a mixed partnership because, he said, “It is anomalous”.  Companies can have one member, but an LLP has to have two, so he had formed a company, which he owned, to be his own partner, so 
defaultthat 
defaulthe could have LLP status.  That is quite common, by the way.  I think that is done frequently, and the corporate member in those cases is a mere nominee getting £1 a year or whatever—peppercorn.  I certainly think that was common in the first place, but then it became obvious to some people that they could shelter income in this way.  
defaultOne of the previous witnesses said you surely should not be allowed to mix and match.  You either choose to be a corporate entity and therefore 
defaultto 
defaultbe able to shield your retained profits from tax, or you should choose the advantages of an LLP and accept the consequences of the structure.  What has quite clearly happened is that a number of lawyers and accountants have decided to do that mixing and matching.  I think that is inappropriate.  A number of anti
default&#x2011;
defaultavoidance measures would have come to me before these ones.  For example, requiring the withholding of tax at source on payment of profits to a corporate entity would be an obvious exercise to overcome the problems that Richard is addressing in some of the points he is making.  That would have helped no end and increased tax yield.  The other one would be to say, “No, you cannot have a corporate entity as a member and most certainly you cannot have a corporate entity not tax-resident in the 
defaultUK
default as a member”, but that is the problem we have.  
defaultBaroness Wheatcroft:default Do you think that the changes now being proposed will make it less attractive to have a corporate entity as a member?
defaultRichard Murphy:default Yes, clearly it will make it less attractive.  Will there be some use that will be found for corporate members still?  I am sure there will be, because we are talking about commonalties of ownership, and there will be arrangements that people will find to get around that.  I am sure some trust structures will be put in between the members of the LLP and the corporate entity to overcome the problem at some point, which have not been anticipated so far.  However, the most absurd of the new rules that we have is that this new rule with regard to corporate members does not apply to an LLP trading in the 
defaultUK
default incorporated outside the 
defaultUK
default.  That, to me, is completely baffling.  Why does it only apply to UK LLPs?  Why is it not applied to LLPs incorporated in Cayman or BVI or wherever else?  I just do not understand that.  
defaultBaroness Wheatcroft:default It sounds as if you are saying in the interests of tax simplification—an issue for Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultWhiting maybe in the future—we should just stop having corporate members.  
defaultRichard Murphy:default Yes
default.  
defaultRichard Brooks:default You will upset a certain former Prime Minister.
defaultQ37 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Leigh of Hurley:default 
defaultThe question about the structure of whether or not it is an employee or a partner and the detail of that is the right question, but I think you are the wrong people to ask.  
defaultThe right question to ask you is about the LLP global situation, rather than the detail.  If we had not had LLP legislation in the 
defaultUK
default, d
defaulto you not think that
default people would have gone offshore, because 
defaultLLP
default legislation is in many jurisdictions outside the 
defaultUK
default?  Y
defaultou
defaultr
default suggest
defaultion that
default we just do not have 
defaultLLP legislation, which
default 
defaultis essentially what I think you are saying, would not be advantageous to the UK economy at all, would it?
defaultRichard Brooks:default You can address that through licensing.  Price
default W
defaultaterhouse, now PricewaterhouseCoopers, 
defaultis 
defaultgoing to continue with a big accountancy practice in 
defaultBritain
default.  The idea that, “We will go to 
defaultJersey
default”
default,
default is in many ways an empty threat
default,
default and that was the threat, but it is also one that is easily dealt with by the kind of permissions you give them to operate.  That seems to me far preferable to just rolling over.
defaultRichard Murphy:default As far as I can see, there is no risk from LLP legislation arising from within the EU.  The risk of use of LLP legislation arises from countries outside the EU.  That is important from the point of view of the right to incorporate, which of course is granted under the 
defaultMaastricht
default&#xa0;
defaultt
defaultreaty, and the freedom to choose where to incorporate.  Therefore, we could take sanction against LLPs incorporated outside the EU.  We could simply deem them to be corporations, subject therefore to registration in the 
defaultUK
default as if they are corporate entities, subject to corporate tax, subject to PAYE.  That problem would therefore be closed overnight, except for the fact that Companies
default&#xa0;
defaultHouse is extremely poor at registering overseas
default&#x2011;
defaultregistered limited liability entities trading in the 
defaultUK
default.  The number is tiny.  I cannot believe there are as few as are registered at Companies
default&#xa0;
defaultHouse, because 
defaultthe number of 
defaultat their annual reports is very small, and I suspect we have many more overseas LLPs trading here than are recorded even now.  Every single overseas LLP trading here now should be registered, but I suspect it is not.
defaultLord Leigh of Hurley:default 
defaultTo be fair to the large firms of accountants, I think there were a number of them where the LLP was based in 
defaultSwitzerland
default, and that is how they got through that time in 2000.  However, in terms of the current proposals—
defaultRichard Murphy:default I think they were 
defaultV
defaultereins, were they not, rather than LLPs, which are slightly different entities; it is the same as foundations are not the same as trusts, etc.
defaultLord Leigh of Hurley:default 
defaultThe
defaultre was
default that as well
default, but also LLPs. 
default 
defaultI
defaultn the current proposals, what else would you like to see 
defaultto stymie tax avoidance and NIC avoidance?  
defaultYou mentioned 
defaultyou would like to see no corporate LLPs.  
defaultWhat else would you like to see
default that would increase the tax take, which is really what we are trying to look at here
default?
default 
defaultRichard Brooks:default I do not know on the tax haven.  One thing you perhaps ought to have is if you are not going to ban corporate members of LLPs, you should at least insist there is a natural person LLP.  At the moment, there is no requirement to have a natural person as a member within an LLP.  I do not know how that affects the tax take, but it certainly affects the use of LLPs as money-laundering vehicles, because you do not even need anybody’s name on Companies
default&#xa0;
defaultHouse records to set up an LLP.
defaultRichard Murphy:default I stress the point I made earlier: 
defaultthat 
defaultfor smaller businesses there are always, in a sense, better tax avoidance opportunities available in current 
defaultUK
default law than setting up an LLP.  You can always avoid more 
defaultnational insurance
default by incorporating at present than you can by forming an LLP, so it is not at that end of the scale that this is the problem.  The problem is very much at the larger end where you have artificial employment.  The Revenue was targeting that.  My concern is that the rules they are putting in place will be too easy to get round, candidly.  You have a one-in-three test to get around it and it is not going to be a substantial hurdle for some people to put in place structures to circumvent these new rules, so I am not sure how much is really going to be raised.
defaultLord Leigh of Hurley:default 
defaultYou are talking about what 
defaultHMRC call the ABC definitions, and you are saying that any of those can be circumvented or 
defaultall
default those can be circumvented.
defaultRichard Murphy:default Probably, in time, all of them will be circumvented.  I really do not doubt that if you put in rules of that sort, which are not that complicated, somebody will find a way around them and you only have to get into one category to avoid being considered an employee.  I suspect the one that is going to be easiest to get around is the management participation.  We heard earlier about Ernst
default&#xa0;
default&amp;
default&#xa0;
defaultYoung having a 500
default&#x2011;
defaultmember webcast partnership meeting.  I think those will become common.  
defaultQ38 default&#xa0; 
defaultBaroness Drake:default I 
defaultwill, if I may, 
defaultgo to the issue of the G
defaultovernment’s new approach to tax 
defaultpolicy-making, which 
defaultthey are
default committed to following apart from the exceptions of the tax rates themselves, measures to protect tax revenues or where there is a risk of forestalling
default. M
defaulty first question is: do
default you think the Government have
default invoked this get-out clause too often
default,
default when it does not seek to follow the new approach, or have they got it about right? 
defaultRichard Brooks:default In the areas I have looked at, they have been far too open with one group of people and completely closed to another group.  The prime example is the controlled foreign companies laws
default, which
default have been amended in the last three Finance Bills extensively.  That consultation that Chris
default&#xa0;
defaultSanger from Ernst
default&#xa0;
default&amp;
default&#xa0;
defaultYoung was very pleased with has led to some major relaxations and some major tax reduction opportunities.  They do not count as tax avoidance because they are on the face of the statute.  They have been developed in such close partnership with the companies 
defaultthat 
defaultstand to benefit from them and the 
defaultadviser
defaults who are going to advise on applying them that there are all kinds of massive opportunities that probably would not have existed if there had been a more open consultation with people who would not benefit from them.  I looked into how these laws would work at some length.  I did a lengthy investigation for 
defaultPrivate Eye 
defaultmagazine involving posing as a tax consultant and talking to the big four accountancy firms, 
defaultwhich 
defaulttold me that representing a British multinational company I could wipe out my 
defaultUK
default tax bill using these new CFC laws.  When I put that to HMRC, they would not admit that for weeks until forced to by the evidence, but that was the law.  However, they had, it transpired, informed the big four accountancy firms of that fact.  This had become an entirely undemocratic process in which the effect of the law was being kept from the public, but it was being shared with a circle who now come here and say that consultation is working extremely well.  It is, in their terms, but it is producing all kinds of problems in the tax system.  
defaultFollowing that exposure, in the Autumn Statement the Chancellor announced that there would be a tightening up of these laws, so he has had to go back already, and we are back in the same kind of process we were with limited liability partnerships.  The question is not when the Treasury and the Revenue should close shop
default; it 
defaultis that in general they need to be far more open with everybody, including the people who do not agree with their approach and maybe even their critics, but that is not something they are prepared to do at the moment.  
defaultBaroness Drake:default So your point is 
defaultthat 
defaultyou think the consultation is operating to give undue
default influence to certain players. 
defaultRichard Brooks:default Yes, it is an understatement to say that the devil is in the detail with the tax system.  The entire effect of certain tax laws is in the detail, and if that is hammered out in private conversations that the public, media and critics are not privy to, you end up with very one
default&#x2011;
defaultsided tax legislation.  That might be the intention, but it is an intention that the Government and the Treasury ought to be honest about from the start.
defaultBaroness Drake:default Do you think there are any improvements in taxation legislation flowing from their new approach?  Do you think there are any upsides, any positives
default,
default from it?  
defaultRichard Brooks:default On certain relatively uncontroversial technical matters there probably are.  I am prepared to believe the people who say that this process is working on that level.  However, it is a very high price to pay if you are giving one group, one set of vested interests
default,
default their own way.
defaultRichard Murphy:default I forgot to look it up before I came
default,
default and I apologise for that, but it occurred to me on the way here that I did some research, which I think was published in about 2008.  We looked at several years’ Finance Acts to see how much of legislation was straightforward anti
default&#x2011;
defaultavoidance legislation, and at least 40% could fall into that category, where the Government would 
defaultprobably 
defaultneed to have used the opt
default&#x2011;
defaultout to ensure that revenue was protected.  That was the purpose of the legislation.  Therefore, I would personally expect this opt
default&#x2011;
defaultout to be used quite often, simply because it is necessary because quite a large part of legislation is created for that reason.  Of course, I would argue
default,
default and I have argued it here before
default,
default that if we had a proper general anti
default&#x2011;
defaultavoidance principle, not a general anti
default&#x2011;
defaultabuse rule, we may get round some of those problems, but that is probably not the purpose of this afternoon.  
defaultLooking at the process of consultation, I have been involved in a number of ways.  I quite often find that I am the only person submi
defaulttting to a consultation to HMRC, which
default frankly does not come from a very large organisation
default,
default and you will find that that is commonplace.  There will be a long list of the usual big firms of accountants, banks, lawyers and then Tax
default&#xa0;
defaultResearch
default&#xa0;
defaultLLP, which for these purposes, by and large, is represented by me.  That is the way it works.  The consultation process is still restricted to a tiny number of people.  
defaultThat was also evident when I was involved with the general anti
default&#x2011;
defaultabuse rule, where I sat on the consultation committee.  What was quite surprising was the very limited range of people from whom that consultation was drawn
default,
default and 
defaultthe fact 
defaultthat those who were working for the Revenue on that consultation were at least 50% secondees from the same type of organisation that was making the submission.  We therefore have tax policy being created by a tiny number of organisations and inside the Treasury
default and 
defaultthe Revenue
default,
default and the consultation respondents all seem to be the same type of people.  
defaultBaroness Drake:default So you are basically saying
default that 
defaultgiven the importance of tax avoidance legislation, you would expect the get out clause to be used quite often.
defaultRichard Murphy:default I would expect it to be used quite often, yes, but we need to think much more radically about how we are going to deal with the creation of tax policy.  
defaultQ39 default&#xa0; 
defaultBaroness Drake:default Taking the package 
defaultfor 
defaultpartnership taxation, which we are looking at, how effective or efficient do you think the new approach has been in coming up with that package?  Maybe 
defaultyou could outline 
defaultsome strengths and weaknesses in what the process has produced. 
defaultRichard Murphy:default Richard has said we should never have started with LLPs.  If we were going to start 
defaultwith 
defaultthis consultation, I would be surprised if most people would have expected 
defaultus to 
defaulthave reached the point we have.  The new rules are surprising.  They do not reflect the reality of what goes on inside most LLPs.  They are quite artificial in terms of the tests that are being applied
default, so t
defaulthey will be open to abuse.  I think Professor
default&#xa0;
defaultFreedman was accurate in saying that the people who might be involved in creating some of this draft legislation and the processes inside the Treasury do not have the experience for what happens inside the commercial world, and I do not think they reflect that.  For very many small LLPs, frankly, the best thing the Revenue could have done was 
defaultto say that 
defaultthere has to be a cut
default&#x2011;
defaultoff point where we are looking at something different.  That is a very important point.  If you look at the whole process of consultation, even the whole approach inside the Revenue and the Treasury, there is a relatively widespread understanding of what happens in big business and big partnerships, because they are the people who are being consulted and they are even on the board of HMRC.  There is no small practitioner on the board of HMRC
default; 
defaultonly large firms 
defaultare 
defaultrepresented.  
defaultN
defaulto small business 
defaultis 
defaultrepresented; only large business is represented.  
defaultThere are very few 
defaultconsultation responses, because they do not have the resources or the funding to do it
default. They are very often 
defaultnot aware of it.  That is giving rise to a significant bias that is imposing burdens on small businesses where, frankly, we need to start again and say, “What structures would work?”
default.
default  If I was to look at this, I would say
default that
default it is time to go back
default and 
defaultlook at the whole structure of small companies and differentiate those from large companies; they are not the same beast.  To pretend that BP is the same as the one
default&#x2011;
defaultperson limited liability company, or even a large limited company
default, is absurd
default.  To pretend that all partnerships are the same is absurd.  We are trying to come up with solutions that are simply answering the wrong questions at the moment, and that is partly because of a failure of the consultation process to involve the right people.  There are good people out there who should be consulted.  I can think immediately of Rebecca
default&#xa0;
defaultBenneyworth, who is the Chair of the ICAEW’s Tax Faculty at the moment, an excellent small practitioner and a tax lecturer who clearly knows her material.  We do not agree on everything but I think she would be great, but she is not involved in these processes and she should be.  There is a failure there to ask the right people the right questions and, as a result, we get the wrong answers, and that is shown time and again in the consultation process.  
defaultBaroness Drake:default What do you say are the top two weaknesses in this partnership taxation package that have come as a result of this approach, if you had to nominate two
default—j
defaultust to pin you down to what you think are the two key ones
default?
defaultRichard Murphy:default I would support Richard’s view that we need to have an identifiable 
defaultUK
default human being who is a member of a partnership.  Even in the Isle of Man they now require there to be an identifiable person to be a member of a company in the 
defaultIsle of Man
default, because they realise the problems of not having somebody they can contact locally to nail down responsibility for management of an entity.  Yet we do not have that in UK LLP law, which does seem to be quite extraordinary.  I do not often praise the 
defaultIsle of Man
default, but I will on this issue.  Secondly, the question should arise: why are we allowing corporate members?  We are trying to deal with it by tackling an abuse when we should be saying, “You should not be there”.  
defaultThe Chairman:default Going back to your point about the number of organisations and firms that are consulted in consultation processes, you are almost suggesting that there is a bit of a closed shop there.  To what extent is it because the vast majority of smaller individuals—smaller in the sense of very small businesses and so on—just simply lack the time, the resources or the expertise to make a real contribution?  
defaultRichard Murphy:default The expertise does exist in some firms.  It clearly does not in all, but it most certainly does in some.  There are some very good smaller practices in the 
defaultUK
default.  The problem is that there is a closed shop, because the people who have a real impact on the consultation process are not those who make the written submissions; they are those who will turn up and have the face-to-face meetings in the Treasury, and very few smaller firms will be invited in to do that, I suspect.  
defaultThe Chairman:default Do they make written submissions? 
defaultRichard Murphy:default No, because in my experience, frankly, you can write in as many written submissions as you like, and I sometimes feel it is necessary to do so, but I am not sure they are listened to, and I suspect many firms would feel the same way.  You can make submissions and you do not see any consequence of the submission process.  Again, one of the previous witnesses was 
defaultasking 
defaultwhat the outcome of the process
default was.
default  It is very hard to see what happens as a result of the consultation, and I think that is a difficulty.  There is not enough recognition that those who are making submissions have been listened to
default,
default and therefore the reward for effort expended is very low, apart from the fact that you are not being paid to do it in most cases, so these firms do not bother.  
defaultWe need to invest a lot more heavily in this country in taxation policy.  It is fundamental to the way we run our economy.  It is fundamental to the way in which small business operates
default,
default and yet the Revenue 
defaultis not willing to go out among
default the smaller business practitioners and ask them, “What do you know?  How do you want policy to be put forward?”
default.
default  There are responsible people who would take part in that, but it would require funding.  They cannot all afford to do it for free.  
defaultM
defaultoney 
defaultneeds to be 
defaultput forward to do that, and I cannot see why not.  In the States, this sort of research is well funded by the Senate and the House.  Here there is no money available to advise on it.  Why not?  
defaultQ40 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Rowedefault&#x2011;defaultBeddoe:default The question that I have to ask has been comprehensively covered by both Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultMurphy and 
defaultMr
default&#xa0;
defaultBrooks
default, so I would just like to make a general comment about consultation.  This Committee produced a report in 2011, and our excellent advisers have reminded us of what was said.  When I look at it, listen to what you are saying and read the recommendations that this report made, I just want the small businesses of this country, 
defaultwhich
default feel that they are not being consulted
default,
default to feel that they are not alone, because these recommendations that were made by this Committee I do not think have been taken into account by anybody.
defaultRichard Brooks:default You can look at lists of organisations 
defaultthat 
defaultmeet Ministers
default and see who 
defaultmeets the Chancellor and who meets the Exchequer Secretary, David
default&#xa0;
defaultGauke.  I just printed out the quarter leading up to the 2013 Budget, which is the most recent and relevant one available.  The list of organisations he is meeting is dominated by the accountancy bodies
default,
default and at the top of their list are the big corporate tax changes.  That is where the money is.  There is one meeting, in February 2013, with the Federation of Small Businesses, but that is it—one meeting.  That is the same as Amazon alone had.  You will find a similar pattern if you look at the meetings of senior officials in the Treasury.  It is completely distorted, and of course there are no campaigners on tax; there are no 
defaultnon
default&#x2011;
defaultgovernmental organisations that 
defaulthave done a lot of work on tax and take alternative views.  They simply do not feature.  The Treasury and the Revenue do not want to know them.  
defaultI mentioned an investigation I did into the effect of the new controlled foreign companies laws a few moments ago.  I found out a huge amount there about how those laws were being applied
default. 
defaultI asked to meet the Revenue to talk about them and they refused.  They simply will not meet critics.  You may recall that episode that was shown on 
default“
defaultPanorama
default”
default where one of the Government’s advisers on avoidance talked about the Chancellor’s “grubby mitts”.  I filmed that at that training course.  On those training courses I picked up a huge amount of intelligence on corporate and personal tax planning ideas.  I have bumf that big to give the Revenue if they want it.  They will not meet to discuss those issues.  They will happily take copies of the paper, but they will not meet to discuss tax avoidance with a critic.  That is how closed it has become and they are seriously shooting themselves in the foot.  That is why we end up with 
defaultthe 
defaultflawed legislation 
defaultthat 
defaultwe have in the shape of the co
defaultntrolled foreign companies laws, which 
defaultthey will have to come back to again and again to shore up the tax base because they will not listen to people who from the outset will say, “That is not going to work because of A, B and C, and here is evidence”.  They drastically need to open up.
defaultLord Rowedefault&#x2011;defaultBeddoe:default To be very specific, 
defaultthen, 
defaultwe recommend
defaulted
default strongly that HMRC and the Treasury find more effective ways of consulting smaller businesses and non
default&#x2011;
defaultbusiness stakeholders.  Have you seen any change?
defaultRichard Murphy:default No.  
defaultRichard Brooks:default No.  You need a cultural change at the top of these organisations, so that the people they want to meet and the people they want to talk to are not just the captains of industry and the partners in the big accountancy firms.  They need to see their priorities differently.
defaultRichard Murphy:default Can I go back to the point that HMRC’s board deliberately represent
defaults
default big business community—the non
default&#x2011;
defaultexecutives?  They are not the only taxpayers in this country.  They are important, but they are by no means the only important grouping, and so other people 
defaultneed to be 
defaultrepresented there.  However, when that body is exclusive, everything else that flows from the top down 
defaultsuggests, “They are
default the people who matter.  Do not talk to anybody else”
default.
default  
defaultThe Chairman:default You have made your point and it is an issue 
defaultthat 
defaultwe will take up when they come in front of us.  We are coming to the last area now. 
defaultQ41 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Bilimoria:default We have been talking about consultation.  What about the Government’s commitment to evaluating the effectiveness of tax reforms to ensure that they are meeting their objectives?  In your view, how rigorously have HMRC and the Treasury met this commitment in respect of tax legislation introduced since 2010 and what could be done to improve their monitoring and evaluation arrangements? 
defaultRichard Murphy:default I wish I could tell you what their objectives were
default 
defaultin most cases
default.  Let me give you one simple example.  The Prime Minister last year was very keen to say that he was going to tackle offshore tax abuse whil
defaulte
default at the same time moving the 
defaultUK
default from a residence
default&#x2011;
defaultbased corporation tax to a territorial
default&#x2011;
defaultbased corporation tax, which substantially increased the opportunities for offshore tax abuse by 
defaultUK
default companies.  The two moves were quite clearly in conflict one with the other.  How, as a consequence, can anybody undertake a review of outcome against objectives when it was not clear what 
defaultg
defaultovernment policy was in this area?  Were they trying to encourage businesses to move profits offshore or were they trying to encourage businesses to move profits onshore?  It just was not apparent.  Legislation said one thing
default, 
defaultpolicy statement said another.  Until they are clear about what they are trying to achieve and speak with one consistent tone, an evaluation process is always going to be a failure
default,
default and I have seen no evidence that that evaluation process is therefore taking place in any effective way at all.
defaultRichard Brooks:default I agree completely with Richard.  There are public objectives and private objectives and sometimes they differ greatly, particularly in the area of international corporate tax, so it become
defaults
default very difficult to judge their performance on that, but it is all tied in with the consultation process.  That gap between what they are really trying to do and what they say they are trying to do would not be so wide if the whole process was opened up and people who do not agree with them necessarily, people who they find a bit uncomfortable, were allowed to come and discuss and analyse their proposals, rather than them being kept within this closed shop of officials, Ministers and big accountancy firms, lawyers and big corporations.  If you opened that up, you close that gap and then we can judge whether they are performing much better.  
defaultLord Bilimoria:default Are you saying that you have not even seen one good example of post
default&#x2011;
defaultimplementation review?
defaultRichard Brooks:default I have not looked closely enough.
defaultRichard Murphy:default My answer is no, I cannot think of one.  I am sorry
default, 
defaultI cannot think of 
defaultanything 
defaultI have seen that really gives me confidence that there is an effective process going on, no.  If it is going to go on, it has to be done independently.  It has to be financed and undertaken by people who are outside the Treasury and HMRC.  It has to be a proper process to appraise this.  It cannot be done by an internal process, because then the pressure to confirm that what you found is consistent with what was expected is too high.  You have to have the ability to criticise with freedom.  It is like the internal auditor role.  If the internal auditor reports to the managing director, you cannot achieve the role.  They have to report to an audit committee.  It has to be outside the system.  At the moment it is not and therefore the process cannot work.  The right governance procedures are not in place.
defaultQ42 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Bilimoria:default 
defaultLi
defaultnked to this, part of any process and monitoring of tax rules is spotting quickly whether ways have been found to circumvent them or abuse them.  How effectively do you think HMRC performs this task?  
defaultRichard Murphy:default I think Richard has answered that.  
defaultRichard Brooks:default There are examples of where they have done a pretty good job of spotting the abuse of tax laws.  A lot of work has been done in recent years on avoidance schemes using partnerships, things like the film investment schemes that were up to no good.  They did some pretty good work there, but it is 
defaulta matter of 
defaultcleaning up after the event a lot of the time.  Their appetite for doing that varies according to the taxpayer who is involved.  Where the highest profile person you have is a comedian using a type of tax structure, they are pretty keen to get on to that and get their success out there, which is fair enough.  However, when it is in other areas, 
defaultsuch as 
defaulta big multinational exploiting some tax rules for tax avoidance or a very powerful non
default&#x2011;
defaultdomiciled individual, they are less keen on spotting the abuse and clamping down.  
defaultThe Chairman:default Gentlemen, I think we are beginning to become a bit repetitive with the same points.  We have had a very long session, but you have certainly made your points on these latter things to us very clearly.  Can I thank you again, as you have done before, for coming and giving us evidence?  Thank you.

default
