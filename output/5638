[normal]Examination of Witnesses[bold]Richard Brooks[bold], 
[normal]a
[normal]uthor and journalist, and 
[normal]Richard Murphy[bold], Director, Tax Research LLP 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q32 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Good afternoon, Mr
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Murphy and 
[normal]Mr
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Brooks
[normal], and thank you very much indeed for coming again to be with us today.  I hope you will agree that we can go straight to questions.
[normal]Richard Murphy:[bold] Can I just disclose?  I think it is important, because Lord
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Joffe is a 
[normal]m
[normal]ember of this Committee, that I record that his charitable trust pay
[normal]s
[normal] me a grant for work on accounting and taxation mainly in 
[normal]Africa
[normal].
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Lord
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Joffe has declared that as well.  Can we start with a very general question?  You have been sitting and listening to 
[normal]all
[normal] this and have heard our previous witnesses, so can I just have your views as to the advantages, both commercial and tax, of structuring a business as a partnership rather than as a company?  Apart from the obvious limitation of liability, what additional advantages might LLPs, as distinct from general partnerships, offer their members? 
[normal]Richard Murphy:[bold] I am a member of two LLPs, so I have some experience in this area.  The clear advantage for many people with regard to an LLP over a conventional partnership will be the formulised structure, which provide
[normal]s
[normal] a legal protection, in part, from your other partners, which in a general partnership I would generally rate to be the biggest risk you face, candidly, and something to be avoided at all costs, if possible.  I have never seen bigger consequences of a partnership than people falling out with each other, and that is in my previous role as a professional adviser where I have seen that happen often.  That I would put as number one.  
[normal]It is very important to say that in tax terms a partnership is not as advantageous for most people as a limited company, because we are ignoring the fact that when compared to the vast majority of partnerships—90% of partnerships are small and over half turn
[normal] 
[normal]over less than the VAT limit—the vast majority of small companies will pay little or no 
[normal]national insurance
[normal].  Members will be taking out their rewards by dividends and therefore little or no PAYE and 
[normal]national insurance
[normal] will be paid, whereas the members of a partnership do pay 
[normal]c
[normal]lass
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2 and 
[normal]c
[normal]lass
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4 
[normal]national insurance
[normal].  So, by and large, the tax liability in smaller partnerships, which are the most common, is higher in a partnership than it is in a company these days, and most people would therefore choose a company over a partnership.  Therefore, a partnership structure is chosen for other reasons.  There are significant administrative advantages to a partnership.  I certainly find those appealing.  The fact that a partner can withdraw funds during the course of the year without paying PAYE on that occasion
[normal] means that 
[normal]there is flexibility.  In that sense, there is flexibility with regard to repayment of capital, because the capital needs of some businesses obviously fluctuate.  There is cash flow.  Tax is paid twice a year on 31
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]January and 31
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]July.  That clearly helps some partnerships and it is seen as an advantage.  For very many people it will be a reputation issue; it looks like a professional structure as well.  Personally, I was told by my professional indemnity insurers 
[normal]that 
[normal]I had to differentiate my own affairs from being a sole practitioner as a chartered accountant when I was undertaking the sort of work 
[normal]that 
[normal]I do for 
[normal]Tax Research
[normal], and so it gave me a separate legal i
[normal]dentity.  
[normal]The numbers of reasons involved are very high, therefore.  There is no simple answer, and I think Malcolm
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Gammie made that clear as well.  There are some advantages, but we should not ignore the fact that it is not normally, in smaller businesses, tax motivated.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] In smaller businesses.
[normal]Richard Murphy:[bold] In smaller business it is not.  
[normal]Q33 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] If we can take the large growth in LLPs and look at the larger businesses
[normal], 
[normal]you have partly answered this but do you think this growth has been driven mainly by tax considerations or are others even more important? 
[normal]Richard Murphy:[bold] If you look at what is happening—and I have been following quite a lot of literature—particularly in the law profession at the moment with regard to reactions to the proposed legislation, you will see a great many articles coming out suggesting that firms are having to review their partnership structures quite radically.  They are quite concerned that a great many junior partners, who would have previously been on PAYE even though supposedly having partnership status, are now members of the LLP with a guaranteed income; that is clearly tax-motivated.  I do not think there is much doubt that in the larger firms there has been a significant tax advantage to the
[normal] use of the LLP structure while
[normal] offering considerable indemnity in a very simple legal form compared to the previous arrangements that existed before LLPs were available for professional firms, where indemnity arrangements had to be put in place for the salaried partners.  This is a much simpler structure.  It is much easier for them to create an LLP and indemnify the so
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]called salary of junior partners and get a tax saving at the same time, so there is a very big difference in behaviour amongst the larger partnerships and the smaller ones here.
[normal]Richard Brooks:[bold] In terms of the advantages, it is worth going right back to the origins of UK LLPs.  
[normal]T
[normal]hey were set up really to offer accountants in particular, particularly the big accountancy firms, the best of both worlds.  They wanted the advantages of a partnership.  They talk about the cultural advantages, but really the main one was the tax advantage of being a partner and not a director.  They also wanted to limit their liabilities.  This goes back to the mid
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]1990s.  There had been a series of accountancy scandals.  They feared that if they were sued they would lose their houses, so the tax and the legal treatment were divorced and what you have seen in recent years with the range of tax avoidance techniques using th
[normal]ese vehicles is the consequence
[normal] of that.  This is how to screw up the tax system
[normal]: 
[normal]start with a fundamental breakdown of the economic and tax results
[normal] and 
[normal]separate the two in this way.  
[normal]There is a brilliant pamphlet that I have brought along, written by Professor
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Prem
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Sikka from 
[normal]Essex
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]University
[normal] with Austin
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Mitchell and Jim
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Cousins, who you might know, which talks about the origins of LLPs in the 1990s.  The big accountancy firms, led by Price
[normal] W
[normal]aterhouse, went to the Jersey Financial Services Commission and said, “We want LLPs”.  They forced legislation through in Jersey
[normal], and 
[normal]then they came to the UK and said, “If you do not give us LLPs here, we will all disappear to Jersey”, and the Government fell for that—first, the last Conservative Government, then finally the 
[normal]n
[normal]ew Labour Government.  
[normal]This is a way to complicate the tax system.  You create a fundamental change like that without thinking through the consequences at all.  You surrender to those vested interests and you end up with a whole world of tax avoidance opportunity
[normal],
[normal] and when you try to correct that 15
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]years on you end up with a hugely complex tax system.  There is a certain irony in the fact that this was all forced through by Price
[normal] W
[normal]aterhouse while John
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Whiting was a partner of Price
[normal] W
[normal]aterhouse.  He is now running the Office of Tax Simplification clearing up the mess, so we have really come full circle.  This is an object lesson in how to mess up the tax system.  
[normal]Richard Murphy:[bold] Can I just come back on that point?  In fact, it is quite important to note that it was estimated to cost PricewaterhouseCoopers
[normal]—
[normal]Ernst
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&amp;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Young were involved at the time as well
[normal]—
[normal]about £1
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million to create the 
[normal]Jersey
[normal] legislation.  I recently made an 
[normal]inquiry
[normal] in 
[normal]Jersey
[normal] as to whether the legislation had ever been used there to incorporate an LLP.  It has never been used to create an LLP.  It was a pure exercise in putting pressure on the UK
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Government.
[normal]Q34 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Lord Wakeham:[bold] It is very interesting.  You probably heard me ask this of the people before.  When I was in the Government, it was some years before they did it
[normal]. T
[normal]he pressure was about limiting liability, because they were worried, as you rightly said.  When the LLPs were introduced in 2000, there were some who pointed out the avoidance possibilities of the legislation and some of the people who were sitting there said so.  Why do you think the Government of the day went ahead with it anyway without addressing those risks?  
[normal]Richard Brooks:[bold] They did what vested interest told them to do.  This is why picking on limited liability partnerships is a really good case study to put next to your wider question about how you develop tax policy.  It is an exemplar of where, if you surrender to what people with deep pockets want, you end up with some terrible consequences.  I have done a lot of research on the use of limited liability partnerships, which goes slightly beyond tax.  You mentioned that people pointed out 
[normal]that 
[normal]there were avoidance opportunities already.  If you go back to the 1980s with limited companies, you had things called nowhere companies, which were not tax-resident in any country for tax purposes.  They were incorporated in the 
[normal]UK
[normal], but they were managed abroad, so you could say 
[normal]that 
[normal]under a 
[normal]UK
[normal] test they were not tax
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]resident, and under another country’s test they were not tax resident; they were nowhere.  That is what you created.  By creating a tax transparent system for limited liability partnerships you created that for limited liability partnerships.  That “nowhere” nature, that absence of any location for tax purposes, is what is behind the use of limited liabilities on an absolutely enormous scale for financial crime.  
[normal]I did a report for 
[normal]Private Eye 
[normal]called “
[normal]Where there’s muck
[normal],
[normal] there’s brass plates
[normal]”,
[normal] 
[normal]which looked
[normal] at shell companies
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]We
[normal] found that the corporate vehicle of choice for money launderers now is the limited liability partnership.  To give you an example, if I can, at the mom
[normal]ent
[normal] there are over 2,100
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]limited liability partnerships whose members are 
[normal]Seychelles
[normal] shell companies.  There are 1,800
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]limited liability partnerships whose members are 
[normal]Belize
[normal] shell companies—two shell companies in each case.  You sort of know who is behind them; they are 
[normal]e
[normal]astern European criminal networks.  These limited liability partnerships have been behind things like laundering the proceeds of the tax fraud that led to the murder of Sergei
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Magnitsky.  They have laundered the funds from shipping arms to President
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Assad.  They have been behind any number of corrupt 
[normal]g
[normal]overnment contracts in the former 
[normal]Soviet
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Union
[normal].  This is all happening in 
[normal]UK
[normal] shell companies
[normal]: 
[normal]UK
[normal] limited liability partnerships registered in office blocks probably not that far from here. 
[normal]Lord Wakeham:[bold] The more you give that answer, the more you come back to the question I asked: why did the Government, knowing this was going to happen, agree to it in 2000?
[normal]Richard Murphy:[bold] We have to remember what was happeni
[normal]ng in 2000. The 
[normal]environment was very different from what it is now.  First of all, we were at the absolute height of the tax avoidance industry in professional firms.  This was the era when
[normal] 
[normal]all the prosecutions 
[normal]for 
[normal]tax abuse in the States of the large firms were 
[normal]brought. The 
[normal]sale of structured tax avoidance schemes was very significant, and it was not being noticed on the public radar.  There was simply no attention drawn to this at that time.  There was no movement looking at it.  There was no press interested in it.  The awareness of tax avoidance was very low and it simply slipped below the radar.  The one thing that I remember 
[normal]from 
[normal]2000, which everybody was aware of, was 
[normal]being able to 
[normal]create 
[normal]a 
[normal]non
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]resident organisation apparently trading in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] with a 
[normal]UK
[normal] trading presence but no residents and no tax.  Otherwise, I do not think the issue was seriously discussed.  
[normal]Lord Bilimoria:[bold] Can I just ask both of you, based on Mr
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Brooks’ comment, about the fact that when this was created it created huge amounts of extra legislation and extra rules to an already over
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]complicated and over
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]burdened tax rule book and system?  Surely with the Finance Bill now and what it is suggesting 
[normal]with regard to 
[normal]the tax policy, an already overburdened tax system 
[normal]will be made 
[normal]even more so, especially with a self
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]assessment regime and with the Office of Tax Simplification almost seeming an oxymoron.
[normal]Richard Murphy:[bold] Yes.  What is clearly not being thought about here, and 
[normal]this 
[normal]relates very much to the second part of the question, is an overall policy direction with regard to this.  This legislation creates some complete anomalies in 
[normal]UK
[normal] tax law.  For example, you can have now two individuals form their own separate limited companies—single member companies—and then go into joint venture with each other through an LLP
[normal]. B
[normal]oth those single companies will be looked through for tax purposes and will be charged to income tax.  In other words, the entire corporate structure of limited liability can be ignored and income tax will be paid.  Yet if they formed a company together, they could then be taxed to corporation tax, pay out the entire reward of the whole structure as dividends, pay no PAYE or 
[normal]national insurance
[normal] and 
[normal]probably 
[normal]nobody would ask a question, because IR35 has, frankly, little impact for most companies and is subject to relatively few inquiries.  The Revenue simply does not have the staff to ask.  We create a completely anomalous position by this where we have a failure of horizontal equity within the tax system.  
[normal]W
[normal]e need to go back and ask the real question, which is: how should small businesses be taxed?  
[normal]I hear
[normal]d
[normal] the previous panellists say that they could see no reason 
[normal]for having 
[normal]differences in approach for large and small businesses.  I have to admit 
[normal]that 
[normal]I simply do not agree.  Small businesses are very, very different entities from large partnerships and large corporate entities, and would clearly need a different approach.  This new legislation will create real burdens for consideration by many smaller partnerships, which are probably unnecessary.  If you look at the data from John
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Whiting’s report, you will see that the vast majority of LLPs have three or fewer members.  They are either the sort that should be subject to review because they involve corporate members of the type Richard is describing or, frankly, they are genuine trading partnerships, in which case they should drop out of consideration.  
[normal]The big issue, though, is always to look at the number that are dissolved each year.  That is the most interesting information.  At least 50% of the number registered each year are dissolved.  They never normally submit their tax returns or accounts, and that is where the fraud is going on in particular.  
[normal]Q35 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Baroness Blackstone:[bold] Turning to the draft legislation and what it says about salaried members, the changes that are proposed in the draft Bill are not going to rely on general partnership law to determine whether a member of an LLP is a partner or an employee for tax purposes.  Indeed, they are going to introduce some rather detailed and mechanical tests.  Would it not have been simpler and probably more coherent to have extended the general partnership law rules to LLPs, and why do you think the Government chose not to? 
[normal]Richard Brooks:[bold] As I explained earlier, I have not looked at the details of these new laws greatly, but the simplest thing to do would have been not to have introduced limited liability partnerships in the first place.  This really does show that if you do not think about what you are doing adequately to start with, you end up with this mess years, even decades, on.  I thought it was interesting that Chris
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Sanger earlier on 
[normal]alluded
[normal] to this when he talked about the importance of consulting on the details as legislation is being developed.  That is all very well, but you have to consult the right people.  You have to consult the people who will make these difficult points, who will argue with you.  There is a danger that the consultation that people like Chris
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Sanger thinks is working really well is working really well within their own club, but nobody else is allowed in that club.  There is an example of that in the controlled foreign companies laws.  Mr
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Sanger said that the consultation on that had worked really well.  In fact, in this Finance Bill they have already had to come back and tighten it up because they did not listen to people who were saying, “Hang on, these controlled foreign companies laws you are bringing in are a major threat to the 
[normal]UK
[normal] tax base”.  
[normal]I am sorry to slightly digress from your specific point about partnerships
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]maybe 
[normal]we can get back to that when you talk generally about the consultation process, but it just proves, as you see
[normal], that there are 
[normal]all these difficulties
[normal], and 
[normal]you are now asking, “What would be the best way of correcting this 
[normal]very difficult mess we are in?”
[normal].
[normal] Obviously, you should not really have got into it in the first place.  
[normal]Richard Murphy:[bold] I do not understand a lot about the new rules.  They are clearly written for a very limited number of partnerships.  Let us just look at a couple of examples as to why that is the case.  I was a member of a three
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]partner firm of accountants for many years.  We were not an LLP in those days.  We had very occasionally minuted partners’ meetings, but we had a partners’ meeting every day.  We normally walked off and bought a sandwich together at lunchtime and resolved the issues of the day during the course of going to buy a sandwich and coming back again.  Now, of course we were all active.  Could we prove it under the test that is currently being requested?  I am not sure we would, in that sense, very easily pass.  
[normal]The rules being put forward with regard to capital requirements seem to me to be based upon another era of business.  The number of businesses that require, in small partnerships, a partner to contribute a quarter of their expected annual earnings in capital is tiny.  My LLP does not require that; it clearly does not.  I am a knowledge
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]based business.  I do not need to put in a quarter of my annual income to fund the purchase of a few Apple Macs
[normal]:
[normal] one here, one at home and another in my pocket and that is it.  How much capital d
[normal]o I really need?  Very little.
[normal]The ideas are pretty poorly structured inside the new legislation, so to say that they are importing and creating new ideas that do not really work is absolutely true.  We are creating new tests that are inappropriate.  We should be looking at the fundamental badges of trade and, frankly, most of these partnerships, with regard to these artificial members, would fail the fundamental badges of whether these people are in trade or not that come up under existing Revenue approaches; or, under the settlements legislation, whether an artificial member 
[normal]is 
[normal]included, frankly, because they are a spouse of the main partner, which is an issue that is not discussed.  
[normal]Baroness Blackstone:[bold] Do you think the proposed measures go far enough in blocking the opportunity to disguise employment income as self
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]employed profit? 
[normal]Richard Murphy:[bold] In terms of tackling the large partnerships, they are probably going to be reasonably, but not wholly, effective.  It is not beyond the wit of most lawyers to rewrite their partnership agreements and come up with structures that will suggest that everybody has a participation role in the management of the partnership to get round these rules.  I suspect that is what is going on feverishly in a great many offices around the City right now, to be honest.  There may well be some arrangements being put in place for people to be contributing extra capital to their firm from junior partners, with some interesting loan arrangements to structure them, according to some of the, again, legal press.  So there will be thoughts going on about how to get round the new rules, inevitably, but rather 
[normal]as Richard commented 
[normal]it is the wrong question.  We have a massive problem with regard to PAYE and 
[normal]national insurance
[normal] abuse, which is the hundreds of thousands of small firms that are not paying any and yet the issue that is being picked on is the relatively small number of partnerships that are doing the same thing.  Will it amount to the same level of abuse?  I do not know.  I do not think it has been quantified sufficiently well, but the bigger problem is not being addressed.  
[normal]Q36 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Baroness Wheatcroft:[bold] I would like to explore an area that seems like another unnecessary complication in some ways
[normal]:
[normal] the issue of mixed membership partnerships and when should profit go to the corporate partner.  What is the intention behind that, and are you confident the changes being proposed are an improvement?
[normal]Richard Brooks:[bold] That is not really something 
[normal]that 
[normal]I have looked at, I am afraid.  
[normal]Richard Murphy:[bold] I first came across mixed partnerships very early after LLPs were introduced.  The first one I came across was another chartered accountant, who told me he had created a mixed partnership because, he said, “It is anomalous”.  Companies can have one member, but an LLP has to have two, so he had formed a company, which he owned, to be his own partner, so 
[normal]that 
[normal]he could have LLP status.  That is quite common, by the way.  I think that is done frequently, and the corporate member in those cases is a mere nominee getting £1 a year or whatever—peppercorn.  I certainly think that was common in the first place, but then it became obvious to some people that they could shelter income in this way.  
[normal]One of the previous witnesses said you surely should not be allowed to mix and match.  You either choose to be a corporate entity and therefore 
[normal]to 
[normal]be able to shield your retained profits from tax, or you should choose the advantages of an LLP and accept the consequences of the structure.  What has quite clearly happened is that a number of lawyers and accountants have decided to do that mixing and matching.  I think that is inappropriate.  A number of anti
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]avoidance measures would have come to me before these ones.  For example, requiring the withholding of tax at source on payment of profits to a corporate entity would be an obvious exercise to overcome the problems that Richard is addressing in some of the points he is making.  That would have helped no end and increased tax yield.  The other one would be to say, “No, you cannot have a corporate entity as a member and most certainly you cannot have a corporate entity not tax-resident in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] as a member”, but that is the problem we have.  
[normal]Baroness Wheatcroft:[bold] Do you think that the changes now being proposed will make it less attractive to have a corporate entity as a member?
[normal]Richard Murphy:[bold] Yes, clearly it will make it less attractive.  Will there be some use that will be found for corporate members still?  I am sure there will be, because we are talking about commonalties of ownership, and there will be arrangements that people will find to get around that.  I am sure some trust structures will be put in between the members of the LLP and the corporate entity to overcome the problem at some point, which have not been anticipated so far.  However, the most absurd of the new rules that we have is that this new rule with regard to corporate members does not apply to an LLP trading in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] incorporated outside the 
[normal]UK
[normal].  That, to me, is completely baffling.  Why does it only apply to UK LLPs?  Why is it not applied to LLPs incorporated in Cayman or BVI or wherever else?  I just do not understand that.  
[normal]Baroness Wheatcroft:[bold] It sounds as if you are saying in the interests of tax simplification—an issue for Mr
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Whiting maybe in the future—we should just stop having corporate members.  
[normal]Richard Murphy:[bold] Yes
[normal].  
[normal]Richard Brooks:[bold] You will upset a certain former Prime Minister.
[normal]Q37 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Lord Leigh of Hurley:[bold] 
[normal]The question about the structure of whether or not it is an employee or a partner and the detail of that is the right question, but I think you are the wrong people to ask.  
[normal]The right question to ask you is about the LLP global situation, rather than the detail.  If we had not had LLP legislation in the 
[normal]UK
[normal], d
[normal]o you not think that
[normal] people would have gone offshore, because 
[normal]LLP
[normal] legislation is in many jurisdictions outside the 
[normal]UK
[normal]?  Y
[normal]ou
[normal]r
[normal] suggest
[normal]ion that
[normal] we just do not have 
[normal]LLP legislation, which
[normal] 
[normal]is essentially what I think you are saying, would not be advantageous to the UK economy at all, would it?
[normal]Richard Brooks:[bold] You can address that through licensing.  Price
[normal] W
[normal]aterhouse, now PricewaterhouseCoopers, 
[normal]is 
[normal]going to continue with a big accountancy practice in 
[normal]Britain
[normal].  The idea that, “We will go to 
[normal]Jersey
[normal]”
[normal],
[normal] is in many ways an empty threat
[normal],
[normal] and that was the threat, but it is also one that is easily dealt with by the kind of permissions you give them to operate.  That seems to me far preferable to just rolling over.
[normal]Richard Murphy:[bold] As far as I can see, there is no risk from LLP legislation arising from within the EU.  The risk of use of LLP legislation arises from countries outside the EU.  That is important from the point of view of the right to incorporate, which of course is granted under the 
[normal]Maastricht
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]t
[normal]reaty, and the freedom to choose where to incorporate.  Therefore, we could take sanction against LLPs incorporated outside the EU.  We could simply deem them to be corporations, subject therefore to registration in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] as if they are corporate entities, subject to corporate tax, subject to PAYE.  That problem would therefore be closed overnight, except for the fact that Companies
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]House is extremely poor at registering overseas
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]registered limited liability entities trading in the 
[normal]UK
[normal].  The number is tiny.  I cannot believe there are as few as are registered at Companies
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]House, because 
[normal]the number of 
[normal]at their annual reports is very small, and I suspect we have many more overseas LLPs trading here than are recorded even now.  Every single overseas LLP trading here now should be registered, but I suspect it is not.
[normal]Lord Leigh of Hurley:[bold] 
[normal]To be fair to the large firms of accountants, I think there were a number of them where the LLP was based in 
[normal]Switzerland
[normal], and that is how they got through that time in 2000.  However, in terms of the current proposals—
[normal]Richard Murphy:[bold] I think they were 
[normal]V
[normal]ereins, were they not, rather than LLPs, which are slightly different entities; it is the same as foundations are not the same as trusts, etc.
[normal]Lord Leigh of Hurley:[bold] 
[normal]The
[normal]re was
[normal] that as well
[normal], but also LLPs. 
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]n the current proposals, what else would you like to see 
[normal]to stymie tax avoidance and NIC avoidance?  
[normal]You mentioned 
[normal]you would like to see no corporate LLPs.  
[normal]What else would you like to see
[normal] that would increase the tax take, which is really what we are trying to look at here
[normal]?
[normal] 
[normal]Richard Brooks:[bold] I do not know on the tax haven.  One thing you perhaps ought to have is if you are not going to ban corporate members of LLPs, you should at least insist there is a natural person LLP.  At the moment, there is no requirement to have a natural person as a member within an LLP.  I do not know how that affects the tax take, but it certainly affects the use of LLPs as money-laundering vehicles, because you do not even need anybody’s name on Companies
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]House records to set up an LLP.
[normal]Richard Murphy:[bold] I stress the point I made earlier: 
[normal]that 
[normal]for smaller businesses there are always, in a sense, better tax avoidance opportunities available in current 
[normal]UK
[normal] law than setting up an LLP.  You can always avoid more 
[normal]national insurance
[normal] by incorporating at present than you can by forming an LLP, so it is not at that end of the scale that this is the problem.  The problem is very much at the larger end where you have artificial employment.  The Revenue was targeting that.  My concern is that the rules they are putting in place will be too easy to get round, candidly.  You have a one-in-three test to get around it and it is not going to be a substantial hurdle for some people to put in place structures to circumvent these new rules, so I am not sure how much is really going to be raised.
[normal]Lord Leigh of Hurley:[bold] 
[normal]You are talking about what 
[normal]HMRC call the ABC definitions, and you are saying that any of those can be circumvented or 
[normal]all
[normal] those can be circumvented.
[normal]Richard Murphy:[bold] Probably, in time, all of them will be circumvented.  I really do not doubt that if you put in rules of that sort, which are not that complicated, somebody will find a way around them and you only have to get into one category to avoid being considered an employee.  I suspect the one that is going to be easiest to get around is the management participation.  We heard earlier about Ernst
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&amp;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Young having a 500
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]member webcast partnership meeting.  I think those will become common.  
[normal]Q38 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Baroness Drake:[bold] I 
[normal]will, if I may, 
[normal]go to the issue of the G
[normal]overnment’s new approach to tax 
[normal]policy-making, which 
[normal]they are
[normal] committed to following apart from the exceptions of the tax rates themselves, measures to protect tax revenues or where there is a risk of forestalling
[normal]. M
[normal]y first question is: do
[normal] you think the Government have
[normal] invoked this get-out clause too often
[normal],
[normal] when it does not seek to follow the new approach, or have they got it about right? 
[normal]Richard Brooks:[bold] In the areas I have looked at, they have been far too open with one group of people and completely closed to another group.  The prime example is the controlled foreign companies laws
[normal], which
[normal] have been amended in the last three Finance Bills extensively.  That consultation that Chris
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Sanger from Ernst
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&amp;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Young was very pleased with has led to some major relaxations and some major tax reduction opportunities.  They do not count as tax avoidance because they are on the face of the statute.  They have been developed in such close partnership with the companies 
[normal]that 
[normal]stand to benefit from them and the 
[normal]adviser
[normal]s who are going to advise on applying them that there are all kinds of massive opportunities that probably would not have existed if there had been a more open consultation with people who would not benefit from them.  I looked into how these laws would work at some length.  I did a lengthy investigation for 
[normal]Private Eye 
[normal]magazine involving posing as a tax consultant and talking to the big four accountancy firms, 
[normal]which 
[normal]told me that representing a British multinational company I could wipe out my 
[normal]UK
[normal] tax bill using these new CFC laws.  When I put that to HMRC, they would not admit that for weeks until forced to by the evidence, but that was the law.  However, they had, it transpired, informed the big four accountancy firms of that fact.  This had become an entirely undemocratic process in which the effect of the law was being kept from the public, but it was being shared with a circle who now come here and say that consultation is working extremely well.  It is, in their terms, but it is producing all kinds of problems in the tax system.  
[normal]Following that exposure, in the Autumn Statement the Chancellor announced that there would be a tightening up of these laws, so he has had to go back already, and we are back in the same kind of process we were with limited liability partnerships.  The question is not when the Treasury and the Revenue should close shop
[normal]; it 
[normal]is that in general they need to be far more open with everybody, including the people who do not agree with their approach and maybe even their critics, but that is not something they are prepared to do at the moment.  
[normal]Baroness Drake:[bold] So your point is 
[normal]that 
[normal]you think the consultation is operating to give undue
[normal] influence to certain players. 
[normal]Richard Brooks:[bold] Yes, it is an understatement to say that the devil is in the detail with the tax system.  The entire effect of certain tax laws is in the detail, and if that is hammered out in private conversations that the public, media and critics are not privy to, you end up with very one
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]sided tax legislation.  That might be the intention, but it is an intention that the Government and the Treasury ought to be honest about from the start.
[normal]Baroness Drake:[bold] Do you think there are any improvements in taxation legislation flowing from their new approach?  Do you think there are any upsides, any positives
[normal],
[normal] from it?  
[normal]Richard Brooks:[bold] On certain relatively uncontroversial technical matters there probably are.  I am prepared to believe the people who say that this process is working on that level.  However, it is a very high price to pay if you are giving one group, one set of vested interests
[normal],
[normal] their own way.
[normal]Richard Murphy:[bold] I forgot to look it up before I came
[normal],
[normal] and I apologise for that, but it occurred to me on the way here that I did some research, which I think was published in about 2008.  We looked at several years’ Finance Acts to see how much of legislation was straightforward anti
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]avoidance legislation, and at least 40% could fall into that category, where the Government would 
[normal]probably 
[normal]need to have used the opt
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]out to ensure that revenue was protected.  That was the purpose of the legislation.  Therefore, I would personally expect this opt
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]out to be used quite often, simply because it is necessary because quite a large part of legislation is created for that reason.  Of course, I would argue
[normal],
[normal] and I have argued it here before
[normal],
[normal] that if we had a proper general anti
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]avoidance principle, not a general anti
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]abuse rule, we may get round some of those problems, but that is probably not the purpose of this afternoon.  
[normal]Looking at the process of consultation, I have been involved in a number of ways.  I quite often find that I am the only person submi
[normal]tting to a consultation to HMRC, which
[normal] frankly does not come from a very large organisation
[normal],
[normal] and you will find that that is commonplace.  There will be a long list of the usual big firms of accountants, banks, lawyers and then Tax
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Research
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]LLP, which for these purposes, by and large, is represented by me.  That is the way it works.  The consultation process is still restricted to a tiny number of people.  
[normal]That was also evident when I was involved with the general anti
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]abuse rule, where I sat on the consultation committee.  What was quite surprising was the very limited range of people from whom that consultation was drawn
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]the fact 
[normal]that those who were working for the Revenue on that consultation were at least 50% secondees from the same type of organisation that was making the submission.  We therefore have tax policy being created by a tiny number of organisations and inside the Treasury
[normal] and 
[normal]the Revenue
[normal],
[normal] and the consultation respondents all seem to be the same type of people.  
[normal]Baroness Drake:[bold] So you are basically saying
[normal] that 
[normal]given the importance of tax avoidance legislation, you would expect the get out clause to be used quite often.
[normal]Richard Murphy:[bold] I would expect it to be used quite often, yes, but we need to think much more radically about how we are going to deal with the creation of tax policy.  
[normal]Q39 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Baroness Drake:[bold] Taking the package 
[normal]for 
[normal]partnership taxation, which we are looking at, how effective or efficient do you think the new approach has been in coming up with that package?  Maybe 
[normal]you could outline 
[normal]some strengths and weaknesses in what the process has produced. 
[normal]Richard Murphy:[bold] Richard has said we should never have started with LLPs.  If we were going to start 
[normal]with 
[normal]this consultation, I would be surprised if most people would have expected 
[normal]us to 
[normal]have reached the point we have.  The new rules are surprising.  They do not reflect the reality of what goes on inside most LLPs.  They are quite artificial in terms of the tests that are being applied
[normal], so t
[normal]hey will be open to abuse.  I think Professor
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Freedman was accurate in saying that the people who might be involved in creating some of this draft legislation and the processes inside the Treasury do not have the experience for what happens inside the commercial world, and I do not think they reflect that.  For very many small LLPs, frankly, the best thing the Revenue could have done was 
[normal]to say that 
[normal]there has to be a cut
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]off point where we are looking at something different.  That is a very important point.  If you look at the whole process of consultation, even the whole approach inside the Revenue and the Treasury, there is a relatively widespread understanding of what happens in big business and big partnerships, because they are the people who are being consulted and they are even on the board of HMRC.  There is no small practitioner on the board of HMRC
[normal]; 
[normal]only large firms 
[normal]are 
[normal]represented.  
[normal]N
[normal]o small business 
[normal]is 
[normal]represented; only large business is represented.  
[normal]There are very few 
[normal]consultation responses, because they do not have the resources or the funding to do it
[normal]. They are very often 
[normal]not aware of it.  That is giving rise to a significant bias that is imposing burdens on small businesses where, frankly, we need to start again and say, “What structures would work?”
[normal].
[normal]  If I was to look at this, I would say
[normal] that
[normal] it is time to go back
[normal] and 
[normal]look at the whole structure of small companies and differentiate those from large companies; they are not the same beast.  To pretend that BP is the same as the one
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]person limited liability company, or even a large limited company
[normal], is absurd
[normal].  To pretend that all partnerships are the same is absurd.  We are trying to come up with solutions that are simply answering the wrong questions at the moment, and that is partly because of a failure of the consultation process to involve the right people.  There are good people out there who should be consulted.  I can think immediately of Rebecca
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Benneyworth, who is the Chair of the ICAEW’s Tax Faculty at the moment, an excellent small practitioner and a tax lecturer who clearly knows her material.  We do not agree on everything but I think she would be great, but she is not involved in these processes and she should be.  There is a failure there to ask the right people the right questions and, as a result, we get the wrong answers, and that is shown time and again in the consultation process.  
[normal]Baroness Drake:[bold] What do you say are the top two weaknesses in this partnership taxation package that have come as a result of this approach, if you had to nominate two
[normal]—j
[normal]ust to pin you down to what you think are the two key ones
[normal]?
[normal]Richard Murphy:[bold] I would support Richard’s view that we need to have an identifiable 
[normal]UK
[normal] human being who is a member of a partnership.  Even in the Isle of Man they now require there to be an identifiable person to be a member of a company in the 
[normal]Isle of Man
[normal], because they realise the problems of not having somebody they can contact locally to nail down responsibility for management of an entity.  Yet we do not have that in UK LLP law, which does seem to be quite extraordinary.  I do not often praise the 
[normal]Isle of Man
[normal], but I will on this issue.  Secondly, the question should arise: why are we allowing corporate members?  We are trying to deal with it by tackling an abuse when we should be saying, “You should not be there”.  
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Going back to your point about the number of organisations and firms that are consulted in consultation processes, you are almost suggesting that there is a bit of a closed shop there.  To what extent is it because the vast majority of smaller individuals—smaller in the sense of very small businesses and so on—just simply lack the time, the resources or the expertise to make a real contribution?  
[normal]Richard Murphy:[bold] The expertise does exist in some firms.  It clearly does not in all, but it most certainly does in some.  There are some very good smaller practices in the 
[normal]UK
[normal].  The problem is that there is a closed shop, because the people who have a real impact on the consultation process are not those who make the written submissions; they are those who will turn up and have the face-to-face meetings in the Treasury, and very few smaller firms will be invited in to do that, I suspect.  
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Do they make written submissions? 
[normal]Richard Murphy:[bold] No, because in my experience, frankly, you can write in as many written submissions as you like, and I sometimes feel it is necessary to do so, but I am not sure they are listened to, and I suspect many firms would feel the same way.  You can make submissions and you do not see any consequence of the submission process.  Again, one of the previous witnesses was 
[normal]asking 
[normal]what the outcome of the process
[normal] was.
[normal]  It is very hard to see what happens as a result of the consultation, and I think that is a difficulty.  There is not enough recognition that those who are making submissions have been listened to
[normal],
[normal] and therefore the reward for effort expended is very low, apart from the fact that you are not being paid to do it in most cases, so these firms do not bother.  
[normal]We need to invest a lot more heavily in this country in taxation policy.  It is fundamental to the way we run our economy.  It is fundamental to the way in which small business operates
[normal],
[normal] and yet the Revenue 
[normal]is not willing to go out among
[normal] the smaller business practitioners and ask them, “What do you know?  How do you want policy to be put forward?”
[normal].
[normal]  There are responsible people who would take part in that, but it would require funding.  They cannot all afford to do it for free.  
[normal]M
[normal]oney 
[normal]needs to be 
[normal]put forward to do that, and I cannot see why not.  In the States, this sort of research is well funded by the Senate and the House.  Here there is no money available to advise on it.  Why not?  
[normal]Q40 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Lord Rowe[bold]&#x2011;[bold]Beddoe:[bold] The question that I have to ask has been comprehensively covered by both Mr
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Murphy and 
[normal]Mr
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Brooks
[normal], so I would just like to make a general comment about consultation.  This Committee produced a report in 2011, and our excellent advisers have reminded us of what was said.  When I look at it, listen to what you are saying and read the recommendations that this report made, I just want the small businesses of this country, 
[normal]which
[normal] feel that they are not being consulted
[normal],
[normal] to feel that they are not alone, because these recommendations that were made by this Committee I do not think have been taken into account by anybody.
[normal]Richard Brooks:[bold] You can look at lists of organisations 
[normal]that 
[normal]meet Ministers
[normal] and see who 
[normal]meets the Chancellor and who meets the Exchequer Secretary, David
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Gauke.  I just printed out the quarter leading up to the 2013 Budget, which is the most recent and relevant one available.  The list of organisations he is meeting is dominated by the accountancy bodies
[normal],
[normal] and at the top of their list are the big corporate tax changes.  That is where the money is.  There is one meeting, in February 2013, with the Federation of Small Businesses, but that is it—one meeting.  That is the same as Amazon alone had.  You will find a similar pattern if you look at the meetings of senior officials in the Treasury.  It is completely distorted, and of course there are no campaigners on tax; there are no 
[normal]non
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]governmental organisations that 
[normal]have done a lot of work on tax and take alternative views.  They simply do not feature.  The Treasury and the Revenue do not want to know them.  
[normal]I mentioned an investigation I did into the effect of the new controlled foreign companies laws a few moments ago.  I found out a huge amount there about how those laws were being applied
[normal]. 
[normal]I asked to meet the Revenue to talk about them and they refused.  They simply will not meet critics.  You may recall that episode that was shown on 
[normal]“
[normal]Panorama
[normal]”
[normal] where one of the Government’s advisers on avoidance talked about the Chancellor’s “grubby mitts”.  I filmed that at that training course.  On those training courses I picked up a huge amount of intelligence on corporate and personal tax planning ideas.  I have bumf that big to give the Revenue if they want it.  They will not meet to discuss those issues.  They will happily take copies of the paper, but they will not meet to discuss tax avoidance with a critic.  That is how closed it has become and they are seriously shooting themselves in the foot.  That is why we end up with 
[normal]the 
[normal]flawed legislation 
[normal]that 
[normal]we have in the shape of the co
[normal]ntrolled foreign companies laws, which 
[normal]they will have to come back to again and again to shore up the tax base because they will not listen to people who from the outset will say, “That is not going to work because of A, B and C, and here is evidence”.  They drastically need to open up.
[normal]Lord Rowe[bold]&#x2011;[bold]Beddoe:[bold] To be very specific, 
[normal]then, 
[normal]we recommend
[normal]ed
[normal] strongly that HMRC and the Treasury find more effective ways of consulting smaller businesses and non
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]business stakeholders.  Have you seen any change?
[normal]Richard Murphy:[bold] No.  
[normal]Richard Brooks:[bold] No.  You need a cultural change at the top of these organisations, so that the people they want to meet and the people they want to talk to are not just the captains of industry and the partners in the big accountancy firms.  They need to see their priorities differently.
[normal]Richard Murphy:[bold] Can I go back to the point that HMRC’s board deliberately represent
[normal]s
[normal] big business community—the non
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]executives?  They are not the only taxpayers in this country.  They are important, but they are by no means the only important grouping, and so other people 
[normal]need to be 
[normal]represented there.  However, when that body is exclusive, everything else that flows from the top down 
[normal]suggests, “They are
[normal] the people who matter.  Do not talk to anybody else”
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] You have made your point and it is an issue 
[normal]that 
[normal]we will take up when they come in front of us.  We are coming to the last area now. 
[normal]Q41 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Lord Bilimoria:[bold] We have been talking about consultation.  What about the Government’s commitment to evaluating the effectiveness of tax reforms to ensure that they are meeting their objectives?  In your view, how rigorously have HMRC and the Treasury met this commitment in respect of tax legislation introduced since 2010 and what could be done to improve their monitoring and evaluation arrangements? 
[normal]Richard Murphy:[bold] I wish I could tell you what their objectives were
[normal] 
[normal]in most cases
[normal].  Let me give you one simple example.  The Prime Minister last year was very keen to say that he was going to tackle offshore tax abuse whil
[normal]e
[normal] at the same time moving the 
[normal]UK
[normal] from a residence
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]based corporation tax to a territorial
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]based corporation tax, which substantially increased the opportunities for offshore tax abuse by 
[normal]UK
[normal] companies.  The two moves were quite clearly in conflict one with the other.  How, as a consequence, can anybody undertake a review of outcome against objectives when it was not clear what 
[normal]g
[normal]overnment policy was in this area?  Were they trying to encourage businesses to move profits offshore or were they trying to encourage businesses to move profits onshore?  It just was not apparent.  Legislation said one thing
[normal], 
[normal]policy statement said another.  Until they are clear about what they are trying to achieve and speak with one consistent tone, an evaluation process is always going to be a failure
[normal],
[normal] and I have seen no evidence that that evaluation process is therefore taking place in any effective way at all.
[normal]Richard Brooks:[bold] I agree completely with Richard.  There are public objectives and private objectives and sometimes they differ greatly, particularly in the area of international corporate tax, so it become
[normal]s
[normal] very difficult to judge their performance on that, but it is all tied in with the consultation process.  That gap between what they are really trying to do and what they say they are trying to do would not be so wide if the whole process was opened up and people who do not agree with them necessarily, people who they find a bit uncomfortable, were allowed to come and discuss and analyse their proposals, rather than them being kept within this closed shop of officials, Ministers and big accountancy firms, lawyers and big corporations.  If you opened that up, you close that gap and then we can judge whether they are performing much better.  
[normal]Lord Bilimoria:[bold] Are you saying that you have not even seen one good example of post
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]implementation review?
[normal]Richard Brooks:[bold] I have not looked closely enough.
[normal]Richard Murphy:[bold] My answer is no, I cannot think of one.  I am sorry
[normal], 
[normal]I cannot think of 
[normal]anything 
[normal]I have seen that really gives me confidence that there is an effective process going on, no.  If it is going to go on, it has to be done independently.  It has to be financed and undertaken by people who are outside the Treasury and HMRC.  It has to be a proper process to appraise this.  It cannot be done by an internal process, because then the pressure to confirm that what you found is consistent with what was expected is too high.  You have to have the ability to criticise with freedom.  It is like the internal auditor role.  If the internal auditor reports to the managing director, you cannot achieve the role.  They have to report to an audit committee.  It has to be outside the system.  At the moment it is not and therefore the process cannot work.  The right governance procedures are not in place.
[normal]Q42 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Lord Bilimoria:[bold] 
[normal]Li
[normal]nked to this, part of any process and monitoring of tax rules is spotting quickly whether ways have been found to circumvent them or abuse them.  How effectively do you think HMRC performs this task?  
[normal]Richard Murphy:[bold] I think Richard has answered that.  
[normal]Richard Brooks:[bold] There are examples of where they have done a pretty good job of spotting the abuse of tax laws.  A lot of work has been done in recent years on avoidance schemes using partnerships, things like the film investment schemes that were up to no good.  They did some pretty good work there, but it is 
[normal]a matter of 
[normal]cleaning up after the event a lot of the time.  Their appetite for doing that varies according to the taxpayer who is involved.  Where the highest profile person you have is a comedian using a type of tax structure, they are pretty keen to get on to that and get their success out there, which is fair enough.  However, when it is in other areas, 
[normal]such as 
[normal]a big multinational exploiting some tax rules for tax avoidance or a very powerful non
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]domiciled individual, they are less keen on spotting the abuse and clamping down.  
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Gentlemen, I think we are beginning to become a bit repetitive with the same points.  We have had a very long session, but you have certainly made your points on these latter things to us very clearly.  Can I thank you again, as you have done before, for coming and giving us evidence?  Thank you. 
[normal] 
[normal]
