[[[Road Safety GB – Written evidence]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;Thank you for your request for the views of Road Safety GB on the proposed lifting  of the requirement to notify the Secretary of State before a pedestrian crossing is removed.&#xa0;Our view is that, provided that stakeholder and local consultation continues to be a requirement, this proposal will have no negative effect on road safety. It will be one less administrative task for all concerned, that has no safety benefit, which we welcome.&#xa0;Yours,Honor ByfordVice ChairRoad Safety GB&#xa0;&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
