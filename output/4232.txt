[[[About the Local Government ]]]

[[[Association]]]&#xa0;The Local Government Association (LGA) is the national voice of local government.  We work with councils to support, promote and improve local government.&#xa0;We are a politically-led, cross party organisation which works on behalf of councils to ensure local government has a strong, credible voice with national government.  We aim to influence and set the political agenda on the issues that matter to councils so they are able to deliver local solutions to national problems.&#xa0;The LGA covers every part of England and Wales, supporting local government as the most efficient and accountable part of the public sector.&#xa0;

[[[Q: ]]]

[[[What is the rationale for the Government’s proposals to devolve to a]]]

[[[ local level decision-making on transport expenditure? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Government’s approach? Are there better models?]]]&#xa0;The LGA does not accept that there has been a genuine devolution of decision making on transport to a local level.&#xa0;The LGA was pleased to see the Government explicitly acknowledging that "local authorities have a crucial role to play in supporting housing and wider economic growth", during the June 2013 Spending Round. The Government’s comments were prompted by Lord Heseltine’s report on local growth, which called for Whitehall departments to devolve more of their funding because local partners know better how to invest these funds to best effect, a position that the LGA has long advocated.&#xa0;The LGA accepts this has been accompanied by moves to put more levers and funding related to growth into local hands, including the Local Growth Fund, the partial retention of business rates, devolution of the majority of EU structural and investment funds to LEPs and the extension of the city deal model to all LEPs as ‘growth deals'. There are also encouraging signs that the Highways Agency is willing to work with local partners, although it remains to be seen how this will work in practice as its route based strategies develop. Councils and other local partners are keen to co-produce plans and shape the decisions on the £15 billion spend identified for the Strategic Roads Network (SRN), which will have major impacts on local growth. It is not enough for councils to be just consulted on plans after they have been developed. &#xa0;However, we believe that 

[[[significant hurdles remain in ]]]

[[[place, hindering ]]]

[[[the ability of local partners to ma]]]

[[[ximise th]]]

[[[eir drive for economic growth.]]] Whitehall departments remain resistant to joining up their efforts and releasing control to a local level.  &#xa0;Rather than pooling and localising funds through a single pot, as the Heseltine Review recommended, a £2 billion a year “Local Growth Fund” has been created, drawing primarily on council, or already-devolved, funding.  The local growth fund requires councils to engage, through LEPs, in a competitive bidding process with entries being judged by Whitehall. 

[[[This]]]

[[[ is not devolution and is a long way from Lord Heseltine’s vision.]]]&#xa0;In addition to this dilution of the fundamental principle of devolution, the Government has now indicated that it intends to attach conditions to highways maintenance funding. As this money makes up a greater portion of the capital transport funding councils receive from central government than previously, the effect will be to reduce the ability of councils to decide for themselves how transport funding should be spent.&#xa0;The Government’s approach has caused unnecessary complications, with funding that was already announced for delivery by Local Transport Boards now to be handed over to LEPs with an allocation process different from other streams within the fund. This has given rise to several concerns:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Overall, the Government has taken a distorted approach to funding. Whitehall boasts of the £15bn it plans to spend on the 2% of the network controlled by Highways Agency (carrying a third of all traffic) by 2021, while offering £13bn to maintain and improve the other 98% over the same period (which carries two thirds of all traffic).&#xa0;Finally, transport spending is not simply about capital projects. The elements that make up an areas transport network do not exist in isolation from one another. Unless councils are in a position to take a holistic view of transport, integrating transport policy into policies on growth, housing, health and education, devolved decision making is not possible. For all the Government’s talk of localism, 

[[[measures to devolve power to councils in respect of traffic management, bus services and rail franchising have amounted to very little in practi]]]

[[[ce.]]]&#xa0;It is our view that it is only possible to achieve best value from investment in spending where transport can be seen as a whole and transport policy integrated with other policies. Transport is not an end in itself and its component modes do not exist in isolation from one another. At the local level, only councils are in a position to deliver this holistic approach and the chief disadvantage of the Government’s approach is that it leads to a piecemeal siloed transport policy that does not deliver best value.&#xa0;

[[[Q: ]]]

[[[Do local bodies (including local authorities, local enterprise partnerships, passenger transport executives, integrated transport authorities and local transport boards) have the capacity to assess, prioritise and deliver local transport ]]]

[[[schemes? What would the optimum delivery body look like?]]]&#xa0;Councils have shown that they are capable of delivering schemes and working in partnership with LEPs, other councils and other stakeholders, such as the Highway Agency. For example, Cornwall County Council has demonstrated that it could deliver the upgrade to the A30 road for £20 million less than the Highways Agency’s plans, a 25% reduction in costs. Council projects often have a much higher return, with more than a quarter achieving a benefit-to-cost ratio of 5:1, according to the National Audit Office. By contrast, schemes are considered to have ‘high’ value for money by the Department for Transport if they produce £2 of economic benefit for every £1 spent.  &#xa0;Government cuts to local budgets of 43 per cent mean councils have had to make difficult decisions on resourcing delivery, but they are doing so in innovative ways, such as working in partnership and through finding innovative solutions. Further funding cuts would threaten councils’ ability to innovate.  &#xa0;The LGA believes there is no optimum body as one size does not fit all. The purpose and value of devolution is that it recognises and enables the right organisations and solutions to come together to tackle the challenges and take opportunities that are unique to that area. Rather than prescribing a particular body, the LGA would like to see devolution that produces place and needs specific outcomes, enabling councils to take the holistic view of transport outlined above.&#xa0;The Government estimates that 

[[[traffic on the local roads network will increase by 4]]]

[[[1.5 per cent between 2010 and 2040]]]

[[[.]]]

[[[ ]]]This will put impossible stress on the road network in some areas, hampering growth and creating gridlock. The example of London shows that where local government has a wide range of tools it can deliver reductions in traffic levels (a 7.8 per cent fall in car traffic 2003-10). Yet the government refuses to equip councils outside London with similar powers. Unless this changes some of our towns and cities will grind to a halt in the next twenty years.&#xa0;

[[[Q: ]]]

[[[What is the best way of dealing with major transport schemes that cross local authority boundaries or have wider regional impact?]]]&#xa0;Councils are already working together on sub-regional basis, be it through Local Transport Boards, Local Enterprise Partnerships or other local transport bodies.  Councils recognise that major transport schemes often cross boundaries and have shown they can work together on such matters. It should be up to local partners to decide how best they should organise themselves to deal with major schemes that cross their boundaries.&#xa0;In many areas councils are coming together to form alliances to find solutions for major transport improvement schemes. Alliances such as the A14 Alliance and A47 Alliance demonstrate that councils can work together and pool funding to help lever in investment. &#xa0;

[[[Q: ]]]

[[[How effectively do local bodies work with each other and with Government departments and national transport agencies?]]]&#xa0;Councils have consistently identified the Highways Agency and National Rail as barriers to delivering local growth. The Government has followed up its pledge from its command paper, Action for Roads to reform and modernise the Highways Agency by launching a consultation on the 29th October. The Government has stated that it will “support a much greater local and regional stakeholder involvement in planning for the [strategic roads] network and help to inform our investment decisions for the next spending review”.&#xa0;With councils and LEPs now having a clearer mandate on growth, and the Highways Agency undergoing reform, this presents an ideal opportunity for a new level of trust, engagement and partnership-working between local government, LEPs and the Highways Agency. The forthcoming reforms must result in dialogue between the Highways Agency and local government on the wider issue of economic growth, as opposed to the previously narrow focus on just roads.&#xa0;Growth is a key local priority and the SRN makes a vital contribution. This is why route based assessments need to be a genuine coproduction between local authorities and the Highways Agency and need to consider all modes of transport and the local road network.  Councils do not just want to be consulted on HA plans; councils want co-production of plans.  &#xa0;Investment in the SRN needs to be coordinated with the Strategic Economic Plans produced by Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs), as well as existing City Deal agreements. The partnership between the Highways Agency and councils should not be confined to the SRN alone.&#xa0;Given the difficulties local authorities have experienced with Network Rail, councils will want to ensure both that lessons are learned and that account is taken of the crucial difference between rail, where there is a clear ‘end’ to the network, and road where any division between the SRN and local roads is in fact artificial.&#xa0;The SRN should not be considered in isolation from the local roads network or from transport provision as a whole. For instance, roads policy should be considered alongside, and integrated with, rail policy. This reflects an underlying principle running through the LGA’s campaign, Rewiring Public Services which argues for a joined up approach to infrastructure investment.&#xa0;

[[[Q: ]]]

[[[Do the current funding streams for major local transport schemes meet the needs of local authorities? How do current funding streams]]]

[[[ compare with previous arrangements?]]]&#xa0;Current funding arrangements will deliver more money for some councils, who will also benefit from the fact that the Local Growth Fund (LGF) provides a more flexible approach to funding major schemes than was the case previously.  However there has been insufficient devolution of funding and the increased capital budget does not make sufficient provision for highways maintenance.&#xa0;The DfT originally proposed reforming the local majors funding by dividing the fund between Local Transport Boards (LTBs). The LGA had argue for the funding to be devolved to councils who would then make their own partnerships for cross-boundary schemes. The shift from the DfT’s original proposals to LGF was a retrograde step in the sense that it was a return to the idea of centrally judged bidding process.&#xa0;The LGA has been successful in putting its case to the Department for Transport (DfT) to provide more resources for transport to councils. The 2015/16 Spending Round, announced on the 26 June, more than doubled local majors transport scheme funding from £375 million per annum to £819 million per annum. However, as this money has been subsumed into the LGF, this increase will only benefit those councils that are successful in bidding for LGF funds, and we have outlined above a number of concerns over how the LGF works. Notwithstanding these concerns, for those councils whose LGF bids are successful, the exercise offers a potentially significant opportunity to invest in local transport, but this success will be bought in part at the expense of those whose bids are not successful, and the wider success is spread (i.e. the greater the number of centrally approved bids), the less it is worth. Even for those councils who are successful, the cost of bidding is substantial, particularly when local government is suffering 43% cuts (across the lifetime of the current Parliament).&#xa0;The difficult position councils face, especially those not favoured by the judges of LGF bids, is compounded by persistent shortcomings in the roads maintenance funding. The increase in highways maintenance funding in the 2010 Spending Review has, in effect, been achieved by cuts in the Integrated Transport Block (ITB). For councils that receive no funding from the Local Growth Fund, the combined annual ITB and highways maintenance funding will be the same between the period 2015-21 as in 2014-5. Moreover, as the 2013 ALARM survey estimated that current levels of government funding for roads maintenance in England fell short by £829m a year, it is obvious that the ‘increase’ will leave a considerable shortfall going forward and that further deterioration in the network will take place assuming recent levels of severe weather damage continue. It would take ten years to repair the pothole backlog at current funding levels assuming no new ‘wear and tear’ was inflicted on our roads. However, the prospect of a 40 per cent increase in traffic as highlighted earlier suggests maintenance pressures will increase in coming years. &#xa0;Moreover, whilst capital funding has increased, councils are experiencing a rapid squeeze on vital revenue funding which is needed to develop and deliver quality schemes. 

[[[The 43]]]

[[[ funding over the spending review period to 2015/16 will considerably restrict councils ability, not their willingness, to maximise the potential for their areas.]]]

[[[ ]]]Where limited resources could be put to better use to develop high quality, value-for-money schemes, councils have to devote time to reviewing governance arrangement from Local Transport Boards to LEPs, and competitive bidding for funds.&#xa0;Funding from a national perspective appears distorted. The Government boasts of the £15bn it plans to spend on the 2% of the network controlled by Highways Agency (carrying a third of all traffic) by 2021, while offering £13bn to maintain and improve the other 98% over the same period (which carries two thirds of all traffic).&#xa0;

[[[Q: ]]]

[[[What impact will the devolution ]]]

[[[in 2015 of funding to Local Transport Bodies and the introduction of the Single Local Growth Fund have?]]]&#xa0;Councils are working out arrangements for governance and decision-making during the transition. They will find the most efficient and practical ways of dealing with the unnecessary complications that the Government has created which have been highlighted in the response above.&#xa0;

[[[Q: ]]]

[[[How can local authorities attract greater investment from the private sector for the delivery and maintenance of local transp]]]

[[[ort infrastructure? What scope is there for the use of alternative funding streams?]]]&#xa0;Local government is one of the few parts of the public sector that uses its resources to increase growth and productivity, both of which are critical to funding services. Councils need financial autonomy to maximise their assets and invest to support growth and infrastructure.&#xa0;The LGA’s Rewiring Public Services campaign advocates devolving certain tax and spending decisions to the local level, so that public services can be integrated to deliver better results. This would benefit the economy by moving away from top-down solutions that don’t fit everywhere, instead allowing individual areas to play to its strengths. This would result in a more resilient economy overall by making each area stronger instead of accepting that some will always be dependent on others. &#xa0;Such a system would incentivise local growth and investment, which joining up whole place decision-making to deliver more effective, better value services.&#xa0; It could bring together decision making on health, transport, housing, education and emergency services and include closer working with business and the voluntary sector.&#xa0;&#xa0;Devolving in this way would mean breaking away from our busted system of local government finance and allowing local areas to raise funds in ways that make sense in that area, not relying on Council Tax and Business rates. &#xa0;Local people would get the results and local services they care about by giving them power over local taxation and how their taxes are spent.&#xa0;Despite the 43% funding cuts (across the life of the current Parliament) which councils are being forced to endure, local government is still delivering and innovating on major infrastructure projects that will radically transform the economic viability of an area. Major projects such as the Mersey Gateway, will drastically reduce congestion and kick-start a major 20 year regeneration programme. The new bridge is being procured as a Public Private Partnership with over 70 per cent of the cost being funded by the private sector (financed through tolls collected).&#xa0;Wolverhampton and Staffordshire councils jointly funded the development of critical road infrastructure, which involved £36 million of prudential borrowing, which helped give Tata Ltd certainty and confidence in making the investment decision for a £400million investment in a new manufacturing plant for Jaguar Land Rover.&#xa0;The LGA is in discussion with HM Treasury on the re-creation of a thriving market in municipal bonds which England once had and most other countries still have. Such as bond market would free local government borrowing from Treasury restrictions because it already complies with appropriate prudential rules; and allow access to alternative sources of finance, including the creation of a local government bond agency and the right to develop earn-back deals. This would allow places to reinvest the proceeds of additional growth in local services and measures to promote further growth.&#xa0;

[[[Q: ]]]

[[[How clear are the lines of accountability for ]]]

[[[local decision making on transport expenditure?]]]&#xa0;As always, councils have shown that they can work pragmatically to ensure clear lines of accountability on their spending decisions. As mentioned previously, the Government has complicated matters by introducing Local Transport Boards, then then transferring future transport spending decisions to Local Enterprise Partnerships. As LEPs develop in this way, the issue of accountability needs to be considered. Councils are working with LEP partner to identify ways to ensure that there is still democratic accountability within the new system.  &#xa0;Whilst councils welcome the move towards greater devolution of decision-making to the local level, they remain frustrated by the fact that the permanent secretary of the Department for Transport remains accountable to Parliament for local transport investment. Given the spending is to benefit local residents and businesses, the LGA firmly believes that it should be at the local level where the public can hold decision-makers to account.&#xa0;December 20136&#xa0; https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/212474/road-transport-forecasts-2013.pdf Table One and p.7 ‘Box 2: London Scenario. 41.5% is the central case, the range being 23-64.1%.
