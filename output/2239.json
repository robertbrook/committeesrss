"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Christine Ann Wellington [WAS0024]&#xa0;IntroductionThe benefits of regularly participating in sport are known and unequivocal. Heath benefits are both physical (eg cardio-vascular endurance, co-ordination, flexibility, weight management) and psychological (enjoyment, anti-depressant, self-esteem). Transferable skills - time management, organisation, goal setting, \nteamwork\n – are also of considerable value. Sport builds bridges and unites communities. Increasing participation is an investment in the overall economic, cultural and social health of our nation.\nEquity is expected by the public and enshrined in law. It is therefore entirely reasonable to suggest that similar opportunities should exist for women to participate in, succeed at and make a living from sport as they do for men. \nIt must be remembered that ‘women/girls’ is not a homogenous category and consideration must be given to differences in income level, age, ethnicity, place of residence and disability.\n&#xa0;\nThis submission considers the barriers to participation, and makes recommendations for overcoming them, at the grassroots and elite level.  Action requires genuine, transparent and honest collaboration between all stakeholders\n. \nGrassroots Level: Barriers and Recommendations for ActionBarriers to participation at the grassroots can be grouped into: financial, practical, personal/psychological and institutional.  \nOvercoming barriers and stimulating participation requires an understanding of the varied motivational drivers/triggers: \neg\n \nthe factors that influence \nif\n, \nwhy,\n and \nwhen\n females commence and maintain their participation.\n This is captured by the 5’Fs: 1) fun and feel-good factor, 2) fitness, 3) friendship, 4) fundraising and 5) the fight (competition). Taking the barriers and triggers into consideration, below are suggestions for increasing participation at the grassroots level. \nPractical barriers\n&#xa0;\nThese include: limited leisure time (due to work patterns/hours, domestic work, care of child/relatives); lack of access to transport; safety concerns; lack of (access to) quality sports facilities and opportunities; lack of (affordable) childcare facilities; season/climate.  Specific suggestions are as follows:\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n              \n              \nFinancial barriers:\n&#xa0;\nThese include: limited disposable income; rising/high entry fees; long-term membership requirements for gyms and leisure centres; cost of clothing and equipment. \nIf we are to increase participation consideration must be given to a) the actual costs of participation and b) the way we market the sport and our products.\n Suggested actions include:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPersonal/psychological-social\n&#xa0;Personal/psychological-social \nbarriers include: \nlack of confidence and low self esteem/perceptions of ability/body image; perceptions of sport as male-dominated, unfeminine activity; peer pressure; lack of parental support; cultural restrictions; lack of positive role models; \ncompetitive/aggressive/intimidating environments; \nlack of friends/people to participate with. Suggested actions include: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nInstitutional factors\n&#xa0;\nInstitutional barriers include: lack of women in leadership positions such as coaching, management roles at all levels; perception of clubs as cliquey and unwelcoming to new members; lack of ongoing training for teachers in provision of good quality PE at school; lack of equity between sexes of athletes competing in major games, events and races. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCase study: parkrun organises free, weekly 5km run events in over 200 locations throughout the UK. \nparkrun\n is also setting up a 2km junior series for 4-14 year olds. \n \nFemales currently account for \n49.5% of registrations\n. The reasons for this equality lie in parkrun’s model which helps to overcome some barriers to participation. parkruns are: simple to organise; \nfree to the user; there is no need to pre-book or be selected; they are organised by the community for the community; events are held in the open air in natural surroundings; they take place regularly (weekly); they are local and easy to access; they are open to all, inclusive and friendly; there is no dress code; they encourage family involvement; they are timed (offering the opportunity to track progress) and events also organise post-run social gatherings. \nwww.parkrun.org.uk\n \n&#xa0;Elite level sport&#xa0;\nElite level sport fosters national pride, provides sporting role models, provides entertainment, \ncreates\n ‘trickle down’ economic benefits as well as helping to promote grassroots participation\n.\n However, relative to men, women’s sport is overlooked, under-valued and under-capitalised. It is characterised by: fewer race/competition opportunities; lack of media coverage (especially television) and sport/athlete exposure; insufficient commercial investment in (and financial insecurity of) teams, athletes and events; lack of financial support, and proper employment contracts; lack of women in other roles (such as coaches, high level management/governance and sports agents). Some sports, such as cycling are also characterised by: smaller prize purses (compared to men) and discriminatory rules regarding race and stage distances.  \n&#xa0;\nAll of the above factors are interdependent in a vicious circle that perpetuates the undesirable status quo. As a result of the unsupportive framework, female athletes are unable to fulfil their potential. This creates a lack of strength in depth in the female professional ranks in some sports, leading to the misconception that women’s sport is inferior, and is used to justify further inaction. There is a huge and valuable opportunity for all stakeholders to benefit from the full potential of women’s elite sport, with the goal of developing it equitably and sustainably at all levels. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nMedia coverage \n&#xa0;\nSport is sport irrespective of gender. Women’s sport deserves media coverage because it’s an exciting, thrilling, tactical and emotive to watch, not solely because the athletes are female. The Olympics proves this; with 7.6million viewers watching the BBC’s coverage of the women’s Olympic road race for example.  \nDespite the welcome increase in media coverage of women’s sport over the past year – for example: football, cricket, golf - there is room for improvement. The \nsolution is not as simple as asking for more coverage and expecting the media to act. It is a complex situation that requires that all stakeholders work together to ensure progress.  \nWhilst not exhaustive, the following actions could be taken:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nIncluding: governmental departments; NGOs; schools, colleges and universities; gyms and leisure centres and other physical activity providers; international and member federations; event organisers; elite athletes and teams, sports brands and commercial sponsors; the media and the public.\n \nIt is worth noting that elite athletes must be embedded in systematic and ongoing local programmes of promotion, mentoring and support involving parents, teachers and significant adults – as well being effectively and appropriately represented in the media - if they are to be effective role models.\n \nGovernment investment in elite sport should not replace support for activities and programmes that drive participation at the grassroots level, as well as parallel spending on sport through the Departments of Health and Education and Culture, Media and Sport. Of course, the reality is that our elite sport system only prospers when we have a strong talent base on which to draw.\n&#xa0;\n"
