defaultThe EDF considers that access to legal aid is vital to ensure 
defaultthe rule of law in a modern democratic society and the nee
defaultd for fairness to ensure a level playing field for access to justice.
default It appears that the Government, in introducing these proposed provisions, is attempting to ensure that it is out of reach of criticism.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe common law, the European Convention on Human 
defaultRights (ECHR)
default,
default 
defaultthe
defaultEuropean Charter of Fundamental Rights
default defaultand the International Covenant on Civil
defaultand Political Rights
default 
defaultexpressly recognise the right of access to legal aid in complex
defaultlegal proceedings. In the words of the lat
defaulte Lord Bingham:
default 
default&#xa0;
default 
default…
defaultdenial o
defaultf legal protection
default 
defaultto the poor litigant who cannot afford to pay is [the] enemy of the rule of law.
default&#xa0;defaultThe
default UN Committee for the Elimination of Discrimination against Women 
defaulthas been very critical 
defaultof previous restrictions on the availability of legal aid
default 
defaultso 
defaultfurther restrictions 
defaultmay well put the UK 
defaultin breach of 
defaultits
default international obligations.
default&#xa0;defaultPdefaultroposdefaultal todefault introducdefaultedefault a residence test for civil legal aid claimants, so as to ldefaultimit legal aid to those with a ‘defaultstrong cdefaultonnection’default with the UKdefault&#xa0;defaultThe proposal is 
defaultto require
default applicants for civil legal aid to satisfy a residence test in order for civil legal aid to be available.
default This means that the applicant
default 
defaultmust be 
defaultlawfully resident in the UK, Crown Dependencies or British Overseas Territories at the time an application for c
defaultivil legal aid was made
default and 
defaultthe individual would also be required to have resided lawfully in the UK, Crown Dependencies or British Overseas Territories for 12 months
default.
default (An exception will be made for asylum seekers 
defaultwhile their application is being considere
defaultd
default,
default but once asylum has been granted they will have to wait for another 12 months before they are eligible for legal aid).
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe legal aid provider 
defaultwould need to see evidence that the client was lawfully resident and had previously been lawfully resident fo
defaultr 12 months, and they would need to retain copies of this evidence on file for audit purposes. 
defaultThis will put an onerous burden onto legal aid providers whose time is already very constrained to investigate their client’s immigration status as well as havin
defaultg to get proo
defaultf of their length of residence.
default This is a complex and potentially time consuming task. 
default&#xa0;defaultThis proposal 
defaultwill take away access to civil legal aid
default,
default no matter how important the issue at stake. It 
defaultappears to run contrary to a number of the UK’s 
defaultinternational obligations as well as disproportionately disadvantaging non-UK nationals.
default It 
defaultwill exclude
default from access to legal aid
default:
default&#xa0;
defaultThese people will be unable to access legal aid even if the claim concerns domestic violence, the consequences of being trafficked, homelessness or habe
defaultas corpus. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn relation to discrimination law claims
default,
default we 
defaultconsider
default that this provision will be contrary to the provisions in the European Equ
defaultality Directives 
defaultwhich
default say that ‘
defaultMember States shall ensure that judicial and/or administrative procedures, includi
defaultng where they deem it appropriate conciliation procedures, for the enforcement of obligations under this Directive are available to all persons who consider themselves wronged by failure to apply the principle of equal treatment to them
default’
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultAdditionally, w
defaulte 
defaultconsider
default that this provision would be contrary to article 16 
defaultof the Refugee Convention 1951, which states:
default&#xa0;defaultProposal to restrict the availability of legal aid to prisonersdefault&#xa0;defaultThe EDF is concerned about the proposal to 
defaultrestrict the availability
default 
defaultof legal aid to prisoners
default for prison law matters.
default defaultThe proposal is that
default 
defaultprisoners 
defaultwill no longer be 
defaultable to get
default legal aid for
default 
defaultadvice and representation relating to treatment, sentencing
default or
default disciplinary matters
default unless 
defaultth
defaultey involve
default: 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis means that cases 
defaultconcerning the treatment of prisoners including prison conditions (food, access to work, access to services, 
defaultreligious worship)
default;
default assault, including sexual assault by staff
default; discrimination; withholding correspondence;
default barring visitors
default;
default separation of mothers and their babies
default; and
default attendance at behaviour courses
default will 
defaultall 
defaultbe excluded
default. It will 
defaultalso 
defaultexclude legal aid f
defaultor cases concerning categorisation, segregation, resettlement and other sentence issues
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe consider that this will have a significant adverse impact for certain equality groups.
default  
defaultIt is well know
defaultn
default that people from ethnic minorities are over-represe
defaultnted in the prison population. 
defaultOn 31 March 2013, 26% of the prison population, 21,462 prisoners, was from a minority ethnic group.
default This compares to around one in 10 of the general population.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are also a disproportionate number of disabled people i
defaultn prisons compared to the general population.
default defaultThis is harder to estimate
default:
default nevertheless, an estimate
defaultd
default 36% of prisoners interviewed in a Ministry of Justice study were considered to have a disability when answers about disability and health, including mental health, were screened.
default 
defaultEighteen per cent (
default18%
default)
default of prisoners interviewed were considered to have a p
defaulthysical disability
default.
default defaultTwenty to thirty per cent 
defaultof all offenders have learning disabilities or difficulties that interfere with their ability to cope with the criminal justice system
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultc
defaultonsultation paper suggests that
default prisoners can just use the prisone
defaultr
default 
defaultcomplaints mechanism
default as an alternative to legal aid
default. However, under existing rules, prisoners are only eligible for
default 
defaultlegal aid if their case cannot be resolved under the complaints mechanism. 
defaultConsequently the current cases are already ones that have not o
defaultr cannot be resolved by the existing complaints process.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultHer Majesty’s Inspectorate of Prisons 
defaultis critical of
default complaints management,
default 
defaultwhich is slow and ineffective
default. They
default comment
default:
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are concerned by the proposal that criminal legal aid for prison law ma
defaulttters should be restricted to the criteria set out in the consultation paper, and that it is reliant on both an effective complaints system and on reasonable adjustments being made to ensure prisoners with learning difficulties and/or mental health problem
defaults can use the complaint system. Our 
defaultinspection evidence suggests a distinct lack of confidence in the prisoner complaints system, particularly amongst those prisoners reporting as having a disability or a mental health issue. It is our view that prisoners 
defaultwith identified communication, mental health problems and learning difficulties should be able to obtain legal aid on the current basis.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultAdditionally, any legal aid that is made available under these restrictions will have to be delivered 
defaultby provider
defaults 
defaultwith a criminal law contract.
default We do not cons
defaultider that this is appropriate. 
defaultMost 
defaultexisting prison law experts are 
defaultnot criminal practitioners, but individuals and firms who specialize in prison law
default which is 
defaulta niche form of public law.
default&#xa0;
defaultPdefaultroposal that providersdefault of legal services in applications for judicial review against public bodies should only be paid for work done on the case if the Court grants permission for the application to proceeddefault&#xa0;defaultThe EDF strongly disagrees with this proposal as it will weed out the 
defaultstrong
default cases as much as the weak ones;
default it will act as a disincentive to early settlement or resolution of cases and will discourage solicitors from taking any judicial review cases on behalf of individuals 
defaulthowever strong their case
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe EDF considers tha
defaultt Judicial Review is a vital remedy and one of the most important ways for individual people to hold national and local public bodies to 
defaultaccount for acting unlawfully. 
defaultWe note that the Ministry of Justice in its press release for the earlier Consultation o
defaultn Reforming Judicial Review acknowledged 
default‘the important role that Judicial Review plays in holding Government and others to account’.
default The power to judicially review public decisions is an important reserve power enabling citizens to ensure good governance 
defaultand further constraints on its use should be approached with considerable caution.
default&#xa0;
defaultIf this proposal goes ahead, it will create a situation where individuals will not be able to bring cases challenging the decisions of local authorities or central government because they will not be able to find lawyers willing to take the risk of not get
defaultting paid for this work. 
defaultIf, as seems likely, 
defaultlawyers stop doing this type of work people facing injustice because of public law failings by public bodies will find it increasingly difficult to find anyone to advise them.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is neither reasonable nor sens
defaultible to expect individuals to take judicial revie
defaultw action without legal advice. 
defaultLitigants acting without advice are more likely to take cases that will not succeed, whatever their intrinsic merits, because the case has
default not been adequately prepared. 
defaultThey ar
defaulte also more likely to take weak cases which might have been deterred by good legal
default advice at the outset. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAny lawyer who did bring these challenges to court would have to pursue the court proceedings to make sure they were paid for their work. This would 
defaultcreate a perverse incentive for cases to be pursued in court even when the initiation of judicial review is sufficient to persuade a public body to acknowledge its error and reconsider a decision (and there is ample evidence
default that this happens regularly). 
defaultL
defaultawyers will hav
defaulte
default an incentive to fight cases rather than to reach an early resolution 
defaultwhich will waste court time and ultimately cost public funds. We do not believe that this is good value for money nor does it assist the Government’s objective of securin
defaultg early settlement and preventing litigation wherever possible.
default&#xa0;
defaultI
defaultf it is introduced 
defaultthis provision 
defaultwill significantly limit access to justi
defaultce for 
defaultsome of 
defaultthe most disadvantaged
default people
default. 
defaultWe consider that this means that it 
defaultis likely to
default impact on acce
defaultss to 
defaultlegal rights contrary to A
defaultrticle 6
default of the ECHR
default.
