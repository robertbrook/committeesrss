[[[Church of England Schools]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.              The Church of England is the largest single provider of schools in the country, through its 43 dioceses. There are nearly 4500 Church of England Primary schools, and nearly 200 Church of England Secondary schools, between them educating over a million children.&#xa0;2.              Church of England schools are dedicated to serving their local communities by providing opportunities for children from all backgrounds to receive an excellent education within a framework of Christian values.&#xa0;

[[[Recent Success Stories]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.              St John’s Primary School, Bristol – St John’s redeveloped the local police station, making space for an increase in provision from 45 places to 75 places. This substantial increase for the school is a small but significant contribution to Bristol’s spaces shortfall. The school has now expanded for several years in a row, and the new building enables pupils to be accommodated properly.&#xa0;4.               St Mary’s Primary School, Hampton – St Mary’s is a completely new school, providing an initial 30 extra places for pupils of the local community. In order to undertake the project, the London Diocesan Board for School undertook additional procurement responsibilities to enable the significant building project to continue.&#xa0;5.              William Perkin CofE Secondary School, Greenford – The new William Perkin school has opened this September, providing places for a cohort of 180 pupils from all backgrounds. The school will be specialising in Language, Chaplaincy, Music and Science.&#xa0;6.               Many Church schools across the country are currently oversubscribed and stand ready to expand, in order to meet rising demand from population rises.&#xa0;

[[[Priorities for Church schools]]]&#xa0;7.               Provision of Church of England places is managed by the local Diocesan Board of Education (which has the statutory responsibility under the DBE Measure (1991) for approving additional places or schools.) While overall responsibility for expanding or reducing places remains with the Local Authority it is important that officials recognise the contribution of Church of England schools. 8.              The long term partnership between the dioceses and the Local Authority is essential to getting the provision right. New mechanisms e.g. competitions, only work for new providers if the LA is convinced of the need to broaden the range of providers.  Dioceses of the Church of England are anxious to do all they can to support Local Authorities in providing high-quality places for young people in their area. &#xa0;8.              Consultation is an important part of providing any extra provision, and there is good practice in many areas, with dioceses and schools as genuine consultation partners. At a time of rapid expansion it is essential to retain the consultation processes even if it takes longer to arrive at a plan. &#xa0;9.              Many dioceses have put in considerable effort to remove unsatisfactory temporary buildings from their stock, and are anxious that they should not return. Any expansion should be properly funded for long-term benefit.&#xa0;

[[[Challenges for Church schools]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]10.              Many parents prefer a Church of England school for their children, and dioceses are keen to make sure there are enough places for all who want them. In most cases relationships with Local authorities are good, and consultation over additional places includes the dioceses. In a very few places there is a hostility towards Church of England involvement in schools. We have evidence of decisions on new schools being clearly motivated by that hostility and not by the wishes of the community or the best interests of the children. This raises the question of how decisions are arrived at particularly if the LA is also bidding for a new school. &#xa0;11.              The primary challenge limiting the ability of Church schools to respond to increased demand for school p[laces is funding. Current funding from Basic need and Targeted Basic Need has enabled a limited number of projects to go ahead. Significantly more funding for the expansion of places is vital if the Church is top play a part in serving need in local communities. However places are often required in areas with extremely limited land arability and consequently any solutions must be more imaginative. Balancing imaginative solutions with refusing to compromise in the experience available to children, in for example outdoor play facilities, is a tricky equation. &#xa0;11.              While the most immediate need for school places is currently focussed on the primary phase this will translate to pressure on secondary schools from 2017 onwards. There is a pressing need to plan in advance for this. Rather than relay on competitions or random allocation across different schools bringing all providers in a local area together to develop a local plan should be more efficient, effective and equitable. &#xa0;October 2013&#xa0;
