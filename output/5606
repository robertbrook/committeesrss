defaultWritten evidence submitted by Amnesty International UKdefault&#xa0;defaultSummarydefault&#xa0;
defaultAmnesty International (AI) welcomes the Commons Liaison Committee’s focus on violence against women and girls for its session with the Prime Minister on Tuesday 14 January 2014. Through our work focusing on improving protection for women’s human rights, our concerns span both foreign and domestic policy.
default&#xa0;
defaultA report by the World Health Organisation in 2013, drawing together data from a range of studies, found that worldwide 35% of women have experienced violence, and that the consequences can be devastating. The statistics for the UK alone
default indicate that violence against women and girls should be a priority for the UK Government.
default&#xa0;
defaultAI welcomed the UK Government’s Call to End Violence Against Women and Girls, yet despite the commitments laid out in this strategy, AI is concerned that approaches across government departments are still ad hoc, and that a consistent understanding and approach to violence against women and girls across all government policy areas is still lacking.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is AI’s view that protection and support for women human rights defenders, support for women’s rights organisations, investment in specialist women’s support services, and a strong programme of work on prevention
default 
defaultare crucial components to any government strategy to address violence against women, whether applied to international or domestic policies. AI is particularly concerned that the UK Government has not taken a consistent approach to ensure that these measures are integral to its work in addressing violence against women and girls across government.

defaultDepartment for International Development (DFID)
default’s
default widening remit of its Country Programmes to include addressing VAWG in 27 countries, especially the incorporation of VAWG as a strategic priority in Afghanistan, however work on the ground remains thin with only 3 out of 27 country programmes having VAWGs as a strategic priority.

default Violence Against Women and Girl’s, a key recommendation of which was the need 
defaultfor DFID
default to focus on implementation of key policy frameworks, including those outlined in 
defaultDFID’s 
defaultTheory of Change and the Strategic Vision for Women and Girls. One of the main challenges the report highlighted was the need to:
default&#xa0;
default“Prioritise violence against women and girls at country levels and to bring DFID’s programmes in line with the Theory of Change, so that the best practise it highlights is properly implemented.”default&#xa0;
defaultAmnesty International is concerned that the best practice highlighted in DFID’s Theory of Change has not yet b
defaulteen fully mainstreamed into key 
defaultDFID country programmes. In Afghanistan, for example, 
defaultwhilst 
defaultDFID has committed to prioritising action to tackle violence against women and girls, 
defaultit is not yet clear whether action will be developed with reference to and through implementation of the Theory of Change. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFor example it is unclear how far 
defaultDFID support
defaults
default, including through provision of funds
default (including core funding)
default, the work of women’s rights organisations and women human rights defenders (WHRDs) who are working on VAWG, often in very difficult if not dangerous circumstances. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs recognised by DFID’s
default T
defaultheory of 
defaultC
defaulthange
default, WHRDs are essential in the global fight against violence and play a major role in trying to reverse the social norms that allow such abuses to become part of everyday life. Yet WHRDs around the world face threats, intimidation, abduction, sexual violence and even killings because of their work raising ‘sensitive’ issues (sexual violence/reproductive rights) and challenging the status quo of male dominated structures. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultIn the DRC, women human rights defenders provide remarkable and resilient grassroots assistance to survivors of human rights abuses. Their work causes them to face threats specific to their work as human rights defenders, as well as threats specific to their gender. More work is needed to challenge the intimidation and increase recognition and support of their work, increased involvement of women’s groups in consultation, and increased positive visibility of their valuable role.
defaultThe ‘do no harm’ principle is important but should not prevent work taking place – as stated
default as another key principle of DFID’s

defaultC
defaulthange
default: 
default“Backlash is inevitable but manageable: resistance to tackling violence against women and girls, which may include increased risk of further violence against women and girls, is inevitable where root causes are being addressed but can, and should be, managed.”
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultAmnesty international strongly believes that supporting women’s rights organisations and WHRDs on the ground through the provision of funding (including core funding) and technical support
default, and through on-going consultation with them on best practice approaches to support them in their work,
default could have a significant impact in the fight against VAWG, including sexual violence. 
default&#xa0;
defaultImportantly, support to Women’s Rights Organisations must incorporate recognition of the protection needs of women human rights defenders working on VAWG, who are regularly
default targeted with threats, violence and worse, both because their work challenges dominant, patriarchal social norms and, simply, because they are women.
default&#xa0;
defaultPSVI and United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325 on women, peace and securitydefault&#xa0;
defaultUNSCR 1325 reaffirms the significant role that women play in the prevention and resolution of conflicts, peace negotiations, peace-building, peacekeeping, humanitarian response and in post-conflict reconstruction, and stresses the importance of their equal participation and full involvement in all efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is essential that government departments coordinate work on 1325 with other crucial areas that impact on women in conflict affected areas, such as the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI). The political leadership shown
default by Foreign Secretary William Hague
default on PSVI is positive and it should be welcomed as an initiative, particularly since it gives such prominence to the importance of supporting WHRDs and their role in documenting abuses and supporting survivors. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe PSVI Declaration also makes specific reference to the importance of UNSCR 1325 and the recognition that attempts to tackle sexual violence in conflict should be consistent with
default,
default and contribute to
default,
default wider efforts to better implement 1325 and other resolutions on women, peace and security. There is of course significant overlap between 1325 principles and those of the PSVI and full implementation of both will only be achieved through a coordinated effort on each.
default&#xa0;
defaultBoth PSVI and 1325 rely inherently on the recognition that women are agents of positive change who must be included as active and full participants at all stages of conflict prevention, peace processes and in transitional justice. In order to measure progress in achieving these aims, the government should include specific indicators in the key policy documents of these initiatives (the National Action Plan on 1325, for example). Indicators should include the number of women involved in peace processes, the gender content of peace agreements, the number of women employed in the security and judicial sectors etc. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThrough championing the PSVI, the UK government is building considerable expertise on supporting WHRDs, particularly those working on VAWG issues. Yet in Afghanistan, a foreign policy priority, the UK has not developed a country specific plan for supporting human rights defenders, particularly WHRDs, even though this is a 
defaultrecommended action in
default both EU Guidelines and the Foreign and Commonwealth
default Office’s
default own guidance.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe UK government should apply the principles of PSVI and UN SCR 1325 consistently across its operations, and champion the work of WHRDs working on VAWG in – at the least – countries identified in the UK’s National Action Plan on 1325.
default&#xa0;
defaultAdditionally, a
defaultn important aspect of protection and support for women fleeing gender-based violence, such as sexual violence in conflict, is the ability to seek asylum and protection. The UK Government could do far more to ensure that the 
defaultcommitments evident in the PSVI
default are also consistently applied in the context of women and girls survivors of sexual violence, who are in need of protection and specialist support, seeking asylum here in the UK.
