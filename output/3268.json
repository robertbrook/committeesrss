"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Monica Waud\n&#xa0;\nSummary&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Recommendations suggested in Committee’s report and in report by Thomas et al. will not ensure the LGO meets the 5 key criteria laid down by the British and Irish Ombudsman Association especially fairness&#xa0;\n1.1 I write in my personal capacity as someone who has had personal dealings with the\n Local Government\n Ombudsman \n(L\nG\nO) \nintermittently \nsince 1994 and \nhad knowledge \nof campaigns such as Local Government \nOmbudsman \nWatch (LGOWatch) which show that t\nhe problems that I experienced obtaining redress via the Ombudsman \na\nre widespread.  \n&#xa0;\n1.2 \nThe \nSelect \nCommittee’s \n(CLG) \nreport of July 2012 considered the handling of evidence and \nat \nparagraph 67 recommended that \nin \nthose cases involving serious service fai\nlure\n \nthe LGO's processes should be brought into line with judicial procedures such as full dis\nclosure of all submissions\n.  Dr Martin saw her role as making findings and recommendations of remedy based on the evidence and facts.\n&#xa0;\n1.3 \nThe external evaluation of the LGO by Thomas et al. 2013 at \nR\necommendation 9 suggests that \nthere should be an independent reviewer of the service given by the LGO.  This would presumably ensure that the investigators follow the service guidelines.\n  \nHowever\n, t\nhis would do nothing to improve the quality of the evidence supplied by Local Authorities\n (LA)\n to the LGO in response to a complaint\n.  \n&#xa0;\n1.4 T\nhe CLG\n believe\ns\n that the appointment of an external reviewer will ensure that the LGO \nwill \nmeet the \n5 key \ncrite\nria of independence, fairness, effectiveness, openness and transparency and accountability.  Given that the role of the external reviewer would be solely related to service and not to the\n quality of the investigation\n, I do not believe this will improve the\n outcome for a significant number of complainants \nwhose complaints \nfail \nas a result of the LGO relying on unproven misinformation supplied by \nLAs.\n&#xa0;\n1.5 I have \nalways employed \nsolicitors to ass\nist me \nand \nsupplied the LGO with background evidence\n,\n usually LA\n documents\n,\n to support my complaints.  I believe that the LGO has always disclosed to me all the submissions from the LA.  However, it has been my experience that the LG\nO accepts the evidence from the\n \nLA as being fact \ndespite there being no evidence that the LA had investigated my complaint thoroughly (or possibly even at all) by interviewing or writing to the individual officers involved.  It does not seem fair that \nthe LGO\n \ncan \ndismiss\n a complainant’s evidence \nand acce\npt that of a LA if the LA has not considered the complaint internally.\n  In my case, the LA mislead the LGO over a number of years and when evidence came to light which proved my point beyond any doubt, the LA was told it did not need to investigate that co\nmplaint because it had already done so in the earlier complaints.  This missed the crucial point that the previous investigations (if they \ntook place\n)\n must have \nbeen\n \nflawed\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.6 I accessed the \nGuidance on Investigations used by the LGO investigators and \nthe investigators had followed procedures therefore an external reviewer would not have been able to assist me had he/she been in post.\n  \n&#xa0;\n1.7 Dr Martin states in her letter of 1 October 2013 to Mr Betts that \n“\nwe will always share our provisional view on a\n complaint that we investigate, and take comments from both parties, before making a final decision.\n”\n  That procedure took place with my complaint but the LGO accepted the LA\n’\ns version of events without background evidence or visiting the Council to view f\nil\nes/interview relevant personnel and so the course of action suggested by Dr Martin is not new in my experience and so will not make a difference when the LGO is intent on accepting the word of the LA.\n&#xa0;\n1.8 It is my belief from \ninformation that \nI have \nreceived from\n the LA\n,\n \nthat \nthe \nofficers concerned were not asked to respond to my complaints and that the LA’s\n response to the LGO was based on what can best be described as ‘wishful thinking’.  The fact that the information provided by the Chief Executive\n is in conflict with the advice given by the \nLegal Services M\nanager (and acted upon by other officers\n to my detriment) is not denied by the LA\n’\ns Monitoring Officer.  There is no committee within the LA that has the power to require any of these senior offi\ncers to investigate the conflict and act in the public interest to \nprevent repeat maladministration.\n \n \nR\necommendations\n on how to prevent a recurrence and how to fill this serious gap in the Council\n’\ns procedures would have been two obvious results of the com\npla\ni\nnt having been properly investigated.\n&#xa0;\n1.\n9\n The LGO appears unable to employ the highly specialised personnel required to unpick complex cases of maladministration in speci\nalist areas \nwhich include planning and not just social care.\n&#xa0;\n1.\n10\n \nThe inability \nof the LGO to remedy the maladministration has caused me to ask my MP for assistance.  As yet, he has been unable to\n provide me with\n \nadvice as to how the injustice to me can be resolved \nwhere the LGO fails in its investigation \nor to\n ask the LA to resolve t\nhe conflict in order to prevent a recurrence of the \nmaladministration\n.\n&#xa0;\nPossible Solutions to ensure fairness&#xa0;2.1\n My\n complaint relate\nd\n to \nvery complex \nmatters which initially taxed my own legal advisers even though they were familiar with the issues.  I believe that the LGO should \nuse \nonly experienced specialist investigators \nfor\n such complaints so that complainants \nhave a fair chance of redress\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n \nIt\n should be cost neutral for the\n LGO \nto \nrequire LAs to append transcripts of interviews and written responses from o\nfficers\n \nincluded in the LA investigation\n \nto the response sent by\n the \nLA\n’\ns \nChief Executive to the\n LGO\n.\n  This would show whether \nthe \nChief Exec\nutive has \ncarried out a \nproper \ninvestigat\nion into the\n complaint or just refuted the complaint in isolation from\n the facts\n.\n  Time spent reading the extra documents \nwould be time well spent \nbecause \nsome LAs\n would admit\n their faults at an earlier stage withou\nt need for detailed investigation by the LGO and this in turn would lead to \nfewer dissatisfied complainants as\nking for reviews of their cases.  \n&#xa0;\n2.4 Consideration could be given to applying \nfinancial \npenalties to LAs which fail to investigate complaints p\nroperly or \nwhich \nprovide what Dr Martin referred to as misleading information in her report \non a recent case (12 003 713).\n&#xa0;\n2.\n5\n \nC\nurrent\nly \nit is all too easy\n for LAs\n to avoid a full investigation by the LGO.  \nAll incorrect LGO findings of \n“\nNo \nmaladministration\n”\n \nwhich are then considered by LA committee\ns\n give false reassurance to elected members that their council is performing adequately.  \nIf it is not possible to \ndevise systems that ensure that\n accurate information \nis provided by\n LAs\n on which \nthe LGO can reach correct decisions\n,\n then the \nprocess can only fail\n complainants and \nmaladministration\n is perpetuated.\n
