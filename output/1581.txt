[[[ANNEX 1]]]

[[[ SUMMARY]]]

[[[Current and recently completed CCS research projects involving UK universities and research institutes]]]&#xa0;A survey of ongoing academic CCS research is necessarily a work in progress and the information presented here should be taken as indicative only.  The Annex lists a total of 244 grants, of which approximately 20 are from EU funding sources, 11 from other international funding, 44 from industry/government sources and 13 from the UKCCSRC.  Entries for 156 grants from Research Councils UK ending in 2009 or later are also included; consistent data is available for these so further analysis is possible.  The total investment in these RCUK projects is over £95M.  Approximately 84% of this total (as shown in Figure 1) is from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and a further 8% each from the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC).  Reflecting the respective scientific remits of these funding Councils, the majority of funding (42%) is estimated to have gone towards projects that are relevant to CO2 Capture (see Figure 2 and 3).  The next largest  area , Capacity (34%), includes funding such as doctoral training centres or research centres where a core objective is in training, networking or building capacity within the academic community (but often also with some research).  Cross-Cutting Issues (13%) includes CO2 transport, whole systems analysis, CO2 properties/chemistry, economics, environmental aspects, public perception and policy.  CO2 Storage research for CCS is estimated to have received the least amount of funding (11%) out of these categories.  It should be noted that core funding for NERC Research Institutes such as the British Geological Survey are not included here. &#xa0;
