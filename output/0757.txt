[[[Back ground]]]Chronic diseases are now the commonest cause of death and disability in England and people who live with long term conditions (LTCs) are the biggest uses of services and greatest generator of costs. It is now recognised that the care and support needed to live with a LTC is fundamentally different to that for acute episodic conditions, and that this will require services for people with long-term conditions to be radically redesigned. However, despite exhortation from people who live with LTCs, consistent health policy, a robust evidence base and a compelling economic case, progress on the ground has been painfully slow with little improvement over the last 10 years.  &#xa0;Many of the elements needed to support change in England have been developed, drawing on international best practice, but they remain fragmented. Top down exhortation and targets have failed to influence change and clinical behaviour at the grassroots. The missing component, which is a practical, robust, reproducible and transferable delivery system developed by practitioners and service users in England is now available. &#xa0;

[[[Key issues ]]]The Delivery System is described below. Some of the key issues it addresses include:

[[[system]]]

[[[ for Long terms conditions]]]The delivery system provides a robust, systematic and reproducible approach, transferable to any setting and for people with any single or multiple LTCs, including multi morbidity which ensures that each person receives a uniquely personalised service bringing together support for self management with high quality clinical and social care, delivered in a systematic, coordinated and high quality manner. The two part delivery system includes a

[[[Care planning ]]]

[[[Implementation]]]The delivery system invites local services to work through the ‘house’ for the particular health / social care setting relevant to their particular population, ensuring that attitudes, skills and infrastructure are all addressed together by using a 

[[[quality assured approach]]] leading to culture and system change. Importantly, the care planning consultation is in the centre of the house; local services need to ensure that all of the elements of the house are reliably in place for every care planning consultation.This will involve: Alf Collins, Simon Eaton, Jim Phillips, Sue Roberts: with thanks to all those who have contributed 2&#xa0; Social prescribing is an ‘unfortunate’ term in common use for referral to non traditional community services to support self management such as exercise ‘on prescription’.
