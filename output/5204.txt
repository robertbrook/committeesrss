[[[Written evidence submitted by Terence Wilkinson [FBB0106]]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;In the following, the background to what might come to be seen as a scandalous episode in the decline of BBC standards of behaviour in respect of the suppression of sceptical opinion about global warming.The periodic nature of climate variation is outlined in the first two paragraphs which seek to cover, respectively, the historical background and a simplified description of the natural science and finally, some consideration is given to a possible explanation for the behaviour of politicians and media.&#xa0;Periodic variations of climate&#xa0;When the alarm about global warming was first raised with US media, politicians should have asked a range of scientists whether the late 20'th century climate change was exceptional, whether it was likely to continue indefinitely and whether atmospheric carbon dioxide could be responsible.  A range of views was important because the topic is clearly multi-disciplinary. They would have been assured that it was not exceptional as it was warmer still in Medieval and Roman times (for example grapes were grown in Northumberland) and such periods are usually followed by much cooler conditions (dark ages and little ice age).  Furthermore changes of climate such as 2C were typically what one would normally encounter by travelling no more than 200 miles in England.  It is too late now, of course, to ask those questions because the BBC in particular helped to ensure that they could not be asked, perhaps because the Trust and senior staff envisaged a never ending series of alarming stories to be supplied at minimal cost to themselves by environmental activists.  Whatever the reason, the worldwide cost must now be measured in hundreds of billions of dollars.&#xa0;The salient facts about climate&#xa0;1  The climate is periodic.  There are many regular cycles controlled principally by the large outer planets and the orbit of the earth around the sun.&#xa0;2  The long term variation (millennia) depends on the earth's orbit&#xa0;3  The cycle which causes significant periodic warming and cooling on a centuries scale has a period of just less than 1100 years. It was mainly responsible for the Minoan, Roman, Medieval and late 20'th century warming and it is effected jointly by Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus&#xa0;4  A cycle of period 178 years, also controlled by the three gas giants, is responsible for regular 'grand minima' when sunspot activity is minimal such as the Dalton, Maunder, Sporer, Wolf et al and, of course, for the one in which we now find ourselves.&#xa0;5  The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (period 60 years) and a closely related Pacific oscillation was responsible for the recent reduction of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean, for the slight warming around 1940, cooling around 1970, and, having entered the cooling phase, growth of Arctic sea ice.  It also contributed to the late 20'th century warming.&#xa0;Herd mentality?&#xa0;An explanation for the disgraceful behaviour of the BBC in the matter of their unbalanced treatment of climate change reporting lies somewhere in the inexorable separation of the two cultures described in the book on that subject by C P Snow.  The fact is that the practical/scientific/technical culture should be the one that makes political/economic/media decisions on subjects such as climate change and what, if anything, to do about it.  However, the public school/grammar school/Oxbridge trained minds delivered to politics and the media generally, make those decisions in the belief that their background in humanities somehow gives them ability to make what they believe to be balanced judgements stemming from wide knowledge of human behaviour and history.&#xa0;Viewed from the other culture, their scientific ignorance, herd mentality and refusal to accept that they are out of their depth each time they speak about technical matters is astonishing.  What occurred was another example of Lysenkoism.  This time, thanks to the BBC, an even more expensive and dangerous example.&#xa0;Hampered by a hip problem and subsequent replacement I spent a few weeks thinking about climate and estimated, using widely available historical data, what I would expect the climate to be like over several millennia prior to 2000 AD and then up to 3000 AD including short term (decadal) changes in the complete absence of effects due to carbon dioxide.  I satisfied myself and many others that trace gases in the atmosphere must have no observable effect.  It is true that I had the advantage of a lifetime spent modelling a wide variety of complex technical problems but I was not by any means unique and very many engineers and mathematicians could probably have accomplished the same thing more elegantly or efficiently.&#xa0;The results of such calculations appear to show that historical data are sufficient to explain climate variation without having to consider 'greenhouse' effects and thus, carbon dioxide, the very stuff on which all life depends, is not a pollutant as asserted by the Supreme Court of the United States and all of humanity stands to gain by emitting more.&#xa0;We in this culture would not presume to make pronouncements or decisions about what lies properly in the domain of the other.  BBC staff should, perhaps, reflect on such issues and stand aside from discussion of complexities and arguments they can never hope to understand.  It is always best to stay silent lest ignorance be revealed.&#xa0;The wider problem of cultural separation is a matter requiring the attention of HMG and it's ministers of education.January 2014&#xa0;
