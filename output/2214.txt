[[[Sally Green â€“ Written evidence]]]&#xa0;I am writing to you about the draft Deregulation Bill, published on 1 July. Ihave a particular concern regarding the damage caused by 'offroading' in rights of way in areas of recreation and natural beauty such as national parks.&#xa0;I understand the Bill already includes some clauses on rights of way.

Thank you.Yours sincerelySally Green&#xa0;&#xa0;
