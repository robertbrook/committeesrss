[[[Union – Written evidence]]]&#xa0;The Broadcasting Entertainment Cinematograph and Theatre Union is the trade union for workers in the media and entertainment industry, with more than 25,000 members in the TV, Radio, Film, Theatre, and Cinema Exhibition sectors. Roughly 50% of our members are self-employed, and the proportion continues to rise as employers of permanent workers seek to casualise their workforces.&#xa0;On behalf of those self-employed members we have a number of concerns about Clause 1 of the Draft Deregulation Bill, which will exempt certain of them from a duty to observe health &amp; safety regulations, provided they pose no risk to others.&#xa0;

[[[r]]]The proposed clause goes far beyond the spirit of the original proposal for an exemption fromProfessor Ragnar Löfstedt in 2011. The professor has spoken widely since then about hisrecommendation being aimed at self-employed workers carrying out non-hazardous activities in ahome office environment. As currently worded, Clause 1 could be invoked by the self-employedworking in a multitude of different environments, some undoubtedly hazardous, as official accidentfigures reveal.&#xa0;

[[[d]]]There is a lack of clarity about the process by which a self-employed worker would determine that theyposed no risk to others, nor how this judgement would be recorded. This will create a situation wherethe individual’s determination of no risk to others would be exposed as wrong only after an accidentoccurs, an unsatisfactory way of regulating health and safety. Without a proper risk assessment, thereis a danger that self-employed workers could, in good faith,  judge that they pose no risk to others, yetgo on to cause injury to others by their actions.&#xa0;

[[[s]]]In the industries where we organise we foresee two distinct dangers:a) Self-employed workers will fail to observe health and safety regulations, not because they havecorrectly assessed that they pose no risk to others, but because abiding by the regulations is too muchtrouble.b) Unscrupulous engagers of self-employed workers will coerce them into flouting health and safetyrules, on the erroneous grounds that the exemption applies to them. In a sector where most workopportunities are obtained informally, this willbe hard to challenge, since raising  of health and safetyconcerns is will, and already does, prejudice the chance of future work from an engager.&#xa0;

[[[se concerns:]]]&#xa0;Despite being categorised by the Secretary of State as a “low-risk” industry, many self-employed workers in the sector are engaged in activities that involve significant hazards, both to them and others, and although the occurrence of serious accidents, as reported, is thankfully low, the two mostrecent fatalities in the industry were both suffered by self-employed workers. In the economy as a whole, fatalities among self-employed workers are more than twice as high per million than among employees.&#xa0;In many working situations our self-employed members are engaged as part of a team to execute a specified task, often the completion of TV or radio programmes, or a live entertainment event before the public. As such, the proposed exemption from the H&amp;S Act should not apply to them in most situations. Due to the team nature of the industry’s activities, our self-employed members will almost always pose some risk to other workers, or the public, in the course of their endeavours.&#xa0;However, our self-employed members often find that they have little control over their working environment, and are usually under the direction of an engager who exercises the right to specify how they carry out their work. Opportunities to secure engagements are available only through informal channels, with no systematic and transparent selection process, and the chance of obtaining an particular engagement depends heavily on reputation and the relationship with the engager.&#xa0;Anecdotally this has created a labour market in our industry where self-employed workers who are known to “cause trouble” by, for example, calling for proper health &amp; safety standards at work, find engagements hard to obtain. This deters self-employed workers from raising queries about health and safety in the course of their work, and many of our members complain that they are coerced into “cutting corners” against their better judgement, thereby increasing the level of risk to themselves and others.&#xa0;Breaches of the COSSH Regulations, Control of Noise at Work Regulations, Electricity at Work Regulations, Manual Handling Operations Regulations, Personal Protective Equipment at Work Regulations, Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations, Work at Height Regulations, and the Workplace (Health, Safety, and Welfare) Regulations, all of which apply expressly to the self-employed, are commonplace.&#xa0;Other areas of legislation and regulation where our self-employed members are asked to “cut corners”are the Working Time Directive and Manufacture and Storage of Explosives Regulations.&#xa0;Our concern over the proposed exemption of self-employed workers from H&amp;S laws is two-fold: firstly, where our members do pose a risk to others, there is a danger that the engager, or agents of engagers, will behave as if the exemption does, nevertheless, apply, and the practice of “cutting corners”, currently deprecated by those who understand the law, will become the norm.&#xa0;We can envisage circumstances where self-employed workers will be told by engagers that because of their self-employed status, there is no need to observe health and safety law, and those who question this incorrect interpretation of the exemption will find themselves informally black-listed and therefore unable to secure future engagements.&#xa0;Areas of H&amp;S regulation that could be ignored as a result have been listed already, and our prediction of widespread abuse is based on the experiences of our  self-employed members under the Working Time Directive, where they are routinely expected to flout the rules, with the offer of an engagement often being conditional on an overt agreement to relinquish their rights under the Directive. This is in breach of the law, but, sadly, has become common practice in our industry.&#xa0;Having noted the danger of engagers routinely treating self-employed workers as if they were all exempt from H&amp;S law, we now consider whether anyone in our sector can definitively be classed as posing no risk to others, our second concern.Hypothetically, let us take the example of a self-employed prop-maker who has determined on the basis of any of the flow-charts in the consultative document, that he or she poses no risk to others, and is therefore exempt from all H&amp;S legislation.&#xa0;The individual may well be working alone, in a locked industrial unit associated with a film studio, with no employees and a ban on visitors. Do these conditions, however, determine that he or she poses no risk to others?&#xa0;Our prop-maker could be producing an action prop for a film, TV, or theatre production, that may or may not involve: electrical parts (EWR); pyrotechnic or other explosive material (Explosives Regulations); substances that are hazardous either through being noxious or inflammable or both (COSSH); generation of dangerous levels of noise (NAWR); or inclusion of, or attachment to, a lifting device (WAHR).&#xa0;He or she may also, in the course of their work, damage the environment by failing to use correct disposal techniques for hazardous substances, or failing to contain dangerous fumes, and in extremis could, through careless handling of inflammable materials, cause a fire which would pose a risk to those summoned to extinguish the blaze.&#xa0;If our prop-maker hires or buys a piece of equipment to facilitate their work, can the supplier ignore their obligations under safety laws (PUWER, EWR, etc) because the renter/purchaser is self-employed? And what is the position if he or she ultimately produces an item which goes on to be used by others, and causes injury because some facet of safety law has been ignored thanks to the self-employed exemption?&#xa0;In short, we believe that in the media and entertainment industry, taking account of the specific roles fulfilled by our self-employed members, even where workers deem themselves, perhaps with the best of intentions, to pose no risk to others, there will still be the potential for hazards in the products, or by-products, of their work.&#xa0;
