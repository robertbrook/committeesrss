defaultWitnesses: 
defaultDr David Bennettdefault,
default Chair and Chief Executive, 
defaultStephen Haydefault, Managing Director of Provider Regulation, and 
defaultAdrian Masterdefaultsdefault, Managing Director of Sector Development, Monitor,
default gave evidence.  
defaultQ1 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultGentlemen
default, thank you for coming. I should say at the outset that I am afraid we are going to be interrupted by votes on the 
defaultF
defaultloor of the House this afternoon, the first of which is quite imminent. So we are going to be a bit of a revolving cast, but we will try to make the best of that. Could I ask you, Dr Bennett, to begin with introductions? I do not think you personally need much introduction, but your two colleagues possibly do.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultYes. On my left is Stephen Hay. Stephen runs our provider regulation division and, like me, is an executive member of the board. Provider regulation is the bit of Monitor that looks after all the existing foundation trusts. Before 
defaultthat,
default Stephen also looked after the assessment of new trusts
default,
default so he knows quite a lot about that area too. 
defaultAdrian
default is also an executive member of the board. He is responsible for an area we call sector development. The core bit of that is our new role in pricing
default,
default but he also, in particular, looks 
defaultafter
default our economic and policy functions.
defaultQ2 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultThank 
defaultyou
default very much. I would like to begin 
defaultwith
default what I hope will be a relatively brief question exchange about the governance of Monitor. You will know that Dominic Dodd was proposed as chair, the Committee demurred from that proposal and Mr Dodd then withdrew. I simply ask you to tell the Committee where that leaves Monitor in terms of its own governance, organisation and 
defaultinternal accountability systems.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultBecause I have been doing both roles
default—
defaultchair and chief executive
default—
defaultfor a couple of years anyway
default,
default we had gone to great length
defaults
default to be as clear as we possibly could about how 
defaultto maintain a separation between those roles, including asking my deputy chair, Stephen Thornton, to play a bigger role in the governance arrangements than would normally be the case. So, for the moment, we are keeping those arrangements in place. It is, of course, for the Department and the Secretary of State to decide about the specific appointment of a successor to me as chair
default,
default and I think they have written to the Committee
default—
defaultor I hope they have
default—
defaultsaying what they are planning to do on that front.
defaultChair:default 
defaultI think it is in the post.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultRight, so I am not sure what their specific plans are.
defaultQ3 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultWhen
default this evidence session is published
default,
default we probably should 
defaultinclude
default that letter
default. 
defaultThank you. Unless anybody wants to pursue that any further, I suggest we go into the meat of this afternoon
default’s session. 
defaultI want to begin 
defaultwith
default the document you published
default,
default entitled 
default“
defaultClosing the NHS Funding Gap
default”,
default in which you published four broad headings where you thought the gap might be closed. 
defaultS
defaulttanding back from it, is that a definition of why it cannot be closed or a signpost as to how it can be? 
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultIt is most certainly meant to be a signpost 
defaultas 
defaultto what needs to be done to close the gap. From our point of view, one of the important message
defaults
default there is that it can only be closed i
defaultf there is a lot of innovation—a lot of new approaches—
defaultto the provision of health
default 
defaultcare, approaches that we have not seen today, or certainly have not seen in this country. 
defaultThe second thing which that document highlights is that it is going to be a big ask. 
defaultI
defaultf you take all the things we could identify in terms of doing what is done today more effectively and efficiently, if you do everything we could identify in terms of doing things in different settings
default—
defaultmore or less as we do them today but not in the same setting, so, of course, in particular this is about transferring care currently done in
default hospitals to outside hospitals—
defaultand a first cut at what some of the more obvious 
defaultopportunities might be to adopt
default practices from other countries in order to innovate within the NHS
default, 
defaultyou cannot close the gap. In fact there is a big gap remaining. 
defaultT
defaulthat innovation piece has to be much bigger than just the obvious options from abroad and it is going to be a real stretch to get there.
defaultQ4 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultI suppose 
defaultit
default is fair to say
default—
defaultis it not
default—
defaultthat we could be more confident
default,
default we could get there in a service where there is a wide variety of current efficiency and quality outcomes if we could point to a single health economy where there was good progress being made and could say, 
default“
defaultAt least in that area, despite what is going on elsewhe
defaultre, they are going to get there.”?
default Is there anywhere where you think that is true?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultI might ask 
defaultAdrian
default for his view on that. One thing we would say is that you see examples of good practice in many health economies, England included, but I am not sure there is really good evidence of any health economy that has all the different pieces together in a coherent way. 
defaultAdrian
default, what would you say?
defaultAdrian Mastersdefault: 
defaultYes, I would agree with that. I do not think there is one health economy that has done everything needed. 
defaultQ5 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultWould it be a 
defaultworthwhile
default analysis to look at one of the front runners and close the gap in that health economy between where they are likely to get to over the period to 2020 and where they need to get to and ask what is stopping it?
defaultAdrian Mastersdefault: 
defaultIt is a good idea. 
defaultF
defaultor the planning round that we are preparing for over the next few months
default,
default 
defaultwe are 
defaultgoing to look five years out and 
defaultat 
defaulttwo years in detail. 
defaultW
defaulte plan to set up that planning round in order to put in all the new ideas that people have about how we can change the pattern of care. Out of that planning round
default,
default we will begin to get a sense of which parts of the country have the best view of how the challenge is going to be met. So it is a good idea
default,
default but we should wait and see what the outcome of the planning round is that we are going to run between now and probably next June or July.  
defaultQ6 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultI have one more question 
defaultand
default then I will pass it over to David 
defaultTredinnick
default. The concern everybody must have is that this is a real and present developing crisis
default,
default unless a way through can be found, not just for the trail blazers but for the bulk of the health economies. 
defaultAdrian Mastersdefault: 
defaultClosing the gap looks out to 2020
default&#x2011;
default21. 
defaultI
defaultn terms of current practice, you can see the current variation. You have a much clearer view of what could be done in the short term than you do, say, five years out. As you go five years out
default,
default you begin to say, 
default“
defaultWhat are the new ideas and patterns of care that are going to close the gap?
default”
default I do not think it is surprising to say that we do not have a strong view at this stage as to what those might be. All we can 
defaultc
defaultall out, though, is 
defaultthat
default we need to deliver not only in terms 
defaultof the current pattern of care—“Do it more efficiently,”
default and take some of the good examples that we are already having, what you might consider the next pattern of care, things like Torbay, trying to provide better care and keep
defaulting
default pe
defaultople well outside hospital—
defaultbut also 
defaultwe 
defaultneed to put effort now into what is going to be the next version
default,
default the third version
default, 
defaultof the future pattern of care. So
default,
default in the short term
default,
default we have things that we know we need to do and we are going to look for this planning round to help us work out what is the next block of changes 
defaultthat 
defaultwe need to make.
defaultQ7 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultI simply observe that we are running a stopwatch in this Committee now as to when the first mention of 
defaultTorbay
default as a good example
default comes up
default,
default and the answer 
defaulttoday 
defaultis eight minutes.
defaultAdrian Mastersdefault: 
defaultI am disappointed 
defaultthat 
defaultit was not earlier in a way.
defaultQ8 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultIt would be nice to 
defaulthave
default another example.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultYes. Therein lies a story, does
defaultn’t
default it?
defaultQ9 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Wollaston:default 
defaultWhat if during your 
defaultplanning
default round you come to the conclusion that some forms of competition are wasteful and
default,
default therefore
default,
default it might not be possible? Does that not put you in conflict with your purpose as an organisation? Is there not a tension there
default,
default because there may be some circumstances in which having over
default&#x2011;
defaultprovision
default increases costs?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultFirst of all, it is not the planning round as such that would reveal that. But, of course, you do point to a very big concern that lots of people have, which is that competition might be at least obstructing the ability to make the necessary changes and, as you suggest, may be even creating a degree of inefficiency because you need some extra capacity in order to make the competition effective. 
defaultT
defaulthose are important issues. It is not, I do not think, the planning round that will reveal those
default.
default I think 
defaultthey
default have to be dealt with in parallel with the planning round.
defaultDr Wollaston:default But 
defaultwould
default you be looking—
defaultChair:default 
defaultSarah, that is a taster, if I may say so, of the discussion 
defaultabout
default competition which is to come after this Division and after David 
defaultTredinnick
default has had his question when we get back. We will come back as quick
defaultly
default as we can.
default 
default              
defaultSitting suspended for a Division in the House.
defaultOn resuming—
default 
defaultChair:default 
defaultIf we may, let us get started. I understand it is unlikely
default—
defaultbut not certainly so
default—
defaultthat we shall be disturbed again by a vote. Let us hope not. David 
defaultTredinnick
default has a question to ask you specifically on the funding gap and all that
default,
default but so does Andrew George
default. S
defaulto can we go to him first, then back to David and then 
defaultto Sarah on competition?
defaultQ10 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default In terms of “C
defaultlosing the 
defaultNHS Funding Gap”,
default the fourth of your four bullet points was in relation to 
default“
defaultAllocating spe
defaultnding more rationally”,
default which of course is not within the gift of Monitor. Given that that is perhaps a forlorn hope, to what 
defaultdegree
default is that a factor in the large extent of a financially challenged foundation trust, for example, that exists at present? How much would you say that a fairer, less historic
defaultal
default and more objective, as you put it, funding mechanism or resource allocation would help to resolve the financial difficulties that they face?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultThere are interesting questions about the allocation of resources to individual providers. Indeed, there are interesting issues around the starting point, the structural position
default,
default of different providers. We observe that small and medium
default&#x2011;
defaultsized
default providers, especially where they have multiple sites, perhaps if they have very old buildings and the like, will have structurally higher costs. 
defaultT
defaulthere are all sorts of issues around that, but that is not what we were focusing on there. We were focusing there in particular more on the issue about, at its starkest, 
default“
defaultHow much do you spend on health
default 
defaultcare?
default”
default versus, 
default“
defaultHow much do you spend on things like prevention and public health?
default”
default We have not looked a lot at that because you are absolutely right that that sort of issue is also beyond our remit. If you were to ask what, in the long run, is one of the most effective ways of surviving at lower rates of increasing funding than the NHS has had historically, I woul
defaultd suggest that sorting that out by 
defaultinvesting some of the money we currently spend on fixing people once they are ill 
defaultin measures to prevent
default them from getting ill in the first place would enable us to have a healthier population 
defaultand a lower level—
defaultmaybe e
defaultven a significantly lower level—
defaultof spending. But it is a massive challenge, of course, to get from where we are today to that world.
defaultQ11 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultBut where you are observing, and you are no doubt analysing very closely, the relationship between allocation and financial pressure, or indeed those trusts that are failing financially, is there a pattern that ha
defaults emerged in terms of those whom
default Monitor believe are receiving historic underfunding, or who are significantly below what the Government have said is their target, for example, and the existence of trusts that are failing financially? Is there a pattern there?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: Of course
default the funding allocation goes to commissioners, not to the trusts.
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultQuite, yes.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultBut then, of course, it finds its way to the trusts. In so far as what the trusts are paid is dependent on payment by results, or at least payment by activity, then you might say, to a certain extent, it does not matter how the commissioners are funded. If they 
defaultare 
defaultdoing 
defaultthe activity, they get paid for it. In truth, of course, there 
defaultis 
defaulta big chunk of what they do that gets paid for not through payment by results but through block contracts or similar arrangements. What we can say is that
default,
default often
default,
default where we have a struggling trust
default,
default we also have a struggling health economy. As to whether they are struggling as a health economy because they are underfunded
default,
default it is a bit difficult for us to say, but you often see a struggling trust and an economy struggling
default,
default and commissioners and maybe other trusts in the area struggling as well.
defaultQ12 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultThe NHS 
defaultConfederation
default say
defaults
default that your role should be expanded or you should take on the
default role of supporting financially 
defaultchallenged trusts. We know that you are the sector regulator, or at least have been. To what extent do you believe that you have a pastoral role, as it were, in supporting and assisting financ
defaultially 
defaultchallenged trusts?  
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultIf a trust gets into difficulty
default,
default it is most certainly our job
default—
defaultand this is what
default Stephen spends his days doing—
defaultwhether it is because of the quality of the care they are providing or their financial position
default, 
defaultto try and help them get out of their difficulties. Sometimes
default,
default that may need money. We do not hold that money. We have to go to the Depa
defaultrtment of Health,
default sometimes in support of or alongside a trust, depending on the specific circumstances, and make a case for funding. We will only do that if we are satisfied that they have a credible plan to turn themselves around and a credible leadership to implement that plan. Sometimes
default,
default we will find a situation where the problems at the trust are quite structural in nature, things like being very small or having multiple sites and all these sorts of factors.
defaultStephen Haydefault: 
defaultOr PFI.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultA big PFI is another good example. Under those circumstances
default,
default we may have to seek more significant action to fix the problem, including restructuring the services. That is something that we are going to see more of in the coming years.
defaultQ13 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew defaultGeorge
default:default 
defaultTo what extent does that role harmonise with that o
defaultf the Trust Development Agency—
defaultthe TDA?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultYes, completely. We work very closely with the TDA for two reasons. One, we are essentially both doing the same thing. They have a much more direct hands
default&#x2011;
defaulton relationship with their trusts
default,
default but, frankly, once our trusts are in serious difficulty
default,
default we have a pretty hands
default&#x2011;
defaulton relationship with them as well. What we are trying to do with them is the same thing
default,
default and, furthermore, because there is this phenomenon of 
default“
defaultstruggling trusts often m
defaultean struggling health economies”,
default you often find neighbouring trusts in difficulty and you cannot fix one without fixing another. A very good illustration of this is 
defaultthat 
defaultwe have a struggling trust in 
defaultMilton Keynes
default. They had some quality problems
default; they
default fixed the quality problems
default,
default but then they became financial problems. It is now pretty clear that the financial problems can be fixed only with some rather more fundamental restructuring
default of services. The TDA has a not-far-
defaultaway trust at Bedford
default,
default which has both quality and financial problems. Rather than try and fix them separately we have, along with NHS England, commissioned some work to look across the whole health economy led by the commissioners
default, because t
defaulthat is where 
defaultwe
default have to start, to try and work out what the pattern of services needs to be in that whole health economy
default,
default and then, as a result of that, work out what we are going to do with Milton Keynes and what the TDA is going to do with Bedford. 
defaultQ14 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultAre there any lessons to be learned from the work that you have done so far in terms of
default,
default 
default“Is there a pattern of financially
default failing and quality of patient outcome failing trusts?
default”
default Do the two go hand in hand
default? W
defaulthere there a
defaultre financially troubled trusts, i
defaults the pattern, in other words, the cause of that financial difficulty? Are there common themes which run through th
defaulte trusts that you have found that
default are in difficulty?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultYes. We have done some work on them and Stephen might like to talk about that.
defaultStephen Haydefault: 
defaultThere is no doubt that where there are quality failings they almost inevitably then lead into financial failings because fixing the quality adds to the cost base. You can see at places like Mid Staffordshire, Milton Keynes and 
defaultMorecambe
default 
defaultBay
default that substantial increases in the cost base then lead to financial difficulties. Actual financial failings, as David has said, could be a wide range of things from bad management, structural problems
default and
default big unaffordable PFI schemes to problems in the local health economy with the commissioners unable to afford the services that are being provided. 
defaultDr Bennettdefault: T
defaulthere are two important lessons that certainly I have learned over my time at Monitor. The first was to look at a very early stage
default,
default where you have a financially troubled trust
default,
default as to whether or not there are structu
defaultral issues. To a certain extent, in the past,
default we used to focus on the leadership of the trust, the board, the management of the trust
default,
default and say, 
default“I
defaultf they are failing, 
defaultoften almost invariably there a
defaultre weaknesses in the management
default,” and we would try and fix that. But increasingly—
defaultand I think this is partly a reflection of the margin for things being less than perfect shrink
defaulting—
defaultwe are seeing that even when you fix the management, if there are underlying structural problems, you still have not fixed the financial problem. Then that extends how long it takes to fix it. So one of the lessons is, at a very early stage, to try and understand if there are structural problems
default,
default so that we can get 
defaultgoing on those straight away. 
defaultThe second lesson I have learned
default—
defaultand this is a particularly recent one in a way
default—
defaultis that we have a failu
defaultre regime which is institutionally based: it is
default abou
defaultt individual trusts. W
defaulte are applying it for the first time at Mid Staffordshire
default,
default and the TDA ap
defaultplied it for the first time in 
defaultS
defaultouth London
default. 
defaultParticularly looking at Mid Staffordshire, what is absolutely clear is that we have a health economy that is 
defaultfailing
default and the worst consequence of that is in Mid Staffordshire, but it is most certainly not confined to Mid Staffordshire. 
defaultW
defaulthat we really need is a failure regime for health economies. We can construct that and that is effectively what we are trying do with Milton Keynes and Bedford now
default,
default to say they are not in failure but they are struggling and we need to look at the whole health economy, not just individual institutions.
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultThank you. 
defaultChair:default 
defaultCan we move back to David and then on to Sarah?
defaultQ15 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultI am sorry
default, Chair, that
default I was late after the Division. You have touched on various financial challenges facing trusts. What are your overall priorities? Can you list them in order of importance, please?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultAmong what sort of choices are you thinking of?
defaultQ16 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultWhen you 
defaultare
default dealing with the financial challenges of foundation trusts
default, what are your priorities? You 
defaultmust 
defaulthave
default some structure for choosing what to deal with 
defaultfirst. Can you give me an idea of what 
defaultis 
defaultyour top priority, your second priority and 
defaultyour 
defaultthird priority?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultI will make one general statement and then pass to Stephen. My general statement is, as Stephen says, 
defaultthat 
defaultyou will often see quality and financial challenges at the same time. I am absolutely clear that we need to fix the quality problems first and
default,
default if those either exacerbate or lead to financial problems
default,
default then we fix those subsequently.
defaultQ17 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultWhat 
defaultdo
default you mean by 
default“
defaultquality problems
default”—
defaultquality of what?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultIt could be about patient safety, the quality of outcomes or about patient experience, all the things that the CQC looks at to determine whether or not a trust is providing adequate quality care. Those must be fixed first, but then, when it comes to addressing the financial problems, as I said, we have learned that we need to look at an early stage at whether there are
default underlying structural problems.
default Stephen, perhaps you might say a bit more about what we do.
defaultStephen Haydefault: 
defaultYou obviously have to make sure that the problems are fixed and 
defaultfind 
defaultwhether there are structural problems in the local health economy or not. Then the two things that really matter 
defaultare
default that you need in place a robust plan to turn the financial problems around, and we will look to get that in place quickly with or without external help, and then you need a leadership team that you have confidence in that can deliver that turnaround. That will be the order we would look at it in.
defaultQ18 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultI put it to you, despite what you are saying, that there are many people out there who think the sector is approaching a crisis point. Do you think that is fair?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultThe challenges are getting greater.
defaultQ19 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default Can you e
defaultxpand
default that
default, please?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultIt is what we were talking about earlier on. Lots of people, including us, have taken a look at what the likely gap is between funding and the underlying costs of the sector
default,
default and most of us have concluded that if there was no significant change to the efficiency of the sector and funding does no better than increase with GDP
default—
defaultand of course that is better than it has been recently
default—
defaultyou are looking at something like a £30 billion gap by 2021
default&#x2011;
default22. 
defaultY
defaultou have a big gap there. I think you have a particular problem with 2015
default&#x2011;
default16.
defaultQ20 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultThat was my next 
defaultquestion
default. Where do you think we are going to be in 2015
default&#x2011;
default16? What is your horizon? What does your vision tell you? What are you 
defaultsaying 
defaultin the boardroom about it?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultIn 2015
default&#x2011;
default16, as you will know, there is an additional £2 billion taken from the NHS to be put into the integration transformation fund. That is expected mostly to come out of the acute sec
defaulttor, which means that the acute trusts
default in particular are going to face a very significant funding squeeze in 2015
default&#x2011;
default16. So
default,
default although there is this challenge we were talking about earlier of
default,
default 
default“
defaultHow do you get yourself to a position where you can deal with a situation, say, in 2021
default&#x2011;
default22?
default”
default just dealing with 2015
default&#x2011;
default16, I think, is going to be a huge challenge particularly because of the need to get there very quickly. We are in intensive discussions now with NHS England, with the TDA and with the Department of Health to try and work out how that gap between underlying costs and funding can be closed in 2015
default&#x2011;
default16.
defaultQ21 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultI can see, and we have discussed this at length in this Committee, the Nicholson challenge with funding, but how do you respond to the criticism 
defaultby
default the NHS Confederation
default, which
default said that you need to play a more active
default role in supporting financially 
defaulttroubled trusts? Do you think you have been dilatory in this respect?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultI am not sure what 
defaultit 
defaultis specifically that they would want us to
default do that we have not been doing.
defaultQ22 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultI 
defaultcannot
default speak for the NHS Confederation
default,
default but I would imagine that th
defaulte criticism has been put to you.
default 
defaultM
defaulty understanding is that they think you could have been more proactive in dealing with troubled trusts, that you could have been quicker off 
defaultthe mark when troubles occurred.
default 
defaultI 
defaultam asking you whether you think that is fair criticism. There must be some areas where you are less than happy about your performance. You cannot beli
defaulteve everything is right, surely.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultNo, of course not.
defaultQ23 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultCan I read you the 
defaultevidence
default they sent to us? 
default“
defaultWe are clear that the NTDA and Monitor need to play a more active role in supporting financially troubled trusts and to enable them to become sustainable or to make difficult change if this is not possible.
default”
default 
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultI said that there was a lesson to be learned about trying to identify where there are structural problems sooner rather than fixing the management first and then identify
defaulting
default any residual structural problems. We definitely need to do that. We also need to be requiring tighter time scales within which things get fixed. So
default,
default if there are structural problems
default,
default we need to confront them faster.
defaultQ24 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultDo you 
defaultthink
default that part of the problem is your managerial system, that you 
defaultdo not 
defaulthave the report structure right, that you are not getting enough information back at the right time? You are a comparatively new organisation. 
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultCertainly
default,
default there is a challenge and it is reflected in the big contrast between the TDA and Monitor. The FT policy establishes foundation trusts as autonomous bodies that are largely free to make their own decisions unless they get into serious difficulty
default,
default and at that point we step in. That then leaves open all sorts of questions about how closely we should be monitoring them. Should it be 
default“U
defaultntil t
defaulthey get into serious difficulty”,
default 
default“I
defaultn order to anticipate whether or not they might
default do so”,
default and, indeed, 
default“W
defaulthat constitutes serious difficulty?
default”
default What we are increasingly doing is monitoring more closely and stepping in at an earlier stage. But it is a difficult judgment
default,
default and I am sure you will find other people who will say we are beginning to pay too much attention to what they are up to and, in some cases, even stepping in at too early a stage. But my sense is that we do need to be monitoring more closely, trying to anticipate problems and stepping in more quickly where necessary.
defaultQ25 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultFinally, do you think you have the capacity to do all this?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultWe are significantly increasing our capacity. In pa
defaultrticular what I think— and Stephen and I have agreed—
defaultwe need to do and we are doing is to get more senior people with real managerial experience to help turn around under
default-
defaultperforming trusts.
defaultQ26 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultWould it be fair to characterise
default or sum that up
default as a migration within Monitor away from being a regulator 
defaultand
default a policeman towards being an intelligent shareholder on the part of the public?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultIf I may put it slightly differently, I would say we alwa
defaultys were, I hope, an intelligent
default 
defaultshareholder, b
defaultut there are many different relationships between shareholders and the organisations in which they hold shares. If you like, it i
defaults a question of, “How long is the
default arm in an arm
default’
defaults length relationship?
default”
default I would say we are shortening the length of the arm a bit.
defaultChair:default 
defaultOkay. We will not play with the metaphor any further.
defaultQ27 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Wollaston:default 
defaultI have one final point on your last comment. Do you know how many of those senior managers are also receiving redundancy payments from other parts of the NHS?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultWhich senior managers?
defaultDr Wollaston:default 
defaultYou said you needed more senior people with managerial experience
default—
defaultthat you are employing within Monitor.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultWe only have two at the moment, only one of whom has previously worked in the NHS and he was not made redundant.
defaultStephen Haydefault: 
defaultHe retired.
defaultDr Wollaston:default 
defaultSo the answer is none. Thank you for clarifying that because I think it is a point of some
default—
default 
defaultQ28 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultI am 
defaultsorry
default, when you said 
defaultthat 
defaulthe retired, did he retire with a package of any sort?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultI imagine he will have retired with his pension
default,
default as usual.
defaultQ29 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Wollaston:default 
defaultBut 
defaultnot
default a redundancy.
defaultStephen Haydefault: 
defaultNo.
defaultDr Wollaston:default 
defaultIt has been quite a controversial issue, so thank you for clarifying that.
defaultChair:default 
defaultSarah, I am sorry to interrupt you
default,
default but Valerie wants to come in on that before you go on to competition.
defaultQ30 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultWhere 
defaultare 
defaultyou getting these managers from?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultAs I say, we only have two at the moment and one
default—
defaultQ31 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultIn 
defaultresponse
default to Mr 
defaultTredinnick
default’
defaults
default question
default—
default 
defaultDr Bennettdefault: “
defaultWhere are we going to get the future managers from?
default”
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault: defaultthat you are going to get some more managers. It would really help, Dr Bennett, if I might say so, not to repeat the question we are asking because it means you are not listening to 
defaultthe question we have asked. It is a very simple question. Where are you getting these managers from in relation to Mr 
defaultTredinnick
default’
defaults
default question?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultWe have yet to determine because that is what we are planning to do. However, I hope we can get some from within the NHS
default,
default because I think people with NHS experience will be helpful.
defaultQ32 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultBut you must know where 
defaultyou are going to look for them.
defaultStephen Haydefault: 
defaultI am interviewing a number of people between no
defaultw and Christmas. I have a short
defaultlist of about five or six senior people. I would say half of them are coming out of the NHS and half have other backgrounds, whether it 
defaultis
default private sector, professional services or
default—
default 
defaultQ33 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultWhere
default are they coming from? Do you not know that your colleague is interviewing some people?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultOf course I do.
defaultQ34 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultRight, so you could not answer that question. Where are they coming from
default—McKinsey, Deloitte, KPMG? 
defaultWhat is the
defaultir
default background? You have interviewed them, so you must have looked at their
default—
default 
defaultStephen Haydefault: 
defaultNo, I am interviewing them between now and Christmas.
defaultQ35 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultBut 
defaultyou
default have seen their CVs.
defaultStephen Haydefault: 
defaultI have seen their CVs.
defaultQ36 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultSo where 
defaultare
default they coming from?
defaultStephen Haydefault: 
defaultA num
defaultber are current chief execs
default of NHS trusts or found
defaultation trusts. There are two who
default have come out of the big accounting firms.
defaultQ37 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultCould you tell us who they are? Do you
default want to give us a break
defaultdown
default?
defaultChair:default 
defaultNo, 
defaultI 
defaultdo not think
default—
default 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultDo you want to write to us then?
defaultStephen Haydefault: 
defaultNo, I cannot, because some of these individuals are currently employed and will not
default know that they are on my short
defaultlist yet.
defaultQ38 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultI think it is right 
defaultfor
default us to know where they are coming from 
defaultgiven that the Secretary of Stat
defaulte says he does not want any more managers and that you are just now appointing a whole load more managers. Maybe at the end of this process
default,
default you can say.
defaultStephen Haydefault: 
defaultI have to put in the capacity to deal with the financial challenges that we have just been discussing, that there are going to be more FTs that get into difficulty
default,
default and I need to have, as the Committee has set out, more capacity to deal with those problems.
defaultQ39 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultYou 
defaultknow
default that already, do you?
defaultStephen Haydefault: 
defaultYes because we can see that the number of FTs that are getting into difficulty is slowly rising and has been for a year or two. So, as David has said, we need to put more capacity into the team that I run.
defaultChair:default 
defaultCharlotte Leslie wants to come in and then we will go to competition policy.
defaultQ40 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default 
defaultI have a very 
defaultshort
default point. I think the reason people are concerned about it is that
default,
default in the past
default,
default managers have been taken from
default trusts that do not really
default have a track record of success and 
defaultthey are 
defaultbeing put in charge of other organisations to take those forward. Are you able to provide us with assurance and reassurance that
default,
default if you employ managers from trusts
default,
default we will be able to look at those trusts which they have come
default from and see a mark of success—
defaultthat we will not see them coming from a trust that has not performed well?
defaultStephen Haydefault: 
defaultThe quality of the work we do is based on the quality of the people we have
default.
default 
defaultT
defaultherefore
default,
default we go to extraordinary lengths to make sure we only appoint high
default-
defaultquality people
default,
default wherever they come from. If somebody
default’s name
default came across my desk that had question marks about where they had come from
default,
default in terms of a trust that had failed or wherever
default, we would investigate. W
defaulte would do proper due diligence to understand whether that individual was responsible for that 
defaultfailure 
defaultbefore we would begin to think about appointing them. 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default 
defaultThank you.
defaultQ41 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Wollaston:default 
defaultMoving on to another issue, Sir David Nicholson told us that in his view we are getting 
default“
defaultbogged down in a morass of competition law, which is causing significant cost in the system.
default”
default He believes that legislative change may be required. Dr Bennett, what 
defaultis 
defaultyour view on that and, with the Care Bill coming up
default, perhaps you could elaborate 
defaultwh
defaultat change you would like to see.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultThis is, I think, quite a complex issue. There are
default two ways in which competition issues—
defaultor things that a
defaultre perceived to be competition issues—
defaultare concerning people. One is around mergers and the other is around what commissioners do. 
defaultI
defaultf I could take the commissioner issues first, particularly the application of the so
default&#x2011;
defaultcalled section 75 regulations
default—
defaultthe procurement, patient choice and competition regulation
default—
defaultI think, unfortunately, there is an awful lot of misunderstanding and misinformation out there as to what those regulations do and do not require. They are not even fundamentally about competition. They are about doing commissioning well
default,
default and in fact they say that competition is only one of the tools available to a commissioner to secure better services for their patients. They even explicitly talk about other things like, in particul
defaultar, better integration of care.
defaultThese rules, apart from that bit about better integration, are essentially the same as the rules that have been in existence for quite some time. They used to be the 
default“
defaultPrinciples and rules 
defaultfor co-operation and competition”.
default They are hardly changed and the regulations are pretty well the same as the old rules. The biggest change is that we have different peo
defaultple doing the commissioning now, 
defaultfor a whole variety of reasons, and I think
default—
defaultnot least, unfortunately, because it has become an 
defaultincredibly controversial issue—
defaultthose commissioners are very concerned about what this means for them. Fundamentally, if they are doing good commissioning that is improving the quality of care for their patients
default,
default they should not have any problems
default,
default but this is clearly not the perception. So
default,
default on 
defaultthis front, above all
default we have to find ways of talking to these commissioners
default,
default 
defaulthelping
default them 
defaultto 
defaultunderstand what the rules really mean
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthere is a whole variety of things 
defaultthat 
defaultwe need 
defaultto do there
default and I have been in 
defaultconversation with David Nic
defaultholson about how we can do this. Working
default jointly with NHS England 
defaulton this 
defaultwill be very helpful because they have significant influence on commissioners and how 
defaultthey
default think about these things. I am hoping that
default,
default if we can explain to commissioners what it is that the rules do and do not allow them to do
default,
default we can deal with that, but I recognise that it is a huge challenge to explain it to people and there is a whole variety 
defaultof things that we need to do. 
defaultOn mergers, of course, what happened was that from April
default—
defaultand in fact before April
default—
defaultthe OFT took over responsibility for looking at mergers involving foundation trusts
default,
default and
default,
default again
default,
default here I think that there 
defaultis a huge amount
default of concern about the implication of the way those rules are being applied. People will cite Poole and 
defaultBournemouth
default as an example of where the rules got in the way of doing what some people at least think was the right thing to do. There 
defaultis
default again a variety of issues, some of which 
defaultare
default just about trying to help people understand what they can and cannot do, and there is a lot we can do on that front. One of the things with a merger is that it is extremely important to start with a good understanding of why it is that a merger is the right thing to do. I should say
default that
default, even where mergers have been allowed, the track record is not great. 
defaultB
defaulteing absolutely clear that
default,
default whatever the problem that a 
defaulttrust
default or a pair of trusts face
defaults
default, merger is the right answer is the starting point
default,
default and I think we can help
default—
defaultit is a bit more about shortening the length of that arm
default—
defaultto try and make sure that they have that right. 
defaultThe next bit is about understanding what the competition issues 
defaultare 
defaultthat they need to worry about. 
defaultF
defaultor whatever reason, people are hearing all sorts of strange messages about concerns which we do not, frankly, understand. So we need to do more to explain to people what are the likely competition issues and what sort of advice they need
default,
default if they do need advice
default,
default to deal with those issues. In fact
default,
default we are going to go a step further, which is to do for ourselves, in parallel with the trusts thinking about whether or not they want to proceed with the merger, some of the work that the OFT would do so that we can help the trusts to understand, 
defaultor 
defaultthe parties to understand, whether or not they are likely to have any issues and help them think through what they would do about it. If all of that is done well, that should deal with a lot of the problems we have. 
defaultT
defaulthere is another issue and I am not sure how to deal with 
defaultit
default. This is about how you think about whether competition issues should be an obstacle to allowing a merger to proceed. The way the competition authorities think about this is that they first of all ask themselves
default,
default 
default“
defaultIs there a significant lessening of competition?
default”
default If the answer is yes, they then say, 
default“
defaultIs this likely to be outweighed by the patient benefits that would accrue from allowing the merger to proceed anyway?
default”
default Then they try and work out exactly, or get the parties to tell them exactly, what those patient benefits would be. The problem is that there is a presumption that if there is a significant lessening of competition that is bad
default,
default and therefore you have to look at the concrete benefits of the merger and see whether they outweigh them. But the connection between there being a significant lessening of competition and that driving improvement in the quality or efficiency of care is a fairly tenuous connection. It is difficult. We can look at studies that tell us that competition does have some
default impact on the quality of care—and t
defaulthere are some studie
defaults done in England to show that—
defaultbut to translate that into, 
default“
defaultHow fast and how effectively would that competition improve the quality of care?
default” 
defaultis very difficult. 
defaultQ42 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Wollaston:default 
defaultOne of the 
defaultissues
default that is raised, of course, is that a lot of these judgments are clinical judgments about whether or not the care would be improved. What expertise would Monitor have to weigh up the financial and clinical benefits? Are you taking advice from 
defaultclinicians if they are telling you, 
default“
defaultActually
default,
default we need to do this because it is going to improve the clin
defaultical care that patients receive.”
default? That is a concern. The other concern is around the sheer cost of this. Very often there is a cost involved with a delay. Just to go back to Torbay
default—
defaultapologies, Chair
default—
defaultas you will know, they are wanting to undertake a vertical integration, but even then, even though there is not really a competition issue there, there is going to have to be a dela
defaulty while it goes through the OFT;
default but the significant delays, the OFT tell me, are not during the OFT process but 
defaultin
default getting everything ready in order for it to go to the OFT. There is a sense in which people are just drowning in the bureaucracy and cost
default,
default and it is having a chilling effect because of the joylessness, if you like, of it all and the cost of it all
default,
default when in fact what we want is these organisations to be making clinically
default&#x2011;
defaultbased
default decisions about integration. This is surely a h
defaultuge barrier to that happening. 
defaultIs that your view, Dr Bennett?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultThere were a few questions in there.
defaultDr Wollaston:default 
defaultI know.
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultIt was a speech, Sarah.
defaultDr Wollaston:default 
defaultIt was a speech. I am sorry about that.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultFundamentally, it is all about what is going to drive improvements for patients. The competition is only there on the assumption that it will improve the quality of care for patients. But, as I say, the challenge is really
default,
default 
default“
defaultCan you say how fast and how effective it will be at driving those improvements?
default”
default You asked, 
default“
defaultDo we take clinical advice?
default”
default Of course, it is no longer our responsibility to look at the mergers
default—
defaultthat weighing of these two things is now an OFT responsibility
default—
defaultbut
default,
default in so far as we do look at these things, abso
defaultlutely we take clinical advice; 
defaultwe absolutely must and do.
defaultQ43 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Wollaston:default 
defaultThe OFT 
defaulthave
default no clinical expertise, of course
default.
defaultDr Bennettdefault:
default I presume they take advice
default,
default though.
defaultQ44 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultDo you pr
defaultovide 
defaultopinions
default to provide that 
defaultadvice?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: As to 
defaultthe question of patient benefits, the more concrete thing
default—
defaultso
default,
default 
defaulti
defaultf you merge two institutions
default,
default what practical consequences will that have in terms of things like consultant rotas and so on
default?—
defaultwe will advise the OFT on that
default,
default and in order to provide our advice, absolutely, we will take clinical advice ourselves. But
default,
default in the weighing of the impact of the lost competition against the benefits of the merger, that is now something which the OFT does. I want us to 
defaulta
defaultt least offer our advice to the OFT on both sides of that. 
defaultIn terms of your example in 
defaultTorbay
default, yes, it is a vertical integration, so it is two organisations essentially doing different things. Under those circumstances, you might normally expect there would not be a competition issue. Our people have taken a look at this. We give a lot of informal advice here to try and help organisations work out what is the right thing to do
default,
default and our feeling is that it should not be something that the OFT should be concerned about. If you think you are going through a merger which should not be a concern to the OFT, you do not even have to notify them. You can just self
default&#x2011;
defaultassess
default that it is not an issue for the OFT. 
defaultQ45 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Wollaston:default 
defaultThat is very important. They can just go ahead
default,
default in other words. 
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultThey can, yes
default.
defaultQ46 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Wollaston:default 
defaultThey do not need to wait for the OFT. 
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
default No.
defaultQ47 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Wollaston:default 
defaultThey are not 
defaultaware
default of that, so that is great.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultThe OFT may notice that it is happening, might look at i
defaultt and might decide, in general—
defaultI am not talking
default now about Torbay specifically—
defaultthat they want to take a look at it. That could happen. But the parties can just get on with it if they want.
defaultQ48 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Wollaston:default The trouble 
defaultis
default that
default they are doing all the preparation work because they just do not know and it is causing huge delays.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultWe have advised them that we think they should probably self
default&#x2011;
defaultassess
default on this one.
defaultDr Wollaston:default 
defaultRight. Thank you for clarifying that.
defaultQ49 default&#xa0; 
defaultGrahame M. Morris:default 
defaultThat
default leads on to a number of questions that I want to ask Dr Bennett
default,
default and it goes back to the nub of the debates we had originally during the passage of the Health and Social Care Act, as it became, about what the consequences of competition
default 
defaultwould be. I did 
defaultmake 
defaultnote in an earlier answer to one of my colleagues
default—
defaultto Andrew George, it may have been
default—
defaultabout the implications of the section
default 75 regulations, which you down
defaultplayed, I might 
defaultsay. I
default think it is deeply significant
default,
default and you said the only difference is 
defaultthat
default the people who are commissioning the services are different. I would respectfully suggest that there is a fundamental difference in that something like £7 billion, £8 billion or perhaps £9 billion
default&#x2011;
defaultworth
default of NHS contracts are now provided by the private sector
default,
default which was not the case before. So 
defaultt
defaulthere is a fundamental difference. 
defaultI want to ask some particular questions about the conflict with competition. There must be significant costs, Dr Bennett, about the application in terms of delays and what are the costs within the system and the cost to patients of 
defaultdelayed 
defaultdecisions, merger decisions and so on. In 
defaulthis 
defaultevidence
default,
default Sir David Nicholson raised some issues about the conflict between measures to drive up quality being either frustrated or even obstructed by the application of competition law
default, and he ga
defaultve some particular examples
default. I
defaultn fact
default,
default he wrote an article in the 
defaultHealth Service Journal
default in September and talked, for example, about the chief executive in an NHS trust 
defaultwho 
defaultcould not 
default“
defaultbuddy
default”
default up with the chief executive of a neighbouring trust that was having financial difficulties because of the application of competition law. He talked about a federated group of general practices being unable to come together and deliver a better
default-
defaultquality service more efficiently because of worries about the application of competition law. Most disturbingly, he gave an example of an NHS trust having to stop doing cancer surgery even though they did not need guidelines in this area. 
defaultWhat is your response to the views of David Nicholson
default,
default expressed in that article
default,
default in terms of the consequences of competition and how it is frustrating quality?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultOn the point about how much has changed, the point I was making is that the rules themselves have not changed very much at all.
defaultQ50 default&#xa0; 
defaultGrahame M. Morris:default 
defaultCan I point something else out that I forgot to mention in my earlier question? When you said to Sarah Wollaston that it does not have to be referred to the Competition Commission, is not the problem that third parties
default—
defaultprivate sector companies, potentially
default—
defaultwill say to the Competition Commission that they should be investigating because it is a hindrance to competition and the opportunity that they have of winning new business?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: W
defaulthen I said it has not changed very much, I was talking about the rules. The rules are not very different at all. Most of what the Government did was put the old rules on a statutory footing. However, of course, because it was also controversial when the Bill was going through, and remains so now, part of what has happened here is that
default—
defaultand
default,
default of course
default,
default you simultaneously had the change in who was doing the commissioning, so you have a whole bunch of new commissioners, with the CCGs instead of the PCTs
default—
defaultthey have just 
defaultbecome
default very fearful
default,
default and I am afraid there is an awful lot of misinformation out there.
defaultQ51 default&#xa0; 
defaultGrahame M. Morris:default 
defaultIs that not predictable? During the course of the passage of the Bill and the pause
default, was not all this pointed out—
defaultthat there would be a feeding frenzy for competition lawyers, people having different opinions of how it applied in relation to the NHS and 
defaultthat 
defaultthere would be a consequential impact upon the quality of the service? Was not all that predictable? It was certainly raised during the course of the passage of the Bill.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultThe problem in part was simply that it was subject to so much very public debate that it got everybody anxious about it
default.
default 
defaultS
defaultometimes
default,
default 
defaultpeople
default hear things 
defaultthat
default are not at all accurate but 
defaultwhich 
defaultare promulgated as
default if they are facts and that causes
default 
defaultthem
default to get very anxious about it. You were tal
defaultking about the costs of it all, so t
defaulthat is what happens
default: p
defaulteople get anxious about it, think the only safe thing to do is to go and talk to a lawyer
default,
default and then it does get very expensive. 
defaultT
defaulthat is what has happened, I completely agree, and that is not the way we should be spending the NHS
default’
defaults money. 
defaultOn the points that David Nicholson raised, in the main
default,
default again
default,
default his concerns
default&#xa0;
default—
defaultQ52 default&#xa0; 
defaultGrahame M. Morris:default 
defaultHe gave some specific examples as well. He was not just talking in the round.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultNo, that is absolutely right. But those examples in many cases are a reflection of concerns people have about
default,
default 
default“
defaultIf in doubt, do not do it.
default”
defaultQ53 default&#xa0; 
defaultGrahame M. Morris:default 
defaultThe risk averse.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultThere are so many people out there fearing that they are not quite sure what the rules are and therefore will not do it.
defaultQ54 default&#xa0; 
defaultGrahame M. Morris:default 
defaultCan we 
defaultconclude
default then that competition is a bad thing?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultI think to conclude from that that competition is a bad thing would be a bit of a stretch.
defaultQ55 default&#xa0; 
defaultGrahame M. Morris:default 
defaultI was leading you 
defaultup
default the garden path there. Can I ask you another question about how we can clarify the position in respect of Monitor
default’
defaults guidance
default,
default because you are in the process of issuing some
default—
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultYes. 
defaultQ56 default&#xa0; 
defaultGrahame M. Morris:default 
defaultYou have consulted on the draft 
defaultguidance
default, have
defaultn’t 
defaultyou?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: That is right;
default quite a while ago, yes.
defaultQ57 default&#xa0; 
defaultGrahame M. Morris:default 
defaultPerhaps
default you could tell the Committee when the final guidance will be ready and what your views are in terms of how that will assist in clarifying the position?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultI hope it will assist. It has taken rather longer than I would have wished to go from the consultation to the final version. The heart of it is that we have been having very long discussions with NHS England about how best to explain all this stuff in a way that I hope will alleviate some of the unnecessary concerns that commissioners have. We did agree it today
default,
default so it now has to go to the Department of Health for sign
default&#x2011;
defaultoff
default with the Secretary of State
default—
defaultI hope he is going to be happy with it
default—
defaultand then we should be able to get it out very quickly. 
defaultQ58 default&#xa0; 
defaultGrahame M. Morris:default 
defaultIn 
defaultterms
default of the consultation period, when the draft guidance was available, what kind of responses did you get during that period
default,
default and in the final guidance have you given some particular examples, as Nicholson did?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultMost of the responses about which we could do anything were about trying to clarify things, and obviously we have tried to respond to those. In so far as anybody responded by saying, 
default“
defaultWe think this competition stuff is just inappropriate in health,
default”
default there is nothing we could do about it. The regulations are the regulations and our job is to produce guidance about how we will enforce them. Being clear and practical about how the regulations are to be applied is very important. Part of the reason it has taken so long is that we have been trying to produce case examples
default,
default because it is very difficult to write general guidance that will be meaningful to commissioners and people out there. They are not experts in this stuff and yet they are being asked to operate in this environment. That is very difficult. We now have a number of those in, but we need to do more
default,
default and now that the guidance is settled
default,
default I hope we can spend more of our effort on doing more case examples. That is very important. I want our people to get out there talking to these commissioners. We have 211 CCGs to talk to, but we need to do that. I am talking to David Nicholson about us doing it together again
default,
default so that they can understand that this is something that we are joined
default&#x2011;
defaultup
default about.
defaultQ59 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultAs 
defaultpart
default of your new role as sector regulator, you have announced a study into the GP sector and you have published your research into walk
default&#x2011;
defaultin centres. I have a few questions around that. Who commissions and prioritises that sort of work? What is going to be next in your research programme? What is the status of publications like the one on walk
default&#x2011;
defaultin centres
default,
default and how should commissioners and providers respond to them?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultThe decision about what areas to look at is a Monitor decision. It is within our general remit. In fact, technically, because we have concurrent powers with the Office of Fair Trading under the Enterprise Act, we can even do something called a formal market study, although that is not what these two studies are. In the case of GP services
default,
default the OFT was minded last year to do a review of GP services. We said we thought perhaps that was not ideal timing, first
default,
default because the system was going through a lot of change
default,
default and, second
defaultly
default, we were just about to get the powers to do the same sort of thing
default,
default and we thought the whole point of giving these powers to Monitor was so that these issues could be looked at by a body that is focused on health rather than by the general competition authorities. That was one of the reasons why we thought w
defaulte should look at GP services. 
defaultWalk
default&#x2011;
defaultin centres was an example of a situation where we had a number of complaints being made about the way in which 
defaultthey
default were being closed, or at least existing contracts were not being re
default-
defaultcontracted, and rather than look at every individual complaint we thought, 
default“
defaultThere is a pattern here. Let us look at it overall and start by trying to understand what is going on.
default”
default 
defaultW
defaulte started with a call for evidence, asking all interested people to tell us wh
defaultat they thought the issues were
default and also just gathering some facts. It turned out 
defaultthat 
defaultwe could not even find out how many there were initially. We discovered that in recent years about a quarter of all walk
default&#x2011;
defaultin centres have been closed. We discovered, unsurprisingly, I think, that a lot of the people who use walk
default&#x2011;
defaultin centres
default—
defaultand we did a survey of
default,
default I think
default,
default 2,000 users of walk
default&#x2011;
defaultin centres
default—
defaulthighly value them and
default,
default therefore
default,
default there were clearly concerns about the fact that they were closing. 
defaultAt the same time, of course, we talked to commissioners
default,
default and commissioners expressed concerns: for example, they are concerned that
default,
default if they have to pay a walk
default&#x2011;
defaultin centre every time a patient goes there but they are also paying the GP because that patient is on the GP
default’
defaults list, then they are paying twice for the same care to be provided, and obviously that is a very understandable issue. 
defaultA
defaultt the moment
default,
default all we have done is gather this evidence
default,
default and recently
default—
defaultthe week before last
default—
defaultwe published a summary of what it is we have heard, part of which is to say that there are clearly patient benefits to having these things and
default,
default therefore
default,
default we need to look very carefully at the consequences for patients if they are closed, although recognising there may be perfectly good reasons in individual health economies 
defaultfor why they are closed. 
defaultWith GPs
default,
default we have been through, essentially, a similar process of asking for evidence
default.
default 
defaultW
defaulte are compiling the evidence and we will be publishing that in a few weeks. Of course
default,
default the walk
default&#x2011;
defaultin centres and GP services do link, but particularly with GP services
default,
default because both NHS England, as the commissioner of GP services and the holder of the contracts with GPs, and now the CQC
default,
default with Steve Field taking over as the chief inspector of general practice, will have a shared interest in looking at how the GP services develop. We have been working very closely with these bodies, so one of the things we will do as we decide what to do next, in collaboration with those other two bodies, is to work out who should do what.
defaultQ60 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultWhat tests did you see being applied to decisions to close walk
default&#x2011;
defaultin centres? I have to say, there were two closed in 
defaultSalford
default on a fairly arbitrary basis of just having to find some savings
default,
default and they were well used and did have high patient satisfaction. Did you find that there was arbitrary decision making around those decisions?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultIt was certainly variable and that is
default one of the things that concern
default us. This gets to the heart of
default some of the section 75 stuff. T
defaulthat seeks to 
defaultmake sure
default wh
defaulten commissioners make decisions that
default they make them in an objective, transparent and fair way. It does not dictate how they make them but that they must go through a fair process. We have found some cases where it is not clear that that is what happened.
defaultQ61 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultOkay. If we look at your later study, 
defaultfor which
default you have issued a call for evidence
default,
default on the GP sector, in terms of 
defaultevidence
default to this Committee for today, the BMA have said they are concerned by your attitude to innovative models of primary care. They think you should move towards a payment system which better encourages integration and is based on outcomes
default,
default and they believe that you should be prioritising integration above the work you are doing around anti
default-
defaultcompetitive behaviour. So there is a very strong feeling that you perhaps do not have the right attitude towards innovation and that you are not prioritising integration
default,
default which they see as key.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultI can say here and now that we think innovation and better integration of services 
defaultare
default essential. Unfortunately, this is just another example of what we were talking about a moment ago, a misunderstanding about the extent t
defaulto which these things can happen, 
defaultgiven the rules around competition. There is no fundamental reason why integration 
defaultand 
defaultinnovation cannot happen without contravening the rules, but this is where we need to help people understand that.
defaultQ62 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultDo you understand why the BMA are so con
defaultcerned about your attitude to their
default innovative models of primary care?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultI am not quite sure why they are concerned. I met with the GP 
defaultleadership at the BMA last week
default to talk about this very issue.
defaultQ63 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default D
defaultid 
defaultit 
defaultnot emerge?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultThey did not express a concern with our attitude. 
defaultQ64 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default I
defaultt might be 
defaultsomething
default you ought to take up with them.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultWe need to talk to them again.
defaultQ65 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultClearly
default,
default you do. Can we move on to the 
default“
defaultFair Playing Field
default”
default review
default?
default I want to ask about changes that we are likely to see as a result of that, but
default,
default in ter
defaultms of evidence to us here today,
default Marie Curie have said that they think the whole of your organisation 
default“
defaultneeds to enhance its understanding of the charitable sector and specifically charitable providers of NHS services.
default”
default In fact, they have said that they think you should undertake an organisation
default&#x2011;
defaultwide
default review of how your organisation relates to and works with the charitable sector
default,
default and they are keen to support you in doing that.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultYes
default.
defaultQ66 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultThey are clearly concerned that you lacked knowledge in terms of that review and 
defaultthink 
defaultthat that is something you should address. 
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultI would certainly say that when we were going through the process of designing these new licences for providers, which is the new regime that we have been 
defaultoperating since 1 April—
defaultso this is stuff we were doing a year or more ago
default and
default we produced some draft licenses and consulted
default—
defaultone feedback we got was that we were drafting licences in a way that did not work in certain respects for the charitable sector
default,
default and we have changed it. We had not understood, they explained what we had not understood and we changed it. If there are further things that we have not understood, then, absolutely, I would be keen to find out and work with them. The charitable sector plays an extraordinarily important role in the provision of health
default 
defaultcare and related services in this country
default,
default and we must do what we can to support it.
defaultQ67 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultAs I say, Marie Curie 
defaultare
default keen to support you in doing it
default,
default but they are alarmed enough, I think, to say that you should have an organisation
default&#x2011;
defaultwide
default review of how you relate to them. So there must have been some underlying things coming along from the review. But the basic question is still there: what key findings were in the review and what changes do you think we are likely to see as a result of it?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultIn 
defaultthe “Fair Playing F
defaultield
default”
default?
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultYes.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultThere was quite a long list of 29 findings, if I remember correctly.
defaultQ68 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultWhat do you think are the most important?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultThe most important thing is the way commis
defaultsioners go about what they do, t
defaulthe essence, in part, of the section 75 regulations about doing good commissioning, which includes treating all providers fairly, including charitable organisations
default,
default and there are many ways in which charities felt they were not treated entirely fairly
default.
default 
defaultI would
default have to say 
defaultthat 
defaultsometimes
default,
default I think
default,
default it is not reasonable for a commissioner to do what some charities might have wanted, but, equally, I would have said that to the independent sector, to NHS providers
default,
default as well. But there are definitely things that need to change. 
defaultA classic problem is that there are requirements of, say, working capital
default—
defaultvery high levels of working capital, higher than is necessary
default—
defaultwhich a charity just cannot satisfy, so we are working with the commissioner bodies to see what we can do to address those sorts of issues. A more difficult one would be something around, say, the size of contract. Charities will say 
defaultthat 
defaultoften it is difficult for them because, of course, as you will know, many charities are very small organisations
default. T
defaulthey will say it is impossible for them to compete for a contract, to put in a tender for a contract, because it
default is just too big. But I can see
default from a commissioner
default’s point of view 
defaultthat it can be hugely inefficient for them to tender or commission the services that they need in lots of small packets. 
defaultT
defaulthere are inevitable tensions here that have to be worked through and not everyone will be happy with everything
default. B
defaultut there are things we need to look at. The most important for charities, and the whole reason
default for—or 
defaultthe thing that initiated
default—
defaultthe 
default“
defaultFair Playing 
defaultField” review in the first place,
default is the way charities are dealt with from a VAT point of view. The Government eithe
defaultr have, or have said they
default will
default—
defaultI do not know if you know where they have got to, 
defaultbut I think they have agreed—
defaultchange the rules so that the charities are treated like the public sector providers for VAT.
defaultQ69 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultGoing 
defaultback
default to some of the points raised by the BMA, do you have any examples yet of how you are using your role to promote integrated care?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultAs a matter of fact, our duty is not to promote integrated care; it is to enable it. There are different duties across the system. NHS England has to promote it
default,
default and we have to enable it. I think I have that right. There are definitely different duties in different places. Ours is to enable. The reason that ours is to enable rather than promote is because we are not in a position to do much in the way of promotion. It is more about enabling, but pricing is an area where I think we can do things. I do not know, 
defaultAdrian
default, if you want to say a bit about what you are thinking about in pricing.
defaultAdrian Mastersdefault: 
defaultProbably the most important thing we are doing at the moment is making sure we are not a barrier through the pricing system. We are encouraging people out there. We are encouraging
default—
defaultnot just permitting
default—people by
default saying, 
default“
defaultGo and look at new patterns of care, new typ
defaultes of care you want to provide and 
defaultnew integrated care
default,
default and
default,
default if you come
default up with a new pattern of care with 
defaultyour own local prices, that is fine within the rules.
default”
default I would say to the BMA, 
default“
defaultIf you want to work locally to develop a new pattern of care with its own price, go ahead
default. W
defaulte are very happy with that.
default”
default In fact
default, 
defaultone of the reasons we want to encourage it
default 
defaultis because we think there is an opportunity to have this local in
defaultnovation and then learn from it.
default 
defaultW
defaulte would go back later
default,
default have a review and see what has been done and try and share those lessons that have been learne
defaultd. That is the general point. 
defaultPioneers are worth mentioning as well. We are part of the group who are working on the 14 pioneers that the Minister has recently announced. Again, we would help with the selection of the 14 pioneer projects and continue to support those pioneers
default.
default 
defaultI
defaultf what they need is technical support to work out how to do pricing for the model that they are working on, we plan to provide some help and support in that pr
defaultocess. 
defaultThe
defaultre
default 
defaultare 
defaulttwo things I would say on enabling
default: first, we are 
defaulttrying to show we are not putting up barriers, that we are encouraging people to innovate and come up with their own prices
default;
default second
defaultly
default, we are trying to help that process by providing technical expertise and evidence of what is working so that other people can learn from it.
defaultQ70 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultAndrew 
defaultGeorge
default wants to follow that up, but
default,
default before we go there
default,
default can I try to sum up what I think you have said to us about the competition issues this afternoon 
defaultbecause it is quite important? 
defaultI heard you essentially say that these are difficult issues and a lot of people have a lot of views about them, but if the law was better understood there would not be, you believe, a fundamental problem. The reason I sum it up that way is that that is not the evidence that Sir David Nicholson gave to us a fortnight ago
default,
default and nor, if I may say so, is it really the evidence you gave us on 11 June
default,
default when you said, 
default“
defaultThis is one of the absurdities of where we are in danger of finishing up, 
defaultisn’t it—
defaultthat you get a trust going out of business because it has insuperable problems
default,
default trying to fix the problem and not being allowed to fix it because it 
defaultwould reduce competition?”
default It is important to be clear: does the law need changing or not in your view?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultIn many respects, both on the commissioning and the merger stuff, it is about getting a better understanding of the law. But I did raise this very specific point about how you weigh the costs of losing competition against the benefits of going ahead, for e
defaultxample, with a merger. T
defaulthe way the competition authorities think about it is, I think, not taking sufficient account of the way
default that, while
default competit
defaultion in health might lead to improvements, there is 
defaulta danger that the potential benefit
defaults
default of competition
default are overstated
default. Whether fixing that problem requires a change to the law, or whether it is indeed fixable by changing the law, I do not know
default,
default but that is a problem that needs to be fixed. 
defaultQ71 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultAre you aware of
default,
default and do you agree with
default,
default the proposition that this is an issue that is being faced in other health eco
defaultnomies elsewhere in the world? 
defaultI was told recently that this is an issue that has been raised by healthcare providers in the 
defaultUnited States
default and in some other OECD economies, not only in 
defaultAmerica
default, and that the issue of balancing competition against necessary chang
defaulte in a sector which is resource-
defaultconstra
defaultined is faced elsewhere as well.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultYes. That is my understanding, indeed.
defaultQ72 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultWould it, 
defaulttherefore
default, be sensible for this to be addressed as a serious
default—
defaultand, frankly, urgent
default—
defaultissue of policy by Monitor, presumably the TDA, NHS 
defaultEngland
default and the Government
default,
default because you have highlighted an issue which is in danger of making trusts unviable that need not be unviable?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultThis specific issue does need looking at urgently.
defaultChair:default 
defaultThank you. I had wanted to crystallise that because we appeared to be getting different evidence from different witnesses.
defaultQ73 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultI 
defaultwant
default to bridge the discourse between your duty to enable integration and the pricing responsibility of Monitor. I want first of all 
defaultto 
defaultclarify in my own mind that you 
defaultrecognise 
defaultthat 
defaultthere is a potential and very real conflict between the enabling role
default—
defaultto enable integration
default—
defaultand your responsibility to drive out anti
default-
defaultcompetitive practice because certain structures of integration could be deemed by certain providers as a behaviour which is anti
default-
defaultcompetitive. I do not think I need to describe it. If you bundle a lot of things together, there is a risk that someone who might provide one aspect of that service will challenge that as being anti
default-
defaultcompetitive.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultFrankly, there is so much concern and anxiety out there that, even if it was not true, people would fear it is true. 
defaultQ74 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultYou 
defaultcannot
default keep blaming the politicians for raising that.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultNo.
defaultQ75 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultWith
default my colleague Grahame
default, you were
default more or less saying 
defaultthat 
defaultit is the politicians who have created the smokescreen of fear.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultThat was not what I was trying to say. There are all sorts of people engaged in it.
defaultQ76 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultWho
default is?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultI mean engaged in the discussion. 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultOkay
default. W
defaulte will move on.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: Where was I? What was y
defaultour question again, please?
defaultQ77 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultThe conflict. Do you acknowledge there is a conflict is what I am asking?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultYes.
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultThere is a conflict.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: W
defaulte have had our competition experts working with people working on these pioneers precisely to try and give them specific advice and avoid unnecessary or inappropriate concerns.
defaultQ78 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultIs that right, Mr Masters? You have designed some of these pote
defaultntial collections, or at least—I am sorry—
defaultthe environment in which new and innovative models of integration can be developed
default.
defaultAdrian Mastersdefault: 
defaultThe general rule is that
default,
default if a commissioner wants to buy a certain service and that service is a very bundled or 
defaultintegrated service, 
defaultthat is a matter for the commissioner
default. T
defaulthe competition rules a
defaultre not going to get in the way if a commissioner says
default, 
default“
defaultThis is the service I want to buy and it is actually quite integrated.
default”
default There is one issue to do with, 
default“
defaultHow does it interact with choice?
default”
default and
default,
default usually
default,
default if there is a question of the commitment in the constitution that patients will have choice at the point of referral, there need to be mechanisms to handle that. Subject to that one proviso, if the commissioner says, 
default“
defaultThe best service I should commission is a very integrated, large
default&#x2011;
defaultscale service,
default”
default that is a matter for the commissioner. They then have to go through a process of how they do that and then the rules, section 75 and other rules, do apply. We have no picture in our heads of what is the 
defaultright pattern of service that the commissioners should be buying. It is for commissioners to say, 
default“
defaultThis is the pattern or type of service we want to buy or commission.
default”
default We will not get in the way of that.
defaultQ79 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default P
defaultroviding, you are saying, that the opportunity for patient choice remains throughout the pathway.
defaultAdrian Mastersdefault: 
defaultIt is the specific commitment at the point of GP referral
default—“
defaultDo they have choice?
default”—
defaultthat they have to answer. But that is in the constitution.
defaultQ80 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Sharma:default 
defaultWhat if the commissioner 
defaultsays
default, 
default“
defaultNo, this is your choice. With the services we are buying
default, your choice does not fit in.”? T
defaulthen where does patient choice go?
defaultAdrian Mastersdefault: 
defaultThe current situation is 
defaultthat 
defaultthe commissioner has to answer the question as to how they are going to give the patient the commitment in the NHS constitution of how they are getting choice at the point of GP referral for those particular services that they are meant to get choice for. They could say, 
default“
defaultYou have a choice of going on to this integrated package of care or going to one of these other providers.
default” That is totally fine, 
defaultbut
default,
default at the moment
default,
default they have to meet the constitutional commitment that patients are going to have a choice at the point of GP referral. 
defaultO
defaultther than that, the pattern of services that the commissioners buy is a point for the commissioner
defaults
default to work out as to what is best.
defaultQ81 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultSo if at the point of GP referral the patient is offered an integrated pathway of care or an alternative which might mean that they can select other services of their own design
default—
default 
defaultAdrian Mastersdefault: 
defaultThey could go to another provider, yes.
defaultAndrew George: defaultTo
default provide for their, say, long
default&#x2011;
defaultterm care for arthritis, or whatever it may be, they can make that choice. 
defaultAdrian Mastersdefault: 
defaultYes. 
defaultQ82 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultIn relation to the setting now of the pricing policy, which you say is going to look pretty much the same in 2014
default&#x2011;
default15 as it does now
default—
defaultI think that is what you were saying in your evidence
default—
default 
defaultAdrian Mastersdefault: 
defaultYes.
defaultQ83 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultBut just on the principle of it, if your role is to drive out anti
default-
defaultcompetitive practice, one of the criticisms of the existing pricing policy is that it creates an unfair playing field between, for example, providers of general hospitals and those, for example, private pr
defaultoviders that can provide elective
default surgeries that effective
defaultly cherry
default&#x2011;
defaultpick
default the easier
default&#x2011;
defaultto
default&#x2011;
defaultdo
default or the lower co
default&#x2011;
defaultmorbidity
default procedures which that general hospital provides. This is a general theme that I am sure you are well aware
default of and the payment-by-results—
defaultthe tariff
default—system 
defaultcurrently enables that to happen. That is not something which the Act 
defaulth
defaultas created. It has been happening for some time and I acknowledge that. To what extent, first, do you acknowledge 
defaultthat that might be the case,
default and, second
defaultly
default, 
defaultdo
default you believe it is possible to create a tariff structure which might fairly reflect the fact that some providers need to ensure they have a wraparound of intensive care and other support services
default,
default which the private sector depend
defaults
default on if things go wrong?
defaultAdrian Mastersdefault: 
defaultIn the pricing system
default,
default a certain kind of bundle of care is specified in the things that we price. If the commissioner locally wants to bu
defaulty that, plus some other add
default&#x2011;
defaultons—such as rehabilitation—
defaultthat 
defaultare
default no
defaultt included in the local bundle, 
defaultthat is a matter for the commissioner. The commissioner has flexibility in the pricing system to negotiate and change the price. I just wanted to make the point that there is a lot of flexibility in the system for the commissioner locally. So in the usual bundle, for which there is a usual price, that assumes a mix of patients with different types and degrees of complexity. If the commissioner feels, 
default“
defaultI am not actually sending the patients with that full range of complexity to this local provider,
default”
default again the commissioner can negotiate and agree a lower price because 
default“
defaultI am not sending you all the people assumed in that bundle. I am sending you less complicated ones so I want a lower price.
default”
default That is totally open for the commissioner to negotiate with the
default—
default 
defaultQ84 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultThat is the 
defaultcommissioner
default, not yourselves and NHS England.
defaultAdrian Mastersdefault: 
defaultNot us because we do not know what pattern of service they are buying. But if they want to vary it from the national standard, they can go ahead and do that and agree a different price. 
defaultSo t
defaulthat covers most of the cases where people talk about cherry
default&#x2011;
defaultpicking
default. The one area that is left is people say
default—
defaultand we are looking at the moment to see if we can find evidence for this
default—
defaultthat they are more likely to make a surplus on elective care than they are on other types of care. Therefore, they are saying if some of the elective care is going elsewhere, 
default“Without t
defaulthat surp
defaultlus, 
defaultwe can no longer cross
default&#x2011;
defaultsubsidise
default other parts of our service.
default”
default This is 
defaultthe 
defaultother term that people point to. The way we come up with the prices is we get people to report the cost of those services to us. They take their total cost
defaults
default and allocate them to all their services, including elective care. What they are saying
default,
default in the way that the costs have been allocated, 
defaultis, “
defaultWe have not allocated all the rig
defaultht costs to this elective care, s
defaulto we are not being paid the right amount.
default”
default 
defaultOver time, we need to 
defaultimprove the quality of the costing
default,
default so that the prices more accurately reflect the cost
defaults
default. That
default,
default again
default,
default is an exercise we have started working on 
defaultas to 
defaulthow we can get better costing information and better reflect the cost in the prices. 
defaultQ85 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultYou are in a very 
defaultprivileged
default position because, particularly with those foundation trusts that are in financial difficulty, you will be analysing and looking at the cost centres of the various departments, and no doubt procedures and so on, and recognising that there will be certain services which they need to have in place, intensive care services
default,
default accident and emergency services, anaes
defaultthesia and so on, which provide
default across a whole range of departments which 
defaultare
default not in 
defaultthemselves
default easy to apportion to one particular procedure, for example. It may well be in those services that there are potential losses and, therefore, in an acute trust
default,
default they are seeking to make a surplus through elective activity in order to balance the books. How are they going to balance the books? Are you saying that they should be charging a great deal more for some of their core services f
defaultor which there is not a payment-by-
defaultresults 
defaultsystem
default? 
defaultAdrian Mastersdefault: 
defaultI will have a shot at an answer
default,
default and if I am not answering the right question, let me know. The way we come up with the prices is that we take the costs from the pr
defaultoviders, they report it to us, 
defaultreport it against the services that they have provided and we calculate an average
default. T
defaulthat, based on that average, is what we pay. 
defaultT
defaulthey should be getting a payment for the services covered by the tariff which reflect
defaults
default the costs of a reasonably efficient provider because it is based on the average. So
default,
default 
defaultfor 
defaultmost of t
defaulthose services that they provide,
default they are getting paid a price based on what it would cost an average provider. That is a reasonable way to go about it. They do have other sources. Depending on how you calculate the average, somewhere between 60% and 70% of acute hospital income is provided through 
defaulttariff. For some providers it is more
default;
default some it is less, depending on what other mix of revenue they have. 
defaultI
defaultf you have R and D, for example, or teaching revenue, it is lower
default,
default and if you do not have that
default,
default it is higher. We do not tr
defaulty, in the national system, to fine tune
default every individual provider
default’
defaults match between their revenue and cost. 
defaultW
defaulte set reasonable national prices and then there is flexibility at the local level for the commissioner and the provider to make other payments based on their local situation to reflect the local cost.
defaultQ86 default&#xa0; 
defaultGrahame M. Morris:default 
defaultIf it is opportune, could I ask about the changes that came into effect this year on the marginal rate and what impact you think that has had, particularly in relation to emergency admissions?
defaultAdrian Mastersdefault: 
defaultAs to the marginal rate rule, shall I say a little bit about what it is before I start?
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultYes.
defaultAdrian Mastersdefault: 
defaultBack in 2001
default&#x2011;
default02, 03 and 04 for emergency admissions people were paid a block grant, a block amount, and we had relatively low growth in emergency admissions. Round about 2004
default&#x2011;
default05
default,
default we introduced a 98% A and E target
default,
default and a little later on we started paying people for emergency admissions. For every extra emergency admission, you got an extra payment. We had a very rapid growth in emergency admissions. We were paying for every extra one and you had the target. Over a period of time, six or seven years, it grew about 7% a year. 
defaultWe could not afford for it to continue to be growing at that rate, so in about 2010
default&#x2011;
default11 
defaultwe 
defaultwent back, essentially, to a budget. 
defaultW
defaulte went back to a budget base and then saw a slow
default&#x2011;
defaultdown
default in the rate of growth of emergency admissions. That was done in 2010
default&#x2011;
default11
default,
default and the basic rule has been unchanged since the
defaultn. It has been 2010
default&#x2011;
default11, 2011
default&#x2011;
default12 and
default 2012
default&#x2011;
default13
default,
default and the new rule we are putting forward has not changed from that. It is a continuation of the rules we have had since 2010
default&#x2011;
default11. 
defaultI
defaultt has had this effect of slowing the rate of growth in emergency admissions
default.
default 
defaultW
defaulte are worried that if we change it by paying more for every emergency admission 
defaultwe
default would again see an acceleration of emergency admissions
default,
default and we think that is a bad way
default to run it
default. We have a fixed NHS budget and we do not think it is good value to be spending more of our budget on extra emergency admissions. 
defaultW
defaulte want to keep that budget control at the hospital level over growth in emergency admissions. Instead
default,
default we want t
defaulto spend any money that we have—
defaultany flexibil
defaultity that we have on the margin—
defaulton out
default&#x2011;
defaultof
default&#x2011;
defaulthospital
default care, trying to keep people supported and well
default,
default rather than being admitted to hospital
default,
default and have better schemes for discharging them after they have been in hospital. 
defaultT
defaulthe marginal rate does two things. One, it basically applies this budget control over growth in emergency admissions but it also puts money into a pot
default. F
defaultor
default any admissions over the budget, t
defaulthe commissioner has to put money into a pot
default,
default and that money is intended 
defaultor planned to be spent
default on how to avoid further admissions and how to do a better job of helping people be discharged from hospital. So that basic structure
default—
default 
defaultQ87 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultFrom the point of 
defaultview
default of the acute hospital m
defaultanager, they would have to know.
defaultAdrian Mastersdefault: 
defaultThe question was
default,
default 
default“
defaultHas it changed?
default”
default and I was trying to say it has not; it is still the same.
defaultQ88 default&#xa0; 
defaultGrahame M. Morris:default 
defaultI was trying to get your assessment of whether it had worked, given that the Secretary of State has announced £250 million of additiona
defaultl resource.
defaultAdrian Mastersdefault: 
defaultI will come back to the Secretary of State. Yes, broadly speaking, I think the marginal rate 
defaultrule
default has done th
defaulte kind of job we wanted it to. 
defaultWe have made some changes to try and do it
default better, but it has done two things. I
defaultt has helped control the rate of growth in emergency admissions
default,
default and it has directed attention by commissioners and providers in how they can work together to keep people well and supported outside hospital and to discharge them better once they have been in hospital. So, in terms of directing that attention and working together on that and of controlling growth of emergency admissions, particularly short
default&#x2011;
defaultstay
default emergency admissions, it has been helpful to the process.
default 
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultCan I add, th
defaultough, it does have two problems?
default The first is, while it has incentivised hospitals to reduce the rate of growth in admissions, there are clearly problems if there are unavoidable admissions and they are not getting paid enough for them. That is an issue.
defaultStephen Haydefault: W
defaulte have had some FTs get into financial difficulties.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultYes, and we have trusts in difficulty because of that. The second problem is that
default, if that
default 70% 
defaultwhich
default is held back from the hospital is not being spent effectively to either prevent attendance at A and E in the first place or to get them out once their treatment is complete, then you have further pressure on the hospitals
default,
default and I think 
defaultmost of us would 
defaultagree that it is not all being spent as effectively as we would like
default. 
defaultSo there are problems.
defaultQ89 default&#xa0; 
defaultGrahame M. Morris:default 
defaultAre 
defaultyou
default going to look at that again?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultAdrian and his team have already made some proposed changes for 2014
default&#x2011;
default15, but it needs a more thorough examination. Our problem is always
default—and 
defaultthis is the whole problem with the pricing system
default—
defaultthat
default,
default if you tinker with individual things
default,
default you can improve this and make that worse at the same time
default,
default and when there is only so much money to go round you have to be very careful about how you do that. So we have made limited changes for 2014
default&#x2011;
default15
default,
default but we need to look at how we are going to try and get this to work better in the long term.
defaultQ90 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultHas there 
defaultbeen
default some sense of looking at the impact around this? You were talking about one set of levers, but surely at the same time £2.68 billion has gone out of adult social care and that clearly plays into this. You are talking about both avoidable admissions and people being able to be discharged. My own local authority is going through a situation of changing to substantial eligibility across this winter, which I am sure will have an impact, but there is a frustration that I feel
default—
defaultand certainly we feel on the Committee
default—
defaultthat this is never looked at and these connections are never made. I do not know if you or somebody could commission it, but it seems to me that we are missing a trick in never looking at what
default happens in the three, six or 
default12 months after a social care authority has change
defaultd its situation, cut its budget and changed its eligibility,
default and the impact of that on the hospitals that usually fall into 
defaultthe
default catchment area of that authority. We are in the lucky situation, I suppose, of being able to do these comparisons because we have 152 separate social care authorities that can make their own decisions, but it is not entirely within the things you have just been talking about. It is that plus the surrounding
default—
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultI totally agree. Of course, you are getting to the heart of the challenges presented by the fact that social care and health
default 
defaultcare are separate. 
defaultQ91 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultBut they are and have been.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultYes. It certainly would not be true to say people are not worrying about it
default.
default 
defaultO
defaultne of the things that, hopefully, will come out of this integratio
defaultn transformation fund, the ITF—
defaultwhich is £1.8 billion at the moment and will be £3.8 billion from 2015
default&#x2011;
default16, 
defaultand 
defaultthat is why this extra £2 billion is
default going out of the acute sector—is 
defaultat least 
defaultthat 
defaultit is being spent in a way that is intended to get more effective co
default&#x2011;
defaultordination between health and social care
default.
default 
defaultQ92 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultBut can I stop you? We had a rather depressing set of panels on this last week. The person from the Nuffield Trust was saying that the planning was nowhere near where it should be for that
default,
default and
default,
default when 
defaultwe 
defaultspoke to the LGA health and wellbeing people in the afternoon, effectively they said
default,
default 
default“T
defaulthey are talking,
default”
default that they have relationships. Integration will not be at a point of working well enough to be the powerful lever it could be if that is the state of play at the minute. There was a very strong view that came over from the Nuffield Trust that the level of planning that we need to properly use that extra £1.8 billion was not there and that it is effectively just at talking level, relationship
default&#x2011;
defaultbuilding
default level. There is very serious planning that needs to be being done now and it is not being done.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultI certainly agree that it needs to be done very serio
defaultusly. This is outside our remit
default 
defaultand 
defaultthis is
default—
default 
defaultQ93 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultBut you are a player in this.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultWe certainly see the consequences because of the impact it has on our trusts, so we are certainly strongly encouraging that there is this better co
default&#x2011;
defaultordination.
defaultQ94 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultBut there 
defaultis
default no point in hoping, given the evidence we have, that this is going to work itself through because it does not sound as if it is. Taking that £2.6 billion out of social care means taking people out of social care as well. My local authority has a real dearth of senior people now. How that all gets dealt with is difficult because they are both having to go through the difficult thing of making cuts as well as having cuts themselves and having fewer managers and senior managers.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultI agree. I have very few levers to do anything about this particular issue, but 
defaultI 
defaultcompletely agree that it is an issue.
defaultQ95 default&#xa0; 
defaultGrahame M. Morris:default 
defaultWhile we are in this section, I wonder if I might ask you a question about mental health and the Mental Health Act and how the tariffs apply there. You might be aware that the Committee did a post
default&#x2011;
defaultlegislative
default scrutiny inquiry on the 2007 Act
default,
default and the general conclusion was that it would be beneficial if there was a tariff for mental health service
defaults because the block contracting-
defaultin grant for mental health services makes it easier to cut. I wonder where we stood with that because it seems as if there are some reports that that is on hold and 
defaultthat 
defaultit may not happen. Could you give us some clarification?
defaultAdrian Mastersdefault: 
defaultWhat has happened in mental health is they have defined the services they provide into 21 clusters. They are going through a process of collecting activity, cost and setting quality indicators against each of those clusters. The kind of cluster
default might be people with psychosis,
default and you might say people with relatively mild psychosis, medium psychosis 
defaultand very severe psychosis. That is the kind of thing they would call a cluster
default—
default21 of those. In order to get to the point
default where you can specify a tariff,
default you 
defaultneed to have consistency of,
default 
default“
defaultWithin this block we have the same p
defaulteople—record the same patients.” T
defaulto set one number, one tariff, we need to say we have similar kind
defaults
default of costs
default—
defaulthow much it c
defaultosts to treat a patient with the same 
defaultdesignation. 
defaultIf you talk to people in the sector, the
defaulty are
default finally going through this process of allocating their patients into these clusters
default. T
defaulthey are collecting information about activity
default and
default cost, they are looking at quality indicators and then they are talking to their peers about variation. They are finding 
defaultit, I think, very helpful
default to reflect on their own practice and how it differs from others. The other thing they are finding is that there is not great consistency with any of these clusters about what does happen to a patient with a particular diagnosis because clinical practice varies an awful lot in mental health. You might have the same patient with post
default&#x2011;
defaulttraumatic
default distress 
defaultdis
defaultorder and different clinicians will put them 
defaulton different types of treatment
default programmes. Therefore
default, the cost
default, 
defaultwhen you look at how much it has
default cost for that particular condition, varies 
defaultvery
default widely. So we think it is going to be quite a while
default—
defaultand I think this is also the international evidence
default—
defaultbefore we can agree
default,
default for this particular kind of patient, 
default“
defaultHere is a national price that we think should be paid.
default”
default 
defaultInstead
default,
default what we are doing is encouraging people to use these clusters, increase their understanding of their activity and their clinical practice, 
defaultincrease their 
defaultunderstanding
default of
default the quality of the results they are getting and then 
defaultto 
defaultnegotiate locally as to prices. 
defaultW
defaulte are saying to them, 
default“
defaultYou should use those clusters as the basis of your local price negotiation with your local commissioners about how much you are going to be paid. 
defaultU
defaultse y
defaultour clusters, negotiate locally and
default build your und
defaulterstanding of what is going on; 
defaultcost activity and quality.
default”
default 
defaultIt is going to be quite a while—perhaps a very long time—
defaultbefore we can say 
defaultthat 
defaultwe know enough to say, 
default“
defaultThis is the right treatment and, therefore, this is the right price.
default”
defaultQ96 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultA segmented 
defaultblock
default contract.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultThat is the sort of first step.
defaultAdrian Mastersdefault: 
defaultYes. It is a cost
default-
defaultvolume contract against these segments, yes.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultIt is trying to find a pragmatic way through a very difficult problem.
defaultChair:default Indeed.
defaultQ97 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault: defaultCan I take you now to the new regulatory framework that has just come into play on 1 October, the risk assessment framework? Are you aware of some of the criticisms that have come out from the Foundation Trust Network about this new framework?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultI think
default&#xa0;
defaultwe are.
defaultQ98 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultWhat 
defaultwould
default you say to that?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultWhat specific criticisms are you highlighting?
defaultQ99 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultThey 
defaultseem
default to think that it is more interventionist, that basically what you are doing is measuring them as against performance targets as opposed to anything else.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultI will pass to Stephen in a moment, but I want to come back to a point I made earlier
default,
default which is 
defaultthat 
defaultit is all about the length of the arm between us and the trusts. While the legislation establishes, in principle
default—
defaultand this is going back to 2004 legislation and then reinforced by 2006, I think
default—
defaultthat the foundation trusts should be autonomous bodies with a relatively arm
default’
defaults length relationship with us
default,
default as the sort of 
default“
defaultshareholder
default”
default on behalf of the public and Parliament, nevertheless you could have very different lengths of arms and still be consistent with the legislation. My predecessors, although Adrian and Stephen were involved in this, settled on a relationship with a degree of scrutiny and so on. I think, partly as a result of the increasing pressure on the system and partly as a result, I frankly think, of the public and Parliament having a lower risk appetite than the
defaulty did back in 2004, in general—
defaultbut we have seen it in the financial services
default sector as a very good example—
defaultfor both of those reasons
default,
default my view is that we need a somewhat shorter arm and that is what the FTN is reflecting. Whether we have it right or not, to some extent
default,
default everyone will always disagree. Some will say it is still not short enough, and I get plenty of people telling me that, and the FTN will say it needs to be even longer still.
default That is the challenge we face—
defaultfinding what is the right length of that arm.
defaultQ100 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultAre you satisfied that with what you have in place now you would be able to do that?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultWe have consulted on the risk assessment framework. Although there were some objections, there were never an overwhelming set of obj
defaultections to any of our proposals.
default 
defaultAs to the length of the arm, we have to be
default pragmatic. It is where we feel it is about right. If the evidence is, for example, 
defaultthat 
defaultwe are having a lot of trusts fail and we are not either spotting it soon enough or not doing enough about it, we are going to have to shorten it a bit more. 
defaultStephen Haydefault: 
defaultIt has only been in
default for
default six weeks, so we have limited experience. Certainly
default,
default on the financial side
default,
default we are running what are called shadow continuity of service ratings and they are not demonstrating a greater number of trusts hitting the threshold for investigation on financial issues than under the old compliance framework. On the non
default&#x2011;
defaultfinancial
default side, the old compliance framework had 
defaultbecome
default very complicated and you almost needed a PhD to understand how it operated. We have simplified it. We have 
defaultreflected a lot of the learning
default coming out of Mid Staffordshire and some of the leading indicators around
default patient surveys, staff surveys and
default the quality governance framework in it to, as David says, pick up those issues at an earlier stage. But I think we are going to have to see how it plays out over the next year.
defaultQ101 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultThat is what their concern was, that, coming out of Mid Staffordshire, you were going to become more interventionist as a result of what happened there. Are you saying that you are not more interventionist?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultThere are two stages to this. There is how closely do we monitor them and then how quickly and strongly do we intervene when we have reason to be concerned. So we are monitoring a different set of measures, but I do not think it is any more
default—
defaultQ102 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultCould
default you say what those sets of measures are?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultIt is things that Stephen suggested. One
default lesson
default from Mid Staffordshire is that 
defaultthere 
defaultwere lots of signals out there and somehow no one said, 
default“
defaultThere is a pattern here. There must be a problem behind it.
default”
default We are trying to look at the sort of softer intelligence. 
defaultStephen Haydefault: 
defaultIt is the soft intelligence. 
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultYes, things like staff surveys and patient surveys that might be good indicators of underlying problems that others have not found. 
defaultT
defaulthat is one of the sorts of changes we have made. In other areas
default,
default we have taken things out and tried to simplify it. I do not think the monitoring regime has fundamentally changed the length of the arm. We have changed the character of the arm to try and make it better
default—in particular,
default better at spotting things. Then there is the question of 
defaulth
defaultow quickly and strongly we intervene
default.
default I would say we are trying to intervene a bit faster and a bit more strongly
default,
default and that is because the system is under a lot of pressure and we cannot afford to have lots of seriously failing hospitals out there.
defaultStephen Haydefault: 
defaultThe other thing that is worth saying, David, is that I know the FTN are quite concerned about the proposals that we have to look at governance every three years, but that is simply because we find that
default,
default whenever we have a problem in a foundation trust that becomes a serious problem
default,
default where we have to step in, whether it is finance or quality, underneath it there are governance failings. The concept of doing a governance review on a rolling basis is to help the boards and us 
defaultto 
defaultidentify where those failings are coming before we see the problems coming out in quality or financial failings. 
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultIf I may so, this is a perfect example. As Stephen says, we have refined our ability to even measure governance for an applicant trust. 
defaultF
defaultrankly, we measure it better now than many of the FTs were measured when they went through. Even those that were good may have declined
default,
default and, as Stephen says, often
default,
default when we find a trust getting into serious difficulty
default,
default it is because their governance is not fit for purpose. We could just sit and wait until they get into serious difficulty and then find out their governance is not fit for purpose, but the 
defaultpatients are already suffering 
defaultbecause 
defaultthe trust is
default already delivering poor
default-
defaultquality care. 
defaultW
defaulthat we are saying is 
defaultthat 
defaultwe would like every trust, every board, to have a review of its governance at least every three years
default,
default so that it is more likely that the problems will be identified and sorted
default out
default, 
defaultso that 
defaultthe underlying governance issues are sorted out before they become real problems for the quality of care. That is something where the FTN might say, 
default“
defaultNo, it is up to trusts whether they review their governance on a regular basis or not,
default”
default and that is where we say, 
default“W
defaulte have done it on a 
default‘
defaultcomply or explain
default’
default basis.
default”
default We have said
default,
default 
default“
defaultThis is what we expect. If you do not do it, you should at least explain why you are not doing it.
default”
default 
defaultQ103 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultDo 
defaultyou
default feel that the regime you have now will prevent another Mid Staffordshire or 
defaultMorecambe
default 
defaultBay
default?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultThe most important change
default—
default 
defaultQ104 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultThat is, 
defaulth
defaultow long 
defaultis a 
defaultpiece of string?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultY
defaultou can never say, never, can you? B
defaultut the most important change that makes a Mid Staffordshire
default,
default and indeed a 
defaultMorecambe
default 
defaultBay
default,
default less likely are the changes going on with the CQC
default.
default Morecambe Bay I think illustrates this. When we were assessing 
defaultMorecambe
default 
defaultBay
default for FT status we spotted that there was a pattern of worrying SUIs
default—
defaultserious untoward incidents
default—
defaultin particular in maternity
default. S
defaulto we stopped our assessment and said to the CQC, 
default“
defaultCan you go and have a look because we are not sure there is not a problem here,
default”
default and 
defaulteventually they came back and said, 
default“
defaultNo, it is fine.
default”
default 
defaultWell, it was not,
default and the new inspection regime that the CQC is putting in place
default,
default I hope
default,
default will make sure that does not happen again.
defaultQ105 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultThat leads me lastly on to the next area. The Select Committee and Robert Francis in his seminal work on Mid Staffordshire both said that 
defaultthere should not be two of you—CQC and Monitor—
defaultbut you think there should be. Could you explain why? 
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultFirst, I should say that that is a decision, ultimately, for the Government. However, I do share the Government
default’
defaults view that merging the two organisations would not be the right thing to do. That is for two fundamental reasons. First of all, if you were starting from scratch and there was no CQC and no Monitor and you were asking, 
default“
defaultHow do you regulate this sector?
default”
default there is an argument, I absolutely accept, for saying you will draw a dividing line between the two organisations in a different place to where it is today and maybe even just have one organisation. You could make that argument
default;
default I would not. I would say that, while that would provide some benefits, there is a huge merit in separating the body that says whether or not care is good enough from the body whose job it is to sort it out. Similarly, I think there is huge merit in separating the body that looks at the quality of care from the body that has to worry about whether the finances of a trust are in good order. This is as I said before: whenever we have a trust in difficulty, the first thing that we care about is getting the quality fixed and then we will sort the finances out. So
default,
default even with a blank sheet of paper, I personally would keep them separate. However, we do not have a blank sheet of paper. We have two organisations, both of which have been going through
default—
defaultor, in the case of the CQC, still are going through
default—
defaulta lot of change
default,
default and I think the last thing you would need is to add to that the complexity and challenges of putting the two together. Indeed, you could argue that some of the challeng
defaultes that the CQC has
default faced have been a consequence of the fact that it was three separate organisations put together and 
defaultthat 
defaultit is a challenging thing to do. I would not do it for that reason. 
defaultQ106 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultYes, and I 
defaultsuppose
default you would say that, would you not? It is like turkeys waiting for Christmas: why would you want to do yourself out of a job? Clearly, if you look at your evidence it seems to be littered with, 
default“
defaultWe are chatting with,
default” “
defaultWe are developing our relationship,
default”
default and 
default“
defaultWe are talking to.
default”
default So you are working together anyway, are
defaultn’t
default you?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultWe are most certainly working together. I hope I have put forward
default—
defaultQ107 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultThere
default is no reason, is there, 
defaultwhy it could not evolve into somethi
defaultng different, perhaps 
defaultsomething more cost
default&#x2011;
defaulteffective?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultI hope I put forward a cogent argument as to why I do not think it is right rather than just 
defaulta purely self
default&#x2011;
defaultinterested one. 
defaultOn the issue of working together, that is very important and we do work extremely closely together
default,
default at all sorts of levels. I have a conversation with David Behan probably every week. People in Stephen
default’
defaults organisation are talking to their opposite numbers in 
defaultthe 
defaultCQC daily and sometimes hourly where there are problems in particular at trusts. 
defaultI
defaultt is absolutely essential that we work closely together. I
default don’t think i
defaultt would
default 
default be right to assume that you can never have a single organisation where you have two divisions that do not have problems working together. So just because we are two separate organisations does not mean to say that we have to work together badly. I think we work together well. 
defaultQ108 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultThat is right. I am not suggesting anything about the quality of your work. I am just suggesting about how you do it and you ha
defaultve memorandums of understanding. 
defaultSomething else was th
defaultrown at you
default 
defaultlike a curved ball
default out of Francis, which the Government put forward, and that is the chief inspectors. 
defaultT
defaulthat 
defaulti
defaults something new that you are working with. How does that fit into what you do? 
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultThat is all part of what I very much welcome, which is this 
defaultmore hands
default&#x2011;
defaulton, specialist, feet-on-the-
defaultground inspection regime that the CQC is adopting. You mentioned 
defaultMorecambe
default 
defaultBay
default and it illustrates this
default. When
default,
default after
default we authorised Morecambe Bay
default on the basis that the CQC felt the care was all right and then it became clear over 11 months la
defaultter that it was not, we asked 
defaultCentral Manchester 
defaultUniversity Hospitals NHS 
defaultF
defaultoundation 
defaultT
defaultrust
default to 
defaultsend their maternity people—who are real experts—in 
defaulton the ground to look at what was going on
default, t
defaulthey were the ones who found the underlying problems. To my mind, that absolutely illustrates why you need real experts on the ground. So this new inspection regime, which was developed in
defaultitially by Bruce Keogh in his 14 reviews 
defaultand now Mike is picking it up, is exactly the right way to go. I entirely welcome it.
defaultQ109 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultCan I ask you 
defaultone
default more thing before we move on to the last 
defaultpoint
default? We 
defaultwere only
default given this today 
defaultwhen
default it was put before us. You have a list of all the updated staff. Given what Robert Francis said, are you not surprised
default that
default, or perhaps you can explain why, 
defaultunder “Patient &amp; Clinical E
defaultngagement
default” there was not anything
default?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultYes. One of the things that I am very clear about is that
default,
default although we draw heavily on external experts for advice on clinical aspects of much of what we do, we need more people with clinical backgrounds inside Monitor. My starting point for that is to appoint a medical director to run 
defaultthe
default unit that you mention. I have had a problem in that I know who I want to appoint and have known for many months
default,
default but 
defaultI 
defaulthave had a problem getting the terms and conditions of that appointment agreed. That is why that unit is not yet established.
defaultQ110 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultOkay. How 
defaultbig
default would the unit be?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultOne of the things we have said is that we want the incoming medical directo
defaultr to work with us to design it, s
defaulto the exact size remains to be determined. What we will finish up doing is having a relatively small unit
default—
defaultlet me say between 10 and 20 people
default—
defaultbut drawing heavily on real experts out there in the NHS. 
defaultQ111 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultWhat exactly 
defaultwould
default they do?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultThere are the two roles: there is clinical engagement and patient engagement. On clinical engagement
default,
default we need a number of in
default&#x2011;
defaulthouse clinical experts like the medical director and then I want them to reach out to clinical experts
default across the NHS, including the r
defaultoyal colleges, for example, and there are two thi
defaultngs that they need to do for us. O
defaultne is to bring genuine specific technical knowledge, clinical knowledge, to our decision making, and we have touched on those sorts of issues several times in the course of this afternoon
default. T
defaulthe second thing I want them to do, which at th
defaulte
default moment mostly I and one or two other colleagues are doing, is to reach out to the clinicians as important stakeholders for all the things that need to happen in the NHS. If you take an example of the work that is going on at Mid Staffordshire to work out how to find a long
default&#x2011;
defaultterm solution there, we have clinical people leading that work
default,
default but they and us together have reached out to the Academy of Medical 
defaultRoyal Colleges to help us work out what the clinical solution should be there
default,
default and we have had a
defaultn enormous amount of help from 
defaultTerence Stephenson and his people. I want to do this more ofte
defaultn, more regularly, on a broader base, so that we can
default establish strong ties with the clinicians in the health sector.
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultThank you very much.
defaultQ112 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultCan I pursue the point 
defaultabout
default the medical director because you have made it clear for some months that you want to have a medical director in your senior executive team. Where is the hold
default&#x2011;
defaultup?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultThere are Government processes and rules around
default—
defaultQ113 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultHow many months is it since you fi
defaultrst put this proposal, presumably 
defaultto the Department?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: I
defaultt is probably about 
defaultthree
default’
defaultish
default.
defaultQ114 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default “
defaultIsh
default”?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultThree or four.
defaultChair:default 
defaultIt is a subject the Committee might wish to pursue. To have one of the major regulators in the field
default,
default with you as chair and chief executive
default,
default wanting a medical director and not 
defaulthaving one appointed
default I would have thought is something that my colleagues may wish to pursue.
defaultQ115 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultI must 
defaultadmit
default 
defaultthat 
defaultI have written down
default,
default 
default“M
defaultedical
default director—knows who it would be. H
defaultow long will you wait to get the terms agreed?
default”
default What is the problem? You cannot not have clinicians right at the heart of what you are doing. How many people are suffering because of that?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultI hope they are not suffering. We are, of course, able to reach out and get people to help us, but it is not quite the same as having a few people and a senior person in charge of them in
default&#x2011;
defaulthouse.
defaultChair:default 
defaultThe case makes itself, frankly.
defaultQ116 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultIt does
default,
default 
defaultand
default can I also say that, 
defaultas a chair who has done a board-to-
defaultboard with Monitor, one of the things you would be telling me is
default,
default 
default“Hope is not a strategy,”
default so hoping is not going to get this sorted out.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultYes, and indeed I am doing more than hoping. 
defaultChair:default 
defaultBy raising it here possibly. 
defaultQ117 default&#xa0; 
defaultGrahame M. Morris:default 
defaultCan
default I
default—
default 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultAre you following on that point?
defaultGrahame M. Morris:default 
defaultIt is kind of related to that. It is separate but linked to it, so if you want to finish that, I will follow. 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultI was going to go on to re
defaultgulatory processes in non
default&#x2011;
defaultacute
default trusts
default stuff. 
defaultGrahame M. Morris:default 
defaultIt is kind of related to that
default, too
default. In terms 
defaultof the budget and the emphasis—
defaultyou mentioned the need to have a medical director
default,
default and
default,
default for those trusts that are put in special measures
default, 
defaultwe have read your ev
defaultidence of the teams that go in—
defaultthere seems to be a very large percentage of Monitor
default’
defaults budget, and this is the annual accountability hearing, that goes into management consultants. I think it is of the order of 40%. How do you account for that
default,
default given that the general rhetoric from Government is to rely less on external management consultants and develop in
default&#x2011;
defaulthouse talent 
defaultthat
default is more cost
default&#x2011;
defaulteffective and expertise that is relevant from within service? 
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultYes. 
defaultS
defaultometimes I think it is a mistake
default that t
defaulthey get labe
defaultlled as management consultants as 
defaultoften they are accountancy firms and not doing traditional management consultancy
default. B
defaultut
default they are external to Monitor and t
defaulthere are two reasons we use them. One is because we need expertise which it would make no sense at all to have permanently in
default&#x2011;
defaulthouse. That would cost us more because we do not need 
defaultthat expertise
default very often
default,
default and
default,
default if we had them permanently on our books, even though they would cost less each per day, the total costs over the course of a year, or several years, would be much more. So it is partly about dealing with that. 
defaultThe second reason
default—
defaultand particularly over the last few years
default—
defaultis that
default,
default as we have been tak
defaulting on our new role, inevitably, 
defaultit is taking us a while to build our new organisation and there is a limit to how fast we have been able to recruit people. 
defaultF
defaultor example, we have increased by 62% the number of people in Monitor over the last year
default,
default and I can tell you that 
defaultt
defaulth
defaultat h
defaultas been one enormous recruitment effort and has been very challenging. But we could not wait until we had completed the recruitment before we took on these responsibilities
default,
default because Parliament very kindly gave them to us straight away. 
defaultW
defaulte have been using consultants in part to make up for that gap. So
default,
default although we have
default increased the size of Monitor—
defaultthe numbe
defaultr of people working in Monitor—by 62% over the 
default12 months since I was last here, our total budget has gone up by something less than 10%. The reason for that is that, of course, once you recruit people and have them in
default&#x2011;
defaulthouse
default,
default they are much cheaper than having to outsource. 
defaultStephen Haydefault: 
defaultOne 
defaultthing
default that illustrates David
default’
defaults first point is that my team have to run the annual planning review where we look at every plan of every one of the 147 foundation trusts. 
defaultT
defaulthat has to be done in about a two
default&#x2011;
defaultmonth
default period in May, June and July and there is no way that we have the staff to do that and then do the follow
default&#x2011;
defaulton work. There is 
defaulta 
defaultmassive spike in work that has to be done in those two or three months 
defaultsuch 
defaultthat we have to buy it in because there would not be anything for them to do for the other 10 months of the year.
defaultQ118 default&#xa0; 
defaultGrahame M. Morris:default 
defaultI know time is limited and we have had votes and so on, but particularly in relation to the South London Healthcare NHS Trust, 
defaultand 
defaultI do not know who footed the bill, it cost £5 million, did it not, for the review and there were criticisms about cost, the accuracy of the projections and about the level of expertise of the management consultants that were engaged to do that?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultSouth London
default was a DH/Trust Development Authority issue because they were not FTs, but we have used consultants
default—by “
defaultconsultants
default” I mean
default external bodies, contractors
default—
defaultas the special administrators in Mid Staffordshire
default,
default and, yes, it does cost a lot of money. Partly
default,
default that is because you are trying to do things as fast as you can
default,
default but it is also very complex. One of the things they spent enormous amounts of resources
default on
default, and therefore 
defaultmoney, 
defaultwa
defaults trying to deal with local stakeholders who are very interested
default in,
default an
defaultd concerned about, what is going. T
defaulthey are doing their best to keep them informed and it takes time and therefore costs money.
defaultChair:default 
defaultDo you want to pursue that?
defaultQ119 default&#xa0; 
defaultGrahame M. Morris:default 
defaultThere are 
defaultissues
default around conflict of interest
default—that is the concern. G
defaultiven the relatively small number of specialist accountancy firms that have this level of expertise
default,
default and 
defaultthat 
defaultmany of the board members and yourselves were formerly associated with these companies, is that a reasonable criticism?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultWe are trying very hard to deal with 
defaultthose conflicts. I have to say that, 
defaultif you got 
defaultin—
defaultfor example, 
defaultI formerly worked for McKinsey—
defaultmy former colleagues from McKinsey here now
default,
default I think they would tell you I was an extremely difficult client and not a pushover. But just to make sure that there is no conflict of interest, I excuse myself from all decisions about using McKinsey.
defaultQ120 default&#xa0; 
defaultGrahame M. Morris:default 
defaultBut 
defaultMcKinsey
default have done very well and 
defaultthey 
defaultmade £1.9 million from Monitor last year, did they not?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultThey charged £1.9 million, yes. They were not the only consultants we used. McKinsey do have particular expertise in health. We are not the only ones who use them. There are some areas where they are the best
default,
default 
defaultso 
defaultthat is who we use. 
defaultI
defaultt would be wrong to choose a second
default&#x2011;
defaultrate consultant just because one of us had worked for the
default best one
default in the past.
defaultQ121 default&#xa0; 
defaultGrahame M. Morris:default 
defaultI think the highest figure was for Pricewat
defaulterhouse
defaultCoopers and it was £2.7 million
default,
default 
defaultwith 
default£900,000 to KPMG and £800,000 to Deloitte. 
defaultT
defaulthey are considerable sums.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultThey are considerable sums
default,
default but at least you will notice that they are not all in one place. We try and select the best provider for every individual problem a
defaultnd run competitive processes and
default use the Government 
defaultconsulting frameworks and so on
default whenever we do that. 
defaultQ122 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultIf I 
defaultmay
default, I would like to ask you about non
default&#x2011;
defaultacute
default trusts and whether you are confident that the regulatory processes are sufficiently well designed to assess them because they are completely different 
defaultfrom
default the acute sector. I am seeing a couple of those community trusts up
default 
defaultfront
default,
default and my guess is that
default,
default whatever it is you are measuring
default,
default you are on planet 
defaultZog
default.
defaultDr Bennettdefault:
default We certainly need to change
default—
defaultand we have completely recognised this
default—or
default to adapt the way we look at trusts that are not the sort of traditional acute or mental health trusts that we are used to
default,
default and we have done that. One of the problems in almost anywhere except for acute is that the availability of information about these trusts is very weak, so it is very difficult to measure it. But we are trying to do our best
default in the circumstances. We chose
default not to
default—
defaultand you may disagree with this
default—
defaultsay, 
default“
defaultThis is a sector with poor information that is not well understood. Therefore, we will not authorise anybody as a foundation trust.
default”
default We have tried to be pragmatic and do the best we can
default,
default but we are also slowly getting them to produce more reliable data
default,
default so that
default,
default eventually
default,
default I hope every single bit of the provider landscape will be subject to the same degree of scrutiny as acute trusts are today.
defaultQ123 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultCan I ask just exactly what you measure and how you assess
default?
default Liverpool Community Health NHS 
defaultTrust, for example, is showing
default there a
defaultre no big concerns from the TDA,
default and yet I believe that, in a short time, there will be concerns shown to be 
defaultapplicable to that organisation.
default It is sitting there and everyone finds it hard to assess. How do you know you are not going to allow community trusts
default through
default, for example
default—
defaultpicking on them
default—which 
defaultyou would not let through
default 
defaulti
defaultf th
defaultey
default 
defaultwere
default an acute trust and you had a better understanding?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultThere are two bits to that in a way. There is quality
default,
default and there is everything else. On the quality front, this is where Mike Richards and his colleagues have a big challenge
default,
default because they start with a regime which is better at understanding what is going on in acute trusts and elsewhere and so they are working very fast and hard to try and develop similar inspection regimes
default to the one they have for acute trusts
default in community care, mental health and ambulance trusts.
defaultQ124 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultYou 
defaultmight
default start by thinking about the name
default—chief inspector of hospitals.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultYes, it is interesting, isn
default’
defaultt it
default, 
defaultthough 
defaultit was 
defaultnot my choice? 
defaultO
defaultn the quality front, which I would always say i
defaults the most important—
defaulta
defaultnd I am sorry to pass the buck—
defaultthat is the CQC
default,
default and I know Mike is very aware of the need to do that. On all the other dimensions that we look
default at
default, the governance, the financial performance and so on of a trust
default,
default the information is probably a little better
default,
default but it is still not good enough. 
defaultP
defaultart of what we 
defaulthave
default to do is to force some of these organisations to get better at describing what they are doing so that we can understand it better.
defaultQ125 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultTheir
default staff would probably appreciate that as well. It is a very difficult thing and I would like to come back to it on another occasion. I want to throw one final thing in, which I hope the Committee will discuss in the future. Last week
default,
default I met with a senior clinical psychologist who was
default—or 
defaultshe and her colleagues were
default—
defaultreally upset in that there were no beds to admit a teenager who had attempted suicide three times in one week. There was nothing available between here and 
defaultLeicester
default. How does that fit the idea that 
defaultwe are providing mental health—
defaulta differ
defaultent kind of trust—
defaultservices that are needed out there
default?
default Mental health and community trusts, I think, are not measured as well as they might be by your good selves.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultOr anybody else. I completely agree. I do not want to overstate it, but there is almost an obsession with acute trusts because it is 
defaultthe
default bit that people look 
defaultat, 
defaultwhere the light is shining
default. B
defaultut we have to shine the light everywhere, so I could not agree more. We have to get much better information about what is going on and particularly on the quality front
default,
default 
defaultas 
defaultI think someone mentioned earlier
default on: i
defaults there a problem with the funding of, say, mental health being squeezed
default? B
defaultut it is less clear what the consequences of that are because we do not have the equivalent of, say, four
default&#x2011;
defaulthour waiting targets in A and E. We do not have the equivalents. 
defaultIt
default is absolutely right
default that w
defaulte have to find better ways of measuring it.
defaultQ126 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultCan I put to you a question that I put to Jo Williams when she was here as chair of the CQC? They measure trusts
default;
default they measure this and that
default;
default but how do they measure, for example, care organisations going into homes
default?
default 
defaultS
defaulthe said, 
default“
defaultNo, we could not do that. We could not go into 
defaultthe home of 
defaulta person receiving the care to see.
default”
default 
defaultH
defaultow do you spot 
defaultwhat is happening and being delivered 
defaultif there is nobody else there except the carer coming in
default? S
defaulthe could not assess that. Therefore, you are trying to assess a community trust that is going into homes
default,
default but you are not actually
default there. 
defaultYou do surveys of staff
default,
default and, for example, I hear 
defaultfrom 
defaultlast year
default’
defaults survey of Liverpool Community Health NHS Trust 
defaultabout 
defaultbullying
default,
default the executives and real 
defaultproblems. What about flipping it over in this case and asking the recipients? 
defaultO
defaulttherwise
default,
default how else would you ever find out what is really going on?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultYou are right to reflect on your conversation with Jo Williams because
default,
default again
default,
default this is fundamentally a CQC issue. What we are seeing, for whatever reason, is a complete change in paradigm at the CQC. The way they are thinking about how you assess the quality of care that provider organisations are delivering is fundamentally changing. It is all about the real experts, people with their feet on the ground. I think David Prior, Jo
default’
defaults successor, has said they would even contemplate things like hidden cameras. 
defaultIt
default is for them to work out the best way to do it
default,
default but you have to find a way of assessing the real experience of patients in these places.
defaultQ127 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultAbsolutely
default, but I am saying to you
default, and
default perhaps you could write to me, 
defaultthat
default I want to try and understand, when you look at a community trust or a mental health trust, what you 
defaultare measuring.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultI am very happy to write to you on this, but one small thing I would say here is that when it comes to measuring quality, it is the CQC that is doing that.
defaultQ128 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default So what are 
defaultyou
default measuring? 
defaultYou are going to be part of the authorisation. Your name is going on the ticket. What are you measuring there? Are you saying, 
default“Oh, I agree with them”
default? 
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultOn the quality front
default,
default we take the lead from the CQC.
defaultQ129 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultSo what is different?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: T
defaulthe other things we will look at
default,
default essentially
default,
default 
defaultare 
defaultthe things we look at in all organisations
default—
defaulttheir governance, processes, the quality of the leadership of the people and the strength of their fin
defaultancial performance and position,
default 
default“
defaultDo they have good plans and strategies
default?”
default It is all the same sorts of things 
defaultthat
default we look at in any other organisation.
defaultQ130 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultYou will be 
defaultbusy
default in Liverpool
default,
default then.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultWould you like us to write to you and set that out?
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultPlease.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultThen we will. 
defaultQ131 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultCan I 
defaultend
default with a slightly mischievous question? How much of your working day do you spend on the FT pipeline these days?
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultI thought for a moment you were going to ask me how much of the working day do I spend on Monitor. It depends how long your working day is. On the FT pipeline, actually
default—
default 
defaultQ132 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultThe purpose of the 
defaultquestion
default, plainly, is to wonder where that is in your order of priorities. 
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultYes. 
defaultGoodness, where shall I start? 
defaultMiranda Carter, Stephen and 
defaultAdrian
default’
defaults opposite number, who looks after the assessment of trusts, has developed a very strong and
default,
default I 
defaultthink
default,
default important relationship with the TDA. One of the things we have explicitly changed over the last 12 to 18 months is that I want us to do whatever we can
default,
default without compromising our independence
default,
default to help the TDA get trusts through the pipeline. The reason that is incredibly important is that all we are doing when we assess a trust is saying
default,
default 
default“
defaultIs this an organisation providing high
default-
defaultquality care on a sustainable basis?
default”
default 
defaultE
defaultvery single trust in the country, as far as I am concerned, ought to be able to answer yes
default,
default and it is not good that 97 of them at the moment cannot. So anything we can do to help David Flory and his people is important. David 
defaulthas acknowledged—I think he is saying—that 
default14 at the moment probably cannot make it in their current form. I think there will be challenges beyond 14
default,
default and of course there 
defaultare
default the financial squeeze increases which will just make it even more difficult
default,
default but we still have to get them up to that standard. 
defaultW
defaulte are doing a variety of things to try and help on that front. 
defaultThe other issue here 
defaultgoes
default back to the CQC. 
defaultT
defaulth
defaulte Monitor board made a decision
default a few months ago. We said 
defaultthat, 
defaultbecause the CQC has said its old paradigm of inspecting hospitals or provider or
defaultganisations was not good enough,
default we are not going to authorise any more trusts until they can assure us that they have fixed 
defaultthat problem. On the non
default&#x2011;
defaultacute
default trusts 
defaultin particular
default,
default it has taken a while
default,
default because they 
defaulthave to work out how to do it. T
defaulthat is holding up the pipeline, but I think it is the right thing to do. 
defaultW
defaulthen Mike is in there doing his inspections
default,
default I suspect he will find some problems in some of them and they might take a bit longer befo
defaultre they are ready to come to us, b
defaultut
default,
default if there are problems
default,
default they have to b
defaulte identified and dealt with. Does
default that answer your question? 
defaultQ133 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultYes, it does
default,
default in a way that reassures that there is a commitment to quality across the piece. We started out with a lot of rhetoric about how this was all going to be complete by 2015. It plainly is not.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultYes. I think it was even April 2014, was
defaultn’t
default it, originally?
defaultChair:default 
defaultForgive me, yes.
defaultDr Bennettdefault: 
defaultI always thought it was a mistake to set an absolutely hard deadline. I could see the merits of putting pressure on the system
default,
default because if you think that what this is about is g
defaultetting trusts up to a standard—
defaultforget 
defaultabout the FT label or anything—
defaultwe s
defaulthould do it as fast as possible. B
defaultut the danger in my mind with setting a very short deadline was that corners would be attempted to be cut. Hopefully, we would have spotted it, but you would not want them cut in the first place. 
defaultM
defaultore flexibility around the time scale is right. I think David Flory and his people are very committed to getting these trusts up to the requisite standard as fast as they can, but I do not think there is 
defaultany 
defaultpretending but that it is going to be a very big challenge in some of these organisations.
defaultChair:default 
defaultOkay. We have taken up enough of your 
defaultand our time
default. Thank you very much indeed for coming. We shall reflect on what you have said, as ever.
