[normal] the opportunity to 
[normal]provide this submission to the Committee and respond 
[normal]to questions most relevant to PWYP’s 
[normal]mandate 
[normal]as a coalition working for transparency and accountability in the extractive industries.
[normal] 
[normal]Th

[normal] sub

[normal]Executive summary[bold] and recommendations[bold]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1[bold]. [bold]What is the contribution to the UK economy of extractive industries in the UK? [bold]1
[normal].1
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]PWYP is concerned that the 
[normal]economic 
[normal]contribution of EI
[normal] in the UK and other countries 
[normal]is 
[normal]not as 
[normal]positive 
[normal]as it 
[normal]sh
[normal]ould be. 
[normal]Globally, corruption and other aspects of the widely documented “resource curse”
[normal] 
[normal](or better: “resource challenge)
[normal], 
[normal]including 
[normal]economic “
[normal]externalities
[normal]”
[normal],
[normal] are reco
[normal]gnised 
[normal]as 
[normal]wide-scale 
[normal]and largely socialised
[normal] in terms of costs
[normal], i.e. 
[normal]costs are 
[normal]borne by society at large including in the UK.
[normal] 
[normal]By contrast, EI profits are excessively privatised, including through 
[normal]exploitative contractual terms with some host countries (which ultimately impact on the UK through the effects of global 
[normal]poverty and poor resource governance), 
[normal]the use of profit shifting through transfer mispricing
[normal], secret deals,
[normal] and the use of secretive shell companies and tax havens
[normal] – the latter including UK Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies
[normal].

[normal]T
[normal]he world’s 
[normal]t
[normal]en 
[normal]largest extractive companies, including 
[normal]London
[normal]-listed BP, Shell, 
[normal]Glencore 
[normal]Xstrata, 
[normal]Rio Tinto, BHP
[normal] 
[normal]Billiton
[normal] and 
[normal]Anglo American
[normal], are reported as 
[normal]own
[normal]ing and controlling more than 
[normal]6,
[normal]000
[normal] separate companies
[normal], at least a third of which are 
[normal]incorporated in 
[normal]tax 
[normal]s
[normal]ecrecy 
[normal]j
[normal]urisdictions
[normal] (tax havens)
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.
[normal]3
[normal]  
[normal]Recommendation
[normal]: To address concerns about 
[normal]profit shifting, transfer mispricing
[normal], secret deals
[normal] and the use of secretive shell companies and tax havens, 
[normal]The
[normal] UK 
[normal]Government 
[normal]should implement an open public registry of beneficial ownership for all UK-listed and 
[normal]UK-
[normal]registered companies
[normal],
[normal] and with other countries take speedy and effective action to curtail profit shifting and the use of tax secrecy jurisdictions 
[normal](tax 
[normal]havens
[normal]) 
[normal]– inc
[normal]luding among them UK Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies – and 
[normal]ensure 
[normal]publi
[normal]cation of all EI contracts and licences
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2[bold]. [bold]What are the corporate governance concerns raised by the number of extractive industries companies listed in the UK? Are there [bold]reputational risks for the UK and UK financial institutions in being a centre for such businesses?[bold]2
[normal].1  Besides the “externalities” referred to 
[normal]in 
[normal]para 
[normal]1.1, 
[normal]which include negative environmental and human rights impacts, EI are associated
[normal] in resource-rich developing countries 
[normal]with corruption
[normal], 
[normal] 
[normal]capital flight 
[normal]and 
[normal]similar 
[normal]aspects of the “resource curse”
[normal] (“resource challenge”)
[normal], which across all economic sectors 
[normal]cost Africa an 
[normal]estimated $854bn from 1970 to 2008.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal].2  Corporate governance co
[normal]ncerns about EI companies listed 
[normal]and registered 
[normal]in the UK
[normal], and 
[normal]reputational risks for the UK and 
[normal]for 
[normal]UK financial institutions
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]are considerable and 
[normal]will remain 
[normal]significant and in some cases high 
[normal]for 
[normal]as long as the EI globally exhibit a lack of 
[normal]transparency and accountability
[normal] and do not visibly contribute to equitable and sustainable patterns of economic development.
[normal] 
[normal]An estimated 
[normal]1.6 billion people
[normal] live in resource-rich developing countries, of whom at present approximately 
[normal]640m or 40%
[normal] li
[normal]ve 
[normal]on l
[normal]ess than 
[normal]$2 a 
[normal]day
[normal] (a higher proportion than 
[normal]in resource
[normal]-
[normal]poor countries
[normal])
[normal], while EI senior executives earn 
[normal]far more than is reasonable
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal].3  
[normal]UK-listed EI companies and UK financial institutions will 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]be associated with a sense of injustice on the part of 
[normal]hundreds of thousands of 
[normal]citizens of resource-rich developing countries unless and until UK-listed
[normal]/registered 
[normal]companies are clearly 
[normal]and comprehensively proven 
[normal]to be contributing
[normal] 
[normal]equitabl
[normal]y
[normal] and sustainab
[normal]l
[normal]y 
[normal]to host-country economies through payment of 
[normal]appropriate levels of 
[normal]taxes, royalties, etc.
[normal], for the non-renewable natural resource they extract. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4  
[normal]Recommendation
[normal]: 
[normal]The UK Government should ensure s
[normal]peedy and effective implementation of the EU Accounting 
[normal]Directive 
[normal](Chapter 10: 
[normal]country-by-country reporting of payments to governments
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]the 
[normal]Transparency Directive
[normal], and as soon as possible implement the Directives with 
[normal]open and 
[normal]machine-readable data ac
[normal]cording to the 
[normal]G8 
[normal]Open Data Charter.
[normal] 
[normal]In addition, EI financial transparency in the UK and EU needs to be accompanied by the establishment of a global mandatory EI financial transparency standard
[normal], i.e. equivalent disclosure rules in all major jurisdictions
[normal] and capital markets, 
[normal]and to lead to effective EI financial accountability, including 
[normal]regarding company 
[normal]beneficial ownership and contract transparency as noted in 
[normal]para 
[normal]1.
[normal]3
[normal] above, 
[normal]with 
[normal]empowered and informed civil society in resource-rich developing countri
[normal]es able to hold companies and their governments to account for natural resource revenues. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3[bold]. [bold]Is there sufficient engagement between UK extractive industries and the NGO sector? Are there examples of best practice in engagement between the extractive [bold]industries and NGOs?[bold]3
[normal].1  
[normal]To date there has not been 
[normal]sufficient constructive 
[normal]engagement between UK 
[normal]EI 
[normal]companies 
[normal]and NGO
[normal]s
[normal]. 
[normal]In PWYP’s experience, EI companies have engag
[normal]ed
[normal] 
[normal]only 
[normal]very reluctantly in initiatives that 
[normal]enhance transparency and accountability, 
[normal]often alleging 
[normal]– but failing to satisfactorily substantiate – cost, 
[normal]confidentiality, competitiveness and 
[normal]supposed 
[normal]criminal liability as reasons why they cannot become more transparent and accountable. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2  However, there have been differences between min
[normal]ing and oil companies in this regard, and among oil companies. 
[normal]Among the larger companies, m
[normal]in
[normal]ers
[normal] have 
[normal]appeared 
[normal]more willing to 
[normal]recognise and implement the emerging global mandatory transparency standard 
[normal]than have oil companies, 
[normal]although 
[normal]among UK oil companies one smaller company has 
[normal]already 
[normal]embrace
[normal]d
[normal] financial transparency on a 
[normal]proactive and 
[normal]voluntary basis. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3
[normal].3  PWYP has concerns about the fact that 
[normal]UK-listed 
[normal]and UK-registered EI multinational companies 
[normal]that belong to the American Petro
[normal]leum Institute (API) have not dissociated themselves from
[normal], and therefore can be considered to support,
[normal] the API
[normal]’s
[normal] law suit in the US 
[normal]against the SEC’s rules for Dodd-Frank Section 1504 (country-by-country reporting of payments to governments
[normal], equivalent to 
[normal]the EU Directives’ requirements).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4  S
[normal]ome 
[normal]EI companies
[normal] 
[normal]have been 
[normal]lobbying to delay and/or weaken UK and EU implementation of the Accounting and Transparency Directive
[normal]s, such as by pleading the need for specific country 
[normal]exemptions
[normal] and/or alleging compet
[normal]itiveness concerns in light of delays in US implementation of Dodd-Frank Section 1504 following the API court case, which the companies themselves instigated. All this despite the UK Government’s and the G8’s public commitment to see these Directives speed
[normal]ily and fully implemented.
[normal] PWYP regards this as a lack of good faith on the part of such companies, which claim to champion transparency and to obey the law wherever they operate.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5  
[normal]Recommendation
[normal]: The UK Government should make it clear to EI companie
[normal]s that a 
[normal]global mandatory transparency standard, without 
[normal]any country 
[normal]reporting exemptions, is here to stay and that it will not 
[normal]consider special pleading 
[normal]on the part of EI companies on alleged competition, confidentiality, cost or other grounds
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4[bold]. [bold]What [bold]is the impact o[bold]n[bold] the industry of the UK signing up to the EITI?[bold]4
[normal].1  PWYP has called for the UK to sign up to the EITI for
[normal] 
[normal]some years and sees this as a positive step. As 
[normal]the initiator of the EITI, the UK’s commitment 
[normal]to
[normal] 
[normal]implement
[normal] helps address 
[normal]objections
[normal] 
[normal]that the EITI has been yet another instance of the global North 
[normal]telling
[normal] the South what to do. 
[normal]It will also provide a forum in which 
[normal]UK 
[normal]civil society can, 
[normal]potentially
[normal], dialogue constructively with industry and government.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].2  
[normal]There is
[normal] a
[normal] need for 
[normal]UK EITI 
[normal]delivery to match the rhetoric
[normal] about the UK “getting its house in order”. 
[normal]Although
[normal], unlike Norway, the UK failed to invest proceeds from its North Sea oil 
[normal]bonanza
[normal] in long-term 
[normal]funding
[normal] for pensions 
[normal]and 
[normal]other public goods,
[normal] 
[normal]the UK needs a well-informed public
[normal] debate about 
[normal]resource sustainability, 
[normal]progress towards a low-carbon economy
[normal] and the entrenchment of transparency as a national norm.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].3  
[normal]T
[normal]he UK 
[normal]should 
[normal]implement the EITI to a high standard. Anything less will reflect negatively on the UK’s reputation as
[normal] a champion of 
[normal]EI 
[normal]good governance.

[normal]:  The UK Government should ensure that the UK

[normal]recommendation 
[normal]for 
[normal]beneficial ownership public transparency; 
[normal]ensure 
[normal]full EI contract transparency in the UK; 
[normal]through the multi-stakeholder group 
[normal]support “
[normal]capacity-building efforts, especially with civil society and through
[normal] 
[normal]civil society organisations, to increase awareness of the process, improve
[normal] 
[normal]understanding of the information and data from the 
[normal]reports, and enc
[normal]ourage
[normal] 
[normal]use of the information
[normal]”; and as soon as possible implement 
[normal]the EITI 
[normal]with 
[normal]open and 
[normal]machine-readable data.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5[bold]. [bold]Would increased regulation for London listed extractives companies result in competition from elsewhere or can it be used to make the UK a[bold] centre of excellence for best practice and corporate governance?[bold]5
[normal].1  
[normal]The UK should apply 
[normal]proportionate
[normal] and effective 
[normal]regulation
[normal] to UK-listed 
[normal]and UK-registered 
[normal]EI companies
[normal],
[normal] irrespective of potential or alleged effects on 
[normal]competition
[normal]. 
[normal]Attempting
[normal] to benefit from anything resembling a “race to the bottom” 
[normal]would
[normal] be a poor approach for the UK to 
[normal]take
[normal] and undermine its 
[normal]international
[normal] moral authority
[normal] in this area
[normal].
