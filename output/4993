[normal]Written evidence submitted by Mark Ryan
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1. My name is Mark Ryan and I am a Senior Lecturer in Constitutional and Administrative Law at 
[normal]Coventry
[normal] 
[normal]University
[normal]. My submission, however, is made in my personal capacity and indicates my 
[normal]brief 
[normal]personal observations in respect of the 
[normal]Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011
[normal]. It in no way reflects the views of my employer (Coventry University). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. 
[normal]At the outset the point must be made that the enactment of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 is to be welcomed as 
[normal]providing a degree of certainty to
[normal] the date of 
[normal]parliamentary elections and in doing so reducing 
[normal]executive power in the United Kingdom’s uncodified constitutional arrangements.
[normal] In addition, 
[normal]the Act 
[normal]will allow for a more structured approach to the legislative process. 
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. In order to ensure that the final year of the Parliament includes a substantive and viable legislative programme, 
[normal]two points could be made. Firstly, 
[normal]Government 
[normal]Bills scheduled to form part of the 2014-15 session should be 
[normal]issued 
[normal]in 
[normal]draft 
[normal]in early 2014 in order that the 
[normal]principal 
[normal]elements of the
[normal]se 
[normal]measure
[normal]s
[normal] c
[normal]an b
[normal]e examined 
[normal]an
[normal]d
[normal] scrutinised well in advance of 
[normal]the
[normal]m being introduced as 
[normal]fully fledged Bill
[normal]s
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]As an aside, 
[normal]the 
[normal]publication o
[normal]f 
[normal]Bills in draft 
[normal]should be standard 
[normal]legislative practice
[normal] in any event
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]Secondly
[normal] (and as a caveat to the above), 
[normal]t
[normal]he content of any 
[normal]B
[normal]ill 
[normal]scheduled 
[normal]for the 2014-15 session
[normal] 
[normal]should not be too party politically controversial or indeed contain any major constitutional reform 
[normal]proposals
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. 
[normal]One key 
[normal]advantage of the Fixed-term Parliaments 
[normal]A
[normal]ct is
[normal],
[normal] of course
[normal],
[normal] that it should dispense with the 
[normal]‘
[normal]wash up
[normal]’
[normal] and allow
[normal] 
[normal]for 
[normal]legislation to be carefully 
[normal]scheduled 
[normal] (at least in the House of Commons) 
[normal]and 
[normal]so enable appropriate 
[normal]and adequate 
[normal]scrutiny to take place
[normal] 
[normal]of 
[normal]each element of 
[normal]every 
[normal]Bill
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]In terms of select committees, they will 
[normal]also 
[normal]be 
[normal]able to plan and 
[normal]co-ordinate 
[normal]the 
[normal]gathering and marshalling of 
[normal]written and oral 
[normal]evidence in 
[normal]the light of 
[normal]a more organised and 
[normal]predictable 
[normal]legislative programme.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. It is arguable that if there had not been a Conservative–Liberal Democrat Coalition Government, then the detail of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act might have been different. 
[normal] 
[normal]In particular, it could be 
[normal]posited 
[normal]that the key provision of section 
[normal]1
[normal] may well have been a term of four years as opposed to five in the 
[normal]Act
[normal]. 
[normal]A four year term would arguably 
[normal]have fitted in more with the existing structure of 
[normal]our 
[normal]constitutional arrangements
[normal] (viz., devolution
[normal]/
[normal] local government
[normal] and the practical reality of 
[normal]the length of 
[normal]recent parliamentary terms
[normal]).
[normal]      
[normal] 
[normal]     
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6. Finally, it is earne
[normal]stly 
[normal]hoped that the report 
[normal]that t
[normal]h
[normal]is 
[normal]select committee 
[normal]will publish in due course 
[normal]on th
[normal]e Fixed-term Parliaments Act 
[normal]will 
[normal]be 
[normal]considered carefully 
[normal]by the 
[normal]committee 
[normal]to be set up in 2020 
[normal]which will u
[normal]ndertake a review of the operation of the Act (having been set up 
[normal]by the Prime Minister
[normal] 
[normal]in 2020 
[normal]in accordance with 
[normal]section 7
[normal])
[normal].
