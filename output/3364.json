"&#xa0;\nOffice of the Solicitor to the Scottish Parliament – Written evidence&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDear Lord Rooker,\n&#xa0;\nDraft Deregulation Bill&#xa0;I refer to the Committees consideration of the implications of the draft Deregulation Bill. The Scottish Parliament has an interest in so far as clauses 50 – 52 and Schedule 16 have an effect on provisions within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament.\n&#xa0;\nMy understanding is that the provisions in Schedule 16 may be repealed by order of the Minister, with consent of Scottish Ministers. Clause 50 as applied to Schedule 16 provides that the legislation will to cease to apply. The Schedule also provides for directions for amendment or repeal of the provisions.  I assume that to the extent those repeals or amendments are within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament they will be subject to an LCM in accordance with the normal convention and the Scottish Parliament will have a chance to consider the effect of the provisions.\n&#xa0;\nHowever clause 51 is a further power for the Minister by order to provide for (other) \nlegislation\n to cease to apply, if the Minister considers it no longer of practical use. The implication is that this would also enable amendment or repeal of provisions within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament if they were included in an ASP. Exercise of this power does not appear to envisage any role for the Scottish Parliament albeit that consent of the Scottish Ministers would be sought.  \n&#xa0;\nSince this is a power to repeal or amend provisions in Westminster Acts, or subordinate legislation made under those Acts, but not in ASPs, it could extend to Scottish SIs or other instruments made since 1999, though made under powers in Acts (Section 51(3), referring to “subordinate legislation” as defined in the Interpretation Act 1978, s.21).  It also seems to extend to provisions within legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament in Westminster Acts which have been consented to by LCM, as well as pre-devolution Act provisions where competence is now with the Scottish Parliament.\n&#xa0;\nA similar situation arose in section 9 of the Public Bodies Act 2011, requiring consent for orders to abolish or modify/transfer the functions of certain bodies/offices-\n&#xa0;\nhttp://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/24/section/9\n&#xa0;\nThe 2011 Act has powers for the Minister to abolish various English/Welsh/reserved bodies by order, but the consent of the Scottish Parliament may be required where certain functions of Scottish Ministers are modified.  Specific provision has been made in the Standing Orders of the Scottish Parliament to deal with these Orders, analogous to the LCM process for primary legislation. Adopting a similar solution would require further amendment to the Standing Orders.\n&#xa0;\nhttp://www.scottish.parliament.uk/parliamentarybusiness/17797.aspx\n&#xa0;\nClause 56 applies a draft negative procedure, which was very unusual in Scotland and was abandoned by the Interpretation and Legislative Reform (S) Act 2010. It may therefore be considered more appropriate for approval of the subordinate legislation in the Scottish Parliament, instead of by a consent process to reflect the existing negative or affirmative processes already \navailable  to\n the Scottish Parliament.  \n&#xa0;\nI trust that the Committee will find these comments helpful.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nLynda A Towers \nSolicitor to the Scottish Parliament\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4\nth\n November 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n              \n              \n"
