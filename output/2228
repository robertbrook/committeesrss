[normal]The sports journalist: Amy Lawrence is deputy [bold]football[bold] correspondent for the Observer and one of the two women mentioned in the Press Gazette 2012 list of top 50 sports journalists.[bold]She said: "To be on that list didn't make me feel lonely, more like chuffed. It was a rewarding feeling to be included among all the men. Although I am aware of others who have felt discrimination in this business, I have never felt it personally. From day one I have concentrated on trying to do my best as a writer - not as a female writer. I have tried to demonstrate my passion and interest in my subject as a football lover - not a female football lover. Sometimes I notice I am in the minority. I recall being at the World Cup final, looking around the press box and suddenly being struck that I was the only woman I could see there. But, frankly, I think about it seldom. I feel completely comfortable in my working world and most people in it treat me in a way I am perfectly happy to be treated. Those who doubted my ability because I am a woman are won around when they see my work.
[normal]"I love my job. I am tremendously fortunate. It is a far tougher job to come into now because of the general difficulties facing newspapers, but with strong knowledge and unyielding passion for your sport, it is possible."

[normal]She acknowledged that media coverage is aimed mainly at men: "I'll bet you when there is the Brazil World Cup and the Rio Olympics, the television cameras will be trained on beautiful female members of the crowd.
[normal]"I don't know how much determination there is to market specifically to female sports enthusiasts from big companies and promoters. Certain broadcasters and papers are keen, but I sense they find it hard to make the kind of breakthrough they'd like.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]"Football is my main area of expertise and I do believe progress has been made there. I recall going to a game in the away section at Derby County's Baseball Ground in the late 1980s and when I went off in search of the ladies at half time, I discovered there were none. Not one!
[normal]"Female sports writers can succeed, even if we are in the minority. Coverage of women's sports needs role models: people who capture the imagination. I have also thought for a while it would be great to link women's sports as events with their male equivalents. At Wimbledon, a day at centre court can mean a game or two of each, or doubles. I would love to see a women's football game played pre-match or post-match of a Premier League game. The crowds would not be massive but some of the crowd who come early/stay late can see the women's game and begin to develop a stronger bond with it.

[normal]"In terms of participation in sport, the DCMS should do more to prevent schools selling of their playing fields."

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The sports PR[bold]"I worked as a press officer for a Championship football club; this is one area in football clubs where there tend to be more women.
[normal]"Part of my role was to meet the football manager after the game, outside the changing room, so I could escort him to meet the press. This was a) so he knew where the press were gathered and b) he could be briefed on the mood of the press since the press officer would have been sitting with them during the game.
[normal]"On one particular away game, at a club in the north of England, I was given a pass by the home team media department giving me access to all areas. I went to meet my manager and as I was walking towards the tunnel I was told I was not allowed in. I showed the steward my pass and explained who I was and why I needed to be outside the changing room. I was told 'no women were allowed in the tunnel as there were men getting changed in there' (this was 2010 not 1910 in case you are wondering). 
[normal]"When my manager came out and found I was not there, he was not happy. He came storming out of the tunnel and screamed to know where the **** I had been. The only thing that saved me from the hairdryer treatment was that he was stunned into silence when he discovered the reason for my absence.
[normal]"The team did eventually apologise for the policy and agreed to review it. I was not the only female PR, and there were female physiotherapists and team assistants belonging to other clubs who must have been stopped going about their work for many years because of this policy."
