defaultWritten evidence from
default 
defaultthe Highways Agency Trade Union Side
default (SRN 012)
default 
defaultThis submission is made by the Highways Agency 
defaultTrade Union Side (HATUS).  The HATUS is made up of the Public and Commercial 
defaultServices Union (
defaultPCS
default) and Prospect Union. The two unions represent
default staff at all grades below the Senior Civil Service in the Highways Agency including members in the Traffic Officer Service. 
defaultIn the notice for the inquiry the Committee asked 
defaultHow should the 
defaultHighways Agency be reformed to make it “the world’s leading highway operator”?
default;
default and  
defaultHow will the policies set out in the Government’s “Action for Roads” command paper improve the strategic road network for all road users, whilst also improving the environ
defaultment? 
default In this submission we set out our views on those two points.
defaultSummary
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultHATUS
default are opposed to the intention set out in 
default“
defaultAction for Roads
default”
default to change the status of the Agency from an Executive Agency to an as yet undefined publicly-owned com
defaultpany 
default(
defaultPubCo
default). 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe do not believe that a change in status is required 
defaultto improve the efficiency of the Agency 
defaultand that 
defaultPubCo
default is the final staging post to privatisation of the strategic road network in 
defaultEngland
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultPrivatisation will inevitably lead to tolling of 
defaultmajor routes
default which will have a detrimental impact on the environment, road safety and local economies.
defaultHow should the Highways Agency be reformed to make it “the world’s leading highway operator”? default1.
default              
defaultIn the foreword to 
default“
defaultAction for Roads
default”
default, the Secretary of
default State maintains that reform of the Agency is required and that “more certainty, clearer instructions and less political interference will mean greater efficiency, better service to motorists and the environment.”  
default2.
default              
defaultTo substantiate this, t
defaulthere is much r
defaulteliance on the fact that the current Non-Executive Chairman of the Agency, Alan Cook, in his 
defaultindependent
default 2011 report “A Fresh Start for the Strategic Road Network” recommended a change in status for the Highways Agency
default. However
default,
default any deci
defaultsion on this was 
defaultpost
defaultponed to allow time for a feasibility study announced by the Prime Minister in late 2011 to look at alternative ownership and financing options. This was made clear in the Government’s response to the Cook report published
default in May 2012
default. The then Secreta
defaultry of State said “I do not propose to make any decisions on the need to change the Agency's status ahead of the feasibility study concluding
default”
default.
default3.
default              
defaultThe outcome of this feasibility study has not been published. Instead 
default“
defaultAction for Roads
default”
default contains 
defaultthe 
defaultunsubsta
defaultntiated claim
default that a change in status 
defaultof the Highways Agency 
defaultis 
defaultthe only way to 
defaultdeal with a number of barriers to efficiency as summarised in Chapter 4 figure 4.1
default of the document
default.
default4.
default              
defaultWe disagree that a change in status of the Agency as suggested is the ans
defaultwer. We believe that greater efficiencies can be delivered through full implementation of the recommendations first made in “Better Government Services – Executive Agencies in the 21
defaultst
default Century” published by HM Treasury in 2002. That was “to ensure agencies
default have three-year funding agreements and full end year flexibility” over this funding period.
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
default5.
default              
defaultGreater 
defaultautonomy from the central department was the reason why the Agency was 
defaultfirst 
defaultcreated in 1994. 
defaultIt was 
defaultformed as part of the government’s “Next Steps” 
defaultprogramme that began in 1988. The stated aim of that programme was to ensure that executive functions of government should be carried out as far as possible by units clearly designated within departments. A key element was to use private sector and more co
defaultmmercial approaches to deliver public services. 
default&#xa0;
default6.
default              
defaultCommon features of Next Steps agencies were:
default&#xa0;
default●
defaultClearly defined tasks aims and objectives;
default●
defaultKey performance targets;
default●
defaultA chief executive; and 
default●
defaultAn emphasis on customer service.
default&#xa0;
defaultThese are the same 
defaultobjectives set out in 
default“
defaultAction for Roads
default”
default.
default&#xa0;
default7.
default              
defaultThe original framework document 
default(published 1 April 1994) 
defaultstipulated that the Agency would be responsible for managing and maintaining the trunk road and motorway network as well as managing and delivering agree
defaultd programmes of new and improved schemes aimed at removing bottlenecks. That same framework concluded that ministers would remain responsible for overall policy on trunk roads in 
defaultEngland
default and by extension the size and shape of work 
defaultprogrammes set for the Ag
defaultency. 
default&#xa0;
default8.
default              
defaultThe Highways Agency was subject to a 
default“Next Steps” 
defaultreview in 1999. It concluded that the Agency had made considerable progress in improving efficiency over the first five years of its existence, had successfully switched focus to become a network
default operator in line with the then Government policy set out in the White Paper
default&#xa0;
default “
defaultA New Deal for Trunk Roads in England” published in July 1998, and had introduced innovative cost saving measures such as value engineering. 
default&#xa0;
default9.
default              
defaultThe review concluded that
default&#xa0;
default grea
defaultter efficiencies might be achieved if there was greater clarity in the respective roles of the Agency and the central department; if better use was made of external Board members; and if a measure of performance was introduced that did not rely solely on q
defaultuantified targets for maintenance and construction. The suggestion was also made that a service level agreement for the road network with some form of independent roads’ inspector to monitor it could usefully be established
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default10.
default              
defaultA wider government revie
defaultw of all executive agencies undertaken in 2002 reached similar conclusions – that the Agency was efficient but that the working relationship between the Agency and the department and the lack of definition of roles and accountability was a barrier to great
defaulter efficiency. This same issue was identified by the Nichols report of 2007 (Review of Highways Agency’s Major Roads Programme) which found 
default&#xa0;
default“There is some Confusion regarding accountabilities, roles and responsibilities between the Department for Transpo
defaultrt (
defaultDfT
default), the Highways Agency (HA) and the regional bodies; and responsibilities for the TPI (
defaultTargeted Programme of Improvements) 
defaultare split within both 
defaultDfT
default and HA. HA is stated to be responsible for delivery but, because of increasing costs, 
defaultDfT
default staff incr
defaulteasingly intervene. Given the size of the forward investment programme, these arrangements must urgently be clarified and enhanced. …….with the 
defaultDfT
default taking on a stronger strategy and sponsor role, and HA becoming more clearly responsible for delivery.”
default&#xa0;
default11.
default              
defaultSo there is long standing common consensus that greater efficiency could be achieved if the Agency had more freedom than it currently enjoys
default, and if there was 
defaultgreater surety of funding
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default12.
default              
defaultAll of this can be achieved without changing the status of the 
defaultAgency. 
defaultAs we now have fixed parliaments there is no reason why a five year funding agreement could not be put in place from 2015. We recognise that such surety of funding will mean that the department will have less flexibility to meet its departmental ex
defaultpenditure limit, but if there is robust governance of budgets across the department this should not present an insurmountable problem.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default14.
default              
default“
defaultAction for Roads
default”
default makes two new claims for inefficiency that have not previously been identified. These are that government regulations around 
defaultprocurement and contract management make the Agency less efficient and that 
defaultcivil service pay restraint makes it difficult to attract suitable staff.
default&#xa0;
default15.
default              
defaultIt is not clear how changing status would overcome either of these barriers. As a public company the Agency would still be bound by public procurement rules and its contract management arrangements would still be subject to scrutiny by the National Audit O
defaultffice, Public Accounts Committee and the Transport 
defaultSelect
default Committee. The current contract arrangements 
defaultthat the Agency follows 
defaultwere largely driven by recommendations made by all of these bodies.
default16.
default              
defaultSimilarly, all public sector pay is subject to restraint 
defaultand we doubt that an exception would be m
defaultade for the Agency. No evidence is provided to substantiate the claim that the Agency finds it hard to compete for staff on the international labour market. Has it tried? We do agree that pay constraints are an issu
defaulte and our concerns previously provided to the Select Committee to its inquiry on the work of the Highways Agency 
defaultremain 
default(Eighth Report of Session 2002-03 HC453)
default.
default Low pay does impact adversely on morale, and anecdotal evidence from our members is that 
defaultmany 
defaultexperienced staff 
defaultare
default contemplating early retirement as a result.
default 
default17.
default              
defaultHATUS
default believe that the real intention behind changing the status of the Agency is to make it easier to privatise it in future. Alan Cook confirmed this in a recent interview with a nati
defaultonal newspaper.
default 
default&#xa0;
default18.
default              
defaultPrivatisation will only be possible if a revenue stream can be created. The most obvious means to achieve this is to levy tolls. The Department for Transport announced a pilot project on 2 October 2013 to 
defaultplace a network of sensors al
defaultong 
defaulta 50-mile stretch of the A14 
defaultto 
defaultcreat
defaulte
default a smart road 
defaultthat can
default monitor traffic by sending signals to and from mobile phones in moving vehicles.
default As reported in the Guardian newspaper this is seen as 
defaulta first step in building the infrastructure for charging
default motorists to use busy roads.
default 
default&#xa0;
default19.
default              
defaultTolls are not 
defaultpopular in the 
defaultUK
default and all the evidence is that they do not work. Part of the problem is the availability of diversionary routes. The road network in 
defaultEngland
default is well connected and built to a high density. A 
defaultreport issued by consultants Atkins in November 2012 found that tolls on the A14 could result in up to 35 per cent of traffic using the existing road being diverted onto other local roads. Most traffic congestion occurs on local roads rather than the strat
defaultegic network so this sort of shift will see severe environmental impacts.
default&#xa0;
default 20.
default              
defaultThe one major toll road already built through private investment – the M6 toll in the 
defaultWest Midlands
default opened in 2003 has proved a disaster both as an investment and as a relief r
defaultoad (
defaultits
default original purpose). As well as losing money the scheme did not avoid the need for further public investment 
defaultbecause traffic continued to use the alternative M6 which has recently been improved by the Agency in an attempt to alleviate congestion.
default&#xa0;
default2
default1.
default              
defaultMotorists are a highly vocal campaign constituency and are unlikely to accept widespread tolling of existing routes. When proposals for road pricing were put forward in 2007, over 1.8 million people signed a petition against the proposal. This remains a
default record for an on-line petition. In a Daily Telegraph poll taken in 2012 over 80% of participants rejected the question “can privatised roads get 
defaultBritain
default moving again”
default&#xa0;
default22. The likelihood is that any form of direct charging for access to the strategic road
default network will result in diversion of traffic to other “free” routes. This will be bad for safety, bad for the environment and bad for local economies.
defaultHow will the policies set out in the Government’s “Action for Roads” command paper improve the strategic defaultroad network for all road users, whilst also improving the environment?default23.
default              
defaultThe language used throughout 
default“
defaultAction for Roads
default”
default is disappointing. The environment seems very much an afterthought.  The focus 
defaultis 
defaulton providing more road space, quicker and cheaper
default, turning the clock back to the late 1980s/early 1990s when predict and provide were the watchwords. 
defaultThere is no recognition of the 
default1994 
defaultSACTRA report
default into induced traffic
default,
default 
defaultthe threat posed by climate change, or the impact of 
defaulttraffic-
defaultgenerated 
defaultpoor air qua
defaultlity.
default24.
default              
defaultThere seems to be an acceptance 
defaultby the department 
defaultthat traffic volumes will grow at least in line with predictions
default;
default and that the challenge is to 
defaultprovide a strategic road network to cater for 
defaultthis
default. As long ago as 1997 the Agency recognised that th
defaultis was not sustainable. We are therefore disappointed that there is no mention in 
default“
defaultAction for Roads
default”
default of modal shift or reducing car dependency.
default 
default&#xa0;
default25. Climate change, if unchecked, will have a devastating effect on our environment and hence economy. 
defaultIn our 
defaultopinion the major task of the department is to fundamentally change our transport systems; to move them from being run on fossil fuels to ones running on sustainable, clean energy; for public transport to be really accessible to all the public, not only in
default terms of coverage and capacity but in terms of price; public transport must be cheap enough for all to use. If these things are done then it will boost the 
defaultUK
default's long-term economic growth. 
default 
default&#xa0;
default26. The Strategic road network is vitally important to the econo
defaultmy and the way that it is managed can
default,
default and should
default,
default have a major impact on the 
defaultUK
default meeting the targets set out in the Climate Change Act. Why for example is there no mention of 
defaulttraffic 
defaultspeed in 
default“
defaultAction for Roads
default”
default? Managed motorways could be used to manage sp
defaulteed to both reduce fuel consumption and noxious emissions.
default 
default&#xa0;
default27. It remains the case that more deaths are caused by transport-related air pollution than by 
defaultroad traffic accidents. As the 
defaultHouse of Commons
default 
defaultEnvironmental Audit
default 
defaultCommittee
default report on Air quality published in March 2010 stated in the summary:
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultPoor air quality reduces the life expectancy of everyone in the 
defaultUK
default by an average of seven to eight months and up to 50,000 people a year may die prematurely because of it.
default”
default 
default……. 
default“
defaultTransp
defaultort causes the most exposure to harmful air pollutants, and air quality targets will not be met without a significant shift in transport policy.
default”
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultRoads policy should not therefore be treated in isolation from policies on demand management, land-use plann
defaulting, public transport and future technologies. 
defaultAny policy which diverts traffic from the strategic road network onto the local road network 
defaultshould not be contemplated.
default Transforming the Highways Agency into a 
defaultPubCo
default is such a policy.
