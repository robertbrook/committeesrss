[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;

[[[Introduction]]]&#xa0;1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Pact is the UK trade association representing and promoting the commercial interests of independent feature film, television, digital, children's and animation media companies.&#xa0;2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The UK independent television sector is one of the biggest in the world. Despite the difficult economic climate, independent television sector revenues have grown from £1.3 billion in 2005 to nearly £2.8 billion in 2012. &#xa0;3)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In 2012, the BBC spent £507 million on commissions from UK independent producers. This was an increase from £437m in 2011. The BBC commissioned 36% (37% in 2011-12) of eligible television content from external producers.&#xa0;4)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; BBC Commissions are important for independent producers as they account for 33% of all UK commissions, making the BBC the biggest buyer of content made by independent producers in the UK.&#xa0;5)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Pact is a supporter of the licence fee and recognises the important role that the BBC plays in British broadcasting. The BBC is also a leader on the world stage in terms of public services broadcasting. However, Pact highlights a number of areas in the submission where improvements could be made. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Executive Summary]]]&#xa0;Pact is a supporter of the BBC and the licence fee, recognising that it plays an important role in terms of both value to the UK economy and culture and promoting the British brand overseas. Removing or reducing the licence fee in any way could have negative repercussions for the broadcasting sector.&#xa0;In terms of the BBC achieving against its public purposes, Pact would like to see improvements in number of areas:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Beyond 2016, Pact would like to see more of the BBC licence fee invested in content. &#xa0;The BBC should become a publisher/ broadcaster. The WoCC (Window of Creative Competition) should not act as a cap on external commissions and the BBC should opt for the best programme regardless of whether this is produced in-house or by an independent producer (excluding news).&#xa0;Pact supports the licence fee in order to fund the BBC beyond 2016. The licence fee is one of the key drivers in the creation of intellectual property in the UK which can then be exploited overseas, creating and sustaining thousands of jobs within the UK broadcasting industry. Any redistribution of the licence fee would seriously erode the ability of the BBC to act as a corner stone of excellence. Such a move would limit its risk taking without any demonstrable benefits to the overall UK broadcasting ecology.&#xa0;

[[[Mission and purpose]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; What should the BBC be for and what should be the purpose of public service broadcasting?•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; How well has the BBC performed in the current Charter period in achieving its mission and public purposes? -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Are the public purposes in the current Charter the right ones? How might they change?1.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The purpose of the BBC and public service television broadcasting should be to create excellent and innovative content across a range of programme genres. It should act as a benchmark for the commercial sector by setting the creative standard for other PSB and commercial channels in the UK and increasingly abroad.1.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The BBC must continue to take risks and invest in drama, comedy and entertainment; taking risks that may be more difficult for commercial broadcasters. This helps to identify new talent that the whole industry benefits from. The BBC must also maintain its world-class reputation for factual content.1.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Pact is a supporter of the BBC and the licence fee, recognising that the BBC brings both economic benefits to the UK economy and influence or ‘soft power’ as part of its role in promoting the British brand overseas. The benefits attached to the licence fee are reflected in the value of the services provided and the wider economic benefit to the UK.1.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The BBC is an integral part of UK life and its editorial output is an important part of British culture and society. Any policy which diminishes the licence fee further could result in the loss of a number of positive multiplier effects. The BBC and other PSBs set broadcasting standards for other media channels in the UK and worldwide. Arguably, this is positive for UK creativity and innovation in the wider creative industries too. Quality PSB programming is clearly something that UK audiences appreciate hence the significant investments by Cable and Satellite channels into high quality original programming that is often indistinguishable from that provided by licensed PSB channels.1.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In terms of achieving its mission and public purposes, the BBC has performed well against its public purposes over the current Charter period. With regard to ‘sustaining citizenship and civil society’, the BBC should continue its excellence in coverage of news and current affairs and factual programming. On ‘stimulating cultural creativity and excellence’, it should continue to inspire creativity, innovation and talent across a range of genres. On ‘bringing the UK to the world and the world to the UK’, we will touch on in the submission the value of the BBC overseas and the increase in TV exports.1.6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The current public purposes remain broadly well targeted but Pact would like to see improvements in the following areas:Promoting education and learning1.7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The recent BBC Trust Review of Children’s Services report revealed that funding for children’s programming has not been ring fenced and faces budget cuts. In this regard, it is concerning that the BBC has emerged as the last dominant investor and buyer of children’s programming over recent years, with ITV and Channel 4 playing a noticeably lesser role in this space.1.8.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In light of this, the Government should, on the back of the success of tax credits for film, high end TV and animation, look into providing appropriate fiscal incentives to support children’s programming into the future. Investment in children’s programming is important in developing and sustaining British culture and language and a generation of viewers that will enjoy content from the BBC and public service broadcasters into the future.1.9.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Since the publication of the BBC Trust report, Pact is engaged in further discussions with the BBC around improving communication and transparency in the commissioning process and also investigating future funding options for children’s programming, for example, through collaboration with other channels.&#xa0;Representing the nations, regions, communities1.10.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Pact will continue to the monitor the BBC’s progress towards the target of realising 50% of network television by spend, outside London, by 2016. This target, set by the BBC Trust, includes 17% to be spent in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland respectively. We are pleased to see that the BBC is on schedule to achieve this with 46% of spend achieved out of London and just under 16% in the devolved countries. The progress made on out of London spend will help contribute towards the sustained and organic growth of the sector across the UK.&#xa0;1.11.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In terms of diversity, BBC programming content should reflect the diversity of licence fee payers in England and across the devolved countries. It seems that there is still further work to do in terms of appealing to viewers in lower income brackets and particularly the 16-24 age range within that. Delivering the benefits of emerging communications technologies1.12.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Pact is pleased that IPlayer has emerged as a world standard for IPTV (Internet Protocol TV) that other UK channels and broadcasters globally are keen to emulate. Pact recognises the volume of investment that was injected into fully realising this project.1.13.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Pact is keen that any future projects tapping into new technologies should be developed in collaboration with the industry and not separately. We expand on this theme later in the submission. 

[[[Scope, scale and remit]]]•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; What scope, scale and remit should the BBC have?-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Should the BBC’s output and services be provided to any greater or lesser degree for particular audiences? What balance should be struck in what the BBC produces in-house, commissions externally and leaves entirely to others to create?&#xa0;2.1 The key issue for Pact is, what is an appropriate balance for the BBC to strike between production in-house and external commissions. &#xa0;2.2 Pact would reiterate the point made in previous submissions that the BBC should primarily be a publisher-broadcaster (apart from the news which should be retained). All demand for programming could be filled and supplied by the market, driving efficiency savings in the BBC, releasing more funds to invest in high quality content and providing other benefits to the broader UK Television industry.&#xa0;2.3 Beyond Charter Renewal in 2016, Pact would like to see more funding released to the wider supply market. We would like to see the BBC always able to opt for the best programme regardless of who the supplier is. This will ensure that the BBC focusses on securing the best ideas at the best price from the market and the market will absorb the costs that currently are met by the BBC servicing a large fixed cost base of personnel and facilities.&#xa0;2.4 The BBC can easily ensure continuity of supply by entering into long running agreements as it currently does for a number of key programming strands such as Question Time and Waterloo Road made by an Independent and non Independent production company respectively.&#xa0;2.5 Adopting a publisher/ broadcaster approach could have the potential of a ‘big bang’ effect and contribute to the further development of the UK TV industry. This would be good for the market overall, creating savings for the BBC and far from displacing talent, it would release talent that could be utilised by the BBC, other PSBs and commercial broadcasters driving further competition and innovation.&#xa0;2.6 Licence fee payers will continue to demand more value, more quality and more options in the future. BBC ratings show that top Indie shows are amongst the most popular e.g. Sherlock, Master Chef, The Voice and others. In 2012, UK Indies won half of all TV Baftas (12 out of 24).&#xa0;2.7 The BBC is well placed to meet the needs of licence fee payers but to do so it has to ensure that its primary focus is on delivering the most creative, high quality programming that they can provide while driving down the BBC's cost base in order to continue to invest in original UK content across all genres.&#xa0;•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; How have the BBC’s commercial activities during the current Charter fitted with the BBC’s public purposes and have they achieved an adequate return for licence fee payers? What should be the aims, scope and scale of such activities beyond 2016?2.6 BBC Worldwide from the BBC’s commercial arm is an important distributor of content. Looking to the future, BBC Worldwide should remain focused, based on its current remit and continue to operate as trading body at arms length. Its operations should remain clear and commercially transparent. Potentially, by opening up opportunities through the WoCC, BBC Worldwide could have more opportunities as the distributor of a broader rights base.&#xa0;

[[[Developing technology]]]•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; What role should the BBC play in developing technology and new ways of distributing content?&#xa0;1.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Graf Report published in 2005, reviewed BBC online and set out that the BBC had failed to use the licence fee to support the digital production sector. Opportunities were not taken at the time and issues were raised around external commissioning.1.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In some ways, eight years later the position has not sufficiently improved. There is still work to do in creating a fully 21st century digital production sector. Pact’s submission to the BBC Trust’s Online Service review outlined concerns, amongst others, around:•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The fact that the online quota is largely met by commissioning several pieces of low value content and services from many different external suppliers. This suggests outsourcing is happening rather than a genuine investment by the BBC on content, services and technology from external suppliers•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The decision made by the BBC Executive not to introduce a digital WoCC, allowing independent producers to access more opportunities beyond the 25% quota.&#xa0;3.3 Pact would be sceptical about future attempts made by the BBC to introduce any significant or new technical solutions without the involvement of the wider industry. Significant investment went into developing the technology behind IPlayer from scratch. At some point in the future, an IPlayer refresh may take place in order to make the service and contents more relevant and user friendly.3.4 Faced with the future option of developing new technology or buying a solution off the shelf from an established digital company, Pact would welcome the BBC taking the opportunity to partner with digital companies and use expertise and solutions that are already being developed, to save investment costs where possible.&#xa0;3.5 The Charter allows for development in new technology platforms and we would want to see this provision continue into the future, preferably as already articulated, investing in solutions already being developed. Pact also recognises, as does the BBC, that further work will need to be done working with digital companies to integrate the BBC’s service offering with existing and future social media platforms.&#xa0;3.6 In terms of digital identifiers, the BBC should move quickly to introduce digital identifiers for content. The BBC’s Digital Media Initiative failed earlier in the year after £100m was invested into the project. Digital identifiers in the form of ISAN (the international audio visual standard) have already been developed by the industry. BBC should look into integrating and using this international standard for registering audio visual works rather than going down an alternative route.&#xa0;

[[[Funding beyond 2016]]]•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; How should the BBC be funded beyond 2016? Is there a case for distributing funding for public service content more widely beyond the BBC? What comparisons can be made with the provision of public service content in other countries? 4.1 Pact is strong supporter of the BBC licence fee; this is essential for the delivery of quality broadcasting in the future and should be protected. The licence fee which is channelled into BBC programming also acts as seed funding driving the creation of British intellectual property. The licence fee gives the UK a competitive advantage and a platform into international markets, creating and sustaining thousands of jobs in the process.&#xa0;4.2 The BBC is the envy of public broadcasters around the world and a recent report underlines the value of the BBC in creating and selling Britain’s ‘soft power’ overseas. The report demonstrated that cultural factors such as language, creativity and values contribute to the UK’s attractiveness as a source of overseas trade and investment and that:•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; People who consume BBC services more frequently have more favourable perceptions of the UK•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The more business leaders know and consume the BBC, the more likely they are to trade with the UK.&#xa0;4.3 The success of the current regime is demonstrated in the fact that TV exports have more than doubled over the last few years. The most recent Pact/UKTI Export report shows that UK TV exports continue to rise and were up 4% overall to £1,178m in 2012. The main markets are the US and Europe but with strong growth in China (+90%), Indonesia (+81%) and India (+42%) and future potential in other markets also.4.4 In terms of funding beyond 2016, Pact would support an appropriate annual increment to the licence fee. This may be in line with, or higher than, inflation taking into account the changing economic environment. Pact would be concerned that a failure to secure future funding for the BBC would erode the budget for future original content which is a driver of IP creation.&#xa0;4.5 Pact is opposed to any redistribution of the licence fee to other broadcasters. The BBC has integrated the licence fee into its business plan and operating model and demonstrated that it can create, deliver and sustain high quality content over a period of time. By redistributing this fee to other broadcasters, the current impact of the Public Service Broadcaster would be lost.&#xa0;4.6 Competition amongst the broadcasters is important to drive creativity and innovation. By replacing the licence fee with advertising revenue in any way would damage the BBC’s unique service model. The BBC drives the world’s best TV industry which is vastly different from similar sized countries such as Italy with RaiUno. The competition angle is important in sustaining future success in the sector.&#xa0;

[[[Governance, Regulation and accountability]]]•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; How should the BBC be governed, regulated and held accountable beyond 2016?-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Does a 10-year Royal Charter and Agreement with the Secretary of State, together, provide the most appropriate constitutional framework for the BBC?5.1 Pact agrees that there should continue to be an appropriate governance structure that holds the BBC management to account. A ten year Charter that provides continuity and a strategic view, agreed by the Government, is still the most appropriate constitutional framework.&#xa0;&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0; Pact Census Independent Production Sector Financial Census and Survey 2013, by Oliver &amp; Ohlbaum Associates Ltd (June 2013) Pact Census Independent Production Sector Financial Census and Survey 2013, by Oliver &amp; Ohlbaum Associates Limited (June 2013) BBC Annual Report 2012-13 The Economic Return to the UK of the BBC’s Global Footprint (Nov 2013)
