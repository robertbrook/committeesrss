[normal]Summary[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Publicly funded and collected 
[normal]data 
[normal]can have a significant value for economic growth, for health and for society more broadly. The Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and the 
[normal]Medical Research Council (MRC) are committed to 
[normal]the RCUK Common Principles on Data Policy
[normal], which set out an overarching framework for individual research councils’ data policies
[normal] 
[normal]. The RCUK principles 
[normal]recognise that publicly funded research data are a public good, produced in the public interest and should be made openly available with a
[normal]s
[normal] few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner.  Research data generated by research council funding must be discoverable, accessible and usable. In addition to funding research programmes which generate data
[normal],
[normal] the research councils also support infrastructure, build capacity in key disciplines and deliver a policy framework for data sharing and preservation which ensure the research community and others can maximise the value of data.

[normal]              
[normal]As noted in the introduction above, the research councils are committed to the principle that publicly-funded data should be openly available to the maximum extent possible, this may include open-data publication or some form of managed access to ensure data are safe. 
[normal] 
[normal] It is also important to ensure
[normal] that 
[normal]data made open
[normal] 
[normal]are
[normal] used and re-used by suitably qualified, trained and experienced researchers as effectively as possible
[normal]; this is
[normal] in order to 
[normal]maintain the integrity of the data and to ensure the trust of research participants, both of which are essential to 
[normal]maximise its contribution to informing public policy and services
[normal]. This is particularly important when bringing together data produced by different government departments or public bodies where individual’s identities may inadvertently be discoverable; thus suitable governance arrangements may need to considered to undertake cross-departmental analyses.
