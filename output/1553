default&#xa0; 
defaultOngoing comments made
default by bus users on websites reveals much about the levels of satisfaction amongst users. My own research backs up what is being said. 
default1.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultI have answered your six specific questions and have made further comments in paragraph 8. I would be happy to enlarge upon
default any of the comments made. 
default1.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultMost of the comments made relate to bus services. By and large the train services adhere to national standards whether they operate in rural areas or not. Bus services in cities are able to operate fairly successfully under curr
defaultent legislation. Bus services in rural areas frequently offer very poor value for money indeed.
default1.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultI hope you will find my comments of interest.
default&#xa0;
default2.1 How do Government and local authorities identify demand?default 
default2.2 These comments relate to the situation in Wales
default. The variation in research is huge. The Welsh Government carries out an annual National Transport Survey. Public transport users in rural areas are rarely asked directly for their view by officials. Local authorities have widely different priorities.
default2.3 
defaultBus Users UK (Wales) do hold surgeries around the country but only by invitation 
defaulteg
default by the local authority. Passenger Focus carries out surveys on trains but admit that it’s hard to carry these out on rural services due to time constraints. All in all, the
defaultre is not a coherent official set of statistics pertaining to rural public transport.
default&#xa0;
default3.1 To what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers taken into account? default3.2 The following comments relate to bus services and community transport.
default3.3 Cu
defaultrrent bus users are mainly elderly, young people who haven’t passed their driving test yet or can’t afford to drive, young mothers, people with a variety of disabilities – often with mental health problems, poorer people; in short, the disadvantaged. Peopl
defaulte like myself, who choose bus use for conscientious reasons, are rare. 
default3.4 Any survey done specifically to find out how rural bus transport can be improved would gain the views of these disadvantaged people. As stated in the previous paragraph, these surv
defaulteys are not carried out. 
default3.5 Voluntary groups such as Ceredigion Association of Voluntary Organisations (CAVO) do have wide knowledge and try to address specific problems such as organising hospital transport. In Ceredigion CAVO has also introduced a whee
defaultlchair-adapted vehicle to their service, which can be hired. 
default&#xa0;
default4.1 What are the challenges with providing better bus and train services in rural areas?default4.2 The challenges are really the same as elsewhere. The only difference is that there are bigger gaps
default between the stops. 
default4.3 Where train lines are still operating, trains are very overcrowded, especially at certain times of the year. Extra services can be made part of a new franchise. 
default4.4.1 Where train lines have been closed, buses must fulfil their rol
defaulte. The Welsh Government has a strategy for putting on long distance fast services in preference to renewing rail tracks. This strategy has been only partly successful. 
default4.4.2 One of the failures is due to the cost of the tender. Operators have found themse
defaultlves unable to meet the demands set. 
default4.4.3 Another failure has been due to the supplanting of existing services that are hail and ride – they stop in small villages, at farm gates, etc – with a service that shoots past the very people who patronised the p
defaultrevious service. As a result many rural dwellers have lost their service.
default4.4.4 So the challenge is in how to increase patronage whilst not losing the current crop of users. 
default&#xa0;
default5.1 How effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengdefaulters?default5.2 Community Transport is variable. It is very good in some places and poor in others. It is good at helping a certain type of customer but not good at operating in a certain geographical area. 
default5.3 Users see themselves as charity cases. Drivers are usually volunteers. This does not make users feel comfortable. 
default5.4 Community Transport is often a sticking plaster and is not the answer. 
default&#xa0;
default6.1 To what extent should people in isolated communities reldefaulty on taxis and demand-responsive transport services?default6.2 Taxis are mainly run by individuals or small companies. In Ceredigion a number of them operate 8 to 10 
defaultseaters
default. Taxis are expensive for individual users as they do not form part of a coherent system 
defaultof public transport provision. This issue needs addressing.
default6.3.1 There is a demand-responsive service that operates here called 
defaultBwcabus
default. It is hailed by its architect as the answer to all rural transport problems. However, local experience shows it to be 
defaulta financial burden to the taxpayer, and to be operating in a most inefficient manner, which causes it to be unpopular. 
default6.3.2 The set-up of 
defaultBwcabus
default is too complicated. There are too many bodies involved: two local authorities, two regional transport consor
defaulttia, the Welsh Government, the University of Glamorgan, 
defaultTraveline
default 
defaultCymru
default and the European Union. 
default6.3.3 Freedom of information (FOI) requests have shown the cost of this 
defaultBwcabus
default scheme to be out of all proportion to the benefits for customers. Its own websi
defaultte purports to have a budget of £2.9million. It has been revealed by the FOI that massive sums have been put in from the various taxpayers’ purses, be it via local authority, Welsh Government or European funding, whilst only a small fraction has been forth
defaultcoming from the users. In 2012, the operator took just over £10,000 from customers, most of that amount from reimbursement of people’s bus passes.  In that same year, the University of Glamorgan was paid £91,187.86 in fees.  These figures merely illustrate
default the gross inadequacy of the system from a financial point of view. 
default6.3.4 The 
defaultBwcabus
default scheme is also mixed up with various scheduled services. These scheduled services can be accessed by anybody without previously booking; the rest has to be booked in adv
defaultance. The system is cumbersome and is set up in such a way as to have a high failure rate. As a consequence, these buses are seen sitting empty in lay-bys for many hours each day. 
default6.4 Most people in rural areas live in sizeable communities along major tra
defaultnsport corridors. These can be reached by normal scheduled services. Those that live in more remote parts would be better served by taxis; hence the need to make taxis part of the system as a whole.
default&#xa0;
default7.1 What are the main challenges associated with fundingdefault rural public transport?default7.2 The Welsh Government has cut the subsidies on buses. The jury is still out how many services will be lost as a result. So far, users report loss of early and late services and loss of Sunday services. 
default7.3.1There are huge ineff
defaulticiencies in the current system. For example, most children get to school by bus in rural Wales. School buses are mostly used for transporting children to and from school. Consequently these vehicles only run in term times and are sitting idle most of the 
defaultday. Social services operate their own vehicles, often with just one or two customers on board. 
default7. 3.2 There needs to be a reappraisal of how such vehicles are deployed. There are some good examples of how this can be done. One local operator (Lloyds Coac
defaulthes from 
defaultMachynlleth
default) sells seats to the local authority to transport pupils instead of coaches. This works out much cheaper. Many of the pupils can be transported on scheduled services. The trouble has been with the lack of seatbelts. Again, Lloyds Coache
defaults has managed to overcome this issue by having seatbelts on all their vehicles. 
default&#xa0;
default8.1 Additional commentsdefault8.2 Competition between bus operators does not make for an efficient and cost effective service for passengers in rural areas. There simply is not eno
defaultugh patronage per mile covered. A different model is needed. Many people wish to see a repeal of the 1985 Transport Act so that government departments and local authorities can step in to sort out the current awful state of affairs. They wish to see reregu
defaultlation of the buses. 
default8.3 My experience is that certain private operators have a better grip on what works than local authorities and government officials. These operators know their customers. However, they don’t want to take risks with 
defaulteg
default evening service
defaults as they are clearly worried about the bottom line. The best private operators are medium sized ones (
defaulteg
default Lloyds Coaches as mentioned in par 7.3.2). Large countrywide operators have little incentive to provide a good service; their managements are too remo
defaultte.
default8.4.1 Franchising might be a way forward, offering whole regions for a certain number of years. Franchises would have to include a) research on customers’ needs including the vulnerable; b) the delivery of a minimum level of service to include early mo
defaultrning, late evening, Sunday, remote communities, etc; c) 
defaultaspirational
default growth of customer figures that would need to be achieved in order to avoid financial penalties; d) 
defaultaspirational
default service delivery standards including reliability and punctuality, deliver
defaulty of information, etc; e) 
defaultaspirational
default standards on quality of vehicles in use with clear dates for delivery of these 
defaulteg
default 
defaultall vehicles to be low floor, have seatbelts, have 
defaultwi-fi
default, etc. Again, for points do and e, financial penalties have to be stringent.
default8.
default4.2 Franchisees could offer a mix of vehicles and services from scheduled hourly services between major centres to demand-responsive and taxi services. One side of the business that is more profitable could offset the more costly side of the service. There
default are operators in Wales who could deliver such a package right now. 
default&#xa0;
default9 Conclusiondefault&#xa0;defaultThere are changes to rural bus services that could be delivered without any changes in the law although operators would find things easier if the law on competition does al
defaultter. As the law stands currently, passengers lose out. That surely was never the intention of the legislators. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe most important change needed is a change of culture. Bus passengers in rural areas need to be regarded as citizens with rights and not as e
defaultither expensive burdens who deserve only the crumbs nor as charity cases. Neither do we need to see the complete opposite as in the needlessly expensive and cumbersome 
defaultBwcabus
default project that is resulting in public finances being spent not on front-line servi
defaultces but on needless bureaucracy.
