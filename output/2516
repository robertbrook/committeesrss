Written evidence submitted by Mr John Ford (LAI 0057)[bold]1. There is a serious misuse of statistics in the consultation paper.  There have been many complaints about this because the public have been misled.  Legal action 
[normal]was 
[normal]contemplated.  The 
[normal]Government has not sought to make a defence to these criticisms.
[normal]2.  For a document which claims to put forward proposals for saving money it is notewo
[normal]r
[normal]thy that  there is no suggestion as to how money or expenditure might be saved without a serious erosion
[normal] of rights of access to the courts and an increased threat to the rule of law.
[normal]3. Research evidence is already showing that the diminution of take up of legal aid which is still available despite LASPO is so significant that tens of millions at least will 
[normal]be saved irrespective of the proposed measures.  In my view this is principally due to
[normal](a) Politicians (including the Lord Chancellor) talking down the value of legal aid
[normal](b) Serious failure to advertise and promote legal aid
[normal](c)
[normal] Potential users wrongly be
[normal]lieving that even if L/A was available they would not be eligible.
[normal]4
[normal].  The position of legal aid lawyers and their clients is not very different from that of the miners and their families in 1984.  They faced, as do we, a government determined to undermine
[normal] and exclude the people who were opposed to its policies.  This proposal has nothing to do with perceived financial savings in a time of austerity.  It is a direct ideological challenge designed to make our society less equal.
[normal]5
[normal]. A well known 
[normal]QC recently s
[normal]tated at a public meeting:
[normal]"If this ministry is worthy of its name and is fit for purpose....... then it must be persuaded to ditch these reprehensible proposals."
[normal]I endorse those remarks.
[normal]6. I respectfully refer to the impressive response prepared by Dr. 
[normal]Nick Armstrong and attach a copy for ease of reference.
