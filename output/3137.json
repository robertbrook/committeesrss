"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Bailey Pollock Electrical Services Ltd I watched the recent Committee meeting where you took evidence from Certsure, Napit\n and others over the single register. As a registered electrician, I have a number of concerns on this matter and how it is currently operated. \n&#xa0;\nPut simply my main concerns are:\nI would advocate and support a single register but not by a body such as the NICEIC. \n&#xa0;\nI hope this information is of some use to you and I will be very ha\nppy to provide further information or explanation should you need it.\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
