[normal]Written evidence[bold] from the Education Committee[bold] [bold](SCE0003)[bold]A – How the Education Committee has responded to the Committee’s best practice recommendations
[normal]Purpose
[normal]Several of the Education Committee’s reports in the last 12 months have had a direct or indirect influence on Government policy.  Our pre-legislative scrutiny of the clauses relating to special educational needs in the draft Children and Families bill had a demonstrable impact on departmental thinking.  
[normal]Our report on child protection was acknowledged as one of the prompts for the Secretary of State for Education’s first major speech on that issue in November 2012 in which he responded directly to our recommendation that Ministers should encourage public awareness of the value of care.  The Secretary of State described our report as an “
[normal]excellent analysis which richly repays reading
[normal]”.
[normal]Following the publication of our Eighth Report, 
[normal]From GCSEs to EBCs: the Government’s proposals for reform
[normal], the Government announced that it was no longer intending to replace GCSEs but that it would look to reform the exam. It also announced that it would defer the timetable for market reform, thereby meeting a central criticism in our report.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Strategic planning
[normal]The Education Committee held an 
[normal]awayday
[normal] in September 2012. The purpose of this event was for the Committee to have a discussion about our focus for the remain
[normal]der of the Parliament. We concluded that our focus would be on the “long tail of underachievement” in education and that this theme would run through all of our inquiries. The Committee also agreed that a balance should be struck in inquiries between the two sides of the Department for Education’s responsibilities: education and children’s services.
[normal]As part of the 
[normal]awayday
[normal] we invited key players in the education and children’s services field to discuss the upcoming priorities, as they saw them, for the Committee. The invitees included education journalists, the president of the Association of Directors of Children’s Services, the CEO of an Academy chain, the NAO and a varied group of academics. The views of these stakeholders fed into the Committee’s brainstorming of future inquiry themes.
[normal]The Committee routinely considers the option of commissioning research as part of the process for selecting inquiries. To date we have not identified an appropriate area for outside research.
[normal]Focus of inquiries
[normal]The Committee also routinely considers a communications plan before we launch an inquiry, as part of the scoping process. For example, we considered the opportunities to communicate with the media and with schools, teachers and pupils directly in its inquiry into School Sports following London 2012 (the Third Report of 2013-14). The timing of the inquiry was also considered as part of the communications plan: we published our Report to coincide with the first anniversary of the 2012 Games in order to attract media attention and to be most relevant to the public.
[normal]Evidence sessions
[normal]It is our standard practice to divide questions for each evidence session into blocks of specific issues to be pursued by individual members.  Often, a member may take the lead on a subject throughout an inquiry but we have not formalised this practice.
[normal]We make every effort to take evidence from a wide range of witnesses, including front-line practitioners and those affected by Government policies. For example, for our inquiry into SEN we heard from both parents and young people.  We also try to ensure that we call witnesses from different parts of the country to ensure geographical representation.
[normal]The number of oral evidence slots is inevitably limited so we also hold regular informal seminars to ensure that we have the opportunity to hear from an even more diverse range of voices.  In the last year, these have involved local authority officers dealing with home education, young people who have received careers guidance, school governors and experts in school readiness and early years.  Our work has also been informed by holding private seminars under the Chatham House rule with the key players in areas such as school accountability and exam reform.       
[normal]Professional development
[normal]The Committee sought feedback from guests at our 
[normal]awayday
[normal] regarding our effectiveness and ways of improving it. We also carried out a survey of previous oral witnesses to gather their views on the performance of the Committee in public evidence sessions. We used this information to review our performance.  We considered the benefits of using professional trainers to help develop our questioning skills but did not feel that this would be worth the expenditure at this time.     
[normal] 
[normal]Committee behaviour
[normal]All members of the Education Committee treat witnesses with respect and courtesy.  Our criticism of individuals has only been directed at Ministers who of course receive embargoed copies of reports.
[normal]Scrutiny of European matters
[normal]There is little European business relating to education and so the Committee decided not to appoint a European 
[normal]rapporteur
[normal].
[normal]Scrutiny of bills and secondary legislation
[normal]In the last twelve months we have undertaken pre-legislative scrutiny of the SEN provisions in the draft Children and Families bill.  We have continued to take an interest in this legislation as it makes its passage through Parliament, including writing to the Minister for clarification on key points. 
[normal]Reports
[normal]Since the Liaison Committee made its recommendations, the Education Committee has followed the best practice guidelines and identified our conclusions and recommendations by use of bold and bold italics respectively. We also clearly indicate to whom each recommendation is addressed and ensure that the conclusions and recommendations can be understood as stand-alone paragraphs. In drafting our reports, the Committee seeks to make them as succinct and accessible as possible. 
[normal]Government responses
[normal]We consider any Government response alongside staff analysis of where recommendations have been accepted, rejected or inadequately handled.  Although some responses have been weak, we have decided to follow these up in future debates or evidence sessions rather than through special reports.   
[normal]Follow-up
[normal] We routinely appoint a member to lead on the follow-up to each inquiry. It is also our established practice to reconsider an inquiry a year on from the report to decide on further action.  At the minimum, where appropriate, this has resulted in our requesting a memorandum from the Department for Education on developments and progress in implementing our recommendations.  These memoranda are published on our website.   
[normal]The Education Committee has recently held two oral evidence sessions to follow up on our Ninth Report of 2010-12, 
[normal]Great Teachers: attracting, training and retaining the best
[normal].
[normal] We are also planning two sessions to follow-up on our work on child protection.
[normal] Debates
[normal]A debate was held in Westminster Hall on the Committee’s Seventh Report of 2012-13, 
[normal]Careers guidance for young people
[normal].  The Committee’s report on pre-legislative scrutiny of the draft Children and Families bill was tagged as being of relevance to the second reading and consideration stages of the Bill itself. 
[normal]The Committee launched its report on the reform of the examinations system, 
[normal]From GCSEs to EBCs: the Government’s proposals for reform
[normal], on the floor of the House. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]B – How the Education Committee has approached the revised core tasks
[normal]Task 1 – Strategy
[normal]The Education Committee has held four oral evidence sessions with the Secretary of State, including two where the 
[normal]DfE’s
[normal] Permanent Secretary also gave evidence. The focus of two sessions in the early months of 2013 was on the effectiveness of the administration of the 
[normal]DfE
[normal].
[normal]The Committee’s third Report of 2012-13, 
[normal]Governance and leadership of the Department for Education
[normal], examined the effectiveness of the Departmental Board and made recommendations as to how it could improve. 
[normal]Task 2 – Policy
[normal]Many of the Committee’s inquiries have dealt with areas of emerging policy. For example both its Careers Guidance for young people inquiry and that into School sports following London 2012 focused on the effects of new policy approaches in these areas. 
[normal]The Committee has also looked at more established policy matters, such as Sure Start children’s centres, home education, the role of school governors and the problem of asbestos in schools through one-off evidence sessions as well as full inquiries.
[normal]Task 3 – Expenditure and performance
[normal]The Committee has requested expert analysis of the Department for Education’s Estimates from the Scrutiny Unit. We have then used this analysis both to further our own understanding and to provide the basis of further scrutiny of the Estimates, which it has done in writing. 
[normal]Task 4 – Draft Bills
[normal]The Committee undertook a detailed scrutiny of provisions of the draft Children and Families Bill that related to Special Educational Needs. The Sixth Report of Session 2012-13, 
[normal]Pre-legislative scrutiny – Special Educational Needs
[normal], concluded that while the general thrust of the draft clauses was sound, the legislation lacked necessary detail.
[normal]Task 8 – Appointments
[normal]The Committee scrutinised the proposed appointment of the Chair of the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission in July 2012. There have been no relevant appointments proposed by the Secretary of State for Education since that date.   
[normal]Task 10 – Public engagement
[normal]The Committee’s inquiry into school sports involved engagement with the public – specifically teachers and school children. This was done through inviting responses to an online survey – the survey was advertised on Twitter – and also by the Committee holding a discussion with young people on Twitter about their experiences of school sport.  The Committee successfully engaged with teachers and young people in this way and used their views to inform its inquiry. 
[normal]The Committee worked with the BBC School Report, which used school children to report on the progress of the inquiry. Committee members were interviewed by the children and footage was taken of the Committee’s visit to a secondary school in East London.  The BBC posted a series of reports and interviews about the inquiry on its website, all of which were aimed at and accessible to young people. 
[normal]The Committee has an established Twitter account with nearly 2,500 followers.
[normal]We have also continued to take formal evidence away from Westminster where possible to increase public awareness of our work. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]C – The Education Committee’s experience of obstacles
[normal]We have not experienced any significant obstacles that have hampered our work.  We have, however, observed that there is a regular pattern of requests from the Department for extensions to deadlines and some unacceptable delays in confirming witnesses or responding to our requests. 
[normal]There also appears to be a declining awareness of the role of select committees and of Parliament. In most cases, we have resolved this to our satisfaction but we will keep a close eye on the situation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]D – Innovation or good practice
[normal]The Committee’s work in using Twitter to engage with young people in its school sports inquiry as well as using online surveys to add to its evidence for inquiries has been innovative and is something that the Committee will repeat in the future. Our work with the BBC School Report team is also likely to be repeated with other inquiries in the future.
[normal]Among our other innovations, we highlight our evidence session with former 
[normal]DfE
[normal] Ministers which we held a few months after their departure from Government.  We found this session highly informative and thought-provoking, and would certainly consider repeating it where appropriate.
