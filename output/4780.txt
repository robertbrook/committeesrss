[[[Future of the BBC]]]&#xa0;Quite simply.Why should I have to pay for a BBC which seems to be decadent in so many ways?£145 is a lot of money. All they seem to do is Empire build; books magazines travel.Never mind the other aspects of their bad behaviour the bias etc the leaning towardone pro-permissive agenda to the exclusion of common taste and decency.&#xa0;I have watched TV since 1952 I was ten years old. I think I am well placed tocomment. I have phoned the BBC on many occasions over this last 50 years theymake it difficult unless one is very determined.&#xa0;A few years ago they have the cheek to install an answer phone system. Before thenone could at least speak to a person. Who sometimes at the height of the permissiveera the early 1970, s could be rude and argumentative. Were they having so manycomplaints that they could not handle the volume? I wonder.&#xa0;There is still a large section of Society which abhors the foul language the 'f’ wordetc that they continue to broadcast to the detriment o four young people who oftenthink that this is the norm. I venture to say. It is not!&#xa0;Public service broadcasting in my opinion should be a good example to our society.all aspects of it. It should not shock in any way.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
