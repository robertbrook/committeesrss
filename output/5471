defaultThere has been a significant change in the expected scope of these rules b
defaultetween the consultation document issued on 20 May 2013 and the draft provisions in the Finance Bill. 
defaultFor example, as regards the provision on ‘disguised employment’, both Conditions A 
default(‘disguised salary’) 
defaultand C 
default(capital contribution requirement) 
defaultare differ
defaultent from the proposals in the consultation document.  
defaultSection 2.13 of the May consultation document states: 
default10.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default‘
defaultThese conditions are not intended to apply to members who are in essence partners of a traditional partnership that is now carried on as an LLP. T
defaulthis means they are not intended to affect the status of members who carry on the partnership in common with a view to profit, who take risk in the business and who are to a significant degree rewarded on the 
defaultbasis of a share in the profits. They are also n
defaultot intended to affect the status of persons who are taken on as members at an appropriate point in their career in recognition of their professional knowledge and personal skills, and who sacrifice an entitlement to salary in exchange for the opportunity t
defaulto participate in the business in much the same way as a senior partner, even if as junior partners they are substantially rewarded by a fixed profit share.

defaultThis approach has not been followed, and has instead been replaced with detailed mechanical tests w
defaulthich give rise to questions in practice in applying them.  As the consultation period 
defaultfor the 2014 Finance Bill 
defaultcloses on 4 February 2014, there is little time for affected LLPs to respond 
defaultto the consultation process 
defaulteffectively.

defaultThe potential impact of 
defaultmaking 
defaultsignificant
default changes o
defaultn how the rules on ‘salaried members’ will apply
default at a late stage in the legislative process creates uncertainty for affected businesses, means the draft provisions are not properly road tested to check they only counter the perc
defaulteived areas of mischief
default; thus seriously undermining the consultation process
default.
default  It also
default results in affected firms taking whatever remedial action to escape the legislation applying in situations where
default it ought never to have applied; creating unnecessary cos
defaultt and upheaval for businesses. 
default          
default10.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTake, for example, Condition A
default: the purpose of this condition is to identify those individuals who do not in reality have rights to the underlying profits of the business, so should not be taxed as self-employed.  
defaultThe condition is met if at least 80% 
defaultof the amounts payable to the individual are in the form of ‘disguised salary’.  Examples of payments which will be caught as disguised salary are fixed sums, payment for piecework, a bonus based on the individual’s own
default performance or just one part of the business, guaranteed profits and non-refundable drawings.
default  However, LLPs may have complex arrangements for awarding profits which have nothing whatsoever to do with tax avoidance.  This might include elements of profit 
defaultshare representing meeting personal performance targets (eg on winning new work) and the profitability of their own office/ sector, in addition to a share based on the overall success of the business as a whole.  As things stand, a number of these entirely
default commercially driven components of partners’ profits will be caught as ‘disguised salary’.  
defaultIndeed, the individual’s profit share may be a share of overall profits but that share will also be affected by personal performance – so where there is a combinati
defaulton of both, there is a lack of clarity and certainty in the provisions as drafted.
defaultStatutory Residence Test
default14.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe introduction of the 
defaultStatutory Residence Test (SRT) 
defaulthas gone some way towards 
defaultsimplifying what was previously a highly unsatisfactory 
defaultsituation that depended too little on legislation and too much on HMRC pr
defaultactice, resulting in uncertainty for many taxpayers. The process was, however unduly protracted and it did not ultimately produce legislation that meets the ideal of being simple to understand and apply. 
defaultIt is fair to say that the SRT now produces greater 
defaultcertainty for a greater number of taxpayers but there 
defaultremain
default situations where the complexity has been 
defaultsignificantly 
defaultincreased. 
default14.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn a matter as straightforward as the layout of the legislation, representations were not heeded: the legislation begins by refe
defaultrring to the first test to be applied as being the “First Automatic UK Test” but the first leg of that test is that the individual does not meet the tests of automatic non-residence.
default 
default14.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn the “ties” taken into account in determining residence
default,
default a 
defaultnew
default tie has
default been created, that of having one’s “home” or main home in the UK. 
defaultBoth the “old” test and the new take 
defaultaccount
default of an individual having accommodation available but that is different from a “home” which is 
defaultvery widely defined (Finance Act 2013 Sch. 45 Para.
default 25)
default but 
defaultthen subject to 
defaultcomment in HMRC’s booklet RDR3 which is
default extensive
default but not definitiv
defaulte
default, referring only to factor
defaults that might be taken into account. The result is that nowhere is there a test that a taxpayer can rely on
default.
default An example given by HMRC is
default 
defaulto
defaultf a mobile home or canal barge but what if the person does not have one such “home” but regularly rents different ones?
default14.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe greatest complexity arises in relation to individuals who work both in the UK and overseas and are required to count 
defaultdays and hours 
defaultof UK and overseas work in different ways for different parts of the tests.
default  
defaultInternational journeys can be especially problematical: apart from certain trivial actions that may be disregarded the nature of a journey can have a large bearing on status. For 
defaultexample:
default14.4.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaulttravel from a home outside the UK to work here is not relevant at all if no work is done during the journey but if more than a token amount of work is done on the journey, the entire journey counts as work done in the country where the journey beg
defaultan
default;
default14.4.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultdepending on circumstances travel between engagements may or may not count as work, again in the country where the journey begins; and
default14.4.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultinternationally
default mobile workers need to be able to establish where they were at midnight on any given day
default since days o
defaultf presence in the UK at midnight are counted when applying the statutory residence test.
default14.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn addition to recording where they are at midnight, the internationally mobile also need to record how many hours’ work they have done and precisely where. For exampl
defaulte, if an individual leaves 
defaultLondon at 
default9
default.00 pm on a 
defaultseven hour
default flight that is counted as work, perhaps because they are preparing for a meeting at their destination, they may not be counted as present in the UK 
defaulton either the day of departure or the following
default day but will be treated as having done three hours’ work in the UK on each of those days. The time-recording burden threatens to be extremely onerous.
default14.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe end result is that despite the fact that most of the SRT is good and largely fit for purpose, there 
defaultare narrow areas of deep uncertainty which are subject to interpretation by HMRC, necessitating the publication of lengthy guides RDR1 and RDR3
default which are advisory as to HMRC’s interpretation but do not have any legal force
default.
default Furthermore, despite the involvement of HMRC in the process of developing the SRT from when it was first proposed in the Budget of 2011, initially to come into force in April 2012 but deferred until 2013, guidance on HMRC’s interpretation is still only no
defaultw coming out. That is not a criticism of the legislative process in narrow terms but it is an indictment of the lack of joining-up between legislature and executive.
defaultGeneral Anti-Abuse Rule
default (GAAR)
default14.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe basic test in the GAAR is whether the tax arrangements 
defaultin question can be ‘reasonably regarded as a reasonable course of action in relation to the relevant tax provisions, having regard to all the circumstances…
default’
default  
default14.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA test requiring a view to be taken on ‘reasonableness’ 
defaultcreates uncertainty 
defaultas different people 
defaulthave different views on what is reasonable
default (and indeed it is necessary for the view itself to be tested as to whether it is reasonably held). 
default14.9
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHMRC has published extensive guidance on the GAAR with detailed examples, but these only scratch the surface of t
defaulthe issues tax advisers and their clients will have to 
defaultdeal
default with in practice
default.  The stated objective of the GAAR was to counter ‘egregious’ schemes, but
default 
defaultthe
defaultre is concern that the HMRC could
default 
defaultseek to apply it
default wider in practice.  
defaultFurthermore, there is no cleara
defaultnce facility 
defaultfor taxpayers to gain the required certainty
default.  There is likely to be little certainty for taxpayers for several years, until decisions of the Advisory Panel have been published.
default14.10
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe support the Government’s aim to curb abusive tax schemes, but 
defaultat the very least providing a clearance facility would have gone some way towards providing comfort to the vast majority of taxpayers who do not engage in abusive tax planning, but 
defaultwant the assurance that
default their proposed actio
defaultns will not be challenged under
default the GAAR.
