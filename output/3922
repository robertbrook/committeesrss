defaultSummary of key points:default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultSince the report was published in 2012 important improvements have been introduced, namely in the 
defaultCommitteesdefault’default web presencedefault. Improvements include much less reliance on text based material, with integration of image and audio-visual material, and a more effective representation of the committees’ people and activity; for example the access to information about the Members of the committees is now much clearer, but also more visually effective, and the integration of Twitter feeds helps give a sense of what is happening in the committee. These changes help the committees’ pages to communicate more effectively the wide ranging and ongoing work they carry out, making their work seem more relevant and directly linked to society and citizens’ issues. The wide range of type of material also helps engaging a wider audience, beyond the academic expert. Despite this overall improvement in web presence, there is some inconsistency of practice between committees, with some having much more up-to-date material. These improvements need also be followed up by a more active dissemination of the page to target audiences, as interested parties would not naturally go to these pages. The more active dissemination to target audiences seems to be happening already, but I am not able to comment on the extent of this.
default&#xa0;
defaultLinked to this point, some committees have also improved their 
defaultsocial media presencedefault, but again this still varies considerably from committee to committee. An increasing number of committees now have a Twitter account. This is mainly used for announcement and information type of messages, rather than for engaging. More effective engagement is taking place through individual Members’ use of social media, linked to the
defaultir work in committee. The #AskG
defaultove initiative has not been followed up by a more extensive use of similar ideas and the recommendation of a wider use of social media tools for engagement does not seem to have developed much further than ensuring a presence in social media. This should not be disregarded, but more can be done. An interesting example of utilizing social media to extend the reach of and engagement of 
defaultcommittee work can be found in both chambers of the Brazilian parliament, through their platforms 
defaultE-Democracia
default (lower chamber) and 
defaultE-Cidadania
default (Senate). These tools serve a number of purposes, one of them being to facilitate questions from the public to the committee, whilst in session. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTwo areas that could improve further are: 
defaultbetter presence of the committee outside Westminsterdefault and 
defaultbetter integration with schoolsdefault’default resources and contacts. The UK Parliament has excellent Education services, but this is sometimes limited to static material. The work of select committees could be better integrated with educational resources. Whilst new media can facilitate a much wider reach of the committees beyond Westminster, actually going to other locations can have considerably more effect. All committees should aim to visit other locations on a recurrent basis, even if not frequent. This would not necessarily need to be done by the whole committee, it could be associated to trips by individuals such as the Chair, for fact finding and for dissemination. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is acknowledged that the time period since the report was issued is not long enough to allow for considerable development in these areas. The fact that some improvements have already taken place should therefore be praised.
