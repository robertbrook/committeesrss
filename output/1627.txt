[[[1.0 About Guide Dogs]]]1.1 Guide Dogs provides mobility and rehabilitation services for blind and partially sighted people in the UK, delivered through 20 local mobility teams. The guide dog service involves the training and provision of assistance dogs to blind and partially sighted people, working with both guide dog and owner to create a successful partnership through which the individual can become as independently mobile as possible. &#xa0;1.2 Alongside our mobility work we campaign to break down physical and legal barriers to help blind and partially sight people to get around on their own. Current estimates suggest two million people with sight loss in the UK of which around 360,000 are registered as blind or partially sighted. We do not have absolute figures of the proportion of blind and partially sighted who live in isolated communities across the UK but an analysis of the Guide Dogs user data we hold for Scotland indicates that 4.5% of blind and partially sighted people in Scotland live in the isolated communities of Highlands, Western Isles, Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands.&#xa0;1.3 Public transport is extremely important to the independent mobility of blind and partially sighted people as the nature of their disability means they are unable to drive. Research has revealed that although disabled people travel less often than non-disabled people, they are more likely to use bus services.&#xa0;

[[[To what extent are the needs of different ]]]

[[[groups of passengers (e.g. people with disabilities, older people, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?]]]The needs of blind and partially sighted passengers are not sufficiently taken into account by local authorities or transport providers in isolated communities. The following areas cause significant problems for blind and partially sighted people:&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[2.1 Limited Availability ]]]

[[[of Services]]]Limited services in isolated areas can make the difference between people with sight loss going out and integrating with their community or remaining isolated and immobile in their homes. Guide Dogs has received indications from service users that public transport provision in rural areas is declining, with serious consequences for people’s independence: 

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.1.1 “There isn’t a bus into Brecon anymore; it costs over £20 to get a taxi, so we have to rely on our family for lifts to go shopping. My wife is deaf blind and has depression, it’s very hard for us now as my sight is failing and we want to carry on doing things for ourselves, we’ve raised a family together here in Llangorse, we’ve always lived in the village, but they say the little shop is closing now so I don’t know what we’ll do” Mr R, Llangorse &#xa0;2.1.2 “There aren't enough buses locally. I only have the choice of one bus to get me to work and that only runs term time. Next year this service will stop, meaning I am totally reliant on others.” Guide Dog Owner, Dorset&#xa0;2.1.3 “I stopped driving in 2001 due to severe sight loss.  At that time, the Post Bus came through Scethrog and other rural communities … It meant that I was able to retain a level of independence ….  It was always popular and well used.  About 2007 the service was withdrawn.  I now rely on my husband, and taxis… I really miss the Post Bus which was reliable, did not require booking and was efficient. " Mrs S, Scethrog&#xa0;

[[[Unmanned]]]

[[[ Train]]]

[[[ Stations]]]1 Unstaffed stations, of which there are 220 in Wales, 33 in Northern Ireland and 209 in Scotland, present particular difficulties. Unmanned stations in rural areas cause problems for blind and partially sighted people in purchasing tickets, getting the information and support they need from station staff, and embarking and disembarking safely from trains&#xa0;2.2.1 Stepping from the platform to the train and vice versa is potentially dangerous as the gap between train and platform varies both horizontally and vertically. Provision of appropriate color-contrasted tactile warning strips at platform edges is inconsistent and often absent. A blind or partially sighted person may not be able to use an unstaffed station unless they are absolutely certain of their route from the train to the platform and from the platform to the station exit.&#xa0;2.2.2 New designs of automated ticket vending machines require use of a touch screen which gives no tactile or audible feedback. Partially sighted people report problems with the size and tonal contrast of text on the screens and glare caused by reflective light sources. Whilst journeys can be pre-booked online, it is still necessary to use a credit card and enter a pin number on the ticket machine to retrieve tickets. This is impossible for blind people to do without help from staff. &#xa0;2.2.3 Passenger Assistance is generally useful for disabled travelers. However, Guide Dogs has received anecdotal evidence from our service users that the faxes used to alert station staff to the need for passenger assistants are sometimes sent to unmanned stations where they are not picked up until after the requested time of departure. This results in passengers disembarking, expecting to be met by staff, but finding themselves alone in an unmanned station.&#xa0;

[[[Access]]]

[[[ to embarkation points]]]The ability of people to use public transport depends on them being able to access the embarkation and disembarkation points. The Department for Transport has recognised this, stating “we need to focus on improving the entire door-to-door journey.” Options for public transport in isolated communities are more limited than in most metropolitan areas, leaving blind and partially sighted people fewer places to access public transport or interchange between modes of transport. &#xa0;2.3.1 Safe access to bus stops and stations can be adversely affected by cars parked inappropriately, poor lighting, poor infrastructure design, poor maintenance of hedges and verges, isolated stops, and a lack of safe places to cross roads. The ability to walk to and from stops and stations depends also upon pavement quality. Kerbed footways clearly delineate between pedestrian and traffic areas, indicate a safe place to walk, and denote the positioning of bus stops and shelters. Some country roads do not have formal kerbed footways, making it difficult for blind and partially sighted people to reach public transport embarkation points.&#xa0;2.3.2 "Pengam railway station in Glan-yr-Nant has a busy crossroads with no pedestrian crossing over the main Bargoed to Ystrad Mynach road or the road leading to Fleur-de-Lys.” Rehabilitation Officer, Wales.&#xa0;2.3.3 “[the bus service is] just not suitable for people with sight loss living in rural areas. Need taxis to and from bus depots/stops.” Guide Dog Owner, Northern Ireland.&#xa0;2.3.4 “There is one bus an hour into Chepstow, but the road I have to walk to get to the bus stop has no pavements. At one point there are high walls on both sides and the Lorries that go by frighten me. My guide dog and I have to push ourselves back against the wall if we get caught there, I really dread it” Mrs G, Guide Dog Owner, Caerwent. &#xa0;

[[[Information]]]

[[[ availability]]]

[[[ ]]]Timetable and service information should be available to passengers in their preferred format. A lack of accessible, accurate and timely information is a major deterrent to blind and partially sighted people using public transport in isolated communities. Audio and visual announcements on buses and bus stops are essential to disabled people in helping them to understand their location and proximity to their destination. &#xa0;2.4.1 “I live in a rural community, none of my busses have audio announcements, which makes it difficult for me to sometimes travel alone feeling entirely comfortable and free of anxiety, particularly during quieter times of the day, and especially when not knowing if the bus stop is a "request" only stop.” Guide dog owner, Kent&#xa0;2.4.2 “Recently when going home … I missed my stop and had to go to the end of the route and come back. This would not have happened if audio visual announcements were on the bus. It would be great to see some movement on getting some audio visual on some routes” Guide dog owner, Northern Ireland&#xa0;

[[[2.5]]]

[[[ Staff ]]]

[[[training]]]Where information is not freely available, staff can be a key point of information during journeys and at stops. This means that, particularly in rural areas, drivers’ attitudes and role in providing effective and timely information and support is critical. &#xa0;2.5.1 Drivers need to be given disability awareness training to ensure they are aware of the needs of disabled passengers by, for example, pulling up next to the kerb or providing assistance. Guide Dogs Road to Nowhere Report found that only 25% of blind and partially sighted people reported that bus drivers always pulled up to the kerb. Only 55% reported that drivers always say the number of the bus when asked, and as few as 17% reported that drivers always wait for blind or partially sighted passengers to find a seat before pulling off. &#xa0;2.5.2 “Some of the bus drivers drive so fast and then have to jam on the brakes hard when they see someone is waiting, on the rural journey from Cirencester to Cheltenham and back.  It makes me feel sick and my guide dog slides along the floor towards the front of the bus if I don't grab her.” Guide Dog Owner, South West England&#xa0;2.5.3 “I rely heavily on rural transport to get to the bus stop in my local town which causes me more problems. In my local town there is no bus station, so the buses pull up on the street and could be double parked or 2 ft away from the kerb. I can't tell which bus is the one I want and need to rely on other passengers… I don't have confidence in travelling by bus at night or in the dark evenings.” Guide Dog Owner, Northern Ireland&#xa0;2.5.4 Guide Dogs recommends that the Department for Transport reassess its decision to postpone the implementation of the disability awareness training for drivers required by EU Regulation 181/2011. The Regulation’s implementation would ensure that drivers in isolated areas properly take the needs of blind and partially sighted passengers into account. &#xa0;

[[[transport services?]]]Blind and partially sighted people can rely on taxis to bridge the gap in public transport provision and avoid dangerous situations. This is particularly relevant in isolated areas where public transport services are more limited or harder to access. Visually impaired people may have to use taxis in place of public transport at significant additional cost to them, especially as many qualify for free or heavily discounted public transport. The Road to Nowhere report showed that 67% of blind and partially sighted respondents spent money on taxi fares because they didn’t trust their local bus services. &#xa0;3.1 “Unfamiliar areas cause great difficulties for me and I don't know where to get off the bus, so tend to rely on taxi travel, rather than take the bus.” Guide Dog Owner, Northern Ireland&#xa0;3.2 However, frequent taxi use is expensive. 14% of Road to Nowhere respondents spent between £30 and £50 on taxis a month and 10% spent more than £50 a month. Additionally, demand-responsive transport services may not always be readily available in isolated areas.&#xa0;3.3 “Taxis are not an option as the local operators cover the school runs so none available to get me to work. My DLA is under threat so I will not be able to afford to pay for a taxi anyway.” Guide Dog Owner, Dorset&#xa0;3.4 “There is a Dial a Ride service but I am very conscious that a 16-seater minibus travelling from Brecon to pick me up is neither cost effective nor environmentally friendly.  It also has to be booked a few days in advance and therefore does not cope with spontaneous trips.”  Mrs S, Scethrog&#xa0;3.5 The law (Equality Act 2010 in England, Scotland and Wales and the Disability Discrimination Act in Northern Ireland) states that the driver of a licensed taxi or private hire vehicle cannot refuse to carry a guide dog, or other registered assistance dog, unless the driver has a medical exemption. However, Guide Dogs receives regular reports of cases where guide dog owners have been refused access by taxi drivers. Due to the nature of their disability, blind and partially sighted people may not be able to get the license plate number of the taxi or driver registration and so many such incidents go unreported, or local authorities fail to take action because of a lack of evidence. Whilst guide dog owners continue to be refused access to taxis, it is unreasonable to expect them to rely upon taxis as a means of transport in isolated communities because of the commercial imperative in decision making relating to public transport.&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0; Royal National Institute for Blind People research: http://www.rnib.org.uk/aboutus/research/statistics/Pages/statistics.aspx#H2Heading2  Attitudes of Disabled People to Public Transport; DPTAC, pp 28, 2002 Department for Transport, Door to Door Strategy, March 2013 Guide Dogs Road to Nowhere Report: https://d3qkb2hv043xyy.cloudfront.net/fileadmin/gdmain/user/Help_us/Campaigns_and_petitions/Documents/Road_to_Nowhere_Report_22.04.2013.pdf   Regulation 181/2011: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:055:0001:0012:EN:PDF  Guide Dogs, Road to Nowhere Report: https://d3qkb2hv043xyy.cloudfront.net/fileadmin/gdmain/user/Help_us/Campaigns_and_petitions/Documents/Road_to_Nowhere_Report_22.04.2013.pdf   Ibid
