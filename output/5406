[normal]Written evidence submitted by [bold]the British Heart Foundation [bold](BTO[bold] [bold]03[bold]5[bold])[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The British Heart Foundation (BHF) is the nation’s leading heart charity. We are working to achieve our mission of a world in which no-one dies prematurely of heart disease in the UK. We fund ground-breaking medical research, provide support and care to people living with heart disease and advocate for change. We rely on donations from the public to fund our life saving work. 
[normal]Although we are currently funding medical research that 
[normal]may
[normal] 
[normal]one day render the need for heart transplants obsolete, until then a heart transplant is the only effective treatmen
[normal]t available for people with end-
[normal]stage heart failure. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The BHF warmly welcome
[normal]s
[normal] the opportunity to respond to this Inquiry. We are currently calling for the introduction of a soft opt-out system of organ donation
[normal]. We believe that this will help address
[normal] the 
[normal]UK’s 
[normal]organ donor shortage
[normal] and better reflect the public wishes. We
[normal] know that 
[normal]nine
[normal] out of 
[normal]ten
[normal] people support organ donation yet only 
[normal]three
[normal] out of 
[normal]ten
[normal] 
[normal]go on to sign the Organ Donor Register (ODR)
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Changing 
[normal]the way we register conse
[normal]nt can help close this gap and consequently
[normal] make more organs available for transplantation. 
[normal]However
[normal] this is not a magic bullet. The i
[normal]ntroduction of 
[normal]a 
[normal]soft opt-out 
[normal]system 
[normal]must be accompanied by 
[normal]both investment in infrastructure and resources and a public awareness campaign. 
[normal]All three 
[normal]elements 
[normal]need to be undertaken 
[normal]together 
[normal]to
[normal] 
[normal]first; 
[normal]secure more organs and 
[normal]second; 
[normal]accommodate additional organs and 
[normal]a subsequent rise in transplant operations.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We welcome the
[normal] strength of
[normal] four ambitious targets set within the strategy, particularly the 
[normal]target of
[normal] increasing familial consent rates
[normal] from 
[normal]57 per cent
[normal] to in excess of 80 per cent. 
[normal]We
[normal] are
[normal] also pleased to see that the strategy 
[normal]states that
[normal] having the conversation with your loved 
[normal]ones 
[normal]is
[normal] vital to improving donor and consent rates. The BHF also 
[normal]call
[normal]s
[normal] for more people to
[normal] make their wishes known to their loved ones, as this will help make a difficult decision at a difficult time easier for families
[normal],
[normal] regardless of whether an opt-in or soft opt-out system is in place. We welcome NHS Blood and Transplant
[normal]’
[normal]s (NHSBT) plans to run a
[normal]n ambitious
[normal] public awareness campaign
[normal] focused on 
[normal]changing the behaviour of the nation towards organ donation. 
[normal]By encouraging 
[normal]the 
[normal]conversation it’s hoped that the 
[normal]perceived 
[normal]taboo around discussing organ donation will be broken down and that organ donation will become a normal part of life both inside and out of hospital. Again, we 
[normal]are
[normal] pleased to see that the strategy 
[normal]also acknowledges 
[normal]that a review of the end of life pathway is needed 
[normal]to ensure that all opportunities to secure a donor are maximised in a sensitive and timely way. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Similarly, another strength is the focus on the differing cultural barriers to donation that arise within Black and Minority Ethnic communities (
[normal]B
[normal]ME
[normal]).
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]BME communities make up 7.8
[normal] per cent
[normal] of the UK population
[normal] but only make up 2
[normal] per cent
[normal] 
[normal]of the organ donor register.
[normal]  W
[normal]e know that those from Black and 
[normal]South Asian communities are three times more likely to need an organ transplant.
[normal] Research shows that common barriers
[normal] 
[normal]to donation 
[normal]within BME 
[normal]communities 
[normal]include
[normal]; religious beliefs, anxieties, traditions, myths and lack of information.
[normal] 
[normal]Therefore the strategy’s
[normal] focus on tackling these barriers in a specialised way is much needed and to be welcomed. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Finally, 
[normal]the 
[normal]BHF also support
[normal]s
[normal] the review of the IT systems used across the donor network.  Anything that makes the process of donor and recipient matching faster and more effective is to be welcomed. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, the one significant weakness of the strategy is that is does not include or 
[normal]discuss
[normal] the introduction of a soft opt-out system of organ donation. Instead the strategy is very
[normal] cautious about discussing 
[normal]opt-out
[normal] and instead notes that NHSBT will 
[normal]maintain a watching brief on what happens with the introduction of legislation in Wales. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, we believe a system change is much needed. Under the current system 
[normal]466 people died last
[normal] year because they did not receive
[normal] an organ in time, 
[normal]with 
[normal]a further 766 removed from the list as their condition had deteriorated past the point of possible transplantation.
[normal] T
[normal]he demand for heart transplants has risen 
[normal]by 89 per cent
[normal] since 2004
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]International data shows that an opt-out system is associated with higher donation rates and several studies suggest that it would increase the numbers of organs available for transplantation by up to 30
[normal] per cent
[normal] 
[normal]in the UK.
[normal] Expanding this model and projection to the UK would see a potential increase of between 25
[normal]0
[normal] and 31
[normal]5
[normal] donors in the UK as a whole.
[normal] Taking into consideration that one donor can 
[normal]transform up
[normal] to nine 
[normal]lives
[normal],
[normal] the potential 
[normal]number of 
[normal]lives saved
[normal] or improved
[normal] would be 
[normal]significant
[normal].
[normal] Also
[normal],
[normal] previous 
[normal]cost
[normal]-
[normal]benefit
[normal] 
[normal]analys
[normal]i
[normal]s 
[normal]of the introduction of a soft 
[normal]opt-out system shows it to be a cost
[normal]-
[normal]effective treatment.
[normal] This takes into account the reduction 
[normal]in 
[normal]medical management of conditions for those waiting for organs 
[normal]and the significant psychological gains for patients that no longer have to receive on-going medical management and have 
[normal]of the chance of
[normal] longer term survival.
[normal],
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The change in system would also prompt a step change in the way that the public talk about organ donation. We have already highlighted how important it is that people have the conversation with their families and loved 
[normal]ones to make their wishes known. H
[normal]owever we hope that completely overhauling the 
[normal]system
[normal] would prompt that conversation to take place on a wider scale. Publicity campaigns have run before across the UK, and yet we still do not have enough donors on the ODR. 
[normal]Therefore changing the way
[normal] that we register consent should be a catalyst for this conversation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As noted this change must be accompanied by investme
[normal]nt in infras
[normal]tructure, In 
[normal]the 
[normal]BHF’s 2013 report 
[normal]‘Making opt-out a reality in Wales’
[normal] we identified a number of areas for development that are key in maximising a soft opt-out system
[normal]:
[normal] staff training; increasing the numbers of transplant co-ordinators and specialist organ donation nurses; removing financial barriers to 
[normal]hospitals
[normal] and effective management of donors through a national agency for 
[normal]transplantation.
[normal] 
[normal]This would ensure that there is a system fit for practice to accommodate extra organs and transplant operations, as well as maximising the opportunity to  secure more donors in a timely and sensitive way. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In addition
[normal],
[normal] it
[normal] is 
[normal]very welcome
[normal] 
[normal]that 
[normal]NHSBT
[normal] will be engaging the public in future ideas
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]However,
[normal] the BHF strongly 
[normal]opposes
[normal] 
[normal]the suggestion
[normal] 
[normal]that 
[normal]those who are on the ODR 
[normal]would 
[normal]get priority treatment if they need a transplant
[normal], as suggested in the strategy as a possible 
[normal]option
[normal]. The BHF strongly believe
[normal]s
[normal] that donor organs should b
[normal]e 
[normal]distributed
[normal] 
[normal]on clinical need alone.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Although we must always express caution when making direct comparisons between countries which have d
[normal]ifferent cultures and variables 
[normal]there is a great deal of evidence from countries such as 
[normal]Croatia, 
[normal]Norway
[normal] and Belgium 
[normal]that show 
[normal]increases in donation rates following 
[normal] a move to an opt-out 
[normal]system
[normal] together with
[normal] investment in infrastructure and raising public awareness
[normal] of organ donation.
[normal] 
[normal]For example in Norway
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]where an
[normal] opt-out system has operated since 1973
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]there 
[normal]has
[normal] 
[normal]been
[normal] significant investment in 
[normal]the
[normal] infrastructure – with Europe’s largest single transplant centre based in Oslo and five transplant co-ordinators to aid retrieval across the country. Norway’s rate of donation in 2011 was 24.5 
[normal]per million population (
[normal]pmp
[normal])
[normal],
[normal] which was well above the European average.
[normal] 
[normal]In Belgium the rate of organ donation increased from 19 to 41 
[normal]pmp
[normal] three years after the introduction of opt-out legislation. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Croatian model provides a clear example that a move to opt-out alone would not provide the much needed organ increase. 
[normal]In 2000,
[normal] 
[normal]Croatia
[normal] 
[normal]had one of the lowest donor rates 
[normal]pmp
[normal] in Europe at just 2.7 
[normal]pmp
[normal] despite moving to an opt
[normal]-
[normal]out system 12 years previously. Yet after a period of significant 
[normal]investment
[normal] by 2011 Croatia had one of the highest rates of donation in Europe of 33.6 
[normal]pmp
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] To achieve this, there was heavy investment in 
[normal]developing
[normal] an ‘in-house’ 
[normal]transplant co-ordinator network in all hospitals which improved donor detection and management of potential donors. This approach also helped to reduce family refusal rate to 
[normal]20 per cent, which is less than half of the UK’s current refusal rate.
[normal] A 24 hour helpline was set up at the Ministry of Health to support transplant co-ordinators 
[normal]deliver
[normal] 
[normal]a speedy and efficient donor-transplant process. 
[normal]Furthermore there has 
[normal]been significant investment in public awareness campaigns organ
[normal]ised by the Ministry of Health 
[normal]and non-governmental organisations such as the Croatian Donor Network. There has also been continuous education and organ donor card promotion.
