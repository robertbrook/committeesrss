default&#xa0;
defaultThe British Heart Foundation (BHF) is the nation’s leading heart charity. We are working to achieve our mission of a world in which no-one dies prematurely of heart disease in the UK. We fund ground-breaking medical research, provide support and care to people living with heart disease and advocate for change. We rely on donations from the public to fund our life saving work. 
defaultAlthough we are currently funding medical research that 
defaultmay
default 
defaultone day render the need for heart transplants obsolete, until then a heart transplant is the only effective treatmen
defaultt available for people with end-
defaultstage heart failure. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe BHF warmly welcome
defaults
default the opportunity to respond to this Inquiry. We are currently calling for the introduction of a soft opt-out system of organ donation
default. We believe that this will help address
default the 
defaultUK’s 
defaultorgan donor shortage
default and better reflect the public wishes. We
default know that 
defaultnine
default out of 
defaultten
default people support organ donation yet only 
defaultthree
default out of 
defaultten
default 
defaultgo on to sign the Organ Donor Register (ODR)
default.
default 
defaultChanging 
defaultthe way we register conse
defaultnt can help close this gap and consequently
default make more organs available for transplantation. 
defaultHowever
default this is not a magic bullet. The i
defaultntroduction of 
defaulta 
defaultsoft opt-out 
defaultsystem 
defaultmust be accompanied by 
defaultboth investment in infrastructure and resources and a public awareness campaign. 
defaultAll three 
defaultelements 
defaultneed to be undertaken 
defaulttogether 
defaultto
default 
defaultfirst; 
defaultsecure more organs and 
defaultsecond; 
defaultaccommodate additional organs and 
defaulta subsequent rise in transplant operations.
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWe welcome the
default strength of
default four ambitious targets set within the strategy, particularly the 
defaulttarget of
default increasing familial consent rates
default from 
default57 per cent
default to in excess of 80 per cent. 
defaultWe
default are
default also pleased to see that the strategy 
defaultstates that
default having the conversation with your loved 
defaultones 
defaultis
default vital to improving donor and consent rates. The BHF also 
defaultcall
defaults
default for more people to
default make their wishes known to their loved ones, as this will help make a difficult decision at a difficult time easier for families
default,
default regardless of whether an opt-in or soft opt-out system is in place. We welcome NHS Blood and Transplant
default’
defaults (NHSBT) plans to run a
defaultn ambitious
default public awareness campaign
default focused on 
defaultchanging the behaviour of the nation towards organ donation. 
defaultBy encouraging 
defaultthe 
defaultconversation it’s hoped that the 
defaultperceived 
defaulttaboo around discussing organ donation will be broken down and that organ donation will become a normal part of life both inside and out of hospital. Again, we 
defaultare
default pleased to see that the strategy 
defaultalso acknowledges 
defaultthat a review of the end of life pathway is needed 
defaultto ensure that all opportunities to secure a donor are maximised in a sensitive and timely way. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSimilarly, another strength is the focus on the differing cultural barriers to donation that arise within Black and Minority Ethnic communities (
defaultB
defaultME
default).
default 
default 
defaultBME communities make up 7.8
default per cent
default of the UK population
default but only make up 2
default per cent
default 
defaultof the organ donor register.
default  W
defaulte know that those from Black and 
defaultSouth Asian communities are three times more likely to need an organ transplant.
default Research shows that common barriers
default 
defaultto donation 
defaultwithin BME 
defaultcommunities 
defaultinclude
default; religious beliefs, anxieties, traditions, myths and lack of information.
default 
defaultTherefore the strategy’s
default focus on tackling these barriers in a specialised way is much needed and to be welcomed. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFinally, 
defaultthe 
defaultBHF also support
defaults
default the review of the IT systems used across the donor network.  Anything that makes the process of donor and recipient matching faster and more effective is to be welcomed. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, the one significant weakness of the strategy is that is does not include or 
defaultdiscuss
default the introduction of a soft opt-out system of organ donation. Instead the strategy is very
default cautious about discussing 
defaultopt-out
default and instead notes that NHSBT will 
defaultmaintain a watching brief on what happens with the introduction of legislation in Wales. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, we believe a system change is much needed. Under the current system 
default466 people died last
default year because they did not receive
default an organ in time, 
defaultwith 
defaulta further 766 removed from the list as their condition had deteriorated past the point of possible transplantation.
default T
defaulthe demand for heart transplants has risen 
defaultby 89 per cent
default since 2004
default.
default 
defaultInternational data shows that an opt-out system is associated with higher donation rates and several studies suggest that it would increase the numbers of organs available for transplantation by up to 30
default per cent
default 
defaultin the UK.
default Expanding this model and projection to the UK would see a potential increase of between 25
default0
default and 31
default5
default donors in the UK as a whole.
default Taking into consideration that one donor can 
defaulttransform up
default to nine 
defaultlives
default,
default the potential 
defaultnumber of 
defaultlives saved
default or improved
default would be 
defaultsignificant
default.
default Also
default,
default previous 
defaultcost
default-
defaultbenefit
default 
defaultanalys
defaulti
defaults 
defaultof the introduction of a soft 
defaultopt-out system shows it to be a cost
default-
defaulteffective treatment.
default This takes into account the reduction 
defaultin 
defaultmedical management of conditions for those waiting for organs 
defaultand the significant psychological gains for patients that no longer have to receive on-going medical management and have 
defaultof the chance of
default longer term survival.
default,
default&#xa0;
defaultThe change in system would also prompt a step change in the way that the public talk about organ donation. We have already highlighted how important it is that people have the conversation with their families and loved 
defaultones to make their wishes known. H
defaultowever we hope that completely overhauling the 
defaultsystem
default would prompt that conversation to take place on a wider scale. Publicity campaigns have run before across the UK, and yet we still do not have enough donors on the ODR. 
defaultTherefore changing the way
default that we register consent should be a catalyst for this conversation.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs noted this change must be accompanied by investme
defaultnt in infras
defaulttructure, In 
defaultthe 
defaultBHF’s 2013 report 
default‘Making opt-out a reality in Wales’
default we identified a number of areas for development that are key in maximising a soft opt-out system
default:
default staff training; increasing the numbers of transplant co-ordinators and specialist organ donation nurses; removing financial barriers to 
defaulthospitals
default and effective management of donors through a national agency for 
defaulttransplantation.
default 
defaultThis would ensure that there is a system fit for practice to accommodate extra organs and transplant operations, as well as maximising the opportunity to  secure more donors in a timely and sensitive way. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition
default,
default it
default is 
defaultvery welcome
default 
defaultthat 
defaultNHSBT
default will be engaging the public in future ideas
default.
default 
defaultHowever,
default the BHF strongly 
defaultopposes
default 
defaultthe suggestion
default 
defaultthat 
defaultthose who are on the ODR 
defaultwould 
defaultget priority treatment if they need a transplant
default, as suggested in the strategy as a possible 
defaultoption
default. The BHF strongly believe
defaults
default that donor organs should b
defaulte 
defaultdistributed
default 
defaulton clinical need alone.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAlthough we must always express caution when making direct comparisons between countries which have d
defaultifferent cultures and variables 
defaultthere is a great deal of evidence from countries such as 
defaultCroatia, 
defaultNorway
default and Belgium 
defaultthat show 
defaultincreases in donation rates following 
default a move to an opt-out 
defaultsystem
default together with
default investment in infrastructure and raising public awareness
default of organ donation.
default 
defaultFor example in Norway
default,
default 
defaultwhere an
default opt-out system has operated since 1973
default,
default 
defaultthere 
defaulthas
default 
defaultbeen
default significant investment in 
defaultthe
default infrastructure – with Europe’s largest single transplant centre based in Oslo and five transplant co-ordinators to aid retrieval across the country. Norway’s rate of donation in 2011 was 24.5 
defaultper million population (
defaultpmp
default)
default,
default which was well above the European average.
default 
defaultIn Belgium the rate of organ donation increased from 19 to 41 
defaultpmp
default three years after the introduction of opt-out legislation. 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Croatian model provides a clear example that a move to opt-out alone would not provide the much needed organ increase. 
defaultIn 2000,
default 
defaultCroatia
default 
defaulthad one of the lowest donor rates 
defaultpmp
default in Europe at just 2.7 
defaultpmp
default despite moving to an opt
default-
defaultout system 12 years previously. Yet after a period of significant 
defaultinvestment
default by 2011 Croatia had one of the highest rates of donation in Europe of 33.6 
defaultpmp
default.
default 
default To achieve this, there was heavy investment in 
defaultdeveloping
default an ‘in-house’ 
defaulttransplant co-ordinator network in all hospitals which improved donor detection and management of potential donors. This approach also helped to reduce family refusal rate to 
default20 per cent, which is less than half of the UK’s current refusal rate.
default A 24 hour helpline was set up at the Ministry of Health to support transplant co-ordinators 
defaultdeliver
default 
defaulta speedy and efficient donor-transplant process. 
defaultFurthermore there has 
defaultbeen significant investment in public awareness campaigns organ
defaultised by the Ministry of Health 
defaultand non-governmental organisations such as the Croatian Donor Network. There has also been continuous education and organ donor card promotion.
