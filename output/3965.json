"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Dr Ben Goldacre, Sir Iain Chalmers, Dr Trish Groves, Dr Fiona Godlee, Dr Virginia Barbour (GMC0019)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nBen \nGoldacre\n is a medic \nand \nacademic who writes \nfor the \npublic on misuses of scientific evidence\n, including a recent book \nabout \nproblems in medicine [1]\n. \nIain Chalmers is co-founder of the Cochrane Collaboration, and director of the James Lind Library. Trish Groves is \na medic and \nDeputy Editor of the British Me\ndical Journal. \nFiona \nGodlee\n is \na medic and \nEditor in Chief of the British Medical Journal. Virgin\ni\na Barbour is \na medic and \nEditor in Chief of \nPLoS\n \nMedicine\n. \nAll are \nalso\n co-founder\ns\n of \nAllTrials\n, a campaign \nwith widespread public and professional support \nc\nalling for all trial results on currently used treatments to be made publicly available\n [\n2\n]\n. \n&#xa0;\nWe are \nwriting to raise three areas where the assistance of the GMC would be very valuable to patients and the public\n, and where such intervention is timely\n.\n&#xa0;\n1. Promoting participation in research. \nThe GMC guidance previously stated that doctors “\nmust work with colleagues and patients . . . to help resolve uncertainties about the effects of treatments” (\npara\n 14f)\n. \nHowever, in \n2013 \nthe GMC \nremoved \nthis clause\n [3]\n. \nT\nhis decision should be reversed, and the clause reinstated\n. Research is the only way we can identify and reduce uncertainty about which treatments work best. At present there is considerable red tape obstructing doctors who seek to conduct research\n. M\nuc\nh of \nthis red tape \nis unnecessary; the incentives to participate in research do not reflect the urgency of the \nneed for better evidence to guide clinical practice\n. \nT\nhere are many documented cases where patients have suffered and died unnecessarily\n,\n because\n doctors \nhave \nfailed to \nrecognise\n uncertainty\n and conduct research to address it\n [3]\n. The GMC requires doctors to practice medicine based on research evidence. \nWe cannot \ndo so \nwithout \nproducing \nthis \nevidence, and doctors have a responsibility to \nall \npatien\nts to help identify and reduce uncertainty in everyday clinical practice.\n This should be \nunambiguously \nreflected in GMC guidance\n, as it was until 2013\n.\n&#xa0;\n2. A register for doctors’ conflicts of interestThere is a need for a register of doctors' \nc\nonflicts o\nf \ni\nnterest, similar that for MP's. At present, doctors may receive \nconsultancy \nincome, \nresearch \nfunding, sponsorship, travel, hospitality and free educational activity sponsored by the pharmaceutical and device industries\n; m\nany doctors serving on Clinical \nCommissioning Groups now run companies whose services are commissioned by their own CCG\n; m\nany media doctors receive income from PR or medical companies\n; and so on\n. \n&#xa0;\nC\nonflicts of interest cannot be prevented, nor would it be desirable to do so: there is mu\nch good work done by doctors collaborating with industry. \nThese payments \nalso \ndo not mean that doctors are corrupt. However, t\nhere is extensive research evidence showing that \ndoctors with financial \nconflicts of interest \noften \nexpress \nmore \nfavourable\n \nviews on \nthe \ntreatments\n in question\n,\n when compared to \ndoctors who have not received such payments\n. \nI\nt is \ntherefore \nimportant that information about these conflicts of interest is transparent\n. It\n is currently extremely hard - and in many cases impossible - \nfor patients, colleagues, \npatients \nand the public to establish who \nhas paid\n a doctor.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIndustry and self-\nregulatory approaches to this have failed, and will most likely to continue to do so. The Ethical Standards in Health and Life Sciences Group (co-chai\nred by the ABPI and the Royal College of Physicians) is a particularly concerning example: they produced \"guidelines\" documents for doctors which contained a number of false claims, and gave false reassurance on important matters of patient safety, before \ndisbanding\n in October 2013\n, \nwithout ever giving \na clear account of their activities\n [4] [5] [6]\n. Furthermore, declarations of payments to doctors from the pharmaceutical industry \n(which has often been proposed, but never delivered) \nwould be\n \ninsufficient, a\ns \nthis sector \ncover\ns\n only a small proportion of the many sources of \npayments to \ndoctors\n, as\n described above\n. \n&#xa0;\nThe GMC requires doctors to re-register each year, \nand \nmaintains a public register\n. It is therefore \nin \na clear position to \nrequest \na simple decla\nration \nof financial conflicts of interest \nfrom each doctor in the UK\n, \nannually, \nand make \nthis information \npublicly available\n on the register\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3. Action on withheld trial resultsThe problem of clinical trial results being \nwitheld\n, on treatments in curren\nt use, continues to undermine the evidence base for medicine. The best currently available evidence suggests that around half of all trials have their results withheld\n [7]\n. Doctors, patients, researchers and payers cannot make informed decisions about whic\nh treatments are best\n,\n when half \nof all \ntrial results are \nunavailable\n. This problem has not been adequately addressed by medical \nand\n academic professional bodies, regulators, or industry. \nThere has also been a worrying trend for some in both industry and \nmedicine to give false reassurance, claiming that the problem has been fixed. This poses a significant threat to patient care.\n&#xa0;\nThe Science and Technology Select Committee called on the government to take action \nover \nthis issue\n in September 2013\n [8]\n. \nThe H\nealth Committee called on the GMC \nto take action on this issue in January \n2013 \n[\n9\n]. \nThe \nBritish Medical Association\n passed a motion \nin June 2013 \n[10] [11] \n[12] \nstating that:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“(\ni\n) Selective non-publication of unflattering trial data is research misconduct\n; \n“\n(ii) Registered medical practitioners who give grounds to believe they have been involved in such conduct should have their fitness to practice assessed by the GMC\n.” \n&#xa0;\nIt would therefore be useful if the \nGMC could \nprominently \nclarify their position\n, \nand strengthen the wording of their guidance\n, requiring that \nany \ndoctor\n \nworking on \na \ntrial\n \nboth past and present - on all treatments currently in use – \nis \nresponsible for ensuring that the trial is \nregistered\n,\n with \nits \nresults made publicly available\n withi\nn a year of completion\n; and forbidden from entering into contracts with trial sponsors that \nrelinquish access to data \nand prevent dissemination of results\n. \n&#xa0;\nWhile only a small proportion of doctors actively participate in conducting \nrandomised\n trials, a m\nuch larger number \nmake a valuable\n positive\n contribution by \nrecruit\ning and encouraging \npatients to participate \nin others’ \ntrials research.\n They too have a responsibility around missing trial results.\n \nPara 49d of Good Medical Practice says that doctors must work in partnership with patients, providing \n“\nany other information patients need if they are asked to agree to be involved in teaching or \nresearch\n”\n. This would be greatly\n&#xa0;\nstrengthened by adding a ne\nw clause\n&#xa0;\n49e \n“\nDoctors should advise patients to\n&#xa0;\nparticipate in a clinical trial only if: (1) the study protocol has been registered and made publicly available; (2) the protocol refers to systematic reviews of existing evidence showing that the trial is ju\nstified; and (3) each patient\n&#xa0;\nreceives a written assurance that the full study results will be published and sent to all participants who indicate th\nat they wish to receive them.\n”\n [\n13\n] [\n14\n]\n&#xa0;\nThe GMC \ndo good work on misdeeds \nby individuals \nin individual stu\ndies\n. However\n, \nit is \ninadequate and inconsistent to \nonly \nhold individual studies to hig\nh\n standards, \nwhen \nthe biases we are seeking to exclude \ncan re-emerge\n \nfurther down the chain\n. \nEven when all trials are conducted perfectly, i\nf \nthose \nwhole studies \nwith un\nflattering results \nare withheld from the public record\n – as we know they commonly are -\n then we are \noverall \nmisled on the risks and benefits of treatments\n,\n \nas surely as if the data \nfrom \nthe individual studies themselves were fraudulent\n.\n The GMC are in a po\nsition to police the withholding of trial results\n,\n as they \npolice \nother forms of research misconduct.\n It is in patients’ interests that they should do so.\n&#xa0;\nReferences. &#xa0;\n[1] “Bad \nPharma\n: how medicine is broken, and how we can fix it” Ben \nGoldacre\n, 4\nth\n Estate, 2013\n[2] www.alltrials.net\n[3] \nRoberts I, \nChaudhry\n B, Chalmers I.
