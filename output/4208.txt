[[[Supplementary written evidence from Network Rail (SLC 047)]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Network Rail welcomes the report of the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission, which was published after the deadline for written evidence to the Transport Select Committee inquiry into level crossings. Given the law in this area is crucial to our operation and changes are rarely proposed we would like to comment on the proposed changes. &#xa0;

[[[Improvements]]]&#xa0;Network Rail strongly welcomes the review of the law around level crossings, in particular where greater clarity allows a clearer delineation of responsibilities and assists in closing crossings. Having level crossings governed entirely under the Health and Safety at Work Act (1974) is logical and clarifies the law considerably.&#xa0;In particular we welcome the reportâ€™s call for greater co-operation between rail and road authorities, something for which we have called for some time. Clarity around the process of closing a crossing is helpful.&#xa0;The call for a review of offences is also welcome. Given the severe potential consequences of dangerous or reckless driving at level crossings, Network Rail has for a long time called for more severe penalties (paragraph 7.141). &#xa0;

[[[Concerns]]]&#xa0;We have some specific concerns about the report, largely concerning the relationship between safety and convenience. The proposed requirement that ministers consider convenience of users when exercising their powers could be seen as establishing a trade-off between safety and convenience (paragraph 7.10). &#xa0;More worrying is the recommendation (paragraph 7.20) that ministers can impose requirements necessary to ensure convenience of crossing users as well as their safety. While we would not expect this power to be used extensively it is a source of concern. &#xa0;The closure process seems to have an extensive list of people whose objections could trigger an appeal. Given our experience of objections to our proposals to close crossings on safety grounds it seems likely that any proposed closure would be highly likely to trigger a hearing under this process (paragraph 7.57). We therefore doubt that this approach would speed up the process of closing a crossing, even where there were clear safety grounds for doing so. This is of serious concern to us given our commitment to pursue the closure of high risk crossings.&#xa0;The proposal to give Scottish ministers the power to order the creation of a new crossing is of particular concern and goes entirely against our work to close crossings as the best way to improve safety (paragraphs 7.135-7.137). &#xa0;&#xa0;
