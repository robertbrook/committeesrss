defaultImprovementsdefault&#xa0;
defaultNetwork Rail strongly welcomes the 
defaultreview
default of the law around level crossings, in particular where greater clarity allows a clearer delineation of responsibilities and assists in closing crossings. 
defaultHaving level crossings governed entirely under the Health and Safety at Work Act (1974) is logical and clarifies the law considerably.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn particular we welcome the reportâ€™s call for greater co-operation between rail and road authorities, something for which we have called for some time.

default&#xa0;
defaultThe call for a review of offences is 
defaultalso 
defaultwelcome. Given the severe potential consequences of dangerous or reckless driving at level crossings, Network Rail has for a long time called for more severe penalties (paragraph 7.141). 
default&#xa0;
defaultConcernsdefault&#xa0;
defaultWe have some specific concerns about the report, largely concerning the relationship between safety and convenience. 
defaultThe proposed requirement that ministers consider convenience of users when exercising their powers could be seen as establishing a trade-off between safety and convenience (paragraph 7.10). 
default&#xa0;
defaultMore worrying
default 
defaultis the recommendation (paragraph 7.20) that ministers can impose requirements necessary to ensure convenience of crossing users
default as well as their safety
default. While we would not expect this power to be used extensively 
defaultit is a source of concern. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe closure process seems to have an extensive list of people whose objections could trigger an appeal. Given our experience of objections to
default our proposals to close
default crossings on safety grounds it seems likely that any proposed closure would be 
defaulthighly 
defaultlikely to trigger a hearing

default (paragraph 7.57)
default.
default 
defaultWe 
defaulttherefore 
defaultdoubt that this approach would speed up the process of closing a crossing, even 
defaultwhere there were clear
default safety grounds
default for doing so
default.
default This is of serious concern to us given our commitment to pursue the closure of high risk crossings.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe proposal to give Scottish ministers the power to order the creation of a new crossing is of particular concern and goes entirely against our work to close crossings as the best way to improve safety
default (paragraphs 7.135-7.137).
