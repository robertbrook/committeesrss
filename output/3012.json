"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the Department from Environment Food and Rural Affairs&#xa0;\nThis memorandum provides the Committee with background information relating to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the Government’s approach to implementation\n in England\n. \n&#xa0;\n1.\n              \nExecutive summary\n2.\n              \nIntroduction\n3.\n              \nNegotiations on the new EU CAP \n4.\n              \nApproach to implementation\n5.\n              \nStakeholder engagement and consultation\n6.\n              \nProgress with developing the CAP IT system \n7.\n              \nPillar 1 - Market measures\n8.\n              \nPillar 1 – Direct Payments Scheme\n9.\n              \nPillar 2 - Rural Development Programme\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1\n              \nDefra led for the UK on the EU negotiations on the new CAP, working \nclosely \nwith all Devolved Administrations. As EU negotiations draw to a conclusion, Defra is increasing the emphasis on how the new CAP is implemented in England. The \nD\nevolved Administrations are similarly looking at how they will implement the new CAP.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nDefra is responsible\n for negotiations at UK level,\n for the development of implementing policies and regulations in England and for the development of \nthe supporting delivery mechanisms including the necessary IT systems, administrative and inspection functions.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n              \nT\nhe outcome of negotiations did not \nmove the CAP anything like as far as the UK wanted in the direction of reform. From a UK perspective, \nt\nhe CAP should be about helping the EU agriculture sector to become more competitive and market-oriented whilst providing environmental public goods that the market does not reward.\n \nNevertheless, \nDefra is aiming to implement the deal in \na \nway which \nis\n as simple, affordable and effective as possible. \n&#xa0;\n2.4\n              \nIn August we published two Status Reports, one on the new Rural Development Programme in England\n and one on Direct Payments\n. The former presented an update on developments with some factual background on Rural Development Programme (RDP), whilst the latter we provided a summary of what has been agreed about the new direct payments system and set out our approach to implementation in England. \n&#xa0;\n2.5\n              \nDefra wants to see a competitive farming industry that faces less red tape, takes advantage of export opportunities and is less reliant on public subsidy.  Over the next seven years the UK \nis expected to \nreceive \nabout \n£17.8 billion under Pillar 1 on direct subsidies and £1.84 billion under Pillar 2 on the environment and rural development (subject to confirmation\n, both figures are 2011 prices\n). Where Defra has greater discretion on how CAP money is spent, we need to make sure it is spent efficiently, in the right places and where it adds greatest public value. Whatever decisions are taken on the implementation of the CAP, and specifically in relation to the potential transfer of money from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2, the majority of CAP payments will still be to farmers through \nthe \nPillar 1 \nDirect P\nayment\n Scheme\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.6\n              \nThe next CAP can make a significant contribution through \nrural development funding \nto improving the environment, \ninvesting in farming competitiveness and growing the wider rural economy in England. \n&#xa0;\n3.1\n              \nWhile \nDefra\n felt the Commission had identified the right challenges in its Communication of 2010 – the need to increase agricultural productivity to meet growing world demand for food and at the same time reduce environmental impact – we were disappointed at the lack of ambition the Commission showed in the package of CAP proposals published on 12 October 2011. The UK did not see how the initial proposals would address the objectives the Commission had identified.\n&#xa0;3.2\n              \nThis was the first CAP Reform to be co-decided with the European Parliament (EP), following the entry into force of the Treaty on the Functioning of the E\nuropean \nU\nnion\n (Lisbon Treaty). \n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nAfter months of detailed negotiations, the Council of Ministers, European Parliament (EP) and European Commission agreed a new CAP deal in principle in June 2013.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.4\n              \nAt the time of the June deal, MEPs had insisted that agreement was still outstanding on elements of the CAP package linked to the EU Budget agreement in February 2013.  These outstanding issues were discussed and resolved with minimal changes to the CAP package in September 2013. The EP is now expected to vote on the CAP package in mid-November followed by final approval from the Council of Ministers in December 2013. \n&#xa0;\n3.5\n              \nCAP implementing legislation will follow from the European Commission; to be agreed by in the first half of 2014.  This legislation will provide the detail to the main CAP regulations agreed this year. The full CAP package will take effect from 2015\n \nwith the \nsCMO\n coming fully into effect before then in 2014.  A transitional regulation for 2014 is being agreed in parallel with the main CAP regulations and will also be subject to final approval in December 2013.\n&#xa0;\n3.6\n              \nThe UK negotiated hard to secure a final outcome on the CAP regulations that overall was a significant improvement on the Commission’s original proposals. However, it is still very disappointing and does not move CAP anything like as far as we’d have wanted in the direction of reform.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1\n              \nMany scheme rules are set out in the EU regulations and we have no choice other than to follow them.  However there are aspects where we have options on how we implement elements of CAP. Where there is scope to do so, \nDefra \nis aiming \nto implement the new CAP in England\n in ways which are simple, affordable and effective\n. Simplicity for \nthose \nappl\nying \nfor CAP funding as well as for our delivery bodies administering the systems will not only be more efficient but will also \nhelp reduce\n the risk of disallowance. \nDefra’s\n approach to implementing the revised CAP is intended to meet wider government better regulation commitments and to minimise as much as possible the potential burdens on CAP customers.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n              \nDefra is determined to \nlearn from and \navoid \nrepeating \nthe mistakes of 2005, when policy choices were made that did not work well on the ground. This caused unnecessary uncertainty and delayed payments to a significant number of farmers and ultimately cost the taxpayer dearly \nin EU fines. \n&#xa0;\n4.3\n              \nWe have reviewed \nthe recommendations from the multiple reports that looked in detail at the 2005 implementation to make sure we understand what went wrong then and to ensure it does not happen again. We have identified\n six \nthemes that run through the problems in 2005 that we continuously monitor\n. \nThese are:\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnsuring policy is deliverable\n on the ground\n and \nstriving for early certainty where it is possible to \nminimis\ne\n the effect of policy uncertainty;\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnsure shared understanding of requirements \nand new policies \nfrom the outset\n between policy makers and delivery bodies\n;\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMaintaining c\nontinuity of key people \nand expertise\n;\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIntroduce clearer accountabilities and responsibilities between Defra, RPA and \nother \ndelivery partners; \ne)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBetter use of programme risk management to ensure all risks and issues can be monitored, managed and correctly reported on; and,\nf)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nE\nnsure that lines of communication between Defra, agencies and Stakeholders are clear.\n&#xa0;\n4.4\n              \nKey stages in the coming months include the following, which may be subject to change:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.5\n              \nBeyond January 2015, we will be looking ahead to the next round of CAP negotiations; in particular, what can be done to help ensure a better set of Commission proposals for the next CAP regulations that will take effect after 2020.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1\n              \nWe \nare\n commit\nted\n to the principles of co-design and early \ninvolvement\n by working with the interested parties on the best ways to implement the various elements of CAP. \nConsulting widely and engaging openly with the farming industry and other interested groups will \nhelp \nensure we make the right decisions\n for customers and the public purse\n. \nThis will also help us ensure we don’t repeat the mistakes of 2005. \nWe have sought to listen to the widest \nvariety of views on CAP Reform during EU negotiations and ha\nve\n maintained this approach as we prepare for implementation in England. \n&#xa0;\n5.2\n              \nOur approach addresses \nrecommendations from the Farm Regulation Task Force.\n For example, we have been working closely with the farming organisations, our delivery bodies and other interested parties on the development of proposals on the implementation of the Direct Payment Schemes and the new environmental land management schemes.\n&#xa0;\n5.3\n              \nThe openness of our approach does not mean everyone with an interest in the new \nCAP will agree on everything. There will undoubtedly be strong and divergent views, as there were during the negotiations. There will be difficult decisions. Some elements of the new CAP will increase complexity and it is important that we minimise these where we can.  \n&#xa0;\n5.4\n              \nThe Secretary of State, other Ministers, and officials have engaged directly and frequently with the farming industry and other interested groups. Defra has held several events in recent months, attended by Ministers, to hear first-hand from a broad range of \ninterested groups on their thoughts about CAP implementation\n. These events have been informative and have helped to shape the formal public consultation\n. For example, \nMinisters took account of views \nexpressed \nin deciding to consult on as much of the CAP package as possible at this stage, and in framing the consultation questions. \n&#xa0;\n5.5\n              \nCAP touches a wide range of agricultural, rural, environmental and other interests. Defra and its delivery bodies are working closely together to ensure a coherent and consistent approach to engaging with this wide range of interested groups and individuals, drawing on the expertise and understanding shared between the organisations. At a practical level, the relevant teams meet monthly to plan activity. \n&#xa0;\n5.6\n              \nWe will consult formally on the implementation of CAP shortly. Our intention is to make the consultation as comprehensive as possible to help interested parties to reach an informed view on interrelated issues. In some cases the Government already has a clear view on the way forward, or has already had to make decisions due to the long lead \ntime for implementing aspects of the schemes or the need for farmers to have certainty. In these cases the consultation document will set out what we have decided. In other areas we will be seeking views in order to make the best informed choices.\n&#xa0;\n5.7\n              \nThere are some constraints that affect the timetable for consultation. We need to notify the Commission formally by 31 December 2013 on whether and to what extent we wish to transfer funds from the CAP budget for direct payments (Pillar 1) to fund rural development (Pillar 2), which is part of this consultation. \n&#xa0;\n5.8\n              \nThere are some detailed issues on which it would not be sensible to reach a view until we have more information from the European Commission about \nthe application of the rules. We plan to engage closely with stakeholders on these issues as the details from the EU processes emerge.\n&#xa0;\n5.9\n              \nThe consultation is part of a much broader approach to engagement with interested parties.\n&#xa0;\n5.10\n              \nWith the consultation we propose to publish an analysis of the main impacts of the new CAP. This will include evidence on\n the impact \nof the decisions to be taken\n, but \nalso considers \nthe value for money for tax payers, and the costs to consumers of \nCAP as a whole\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.1\n              \nDefra is aiming to improve customer service and value for money \nand reduce disallowance risk \nthrough developing a new single online CAP application and payment system\n, ready for scheme year 2015\n.\n \nWhile the CAP negotiations have been \nunderway\n \nthe CAP Delivery programme \nhas\n been able to co\nntinue development of the \nsystem as \nit is being built\n it in a flexible way that will allow us to integrate any changes \nin implementation \nas they occur\n.  \n&#xa0;\n6.2\n              \nThe programme has been consulting with interest groups from to understand user needs and inform the development of a system \nwhich is \neasy to use and intuitive\n. Fortnightly\n user research is carried out with farmers, land managers, agents and future applicants, who provide feedback on iterations of the system as part of continuous improvement to the design and functionality.  The programme is also more broadly engaging stakeholders, individually and via established consultative groups, customers and staff to get ready for the shift to both this new system and new schemes.\n&#xa0;\n6.3\n              \nIn line with the government’s digital agenda, the new CAP service is designed to be “digital by \ndesign\n”. The programme recognises in the \nearly days of the new service, customers will require support to cope with a lot of change and some may have a \n‘\ngenuine need’ to assisted digital entry. The programme is listening to stakeholders’ concerns about the digital by \ndesign\n approach given shortfalls in rural broadband coverage and \nis \nworking with them and the Government Digital Service to \nencourage\n digital uptake and \nto \nformulate options \nfor those who genuinely can’t access the new system\n;\n these may include a role for \ntelephone \nchannels and utilising delivery body advisers\n. The \nSecretary of State will take the \nfinal decision on which option\ns are available.\n \n&#xa0;\n6.4\n              \nThe programme has\n reduce\nd\n \ndelivery risks\n and\n the\n costs of development\n by integrating existing \ntried and tested CAP software where available \nwith \nbespoke \ndevelopment where needed\n. \nThis includes the procurement of \na system which is used across three European countries and manages 2 million farmers’ \nCAP \npayments. This \nsystem will\n meet some of \nthe development\n needs, is compliant with the \nrequirements of the \ncurrent CAP \nregulations \nand has not resulted in any disallowance costs. \nThe \ncontract \nfor the \nScheme \nAccounting and Payment function has been awarded to Hitachi.\n&#xa0;\n6.5\n              \nThe first piece of completed development is a\n Rural Land Registry (RLR)\n map v\niewer\n, due to be released to RPA customers in November.  This is aimed to encourage\n customers \nto \nmake the transition to online systems\n.  The build is now focusing on development of the CAP services screens and the process for customer registration which will be ready for release in summer 2014. Other \nworkstreams\n are delivering the migration of customer data, business transition and integration with existing systems that will be required.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7.1\n              \nThe Single Common Market Organisation (\nsCMO\n) regulation lays down rules for the common organisation of agricultural markets. Market measures set out in the \ns\nCMO\n regulation include the tools used to provide a safety net at times of market crisis inside the EU\n,\n trade and competition rules, quota systems, specific marketing standards that apply to certain sectors and/or products, individual aid schemes and the promotion of producer organisations \n(POs) \nand inter-branch organisations\n (IBOs) that operate more widely than POs by working along the supply chain\n. \nThe safety net includes \nintervention, export refunds, private storage aid and the provision of a new crisis reserve\n. T\nhe quota systems in the sugar and wine sectors will now be in place for extended periods\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n7.2\n              \nIn most cases, the new \nsCMO\n regulation updates existing provisions rather than representing a radical reform, however several of the changes that have been made\n rollback previous CAP reforms and went against the Lisbon Treaty in transferring additional powers to the EP. At Agriculture Council in June\n 2013\n the UK and Germany could not support the \ns\nCMO\n regulation due to the amendments that had been made in order to reach a compromise with the European Parliament. The UK and Germany therefore abstained in the \nsCMO\n vote to enable agreement on the overall CAP package.\n&#xa0;7.3\n              \nThe revised \nsCMO\n regulation will:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7.4\n              \nThe \nsCMO\n regulation is directly applicable in the UK. However, there are 2 key provisions in the regulation where Member States can decide what approach they wish to take\n:\n whether to extend formal recognition of PO\ns\n to all sectors, and whether or not to make it compulsory for farmers to have written contracts with processors or distributors. At this stage the Government is yet to be convinced that choosing to implement either of these options would add significant value, as other forms of co-operation are already available to producers that do not necessitate them meeting requirements set by Europe, and the vast majority of domestic farmers already have a written contract with the processing company or distributor that buys their produce. \n&#xa0;\n7.5\n              \nThe \nsCMO\n regulation will come into force from January 1, 2014. \n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n8.1\n              \nThe current Single Payments Scheme (SPS) will be replaced under CAP reform from 2015 with a new system of Direct Payments.  \n&#xa0;\n8.2\n              \nThe\n Status Report on Direct Payments\n, referred to above,\n describes in detail what has been agreed in the EU, although we still await the final text of the European Direct Payments regulation which is likely to be agreed only in November.\n \nMany of the main parameters of the scheme will be defined in that regulation and in the \nCommission\n implementing regulations which will be agreed in Brussels over the coming months. This \nsection \ntherefore gives only an overview of the Direct Payments system, and reference may be made to the Status Report for further information.\n&#xa0;\n8.3\n              \nWe expect \nthe Autumn\n 2013 \nconsultation on CAP reform to include \nour proposals for implementation of \nDirect Payments\n, insofar as the European Direct Payments regulation affords discretion to Member States. The consultation paper\n \nwill (among other things) invite views on a series of strategic Direct Payments implementation issues, including:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n8.4\n              \nMany features of the S\ningle Payment Scheme (S\nPS\n)\n will continue, but there are significant changes too.  \nFarmers will continue to qualify to receive an annual payment if they meet the conditions defined in the E\nU\n regulations. As under SPS, the key conditions will be that the farmer holds entitleme\nnts and has eligible land at their\n disposal for the relevant scheme year. In the case of \ntenanted land in England, it will be the tenant who has the land at his disposal and therefore qualifies for the direct payment. \n&#xa0;\n8.5\n              \nThe amount of the payment will depend on the number, and value, of entitlements supported by eligible land. \nFarmers will not have to grow crops or keep livestock to be eligible for payment but \nwill continue to have to meet the rules on cross compliance\n, which will be subject to some amendments\n. In addition, farmers will have to meet a new ‘active farmer test’, and 30% of the payment will depend on implementing greening measures (covered in the next section). There will be a system under which large payments are subject to a reduction. There is also a new scheme for young farmers. \n&#xa0;\n8.6\n              \nThe consultation will not cover the question of whether entitlements should be carried forward from the current scheme or reissued at the start of the new scheme, as stakeholder organisations have stressed to us importance of giving farmers a decision as soon as possible to help with business planning. We therefore plan to announce a decision on this as soon as possible\n.\n&#xa0;\n8.7\n              \nThere are a number of other issues where it would not be sensible to decide how we should implement the scheme in England until we have clarity about the detailed rules which will be defined in the implementing regulations. The Commission will be publishing their proposals for these rules in stages over the coming weeks, and we expect the implementing regulations to be agreed by Easter 2014. We will be discussing the detailed aspects of scheme design with stakeholder organisations in the first half of 2014.\n&#xa0;\n8.8\n              \nThese issues include a number of detailed aspects of scheme design albeit ones which will be important to the farmers concerned. They include:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n8.9\n              \nIn addition to the forma\nl consultation in Autumn\n, we will continue to discuss Direct Payments implementation issues with key stakeholders in the Direct Payments Consultative Group, which meets at approximat\nely monthly intervals\n.\n8.10\n              \nAs Figure 1 shows, UK farmers may receive less per hectare than some other EU Member States but they receive more per farmer than most. However, th\nere are many factors which affect competitiveness in agriculture within the \nEU and the impact of differing levels of direct payments in Pillar 1 between Member States has limited effect. The factors which have a greater impact on competitiveness include \nnatural resources, wage leve\nls, tax and regulatory policies, and investment in \ninnovation and training.\n  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Figure 1: Average direct payments per beneficiary and per hectare in each member state&#xa0;\n(Source: European Commission)\n&#xa0;\n8.11\n              \nThe new CAP includes a \nprovision that 30% of a farmer’s\n Direct Payment should be conditional on them meeting certain criteria intended to be beneficial to the wider environment. This is referred to as “greening”. Ministers have decided that the broad approach to greening in England should be to adhere to the \nagricultural practices \nset out in the \nDirect\n Payments Regulation and \nis\n announced as part of the consultation package\n.\n&#xa0;\n8.12\n              \nThere has been an appetite from stakeholders for early clarity on the approach to greening. Arable farmers need the information as early as possible so that they can begin to make crop plans for the 2015 calendar year. Stakeholder organisations wished for clarity to help put into context their views on such issues as the level of financial transfer between pillars of the CAP and the approach that should be taken to successor \nagri\n-environment schemes.\n&#xa0;\n8.13\n              \nTwo b\nroad approaches to greening are\n realistically\n \npossible\n:\n the one where we adhere to the \nspecified agricultural practices\n, or an\nother\n based on the \noption \nto implement greening through a \nN\national Certification Scheme that includes additional measures\n that are equivalent \nto the \nspecified agricultural practices\n. \nMinisters are minded not to choose \nthe second approach because, although it has the potential to bring enhanced environmental benefit, \nwe\n could only do this at increased cost and increased risk\n. \nThere would be increased costs to farmers who chose the equivalent measures, increased implementation costs and delivery risk to delivery agencies and increased risk of disallowance as we moved away from the basic model which we expect to be implemented elsewhere in \nthe EU. Set against this we consider\n that the additional environmental benefits might be small in the context of a Certification Scheme in which farmers were able to choose simpler and cheaper alternatives and so where uptake of the more beneficial options might be low.\n&#xa0;\n8.14\n              \nT\nhis approach is consistent with the Government’s view that it is Pillar II of the CAP, not Pillar I initiatives such as greening, which provid\nes the optimum mechanism to deliver\n the majority of environmental outcomes from English farmland.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n9.1\n              \nThe Status Report on the New Rural Development Programme in England (RDP) referred to above, set out our understanding of many aspects of the RDP at that time. \nThe new RDP provides a major opportunity to invest in the rural economy and environment. \nOur plan is for t\nhe new programme \nto\n begin formally on 1 January 2015. The Government’s objectives for the next programme in England are to:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n9.2\n              \nThe new programme will be governed by a new EU Rural Development Regulation\n, which forms part of the new CAP package being agreed. \n&#xa0;\n9.3\n              \nThe Regulation outlines six broad ‘priorities’ for the EU for rural development. Member States must aim to meet at least four of the priorities in the design \nof\n their programmes. These priorities are broken down into a number of ‘focus areas’ under which Member States are required to identify activity for funding through their programmes. The six priorities are:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n9.4\n              \nThe RDP must include at least 30% of EU funding on measures to protect and enhance the environment and at least 5% through the local delivery mechanism known as the LEADER approach.\n&#xa0;\n9.5\n              \nDefra will manage the next RDP.  A proportion of RDP funds in England will be channelled through an EU growth programme along with the EU structural funds, with Local Enterprise Partnerships determining how that funding is used.  This element of RDP funding will be used specifically in rural areas for b\nuilding knowledge and skills;\n f\nunding new and developing micro, small and medium sized business; \nf\nunding small scale renewable and broadband Investments; and \ns\nupport for tourism activities\n.       \n&#xa0;\n9.6\n              \nWe believe that \nr\nural development offers the best use of taxpayers’ money under the \nCAP\n. It provides crucial funding that helps\n \nimprove the environment\n,\n improve farmers’ competitiveness\n and\n grow the rural economy. \nWe are already committed to spend over £2bn in the next RDP on multi-annual \nagri\n-environment and forestry agreements signed up under the current programme.\n&#xa0;\n9.7\n              \nThe Government \nbelieves \nthat \nrewarding farmers for the environmental goods they provide is a much better use of taxpayers’ money than providing direct income support\n.  \nTransferring funding to rural development would also increase \nthe \nability to deliver improvements in the productivity and longer term competitiveness of UK agriculture and to help grow the rural economy in England\n. \nWe \ntherefore \nwelcome the flexibility to transfer up to 15% of funds from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2. This is one of the key issues that we will be formally consulting on.\n  It is one of the factors that will determine the available budget in England, along with the allocation of CAP funds between England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.  \n&#xa0;\n9.8\n              \nWhatever the final budget\n for the next RDP\n we expect farmers and land-based industries will continue to receive by far the majority share of funding.\n&#xa0;\n9.9\n              \nWe want to improve value for money from RDP and to look for opportunities to achieve multiple objectives. We will be looking for views on how to focus the available budget.  More specifically we will be seeking views on:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n9.10\n              \nMuch of the \nnew \nprogramme will \ntherefore \nbe invested in environmental schemes that deliver multiple benefits and will be supported by investment in help to farmers to be more competitive and less reliant on subsidies and investment in long term. \n&#xa0;\n9.11\n              \nWe \nplan to \nsubmit our proposals for the RDP to the Commission in \nthe first quarter of 2014\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/230280/pb14018-cap-reform-rdpe-status-report-20130819.pdf\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/230284/pb14016-cap-reform-direct-payments-20130819.pdf\n Cross-Compliance is a set of rules that farmers claiming Direct Payments will have to comply with, as those claiming SPS currently do. Cross-Compliance comprises the need to comply with Statutory Management Requirements (SMRs) and to keep land in Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC). Some changes to Cross-Compliance will result from the new CAP.\n"
