[normal]The Space Action 
[normal]Nework
[normal] (SPAN) comprises university group and institute heads across the fields of Earth Observation, Space Engineering and Space Science. Our joint response to the above consultation is as follows:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The ESA 
[normal]programme
[normal] is generally very successful with excellent underpinning technological development. It is implemented in such a way as to provide continuity and commitment.  Following a thorough assessment and selection process space missions generally 
[normal]go on to provide a world class in-space capability
[normal]. This continuity is in contrast to that of NASA where political interference and changes of high level policy cause much disruption
[normal], delay and cost increase
[normal]. Moreover, the selection process involves significant community participation and balances science value with technical/programmatic risk and opportunity.
[normal] A weakness of this assessment and selectio
[normal]n process is that it is slow and 
[normal]elaborate with much nugatory work taking place at the expense of the nations.
[normal]1.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The mechanism of 
[normal]Juste
[normal] retour, in which individual nations receive a large return of their subscription in terms of industrial contracts has been generally effective. While it can sometime lead to an element of compromise,
[normal] or lack of optimization,
[normal] it ensures continued support from participating nations. 
[normal]The increasing size of ESA places additional pressures on the 
[normal]Juste
[normal] retour mechanism.
[normal]1.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]ESA is technically highly competent and so makes an intelligent customer for the prime contractors and is able to make informed decisions regarding strategic technological developments.
[normal] However, ESA’s 
[normal]programme
[normal] is small compared with the overall European space 
[normal]programme
[normal] which gives prime contractors a great deal of power. As a result ESA often defers to the primes position at the expense of nationally funded instrument providers to avoid contract cost increases.
[normal]1.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]ESA’s policy to cover all technical aspects associated with space has led to the creation of its ‘
[normal]Centres’
[normal] (ESOC, ESRIN, ESTEC, ESAC, 
[normal]‘Harwell’,
[normal]…). While these are effective they provide services to space missions in a non-competitive environment and so are perceived to be expensive and elaborate. 
[normal]2.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It will be important to align ESA’s space 
[normal]programme
[normal] with that of the EU, especially in terms of technology and capability development (rather than 
[normal]major 
[normal]space missions
[normal] which should remain the province of ESA
[normal]). It would be very detrimental in further politicize ESA and 
[normal]so 
[normal]to introduce to it many of NASA’s weaknesses. However, better cooperation in terms of technological development would avoid duplication 
[normal]and funding gaps.
[normal] Non-EU nations (Switzerland and Norway in particular) play an important role in ESA and might be excluded were there to be common governance.  
[normal]3.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The EU has probably much more to learn from ESA in terms of the implementation of a European space 
[normal]programme
[normal] than ESA has to learn from the EU.
[normal]3.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]ESA has the best perspective on the needs of the space sector. An independently EU strategy makes little sense – see 2 above. Nevertheless, the EU does provide useful support in this area
[normal] especially with the more focused ERC schemes. However, EU funding is to
[normal] bureaucratically managed.  
[normal]4.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]UKSA’s awareness of the particular needs and constraints of the space sector in general and ESA in particular are evident in a more nimble and informed decision making process (e.g. compared with STFC). It only weakly supports early technological development (i.e. non-mission specific) which is currently the responsibility of other research councils (STFC, EPSRC and NERC).   It’s relationship with these bodies will need to evolve so that a more joined-up approach can be established. 
[normal]It should be noted that because of EPSRC’s reluctance to fund space engineering, UK universities are forced to turn to ESA and the EU for support
[normal] in this area
[normal].
[normal]4.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]So far UKSA has been a success.  
[normal]5.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The UK science community benefits very significantly from the ESA space 
[normal]programme
[normal].
[normal] It’s missions have made a great contribution to our understanding of processes that shape our Earth and the Universe. European space technology is world class. 
[normal]6.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Space debris and solar activity represent a real threat to the UK’s space-based infrastructure. While the probability of a major incident is low, its potential impact is very high and could be very expensive. The UK should have a clear strategy for reduction and mitigation of these risks and should engage with ESA, the EU and others to maximize the benefits of its 
[normal]national 
[normal]contribution in this area.
