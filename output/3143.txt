[[[Supplementary written evidence from the Consumer Council]]]&#xa0;The Consumer Council gave oral evidence to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee on 11 September 2013 on how the Northern Ireland (NI) retail banking market affects NI consumers. We were asked for further information on a range of subjects as follows:&#xa0;

[[[atistics on access to daily banking services- NI consumers]]]The Family Resources Survey (FRS) collects information on the incomes and circumstances of private households in Northern Ireland. It has been running in Great Britain since October 1992, but 2002/03 saw the introduction of Northern Ireland for the first time. The latest report was published in February 2013 and summarises the results for the 2010/11 survey in which 1,896 households were interviewed. All adults questioned in the Family Resources Survey were asked about the types of accounts they have held over the last 12 months. &#xa0;Information on the numbers of people/households with access to bank accounts is an important indicator for financial inclusion. The Consumer Council’s ‘Price of Being Poor’ report shows that consumers on low incomes that cannot access mainstream financial services end up paying more, a “poverty premium”, for the services they need (for example, higher gas and electricity bills because they cannot get direct debit discounts). &#xa0;Table 4.1 on the following page shows the percentage of households with one or more current, savings or investment accounts and those with one or more direct payment accounts, including and excluding Post Office Card Accounts (POCAs).  This has been measured across all areas of GB and NI. &#xa0;A POCA allows consumers to withdraw cash at the Post Office but there are no facilities to set up direct debits to manage money and pay bills.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Table 4.1 shows that 13 per cent of households in NI do not have a current account with access to direct debit and overdraft facilities.&#xa0;It also shows that only 95 per cent of households in NI had any type of account including POCAs. This was the lowest proportion for any region in the UK, with the exception of East Midlands (which was equal to NI), and compared to a UK average of 98 per cent. 

[[[Age profile of consumers without a current account]]]&#xa0;We were asked to provide further data on the age profile of consumers who do not have a current account and the proportion of consumers who do not have an alternative such as a Post Office Card Account.To do this, we had to request further data from the Family Resources Survey which is specific to Northern Ireland adults (individuals) only. 18 per cent of NI adults (individuals) did not have a current account at the time of the survey in 2010/11. Please see the age profiles of those consumers below:&#xa0;Age groupNumber (000's)Percent16-24                                   167 1325-34                                   242 1835-44                                   250 1945-54                                   240 1855-59                                     97 760-64                                     90 765-74                                   143 1175-84                                     84 685+212&#xa0;

[[[Building Societies in ]]]

[[[NI]]]The main building societies with branch facilities in NI are Nationwide and the Progressive. Nationwide offer a range of current account services. They have 14 main branches. As mentioned at the committee meeting on 11 September, there have been closures of agency services provided by Nationwide in the past. Nationwide previously had nine agencies (private insurance brokers and estate agents) operating in NI that carried a small float to service customers with current accounts. All of these agencies closed in 2008. Consumers must now visit one of the 14 branches for face to face service.
