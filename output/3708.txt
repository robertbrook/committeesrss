&#xa0;Written evidence from Linda Farley (CYS0007)Today I had two very encouraging encounters with lorries a couple of minutes apart.  These incidents illustrate that well equipped lorries with well trained and considerate drivers can make a real difference to cycle safety.&#xa0;1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; I was holding back on the inside of a lorry in a stream of traffic on the Archway Road.  The driver saw me, and I saw him, in his nearside mirror.  He waved to indicate that he had seen me and that I could proceed to pass him on the inside, which I did.  In this case the mirrors were larger and better positioned than most on commercial vehicles.2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; At the bottom of Archway I was waiting to join the traffic going round the roundabout.  The driver of a Waitrose lorry saw me, paused his vehicle which created space for me to join the traffic on the roundabout and waved to me to show he was waiting for me.  I joined the traffic on the roundabout easily and safely.Key to both incidents was the driver’s positive awareness of me as a cyclist and their readiness to communicate with me.
