defaultAs chair of the 
default‘
defaultGet Your Boots On
default’
default Ramblers group and a keen proponent of public transport, I am dismayed
default t
defaulto find that we are being faced with seriously damaging cuts to bus services in our area next year. We run a series of linear walks, and always try to fit these around public transport options.
default 
defaultThis year, we have been walking the Abbey Trail, from Kirkstall (Leeds) to Whitby over a series of 10 stages, and for 7 of those we have been able to get from one end of the walk to the other by public transport
default—
defaultthis simplifies the logistics significantly and means that even if people are driving to the walk, they can car-share efficiently
default 
default     
defaultBut North Yorkshire County Council have stated that next year, funding for the Moorsbus network will be stopped completely. This Moorsbus has provided leisure services across the North York Moors for over 30 years. In recent years, the network has been salami-sliced, bit by bit. In 2004, all routes ran on Sundays and bank holidays from Easter to October and some weekdays during t
defaulthe school summer holidays; the ‘
defaultcore
default’
default routes ran daily May
default–November
default. That has gradually whittled away; it now only runs on Sundays, no weekday or Saturday service at all. And for most of these areas, the Moorsbus is the only bus service.
default     For the local communities, these buses are essential. Throughout the summer, they bring hundreds of visitors to the region, many of whom are walkers. The loss of these buses will be hugely damaging to tourism in this wonderful part of the country, and will reduce the potential for walkers to enjoy environmentally friendly transport to and from their walks.
default     The Moorsbus, and the Dalesbus
default—
defaultits counterpart in the Yorkshire Dales
default—
defaultare great examples of how to make leisure transport in rural areas work very well. The networks are designed around key hubs where different routes connect with each other. Because connections are guaranteed, and timings are well worked out, a much more comprehensive network can be designed efficiently and passengers are happy to change buses, so direct services between each point are not needed. Multi-operator all-day tickets make them affordable and easy to use. 
default      It is disappointing that the networks often only run on summer Sundays, limiting the potential for walking and tourism at other times of the year. Where there are services through the week, they typically don
default’
defaultt run as a coordinated network
default—
defaultthere aren
default’
defaultt well planned connections between routes, there aren
default’
defaultt multi-operator tickets, and information about the buses is typically hit-and-miss. Buses during the week are generally timed around getting residents from villages into the nearest towns, rather than getting people out to the villages, and this often makes them unsuitable for walkers.
default     But perhaps the biggest problem, as I mentioned further up, is that free travel is making these networks unaffordable. Even where, as Dalesbus has managed, outside subsidy has been secured to cover the operational costs, the cost to councils of English National Concessionary Travel Schemes usage is crippling local authority budgets. This is the elephant in the room that needs to be 
defaultaddressed if rural leisure buses are to have a sustainable future. [Ramblers member, East Yorkshire

default[In July 2013] I returned from a week
default’
defaults holiday in Northumberland. To do so, I had to catch the 
defaultonly
default bus of the day from Knowesgate at 09.55 via Ponteland to Newcastle (service 131 from Jedburgh along the A68). The bus was 20 minutes late at Knowesgate, and not in the best of condition (the contract had been given to a new operator recently). One elderly passenger getting off at Ponteland to do her shopping was very concerned she might not be able to get home again if the return service later in the day did not run. I don
default’
defaultt know if she did get home, but the incident brought home to me that these infrequent rural services 
defaultneed to
default be operated by reliable vehicles and on time. [Ramblers member, Surrey

defaultI live in Kirk Ireton [Derbyshire], a hill village at the southern end of the Pennines. The population is 500. There is a village shop (restricted hours), a primary school, 
defaulttwo 
defaultchurches, a village hall and one pub. Few are employed in the village; workers commute to Derby (13 miles), Matlock (8 miles), Belper (8 miles), or Ashbourne (7 miles). The 1:5 gradient of the village
default’
defaults approach road makes it unsuitable for commuting by 
defaultbi
defaultcycle.
default 
default But of buses suitable to allow employment outside village there is only one a day to both Ashbourne and Matlock.  The return times make commuting difficult. There are no direct links to other towns. There are no weekend buses, though this is prime walking country. Elderly, those unable to drive (medical, sight, age reasons) and teenagers (for social or employment reasons) are severely restricted by lack of bus transport and its scheduling.  [Ramblers member, Derbyshire

default]
defaultPublic transport managers are focused on education trips, trips to work and perhaps trips into a local centre where facilities exist
default—
defaultall else falls way down the agenda. Yet, the shopping and leisure market is the only growth market there is; buses feeding into town centres from rural areas help with the local economy. There is little joined up thinking 
defaultre

default&#xa0;
defaultAs we said above, this has been no empirical study. But all the experience is that provision for public transport is in most places grossly inadequate; that it would benefit country-dwellers and town-dwellers alike if there were reliable public transport; and that frequency, imaginativeness, reliability and readily-accessible up-to-date and accurate information about services are the key to persuading people to use public transport in favour of cars. It would also complement the experience of rural walking by getting cars off the roads and by providing recreational walkers with a ‘real’ destination as opposed to the place they began, i.e, where they left their car. And it would encourage more people to walk and reap its health-benefits, including some members of the 25% 
defaultof carless households, thus reducing the nation’s health-bill and boosting the rural economy.  
defaultThe case for frequent, reliable, imaginative and accessible and affordable rural passenger transport is clear.

defaultSir, I wonder how many people are aware of the isolation threatening an increasing number of rural communities, due to the ending of public transport services because they are said to be uneconomic. I take, as an example, the village of Pilton, near Shepton Mallet, in Somerset, where I live.... This area has been deprived of an excellent rail service. On November 28 1970, this village and many others will be deprived of their daily bus service by the decision of the Western National Omnibus Company to end it. No alternative is offered. It may be true that the service is not a profit-making one, but 
defaultis there not a social obligation to provide some public transport for people who are not car owners or drivers and to whom such a service is essential

defaultSir, ... We used to have a railway, and a modest bus service feeding it from the villages around, But Beeching pointed out the undeniable fact our railway was uneconomical, so it was closed. Three years later the bus company announced that, without a railway to feed, their services had also become uneconomic, so they stopped running them.... The fact is that since the Beeching closures the whole economy of rural transport has changed and the car has perforce become an integral part of rural life.... Our nearest railway station is [now] 24 miles away; to visit a relative in the nearest large hospital entails a round trip of 84 miles (or 48 miles plus the rail trip if one can spare a whole day away from work for it

defaults rural bus grant via North Yorkshire County Council. High quality buses were used, which offered comfort and easy access for the elderly and disabled. The buses ran seven days a week from early morning to late at night, the timetable was integrated with nearby rail services and the routes were carefully designed by local people. A voluntary supporters

default group ensured that bus stops displayed current timetables. The four-month trial was a success
default. After a slow start, passenger 
defaultnumbers rose and, by the end, were rising at 1 per cent per week compared with three per cent 
defaultper annum
default for 
defaultbus travel nationally. The service was particularly popular with young people who, for the first time, could independently visit their friends and sample urban night life. Unfortunately the county council stopped the trial and started a cheaper contract with a bus company offering a reduced service and fewer routes. The buses now run virtually empty. The trial showed that public transport can help rural life. It also showed that a transport grant is a sensitive tool; a few per cent wrongly trimmed can reduce its effect to nil.
