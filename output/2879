[normal]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Wildlife and Countryside 
[normal]Link (Link) brings together 42
[normal] voluntary organisations concerned with the conservation and protection of wildlife and the countryside. Our members practise and advocate environmentally sensitive land management, and encourage respect for and enjoyment of natural landscapes and features
[normal], the historic and marine environment and biodiversity. Taken together our members have the support of over 8 million people in the UK and manage over 750,000 hectares of land.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Link welcomes the opportunity to respond to the 
[normal]Environment, Food and Rural Af
[normal]fairs (EFRA) Select C
[normal]ommittee’s enquiry into CAP implementation 2014-2020.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This 
[normal]response is supported by the following 
[normal]14
[normal] organisations:
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Each of the four UK countries 
[normal]is
[normal] yet to determine their CAP implementation decisions and so it is impossible to determine their impact o
[normal]n
[normal] farm compet
[normal]iti
[normal]veness at this point.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, Link believes that there are three crucial decisions to be taken in each country 
[normal]context, which
[normal] if made well, would
[normal] boost both farming’s environmental performance, something which is much needed given the findings of the recent ‘State of Nature’ report
[normal], whilst also supporting improved farm compet
[normal]it
[normal]iveness. 
[normal]In an English context, Link calls upon Def
[normal]ra to
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Link 
[normal]fully supports
[normal] maximum transfe
[normal]rs from Pillar I into Pillar II
[normal]. 
[normal]15% modulation would rebalance England’s anticipated
[normal], and deeply inadequate,
[normal] Pillar II allocation and ensure existing 
[normal]agri-environment 
[normal]commitments are honoured and new agreements can be of
[normal]fered during the 2014-2020 period. This is 
[normal]critical
[normal] to ensure England’s most progressive farmers can continue to be supported through schemes which deliver clear environmental benefits
[normal] and 
[normal]deliver against 
[normal]key Defra policy objectives such as those relating 
[normal]to NATURA 2000 and the Water Framework Directive. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The transfer of funding from Pillar I into Pillar II is a well-established mechanism in the UK, in use since 2001. It has been critically important in partially compensating for 
[normal]the UK’s
[normal] disproportionatel
[normal]y low Pillar II allocation and the funds generated have been used to invest in more ambitious and effective rural development programmes
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]We believe that English farmers would be at a disadvantage if they were deprived of the 
[normal]chance  to benefit from 
[normal]knowle
[normal]dge transfer 
[normal]measures, sharing of 
[normal]best practice, 
[normal]access 
[normal]vocational training to increase skills levels, 
[normal]and to  develop 
[normal]new market opportunities
[normal] through on farm diversification
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 2007-2013 Rural Development Programme for England (RDPE) prioritised spend
[normal]ing on Environmental Stewardship schemes and given the scale of environmental need there is clear justification for continuing to do so for the successor scheme, referred to as 
[normal]NELMS.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Well-designed, targeted and funded 
[normal]agri-environment 
[normal]schemes are proven to deliver tangible 
[normal]environmental 
[normal]benefits
[normal]. The successful implementation of 
[normal]the government’s B
[normal]iodiversity 2020 strategy 
[normal]will be at risk 
[normal]if 
[normal]NELMS
[normal] 
[normal]is 
[normal]inadequately resourced.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Agri-environment schemes also have wider socio-economic benefi
[normal]ts. A report by 
[normal]the 
[normal]C
[normal]ountryside and 
[normal]C
[normal]ommunity Research 
[normal]I
[normal]nstitute
[normal] has highlighted that 
[normal]every £1 of Environmental Stewardship money 
[normal]generates a total output
[normal] in the local economy of £1.42.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In contrast, Pillar I funds work against farm compet
[normal]it
[normal]iveness by act
[normal]ing as an artificial buffer to market forces
[normal]. They also
[normal] contribute to inflated land
[normal] and rental
[normal] values
[normal], 
[normal]creating 
[normal]a hurdle to new entrants
[normal] to farming
[normal].
[normal] Even though ‘reverse modulation’ is now permitted, Link firmly believes its use in any country context woul
[normal]d further exacerbate the negative impacts of untargeted Pillar I payments  whilst at the same time further stripping away the ability of Pillar II to address the real and pressing market failure to reward
[normal] the delivery of
[normal] environmental public good
[normal]s
[normal]. As such
[normal], reverse modulation should 
[normal]not 
[normal]be used in England, or 
[normal]in 
[normal]other UK countries.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.9
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]NELMS should continue to prioritise the delivery of positive land management activities that maintain and enhance biodiversity, landscape character, and encourage public access
[normal] 
[normal]to the countryside
[normal]. This will not only help to address the market failure to reward the delivery of such environmental public goods but will also make a vital contribution to the 
[normal]economic vitality of farming and rural areas, for example through tourism.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.10
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Link welcomes Defra’s intention to make NELMS more targeted, focused and ambitious relative to Environmental Stewardship and this is fully in keeping with the leadership role England has 
[normal]played in the development of agri-environment schemes over the last 2
[normal]5 years. There are several key lessons to 
[normal]be 
[normal]learn
[normal]ed
[normal] from Environmental Stewardship, particularly the need to ensure each agreement contains the right package of land management options to deliver the intended environmental outcomes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.11
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Given that the Defra 
[normal]will be subject to budgetary cuts of 30 per cent, it is vital that these do not hinder the ability of Natural England to provide expert advice to farmers and land managers through the lifetime of 
[normal]scheme
[normal] agreements. This advice should not be viewed as a negative and burdensome ‘cost’ but rather a key component of maximising the positive environmental outcomes NELMS can deliver.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.12
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Well-designed
[normal] ‘greening’ measures c
[normal]ould
[normal] also contribute to
[normal] improve
[normal]d
[normal] competiti
[normal]veness 
[normal]by encouraging farmers to diversify their cropping choices and thus spreading risk. There are also several land management options, currently deployed under Environmental Stewardship but which could be delivered under Pillar I greening, which 
[normal]benefi
[normal]t agricultural production by supporting pollinating insects, regulating pests and supporting soil formation. In turn therefore, greening requirements 
[normal]should
[normal] be implemented in way
[normal]s
[normal] which support agricultural production and long term 
[normal]competitiveness
[normal] but in o
[normal]rder to be most effective, an ambitious approach is necessary.
[normal] Link therefore supports the use of a National Certification Scheme (see section 5).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In the UK, High Nature Value (HNV) farming – that which makes a particularly high contribution to the provision of environmental public goods - is mainly associated with low-intensity livestock systems, large
[normal]ly found in the uplands. 
[normal]Despite the environmental benefits many such systems deliver, maintaining, or indeed even reaching, economic profitability remains a challenge. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]It is also important that the Government implements part one of the Commons Act 2006
[normal] throughout England, to ensure up to date and accurate registers of common land to provide accurate base for mapping for CAP.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We are open to changes in CAP payment approaches which would uplift financial support to upland farmers 
[normal]as long as these payments
[normal] were linked to
[normal] environmental
[normal] public
[normal] goods
[normal] 
[normal]delivery and not simply a blanket payment which could perversely 
[normal]lead to negative environmental impacts e.g. intensification of in-bye land and under grazing of hill areas. In addition
[normal],
[normal] NELMS design must ensure that appropriate uplands management options and payment rates are available to encourage the uptake of additional positive management over and above that required by Pillar I requirements.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The scope
[normal] for
[normal] attaching environmental co
[normal]nditionality to Pillar I payments remains limited and the tools that are available are fairly blunt. However there is potential to secure some environmental conditionality from Pillar I via a National Certification Scheme (NCS) approach to greening. This w
[normal]ould 
[normal]increase 
[normal]the scope to include land management 
[normal]measures 
[normal]that protect and enhance upland landscapes
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The challenge for the UK’s implementing authorities will be to implement the new CAP framework so that it adequately supports and drives farmers and land mangers to address long standing environment
[normal]al
[normal] problems.  For 
[normal]complex environmental challenges complex responses are often required however this does not mean that the interface with farmers and land managers has to be complicated. Indeed we would support as user-friendly a system as possible but it is vital to recog
[normal]nise that in order to secure effectiveness in outcomes, intelligently designed and evidence based systems of delivery will be required
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Less bureaucracy and improved environmental delivery could be secured through two approaches: opting for a simple inter
[normal]pretation of the active farmer test (see 4.2) and a National Certification Scheme (NCS) which covers all farming systems (see section 5).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]M
[normal]any farming 
[normal]systems which are particularly beneficial for biodiversity and
[normal] the provision of
[normal] other 
[normal]environmental 
[normal]public goods are characterised by very low stocking rates. Defra’s approach to implementing the active farmer test must ensure that the criteria for minimum
[normal] activity are not set at a level which would exclude very extensive livestock producers – many of which would be found in the English uplands.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Research
[normal] has
[normal] identified
[normal] that
[normal] 
[normal]CAP payments are no
[normal]t
[normal] 
[normal]necessary to underpin
[normal] 
[normal]food production.
[normal] Indeed, in their absence, the likely reduction i
[normal]n food production would be less than 0.25%.
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]here the CAP does have a clear role is to support farmers to produce food and other commodities in a sustainable way
[normal],
[normal] and to adequately reward the provision of environmental 
[normal]public goods where the market fails t
[normal]o do so.
[normal] This is particularly important for those farming systems which are 
[normal]economically 
[normal]marginalised but deliver outstanding levels of public good
[normal]s
[normal] through their land management practices. We had hoped that the most recent round of reform would better lin
[normal]k environmental public good delivery with CAP payments (the ‘public money for public goods’ principle) however this has failed to materialise and as such, many marginal farms remain dependant on Pillar I payments and 
[normal]the delivery of 
[normal]their environmental pub
[normal]lic good
[normal]s
[normal] remains largely unrewarded.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2

[normal]Rather than Pillar I greening, w
[normal]e would have preferred a 
[normal]progressive 
[normal]transfer of funds into Pillar II
[normal]. However
[normal], we 
[normal]acknowledge that 
[normal]greening 
[normal]can
[normal] and must
[normal] 
[normal]play 
[normal]an important role in increasing the value for money fro
[normal]m the public spending in 
[normal]Pillar I. The greening payment 
[normal]will constitute
[normal] one third of the Pillar I budget - £5.3 billion across the UK for the period up to 2020, or approximately £495 million in England each year alone
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]his amount of money could 
[normal]deliver substantial environmental benefits if it is tied to meaningful environmental measures, 
[normal]b
[normal]ut if not, it will achie
[normal]ve little more than greenwash. 
[normal]The details of greening implementation will vary across 
[normal]England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland
[normal], bu
[normal]t there are certain principles that must be adhered to. 
[normal]Link
[normal] 
[normal]will only support an approach to greening that
[normal] 
[normal]rewards
[normal] the provision of non-marketable environmental public goods
[normal] and 
[normal]requir
[normal]es
[normal] 
[normal]all
[normal] farmers to play their part: there must be 
[normal]no exemptions from gre
[normal]ening that are not justified on the basis o
[normal]f sound 
[normal]environmental evidence.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.3

[normal]We 
[normal]believe that the best way to implement greening in England is via 
[normal]a N
[normal]ational 
[normal]C
[normal]ertification 
[normal]S
[normal]cheme
[normal], designed 
[normal]to implement 
[normal]measures
[normal] 
[normal]that help 
[normal]England’s 
[normal]varied 
[normal]farming systems
[normal] addr
[normal]ess their 
[normal]particular 
[normal]environmental challenges
[normal].
[normal] Existing certification schemes and assurance standards should not be considered 
[normal]as providing equivalence 
[normal]due to 
[normal]the
[normal] complian
[normal]ce
[normal] issues (many are focused on production methods rather than environmental outcomes)
[normal] 
[normal]with 
[normal]associated disallowance
[normal] risks
[normal].

[normal]W
[normal]e reject th
[normal]e
[normal] 
[normal]inference that Pillar I greening that is tied to meaningful environmental requirements equates to ‘
[normal]gold plating
[normal]’.
[normal] 
[normal]The greening
[normal] payment is exactly that, a payment, and not a regulatory requirement and in t
[normal]his instance, Defra’s obligation is not to farmers, but to taxpayers by ensuring value for money through clear environmental effectiveness. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The greening payment should be viewed in the same way as Pillar II agri-environment schemes are: as the means to
[normal] u
[normal]se public money to
[normal] 
[normal]reward
[normal] 
[normal]environmental
[normal] public goods
[normal] delivery
[normal]. Whilst the nature of Pillar I payments means they are more restricted
[normal] 
[normal]t
[normal]han Pillar II
[normal] (for example they are annual and non-contractual)
[normal] they can be 
[normal]used to r
[normal]e
[normal]ward
[normal] 
[normal]positive
[normal] land management which 
[normal]in turn supports food 
[normal]security by protecting
[normal] and enhancing the
[normal] natural resource
[normal] base
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The willingness of farmers to enter the Higher Level Stewardship scheme demonstrates a welcome desire to undertake sophisticated environmental management delivering 
[normal]environmental 
[normal]objectives.  Should this work be undone by cuts
[normal] to Pillar II
[normal], valuable invest
[normal]ment will be lost.
[normal] Therefore, continued use of maximum modulation should be a clear take-home message for the government.
[normal] 
[normal]In contrast, the Entry Level Scheme has delivered poor value for money.  Offering a broad and shallow scheme 
[normal]w
[normal]ithout a
[normal]dequate checks o
[normal]n agreement
[normal] quality 
[normal]has allowed numerous 
[normal]weak and unfocused agreements
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]t is imperative that every 
[normal]new scheme 
[normal]agreement offered 
[normal]provides high quality
[normal] environmental outcomes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]During the Health Check of the CAP in 2008, the then UK government expended sign
[normal]ificant political capital to secure the ability to implement a set-aside mitigation measure in cross
[normal]-
[normal]compliance. However, when it came to implementation, the Secretary of State chose to pursue a voluntary approach instead via the Campaign for the Farmed En
[normal]vironment (CFE). Whilst the CFE has certainly raised awareness among farmers about the best way to optimise 
[normal]environmental
[normal] benefit from land management options, it did not succeed 
[normal]against 
[normal]its 
[normal]original
[normal] 
[normal]objectives.
[normal] 
[normal]We therefore urge the current government to 
[normal]learn 
[normal]from 
[normal]this experience
[normal] of 
[normal]using 
[normal]voluntary approaches for environmental delivery
[normal]. Defra fought hard for the ability to apply higher rates of modulation into Pillar II, and also to use a National Certification Scheme to implement Pillar I greening. The e
[normal]vidence base which led Defra to prioritise these objectives during negotiations has not changed therefore making full use of both is the only logical
[normal] course of action.
