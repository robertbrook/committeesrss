"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by \nProfessor Gavin Phillipson, Durham Law School,\n \nUniversity of Durham\n.\n (PCD 04)\n&#xa0;\nThe core of the case for a Resolution No longer \nis ministerial responsibility merely an unwritten constitutional Convention… It is now a clear parliamentary rule, set down in resolutions by both Houses of Parliament… The government acting on its own cannot now change the terms [of this Convention] in th\ne way that the Conservative government did throughout its period in office\n.\n \nIn other words, \nonce \na \nC\nonvention is given concrete form\n through embodiment in a parliamentary resolution,\n it may not be unilaterally altered by the government of the day\n as a way of easing the constraints that conventions impose on government \naction\n when they become irksome\n.\n \n \nPassing such a resolution \nplaces the \ncontent \nof the C\nonvention in the keeping of \nP\narliament – the \nbody responsible for checking the executive\n - \nrath\ner than with the executive itself. In turn this \ndeals with \na key \nweakness \nof C\nonventions\n generally: \nthat those bound by them \nare often \nresponsible for defining \nand redefining \nthe\nir content\n, and may use that power to \nwater down \nor ev\nen em\nasculate the norm\n that \nis meant to \nbind them. \n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe views of the House of Lords Constitution Committee against formalisation of the convention. in an area as important as the use of armed force abroad, the norm should be that the Government provi\nde Parliament with the opportunity to exercise prospective oversight of executive decision-making.\n \n&#xa0;\nThe Report \nadded that it was\n:\n&#xa0;\ninconceivable that the Prime Minister would either refuse to allow a Commons debate and vote on a deployment decision, or \nwould refuse to follow the view of the Commons as expressed by a vote\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n‘\nIn some instances Parliament might want to grant consent subject to constraints on the type of action that may be undertaken. This could harm military effectiveness and limit commanders' freedom of manoeuvre.’ \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nT\nhis \nhowever \nis \nquite \nplainly \nbeside the po\nint: \nsince there is already a C\nonvention that Parliament be consulted, Parliament could already grant its consent in this way. \nT\nhis objection is \nthus \nsimply irrelevant\n to the question whether \nthe already existing Convention should be formalised. \nWhether this happens or not, in any future case of proposed military action, t\nhe terms on whic\nh any consent might be granted \nwould be set down in the specific government motion put down for approval in the House. \nT\nhe issue the Committee raises is to do with the \nterms upon which \nParliament\n should grant its consent to military action – as it must already do – and has nothing to do with the issue under discussion, which is whether or not the existing Convention should be formalised\n. \n  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe House of Commons has secured a commitment from the Government that any decision to arm the S\nyrian National Coalition should be taken only after the Commons has voted on the matter. Provision of arms to a conflict such as that in Syria was not a scenario envisaged by previous proposals for formalising Parliament's role, yet a process has been craf\nted by which the House of Commons will have its say. This demonstrates the benefits of flexibility.\n \n&#xa0;\nThe sugge\nstion seems to be, that, had a r\nesolution been passed, limiting the convention to instances in which the Government planned to take military \naction\n,\n that somehow the Commons could not have secured the commitment \nto\n \na vote before \narming the rebels. This \nhowever \nis\n clearly not the case\n: the commitment was secured because many MPs felt strongly about \nthe issue\n and were able to pass a motion. This \ncould happen\n in future\n, regardless of whether any resolution on consultation over force were passed. \nA resolution requiring a vote before using military force does not preclude votes on other issues, should the House wish to hold them. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe way forward: how should a resolution be drafted?
