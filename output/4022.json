In other words, it aims to serve its audiences not just as consumers, but as members of a wider society,\n with programmes and services which, while seeking to inform, \neducate and entertain audiences, also serve wider public purposes. Public value is a measure of the BBC’s contribution to the quality of life in the UK. \n5.  How well has the BBC performed in the current Charter period in achieving its mission and public purposes?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.  Are the public purposes in the current Charter the right ones?
