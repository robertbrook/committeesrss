March 2013\n&#xa0;Access to finance is broader than \nsimply \nbank lending and should be considered in its fullest context.\n \nIn particular, the\n availability\n of \npriv\nate equity and venture capital \nhas\n to date\n been modest in Northern Ireland\n.\n \nDanske\n Bank \nrecognises\n that \ncollaboration\n,\n rather than competition\n,\n needs to \ncharacteri\ns\ne\n the way forward to diversify financial structures for local businesses\n and to further develop\n \nthe equity and venture capital market in Northern Ireland\n.\n \nThe Bank has supported \nthe annual Insider Media Ltd Business of Finance Conference\n for several years\n, exploring the potential for venture capital and other sources of finance in the local market\n.\n \n&#xa0;The BBA (British Bankers \nAssociation) is working with the\n banks in Northern Ireland \nand with the Northern Ireland Assembly on \nproduction of \nthe \nrelevant\n lending \ndata\n.\n \nThis work includes the\n identification of the appropriate information to \nbe \ngather\ned\n,\n \nwhich must be \nrelevant to the local market dynamics \nwhile also\n \nrespecting data privacy.\n \nDanske\n Bank\n has\n fully committed to contributing to the provision\n \nof enhanced information\n,\n including \nsectoral\n data\n for the region, and would encourage other \nlocal \nbanks to do likewise. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;(i)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n Enterprise Finance Guarantee Scheme (EFGS)Danske\n Bank is a participating lender in EFG\nS\n and was one of the first subscribers to the Scheme.\n \nSince 2009 \neight \nloans with a total lending \nvalue of £1\n,\n618k\n have been drawn down\n.\n \nBefore considering an application under the \nS\ncheme, the Bank must be satisfied \nwith\n the viability of the business proposal. \nAn \nassessment of viability is based on the ability to repay the loan and the\n company’s\n cash flow quality, rather than on the security cover\n offered or available\n. The inclusion of a guarantee, such as this \nS\ncheme offers, does not inherently improve an assessment of the viability of the business.\n \nThe \nS\ncheme is one of a number of sources of support for SMEs and must be seen in the wider context of the support and funding \nDanske\n Bank already provides to customers\n.\n \nGiven that there is a\nn\n \nextra \ncost to the customer when supported under this \nS\ncheme, most customers tend to choose less expensive, conventional loans in preference to the EFG\nS\n.\n \nThe\n fact that the \nScheme\n \nin itself does not make a lending pr\noposal more viable\n for a lending institution\n, and\n that \nDanske\n \ncan often meet customer’s needs at a lower cost using conventional loans, is crucial to understanding the modest uptake of the \nS\ncheme \nin this market.\n \nDanske\n Bank’s limited u\nse of th\ne\n EFG\nS\n reflects \nthe Bank’\ns\n strength\n and success\n in conventional lending.\n(ii)               Funding for Lending SchemeDan\nsk\ne\n Bank is at the stage of \nsecuring\n approval for\n the\n Discount Window Facility – a prerequisite for participation in the \nFunding for Lending S\ncheme. At present there \nis\n not a need to draw on the \nS\ncheme as \nthe \ncurrent liquidity and funding position for \nDanske\n Bank remains very strong.\n \nThe Bank\n continue\ns\n to keep this position under active review. \n&#xa0;\n(iii)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMortgage schemes Danske\n Bank notes \nthat concerns have been raised regarding the potential for \nmortgage support \nschemes of this kind to create \ndistortionary\n effects on the housing market\n.\n \nDanske\n Bank participates in the local Co-ownership \nS\ncheme and would assess the value of participation in proposed schemes with other key stakeholders including the Council of Mortgage Lenders and the N\northern Ireland \nExecutive. \n&#xa0;\n8. Branch banking – the impact of changing customer trendsBranch closures have taken place over many decades in the local market\n.\n \nOver the past decade in particular, \nhow customers use the branch network has changed\n significantly\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nWith 53 branches \nacross Northern Ireland, \nbranches\n \nremain an extremely important channel to \nDanske\n Bank.\n \nMuch\n of the\n \nb\nanking business previously conducted at the branch counter is now done through cash machines, online, \nsmartphones\n, tablets and by telephone. These trends in turn shape the role of the branch and the decisions made regarding \nfuture \ninvestment \nin\n all bank channels.\n&#xa0;\nThe vast majority of the banks\n in\n Northern Ireland \nhave been \nrationali\ns\ning\n \ntheir branch network\n. \nDanske\n Bank has reduced its network gradually\n,\n in line with c\nhanging customer habits and across\n both urban and rural locations.\n&#xa0;\nThe percentage of customer activity by channel continues to change in \nfavour\n of new ways to bank.\n \nWhilst the decline in branch use is continual and steady, the increase in \nonline, \nmobile and tablet \nuse is sharp and unprecedented. \n&#xa0;\nS\nource: internal analysis\nC\nonsumer changes \nare necessitating ongoing reviews of the traditional \nbranch network: how branches are used by both business and personal customers, other branches in the area, the cost of maintaining the branch\n given falling transaction volumes\n, what customers use the branch for and how sustainable \na\n \nbranch is for the longer term as more investment\n is directed\n into online\n, mobile\n and telephone channels to keep pace with these changes.\nThe financial crisis has\n had\n an impact on all business, including banks, an\nd it is therefore only prudent for the \nBank \nto \nreview \nits\n cost base, alongside the \nchanging \ncustomer trends\n.\n \nIt would be \nwrong\n for any business to maintain costs that do not meet the evolving needs of its customers.\nAnalysis of transaction reductions over branch counters highlight\ns\n similar trends across \nboth urban and rural locations:\n&#xa0;\nContact Points% change 2009-2013Individual customer visits to branch counter\n-26%\nTotal Branch Network Counter Transactions\n-23%\nUrban Control Sample – Branch Counter Transactions\n-15%\nRural Control Sample – Branch Counter Transactions\n-19%\n&#xa0;\nSource: internal analysis - percentage change 2009-2013\nThe service and support provide\nd\n to consumers and to local businesses does not depend upon the number and location of branches. \nDanske\n Bank is \nable to offer banking \nservices \nthat fit into busy\n consumer lifestyles or\n the demands of running a business through the following options\n, services and programmes\n:\n&#xa0;\nIn addition to \nusing the \nbranch network, t\nhe full range of ways to bank is \nsummarised\n below:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nP\nrior to a branch closing\n,\n \nc\nustomer support sessions \nare \noffered \nover two to three weeks, for two to three days per week.\n \nThese \nsessions \nprovide dedicated time, outside of normal banking hours (typically late afternoon or early evening)\n,\n to discuss the individual banking needs \nof \nthose customers who would welcome the additional support regarding their \nfuture \nbanking options.\n&#xa0;\n9.
