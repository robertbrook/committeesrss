From April 2014, all people receiving NHS Continuing Healthcare will have the right to ask for a personal health budget, whilst clinical commissioning groups and NHS England will be able to offer PHBs more widely.&#xa0;However, as arthritis and other musculoskeletal conditions were not the dedicated focus of any of the pilot sites, Arthritis Research UK undertook work to ensure the perspectives of people with these conditions was heard.&#xa0;Our August 2012 report Personal Health Budgets presents the findings of our survey, workshop and policy seminar, and includes five recommendations for action as PHBs become more widely available on the NHS:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;For many musculoskeletal conditions, such as back pain and osteoarthritis, effective day-to-day self-management can make a substantial difference to the overall impact of the condition on a person’s health and wellbeing. We believe that a systematic approach to care planning can benefit people with arthritis and other musculoskeletal conditions, and that care planning offers important opportunities to deliver improvements in their care. &#xa0;Although the term ‘care planning’ is not used directly, NICE clinical guidelines recommend the development of a management plan for people with osteoarthritis, and the offer of an annual review to people with rheumatoid arthritis., However, recent survey estimates suggest that only 18% of people with osteoarthritis and 20% of people with rheumatoid arthritis have an agreed care plan.,&#xa0;A welcome recent development is the introduction of rheumatoid arthritis into the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) for 2013/14. In addition to maintaining a register of people with rheumatoid arthritis, GPs will be incentivised to ensure patients have an annual face-to-face review, which may provide an important opportunity to systematically integrate care planning conversations for people with rheumatoid arthritis. This is the first time that measures for people with rheumatoid arthritis have been included – other measures included are fracture and cardiovascular risk assessments. While this new addition to the QOF represents a valuable opportunity to improve the management of rheumatoid arthritis, it is also important to ensure there is effective communication between primary and secondary care.&#xa0;Musculoskeletal conditions are generally long term conditions which often fluctuate over time. For example, rheumatoid arthritis is often categorised by periods of flare-up interspersed with periods in which symptoms lessen. This is something that the care planning process should take into account. Much can be learnt from extending the model of high quality proactive care that has driven improvement in diabetes – particularly the Year of Care programme which focused on the practicalities of the delivery of care planning in primary care settings. &#xa0;Care planning should not be an isolated exercise and records and plans should be described in language which is accessible and familiar to the person involved, along with clear communication about how the process works. We welcome the development that has already been made in this area, with the recently revised NHS Constitution now including the pledge ‘to involve you in discussions about planning your care and to offer you a written record of what is agreed if you want one’. &#xa0;Over time, we wish to see care planning embedded across the NHS for people with long term conditions. In particular, we ask that NHS England meets the commitment set out in its mandate that ‘everyone with a long term condition … will be offered a personalised care plan that reflects their preferences and agreed decisions’. &#xa0;The effects of multimorbidity and ageing&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The implications of an ageing population&#xa0;&#xa0;May 2013&#xa0;&#xa0; House of Commons Health Select Committee (2013), Inquiry on the management of long term conditions: Call for evidence.
