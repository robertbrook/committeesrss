[normal]AFS0103[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Written evidence submitted by Marylebone Boys School[bold]Executive Summary[bold]Our experience in the pre-opening phase, so far, has been that the process for establishing a free school allows a parent-led proposal, without a sponsor or teaching expertise, to attract the necessary support and expertise. 
[normal]The heads of two highly regard
[normal]ed existing schools and their staff generously provided free advice and some at-cost services because they wanted children beyond their own establishments to get the benefit of their demonstrable experience and knowledge. Successful schools are likely to w
[normal]ant to see their best practice spread more widely and guiding a free school achieves this. The London Diocesan Board for Schools also provided advice and at-cost services, without asking for faith entrance criteria or intruding upon our policies or approac
[normal]h. Our local authority was helpful in integrating our admissions process closely with their own. The New Schools Network demonstrated how much has already been learnt and converted into guidance which greatly helps proposers.Â  
[normal] We found the Department eas
[normal]y to work

[normal]ld recommend a form of assurance for proposer groups to be able to give out to parents, without jeopardising site negotiations.
