defaultAFS0103default&#xa0;defaultWritten evidence submitted by Marylebone Boys SchooldefaultExecutive SummarydefaultOur experience in the pre-opening phase, so far, has been that the process for establishing a free school allows a parent-led proposal, without a sponsor or teaching expertise, to attract the necessary support and expertise. 
defaultThe heads of two highly regard
defaulted existing schools and their staff generously provided free advice and some at-cost services because they wanted children beyond their own establishments to get the benefit of their demonstrable experience and knowledge. Successful schools are likely to w
defaultant to see their best practice spread more widely and guiding a free school achieves this. The London Diocesan Board for Schools also provided advice and at-cost services, without asking for faith entrance criteria or intruding upon our policies or approac
defaulth. Our local authority was helpful in integrating our admissions process closely with their own. The New Schools Network demonstrated how much has already been learnt and converted into guidance which greatly helps proposers.Â  
default We found the Department eas
defaulty to work
