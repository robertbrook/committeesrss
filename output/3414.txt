[[[ Association (BIA)]]]

[[[ (AMR0026)]]]&#xa0;About the BIA&#xa0;The BioIndustry Association (BIA) is the trade association for innovative bioscience companies. The majority of our members are healthcare focused companies researching and developing new products and technologies to treat areas of unmet medical need. These range from large global biopharmaceuticals to small, pre-revenue companies operating at the translation interface between academia and industry. &#xa0;The BIA has engaged with its membership in order to provide an informed response to this inquiry. &#xa0;The BIA response &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;

[[[Appendix]]]&#xa0;The below table lists brief details of some of the business-led projects which have been awarded Biomedical Catalyst funding, following an application process and subject to conditions, which relate to the development of new antibiotics, anti-infectives and other research of relevance to the issue of AMR. These are projects across all application stages (feasibility, early stage and late stage) and from funding rounds one, two and three. &#xa0;
