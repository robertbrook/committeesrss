"              \nWritten evidence from the Local Government Association (WRT 044)\n&#xa0;\nDear \nLouise\n,\n&#xa0;\nWinter Readiness Survey 2013/14&#xa0;Thank you for \ninviting me to give\n evidence \nto the Transport \nSelect \nCommittee last month\n, i\nn \nrelation to \nyour\n \ninq\nuiry into winter resilience. As promised at the session, I enclose a copy of \nthe LGA’s \n2014 Winter Readiness Survey, which is also a\nvailable online at \nhttp://www.local.gov.uk/we\nb/guest/economy-and-transport-research/\n.\n&#xa0;\nHaving learnt from\n the \nexperience of the \n2010 \nwinter\n, local government has been working hard to ensure it is \nready \nto keep local areas moving in the face of significantly challenging winter weather.\n As you will \nsee from the report, c\nouncils have m\nade sure they are well-equipped. \nOn average\n,\n ea\nch council\n will be \nthis winter \nusing ten\n full-size gritters and one mini-gritter as well as ploughs, footways gritters and snow blowers.\n 95 per \ncent of councils\n \nare armed wi\nth\n the same or increased amounts of salt\n compared to last year.\n&#xa0;\nLocal government has an impressive record in finding efficiencies and innovating through new models of working\n, even when it comes to winter resilience.\n \nFor example, a\nlmost half of councils s\nurveyed will be \nsharing services \nto deliver \ntheir winter resilience programmes.\n This includes community empowerment with over 70 per cent of councils seeking to more effectively facilitate public use of grit bins\n.\n \nCommunity engagement\n will be essential\n for\n this winter’s preparations;\n 93 per cent of councils were already making plans in \nthe \nautumn for communicating their winter service plans. \nFrom a digital perspective, \n95 per cent of councils will be using their websites and social media to provide live \nupdates about gritting\n,\n which \nis expected to cover\n nearly half of their entire road networks.\n&#xa0;\nHowever, while c\nouncils\n want\n to do \neven \nmore \nof this\n sort of work\n,\n with\n cuts \nto our sector \ntotalling 43\n per cent this Parliament, \nthey\n are having to make tough d\necisions about \nwhere they prioritise resources\n.\n \nCurrent \nLGA analysis demonstrates that there will be a funding gap of £15.6 billion by 202\n0\n if Whitehall \ncontinues to \nmake \ncut\ns to\n local government. \nThis could result in councils failing their local communities as with decreasing funding and increasing demand \nthere is only so much local authorities will be able to do.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n"
