Written evidence from John Dwyer, Police and Crime Commissioner, Cheshire [CST0041][bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What, if any, targets do you set for your police force? What impact do you think this has on police recording crime practices?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The only target set by my Police and Crime Plan is that of reducing crime, there are no targets set for individual crime types nor for detection. 
[normal]However
[normal] contained within my plan there are measures to allow 
[normal]me to perform my statutory functions and hold the Chief Constable to account for the performance of the Constabulary. T
[normal]hese have been developed and agreed with the Constabulary, in order to ensure that they result in effective and meaningful data and to 
[normal]make certain
[normal] that they do not 
[normal]result in 
[normal]perverse incentiv
[normal]es, thus driving bad
[normal] practice. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How do you assure yourself that the recorded crime figures for your area are correct? To what exte[bold]nt can you trust the crime statistics for your area? [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Constabulary rigorously audits its crime recording, analysing anomalies to understand the reasons for them and this is 
[normal]scrutinised by 
[normal]me 
[normal]as part of my scrutiny processes. This process includes quarterly Public Scrutiny Boards and monthly meetings with the Chief
[normal] Constable and his Chief Officer team. 
[normal]I believe the Constabulary’s crime recording to 
[normal]be good
[normal], it was judged as such by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary in 2010 and 
[normal]I
[normal] look forward to a further inspection of crime recording in the New Year.
[normal] I have also commissioned a piece of work to be undertaken by the 
[normal]Audit Committee 
[normal]which will 
[normal]review
[normal] the integrity of crime recording practices in Cheshire and provide me with additional reassurance that standards are being properly applied.
