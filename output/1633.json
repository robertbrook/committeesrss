"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Peter Hardy, Director, JMP Consultants (TIC 067)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Recommendations for the Select Committee’s Inquiry to consider&#xa0;1.              In recognition of the higher costs involved in providing rural bus services, find ways of compensating (or rewarding) operators that provide commercial bus services in rural areas. This could be achieved through paying higher rates of Bus Service Operator Grant (BSOG) for rural services.&#xa0;2.               The ability for rural dwellers to access some key services can be worsened as facilities become more centralised or located away from bus routes. Government should ensure that all public bodies are required to locate services and facilities in locations that are well served by public transport.&#xa0;3.              The funding provided to local authorities for community transport by Department for Transport (DfT) in 2011/12 and 2012/13 was most welcome. It is disappointing, however, that there has been no comprehensive overview of what has been achieved with this across the country. It is recommended that DfT seeks some feedback from each authority to highlight any good practice or learning points that might be transferable elsewhere. This is something that the Association of Transport Co-ordinating Officers (ATCO) might be able to undertake for the DfT.&#xa0;4.              The integrated planning and provision of passenger transport services is crucial to the maintenance of effective rural services.  Whilst local authorities are responsible for various types of transport, it can be difficult to engage with the NHS on its transport, resulting in lost opportunities for economies of scale. Government should require NHS trusts to integrate their non-emergency patient transport provision with local authority transport interests, potentially handing responsibility to local authorities (linking with the recent move of public health responsibilities to local authorities).  NHS trusts could commission local authorities to arrange / procure transport on its behalf alongside arrangements made for special education and social care. &#xa0;5.               Flexible, responsive transport services will become increasingly important in rural areas. Therefore, the ability to design these to best meet particular needs is vital. The current requirement for demand responsive services to be pre-booked by passengers (in order to satisfy local bus registration and BSOG requirements) can add a barrier to the use of some such services. Therefore, the DfT is asked to review the requirement for pre-booking of such services.  &#xa0;&#xa0;Introduction&#xa0;\nIt is pleasing to see that the Select Committee has chosen to consider issues concerning transport in isolated communities. Over the years in local government and in consultancy I have developed public transport services in rural areas. I am currently working with Herefordshire Council, assisting in various aspects of service change and development. I have therefore chosen to provide this evidence, using Herefordshire to illustrate a number of points. \nThe information provided reflects may own personal views, rather than those of Herefordshire Council. \n&#xa0;\nHerefordshire is a very rural area where transport is always high on the agenda, particularly regarding access to services. Whilst the Council puts much effort into initiatives to promote accessibility, reducing budgets make this ever more challenging. \n&#xa0;\nNationally, the economic downturn has led government to focus on schemes that might promote growth. Consequently, significant resources are being given to strategic transport projects and to the provision of road and rail infrastructure. Beyond Local Sustainable Transport Funding (which has been most welcome), Department for Transport initiatives for local public transport have been biased towards urban areas (such as Better Bus Areas and Green Bus Fund). Unfortunately, rural areas have not had the attention they deserve. Equally, as budgets for supporting local bus services are cut back, rural areas suffer more, as a greater proportion of services in rural areas are supported than in urban areas.    \n&#xa0;\nIssues for public transport in Herefordshire&#xa0;\nHerefordshire has a traditional pattern of conventional bus services, which radiate out from \nHereford\n to the surrounding market towns and operate on regular frequencies (mainly hourly). A number of these services have developed as longer distance inter-urban services, continuing to destinations such as \nGloucester\n and \nCardiff\n. Areas that lie between these key routes are served by a mix of irregular, infrequent or market day only services.  The network is based on historic patterns of provision, with usage holding up most in communities that have consistently been well served.\n&#xa0;\nWhilst two of the large bus groups, Stagecoach and First, operate in Herefordshire, they do not dominate. There are a number of smaller bus companies providing services. First has a depot in \nHereford\n itself, from which it operates services within the city. Stagecoach operates a number of inter-urban services, with Ross-on-Wye and \nHereford\n being at the northern limits of networks based in \nSouth Wales\n and Gloucestershire.   \n&#xa0;\nSeven community transport schemes nominally provide transport (minibus and voluntary car) across all parts of Herefordshire, all offering different levels of provision. \n&#xa0;\nKey challenges for public transport in Herefordshire \nareas\n follows:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe need for savings and change&#xa0;In response to local authority budget cuts, Herefordshire Council is seeking to make significant savings in the provision of passenger transport services.  Internally, it is integrating its small teams that deal with local bus, education and social care transport. In parallel, we are embarking on a \nnetwork review of all contracted services in an attempt to achieve economies of scale and efficiencies through integration. \n&#xa0;\nThrough a recent consultation to refresh the Local Transport Plan, the concept of moving towards a network of primary (core) services with feeders has been promoted. In parallel, we are working with community transport providers to increase capacity and encourage them to provide a greater variety of activities. As part of its savings plan, the Council is seeking to be more of a commissioning authority, rather than an involvement in direct provision. In this respect, we are looking to equip community transport to not only provide local transport, but to become local transport advocates, working with communities to find grass roots solutions to potential transport needs that fall outside the principal route network.\n&#xa0;Response to particular questions posed by the Select Committee&#xa0;\n1.  How is demand in isolated areas identified?&#xa0;\nDemand is gauged on current usage. Bus operators are risk averse and prefer to try and retain current users rather than seek to change things in the hope of attracting new users. In a rural area this is a fair argument, as service frequencies are never going to be suitably attractive to car users; most rural bus services are there to provide access for those who don’t have a car available.\n&#xa0;\nThe bus network tends to reflect historic patterns of demand. Limited budget means that services can only meet basic needs for access to shops, education and some employment opportunities. Generally, access will only be available to a local market town and/or \nHereford\n. There is limited choice of destination and travel time; a number of inter-urban services run hourly, but most rural services are much less frequent.\n&#xa0;\nAs well as current usage, demand is also gauged through requests received and requirements expressed by Parish Councils and elected members.\n&#xa0;\n2.  How are the needs of different groups met?&#xa0;\nServices are generally accessible and available to all. For the reasons outlined in (1) above, services tend to be designed to meet the needs of those who don’t have a car available, such as older people.\n&#xa0;\nAn issue in rural areas is how comprehensive services can be. For larger communities that lie along core routes, reasonable levels of bus services exist. Smaller isolated communities may only have one or two buses per week. Consequently, geography does have an influence on what levels of service are provided.  \n&#xa0;\n3.  What are the main challenges?&#xa0;\nThe main challenges in Herefordshire are trying to maintain a balance of provision, with sufficient levels of service to be attractive, and maintaining some level of access to all. Equally, it is important to avoid diluting what services provide (i.e. trying to serve so many different communities that routes become convoluted and slow, and service patterns become overly complex and poorly understood).\n&#xa0;\nUnderstanding the market and working with it is crucial in achieving this balance. Therefore, building good working relationships with bus operators is important. In moving towards the provision of a primary network with feeder services, it is intended that more passengers will be fed into \ncommercial services to help maintain them as viable operations and hopefully encourage further investment by operators.\n&#xa0;\nWorking with all types of providers is necessary. Hence encouragement is being given to the community transport sector to play a greater role. The challenge here is supporting schemes to build capacity and capability.  \n&#xa0;\n4.  Community transport&#xa0;\nCommunity transport can play an important part in the overall picture. Currently, the operators in Herefordshire tend to be focused on meeting the needs of particular groups (such as older and disabled people), or on providing particular types of journeys (such as medical). Schemes are generally small scale with limited vehicle and staff resources; for example, each offers quite limited office opening hours for bookings. Consequently, they have limited interest in broadening their horizons, such as the operation of contracts (school and / or social care transport).\n&#xa0;\nThere are significant opportunities for community transport in the future. However, new ways of thinking will need to be adopted. In general, we are seeking to encourage schemes to become involved in more general transport service provision, complementing the main bus network, rather than just providing for specific needs. One scheme has already adopted the ‘feeder service’ concept. Where users are able to use public transport, the voluntary car scheme will pick them up from home and take them to / from the bus stop, to complete their journey by bus, rather than convey them by car for the full journey.\n&#xa0;\nOne scheme is starting to recruit new types of volunteers, such as people who work during the week, but want to do some voluntary activities at the weekend. This has enabled the scheme to offer its voluntary car service on a Saturday as well as weekdays.\n&#xa0;\nWe are currently working with the community transport sector as a whole to encourage schemes to collaborate with regards to bookings for transport, such that by working together they can extend the times when enquiries and bookings can be taken.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.  Taxis / DRT&#xa0;\nIn rural areas, more flexible types of transport have to be part of the solution. Certainly, the Council is dependent on taxi and private hire operators to provide journeys to school and for social care purposes. Therefore, these vehicles are a resource that can be exploited to offer complementary public transport, such as in providing feeders to the core network. \n&#xa0;\nAs time goes on, the relevance of once-per-week market day only buses will diminish. This will provide the opportunity to introduce more demand responsive services. It will be crucial to co-ordinate the provision of all types of small vehicle and specialist transport services (social care, school, medical patients, community transport etc) to ensure efficiencies and economies of scale are achieved. \n&#xa0;\n6.  Challenges of funding&#xa0;\nFunding to provide services that meet the many demands is decreasing. Therefore, it is vital to achieve the best use of all resources through co-ordination; either by achieving greater utilisation of vehicles or by amalgamating passenger demands. Avoiding duplication of activities by co-ordinating with other organisations will be important. \n&#xa0;\nIn order to minimise calls on the Council to support services, the aim must be to maintain as much of the transport network as commercially viable. As described earlier, the aim of developing rural hubs on key corridors (into which feeder services operate and which offer park and ride) is part of the strategy to achieve this. \n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
