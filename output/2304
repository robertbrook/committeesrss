[normal]Susan Morgan â€“ Written evidence[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]As an enthusiastic and experienced country walker in England and Wales I am writing to support two proposals to put into the Bill.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]One is that all unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic, and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads should be recognised as 
[normal]not
[normal] being part of the ordinary roads network, and should be re-classified as Restricted Byways.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Secondly, when a Local Authority declines to impose a Traffic Regulation Order that has wide public support, there should be a right of appeal. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Having come across green lanes which have been considerably damaged, it is essential for their preservation that these two proposals are included in the Bill to prevent continual further damage.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Thanking you for your attention in this matter.
[normal]&#xa0;
