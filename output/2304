defaultSusan Morgan â€“ Written evidencedefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultAs an enthusiastic and experienced country walker in England and Wales I am writing to support two proposals to put into the Bill.
default&#xa0;
defaultOne is that all unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic, and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads should be recognised as 
defaultnot
default being part of the ordinary roads network, and should be re-classified as Restricted Byways.
default&#xa0;
defaultSecondly, when a Local Authority declines to impose a Traffic Regulation Order that has wide public support, there should be a right of appeal. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHaving come across green lanes which have been considerably damaged, it is essential for their preservation that these two proposals are included in the Bill to prevent continual further damage.
default&#xa0;
defaultThanking you for your attention in this matter.
