defaultOvercoming the poverty gradient for schools in England: a summary of some recent evidence

default&#xa0;
default1.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultClosing the social 
defaultclass achievement gap or ‘poverty gradient’ in education is a prominent policy reform issue in the UK, as it is in many other developed countries. And billions of pounds of public money has been, and is being, spent on generic or tailored intervention
defaults
default to 
defaultaddress it. However, these interventions are largely untested, or where they have been rigorously and independently evaluated they have been shown not to work or even to be harmful. 
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRecent work has shown, for example, that almost all interventions to imp
defaultrove the attainment of disadvantaged pupils by altering attitudes, aspirations or behaviour have no evidence base or have been shown not to work (Gorard 2012). This is also so for attempts to improve post-compulsory participation, and applies to the attitu
defaultdes and behaviour of parents as well as young people and children. The same problem arises when assessing the evidence for interventions simply based on increasing or altering the timing and delivery mechanisms for education. Provision of summer schools, S
defaultaturday clubs, IT equipment and even teaching assistants in themselves make no difference (Gorard and See 2013). 
defaultAspiration without increased competence makes no difference whereas increased competence can lead to changes in aspiration, for example. In the
default same way, more school, faster delivery or smaller groups make no difference unless the activities undertaken are effective. But if the activities are effective then it is not clear that the others changes matter. A new example of this will be the first re
defaultport of a randomised controlled trial funded by the Educational Endowment Foundation (Gorard et al. 2013). Switch-on Reading was found to be a promisingly effective intervention for children moving to secondary school with low reading scores (around 3 mont
defaulths gain in reading age), capable of being conducted by teaching assistants. The intervention was most effective for the very lowest attainers, and those with special educational needs.
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOne of the reasons why money is being directed towards unproven, ineff
defaultective or harmful interventions is that the quality of the 
defaultevidence available is generally so poor. And this is despite further billions of pounds of public money spent on generating such evidence. It is crucial that there is, in future, greater discrimina
defaulttion between attempts to provide good research evidence for wider use, and the rest. This is illustrated in the remainder of this submission by a summary of a new review of evidence 
defaultlinking interventions to improve parental engagement in their children’s e
defaultducation with improved attainment
default, conducted for the Nuffield Foundation
default (
defaultSee and 
defaultGorard 2013)
default. 
defaultThe review illustrates that there is not yet enough evidence that any intervention will work, and also that a far higher standard of basic evaluation is require
defaultd, and should be demanded by 
defaultall 
defaultfunders.
default The implications for policy-makers are in the final paragraphs 5.9 to 5.11. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default2.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPrevious reviews have shown that there is a strong association between parental involvement in 
defaulttheir child’s education and th
defaultat
default child’s subsequent attainment. This means that, on average, a child with parent(s) 
defaultfully 
defaultengaged in their learning will do better on standardised tests of attainment than a child without such parents. 
default[
defaultThe term ‘parent’ sho
defaultuld be taken 
defaulthere 
defaultto include foster parents, carers and responsible adults 
defaultin any form of family structure
default]. If disadvantaged pupils are less likely to have engaged parents then this could be part of the solution to the poverty gradient. 
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPrevious work 
defaulthas suggested a range
default of plausible ways in which this
default association could arise. These include 
defaultgetting 
defaultthe parent
defaults
default 
defaultto act
default as a kind of substitute teacher providing home tutorials, 
defaultor
default as a role model, creating appropriate learning spaces in the home, and maki
defaultng the culture of school and home more similar so that school becomes less threatening to a young child. Any of these explanations for
default the association might be true. However, r
defaultobust evaluations of interventions 
defaultto increase parental involvement and assess t
defaulthe impact of this on children’s attainment 
defaultare far fewer t
defaulthan the studies of association
default, and also far fewer than studies that have simply shown that parental involvement can be increased (but without testing whether this makes a difference to attainment).
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDespite this, considerable public funding and policy and practice effort has been devoted to increasing parental involvement in England precisely in order to improve school outcomes. At present, these actions are not evidence-informed (or rather they ar
defaulte ‘informed’ by over-claiming on the basis of studies of association). These actions could be wasteful, an inefficient use of public funds or even harmful to the intended beneficiaries. Therefore, this new review was commiss
defaultioned to clarify the situation.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMost of the studies in the review came from searching the main on-line databases for education, psychology and sociology – 
defaultERIC, PsycInfo, ASSIA, Australian Education Index, British Educational Index, Social Services Abstracts
default, Sociological Abstracts, 
defaultInternational Bibliography of the Social Sciences, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. The results were 
defaultextended by
default medical databases, key contacts, existing knowledge, hand searching of journals, bibliographies, and websites i
defaultncluding Google Scholar, 
defaultPsycARTICLES, MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library.
default 
defaultThe search was as inclusive as possible in identifying a wide range of both published and unpublished literature, to prevent publication bias, but was limited to studies published in 
defaultEnglish between 1990 and 2012. This 
defaultsearch 
defaultyielded 756 distinct reports, which were check
defaulted to see
default that they were indeed relevant (i.e. a randomised controlled trial or similar reasonably robust 
defaultdesign for 
defaultevaluation of a parental intervention to improve c
defaulthildren’s attainment).
default Any studies thought not to meet the inclusion criteria were reviewed by the other members of the research team for consensus. On this simple basis, a further 688 studies were excluded, leaving 68. These 
default68 
defaultwere judged to be relevant,
default empirical and described in sufficient clarity to make judgements about the quality of the evidence. 
defaultEach study was then 
defaultsummarised in terms of
default 
defaultits
default 
defaultpurpose, meth
defaultods, outcomes, and limitations.
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultS
defaulttudies will have been missed
default due
default to imperfections in the search, and the necessary time limits on applying exclusion criteria. 
defaultHowever, it is very unlikely that the studies not found in the search were disproportionately the missing high quality ones, or would alter the picture below. Th
defaulte findings of the review are secure. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default4.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe have shown elsewhere, in a more widespread review, that there is plenty of reasonable descriptive evidence associating levels of parental involvement with levels of child attainment
default (Gorard
default et al. 2012)
default. The question this new review considered was whether the act of enhancing parental involvement through intervention leads to improved educational outcomes. This required a different kind of research design, of a substantial size, with a clear
default and fair counterfactual. We found no such study, and this has to be the headline finding for the review. Despite all of the practitioner, policy and state-funded investment in enhancing parental engagement in education across the world, we could not find 
defaultone high quality study that evaluated its impact. 
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis new review 
defaultincludes
default the highest quality evaluations 
defaultin terms of answering the key causal question about whether higher parental involvement creates higher attainment for their children
default. However
default, no 
defaultrelevant study was deemed to be high quality or e
defaultven anywhere near high quality. 
defaultEach study 
defaultlocated 
defaulthad 
defaultt
defaultwo
default or more
default serious flaw
defaults
default, such
default as
default being too small (most had fewer than 30 cases), no baseline equivalence between comparator groups, high or 
defaultunequal dr
defaultopout after allocation to groups, and misuse of statistical techniques.
default Seven studies were deemed to be large enough with some attempt at creating a suitable comparator, and so were rated as medium in quality.
default The remaining studies
default were all of low quality with three or more serious flaws.
default 
defaultThere are so few studies of consequence that a traditional meta-analysis is not possible.
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOverall, 
defaultand even taken at face value, 
defaultthese
default 
default68 
defaultstudies present a mixed and far from encouraging picture f
defaultor the success of parental interventions.
default Of the best, some have suggested positive outcomes, some no effect, and some that parental involvement interventions may actually harm children’s attainment. 
defaultMany of the studies with positive outcomes involve compl
defaultex interventions 
defaultincluding
default more than parental involvement (such as additional classes
default at school as well). W
defaulthere these 
defaultdifferent 
defaultelements 
defaulthave been separated
default,

defaulteffective 
defaultrather than
default the parental involvement. 
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis means that 
defaultthe promise of improving
default attainment by enhancing parental involvement 
defaultis less
default than appeared to be the case when this new review was commissioned.
default 
defaultHowever, our previous work has shown that the situation for many other possible interventions 
defaultis even worse. In terms of individual behaviours and attitudes, parental involvement remains the most
default promising approach. 
default&#xa0;
default4.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe studies that were found are presented in terms of the ages of the children involved.
default&#xa0;
defaultPre-school age children
default&#xa0;
default4.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere were ten studies relevant to pre-school age that claimed or reported 
defaultunclear/
defaultnegative impact 
defaultfrom
default increased parental interventions, and all were deemed of low quality. Many of these 
defaultwe
defaultre tiny, with group sizes for analysis 
defaultas low as
default 
defaulteight, as well as
default high drop out of cases after allocation to groups
default. 
defaultOne had a control group but ignored it. 
defaultOne 
defaultresearcher 
defaultused their own test without calibration, one used changes in behaviour rather than tests to make claims about attainment, and one claimed positive 
defaultresults for teacher-reported outcomes but found no gains
default using a standardised test. The latter
default 
defaultgroup are instructive because they suggest
default we should not rely on bespoke tests, indirect indications or simple self- or teacher- reports. 
default&#xa0;
default4.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere were thirteen s
defaulttudies relevant to pre-school age reporting largely positive results, and ten of these were deemed low quality. Again many were small, with treatment groups 
defaultas small as
default 14
default pupi
defaultls
default, without randomisation or clear prior matching
default between treatment and comparis
defaulton groups
default. One study had 
defaultclearly unbalanced comparator groups from the outset. Another had 45% dropout after allocation to groups
default. One even quoted effect sizes for gains in a parental volunteer group compared to those parents who refused to participate, an
defaultd claimed that these were the 
default‘
defaulteffects
default’
default of the programme.
default&#xa0;
default4.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe three medium quality studies with positive outcomes were
default all of the same intervention, reporting after different times had elapsed. The successful intervention was
default 
defaultthe Chicago Child-Parent Cent
defaultre Programme (CPC), which 
defaultwa
defaults a federally funded pre-school programme for families in high poverty areas in Chicago. 
defaultIt
default included
default parental training with a child-centred focus on developing reading and language skills. However, it also include
defaultd
default teacher-directed whole class instruction, small group activities, field trips and play, low child to staff ratios in kindergartens, outreach activities including home visits, staff development activities, 
defaultand an enriched classroom environment for developi
defaultng reading and math skills, 
defaultplus health and nutrition services. This complex intervention took place 3 hours per day 5 days per week over 9 months with a 6-week summer programme, plus the provision of ‘continuing services’. The programme was originally mea
defaultnt for pre-school children up to 3
defaultrd
default grade and was run within pre-school centres. These centres are now part of the Chicago Public School system. In every CPC there is a staffed parent resource room, and the programme requires active parental participation
default. Parents must commit to volunteer at the CPC on 
defaulta 
defaultweekly basis.
default 
defaultAround 1,400 mostly African American children were tracked through to age 28, with about 15 to 20% dropout. The researchers claimed that CPC had positive effects on the Iowa Test of Basic Ski
defaultlls (ITBS), attendance and high school completion. However because of the multiple components of the programme it was not clear 
defaultwhat the impact of
default parental involvement 
defaultwas specifically, or even if it had any impact at all. 
defaultThe intervention has also altered
default since its inception, moving from pre-school to school-age (up to 9) and becoming more institutionalised. What is needed now is a much clearer evaluation of only the parental involvement component of this intervention for a specific age group, and in a pre
default-specified format.  
default&#xa0;
default4.9
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOverall, it is difficu
defaultlt to conclude that there is much
default solid evidence of effective parental interventions for pre-school children despite the widely held belief that early interventions will be the most effective.

default4.10
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe review found nine 
defaultstudies of parental involvement with primary age 
defaultchildren that showed unclear/
defaultnegative outcomes. 
defaultSix of these were deemed of low quality. 
defaultTwo were so small as to be negligible (5 cases per arm), and another was so poorly de
defaultscribed in terms of the sample reported that it is not possible to say how large or small it 
defaultwa
defaults. One, like so many summarised, completely misused the technique of significance testing. One dredged by trying to find a positive result through the removal of
default ‘outliers’ (possibly inconvenient results). In perhaps the best 
defaultof these weak studies
default, the comparison group performed substantially better than the treatment group. 
default&#xa0;
default4.11
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe other th
defaultree studies that showed unclear/
defaultnegative outcomes were deemed 
defaultof medium qual
defaultity. 
defaultThe Family-School Partnership programme 
defaultimproved
default parent-teacher communication. It involved using teachers and health professionals t
defaulto train parents in teaching 
defaultliteracy and numeracy
default, and child behaviour management skills
default. It started with a three day s
defaulteminar for teachers and relevant school personnel, training them in parent-teacher communication and partnership building. Teachers received a t
defaultraining manual, 
defaultvideotape
default,
default 
defaultand 
defaulttraining aids, plus additional support after the training. Programme experts visi
defaultted schools during the intervention to supervise and offer feedback. There were nine parent workshops run by the 1
defaultst
default grade teachers, social workers and school psychologist
defaults
default, with weekly home-school learning 
defaultand communication activities. 
defaultThe evaluation was a longitudinal study involving a total of 678 students from nine schools. 
defaultClasses were randomly allocated to one of three groups 
defaultwho were tracked from first grade to age 19. One group received the parental intervention, one a classroom i
defaultntervention, and one acted as a control. Around 16% dropped out after allocation. Regression analysis suggested 
defaultthat 
defaultthe classroom intervention had positive effects on reading and maths performance using the the Kaufman tests of Educational Achievement, bu
defaultt no impact on
default high school graduation. There was no overall difference on any outcome due to the family intervention. 
default&#xa0;
default4.12
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe LiFuS programme involved training parents to support their children at home with their reading homework, and training teachers in co
defaultoperative learning activities a
defaultt
default school to enhance children’s reading motivation 
defaultand comprehension
default. 
defaultThe home r
defaulteading programme was for 2
default0 minutes three times per week
default, using 4
defaultth
default grade students in Switzerland. It 
defaultemphasised supporting child’s autonomy in re
defaultading, by avoiding controlling and interfering 
defaultbehavior,
default and using
default autonomy supportive strategies
default. Parents should provide reading materials such as dictionaries and remain nearby to answer questions
default, but allow the child to
default read silently at their own pace. 
defaultInstead of giving them the complete solutions to queries, parents were instructed to provide strategies for the child to use. Parents needed to familiarise themselves with three strategies (background knowledge, predicting and summarising) to facilitate pr
defaulte- and post-reading discussions. Before implementation, parents attended two training sessions each lasting three hours, held in the evening in the child’s school. In the first training session, parents were shown a video demonstrating the theoretical aspe
defaultcts of the homework intervention. In the second training session, parents practised strategies with their chi
defaultld on how to support 
defaulttheir reading homework in a semi-authentic homework situation. Parents were supported throughout the intervention with persona
defaultl coaching. In addition, they received instructional booklets with the content of the training session (to refer to whenever they needed). Children were given a checklist to help them remember the steps of the strategy used.
default 
defaultA total of
default 713 children took pa
defaultrt in the evaluation
default, divided into 
defaultthree
default groups: school intervention, school/home intervention and a control group. The control group was merely matched with the intervention groups, and known differences between the groups controlled for. Although the aut
defaulthors reported that the programme had significant effects on students’ enjoyment in reading and reading motivation, it did not have any positive effect on reading comprehension tests. Both interventions (school only and home/school) 
defaultactually 
defaulthad small negat
defaultive effects on text comprehension compared to the control group, suggesting that students might have been better off without the intervention. 
defaultPerhaps increased enjoyment of reading itself 
defaultdid not translate 
defaultin
defaultto performance in reading comprehension because
default comprehension requires certain skills which needed to be taught. This means that students can be motivated to do well, but to actually do well they need the competence to do so.
default&#xa0;
default4.13
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAn earlier study evaluated a school-collaborated programme involving parents
default helping their children to read at home using prescribed activities. The aim of the intervention was to help enhance children’s vocabulary and comprehension, as well as their self-esteem. 
defaultParents in the experimental group attended one training session, whe
defaultre they had to commit to a 14-week parental involvement programme. At the sessions they were given materials, and discussed the topics in these handouts. The topics were about issues like building self-esteem, how to support their child in their reading, h
defaultow to help their child to cope with stress and to create a stress-free environment for the child. Parents also received vocabulary and comprehension exercises and were shown, using role play, how to re
defaultinforce reading skills at home. 
defaultThis is an important st
defaultudy because it is a straight comparison between parental involvement or not (and is the only such study of medium quality found in the review). 
defaultIn five schools, teachers and 
defaulttheir 
default230 students were allocated in an unspecified manner to the ‘treatment’ or ‘
defaultcomparator’ group, but around 15% dropped out after allocation. 
defaultT
defaulthe comparison group made slightly greater improvements in reading attainment than the treatment children (ES = -0.20)
default, as assessed by the standardised Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test (GMRT).
default Th
defaultis suggests that increasing parental involvement was harmful. 
default&#xa0;
default4.14
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere were 
defaulta further 
default14 studies with positive
default,
default or elements of positive
default,
default results. 
defaultAll of these were of low quality. A
defaultgain many of these studies were negligible in scale, with 
defaultas few as
default 
defaultseven
default 
defaultpupils 
defaultper arm of the study. 
defaultOne 
defaultstudy used a total of 3 cases. Other studies had high levels of attrition such as 31% in one of the groups after allocation. Three had no matching comparator (or maybe just a nearby school), one used a bespoke test that did
default not translate into real-life achievement and another relied on self-reported achievements only. 
default&#xa0;
default4.15
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOverall, there is 
defaultno
default evidence here that primary age interventions to enhance parental involvement are generally effective in increasing children’s attainment
default. 
defaultIn fact, the better studies suggest the interventions can be harmful. It may be important that all of the medium quality negative studies so far are largely about training parents to act a little like teachers at home, whereas the medium quality positive
default study involves parents and other adults meeting and working together in an institution of some sort. It is also note
defaultworthy
default that when parental involvement has been compared to a classroom intervention with the same purpose, 
defaultif there is a difference 
defaultit is t
defaulthe classroom programme that is more successful.   
default&#xa0;
defaultSecondary age children
default&#xa0;
default4.16
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe review found fewer interventions aimed solely at young people of secondary school age. This is presumably because of the widespread belief that earlier interventions will be 
defaultmore effective. The
defaultre were
default six studies reporting 
defaultunclear/
defaultnegative results overall
default, and all of these were low quality. Problems
default with these studies
default i
defaultnclude
defaultd
default very small samples, 
defaultand confusion
default abo
defaultut what the results really are. O
defaultne 
defaultstudy 
defaultsuggested that
default prior a
defaultttainment 
defaultwa
defaults the key to outcomes. The latter is important because, if true, it means we cannot trust any studies that either do not take prior attainment into account
default,
default or 
defaultthat 
defaultdo not 
defaultmake it irrelevant by having large randomly allocated groups. 
default&#xa0;
default4.17
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere we
defaultre five studies reporting positive results. Four of these were of low quality, including some very small samples – with as 
defaultfew
default as 14 pupils per group. The latter study also contains some negative results not clearly presented. One study is substantially
default la
defaultrger but has no comparator.
default 
default&#xa0;

defaultOne study with positive results was of near-medium quality. 
defaultBridges to High School

default 
defaultwa
defaults a family-focused programme to reduce problems associated with transition to secondary school. 
defaultIt lasted for nine 
defaultweek
defaults
default in the 8
defaultth
default grade
default, and
default 
defaultcombined
default parent and child education 
defaultwith family support. It involved
default a parenting intervention, adolescent sessions and family sessions, plus 
defaulttwo home visits 
default(one pre and one during intervention). 
defaultParenting 
defaultsessions were aimed at 
defaulthelping parents
default understand school expectations, improving parent-teacher communication 
defaultenhancing parenting skills using positive reinforcement, 
defaultmonitoring and appropriate discipline, and reducing harsh parenting
default. In adolescent sessions, students were taught coping strate
defaultgies, managing interpersonal and school problems, exploring goals and motivations and balancing family relationships with other obligations/interests. Family sessions provid
defaulted
default structured opportunities for mutual understanding, enjoyment and communication, 
defaultand to practice skills learnt in parent and adolescent sessions. The leaders of sessions were trained in the intervention, for 45 hours beforehand, and five additional hours per week during the intervention. A school liaison officer was available to suppor
defaultt families.
default 
defaultAround 500 students were randomly allocated to treatment or not, and around 27% dropped out later especially in the non-treatment group. The authors reported positive effects on students’ GPA. It is difficult to isolate the active ingredient as
default there are so many aspects to the intervention including parental training, home visits and adolescent behaviour training. The outcome measures are heavily dependent on self-reporting scales with less emphasis on independent observation/records
default, and in the
default analysis no account was taken of the differential dropout
default. 
default&#xa0;
default4.19
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOverall, on this evidence, it is 
defaultcurrently 
defaultnot possible to conclude that 
defaultthe kinds of parental involvement
default interventions 
defaultcovered here 
defaultwill be effective in secondary phases. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAcross age groups
default&#xa0;
default4.20
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere were a small number of studies about interventions for children across age groups (e.g. from pri
defaultmary to first year of secondary
default school
default). Three of these included a combination of strategies, two were about training parents and two involved getting par
defaultents to work with their children at home. One was a home-school collaboration intervention. 
defaultF
defaultive of the reports had negative/
defaultunclear outcomes, and all were deemed low quality. Two studi
defaultes of the same intervention had very high dropout, another had
default clearly 
defaulttried to dredge for positive results and d
defaultid
default not report the negative ones properly. The other
defaults 
defaultalso 
defaulthad
default problems 
defaultboth 
defaultwith high dropout and apparently selective reporting of results.
default&#xa0;
default4.21
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe four reports claiming positive outcomes were generally just as
default poor. 
defaultTwo ha
defaultd
default small
default cell size
defaults (as low as 15)
default. One had
default no match between classes in the two groups, and another ha
defaultd
default a 
defaultconflict of interest and reported
default only the successful results. 
default&#xa0;
default4.22
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis is a very unpromising set of studies of parental involvement for chi
defaultldren in transition between school phases. On balance, they provide no sound basis for claiming the success of all-age interventions to increase parental involvement. The largest study in this group by some way (445+ cases) report
defaulted
default no difference in outcom
defaultes between the parental intervention treatment group and the others.

defaultGiven the absence of high quality evaluations encountered in this review, the first task of funders must be to remedy the situation. This can be done by calling for new primary research with specific characteristics, and ceasing to fund mere associational 
defaultor supposedly explanatory work in this area. The new research should be a fair test of whether the most promising approaches to enhancing parental involvement actually work in the sense of cost-effectively improving children’s subsequent attainment. The re
defaultsearch should involve several studies, both direct replications and of differing age groups, based in real-world settings. The design for each should be either a simple randomised comparison of a treatment and control group, or of an allocation using regre
defaultssion discontinuity. There should be around 1,000 pupils or more in each study, with very low attrition, perhaps through using a waiting-list design or other incentive to reduce post-allocation demoralisation, followed by an intention to treat analysis.

defaultThe procedures of the intervention and its evaluation should ideally be ‘blinded’ as far as possible, and 
defaultfor many steps this is simple (for example, by 
defaultconducting the pre-test for all cases before randomisation). The evaluation must be conducted by indivi
defaultduals with no concern for whether the intervention works or not, but concern only for finding out. The outcome measure used, such as a test of student learning, must be standardised, independent of the innovators of the intervention, and have real-world me
defaultaning (such as 
defaulta link to 
defaultKey Stage results). The intervention itself should be as simple as possible, not mixing parental involvement with any other elements of change or intervention (and applied only to the treatment group). After the intervention has be
defaulten completed for one large group but not the other, both groups should be assessed or measured for the single pre-specified outcome that the intervention was intended to improve. The result should be 
defaultbased on
default a simple comparison of the outcomes or gain sco
defaultres for each group.

defaultThis advice is quite generic, and will apply to other topic areas as well, but it is necessary because of the very low level of quality found, even among the best evaluations. The level of work encountered is so far from that needed to
default answer relevant questions for public policy that even adopting these rather basic recommendations would lead to a considerable improvement.

defaultMore generally, funders need to ensure that programmes and fields of research make suitable progress, or cease fu
defaultnding them. Research must work towards answers. This means that exploratory work is perfectly proper, but that when the results show promise the researchers must continue to developmental work, leading eventually to a fully-fledged trial. Good ideas must b
defaulte pursued to a gainful end in this way and poor ideas discarded. Currently too much work is mired in a repetitive phase of exploration without progress. This is an unethical use of t
defaultaxpayer and charitable funding.

defaultTo a large exte
defaultnt the implications for researchers follow those for funders. In this area, as in so many others, researchers must wake up to their ethical responsibilities to the public and to research funding bodies. They must see their work as part of an ongoing and la
defaultrger research cycle working towards an evaluation (of what works, a theory, or an artefact such as curriculum materials). They must ensure that promising work moves to a trial or other suitably rigorous evaluation phase, and that unpromising work ceases. I
defaultf they do not progress from exploration to development to trial then they must 
defaultreport
default that their early work is unpromising, so as to discourage wasteful investment of time and money by others. Finding out what does not work is therefore, almost, as valuabl
defaulte as finding what works.

defaultResearchers must be independent of the interventions they are evaluating, and they must commission genuinely independent evaluations of any interventions they are developing.  They must care far more about getting the correct answ
defaulter to their research questions than about what that answer actually is. Almost as importantly, they must be more careful in describing and badging the kind of work they are currently conducting. They must eschew causal terms like ‘impact’ or ‘influence’ ex
defaultcept where their research designs permit or where the use is clearly speculative.

defaultSome of the generic problems with evaluation studies are quite alarming, and are nothing to do with those compromises sometimes necessary because of limited time, resources
default or data. Researchers are frequently quoting statistical significance and p-values with non-random samples not randomly allocated to groups, and this is as prevalent in supposedly peer-reviewed articles as in unpublished reports. And they are using the ‘si
defaultgnificance’ levels to try and decide whether an intervention has been effective or not. This is a widespread error, based on ignorance of sampling theory, 
defaultand it
default simply must cease. Researchers are also frequently presenting 
defaultsuch 
defaultanalyses based on individua
defaultl cases when they have allocated cases to treatment groups by classes, or even when there has been no allocation at all (such as when a matched comparator is created post hoc). A slightly less widespread but still important and dangerous 
defaultproblem
default is dredging for success. Many reports, even the better ones, are poorly written in the sense that they are vague or incomplete about basic facts such as numbers of cases, how they were selected and allocated and how much dropout or refusal there was. This
default may be carelessness. But some reports describe wider studies and several possible outcomes but only present the findings for outcomes that are deemed positive or desirable. This goes far beyond the possible file-drawer problem of unpublished negative find
defaultings. Authors themselves seem to want to bias the evidence base by cherry-picking their own results
default before publication
default. Nothing will improve until such frankly shoddy practices are prevented. This is a challenge for capacity-building, and one that is unadd
defaultressed by high profile programmes such as the UK ‘Quantitative Methods Initiative’ (which are mostly trying to widen the existing invalid practices in this area).

defaultIn some instances, the lack of efficacy of these interventions may have had more to do with the recruitment and retention of participants than the intervention itself. An intervention to involve parents more, by definition, can only work if the parents wis
defaulth to be involved. In fact, this difference in motivation could be the reason for the widely noted association between parental engagement and child attainment in the first place. Perhaps interventions will never be successful with the unwilling. Potential 
defaultbarriers to enhanced parental involvement include issues with 
defaultparent work schedule and lifestyle, lack of confidence in communicating with school, language, health problems, embarrassment about their own education, negative learner identities, inconsistent
default enthusiasm of teachers for the process, and a 
defaultgeneral lack of interest among some parents.

defaultFor 
defaultusers such as policy-makers and practitioners, 
defaultthe key message 
defaultfrom this review 
defaultis that although increasing parental involvement sounds pl
defaultausible, there is no solid evidence base for intervention yet, in most age groups and for most approaches. Where they are compared with parental involvement interventions, classroom interventions to achieve the same end currently have more evidence of effe
defaultctiveness

defaultThe most promising phase is pre-school and preparation for primary school. 
defaultThe most effective programme in this review, with long term results, and based on some of the best evaluations, mixes parental involvement with an array of other intervention elements. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude that the parental involvement
default element has been effective. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that this programme is based on providing institutional support for parents and bringing them into the care centres and early classrooms. It is not a home-based intervention. In fact, overall, t
defaulthe impression from the review is that interventions are most likely to succeed when they are aimed at young children, and involve parents and staff meeting regularly in an institution, with parental training, on-going support, and co-operative working with
default teachers.

defaultThere is very little evidence of promise from evaluations of parental interventions for children of later primary age, secondary age or across phases of schooling. Practical interventions here can be safely abandoned
default for the present
default, where the
default concern is chiefly with academic outcomes. Some specific kinds of intervention also have so little evidence of promise that they can be abandoned safely (if the concern is chiefly with academic outcomes). These include parents working on
default computers with th
defaulteir children. 
defaultThe remaining approaches can be classified into a number of broad groups. Simple parental participation in school events, like parents-teachers’ evening, or parents-teachers associations, cake sales and other fund-raising events, is untested.
default There is no reason to believe such behaviour will influence attainment for disadvantaged children. 
defaultP
defaultrogrammes that merely encourage parents to work with their children at home (i.e. without direct support or skills training), or seek to improve parent:chi
defaultld relationships
default appear to be ineffective
default. If neither the parent nor the child knows how to improve a skill like reading comprehension then mere aspiration or motivation is not going to help. Effective parental engagement is not just about getting parents 
defaultto be interested in their children’s education or 
defaultto help
default them with their school work. M
defaultany
default parents from all socio-economic backgrounds are already routinely helping with their children’s school work, with low income families just as likely 
defaultto be involved 
defaultas those from higher income homes. And such involvement does not significantly affect children’s performance. So, 
defaultmerely 
defaultincreasing parental involvement is not the answer in itself.
