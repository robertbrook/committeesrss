&#xa0;
[normal]Written evidence submitted by Scope[bold]1.1.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Scope remains 
[normal]concerned that the payment of the housing element of Universal Credit (UC) direct to 
[normal]tenants within their monthly payment will lead to increased arrears, and that changes to support for mortgage interest will equate to further cuts for disabled people.
[normal]1.2.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Impact assessments have shown that changes to the uprating of Housing Benefit 
[normal](HB) 
[normal]will 
[normal]entail huge losses for disabled people
[normal]1.3.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Penalties for under-occupancy in the social rented sector will have a grave impact on disabled people who either require extra space for needs relating to their disability, or are unable to move
[normal] house. 
[normal]1.4.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The cap on Annually Managed Expenditure (AME) will lead to inappropriate trade-offs between HB and disability benefits – meaning inevitable losses for disabled 
[normal]people.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Scope recommends that
[normal] the Government
[normal]:
[normal]1.4.1.
[normal] Put in place proper provisions to ensure disabled people do not risk falling into arrears because of changes through UC
[normal]1.4.2.
[normal] 
[normal]R
[normal]econsider the zero-earning
[normal]s rule, and make provisions in light of 
[normal]the barriers disabled people face in finding full-time employ
[normal]ment.
[normal]1.4.3. Make 
[normal]exemption
[normal]s
[normal] in regulations for disabled people living in specially adapted homes and those with legitimate reasons for being unable to move, or needing the extra space
[normal].
[normal]1.4.4
[normal] 
[normal]Put in place 
[normal]clear safeguards for disability benefits within the
[normal] AME
[normal] cap, so that disabled people’s incomes will have some protection against wider trends in the economy.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.1.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]We all want to live in a world of opportunity – to be able to live our own life, play our part and be valued for the person we are. At 
[normal]Scope we’re passionate about possibility.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] It inspires us every day and means we never set limits on people’s potential. We work with disabled people and their families at every stage of their lives.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] From offering day to day support and information, to ch
[normal]allenging assumptions about disability and influencing decision makers – everything we do is about creating real and lasting change. We believe that a world where all disabled people have the same opportunities as everyone else would be a pretty incredible
[normal] place for all of us. Together we can make it happen.

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.1
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]For m
[normal]ost households, UC 
[normal]will be paid a single monthly payment, with the housing element being directly paid to tenants as part of it. We remain concerned that this will have huge implications for disabled people
[normal] -
[normal] partly because they have
[normal] been in the dark 
[normal]about the changes affecting them
[normal] 
[normal](In 2012 almost half (45%) of all disabled people had never even heard of UC) 
[normal]– but largely because the change will affect the 
[normal]way those on extremely tight budgets will be required to manage their money
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The DWP has itself accepted that – even with the exceptions outlined in the Lo
[normal]cal Support Services framework
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]– the change from weekly to monthly welfare payments will increase the overall demand for advice.
[normal]  
[normal]4.3
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Housing associations 
[normal]have expressed concerns that 
[normal]tenants will
[normal] use the 
[normal]housing element 
[normal]of their U
[normal]C payment 
[normal]to meet more pressing financial needs, 
[normal]meaning they fall into arrears.
[normal] 
[normal]D
[normal]isabled people are experiencing 
[normal]considerable 
[normal]financial diff
[normal]iculties; Scope commissioned research 
[normal]showed that nearly half (49%) disabled people are relying on credit to pay for the basics in life such as clothing and food, and are three times as likely to turn to doorstep loans (10% compared to 3% non-disabled people).
[normal] Disabled people are also more vu
[normal]lnerable to financial shocks- 
[normal]over a third (37%) say they could not afford an unexpected – but necessary – expense of £500, compared to a quarter 
[normal]of non-disabled people (26%).
[normal] 
[normal]This problem is therefore likely to be 
[normal]more acute for disabled people. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]National Housing Federation believes that the removal of direct payment alone could see arrears rise by £320million across the sector – a 100% rise based on our estimates of total rent arrears (together with a further £100million of additional transaction 
[normal]costs).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Recommendation:[bold] 
[normal]Scope echoes the committee’s 
[normal]recommendation that the Government moves quickly to publish a clear
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]definition of "vulnerable" groups within Universal Credit for whom it will not be appropriate to include housing costs in their 
[normal]benefit payment. It also needs to establish a robust process for proactively identifying claimants who are struggling to manage their housing costs so that they can be properly assisted before they fall into arrears and face eviction.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.1.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Scope is concerned that the introduction of the zero-earnings rule for support for mortgage interest will disproportionately affect disabled people. The rule means that recipients will not receive any hel
[normal]p with mortgage costs if they are doing any paid work, no matter how few hours. 
[normal]In their response, the
[normal] G
[normal]overnment writes that “having a mortgage to pay provides a strong incentive for moving into full-time employment”
[normal] and that the rule will move people to “
[normal]re-consider their position with regard to the amount of work they do or the level of their housing costs
[normal]”.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Disabled people are more likely to be working in low-paid, short-term and part-time jobs
[normal]: 
[normal]The 
[normal]wage gap 
[normal]betw
[normal]een disabled and non-disabled people 
[normal]remains higher than £1 an hour
[normal]. Many disabled people want to work - 1 in 6 would like to work more hours compared with 1 in 10 non-disabled people
[normal]- but face numerous barriers to the labour market
[normal]. 
[normal]These barriers include 
[normal]housing; social care; other employment support; workplace culture such as employer perceptions; low confidence; difficulties accessing flexible working arrangements; fewer demonstrable skills, qualifications and experience than the w
[normal]ider population.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]B
[normal]ut for those who 
[normal]face barriers to working more hours, or entering 
[normal]full time employment, the incen
[normal]tives 
[normal]for disabled people with a mortgage 
[normal]are redundant, and will simp
[normal]ly 
[normal]mean 
[normal]more cuts to the support 
[normal]they 
[normal]receive.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Recommendation:[bold] 
[normal]Scope
[normal] urges the Government to reconsider the zero-earnings rule, and make provisions for the barriers disabled people face in finding full-time employment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]6.1
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Scope remains deeply concerned that the size 
[normal]criteria in the 
[normal]social rented sector are
[normal] 
[normal]disproportionately affect
[normal]ing
[normal] disabled people. 
[normal]Since 1 April 2013, working age renters in the social sector have had their Housing Benefit (HB) reduced if judged to have a spare room.
[normal] 
[normal]If they have 1 ‘spare’ room their HB is reduced 
[normal]by 14%, if they have two or more ‘spare’ rooms
[normal] their HB is reduced by 25%. Tenants are faced with two choices – move to a smaller property or find a way to make up the shortfall. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The majority of those affected are 
[normal]disabled people
[normal]. 
[normal]660 000 people in total
[normal] will be affected by the 
[normal]size criteria 
[normal]by 2015, losing between £624 and £1144 per year. 420 000 (63%) of those af
[normal]fected will be disabled people.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.3
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Many disabled people need an additional room for specialist equipment; or so that 
[normal]they can sleep separately 
[normal]from their partner
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.4
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]On top of this, moving house is not an option for many disabled people. 
[normal]Some 
[normal]with mental health conditions find the thou
[normal]ght of moving very distressing; those with certain physical impairments 
[normal]will find packing and moving house 
[normal]impossible, and hiring someone to help, too expensive
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.5
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Many 
[normal]disabled social housing tenants have been allocated their home on the basis of their needs, or have had adaptations made to improve accessibility
[normal].
[normal] With a lack of alternative accessible housing av
[normal]ailable, these disabled people will be forced to pay more rent
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.6
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]On 30th July 2013, 
[normal]in 
[normal]judicial reviews brought by ten hou
[normal]seholds against the bedroom tax, the high courts 
[normal]acknowledged that the Government is discriminating against disabled people
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.7
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The DWP
[normal] argues
[normal] that the £25 million in 
[normal]Discretionary Housing Payment (DHP)
[normal] would cover the loss in HB experienced by those in ‘exceptional circum
[normal]stances’. 
[normal]T
[normal]here is a 
[normal]danger that this cash-limited pot simply will not go far enough to 
[normal]support all those that need it. Local Authorities will only be given a limited amount of money from which to make 
[normal]these payments
[normal], and so will have to make difficult decisions a
[normal]bout who to provide with a DHP, and for how long.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]6.8
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Recommendation:[bold] 
[normal]There should be an exemption in regulations 
[normal]on the size criteria 
[normal]for disabled people living in specially adapted homes and those with legitimate reasons for 
[normal]being unable to move
[normal]. There should also be exemptions for
[normal] 
[normal]d
[normal]isabled couples who cannot share a bedro
[normal]om 
[normal]and s
[normal]tor
[normal]a
[normal]ge for bulky medical equipment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.1.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]S
[normal]cope is extremely worried about the Chancellor’s
[normal] announcement at the Spending Round that there will be a cap on the social security part of Annually Managed Expenditure - spending that the government has previously said could not be limited in advance, but now will be.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]State Pensions and JSA will be excluded from the cap, but disability benefits won’t be protected. Nor will 
[normal]HB 
[normal]which – like JSA - respond to changes in the economy.
[normal] 
[normal]The impact of this is that disabled people are left exposed to trade-offs within the cap. So
[normal] if one year the need for 
[normal]HB 
[normal]rises sharply, there is a real risk that disability benefits will be a lower spending priority.
[normal] T
[normal]here is a substantial risk disabled people will lose out on vital financial lifelines.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.3.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Recommendation:[bold] 
[normal]We therefore want to see c
[normal]lear safeguards for disability benefits within the cap, so that disabled people’s incomes will have some protection against wider trends in the economy.
