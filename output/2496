defaultWritten evidence submitted by Scopedefault1.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultScope remains 
defaultconcerned that the payment of the housing element of Universal Credit (UC) direct to 
defaulttenants within their monthly payment will lead to increased arrears, and that changes to support for mortgage interest will equate to further cuts for disabled people.

defaultImpact assessments have shown that changes to the uprating of Housing Benefit 
default(HB) 
defaultwill

default1.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultPenalties for under-occupancy in the social rented sector will have a grave impact on disabled people who either require extra space for needs relating to their disability, or are unable to move

default&#xa0; 
defaultThe cap on Annually Managed Expenditure (AME) will lead to inappropriate trade-offs between HB and disability benefits – meaning inevitable losses for disabled

default:
default1.4.1.
default Put in place proper provisions to ensure disabled people do not risk falling into arrears because of changes through UC
default1.4.2.

defaulteconsider the zero-earning

default.
default1.4.4
default 
defaultPut in place 
defaultclear safeguards for disability benefits within the

default cap, so that disabled people’s incomes will have some protection against wider trends in the economy.

defaultWe all want to live in a world of opportunity – to be able to live our own life, play our part and be valued for the person we are. At 
defaultScope we’re passionate about possibility.
default&#xa0;
default It inspires us every day and means we never set limits on people’s potential. We work with disabled people and their families at every stage of their lives.
default&#xa0;
default From offering day to day support and information, to ch

default place for all of us. Together we can make it happen.

default&#xa0;default4.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultFor m
defaultost households, UC 
defaultwill be paid a single monthly payment, with the housing element being directly paid to tenants as part of it. We remain concerned that this will have huge implications for disabled people
default -
default partly because they have
default been in the dark 
defaultabout the changes affecting them
default 
default(In 2012 almost half (45%) of all disabled people had never even heard of UC) 
default– but largely because the change will affect the 
defaultway those on extremely tight budgets will be required to manage their money
default. 
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe DWP has itself accepted that – even with the exceptions outlined in the Lo
defaultcal Support Services framework
default 
default 
default– the change from weekly to monthly welfare payments will increase the overall demand for advice.

defaultHousing associations

defaultof their U
defaultC payment 
defaultto meet more pressing financial needs, 
defaultmeaning they fall into arrears.
default 
defaultD
defaultisabled people are experiencing 
defaultconsiderable 
defaultfinancial diff
defaulticulties; Scope commissioned research 
defaultshowed that nearly half (49%) disabled people are relying on credit to pay for the basics in life such as clothing and food, and are three times as likely to turn to doorstep loans (10% compared to 3% non-disabled people).
default Disabled people are also more vu
defaultlnerable to financial shocks- 
defaultover a third (37%) say they could not afford an unexpected – but necessary – expense of £500, compared to a quarter 
defaultof non-disabled people (26%).
default 
defaultThis problem is therefore likely to be 
defaultmore acute for disabled people. 
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthe 
defaultNational Housing Federation believes that the removal of direct payment alone could see arrears rise by £320million across the sector – a 100% rise based on our estimates of total rent arrears (together with a further £100million of additional transaction 
defaultcosts).
default&#xa0;
default4.5
default&#xa0; 
defaultRecommendation:default 
defaultScope echoes the committee’s 
defaultrecommendation that the Government moves quickly to publish a clear
default&#xa0;
defaultdefinition of "vulnerable" groups within Universal Credit for whom it will not be appropriate to include housing costs in their 
defaultbenefit payment. It also needs to establish a robust process for proactively identifying claimants who are struggling to manage their housing costs so that they can be properly assisted before they fall into arrears and face eviction.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default5.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultScope is concerned that the introduction of the zero-earnings rule for support for mortgage interest will disproportionately affect disabled people. The rule means that recipients will not receive any hel
defaultp with mortgage costs if they are doing any paid work, no matter how few hours. 
defaultIn their response, the
default G
defaultovernment writes that “having a mortgage to pay provides a strong incentive for moving into full-time employment”
default and that the rule will move people to “
defaultre-consider their position with regard to the amount of work they do or the level of their housing costs
default”.
default&#xa0;
default5.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultDisabled people are more likely to be working in low-paid, short-term and part-time jobs
default: 
defaultThe 
defaultwage gap 
defaultbetw
defaulteen disabled and non-disabled people 
defaultremains higher than £1 an hour
default. Many disabled people want to work - 1 in 6 would like to work more hours compared with 1 in 10 non-disabled people
default- but face numerous barriers to the labour market
default. 
defaultThese barriers include 
defaulthousing; social care; other employment support; workplace culture such as employer perceptions; low confidence; difficulties accessing flexible working arrangements; fewer demonstrable skills, qualifications and experience than the w
defaultider population.
default&#xa0;
default5.3.

defaultut for those who 
defaultface barriers to working more hours, or entering 
defaultfull time employment, the incen
defaulttives 
defaultfor disabled people with a mortgage 
defaultare redundant, and will simp
defaultly 
defaultmean 
defaultmore cuts to the support 
defaultthey 
defaultreceive.
default&#xa0;
default5.4.
default&#xa0; 
defaultRecommendation:default 
defaultScope
default urges the Government to reconsider the zero-earnings rule, and make provisions for the barriers disabled people face in finding full-time employment.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default6.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultScope remains deeply concerned that the size 
defaultcriteria in the 
defaultsocial rented sector are
default 
defaultdisproportionately affect
defaulting
default disabled people. 
defaultSince 1 April 2013, working age renters in the social sector have had their Housing Benefit (HB) reduced if judged to have a spare room.
default 
defaultIf they have 1 ‘spare’ room their HB is reduced 
defaultby 14%, if they have two or more ‘spare’ rooms
default their HB is reduced by 25%. Tenants are faced with two choices – move to a smaller property or find a way to make up the shortfall. 
default&#xa0;
default6.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe majority of those affected are 
defaultdisabled people
default. 
default660 000 people in total
default will be affected by the 
defaultsize criteria 
defaultby 2015, losing between £624 and £1144 per year. 420 000 (63%) of those af
defaultfected will be disabled people.
default 
default&#xa0;
default6.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultMany disabled people need an additional room for specialist equipment; or so that 
defaultthey can sleep separately 
defaultfrom their partner
default.
default&#xa0;
default6.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultOn top of this, moving house is not an option for many disabled people. 
defaultSome 
defaultwith mental health conditions find the thou
defaultght of moving very distressing; those with certain physical impairments 
defaultwill find packing and moving house 
defaultimpossible, and hiring someone to help, too expensive
default.
default&#xa0;
default6.5
default&#xa0; 
defaultMany 
defaultdisabled social housing tenants have been allocated their home on the basis of their needs, or have had adaptations made to improve accessibility
default.
default With a lack of alternative accessible housing av
defaultailable, these disabled people will be forced to pay more rent
default.
default&#xa0;
default6.6
default&#xa0; 
defaultOn 30th July 2013, 
defaultin 
defaultjudicial reviews brought by ten hou
defaultseholds against the bedroom tax, the high courts 
defaultacknowledged that the Government is discriminating against disabled people
default.
default&#xa0;
default6.7
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe DWP
default argues
default that the £25 million in 
defaultDiscretionary Housing Payment (DHP)
default would cover the loss in HB experienced by those in ‘exceptional circum
defaultstances’. 
defaultT
defaulthere is a 
defaultdanger that this cash-limited pot simply will not go far enough to 
defaultsupport all those that need it. Local Authorities will only be given a limited amount of money from which to make 
defaultthese payments
default, and so will have to make difficult decisions a
defaultbout who to provide with a DHP, and for how long.
default&#xa0;default6.8
default&#xa0; 
defaultRecommendation:default 
defaultThere should be an exemption in regulations 
defaulton the size criteria 
defaultfor disabled people living in specially adapted homes and those with legitimate reasons for 
defaultbeing unable to move
default. There should also be exemptions for
default 
defaultd
defaultisabled couples who cannot share a bedro

default&#xa0;
default7.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultS
defaultcope is extremely worried about the Chancellor’s
default announcement at the Spending Round that there will be a cap on the social security part of Annually Managed Expenditure - spending that the government has previously said could not be limited in advance, but now will be.
default&#xa0;
default7.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultState Pensions and JSA will be excluded from the cap, but disability benefits won’t be protected. Nor will 
defaultHB 
defaultwhich – like JSA - respond to changes in the economy.
default 
defaultThe impact of this is that disabled people are left exposed to trade-offs within the cap. So
default if one year the need for 
defaultHB 
defaultrises sharply, there is a real risk that disability benefits will be a lower spending priority.
default T
defaulthere is a substantial risk disabled people will lose out on vital financial lifelines.
default&#xa0;
default7.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultRecommendation:default 
defaultWe therefore want to see c
defaultlear safeguards for disability benefits within the cap, so that disabled people’s incomes will have some protection against wider trends in the economy.
