"Written evidence from the Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists (LTC 44)Executive Summary&#xa0;The Society of\n Chiropodists and Podiatrists, \nthe professional body and trade union \nwhich represents over\n 10,000\n Chiropodists and P\nodiatrists, \nwishes to respond to your invitation to submit evidence to its inquiry into the man\nagement of long \nterm conditions.\n&#xa0;The Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists is well placed to comment on the treatmen\nt of long term care as it is\n, or should be, \nan integral part of the care pathway relating to the treatment of \na number of long term \nconditions\n. These range \nfrom Diabetes to Peripheral Arterial Disease and Rheumatoid Arthritis. Moreover its members, whether employed by the NHS or in private practice\n, work in a range of settings\n \n- \ncommunity and acute.\n&#xa0;\nThe Society found that \nthe current \nmix of service responsibilities\n does not always serve the patient best\n nor are services sufficiently well organised so that community and acute services are \nwell\n \nintegrated\n. For example those with d\niabetes often l\nack the availability of a multi\ndisciplinary \nfootcare\n team \n(MDFT) as o\nnly 45.5% of hospital sites currently have one\n. In terms o\nf\n \nevidenced \nbest practice each MDFT\n should be linked to a Foot Protection Team working in \nboth \nthe community\n and the acute sector\n. This \nlack of provision \nis \ndespite \nclear\n and accepted\n \nresearch showing \nthat \nthe \nintegration of these sectors\n generate\ns\n better patient outcomes and save\ns\n money\n (up to £\n3\n4m a year)\n. \nThe submission includes examples of effective integrated provision.\n&#xa0;\nSimilarly, people\n with Peripheral Arterial Disease \nare often not diagnosed in the early stage of disease progression- an early diagnosis could be made by a Podiatrist.\n Th\ne 10 year mortality for those with Peripheral Arterial Disease, at approximately 50%, is worse than those for other serious conditions such as breast cancer. \nHowever\n \nbetter assessment, diagnosis and management \nthrough \nthe provision of \nc\nommunity \nPodiatry\n and other\n \nservices\n would lead to \na \nreduced mortality rate and lead to\n more appropriate referrals to vascular clinics. \n&#xa0;\nSimilarly, despite NICE noting that all people with Rheumatoid Arthritis\n should have access to\n foot health services, only half of all rheumatology departments report basic foot \nhealth\n services for their patients and less than 1 in 10 have formal care pathways or mechanisms for referral to foot \nhealth \nservices. Better integrated NHS primary and acute care, including the provision of foot \northoses\n (insoles) which have the potential to prevent major functional and structural foot problems, would result in earlier diagnosis and better treatment resulting in estimated productivity gains to the economy of £31 million from reduced sick leave and lost employment.\n&#xa0;\nThe revised NHS Constitution’s first guiding principle declares that the NHS has a duty to promote equality through the \nservices it provides. \nThe Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists \ntherefore \nurges that full foot health\n services\n provision be extended throughout England rather than the current rolling back and cutting of services. Foot \nh\nealth \ns\nervices have a \nlarge \npart to play in improving the quality of life and longevity of an ageing population with long term conditions through their ability to diagnose and treat foot conditions, make tim\nely onward referrals and via\n the d\nelivery of health promotion advice\n to prevent symptoms.\n Despite providing guidance to commissioners\n, for example on best practice on \n‘Putting Feet First in Diabetes C\nare\n’\n for the attention of CCGs and Health &amp; Wellbeing Boards\n,\n the Society fears that the new NHS may lead to fragmentation and not better practice\n in treating those with long term conditions\n. \n&#xa0;Diabetes &#xa0;\n1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCurrently \n2.9 million people \n(4%) in the UK \nhave been diagnosed with d\niabetes\n. It is estimated that a further 850,000 are either undiagnosed or have no confirmed diagnosis\n.\n E\npidemiologists estimate that this figure will have increased to 5 million by 2025 and \nto \n10% of\n the whole population by 2032\n.\n2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe prevention and management of foot disease in people with diabetes is an essential component of every commissioned diabetes pathway. T\nhe ch\nallenge for the NHS is to ensure these services are in place and therefore reduce\n th\ne incidence of amputation\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n5-7%, (130,000-180,000) of people with diabetes will\n experience\n a foot ulcer at some stage in their lives\n.\n \nAt any single time there will be over 60,000 people\n in England\n with a foot ulcer.\n Evidence shows foot complications account for more hospital admissions than any other complication of diabetes\n; 500,000 hospital bed nights are taken up by foot complications\n per year\n. Moreover the mortality rate for \npeople with \ndiabetic foot ulcers is third only to pan\ncreatic and lung cancers at 5\n years\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nNational Diabetes Inpatient Audit (2012) found that 9.3% of patients had a foot complication on admission, of which 53.3% \nhad input from a multi\ndisciplinary foot team within 24 hours.\n \nThe audit found that \n1.6% of patients developed a foot lesion during their admission\n which was reduced from 2.2% in 2010\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe current number\n of amputations is\n rising from 5,700 in 2009/10 to over 6\n,\n000 in 2010/11. It is reported that \ngiven the increasing incidence of diabetes \nthere will be over 7\n,\n000 amputations \nperformed \no\nn people with d\niabetes in England by 2014/15, unless\n urgent action is taken\n.\n&#xa0;\n6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is currently \na\n high variability in incidence of lower limb amputation, both minor and major, evident across \ncommissioning organisations\n. For minor amputat\nions the variation is tenfold- \nfrom 0.3\n \nper thousand adults to 3.5, with an average of 1.4\n per thousand\n. For major amputations the range is from 0 to 1.8\n per thousand\n, with an average of 0.7 per thousand adults.\n \n&#xa0;\n7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nJeffcoate\n et al (2012) concluded that the 10-fold variation in amputation rates between \ncommissioning organisations\n in England related largely to the structure of available specialist services\n.\n It \nhas also been widely reported, \nand accepted by D\nepartment of Health Ministers, \nthat 80% \nof amputations are preventable.\n \n&#xa0;\n8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNICE clinical guideline 10 (2004) set out a \nfootcare\n management plan in order to reduce \nthe \nrisk of problems occurring in those with diabetes.\n \nSimilarly \nDiabetes UK\n put forward f\nour\n simple steps to reducing amputations\n:\n \n&#xa0;\n9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNHS D\niabetes and Diabetes UK commissioned the \nlandmark \npublication\n,\n \nFootc\nare\n for \nP\neople with Diabetes: T\nhe Economic Case for Change\n.\n \nIt h\nas\n calculated that the total expenditure withi\nn the NHS\n on diabetic foot care in 2011\n was\n between £\n573 and £686\n million. \nThis does not include the economic impact from disability payments, reduced tax revenues and re-housing. \n&#xa0;\n10.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nC\nl\near clinical evidence \nwas provided \nthat\n showed\n the importance of diagnostic tests, early referral to sp\necialist care, the use of multi\ndisciplinary teams and cardiovascular screening\n, a\nll of which can reduce amputation and mortality\n rates\n. \nNICE guidance\n Clini\ncal Guideline\n 119\n \nbacks this up by \nstating\n \nin its list of key priorities \nthat ‘ongoing care of an individual with an ulcerated foot should be undertaken without delay by a multidisciplinary foot care team.’\n&#xa0;\n11.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nE\nvidence \nwas cited \nfor\n a multidisciplinary foot c\nare team\n (MDFT)\n approach for \nin\npatients\n with diabetes in Southampton which led to a reduction in the length of inpatient stays from 50 days to 18 days. Not only were patient outcomes improved but annual savings to the NHS of £888,979 were \ngenerated. In another example, \nat \nThe \nJames\n Cook Hospital in Middlesb\nro\nugh\n, \na \nMDFT\n generated annual savings of £249,459. \nLikewise a\nn 11 year study at Ipswich Hospital found that the incidence of major amputation per\n 10,000 people with \ndiabetes fell by 82% following the introduction of an inpatient \nMDFT\n. The incidence of minor amputation per 10,000 people with diabetes fell by 21%.\n&#xa0;\n12.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nB\ny standardis\ning best practice multidisciplinary team working throughout the UK \nthe NHS could make net savings and reduce the number of amputations. \nMarion Kerr estimated, for example, \nth\nat \ni\nf there were\n a 50% reduction in amputations by 2018, the savings generated are calculated as £42million over the five year period from 2013.\n \nMeanwhil\ne the National Audit Office has\n estimated that a reduction of late referrals to specialist foot teams by 50% could save at least £34 million each year through the reduction of amputations\n.\n&#xa0;\n13.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe Society \nof Chiropodists and Podiatrists \nhas long had an on-going concern about whe\nther the issue of amputations, and consequent mortality, \nreceives the level of public attention it warrants given that the mortality rates for \npeople\n with diabetic \nfoot \nulcers and those having amputations are greater than those with breast or prostate cancer.\n \nBy\n prioritising best practice in long term conditions, as well as meeting t\nhe Nicholson Challenge\n, \nthere\n \nis \nan ideal opportunity to right this wrong. To do so would also be in line with two of the five outcomes for the NH\nS identified within the \n‘\nMandate for NHS \nEngland\n: preventing people from dying prematurely and enhancing quality of life for pe\nople with long term condit\nions\n’\n.\n Foot health services are \nstrug\ngling to manage current demand and \nthe predicted increase in \nthe \nprevalence of dia\nbetes will lead to overload- consequently \na workforce review is urgently required.\n&#xa0;Peripheral Arterial Disease &#xa0;\n14.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPeripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) is common in the UK population \nin\n those aged 55 or over\n, but is \noften not\n \ndiagnosed\n until it is moderate or severe\n. Outcomes have been poor, with substantial cardiovascular mortality and morbidity and, to a lesser degree, chronic lower limb wounds and amputation\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n15.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPAD \nhas recently been included in \nNICE\n guidance\n (2012)\n and Quality and Outcomes Framework indicators\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n16.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFox (2013)\n postulated that with\n better assessment, diagnosis and management of PAD in community services\n, there\n \ncould be \nfewer, but more appropriate\n referrals to vascular clinics.\n \nThis\n could in turn\n free up surgical appointment slots to allow rapid access for people with critical limb \nischaemia\n, thus unlocking improvement at no significant additional cost.\n&#xa0;\n17.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPAD’s 10 year mortality, at approximately 50%, is worse than those for other serious conditions such as breast cancer and malignant melanoma of the foot. This may be due to a lack of early diagnosis\n \nand effective clinical management\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n18.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs up to 50% of those with PAD are asymptomatic \nit \nis important that those with risk factors are screened early to enable l\nifestyle changes to take place, t\nhus enabling\n a reduction in\n h\nospital admissions, amputations and premature death\n;\n and\n \nimprovement\ns\n in\n quality of life and life expectancy.\n \nPodiatrists are able to diagn\nose PAD and \nenable onward v\nascular referral.\n&#xa0;Rheumatoid Arthritis &#xa0;19.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRheumatoid A\nrthritis is a chronic inflammatory joint diso\nrder that affects approximately\n 580,000 people in England, wh\nich suggests that over 690,000 people\n in the UK live with the condition.\n Females are \nup to \nfour\n times more likely to develop the condition than men. \nUp to 90% of people with Rheumatoid A\nrthritis have some form of disease related foot involvement. Long standing inflammation leads to structural deformity and soft tissue lesions, which in turn generates areas of pressure that\n may result in foot ulceration.\n&#xa0;\n20.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNICE (2009)\n and Scottish Intercollegiate \nGuidelines \nNetwork (2011)\n concurred that a\nll people with \nRheumatoid A\nrthritis\n should have access to\n \nfoot health services\n. Yet only half of all rheumatology departments report basic foot care services for their patients and less than 1 in 10 have formal care pathways or mechanisms for\n referral to foot care services.\n \n&#xa0;\n21.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe National Audit Offic\ne’s report, Integration Across G\novernment,\n \nstated that b\netter integrated NHS primary and acute care would result in earlier diagnosis and treatment of patients with the \nRheumatoid Arthritis\n, ultimately resulting in productivity gains to the economy of £31 million from reduced sick leave and lost employment.\n&#xa0;\n22.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Podiatry Rheumatic Care Association\n recommended that early intervention through the provision of foot \northoses\n (insoles) \nhas the potential to prevent major functional and structural foot \nproblems\n providing joint mobility is still good\n. They cit\ned studies which demonstrated \nthat \nth\nrough the\n intervention of foot \northoses\n,\n a sustained effect is had on the foot structure and stability of the joints of the foot, thus reducing pain and improving mobility. \n&#xa0;\n23.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is potential to prevent major functional and structural foot problems by providing foot \northoses\n early on in the disease process. However, \nbecause f\noot changes have the potential to occur within 2 years of disease onset it is essential that patients are referred for assessment of foot function as early as possible following diagnosis.\n \nSimilarly NICE guidance\n recommended that\n f\nunctional insoles and therapeutic footwear should be available for all people with \nrheumatoid arthritis\n if indicated.\nMay 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n Figure based on data from AHPO diabetes prevalence model figures http://bit.ly/aphodiabetes and the QOF 2010 figures http://bit.ly/prevalence2010\n State of the Nation 2012 England, Diabetes UK\n \nFootc\nare\n for People with Diabetes - The Economic Case for Change, Kerr, M., \n2012. \nInsight Health Economics.
