default effective.
default1.4 Disability disaggregated data is nee

default,
default in order to plan appropriately
default and 
defaultmeasure inclusion.
default 
default1.5 Disability is not just a medical or physical issue. Strategies must also address the social, psychological and legal issues around disability, including addr
defaultessing stigma through a combination of individual 
defaultempowerment
default and community awareness.
default1.6
default Disability strategies, as well as 
defaultaddress
defaulting the consequences of disability, 
defaultshould consider 
defaultprevention of
default disability, including the treatment of neglected tropical diseases 
default(NTDs) 
defaultthat cause disability, such as leprosy.
default 
default1.8 Inequalities intersect, so people with disabilities can also be marginalised due to gender, caste, ethnicity, location, etc. 
defaultMainstreami
defaultng is important, with programmes 
defaultfocus
defaulting
default on the person rather than 
defaultjust 
defaultthe disability.
default1.8 DFID has begun to recognise the need for disability inclusion but much more needs to be done to ensure the rights of people with disabilities are realised. This sh

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default2.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Leprosy Mission, established in 1874, is an international development org
defaultanisation working in 11 leprosy-
defaultendemic countries to defeat leprosy and transform the lives of people affected by the disease.  It uses a holistic approach 
defaultto development that addresses not only the medical aspects of leprosy and disability but promotes so
defaultcial inclusion of those who have been stigmatised and disabled, supporting them to realise their human rights and live in dignity.
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultTLMEW 
defaultap
defaultpreciates the initial steps
default 
defaultDFID
default has taken towards the inclusion of people with d
defaultisabilities
default, including the ‘

default and other guidance documents

default&#xa0; 
defaultTLMEW is

default:

defaultA
defaultlthough 
defaultDFID has made a good start
default, 
defaultmuch 
defaultmore 
defaultmust be

default to 
defaultensure people with disabilities are not left behind in the development process and to

default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.1
default 
defaultPeople with disabilities
default comprise some of the 
defaultworld’s 
defaultmost marginalised and vulnerable people
default. A
defaultccording to
default 
defaultthe 
defaultWHO ‘people with 
defaultdisabilities and their families are more likely to experience economic and social disadvantage than those without disability’.
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default 
defaultIt is not sufficient for development programmes to target the easiest to reach. I
defaultn order to effectively address poverty
default,
default 
defaultDFID-
defaultsupported programmes (including Bilateral and Multilateral Aid) must
default target the poorest-of-the-poor
default.
default It
default 
defaultcan
default be argued that without involvement
default of people with disabilities
default,
default poverty alleviation measures will not achieve
default 
defaultfull success:
default f
defaultor ‘
defaultpeople with a disability are less likely to attend school, more likely to be unemployed, while 
defaulth
defaultouseholds with a disabled member are more likely to experience material hardship – including food insecurity, poor housing, lack of access to safe water and san
defaultitation, and 
defaultinadequate access to health care
default’, affecting a wide range of development indicators.
default  
default 
default&#xa0;default3.3
default 
defaultOn
default the whole most conv
defaultentional development programmes
default do not by defaul
defaultt include people with disabilities
default. This is 
defaultnot
default necessary due to
default their impairment or functional limitation. Inadequate policies, negative attitudes and lack of accessibility oft
defaulten prohibit their participation
default.
default 
default&#xa0;default3.4
default 
defaultThe WHO World Report on Disability (2011) calls for inclusion of people with disabilities in mainstream pro
defaultgrammes: ‘
defaultPeople with disabilities have ordinary needs – for health and well-being, for economic and social security, to learn and develop skills, and to live in their communities. These needs can and should be met in mainstream programmes and services. Ma
defaultinstreaming not only 
defaultfulfils
default the human rights of persons with disabili
defaultties, it is also more effective’
default.
default 
default 
default 
default&#xa0;default3.5
default 
defaultD
defaultespite there being international recognition that a key factor in preventing the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is the lack of inclusion of 
defaultpeople with disabilities
default,
default 
defaultt
defaulthere is currently no DFID polic
defaulty 
defaultn
defaultor strategy on disability. Thu
defaults
default there is no obligation for DFID programmes to demonstrate or monitor the inclusion of disabled people
default. Therefore
default, disability is not adequately reflected within strategic documents in other areas, such as the Strategic Vision for Women and Girls. Neither is there a requirement that Bilateral 
defaultn
defaultor Multilateral Aid is inclusive of people with disabilities.
default&#xa0;default3.6
default 
defaultEven when di
defaultsability is said to
default be ‘mainstreamed’ in some DFID-
defaultsupported projects there is evidence
default that this has
default not necessarily 
defaultbeen 
defaultwell implemented
default. For example,
default the 
defaultDFID Char Livelihoods Project in Bangladesh
default,
default where alth
defaultough ‘disability’ was a criterion
default for selection,
default because
default people with disabilities
default were not specifically encouraged 
defaultn
defaultor enabled to participate in the programme their involvement was limited
default,
default with only 3.3% of participants having a disability
default. 
defaultYet
default prevalence of disability in Bangladesh was
default 31.9%
default and as global proportions of disability are estimated to 
defaultaverage between 15% -20% of the 
defaultpopulation
default  they 
defaultwere
default significantly under-represented. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.1
default 
defaultFrom 2009
default-
default13 
defaultTLMEW was part of a consortium impl
defaultementing a large European Union funded programme: the Gaibandha Food 
defaultSecurity Project f
defaultor Ultra Poor Women (GFSUP)
default (see Annex 1)
default.
default defaultThe GFSUP was implemented in order to improve the food security situation of 40,
default000 women-
defaulth
defaulteaded households. W
defaultomen were

defaulted in
default 1
default,
default600 women

default groups, and these in turn formed federations. 
defaultW
defaultomen received training and assets to develop two inco

default 
defaultfurther 
defaulttraining on homestead gardens, health and hygiene, disaster preparedness, 
defaultand 
defaulton how to

defaultPeople with d

defaultwith
default 
defaultsupport from 
defaulta dedicated ‘
defaultdisability and leprosy team
default’ that
default provid
defaulted health education 
defaultand
default rehabilitation services to beneficiaries and
default family members with a disability
default.
default T
defaulthis twin 
default-
defaulttrack approach involved
default mainstreaming and disability-
defaultspecific inputs.
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default 
defaultThis intentionality in terms of inclusion led to 9.5% of direct 
defaultbeneficiarie
defaults being a person with disabilities
default and 21.4% of households of beneficiaries containing a person with disability, 
defaultall of 
defaultwhom received various support serv
defaultices. This figure compares 
defaultwell to global estimates of the propor

defaultdisab

default 
defaultand
default 
defaultfar surpasses 
defaultthe prop
defaultortion of people with disabilities
default included in the 
defaultDFID 
defaultChar Livelihoods Project which operated in adjacent sub-districts to the GFSUP.
default&#xa0;default4.3
default 
defaultThis 
defaultis

default‘active’ mainstreaming

defaultexpertise

default.
default Often ‘mainstreaming’ can be merely a sensitisation which exists on paper but gets lost

defaultactive focus on disability inclusion

defaultemphasised that disability mu
defaultst be considered 
defaultin 
defaultthe project design phase if 
defaultinclusion of people with 
defaultdisability and/or leprosy is to be effective.
default 
default 
default&#xa0;default4.5
default 
defaultIn 
defaultorder to 
defaultplan for ‘mainstreaming’
default it is essential 
defaultthat the needs assessment process involves actively seeking out people with disabilities, who in many cultures are often hidden away, explores their needs and involves them in 
defaultthe 
defaultproject design
default process
default.  
default&#xa0;default4.6
default 
defaultT
defaulto assess the effectiveness of ‘mainstreaming’
default,
default sufficient baseline data and actively track
defaulting
default the engagement of people with disabilities in the intervention
default is paramount
default.  Monitoring and evaluation with regard to disability inclusion should be both quantitative, the number of people with disabilities 
defaultbenefiting from the programme, but also qualitative, reflecting their level of participation in project activities as well as the most significant changes 
defaultseen
default in their lives as a result of the intervention.
default&#xa0;default4.7
default 
defaultInc
defaultlusion of people with disabilities
default is not as
default expensive as often imagined
default. For example
default,
default 
defaultwithin the GFSUP 
defaultproject 
defaultbudget, 
defaultprov
defaultision for people with disabilities
default totalled 
defaultjust 
default6% of project costs
default even though 
defaultthere were many disability-
defaultspecific services

defaultmoney in
default reaching the most marginalised
default and enabling them to contribute to the local economy.

defaultainstr
defaulteaming of people with disabilities

default,

default,

defaultand abilities. T
defaultheir leprosy/
defaultdisability 
defaultthen 
defaultbecame 
defaultmuch less significant in terms of their status, with many being voted into positions of responsibility within the groups and community.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.1
default 
defaultDisability strategies and programmes 
defaultmust
default recognise that disab
defaultility is not just 
defaulta 
defaultmedical
default condition
default. There are significant s
defaultocial impacts of disability
default that must be addressed.
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default 
defaultIn many cultures there is shame associated with disability resulting in people with disabilities being hidden away
default,
default prevented from engaging in their community and being denied their rights.  People 
defaultaffected by
default leprosy often are scared to admit their condition, or even 
defaultto 
defaultseek treatment
default,
default because of the stigma and social exclusion that often accompanies diagnosis. Many p
defaulteople try to hide their disability in order to retain social acceptance. (Annex 2)
default&#xa0;default5.3
default 
defaultWhen people experience clawed hands
default due to leprosy
default, not only are they unable to grip things, they ar
defaulte also unable to greet people
default. A simple 
defaultIndian 
defaultgesture of greeting 
default‘namaste’
default 
defaulthighlights not only their disability but often triggers a deeply rooted fea
defaultr of a disease 
defaultthat 
defaultleads to stigma and discrimination. 
defaultAs a result
default, people affected by leprosy often withdraw from social interaction. Barriers to 
defaultinclusion are not only 
defaultphysical, but also social and psychosocial
default;
default 
defaultissues of stigma and discrimination
default 
defaultneed to be addressed.  
default&#xa0;default5.4
default 
defaultWork
defaulting
default with the individual to build confidence and 
defaultrights
default-awareness
default,
default as well as work
defaulting
default with the wider community to promote understanding and support is vital
default. 
defaultFor example, in
default the TLMEW-
defaultsupported 
defaultM
defaultIRANDA
default project in Myanmar
default,
default Disability Resource Centres are providing physiotherapy service
defaults
default to people with disabilities, 
defaultas well as

defaultestablished

defaultrun
default community awareness programmes on disability.  
defaultThese activities have resulted in p
defaulteople with disabilities 
defaultbecame more valued and
default 
defaultincluded in 
defaultsociety
default 
defaultand 
defaultthe whole community has
default benefited from more accessible raised pathways that are wheelchair accessible

defaultno longer have

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default6.1
default 
defaultAlthough it is essential to address the rights of persons with disabilities, it should be recognised that some people experience disability that could 
defaultbe
default prevented. M
defaultinimisation of the cau
defaultses of disability is paramount (see Annex 4).
default&#xa0;
default6.2
default 
defaultNeglected Tropical Diseases 
default(NTDs) 
defaultsuch as 
defaultLeprosy, Lymphatic 
defaultFilariasis
default and Trachoma 
defaultare a significant cause of serious disability worldwide 
defaultrepresenting
default high levels of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYS - the sum of the potential life lost due to pr
defaultemature mortality and the years of productive life lost due to disability)
default. These treatable diseases 
defaultmust be addressed in order to prevent people developing disabilities
default. Thus,
default DFID’s approach to NTDs should be li
defaultnked to its disability strategy.
default&#xa0;default6.3
default 
defaultA
defaultddressing NTDs is not just about mass drug administration. For many of those who have received late diagnosis and treatment
default,
default 
defaultdisability is already a result.
default For some the disability is obvious. Others, including 
defaultpeople
default affected by leprosy
default, 
defaultmay not have a vi
defaultsual disability
default but like those with diabetes
default the sensation loss they experience
default is 
defaultdisabling
default.
default  
defaultP

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default7.1
default 
defaultInequalities intersect
default,
default so a person with

defaultafter

defaultor after contracting a disease
default,
default resulting in disability.
default&#xa0;default7.3
default 
defaultIt is notable that the risk of disability occurring is heightene

default,
default and further marginalisation is more likely 
defaultto occur
default due to disability. 
default defaultThis therefore leads to

defaultAnndefaultex 2default – Case StudydefaultJahiruddin, IndiadefaultJahiruddin Kahan is 
defaultmarried with two children and two grandchildren. He has a small stationers shop on the edge of Kolkata. Twenty years ago, when he was 41 years old, he fell from a minibus and a stone went inside his leg. The ulcer that developed would not heal and he spent
default over 10 years going to different hospitals and doctors to get help. One 
defaultdoctor gave him medicine to which his body seemed to react and he became covered with boils.  He went to a skin specialist who referred him to an expert in tropical medicine.  It was 
defaultthere that leprosy was eventually diagnosed, he was given MDT and eventually the ulcer healed.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, 10 years without a diagnosis took its toll on his feet and nerve damage was evident. In 2003 he developed another ulcer and came to TLM’s Hospital.  Here doctors recognised that he had been given the wrong dose of MDT originally so he was given a 
defaultnew treatment regime, his leg was put in plaster to help his ulcer to heal and he returned home, coming back to the hospital every 15 days for a check-up and the rest of his treatment.  However, he never told anyone that he had leprosy. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFour months ago h
defaulte injured his toe and so he returned to the place where he had received loving care.  However, the severity of his wound meant that he needed a skin graft and a month of bed rest.  During this time, Kavita, a hospital volunteer, has been encouraging people
default to learn to read and write.  Jahiruddin was already literate and could write well in Bengali, so he decided to use his time in bed to write a story.  During my visit he proudly read what he had written, a story about a man, magic and a mango tree, a story
default with a clear moral message of the need to obey your master and the importance of honesty.
default&#xa0;
defaultYet this talented man also expressed that he is frightened that when he returns home people will be suspicious of the causes of his problem since he has been away h
defaultaving treatment for so long.  He is worried that if they guess his disability is due to leprosy that he will be excluded by the local community of which he is a part.  As for his dreams, he said, “I want people to understand that leprosy is curable and not
default a curse, I want to return to my community as a businessman, not an untouchable. Don’t let them call me a ‘leper’.”

default defaultis
default default67 years old and is married with seven children.  27 years ago he developed leprosy but 
defaultwaited for 7 years before accessing treatment, by which time the disease had attacked his nerves and he had permanent disability. However, it was not just his physical disability, cause by his clawed hands and loss 
defaultof digits, which affected his life.  More
default painful than the physical impairment was the social stigma he experienced. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultKan was rejected by his community and not allowed to attend social functions such as weddings or Buddhist festivals. He was looked down upon with distain and his friends desert
defaulted him.  He faced such rejection and despair that he tried to commit suicide twice, the first by taking tablets and then by hanging.  Eventually his family chained him up to prevent his suicide attempts.  The stigma, discrimination and isolation all got to
defaulto much for Kan and he decided to move out of the village he had called home to go and live with his grandchildren.  
default&#xa0;
defaultIt was here that he came in contact with The Leprosy Mission. Staff provided him with psychosocial support and worked with the community t
defaulto raise awareness about leprosy and disability, working with them to help reintegrate Kan back into the community. It has been a long process, but he is now accepted in his village and can join in celebrations and community events without being shunned.  H
defaulte is treated just like anyone else and now has the joys of watching his grandchildren growing up without being isolated from community life.

defaultAnnex 4 – Case study Nafisa, Nigeriadefault&#xa0;
defaultNafisa Aminou, 20, is from Nigeria and was told, aged 14, she had 
defaultleprosy and was advised to go to hospital for treatment. But instead she was given traditional herbal treatment for five years. If she was given multidrug therapy at an early stage, it would have been highly unlikely that she would have become disabled.
default&#xa0;
defaultE
defaultighteen months ago she developed painful ulcers on her legs and hearing of the reputation of The Leprosy Mission's services run from Danja Hospital, she and her mother crossed the border to Niger. On arrival from Nigeria, Nafisa had seriously shortened lim
defaultbs as a result of her untreated leprosy and her legs were too painful to be touched below the knees. She was given multidrug therapy to treat the disease and her legs were bandaged to in attempt to remove the swelling and some of the pain.
default&#xa0;
defaultWheelchair-bound, she began physiotherapy sessions to improve her mobility. Her legs were put in a plaster cast to straighten them and Boehler irons were attached to the plaster casts for walking. She is now able to walk with the help of a walking frame bu
defaultt she is still awaiting surgery on her lower legs which will further increase her independence.
default&#xa0;
defaultDespite her disabilities Nafisa is hugely grateful for the medical treatment and love she has received at Danja Hospital. She is optimistic that her mobility w
defaultill continue to improve and she dreams of marrying and having children.
