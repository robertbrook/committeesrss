[normal]Evidence from The Leprosy Mission, England &amp; Wales (TLMEW)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.
[normal]1 
[normal]People with disabilities 
[normal]are among the poorest of the poor but 
[normal]have not been adequately included in 
[normal]development or 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]MDGs
[normal];
[normal] this must be rectified in any post-2015 development framework which should include clear indicators 
[normal]to measure
[normal] disability inclusion
[normal].
[normal] This is a critical moment for DFID to 
[normal]take a leadership role 
[normal]in 
[normal]champion
[normal]ing
[normal] disability in post-2015 discussions.
[normal]1.
[normal]2
[normal] Mainstreaming people with disabilities into development programmes can be effective if it actively includes people with disabilities in the planning process. 
[normal]A
[normal] conso
[normal]rtium approach, 
[normal]where at least one 
[normal]partner is able to provide expertise in disability
[normal] is an effective model
[normal]. 
[normal]1.3
[normal] 
[normal]Programmes that use a twin-track approach – mainstreaming 
[normal]accompanied by
[normal] disability-
[normal]specific interventions – are 
[normal]particularly
[normal] effective.
[normal]1.4 Disability disaggregated data is nee
[normal]ded at national but also project level
[normal],
[normal] in order to plan appropriately
[normal] and 
[normal]measure inclusion.
[normal] 
[normal]1.5 Disability is not just a medical or physical issue. Strategies must also address the social, psychological and legal issues around disability, including addr
[normal]essing stigma through a combination of individual 
[normal]empowerment
[normal] and community awareness.
[normal]1.6
[normal] Disability strategies, as well as 
[normal]address
[normal]ing the consequences of disability, 
[normal]should consider 
[normal]prevention of
[normal] disability, including the treatment of neglected tropical diseases 
[normal](NTDs) 
[normal]that cause disability, such as leprosy.
[normal] 
[normal]1.8 Inequalities intersect, so people with disabilities can also be marginalised due to gender, caste, ethnicity, location, etc. 
[normal]Mainstreami
[normal]ng is important, with programmes 
[normal]focus
[normal]ing
[normal] on the person rather than 
[normal]just 
[normal]the disability.
[normal]1.8 DFID has begun to recognise the need for disability inclusion but much more needs to be done to ensure the rights of people with disabilities are realised. This sh
[normal]ould include:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.1
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Leprosy Mission, established in 1874, is an international development org
[normal]anisation working in 11 leprosy-
[normal]endemic countries to defeat leprosy and transform the lives of people affected by the disease.  It uses a holistic approach 
[normal]to development that addresses not only the medical aspects of leprosy and disability but promotes so
[normal]cial inclusion of those who have been stigmatised and disabled, supporting them to realise their human rights and live in dignity.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]TLMEW 
[normal]ap
[normal]preciates the initial steps
[normal] 
[normal]DFID
[normal] has taken towards the inclusion of people with d
[normal]isabilities
[normal], including the ‘
[normal]How to 
[normal]Note on Working on Disability in Country Programmes
[normal]’
[normal] and other guidance documents
[normal].
[normal] [bold] 
[normal]TLMEW also commend
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]Lynne Featherstone MP’s
[normal] recent signing of the 
[normal]Manhattan Declaration on the Inclus
[normal]ion of People with Disabilities and her announcement that schools built
[normal] with DFID funding will be accessible
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]TLMEW is 
[normal]currently 
[normal]receiving
[normal] support from DFID for 
[normal]two
[normal] projects that seek to meet the needs of people affected by leprosy and disability
[normal]:
[normal] [bold]Challenging Anti-Leprosy Legislation
[normal] that is facilitating people affected by leprosy to unite and advocate for their equal rights and entitlements at local, state and national level; and 
[normal]Reducing the physical and social barriers faced by 2,000 people with disabilities in seven States and Reg
[normal]ions in Myanmar and improving their livelihood opportunities
[normal] which 
[normal]facilitate
[normal]s
[normal] empl
[normal]oyment of people with disabilities
[normal] through small business creation, as well as working with 
[normal]the private sector
[normal] and government to ensure their inclusion in the workplace.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]A
[normal]lthough 
[normal]DFID has made a good start
[normal], 
[normal]much 
[normal]more 
[normal]must be
[normal] done
[normal] to 
[normal]ensure people with disabilities are not left behind in the development process and to 
[normal]meet the UK’s obligations 
[normal]under
[normal] Article 32
[normal] of the UN Convention on the Rights of P
[normal]ersons
[normal] with Disabilities 
[normal](UNCRPD) 
[normal]with regard to International C
[normal]ooperation.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal] 
[normal]People with disabilities
[normal] comprise some of the 
[normal]world’s 
[normal]most marginalised and vulnerable people
[normal]. A
[normal]ccording to
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]WHO ‘people with 
[normal]disabilities and their families are more likely to experience economic and social disadvantage than those without disability’.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal] 
[normal]It is not sufficient for development programmes to target the easiest to reach. I
[normal]n order to effectively address poverty
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]DFID-
[normal]supported programmes (including Bilateral and Multilateral Aid) must
[normal] target the poorest-of-the-poor
[normal].
[normal] It
[normal] 
[normal]can
[normal] be argued that without involvement
[normal] of people with disabilities
[normal],
[normal] poverty alleviation measures will not achieve
[normal] 
[normal]full success:
[normal] f
[normal]or ‘
[normal]people with a disability are less likely to attend school, more likely to be unemployed, while 
[normal]h
[normal]ouseholds with a disabled member are more likely to experience material hardship – including food insecurity, poor housing, lack of access to safe water and san
[normal]itation, and 
[normal]inadequate access to health care
[normal]’, affecting a wide range of development indicators.
[normal]  
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.3
[normal] 
[normal]On
[normal] the whole most conv
[normal]entional development programmes
[normal] do not by defaul
[normal]t include people with disabilities
[normal]. This is 
[normal]not
[normal] necessary due to
[normal] their impairment or functional limitation. Inadequate policies, negative attitudes and lack of accessibility oft
[normal]en prohibit their participation
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.4
[normal] 
[normal]The WHO World Report on Disability (2011) calls for inclusion of people with disabilities in mainstream pro
[normal]grammes: ‘
[normal]People with disabilities have ordinary needs – for health and well-being, for economic and social security, to learn and develop skills, and to live in their communities. These needs can and should be met in mainstream programmes and services. Ma
[normal]instreaming not only 
[normal]fulfils
[normal] the human rights of persons with disabili
[normal]ties, it is also more effective’
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.5
[normal] 
[normal]D
[normal]espite there being international recognition that a key factor in preventing the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is the lack of inclusion of 
[normal]people with disabilities
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]t
[normal]here is currently no DFID polic
[normal]y 
[normal]n
[normal]or strategy on disability. Thu
[normal]s
[normal] there is no obligation for DFID programmes to demonstrate or monitor the inclusion of disabled people
[normal]. Therefore
[normal], disability is not adequately reflected within strategic documents in other areas, such as the Strategic Vision for Women and Girls. Neither is there a requirement that Bilateral 
[normal]n
[normal]or Multilateral Aid is inclusive of people with disabilities.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.6
[normal] 
[normal]Even when di
[normal]sability is said to
[normal] be ‘mainstreamed’ in some DFID-
[normal]supported projects there is evidence
[normal] that this has
[normal] not necessarily 
[normal]been 
[normal]well implemented
[normal]. For example,
[normal] the 
[normal]DFID Char Livelihoods Project in Bangladesh
[normal],
[normal] where alth
[normal]ough ‘disability’ was a criterion
[normal] for selection,
[normal] because
[normal] people with disabilities
[normal] were not specifically encouraged 
[normal]n
[normal]or enabled to participate in the programme their involvement was limited
[normal],
[normal] with only 3.3% of participants having a disability
[normal]. 
[normal]Yet
[normal] prevalence of disability in Bangladesh was
[normal] 31.9%
[normal] and as global proportions of disability are estimated to 
[normal]average between 15% -20% of the 
[normal]population
[normal]  they 
[normal]were
[normal] significantly under-represented. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1
[normal] 
[normal]From 2009
[normal]-
[normal]13 
[normal]TLMEW was part of a consortium impl
[normal]ementing a large European Union funded programme: the Gaibandha Food 
[normal]Security Project f
[normal]or Ultra Poor Women (GFSUP)
[normal] (see Annex 1)
[normal].
[normal] [bold]The GFSUP was implemented in order to improve the food security situation of 40,
[normal]000 women-
[normal]h
[normal]eaded households. W
[normal]omen were
[normal] organis
[normal]ed in
[normal] 1
[normal],
[normal]600 women
[normal]’s
[normal] groups, and these in turn formed federations. 
[normal]W
[normal]omen received training and assets to develop two inco
[normal]me generating activities (IGAs) along with
[normal] 
[normal]further 
[normal]training on homestead gardens, health and hygiene, disaster preparedness, 
[normal]and 
[normal]on how to 
[normal]access 
[normal]government benefits
[normal]. 
[normal]People with d
[normal]isabilities
[normal] were intentionally included in this project 
[normal]with
[normal] 
[normal]support from 
[normal]a dedicated ‘
[normal]disability and leprosy team
[normal]’ that
[normal] provid
[normal]ed health education 
[normal]and
[normal] rehabilitation services to beneficiaries and
[normal] family members with a disability
[normal].
[normal] T
[normal]his twin 
[normal]-
[normal]track approach involved
[normal] mainstreaming and disability-
[normal]specific inputs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal] 
[normal]This intentionality in terms of inclusion led to 9.5% of direct 
[normal]beneficiarie
[normal]s being a person with disabilities
[normal] and 21.4% of households of beneficiaries containing a person with disability, 
[normal]all of 
[normal]whom received various support serv
[normal]ices. This figure compares 
[normal]well to global estimates of the propor
[normal]tion of people with 
[normal]disab
[normal]ilities
[normal] 
[normal]and
[normal] 
[normal]far surpasses 
[normal]the prop
[normal]ortion of people with disabilities
[normal] included in the 
[normal]DFID 
[normal]Char Livelihoods Project which operated in adjacent sub-districts to the GFSUP.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.3
[normal] 
[normal]This 
[normal]is
[normal] a good example of 
[normal]‘active’ mainstreaming
[normal] where
[normal] 
[normal]two international partners (Light for the World and TLMEW) and two of the 
[normal]consortium implementing pa
[normal]rtners C
[normal]entre for 
[normal]D
[normal]isability in
[normal] 
[normal]D
[normal]evelopment (CDD)
[normal] &amp; 
[normal]The Leprosy Mission Bangladesh (
[normal]TLMB
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]had
[normal] a
[normal] 
[normal]disability 
[normal]focus
[normal]. They
[normal] 
[normal]raised the knowledge of 
[normal]mainstream NG
[normal]O 
[normal]consortium partners on disability inclusion and 
[normal]kept the
[normal] issue on the agenda. They also provided
[normal] 
[normal]technical 
[normal]expertise
[normal] for implementation
[normal] and 
[normal]trained
[normal] 
[normal]implementing partner staff
[normal].
[normal] Often ‘mainstreaming’ can be merely a sensitisation which exists on paper but gets lost
[normal] in project implementation. T
[normal]his 
[normal]active focus on disability inclusion
[normal] proved very effective. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.4
[normal] 
[normal]The report
[normal] on Lessons L
[normal]earnt from the GFSUP 
[normal]emphasised that disability mu
[normal]st be considered 
[normal]in 
[normal]the project design phase if 
[normal]inclusion of people with 
[normal]disability and/or leprosy is to be effective.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.5
[normal] 
[normal]In 
[normal]order to 
[normal]plan for ‘mainstreaming’
[normal] it is essential 
[normal]that the needs assessment process involves actively seeking out people with disabilities, who in many cultures are often hidden away, explores their needs and involves them in 
[normal]the 
[normal]project design
[normal] process
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.6
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]o assess the effectiveness of ‘mainstreaming’
[normal],
[normal] sufficient baseline data and actively track
[normal]ing
[normal] the engagement of people with disabilities in the intervention
[normal] is paramount
[normal].  Monitoring and evaluation with regard to disability inclusion should be both quantitative, the number of people with disabilities 
[normal]benefiting from the programme, but also qualitative, reflecting their level of participation in project activities as well as the most significant changes 
[normal]seen
[normal] in their lives as a result of the intervention.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.7
[normal] 
[normal]Inc
[normal]lusion of people with disabilities
[normal] is not as
[normal] expensive as often imagined
[normal]. For example
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]within the GFSUP 
[normal]project 
[normal]budget, 
[normal]prov
[normal]ision for people with disabilities
[normal] totalled 
[normal]just 
[normal]6% of project costs
[normal] even though 
[normal]there were many disability-
[normal]specific services
[normal] 
[normal]provided
[normal], demonstrating significant value for 
[normal]money in
[normal] reaching the most marginalised
[normal] and enabling them to contribute to the local economy.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.8
[normal] 
[normal]M
[normal]ainstr
[normal]eaming of people with disabilities
[normal] within a larger project
[normal],
[normal] such as GFSUP
[normal],
[normal] has also 
[normal]helped 
[normal]reduce
[normal] stigma
[normal], as
[normal] 
[normal]disabled members of
[normal] self-he
[normal]lp groups 
[normal]were 
[normal]treated as 
[normal]equal members 
[normal]along
[normal]si
[normal]de
[normal] others with no 
[normal]impairment
[normal]. T
[normal]hey were encouraged to become involved
[normal] in the groups
[normal] and as their confidence and abilities came to the fore, they were respected for their talents 
[normal]and abilities. T
[normal]heir leprosy/
[normal]disability 
[normal]then 
[normal]became 
[normal]much less significant in terms of their status, with many being voted into positions of responsibility within the groups and community.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1
[normal] 
[normal]Disability strategies and programmes 
[normal]must
[normal] recognise that disab
[normal]ility is not just 
[normal]a 
[normal]medical
[normal] condition
[normal]. There are significant s
[normal]ocial impacts of disability
[normal] that must be addressed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal] 
[normal]In many cultures there is shame associated with disability resulting in people with disabilities being hidden away
[normal],
[normal] prevented from engaging in their community and being denied their rights.  People 
[normal]affected by
[normal] leprosy often are scared to admit their condition, or even 
[normal]to 
[normal]seek treatment
[normal],
[normal] because of the stigma and social exclusion that often accompanies diagnosis. Many p
[normal]eople try to hide their disability in order to retain social acceptance. (Annex 2)
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.3
[normal] 
[normal]When people experience clawed hands
[normal] due to leprosy
[normal], not only are they unable to grip things, they ar
[normal]e also unable to greet people
[normal]. A simple 
[normal]Indian 
[normal]gesture of greeting 
[normal]‘namaste’
[normal] 
[normal]highlights not only their disability but often triggers a deeply rooted fea
[normal]r of a disease 
[normal]that 
[normal]leads to stigma and discrimination. 
[normal]As a result
[normal], people affected by leprosy often withdraw from social interaction. Barriers to 
[normal]inclusion are not only 
[normal]physical, but also social and psychosocial
[normal];
[normal] 
[normal]issues of stigma and discrimination
[normal] 
[normal]need to be addressed.  
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.4
[normal] 
[normal]Work
[normal]ing
[normal] with the individual to build confidence and 
[normal]rights
[normal]-awareness
[normal],
[normal] as well as work
[normal]ing
[normal] with the wider community to promote understanding and support is vital
[normal]. 
[normal]For example, in
[normal] the TLMEW-
[normal]supported 
[normal]M
[normal]IRANDA
[normal] project in Myanmar
[normal],
[normal] Disability Resource Centres are providing physiotherapy service
[normal]s
[normal] to people with disabilities, 
[normal]as well as
[normal] counselling an
[normal]d
[normal] rights-
[normal]awareness. They
[normal] have
[normal] 
[normal]established 
[normal]self-help groups w
[normal]h
[normal]ere people with disabilities provide support 
[normal]for
[normal] each other for
[normal] livelihood development and 
[normal]run
[normal] community awareness programmes on disability.  
[normal]These activities have resulted in p
[normal]eople with disabilities 
[normal]became more valued and
[normal] 
[normal]included in 
[normal]society
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]the whole community has
[normal] benefited from more accessible raised pathways that are wheelchair accessible
[normal], meaning they
[normal] 
[normal]no longer have
[normal] to wade through 
[normal]monsoon floods
[normal] to get to 
[normal]the marketpla
[normal]ce
[normal] 
[normal](
[normal]See 
[normal]Annex 3)
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.5
[normal] 
[normal]L
[normal]egal support 
[normal]is 
[normal]also 
[normal]needed 
[normal]to 
[normal]ensure
[normal] 
[normal]national legislation
[normal], policies and practice
[normal] 
[normal]comply
[normal] 
[normal]with the 
[normal]U
[normal]NCRP
[normal]D
[normal] and discriminatory legislation 
[normal]is 
[normal]repealed. For example, leprosy is still grounds for divorce in India.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.1
[normal] 
[normal]Although it is essential to address the rights of persons with disabilities, it should be recognised that some people experience disability that could 
[normal]be
[normal] prevented. M
[normal]inimisation of the cau
[normal]ses of disability is paramount (see Annex 4).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2
[normal] 
[normal]Neglected Tropical Diseases 
[normal](NTDs) 
[normal]such as 
[normal]Leprosy, Lymphatic 
[normal]Filariasis
[normal] and Trachoma 
[normal]are a significant cause of serious disability worldwide 
[normal]representing
[normal] high levels of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYS - the sum of the potential life lost due to pr
[normal]emature mortality and the years of productive life lost due to disability)
[normal]. These treatable diseases 
[normal]must be addressed in order to prevent people developing disabilities
[normal]. Thus,
[normal] DFID’s approach to NTDs should be li
[normal]nked to its disability strategy.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]6.3
[normal] 
[normal]A
[normal]ddressing NTDs is not just about mass drug administration. For many of those who have received late diagnosis and treatment
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]disability is already a result.
[normal] For some the disability is obvious. Others, including 
[normal]people
[normal] affected by leprosy
[normal], 
[normal]may not have a vi
[normal]sual disability
[normal] but like those with diabetes
[normal] the sensation loss they experience
[normal] is 
[normal]disabling
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]P
[normal]roper self-care and management of their conditions is 
[normal]essential in preventing 
[normal]further disability.
[normal] 
[normal]A
[normal] disability i
[normal]s not always visible 
[normal]n
[normal]or obvious, yet 
[normal]n
[normal]ot 
[normal]supporting 
[normal]a person 
[normal]in
[normal] prevention of disability
[normal] 
[normal]can
[normal] lead to further 
[normal]impairment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]7.1
[normal] 
[normal]Inequalities intersect
[normal],
[normal] so a person with 
[normal]a 
[normal]disability may also be marginalised in other ways such as gender, caste, 
[normal]ethnicity
[normal], living in
[normal] remote
[normal] locations
[normal] or by leprosy
[normal]-related
[normal] stigma
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]7.2
[normal] 
[normal]B
[normal]eing marginalised in one way 
[normal]often
[normal] leads to 
[normal]other forms of marginalisation
[normal]; for example poor access to health care due to discrimination due to ethnicity or caste may lead to late treatment 
[normal]after 
[normal]an accident 
[normal]or after contracting a disease
[normal],
[normal] resulting in disability.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]7.3
[normal] 
[normal]It is notable that the risk of disability occurring is heightene
[normal]d due to marginalisation
[normal],
[normal] and further marginalisation is more likely 
[normal]to occur
[normal] due to disability. 
[normal] [bold]This therefore leads to 
[normal]a 
[normal]bi
[normal]-
[normal]directional link to poverty: disability may increase the risk of poverty, and poverty may increase the risk of disability
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]DFID should:
[normal]8.1
[normal] 
[normal]Demonstrate[bold] best practice[bold] 
[normal]in inclusive development[bold] by 
[normal]building disability into [bold]its strategic frameworks[bold] and budgets[bold], and 
[normal]develop
[normal]ing
[normal] an 
[normal]equity and inclusion strategy [bold]that ensures 
[normal]a focus on disability inclusion. This should include 
[normal]assigning a senior staff member at DFID and a lead person responsible for disability inclusion in [bold]each country office[bold]. This person
[normal] would
[normal] have responsibility for championing and monitoring
[normal] disab
[normal]ility incl
[normal]usion, 
[normal]sharing good practice
[normal] and ensuring the implementation of Article 32 of the 
[normal]UNCRPD
[normal].

[normal] 
[normal]T[bold]ake a leadership role in discussion[bold]s[bold] around the post-2015 development framework[bold], 
[normal]championing disability[bold] inclusion[bold] to ensure it is an integral part of any new development framework
[normal]. To maintain its commitment to the implementation of disability inclusive development
[normal] and to keep disability on the international agenda
[normal], DFID should 
[normal]make specific disability-related 
[normal]pledge
[normal]s in 2014 e.g. three
[normal] DFID country programmes to be fully inclusive be 2016, all DFID funded projects required to report on disability disaggregated data, etc.)
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]8.3
[normal]

[normal]

[normal]Disability’ a core, cross[bold]-[bold]cutting element of all [bold]development [bold]programmes[bold],[bold] [bold]investing in good practice and recognising the benefits of[bold] a [bold]twin track approach.[bold] Guidance should recommend that
[normal] mainstream NGOs and G

[normal]s partner
[normal] 
[normal]with organisation
[normal]s
[normal] with expertise in 
[normal]disability, such as Disable

[normal] 
[normal]E[bold]nsure [bold]the[bold]

[normal]Ann[bold]ex 2[bold] – Case Study[bold]Jahiruddin, India[bold]Jahiruddin Kahan is 
[normal]married with two children and two grandchildren. He has a small stationers shop on the edge of Kolkata. Twenty years ago, when he was 41 years old, he fell from a minibus and a stone went inside his leg. The ulcer that developed would not heal and he spent
[normal] over 10 years going to different hospitals and doctors to get help. One 
[normal]doctor gave him medicine to which his body seemed to react and he became covered with boils.  He went to a skin specialist who referred him to an expert in tropical medicine.  It was 
[normal]there that leprosy was eventually diagnosed, he was given MDT and eventually the ulcer healed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, 10 years without a diagnosis took its toll on his feet and nerve damage was evident. In 2003 he developed another ulcer and came to TLM’s Hospital.  Here doctors recognised that he had been given the wrong dose of MDT originally so he was given a 
[normal]new treatment regime, his leg was put in plaster to help his ulcer to heal and he returned home, coming back to the hospital every 15 days for a check-up and the rest of his treatment.  However, he never told anyone that he had leprosy. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Four months ago h
[normal]e injured his toe and so he returned to the place where he had received loving care.  However, the severity of his wound meant that he needed a skin graft and a month of bed rest.  During this time, Kavita, a hospital volunteer, has been encouraging people
[normal] to learn to read and write.  Jahiruddin was already literate and could write well in Bengali, so he decided to use his time in bed to write a story.  During my visit he proudly read what he had written, a story about a man, magic and a mango tree, a story
[normal] with a clear moral message of the need to obey your master and the importance of honesty.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Yet this talented man also expressed that he is frightened that when he returns home people will be suspicious of the causes of his problem since he has been away h
[normal]aving treatment for so long.  He is worried that if they guess his disability is due to leprosy that he will be excluded by the local community of which he is a part.  As for his dreams, he said, “I want people to understand that leprosy is curable and not
[normal] a curse, I want to return to my community as a businessman, not an untouchable. Don’t let them call me a ‘leper’.”

[normal]Annex 3 – Case Study[bold]Kan, Myanmar [bold]&#xa0;[bold]Kan Tint
[normal] [bold]is
[normal] [bold]67 years old and is married with seven children.  27 years ago he developed leprosy but 
[normal]waited for 7 years before accessing treatment, by which time the disease had attacked his nerves and he had permanent disability. However, it was not just his physical disability, cause by his clawed hands and loss 
[normal]of digits, which affected his life.  More
[normal] painful than the physical impairment was the social stigma he experienced. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Kan was rejected by his community and not allowed to attend social functions such as weddings or Buddhist festivals. He was looked down upon with distain and his friends desert
[normal]ed him.  He faced such rejection and despair that he tried to commit suicide twice, the first by taking tablets and then by hanging.  Eventually his family chained him up to prevent his suicide attempts.  The stigma, discrimination and isolation all got to
[normal]o much for Kan and he decided to move out of the village he had called home to go and live with his grandchildren.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It was here that he came in contact with The Leprosy Mission. Staff provided him with psychosocial support and worked with the community t
[normal]o raise awareness about leprosy and disability, working with them to help reintegrate Kan back into the community. It has been a long process, but he is now accepted in his village and can join in celebrations and community events without being shunned.  H
[normal]e is treated just like anyone else and now has the joys of watching his grandchildren growing up without being isolated from community life.

[normal]Annex 4 – Case study Nafisa, Nigeria[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Nafisa Aminou, 20, is from Nigeria and was told, aged 14, she had 
[normal]leprosy and was advised to go to hospital for treatment. But instead she was given traditional herbal treatment for five years. If she was given multidrug therapy at an early stage, it would have been highly unlikely that she would have become disabled.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]E
[normal]ighteen months ago she developed painful ulcers on her legs and hearing of the reputation of The Leprosy Mission's services run from Danja Hospital, she and her mother crossed the border to Niger. On arrival from Nigeria, Nafisa had seriously shortened lim
[normal]bs as a result of her untreated leprosy and her legs were too painful to be touched below the knees. She was given multidrug therapy to treat the disease and her legs were bandaged to in attempt to remove the swelling and some of the pain.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Wheelchair-bound, she began physiotherapy sessions to improve her mobility. Her legs were put in a plaster cast to straighten them and Boehler irons were attached to the plaster casts for walking. She is now able to walk with the help of a walking frame bu
[normal]t she is still awaiting surgery on her lower legs which will further increase her independence.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Despite her disabilities Nafisa is hugely grateful for the medical treatment and love she has received at Danja Hospital. She is optimistic that her mobility w
[normal]ill continue to improve and she dreams of marrying and having children.
