defaultDeclaration
default of interests
default:
defaultI am a doctoral researcher at Cardiff University studying the i
defaultmpact
default of Police and Crime Commissioners in two case study areas (South Wales and Avon and Somerset
default) o
defaultn agenda setting in the context of community safety. I have therefore approached this report from an academic 
defaultperspective,
default looking at examples of collaborative best practice between Commissioners and local authority partners,
default between
default Commissioners and research institutes, and between
default 
defaultCommissioners themselves. 
defaultEvidence submitted is the result of interviews, observations and document analysis in South Wales and Avon and 
defaultSomerset
default, and desk-
defaultbased research for other force areas.

defaultThe ambiguity of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 in outlining the 
defaultroles and responsibilities 
defaultof Police and Crime Commissioners
default has
default led to variation across England and Wales in terms of 
defaultwho is involved in collaboration
default, and on what matters. 
default&#xa0;
default2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultPACE Act 1984 acknowledged that core police and criminal justice agencies are unable to comprehend and prevent crime and disorder issues alone, and thus emphasised the need for agencies to work in partnership
default. 
defaultSince then, both voluntary and statutory partnerships between relevant agencies have been implemented, with varying degrees of success. These partnerships can be argued to have created silos within a fragmented criminal justice ‘system’, in which both overlapping and contradictory priorities, targets and funding streams exist. Police and Crime Commissioner
defaults
default are
default well placed
default to better align 
defaultsuch
default partnerships, 
defaultand rejuvenate
default joined-up
default prevention and interventio
defaultn. 
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe health sector has been identified as a key partner of the police. In 
defaultSouth Wales
default the Commissioner takes an analytical evidence-based approach to the role, looking to the work of 
defaultProfessor 
defaultJonathan Shepherd at a local Accident and Emergency Department who identifies 
defaultthat
default violent incidences i
defaultn the night-time economy lead
default to pressure on both the police 
defaultand
default health institutions. In 
defaultCardiff
default city centre a small triage facility is 
defaultnow 
defaultavailable on weekends, thus reducing the volume of low-severity patients needing transport to Accident and Emergency Department outside the city centre and then using resources there. 
defaultThe triage facility
default is run by staff from the police, health sector, local authorities and third sector
default,
default and the South Wales Commissioner aims to take a similar baseline approach to all Accident and Emergency Departments across 
defaultSouth Wales
default. 
default&#xa0;

defaultMental health is an issue that 
defaultseveral
default Police and Crime Commissioners have committed themselves to targeting
default, albeit through different collaboration
defaults
default. 
defaultThe Commissioner for Greater Manchester
default acknowledges the amount of police time it takes to administer the appropriate response for someone who is suffering from mental health problems, and has invested
default £200,000 of this year’s 
defaultbudget to partnership working wi
defaultth the NHS to develop innovations aimed at improving the current response.
default 
defaultIn 
defaultStaffordshire
default,
default 
defaultthe 
defaultCommissioner held group meetings with Police Officers, PCSOs and Staff below the rank of Inspector to discuss their day-to-day working lives, and found that issues of mental he
defaultalth were 
defaultconsistently raised
default. Recording the
default details of every incident involving mental health over an eight week period proved the scale of the issue, and the complexity of agencies involved. Since then, a ‘whole system’ approach has 
defaultbeen 
defaultdeveloped with stakeholders across health, social care and the voluntary sector to ensure a timely and appropriate response, as well as 
defaultbringing mental health professionals 
defaultto the frontline, 
defaultworking alongsid
defaulte the police
default.
default 
defaultIn 
defaultAvon and 
defaultSomerset
default, the C
defaultommissioner
default states that 646 people were detained under the Mental Health Act in police cells in 2012/13, and is changing the custody landscape with the aim of having no mental health patients in police cells by April 2014. Care planning is also being improved through collaboration
default with Mental Health liaison and Diversion Services.

defaultThe Police and Crime Commissioner for
default Northamptonshire
default is one of a few Commissioners who 
defaultcall
default for the integration of 
defaultthe three main emergency response services: 
defaultpolice, fi
defaultre and ambulance. The argument for doing so is that 
defaultit will deliver effective, efficient services of high standard and will save valuable resources to sustain the frontline by handling emergency calls only once
default a
defaultnd commanding
default resources in a joined-up way.
default 
default&#xa0;
default6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBoth Northamptonshire and Greater Manchester Commissioners have highlighted the lack of ‘system’ in the Criminal Justice System
default. G
defaultreater 
defaultM
defaultanchester
default Commissioner has had pragmatic discussions with the Courts, prosecutors, probation, police and other criminal justice partners about how to improve victim services. The outcomes of these meetings have already been piloted: in one 
defaultlocal 
defaultarea the police and probation are now based together to manage offenders
default,
default 
defaultas well as
default improve preventative measures; in another area, 
defaulta mult
defaulti-agency approach 
defaulthas been
default taken to counter organised crime networks, 
defaultresulting in arrests and 
defaultthe 
defaultse
defaultizure of millions of pounds worth
default of property and drugs. Agencies involved included 
defaultall 
defaultemergency services, councils, the Serious Organised Crime Agency, NHS, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, and the Illegal Money Lending Team, as well as other public bodies, thus extending inve
defaultstigation into every area of a
default criminal’s life.  
default&#xa0;
default7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSome Police and Crime Commissioners have focussed
default on
default 
defaultgaps in the protection of victims and potential victims, and the impact that private businesses have on these gaps
default. 
defaultIn Northumbria, the Commissioner has recognised that the night-time economy in Newcastle is not a safe place for the vulnerable
default,
default despite work by the local BCU and Safe Newcastle Partnership. To tackle 
defaultviolence again
defaultst
default women, 
defaultthe Commissioner has facilitated 
defaulta training
default course 
defaultfor door supervisors to learn how to assess triggers of vulnerability. The course was developed by Northumbria Police, Safe Newcastle, the local authority safeguarding and licensing teams, Tyneside Rape Crisis and the le
defaultading local door
default staff company. This company
default ensured that all their staff undertook the train
defaulting in weeks, and other security
default firms quickly
default followed, with the police present at each step. 
defaultAs a consequence 
defaultof this collaboration, and the
default gap in National Security Industry Training being acknowledged, Northumbria’s programme has become a compulsory part of the national training. 
default&#xa0;
default8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs well as collaborating with partners from both the public, private and voluntary sectors, some Commissioners are recognising that the Chief Constable of their force is also a partner.
default For example,
default 
defaultthe Commissioner for 
defaultSouth Wales
default refers to the Chief as a partner, recognising it as a mutually challenging relationship but with clear areas of responsibility
default.
default&#xa0;
default9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPolice and Crime Commissioners are also collaborating regionally on specific aspects of policing. 
defaultFive Police and Crime Commissioners in the South West have joined up to collaborate on several aspects of policing, aiming to improve efficiency and remove duplication, increase resilience, and enhance capacity, capability and flexibility. Avon and 
defaultSomerset
default, Wiltshire, Dorset, Devon and 
defaultCornwall
default, and 
defaultGloucester
default have collaborated on a dedicated counter terrorism team, police dogs and some aspects of road safety and also introduced a single, shared special branch IT intelligence system
default. 
defaultIn addition, t
defaulthese five commissioners have signed their forces up to a new Code of Ethics to help assure the public of standards of policing. The code is aligned with existing police regulations and professional standards and has been influenced by the Code of Ethics put in place when the Police Service of Northern Ireland was established. 
default&#xa0;
default10.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe establishment of the East Midlands 
defaultSpecial Operations Unit
default over a decade 
defaultago
default marked the beginning of collaborative policing
default in
default the area, which is now delivered 
defaultby this unit and the East Midlands Police Collaboration Programme. Since their election, these collaboration arrangements have been overseen by the five Police and Crime Commissioners of Derbyshire, Leicestershire, 
defaultLincolnshire
default, Northamptonshire and Nottinghamshire. Areas of policing covered by these collaborations include: serious and organised crime, major crime, intelligence, forensics and counter-terrorism, as well the
default organisational support functions
default of IT infrastructure, police legal services, training programmes, fraud and financial investigati
defaultons and the regionalisation of human resources
default data. 
default&#xa0;
default11.
default&#xa0; 
defaultPolice and Crime Commissioners and Chief Constables from Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire have signed up to a ‘Memorandum of Understanding’ and will collaborate on specific operational and organisational functions. These include finance, fleet, estates and facilities, legal, human resources, professional standards, training, ICT, firearms licensing, custody and crime recording.
default The aim of this collaboration is to assist with safeguarding police office numbers and enhance economic efficiency of services. 
default&#xa0;
default12.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe four Welsh Police and Crime Commissioners have formed an ‘All-
defaultWales
default Commissioners’ group. Meeting quarterly, moving around the force areas, the Commissioners discuss Wales-wide strategic issues and identify common issues where they can work together. They have met jointly with stakeholders in the Drug Intervention Programme, and the Welsh Government Director of Corporate Services and Partnerships, indicating that priority is being given to these topics.
default&#xa0;
default13.
default&#xa0; 
defaultSeveral Police and Crime Commissioners are 
defaultcollaborating with U
defaultniversities 
defaulton
default 
defaultevidence-based research 
defaulton local crime and disorder. Police and Crime Commissioner for Northamptonshire is establishing a ‘Police, Crime and Justice Institute’ within a University to bring together research activity and practical translation of research evidence 
defaultwith the aim of
default enha
defaultncing
default problem solving. In South Wales, the Universities P
defaultolice Science Institute (UPSI) is a
defaultn
default innovative partnership 
defaultbetween Cardiff University’s Viol
defaultence and Society Research Group
default and South Wales Police, 
defaultand is supported by the South Wales Commissioner wit
defaulth funding of £1.2 million over five
default years.
default The collaboration focuses upon community engagement, intelligence and neighbourhood policing, countering violent extremism and police innovation and reform. 
default&#xa0;
default14.
default&#xa0; 
defaultOn the 10
defaultth
default December 2013 the Home Office invited all Police and Crime Commissioners and Chief Constables to a
defaultn
default ‘
defaultInnovation through C
defaultollaboration
default’ summit
default to review existing collaboration and facilitate further discussion. The agenda for the day 
defaultfocussed
default o
defaultn the benefits of collaboration, particularly 
defaultvalue for money and improving services, and working on bids for the Police Innovation fund. 
default&#xa0;
default15.
default&#xa0; 
defaultPolice and Crime Commissioners appear to be well placed to enhance collaboration
default between and with partnerships and 
defaultcreate innovations in research.
default The regional collaborations between Police and Crime Commissioners demonstrate recognition of needing to do more with less.
default As democratically elected individuals 
defaultPolice and Crime Commissioners have the opportunity to 
defaultspeak openly about areas that require reform or would benefit from a more collaborative approach, and therefore break down organisational silos.
