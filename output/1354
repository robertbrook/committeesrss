defaultIntroductiondefault&#xa0;defaultIn our approach to this submission we wanted to avoid a finger pointing exercise or a blame game and instead
default look to the future
default and learn
default from the past.
default In the course of preparing this submission we have met the four main banks in Northern Ireland, Ulster Bank, Danske
default Bank
default, First Trust and Bank of Ireland.

defaultWe want a new

default&#xa0;
defaultSurvey Resultsdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe survey focused on NIIRTA members’ ability to access finance, credit card and overdraft services, the bank branch closure programme and overall customer satisfaction with their 
defaultbanks.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis is the first ever survey of the views on banking services from independent retailers across Northern Ireland and shows that a majority of those surveyed are satisfied with the services they receive from local banks
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default65% of those who have applied for finance within the last three years were successful in accessing it, which suggests an improving trend given the
default difficult trading conditions of
default the last year.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever banks still have some way to go in this area as 35% w
defaultere turned down for finance.
default 
defaultWe hope that when we repeat this survey next year there will be great improvement shown in this area.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default64% of those surveyed have an overdraft with a third of them unhappy as their bank had unilaterally change
defaultd the conditions of the overdraft re
defaultsulting in a negative impact on 
defaulttheir business.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default62% of those surveyed have a company credit card with only 3% claiming that their bank had altered the contract to the detriment of their business.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultGiven the recent closure of bank branches, we were keen to see how this had impacted on footfall and spending patterns.
default 
defaultWhile 76% said there has been no impact, 24% said they have been affected.
default 
defaultRural members especially expressed concern a
defaultt the greater distances they now had to travel to their local banks to lodge money.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default42% rate the service from their bank as good or excellent, 38% average and 20% below average or poor. The banking sector overall will be happy with 
defaultthis figure and it demonstrates that they have responded to pressure from our members and Government to improve.

default&#xa0;defaultRecommendationsdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe independent retail sector in Northern Ireland is one of the most innovative, vibrant, varied and important - but it is also one of the most fragile. 
default&#xa0;
defaultLacking the critical mass and resources of the large multiples, 
defaultindependent traders can be more susceptible to economic changes. Of those we surveyed who tried to access finance in the last three years, 35% were unsuccessful. This is concer
defaultning. We need a banking system 
defaultwhich better understands small retailers. Our mem
defaultbers are a key driver of growth in Northern Ireland and efficient funding and support is vital to our sector in supporting economic recovery.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWe would 
defaultmake the following recommendations
default:
default&#xa0;
defaultNorthern Ireland Banking Forumdefault&#xa0;
defaultAs Banking regulations are not a devolved matter, we suggest that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland establish and Chair a 
defaultNI Banking Forum
default. This would include representatives from the Banks, Business Organisations and Executive Ministers for Ente
defaultrprise and Finance.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe envisage this Forum to be a mechanism to promote good communication and indeed to resolve any issues such as we have identified in our survey. This Forum should meet at least twice a year.
default&#xa0;
defaultBranch Vacancy Strategydefault&#xa0;defaultBank b
defaultranch
defaultes are
default a
defaultn
default essential element in our High Streets and Town Centres, both in terms of generating footfall and service provision for local traders.
default All the banks need to ensure that 
defaultthere is 
defaultadequate consultation with local stakeholders in advance of any intended cl
defaultosures.
default&#xa0;
defaultWith the high volume of bank branch closures in Northern Ireland we need all banks to commit themselves to a target of alternative use of the empty buildings within three months of closure.
default&#xa0;
defaultAlternative use such a new retail store, pop up shop, or
default being used a communi
defaultty group will boost 
defaultthe 
defaultfootfall which the branch closure has reduced. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOverdrafts and Credit Cardsdefault&#xa0;
defaultAs evidenced in our survey B
defaultanks unilaterally changing the o
defaultverdrafts of our members is still a cause for concern. We recommend a tig
defaulthtening of regulations covering the conditions on Overdraft and Credit cards to ensure that small business customers are not negatively impacted by any 
defaultsuch 
defaultchanges.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe would recommend that 
defaultthe 
defaultFinancial Conduct Authority examine this area as a matter of
default priority.
