[normal]Written evidence submitted by the[bold]Northern Ireland Independent Retail Trade Association (NIIRTA)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The Northern Ireland Indep
[normal]endent Retail Trade Association
[normal] welcomes the opportunity to submit evidence to this timely enquiry into Banking in Northern Ireland.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]NIIRTA r
[normal]epresents over 1400 Independent Retailers, Wholesalers; Suppliers to the sector and many local town based Chambers of Commerce and Traders
[normal]’
[normal] Group
[normal]s. We have members in every village, town and city in Northern Ireland.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As part of our submission we have conducted the first ever survey of independent retailers
[normal]’
[normal] views on Banking issues and how it impacts on their business
[normal]es
[normal]. 100 independent retailers f
[normal]rom across Northern Ir
[normal]eland (representing 14% of our members responded to a
[normal] telephone survey conducted in August.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;[bold]In our approach to this submission we wanted to avoid a finger pointing exercise or a blame game and instead
[normal] look to the future
[normal] and learn
[normal] from the past.
[normal] In the course of preparing this submission we have met the four main banks in Northern Ireland, Ulster Bank, Danske
[normal] Bank
[normal], First Trust and Bank of Ireland.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We want a new
[normal],
[normal] more 
[normal]flexible
[normal] and open banking 
[normal]system, which
[normal] can support an
[normal]d finance a 
[normal]new 
[normal]small business led sustainable recovery. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Survey Results[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The survey focused on NIIRTA members’ ability to access finance, credit card and overdraft services, the bank branch closure programme and overall customer satisfaction with their 
[normal]banks.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This is the first ever survey of the views on banking services from independent retailers across Northern Ireland and shows that a majority of those surveyed are satisfied with the services they receive from local banks
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]65% of those who have applied for finance within the last three years were successful in accessing it, which suggests an improving trend given the
[normal] difficult trading conditions of
[normal] the last year.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However banks still have some way to go in this area as 35% w
[normal]ere turned down for finance.
[normal] 
[normal]We hope that when we repeat this survey next year there will be great improvement shown in this area.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]64% of those surveyed have an overdraft with a third of them unhappy as their bank had unilaterally change
[normal]d the conditions of the overdraft re
[normal]sulting in a negative impact on 
[normal]their business.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]62% of those surveyed have a company credit card with only 3% claiming that their bank had altered the contract to the detriment of their business.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Given the recent closure of bank branches, we were keen to see how this had impacted on footfall and spending patterns.
[normal] 
[normal]While 76% said there has been no impact, 24% said they have been affected.
[normal] 
[normal]Rural members especially expressed concern a
[normal]t the greater distances they now had to travel to their local banks to lodge money.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]42% rate the service from their bank as good or excellent, 38% average and 20% below average or poor. The banking sector overall will be happy with 
[normal]this figure and it demonstrates that they have responded to pressure from our members and Government to improve.

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Recommendations[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The independent retail sector in Northern Ireland is one of the most innovative, vibrant, varied and important - but it is also one of the most fragile. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Lacking the critical mass and resources of the large multiples, 
[normal]independent traders can be more susceptible to economic changes. Of those we surveyed who tried to access finance in the last three years, 35% were unsuccessful. This is concer
[normal]ning. We need a banking system 
[normal]which better understands small retailers. Our mem
[normal]bers are a key driver of growth in Northern Ireland and efficient funding and support is vital to our sector in supporting economic recovery.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We would 
[normal]make the following recommendations
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Northern Ireland Banking Forum[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]As Banking regulations are not a devolved matter, we suggest that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland establish and Chair a 
[normal]NI Banking Forum
[normal]. This would include representatives from the Banks, Business Organisations and Executive Ministers for Ente
[normal]rprise and Finance.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We envisage this Forum to be a mechanism to promote good communication and indeed to resolve any issues such as we have identified in our survey. This Forum should meet at least twice a year.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Branch Vacancy Strategy[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Bank b
[normal]ranch
[normal]es are
[normal] a
[normal]n
[normal] essential element in our High Streets and Town Centres, both in terms of generating footfall and service provision for local traders.
[normal] All the banks need to ensure that 
[normal]there is 
[normal]adequate consultation with local stakeholders in advance of any intended cl
[normal]osures.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]With the high volume of bank branch closures in Northern Ireland we need all banks to commit themselves to a target of alternative use of the empty buildings within three months of closure.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Alternative use such a new retail store, pop up shop, or
[normal] being used a communi
[normal]ty group will boost 
[normal]the 
[normal]footfall which the branch closure has reduced. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Overdrafts and Credit Cards[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]As evidenced in our survey B
[normal]anks unilaterally changing the o
[normal]verdrafts of our members is still a cause for concern. We recommend a tig
[normal]htening of regulations covering the conditions on Overdraft and Credit cards to ensure that small business customers are not negatively impacted by any 
[normal]such 
[normal]changes.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We would recommend that 
[normal]the 
[normal]Financial Conduct Authority examine this area as a matter of
[normal] priority.
