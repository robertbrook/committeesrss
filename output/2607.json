Collaboration and formal partnerships with global and regional conservation NGOs have shaped Rio Tinto’s global and regional biodiversity strategies and objectives\n on “net positive impact”. Our learning from NGOs has contributed to the development of tools and methodologies used in this field. \nIn mid-2010 Rio\n&#xa0;\nTinto signed a three year relationship agreement with the \nInternational Union for Conservation of Nature\n (IUCN). This partnership includes the design and implementation of an assessment process that will be used to assess how Rio Tinto is doing is achieving its “net positiv\ne impact” goals. Other biodiversity partners include: \nBirdLife International\n, \nFauna &amp; Flora International\n and \nRoyal Botanic Gardens, Kew.\n \nQ 7.
