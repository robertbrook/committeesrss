"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nSue Mountstevens\n,\nPolice and Crime Commissioner for Avon &amp; Somerset\n [PCC Progress 17]\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.1 \n              \nIt has been a busy and challenging first year in office as Police and Crime Commissioner for Avon and Somerset. I have\n been clear that I see my role as fulfilling three prime purposes:- \nThe overriding impression from the first year is the public response that I have received – I have had over 20 times the level of correspondence that the Police Authority had in its last year of operation. Local people do raise their policing issues, concerns and comments with me and I have worked \nclosely\n with the local Constabulary to ensure that these are taken into account.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;2.1 \n              \nO\nverall levels of crime and anti-social behaviour in Avon and Somerset \nhave continued to fall during 2013/14, both in terms of those recorded by police and through self-reported victimisation \nsurveys.  \nWhile this is clearly positive, it is not something that myself, \nthe C\nonstabulary no\nr\n any other single agency can take credit for and is \nsimilarly reflected across most \nForces\n nationally and across the western world. My role as Police and Crime Commissioner and the priorities set as part of my Police and Crime Plan have, however, supported a clear step change in crime reduction across some specific and important areas.\n&#xa0;2.2               My Police and Crime P\nlan set the aspiration to become a top performing force across all \nof my priority areas \nand \nachieve year on year improvements in the services delivered. We are already seeing significant progress across a number of these priorities.  Burglary performance, for example, has been a historic challenge for Avon and Somerset for many years. The partnership and organisational focus that has been brought about as a conse\nquence of the Police and Crime P\nlan has, however seen \nnot only significant improvement\ns\n but \nalso relative\n improvement against most other police forces nationally. In the last 12 months, Avon and Somerset has moved from a below average position (24\nth\n and 29\nth\n out of 43 forces nationally) to having the 15\nth\n lowest rate of burglary and the 16\nth\n highest detection rate\n \nnationally.  Performance in this area continues to improve placing Avon and Somerset well on track to become a top 10 national performer by 2017.\n&#xa0;\n2.3              \nI have set a priority of putting victims at the heart of the Criminal Justice System\n.  A sustained focus on this approach has seen victim satisfaction rates increase from 86.7% to 89.2%, which also places Avon and Somerset on track to becoming a top 10 national performer by 2017.  \n&#xa0;2.4              We\n \nstill have much work to do delivering the aspirations of the Police and Crime Plan, particularly in \nincreas\ning confidence amongst victims of domestic and \nsexual violence to report their victimisation and improving satisfaction and service responses to anti-social behaviour.  \nI am, however confident that through strong leadership and a commitment to evidence–led planning and policy making, sustained progress will be made across all of my priority areas, despite the economic, environmental and organisational challenges that lie ahead.\n&#xa0;2.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI also believe that despite the encouraging \ncrime \nreduction trends, under-reporting of offences remains \nwidespread making \nthe \ngathering \nof \na true intelligence\n picture more difficult. I continue to urge victims of crime to always report the incidents so that we continue to build a true picture of all crime types in our Region. I am also supporting investment in improved technology to serve front line officers to ensure that they have the right tools for the job. \n&#xa0;2.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI believe that one of the \nkey test\ns of an\n effective\n police service is in the confidence of local people in that service. \nAfter a period of decline\n in Avon and Somerset\n, p\nublic confidence in policing has seen notable sustained\n \nimprovement \nsince November 2012 \n– and continues\n to \nrise. \n The latest crime survey for England and Wales figures for Avon and Somerset show that 73% of people have confidence in their local police. \n&#xa0;\n2.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI feel that communicating and informing local people is key to improving public confidence and as such, I \nhave \ndeveloped accessible \nlocal policing plans \nthat\n reflect the priorities of local people. In my first year I have visited over 120 voluntary/community groups; dealt with over 4\n,\n000 contacts from local people; attended 143 events and consulted with over 5\n,\n000 people on their concerns and views. All of this public contact has helped to inform the priorities in the Police and Crime Plans and also to inform the decisions which I am making about Police Council Tax precept. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;3.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI believe that the most important aspect\n of holding the Chief Constable to account is to ensure that there is an open and transparent approach from the Chief Constable and the Constabulary to the policing of their local area. I recruited a Chief Constable who took office in March of this year. One of the key requirements which was tested through that recruitment process was a commitment from the candidate to openness and transparency \nin carrying out their work. The\n commitment \nof\n Chief Constable Nick Gargan\n to this approach\n has been demonstrated throughout his first 8 months in office. \n&#xa0;\n3.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOne of \nthe key ways in which I hold the Chief Constable to account is through the use of public forums – I have been holding a public meeting involving myself, the Chief Constable, the local District Commander and other local officers coming together to briefly present on key issues and then publicly answer any question which are raised by members of the public. I also hold regular meetings with the Chief Constable and portfolio meetings with each of the Chief Officer group around the key areas of their responsibility and produce notes of these meetings which appear on my website. I have also recruited a panel of independent residents who review complaint files against the Constabulary and produce public facing reports \n(\nincluding a public facing response from the Constabulary to the issues raised on the handling of those complaints\n)\n. I have also listened to local people through my many interactions with them and organised issue specific initiatives around areas such as business crime, rural crime \nand road safety, including public meetings. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;4.1              \nI believe that \nPolice and Crime Panels\n have an important role in the overall effectiveness \nof the Police and Crime Commissioner system by allowing public scrutiny of the PCC\n’\ns decisions.  I have a \nprofessional and appropriate\n relationship \nwith my Police and Crime Panel.  \nWe have \nbuilt effective\n working relationships with \nthe Panel Chair and officer support to \ndevelop \na\n Work Programme \nthat delivers the business of the Panel \nand \nhave established joint\n agenda briefings in advance of each panel meeting\n to ensure that the Panel has access to the information they need to carry out their role\n.\n  \nWe have tried to provide proactive briefing and transparency to the panel on key issues as they develop. For example we have organised a proactive background briefing on the Police budget to provide more \ninformation in advance of this P\nolice budg\net round. The Police and Crime P\nanel have also appointed link members to align with the key activities of myself and my team to enable them to be more fully briefed on the key issues and then brief the rest of the panel. \n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;5.1              \nThe Chief Constable and myself\n have\n agreed and published a joint vision of how we would carry out our respective roles. This is based on a mutual understanding and respect for each other’s different but complimentary roles. We have submitted a draft transfer scheme to the Home Secretary based on that joint vision \nwhich was then\n worked on in detail by a joint board \njointly \nchaired by the PCC Chief Executive and the Deputy Chief Constable. Our proposal involves the transfer of the legal employment of all current Constabulary staff to the Office of \nthe Chief Constable and includes\n deta\niled service level agreements for\n the service\ns\n that will be provided by the Office of the Chief Constable to the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner in key areas, including performance analysis, communications, consultation and engagement and strategic planning. All assets and reserves will be retained within the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner but utilised by the Constabulary pursuant to a detailed Scheme of Governance.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;6.1 I \nagreed a balanced budget for my first \nfull \nyear \n(\n2013/15\n)\n with a frozen\n council tax\n precept. The precept freeze was an election pledge which I wished to honour if appropriate budget savings could be agreed with the Chief Constable. Having reviewed the draft financial plans with the Chief and the 2 CFOs we were able to identify \n£9.5\n million of new savings for 2013/14 to balance the budget. This brings cumulative savings at Avon &amp; Somerset to £35 million since the start of the current CSR and means that Avon &amp; Somerset residents have had 3 \nsuccessive \nyears of frozen council tax police precept.\n&#xa0;\n6.2 This year I have consulted widely with the public about police services \nand funding a\nnd precept levels – \nreceiving\n \nresponses f\nr\no\nm over 5000 residents\n and attending over 140 community events. Their feedback is informing my view on setting the police precept level for 2014/15. I attend regular Finance Boards with the 2 CFOs and regular one to one meetings with the chief. At these I have scrutinised the financial \nprojections \nand the budget on a line by line basis and have pushed hard for efficiency savings and savings from collaboration and innovation.\n              \nI have agreed a savings plan for 2014/15 with the Chief\n to deliver a further £\n12 million savings and this will balance the budget \nfor next year \nwith a 2% rise in police precept – which reflects the majority view of residents. \nI have published financial outcomes and forecasts on my web site and discussed my plans with the Police &amp; Crime Panel.\n&#xa0;\n6.3 I monitor actual financial outcomes compared to budget on a quarterly basis and scrutiny of budget underspends has identified areas for future savings and I have ensured these are taken out of budgets at the earliest opportunity.\n&#xa0;\n6.4 I have approved a \ntreasury\n \nmanagement\n strategy with my CFO and adopted a passive borrowing strategy to \nminimise borrowing requirements.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;7.1              As referred to above, a main feature of the work I have carried out is to listen to the views of local people, particularly the quiet voices or those whose views have not traditionally been taken into account when setting police priorities and budgets. That extensive consultation and the setting of local policing plans, combined with local meetings and a large increase\n in the amount of contacts has ensured that local policing priorities are much more effectively driven by the views of local people.\n In addition\n,\n I also spend at least one dedicated day a week out and about in the local communities of Avon and Somerset visiting a myriad of projects\n,\n hearing from service users and holding public drop in sessions. This has enabled me to effectively hear from the quiet voices by visiting refuges, homeless shelters and treatment centres, to name but a few, in order to ensure I reflect their views in setting policing priorities. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;8.1              \nI met with the other 4 regional Police and Crime Commissioners within a few days of taking office. We swiftly agreed a joint vision for collaboration in the South West Region and we also agreed a standard template and basis of finalising our agreements. We have since signed up to a number of major collaboration agreements including:-\n              \nWe continue to work on developing other opportunities for Regional collaboration and interoperability.\n&#xa0;\n8.2 \n              \nIn addition I have supported the Constabulary in an initiative to develop a range of integrated services involving other local partners including particularly the Criminal Justice Board, Local Authorities\n, Voluntary Sector agencies and Fire and Rescue services. A number of opportunities for integrated services are being pursued around Estates\n and\n support services but also joining up front line services, particularly around the front office and enforcement activity. A number of bids have been submitted by Avon and Somerset to the Home Office Innovation Fund supporting these various projects. In addition, I have launched jointly with the Constabulary and the Local Criminal Justice Board and Community Safe\nty Partnerships an Integrated Victims S\ntrategy to put the victims at the heart of the response by local agencies to victims of crime.\n&#xa0;\n9.1              \nThe Avon and Somerset PCC is committed to an open and transparent way of working. The PCC website has an ‘Openness’ section which details:\n&#xa0;\nHow taxpayers money is used to make Avon &amp; Som\nerset a safer place to live and \nwork: \n&#xa0;\nHow we make decisions:\n&#xa0;\nReports and Meetings:\n&#xa0;\nAudits and Inspections:\n&#xa0;\nPolice Performance:\n&#xa0;\nOur Policies and procedures:\n&#xa0;\n              \nIn a recent Grant Thornton report the Avon and Somerset OPCC scored 100% in three \nof the four categories\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n10.1              \nI believe that in my first year in office I have made a real difference to reducing crime and addressing Community Safety issues in Avon and Somerset by focussing on the key roles highlighted above. There remains much more to be done and I am comfortable that I will be judged on the success of these various initiatives at the end of my 3 and a half year term. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n11.1 I submit this document as part of my role as Police and Crime Commissioner for Avon and Somerset.\n&#xa0;\nSue Mountstevens\n,\nPolice and Crime Commissioner for Avon &amp; Somerset\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
