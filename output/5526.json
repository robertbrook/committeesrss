"2\n&#xa0;\nBritish Bankers’ Association—Written evidence&#xa0;\nThe British Bankers’ Association’s (‘BBA’) membership includes 240 organisations, of which more than 170 are banks and 70 are providers of professional services. Our member banks make up the world's largest international banking cluster, operating +150 mil\nlion accounts for UK customers and contributing over £50 billion annually to UK economic growth. \n&#xa0;\nThe BBA welcomes the opportunity to contribute to \nth\nis\n inquiry\n.\n On this occasion we have limited our comments to the second part of the inquiry, the ‘\nNew app\nroach to Tax Policy Making\n’.\n &#xa0;\nWe would, of course, be happy to clarify any points raised in these comments.   \n&#xa0;\nNew approach to Tax Policy Making &#xa0;In September 2010, the BBA responded\n \nwarmly to the HM Treasury (‘HMT’) and HM Revenue &amp;\n Customs (‘HMRC’) consultation on ‘Tax policy making: A new approach’, welcoming and endorsing the general approach.\n&#xa0;\n It is still our position that the published 2010 statement should increase confidence in tax policy making through the provision of greate\nr levels of transparency about the rationale and impact of tax policy changes and better consultation.\n&#xa0;\n \nThat policy making approach was complemented by the publication of \nt\nhe Government’s Tax Consultation Framework in March 2011.\n&#xa0;\n The BBA believes that con\nsultation with business, including consultation with representative bodies, is a vital part of effective tax policy making, and that consultation is therefore a key component of the present approach to tax policy making.\n&#xa0;\n The BBA regularly responds to cons\nultations conducted by HMT and HMRC.\n&#xa0;\n We have set out below some comments on the approach to tax policy making that has been conducted since the introduction of that Framework in the light of our experience.\n&#xa0;\nIn the main, the consultation process is workin\ng in a constructive manner, resulting in better final legislation for the benefit of both the Exchequer and business.\n&#xa0;\n We would certainly not wish to see a reduction in the extent of consultation, and believe that further improvements could be made.\n&#xa0;\nAs a \ngeneral matter, where business has concerns with a measure subject to consultation, or with the way a particular measure is being implemented (perhaps because of unintended consequences or the level of the ensuing compliance burden), it can be quite diffic\nult to convince HMRC that change to their original proposal is desirable.\n&#xa0;\n We are also concerned that in cases where HMRC understand the legitimate concerns of business, there is sometimes a preference for addressing this by way of HMRC guidance, rather th\nan by better focussed legislation.\n&#xa0;\nFor many policy developments there is a single consultation, with HMRC summarising their view of the responses made by business and other stakeholders in a “Summary of Responses” document.\n&#xa0;\n This can lead to the publicati\non of draft legislation with little further consultation.\n&#xa0;\n We recommend that, where \nappropriate\n, the Government (or HMRC on their behalf) \nengages in a meaningful dialogue \nwith the respondents to the original consultation \non the conclusions being drawn \nbefo\nre draft legislation is published.\n&#xa0;\n We think this would be particularly valuable in those cases where concerns raised or changes proposed by consultation respondents have been rejected, since it would allow greater opportunity to identify whether alternati\nve approaches might be possible.\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\nFormal HMRC consultation documents usually raise specific questions \nand, in turn, HMRC ‘Summary of Responses’\n documents tend to assess consultation responses by \nreference to those questions.\n&#xa0;\n \nThere can be instances where\n the consultation questions appear predisposed to certain outcomes.\n&#xa0;\n It is therefore sometimes the case that respondents to a consultation wish to comment on matters which are not the subject of a specific set question, or to suggest that the approach need\ns to be reconsidered altogether, or to propose alternatives not included in the consultation.\n&#xa0;\n We think therefore that it would be helpful firstly for all consultations to include a general question inviting comments on any matters related to the consultat\nion that are not covered by the set questions.\n&#xa0;\n Secondly, and more importantly, we believe that the Summary of Responses document should also set out matters raised by respondents which are relevant to the consultation but that are not covered by the set q\nuestions.\n&#xa0;\n HMRC or the Government should also explain why they consider that no action is required to address such additional points, or what action is to be taken, respectively.\n&#xa0;\nWe also believe that other developments connected with the Government’s \npolicy in relation to taxation should be subject to the same consultation requirements as new tax law policy developments.\n&#xa0;\n An example arose in February 2013, which was the consultation on Tax and Procurement involving HMRC and the Cabinet Office, which al\nlowed 14 days for consultation. We do not believe that is sufficient time for adequate or considered consultation, particularly when the proposals were scheduled to take effect within six weeks.\n&#xa0;\nWe note that the Government’s new approach to tax policy mak\ning also led to the establishment of the Tax Professionals Forum.\n&#xa0;\n That Forum has published two reports which we believe \nare helpful contributions\n to the debate around effective tax policy making.\n&#xa0;\n The reports raise a number of constructive comments relati\nng to the manner in which consultations and tax policy developments have been approached.\n&#xa0;\n It is not evident to us whether HMRC or the Government have responded to those reports in any detail, either by way of direct reply or by way of enhancing their cons\nultation process (noting that both reports contain introductory remarks from the Minister which acknowledge the content).\n&#xa0;\n We therefore believe that it would be helpful for the Government to publish a further response to these reports, and to any future si\nmilar reports (or to publicise any response that they have previously made) to explain in more detail how the matters raised have been, or are being, addressed.\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n \nhttp://www.bba.org.uk/download/5633\n \n"
