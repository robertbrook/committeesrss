default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe welcome the Environment
defaultal
default Audit Committee’s decision to launch this inquiry at such an important point in the development of regulations for the new build sector.
default2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Housing Standards Review proposal to repeal the Planning and Energy Act will remove the 
defaultonly policy tool explicitly incentivising on-site renewables in new homes. This tool must remain available to local authorities at least until Building Regulations are sufficiently strong to drive uptake of on-site low carbon and renewable energy production in new homes. In addition, the Code for Sustainable Ho
defaultmes should also remain available until Building Regulations are strengthened.
default3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe are concerned that the level set for Part L Building Regulations of just 6% CO2 reduction for new homes does not set an ambitious enough target and drive the market in this sector. 
default4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNot
default enough evidence has

default of 
defaultbuilding new energy efficient homes and the
default 
defaultfact that the 
defaultcost to retrofit homes 
defaultto a higher efficiency standard is greater than at new build. A higher standard of energy efficient new build is cheaper for the economy overall than building lower cost housing because of the overall energy savings achieved, locked in for the lifetime of the building.

defaultSummary
default7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn July 2013
default, 
defaulta decision was announced to adopt only a 6% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to the 2010 standard under Part L Building Regulations, rather than 
defaultthe ‘
defaulthalfway
default’
default to zero carbons target. This approach is not ambitious enough 
defaultand does 
defaultnot impose strict enough carbon reduction targets to incentivise the integration of on-site renewables (such as solar energy systems, heat pumps and biomass boilers) into new properties.
default8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs a result of this decision, t
defaulthe Plannin
defaultg and Energy Act's ‘Merton Rule’
default is the only policy tool explicitly incentivising on-site renewables in new home
defaults. It
default must remain available to local authorities at 
defaultthe very 
defaultleast until Building Regulations are sufficiently strong to drive uptake of on-site low carbon and renewable energy production in new homes (which will not be befor
defaulte 2016 at the earliest). It is also still
default important 
defaultto
default driv
defaulte
default higher energy efficiency standards as well 
defaultas low carbon and renewable technologies in non-residential buildings, 
defaultand
default some of this is already incentivised through FITs and the RHI.
default9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOne of the main issues is that e
defaultnergy efficiency measures
default and on-site renewables
default are more cost effective to install at construction than retrofit and not driving uptake in new homes will create a legacy of buildings that need to be brought up to standard. Initiatives such as the Green Deal will need to find budget to deal with this legacy.
default10.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBuilding of new homes is seen as
default 
defaultimpor
defaulttant to improve the economy. However, building more homes to a higher energy efficiency standard makes more sense economically. The lower running costs of these buildings and therefore savings to consumers will be locked-in creating an overall net benefit. A benefit that outweighs costs and is cheaper than paying to achieve carbon reduction and renewables targets through bills or taxation.
default11.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMerton Borough Council (on whose initiative the Planning and Energy Act was based) estimate that if applied nationally the Act could save 160,000 tonnes of CO2 annually and contribute to an annual total renewable energy infrastructure industry of £1,125,000,000. Figures that should not be overlooked when considering the repeal of this important Act.
default12.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Code for Sustainable Homes also provides a set of graduated standards for energy and environmental performance that exceed the minimum levels in Building Regulations.
default&#xa0;
defaultDecision making process
default13.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe have heard anecdotal evidence that the decision making process regarding the repeal of the Act was not robust. A Communities and Local Government 
defaulttask group was set up
default,
default with 
defaultrepresentatives 
defaultfrom across industry
default,
default to develop the proposals for the Housing Standards Review. 
defaultThe group met three times
default,
default and at the final meeting in February 2013 the group was
default unable to 
defaultreach any meaningful conclusions. Therefore not all members of this group were supportive of the
default final proposal to abol
defaultish the Planning and Energy Act and consideration was not taken for the views of all those involved in the group. 
defaultImpact on existing commitments 
default14.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn this year’s budget t
defaulthe 
defaultChancellor reaffirmed the Government commitment to Zero Carbon Homes. 
defaultThe Government has made other legally binding commitments on CO2 reduction and Renewable Energy Production. In February 2013, the Prime Minister launched DECC’s Energy Efficiency Mission and 
defaultemphasised 
defaultthe 
defaultimportance of green energy for 
defaultclimate change, the economy and business.
default 
defaultHowever, 
defaultthis is
default not reflected 
defaultin the current Part L standards
default and the proposal to repeal the Planning and Energy Act.
default15.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere will be an immediate impact for many Local Authorities if the act is repealed. For example, t
defaulthe use of the Planning and Energy Act appears in 
defaultthe
default London Plan 
defaultstating
default that all new major residential developments should set energy efficiency standa
defaultrds above current requirements 
defaultand include on-site generation. As a result, 63% of new dwellings in London will have a 
default10% renewable energy in 2014–16, this achievement will be jeopardised of the Act is repealed.
default              
defaultPart L in detail
default16.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA
default more ambitious target 
defaultfor new build under Part L of the building regulations 
defaultwould support industry to develop its supply chain thus driving down costs and 
defaultalso 
defaultencouraging more retrofit installations
default in existing buildings
default. However, because this supply will now take longer to develop, costs will remain higher for longer and as a result consumers are less likely to install retrofit installations. 
default17.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhilst consumers 
defaultin new build homes 
defaultwill benefit from some reduction in their energy bills, up to £200 according to DCLG, the more ambitious target would have created savings up to five times higher. Thus fewer consumers will be protected from rising fuel costs and volatility in pricing. 
default18.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRegulatory burden known as the ‘one in two out’ rule has created a distortion in how the costs and benefits are compared and the resulting savings to the economy. 
defaultAt the level of the economy overall the extra costs of the higher target
default are more than funded by the additional savings and this has not been taken into consideration when creating the regulations. 
default19.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUsing data in the
default 2012 consultation Impact Assessment the cost to society of the ‘halfway’ 
defaultapproach was estimated at £317m. However, the
default analysis did not include the benefits to consumers (£375m). When these figures are included 
defaultin a cost benefit analysis 
defaultthere is a net benefit to society of £58m. An analysis of the final Impact Assessment suggests the net benefit is even greater; the cost to society is 
defaultestimated
default as £311m but the benefits to consumers are £391m giving a net benefit to society of £81m. Furthermore, using 2014 cost assumptions (when the regulations come into 
defaultforces) the cost to society is estimated as 
default£272m giving a net benefit of over £100m
default (see appendix A)
default. 
default20.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe c
defaultosts of creating energy efficient homes are simply being displaced to the future 
defaultat greater cost to consumers and the economy 
defaultand furthermore the costs of retrofit installation will be greater than at new build. Incentives such as the Green Deal and the Renewable Heat Incentive will be required to find additional budget to deal with this legacy cost.
default&#xa0;
defaultWider housing issues
default21.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is recognised that there is a need in the UK to build more new homes and more affordable new homes. 
defaultWe understand there is an argument that in order to ‘kick start’ this market, increased development costs should be avoided.
default22.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, 
defaultthe result of this approach is to not
default accommodate
default the
default building
default of
default more energy efficient homes. This creates legacy costs for Government, dealing with these inefficient homes at a later date. And for consumers, who will be locked into higher energy costs until such time as retrofit improvements can be made, driving more households into fuel poverty.
default23.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthere is evidence available that new homes built to higher energy efficiency
default standards do have an increased value. 
defaultA DECC report published in June 2013, ‘An investigation of the effect of EPC ratings on house prices’, found that: ‘there is a positive relationship between energy rating and dwelling price per square metre. Compared to dwellings rated EPC band G, dwellings with higher EPC ratings have sold at a statistically significant price premium and the pattern of the resul
defaultts is consistent and plausible.’
default 
default24.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is also evidence that 
defaultnew energy efficient 
defaulthomes can be built at low cost and affordable prices. Richard Rogers’ Home Shell, was developed in response to the then Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott’s Design for Manufacture challenge to create a house that could be built 
defaultfrom modern materials for £60,000
default. The building is designed to be energy efficient and a development of such homes has been in existence since 2007.
default&#xa0;
defaultConclusions
default25.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultPart L Building Regulations 
defaultset at just
default 6% CO2 reduction
default, announced in July 
defaultfor new homes
default,
default do
defaultes
default not set an ambitious enough target 
defaultto
default drive the market in this sector. 
default26.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe costs of building new energy efficient homes 
defaultwith on-site renewables 
defaultis cheaper for the economy overall than building lower cost housing because of the overall energy savings achieved, locked in for the lifetime of the building. 
defaultThe lower running costs of energy efficient buildings and therefore savings to consumers create an overall net benefit that outweighs costs and is cheaper than paying to achieve carbon reduction and renewables targets through bills or taxation.
default 
defaultFurthermore the cost to retrofit homes to a higher efficiency standard is greater than at new build.
default27.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTherefore the Planning and Energy Act must remain available to local authorities 
defaultto enable them to drive 
defaultuptake of on-site low carbon and renewable energy production in new homes
default,
default at least until 
defaulttighter standards exist in 
defaultBuilding Regulations.
default In addition, the Code for Sustainable Homes should also remain available until such time as the Building Regulations are strengthened.

default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Bui

default energy profile for different house types to estimate the cost and
default benefits of installing microgeneration 
defaulttechnologies (PV taken as a proxy
default) and energy efficiency measures in new buildings.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUsing data from the 2012 consultation and Parsons Brinkerhoff* solar PV costs, the cost to society of the ‘
defaulthalfwaydefault’ approach was estimated at 
default£317mdefault. The analysis also 
defaultestimated that the policy would result in benefits to consumers of 
default£375mdefault. Therefore a cost benefit analysis

default that there would be a net benefit to society of 
default£58mdefault.
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn the latest analysis the benefits to consumers has increased to 
default£391mdefault 
defaultdue to some 
defaultchanges in the dwelling numbers
default and to a small increase in both gas and electricity emission factor.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe analysis is based on the Green Book 3.5% SDR.
