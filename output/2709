[normal]1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We welcome the Environment
[normal]al
[normal] Audit Committee’s decision to launch this inquiry at such an important point in the development of regulations for the new build sector.
[normal]2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Housing Standards Review proposal to repeal the Planning and Energy Act will remove the 
[normal]only policy tool explicitly incentivising on-site renewables in new homes. This tool must remain available to local authorities at least until Building Regulations are sufficiently strong to drive uptake of on-site low carbon and renewable energy production in new homes. In addition, the Code for Sustainable Ho
[normal]mes should also remain available until Building Regulations are strengthened.
[normal]3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We are concerned that the level set for Part L Building Regulations of just 6% CO2 reduction for new homes does not set an ambitious enough target and drive the market in this sector. 
[normal]4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Not
[normal] enough evidence has
[normal] been explored about the cost
[normal] of 
[normal]building new energy efficient homes and the
[normal] 
[normal]fact that the 
[normal]cost to retrofit homes 
[normal]to a higher efficiency standard is greater than at new build. A higher standard of energy efficient new build is cheaper for the economy overall than building lower cost housing because of the overall energy savings achieved, locked in for the lifetime of the building.

[normal]Summary
[normal]7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In July 2013
[normal], 
[normal]a decision was announced to adopt only a 6% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to the 2010 standard under Part L Building Regulations, rather than 
[normal]the ‘
[normal]halfway
[normal]’
[normal] to zero carbons target. This approach is not ambitious enough 
[normal]and does 
[normal]not impose strict enough carbon reduction targets to incentivise the integration of on-site renewables (such as solar energy systems, heat pumps and biomass boilers) into new properties.
[normal]8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As a result of this decision, t
[normal]he Plannin
[normal]g and Energy Act's ‘Merton Rule’
[normal] is the only policy tool explicitly incentivising on-site renewables in new home
[normal]s. It
[normal] must remain available to local authorities at 
[normal]the very 
[normal]least until Building Regulations are sufficiently strong to drive uptake of on-site low carbon and renewable energy production in new homes (which will not be befor
[normal]e 2016 at the earliest). It is also still
[normal] important 
[normal]to
[normal] driv
[normal]e
[normal] higher energy efficiency standards as well 
[normal]as low carbon and renewable technologies in non-residential buildings, 
[normal]and
[normal] some of this is already incentivised through FITs and the RHI.
[normal]9.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]One of the main issues is that e
[normal]nergy efficiency measures
[normal] and on-site renewables
[normal] are more cost effective to install at construction than retrofit and not driving uptake in new homes will create a legacy of buildings that need to be brought up to standard. Initiatives such as the Green Deal will need to find budget to deal with this legacy.
[normal]10.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Building of new homes is seen as
[normal] 
[normal]impor
[normal]tant to improve the economy. However, building more homes to a higher energy efficiency standard makes more sense economically. The lower running costs of these buildings and therefore savings to consumers will be locked-in creating an overall net benefit. A benefit that outweighs costs and is cheaper than paying to achieve carbon reduction and renewables targets through bills or taxation.
[normal]11.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Merton Borough Council (on whose initiative the Planning and Energy Act was based) estimate that if applied nationally the Act could save 160,000 tonnes of CO2 annually and contribute to an annual total renewable energy infrastructure industry of £1,125,000,000. Figures that should not be overlooked when considering the repeal of this important Act.
[normal]12.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Code for Sustainable Homes also provides a set of graduated standards for energy and environmental performance that exceed the minimum levels in Building Regulations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Decision making process
[normal]13.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We have heard anecdotal evidence that the decision making process regarding the repeal of the Act was not robust. A Communities and Local Government 
[normal]task group was set up
[normal],
[normal] with 
[normal]representatives 
[normal]from across industry
[normal],
[normal] to develop the proposals for the Housing Standards Review. 
[normal]The group met three times
[normal],
[normal] and at the final meeting in February 2013 the group was
[normal] unable to 
[normal]reach any meaningful conclusions. Therefore not all members of this group were supportive of the
[normal] final proposal to abol
[normal]ish the Planning and Energy Act and consideration was not taken for the views of all those involved in the group. 
[normal]Impact on existing commitments 
[normal]14.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In this year’s budget t
[normal]he 
[normal]Chancellor reaffirmed the Government commitment to Zero Carbon Homes. 
[normal]The Government has made other legally binding commitments on CO2 reduction and Renewable Energy Production. In February 2013, the Prime Minister launched DECC’s Energy Efficiency Mission and 
[normal]emphasised 
[normal]the 
[normal]importance of green energy for 
[normal]climate change, the economy and business.
[normal] 
[normal]However, 
[normal]this is
[normal] not reflected 
[normal]in the current Part L standards
[normal] and the proposal to repeal the Planning and Energy Act.
[normal]15.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There will be an immediate impact for many Local Authorities if the act is repealed. For example, t
[normal]he use of the Planning and Energy Act appears in 
[normal]the
[normal] London Plan 
[normal]stating
[normal] that all new major residential developments should set energy efficiency standa
[normal]rds above current requirements 
[normal]and include on-site generation. As a result, 63% of new dwellings in London will have a 
[normal]10% renewable energy in 2014–16, this achievement will be jeopardised of the Act is repealed.
[normal]              
[normal]Part L in detail
[normal]16.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A
[normal] more ambitious target 
[normal]for new build under Part L of the building regulations 
[normal]would support industry to develop its supply chain thus driving down costs and 
[normal]also 
[normal]encouraging more retrofit installations
[normal] in existing buildings
[normal]. However, because this supply will now take longer to develop, costs will remain higher for longer and as a result consumers are less likely to install retrofit installations. 
[normal]17.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Whilst consumers 
[normal]in new build homes 
[normal]will benefit from some reduction in their energy bills, up to £200 according to DCLG, the more ambitious target would have created savings up to five times higher. Thus fewer consumers will be protected from rising fuel costs and volatility in pricing. 
[normal]18.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Regulatory burden known as the ‘one in two out’ rule has created a distortion in how the costs and benefits are compared and the resulting savings to the economy. 
[normal]At the level of the economy overall the extra costs of the higher target
[normal] are more than funded by the additional savings and this has not been taken into consideration when creating the regulations. 
[normal]19.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Using data in the
[normal] 2012 consultation Impact Assessment the cost to society of the ‘halfway’ 
[normal]approach was estimated at £317m. However, the
[normal] analysis did not include the benefits to consumers (£375m). When these figures are included 
[normal]in a cost benefit analysis 
[normal]there is a net benefit to society of £58m. An analysis of the final Impact Assessment suggests the net benefit is even greater; the cost to society is 
[normal]estimated
[normal] as £311m but the benefits to consumers are £391m giving a net benefit to society of £81m. Furthermore, using 2014 cost assumptions (when the regulations come into 
[normal]forces) the cost to society is estimated as 
[normal]£272m giving a net benefit of over £100m
[normal] (see appendix A)
[normal]. 
[normal]20.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The c
[normal]osts of creating energy efficient homes are simply being displaced to the future 
[normal]at greater cost to consumers and the economy 
[normal]and furthermore the costs of retrofit installation will be greater than at new build. Incentives such as the Green Deal and the Renewable Heat Incentive will be required to find additional budget to deal with this legacy cost.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Wider housing issues
[normal]21.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is recognised that there is a need in the UK to build more new homes and more affordable new homes. 
[normal]We understand there is an argument that in order to ‘kick start’ this market, increased development costs should be avoided.
[normal]22.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, 
[normal]the result of this approach is to not
[normal] accommodate
[normal] the
[normal] building
[normal] of
[normal] more energy efficient homes. This creates legacy costs for Government, dealing with these inefficient homes at a later date. And for consumers, who will be locked into higher energy costs until such time as retrofit improvements can be made, driving more households into fuel poverty.
[normal]23.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]here is evidence available that new homes built to higher energy efficiency
[normal] standards do have an increased value. 
[normal]A DECC report published in June 2013, ‘An investigation of the effect of EPC ratings on house prices’, found that: ‘there is a positive relationship between energy rating and dwelling price per square metre. Compared to dwellings rated EPC band G, dwellings with higher EPC ratings have sold at a statistically significant price premium and the pattern of the resul
[normal]ts is consistent and plausible.’
[normal] 
[normal]24.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There is also evidence that 
[normal]new energy efficient 
[normal]homes can be built at low cost and affordable prices. Richard Rogers’ Home Shell, was developed in response to the then Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott’s Design for Manufacture challenge to create a house that could be built 
[normal]from modern materials for £60,000
[normal]. The building is designed to be energy efficient and a development of such homes has been in existence since 2007.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Conclusions
[normal]25.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]Part L Building Regulations 
[normal]set at just
[normal] 6% CO2 reduction
[normal], announced in July 
[normal]for new homes
[normal],
[normal] do
[normal]es
[normal] not set an ambitious enough target 
[normal]to
[normal] drive the market in this sector. 
[normal]26.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The costs of building new energy efficient homes 
[normal]with on-site renewables 
[normal]is cheaper for the economy overall than building lower cost housing because of the overall energy savings achieved, locked in for the lifetime of the building. 
[normal]The lower running costs of energy efficient buildings and therefore savings to consumers create an overall net benefit that outweighs costs and is cheaper than paying to achieve carbon reduction and renewables targets through bills or taxation.
[normal] 
[normal]Furthermore the cost to retrofit homes to a higher efficiency standard is greater than at new build.
[normal]27.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Therefore the Planning and Energy Act must remain available to local authorities 
[normal]to enable them to drive 
[normal]uptake of on-site low carbon and renewable energy production in new homes
[normal],
[normal] at least until 
[normal]tighter standards exist in 
[normal]Building Regulations.
[normal] In addition, the Code for Sustainable Homes should also remain available until such time as the Building Regulations are strengthened.

[normal]Appendix A[bold]Part L Building Regulations: Cost Benefit Analysis
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Bui
[normal]lding Regulations model uses the Zero Carbon Homes
[normal] energy profile for different house types to estimate the cost and
[normal] benefits of installing microgeneration 
[normal]technologies (PV taken as a proxy
[normal]) and energy efficiency measures in new buildings.
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Using data from the 2012 consultation and Parsons Brinkerhoff* solar PV costs, the cost to society of the ‘
[normal]halfway[bold]’ approach was estimated at 
[normal]£317m[bold]. The analysis also 
[normal]estimated that the policy would result in benefits to consumers of 
[normal]£375m[bold]. Therefore a cost benefit analysis
[normal] suggest
[normal]s
[normal] that there would be a net benefit to society of 
[normal]£58m[bold].
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In the latest analysis the benefits to consumers has increased to 
[normal]£391m[bold] 
[normal]due to some 
[normal]changes in the dwelling numbers
[normal] and to a small increase in both gas and electricity emission factor. 
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The analysis is based on the Green Book 3.5% SDR. 
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]£311m[bold] is the cost of installing PV systems in new buildings using Parsons Brinckerhoff 2012 estimates (in line with DCLG September 2013 IA).
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]£272m[bold] would be the cost of installing PVs if Parsons Brinckerhoff 2014 cost estimates were input in the model.
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]£391m [bold]is the household savings using DCLG September 2013 revised dwelling assumptions
[normal].
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Therefore
[normal] [bold]£119m [bold]is the net benefit
[normal] [bold](or 
[normal]£81m [bold]using the 2012 figures)
