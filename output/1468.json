"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Society of Biology (RaD0008)&#xa0;\nThe Society of Biology\n welcomes the Committee’s attention to \nresearch and \ndevelopment\n fund\ning for science and technology; a core sector that\n underpins the UK’s economic stability through n\novel products and job creation, and is pleased to have sight of the detailed analysis in the National Audit Office memorandum on this topic. \n&#xa0;\nThe NAO\n memorandum confirms\n the value of R&amp;D carried out by UK business, where the life science\ns play a major role and\n biotechnolo\ngy and pharmaceutical companies are \nthe dominating sectors. \nThe UK business R\n&amp;\nD spend, for which tax incentives are so import\nant, is bolstered by our particular strengths in \nlife sciences, \nsoftware, \nand \nadvanced engineering research \nthat\n attract \nsubstantial\n Foreign Direct Investment\n. The UK’s talent and attractive research environment is strengthened \nby \nBIS\n’s commitment\n to improve the interface betwee\nn Higher Education Institutions \nand businesses, and supportive statements by \nG\novernment that \n'investment in science is an investment in our future\n’\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nAt both the 2010 and 2013 spending reviews\n, Government \nrecognised the sustained excellence of the science sector with a \nflat\n cash \nsettlement for the resource budget. Although we welcomed the ring fence, \nwe note that \nif the Government want\ns a growth economy, it must support a sector that employs more than \n5.4m \nUK workers\n and provides \nan impressive return on investment.\n A\nbove inflation growth in the science budget is \ntherefore \nneeded if the sciences are to deliver their full potential for improving the economy and wellbeing. It is essential that the virtual cuts\n in the science budget are reversed if the research community is to deliver the full benefit the country needs.\n \n&#xa0;\nThe UK is currently the number one in Europe in terms of Foreign Direct Investment, but maintaining our i\nnternational competitively is crucial, \nparticularly\n as the global economy changes \nand\n BRIC \nnations advance. \n \nThe NAO memorandum clearly shows that the UK is falling behind on\n \nR&amp;D intensity at just 1.9%, way off the 3% target for \nthe European Commission by \n2020.  \nThe UK’s failure to \naim for\n this target is concerning and contradictory to Government rhetoric on the importance of the UK science sector.\n&#xa0;\nGovernment Departments have a key role in funding research outside of public labs, and should be seen as an i\nntegral part of the UK’s research ecosystem.  This area of funding has been severely hit by recent cuts, creating concern about training, skills development and policy- relevant research across the sciences. These budgets should also be taken into consider\nation when investigating the resilience of the UK science sector. \n&#xa0;Public Sector Research Establishments (PSREs)Certain PRSEs carry out a range of vital services across the life sciences, and provide essential expertise for increasingly complex and \nrelevant policy issues including human health, the agriculture sector and sustainable food provision, the green economy and national safety:\nFuture InquiriesThere are several lines of inquiry that the Select Committee may like to consider which would be beneficial to the UK \nscience R\n&amp;\nD sector. The Society of Biology suggests the following:\n \nRecently Government has increased capital funding though specific infrastructure announcements such as  the £50m for a National Graphene Institute, inv\nestment in scientifi\nc facilities, including The Francis Crick Institute and Pharmavision,  and £150 million of capital investment in 2015-16 to fund health research infrastructure in the areas of dementia, genomics and imaging. Funding is also promised for the ‘Great Eight’ t\nechnologies for which analysis has suggested Government should be promoting with further capital investment and technology support\n. R&amp;D funding is welcome where it is needed and of most use, but does this shift toward directed funding conflict with the es\ntablished Haldane Principle? The Chancellor stated in his 2013 Spending Review announcement: \n‘\nOur philosophy is simple: trust people to make their own decisions and they will usually make better ones’\n.\n \nWhat are the processes for deciding the allocation of \ncapital funding? How should this best integrate with the Research Council’s remit and activities?\nThe pharmaceutical \ns\nector is a key driver for innovation in the UK, however o\nver recent years pharmaceutical R&amp;D within the UK has \nundergone a significant transformation. An ecosystem of collaborative research partners is emerging which encompasses small and large pharma, SMEs, academia, health charities and the NHS, with each contributing complementary skills and expertise. Job losse\ns at UK sites for GSK, AstraZeneca and Pfizer in recent years \ncannot be ignored. What is the future for UK Pharma, and how can the Government ensure its continued success?\nThe BIS R&amp;D Scoreboards were \ndiscontinued in 2012 because of budgetary concerns. These scoreboards allowed for transparent, impartial and up to date evaluation of the level of R&amp;D activity in the UK, tracking of historical data trends and benchmarking of UK R&amp;D activity against other \nnations. Given global fiscal uncertainty, we argue that this type of analysis firms up policy decision making, and \ncould help to inform and encourage \n investment in \nthe \nUK by highlighting our strengths and allowing for closer inspection of where policies a\nre, or are not working. How has the discontinuation affected the ability for Government and others to track policy and investment efficacy? Has this type of analysis been picked up elsewhere, and if so, \nto what budgetary costs?\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n              \n \nDepartment for Business Innovation and Skills \nLeverage from public funding of science and research\n.
