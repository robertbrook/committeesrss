"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Dr Neil T. Gavin, The University of Liverpool (CLC026)&#xa0;\n1.\n              \nExecutive summary&#xa0;\n1.1\n              \nCurrent research gives us limited understanding of \nhow \nthe structure and content of \nmedia \ncoverage impinges on public understanding of climate change.\n \nW\nork done \no\nn television\n coverage – the public’s most trusted and most used source of information – has \nbeen undertaken\n by \nthis submission’s \nauthor\n. I\nt illuminates a set of worrying patterns that are under-explored by principal funders of research.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n              \nUnique research undertaken by the author suggests televisual coverage \nof climate change has diminished. But such coverage as there is \nhas a measurable influence on the emphasis that citizens place on the topic as a significant issue facing Britain. This \n‘salience’ \nis an important precursor to further public engagement, but needs to be viewed in the light of climate sceptic\n coverage\n (a topic also under-explored in research)\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n              \nThis\n submission suggests that the main research funders need encourage\nment\n to support \nwork that \nintegrat\nes\n of research on public attitude formation\n (heavily funded)\n, with long-term assessments o\nf press and television coverage of climate change.\n&#xa0;\n1.4\n              \nBroadcasters in both the non-commercial and commercial sectors need to be challenged on the emphasis place\nd\n on documenting climate change. In addition, senior government \npoliticians \nought to be challenged on the extent to which they are prepared to invest political capital in raising the profile of climate change. Finally, \npress \neditors should be challenged on the\nir\n rationale \nfor \ncontinued emphasis on climate sceptic\nism\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.\n              \nIntroduction&#xa0;\n2.\n1\n              \nThis evidence is \nbased on \nthe author’s extensive contribution to \npolitical communication \nresearch. Th\nis straddles \nclimate-related public relations, the coverage of climate change in all significant media (press, television and the internet),\n1\n and the media’s impact on public attitu\nd\nes.\n2\n The author of this \nis \nalso currently Convenor of the Media, Communication and Cultural Studies Association’s ‘Climate Change, Environment and Sustainability network, an umbrella organisation for scholars research\ning\n environmental issues.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nThe evidence is also given against \na \nbackground of ongoing \nexploratory \nresearch on climate change coverage\n’s impact\n on public attitudes, \nand \nthe incidence of climate sceptic coverage in the \nBritish \npress.\n3\n&#xa0;\n3.\n              \nFactual Information&#xa0;\n              \nBackground\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n              \nT\nhe press is currently taking a diminishing interest in climate (\nsee \nFigure 3.1).\n This is worryingly consistent with the rise, plateau and decline pattern outlined in ‘issue attention cycle’ thesis, with we may well be at a phase characterised by declining interest and a ‘post-problem’ mentality.\n4\n Here, spikes around the Copenhagen conference and recently, are not necessarily reassuring, as they may represent the ‘spasmodic recurrence’ of attention allowed for in this perspective. In addition, this overarching pattern cannot be looked at in isolation from the much, much larger quantity of coverage that bears on non-climate, ‘bread-and-butter’ issues, like crime, health and economics.\n1\n&#xa0;\n              \nFigure 3.1\n UK Press Stories Containing ‘Climate’\n              \n              \n              \nSource: \nhttp://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/media_coverage/uk/index.html\n&#xa0;\n              \n3.2\n              \nThe \nunderlying structure \nof this coverage \nhas some features that are \nwell established\n. First, the broadsheet \n(and notably \nthe Guardian and Independent\n)\n make a\n very\n notable contribution. Second, \nbroadsheet \ncoverage has a sophisticated take on climate change, with sceptical messages\n, according to some assessments,\n much less apparent than they were.\n5\n \nThird, \nthe high circulation mid-market and tabloid press takes a lesser interest\n, but \nth\ne tabloid\n \nin particular are \nnot trusted, nor \nare they \ncited \nby citizens \nas their principal \ninformation \nsource\n. \nNevertheless, the \nwider \nliterature \non ‘media effects’ \nsuggests that \nbroadsheet\ns\n and \nthe mid-market ‘\nblack top\n’\n \ntitles \nha\nve\n the \npotential\n to influence public appreciat\nion of \nclimate change.\n2\n \nOther \nwork \non public perceptions of the climate commentary \nsuggests the \ncitizens \ncite the media as a source of climate information, talk to family and friends about \nsuch \ncoverage, but nevertheless continue to dispute \nglobal warming’s \nanthropogenic basis, and are still confused about the science.\n6\n&#xa0;\n3.\n3\n              \nWhat is much \nless\n well-understood, is how \ntelevision \nwhich \nis\n trusted use\nd\n as a \nreliable information\n, refract\ns\n climate issues. The author’s research suggest that even at significant ‘moments’ for climate change (such as Copenhagen, 2009), television \nnews\n coverage \nis \nquite modest, a \nhistorical \npattern \nnoted by others\n.\n7\n \nIt \nalso suggest\ned\n that climate sceptic messages \nare \nmore prominent than \nis commonly acknowledged, or \nhealthy. \nHowever\n, there is very little research that deals \ndirectly\n with the impact of \nsuch \ncoverage.\n6\n \n&#xa0;\n3.4\n              \nSome c\nurrent research has sought to \nupdate what the public think about climate change, and how this relate\ns\n to media representations\n, sponsored by UKERC and by a combination of NERC, DECC and Defra\n.\n8\n However, solid as \nthis work is\n, \nit suffers \nin \nsome \nimportant respect\ns. \nThe focus is primarily on attitudes and attitude development. But \nit \nis not \nclosely \narticulat\ned\n to \nan assessment of the \nlong-term \npatterning of \ncoverage\n across \nall\n media\n (especially\n, though not exclusively,\n with regard to \nTV coverage\n,\n \nor \nthe prevalence of climate sceptic messages\n across \nthe \nmedia\n).\n \nFinally, \nwith a reliance on focus group\n techniques\n \nit \ndoes not \nexplore the \nfull range of ways in which ‘media impact’ is \ngenerally \nconceived and evidenced.\n&#xa0;\n              \nRecent \nresearch\n \n&#xa0;\n3\n.\n5\n              \nWhat little work that has been done on TV documentary coverage of climate c\nhange, has been conducted by this\n \nsubmission’s \nauthor.\n1\n \nThis \ngenre is \nimportant\n. I\nt \nis \na source citizens trust, and documentaries \ncan \ngive sustained attention to the issue \nlacking in \nnew\ns\n bulletins. \nAn ongoing \nand exhaustive \nsurvey of\n climate documentary \n \nprogramming \nshows the same \ngeneral\n structure as press\n coverage – a \nrise, plateau\n, then\n decline (see Figure \n3\n.\n2\n \nbelow, \nand Appendix\n).\n \nIt is noteworthy that, like press coverage, the greatest emphasis came at a time when the Prime Minister, Chancellor and \nDECC \nMinister all strove \npersistently \nto \nmake \nclimate \nchange \na high profile issue at the heart of government (\nwith \nOpposition leader\ns\n compelled to position \nthemselves \naccordingly). The current situation has seen both a drop in press and television coverage, \nat a time when \nclimate change \nis \ngiven a much lower profile by \nsignificant figures in \nthe government.\n&#xa0;\n              \nFigure \n3\n.\n2\n Year-on\n-\nyear documentary coverage of climate change\n&#xa0;\n              \n&#xa0;\n3.6\n              \nThe \nstructure \nof documentary coverage \nis \nconcerning\n for a number of reasons. \nFirst, the vast bulk of these documentaries are\n on BBC,\n \nnot\n \nthe \ncommercial\n channels\n. This \nis \nunderstandable, if commercial broadcasters consider this form of programming \nun\nlikely to draw \nlarge \naudience, and hence \ngenerate \nlimited \nadvertising revenue. \nBut this \nperhaps \nconsign\ns\n \ntheir duty to keep the public informed about one of the most commanding issues of our generation, \nto a \nsecond-order \npriority\n. \nSecond\n, of the last three documentaries, only one \nwas \non \nBBC1\n. Before th\nis\n, \nthere was only \none in late 2009 and \nanother in \nmid-2010\n. T\nhe rest \npredate March 2007.\nThis \ntoo \nis significant. \nBBC1 is \nthe \nplace where viewers \nare most likely to \nencounter documentar\nies\n. They\n watch\n \naround \n9.8 hours per year on \nBBC1\n,\n8\n \ns\no a drop of\nf\n here is potentially significant\n for audience exposure to the issue\n. ITV1 is next in line\n, with the\n public watching \n3.8\n hours per year\n on this channel\n – a considerable way behind\n. \nBut a\nlthough the last two \ndocumentaries we\nre on ITV1, there were \nno\n others\n in our inventory\n. \nAgain, \naudience \nexposure to climate change (or, rather, \nits absence\n) is an issue here. \nFinally, \nthe vast bulk of documentaries were on \nniche\n channels\n \ncharacterised by low audience\ns\n \n(BBC2, BBC3, BBC4, and\n to a much lesser extent, on\n their commercial counterparts)\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.\n7\n              \nThis picture is significant in itself, but more so in \nview \nof recent exploratory research undertaken \nby th\nis submission’s \nauthor\n,\n \non the \nmedia’s \nso-called ‘agenda-setting’ role\n – \nwhere \nthey \npossess the power to direct \ncitizen \nattention to particular issues, \nvia\n the quantity of coverage. Th\neir\n output \ninfluence\ns\n the extent to which citizens consider \nan \nissue \na significant \none \nfacing the country\n (\nits \n‘\nsalience\n’\n)\n. The analysis\n \nexplored \nthe period between 2000 and late 2007\n,\n \nbefore \n‘the economy’ began to dominate\n political,\n media and public agendas. \nUnlike Figure 3.1, i\nt \nonly \ntracked \npress \nstories where climate figured in \nheadlines\n. In addition, \nit \ndifferentiated between \nstories \nfrom \nthe broadsheets, the mid-market ‘black tops’\n (Mail/Express),\n and the ‘red top’ tabloids\n, \nand \nenter\ned\n them \nseparately\n in the model\n. \nA \nnumber of political events \n(such as 9/11 and Gulf War 2) \nalso \nfigured \nin the\n assessment\n, to determine if they had an\ny\n \nrole \nin distracting \ncitizens \nfrom environmental issues. Finally, and uniquely, our analysis factor\ned\n in the \nFigure 3\n.\n2\n’s \ndocumentaries. But\n, in\n \naddit\ni\non\n,\n a \nseparate\n variable was entered for \nt\nhe \n‘\nGreat Global Warming Swindle’\n documentary\n, because\n – unlike \nall \nothers \n– \nits \nhighly controversial \nmessage was unequivocally \nat odds with the scientific consensus\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.8\n              \nThe results suggest that only broadsheet coverage had an impact on \n‘\nsalience\n’\n.\n There was no such impact for \neither \nthe ‘black tops’ or ‘red tops’, nor did the political event variables achieve statistical significance\n. But importantly there was an interaction effect between broadsheet coverage and documentary coverage\n: \nin effect, the two mediums \nconjoin\n to produce a greater influence on salience, than the broadsheet press would on its own. \nA\nddition\nally\n, the ‘Great Global Warming Swindle’ had a\nn independent,\n measurable and statistically significant impact \nin \nlowering\n salience\n. This\n \nparticular \nfinding \nis un\nsurprising \nin \nsome \nrespect\ns\n. ‘Swindle\n’s highly controversial nature helped generate an audience of near\nly\n two million, in all likelihood far beyond that of many (if not all) the other documentaries\n. In addition, it generated supportive commentary in the Telegraph and \nthe \nblack top press\n.\n1\n But\n,\n if \nun\nsurprising, \nthe finding \nis \nstill \nworrying, given its \npotent \ncounter-consensus message.\n The results underscore the problematic nature of Channel 4’s defence of its broadcast, on the grounds that it \nbalanced\n a portfolio of environmental output which also contained material \nconsistent \nwith the scientific consensus.\n9\n \n&#xa0;\n3.9\n              \nGiven the findings, it is no surprise that with climate change now diminished in press coverage (Figure 3.1), and documentary coverage dwindling (Figure 4.1), the salience of the environment is at a record and worrying low, and on a sharp downward track.\n 10\n \nBut another feature of ongoing research \non the British press \nis pertinent here. It \nhas t\nr\nacked climate sceptic messages in our national newspapers, and \nsuggests unchallenged \ncontrarian \ncommentary is still persistent in \na \nbroadsheet \npress that helps drive the salience of climate (notably in the Telegraph), and in \na \nblack top press that so conspicuously supported the ‘Great Global Warming Swindle’ documentary.\n3\n&#xa0;\n4.0\n              \nConclusions&#xa0;\n4\n.\n1\n              \nFrom \nth\ne \nperspective\n of the evidence presented here\n, the picture is concern\ning\n. It invites us to consider \na number of \ninterrelated \nissues. \nTo what extent do we need a research agenda that takes into consideration the structure of climate change coverage in the widest possible range of media? Do we need to find a way to integrate existing research on climate attitudes and attitude development, with a fuller appreciation of these structures. And to what extent do the principal funders of such research need to \nbe encouraged to \nacknowledge \nsuch \nissues?\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n              \nIn addition, there are questions for the broadcasters\n and for the press\n. Given the remit \nof the former \nto educate and inform the public, h\now \nfar \nare they prepared to \ngo to \ndocument \nclimate \nchange \nin the future?\n \nW\nill \nth\neir\n output reflect the urgency the scientific com\nmunity express about the issue\n, and will this be tempered significantly by concerns about audience figures and advertising revenue\n? \nAnd t\no what extent will \ncounter-consensus messages like that embodied in the ‘Great Global Warming Swindle’\n be given a place in broadcasting output?\n For \nnewspaper \neditors, some of the same themes emerge. Although, the press acknowledge no obligation to inform or educate the public, they should perhaps consider more fully than they do at present, the potential impact their coverage has, and the extent to which it serves the public good.\n&#xa0;\n4.3\n              \nFinally, what role do senior government politicians have in heightening the media profile of climate change? \nThe media often take their cue on what is important from these figures. \nHere\n,\n the issue of political leadership \ncomes \nto the forefront.\n&#xa0;\n              \nDeclaration\n&#xa0;\n              \nThe author of this evidence declares no conflict of interest in its presentation.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nApril 2013\nNotes\n&#xa0;\n1\n              \nGavin, N.T.
