[normal]Written evidence from Private Eye (GMC0018)[bold]EVIDENCE SUBMITTED BY [bold]DR [bold]PHIL HAMMOND [bold]AND [bold]ANDREW BOUSFIELD[bold]The purpose of this submission to the Health Select Committee is to demonstrate that the Committee can have little [bold]confidence in the GMC's regulation of its doctors[bold] or its commitment to systems of safe care[bold].[bold]In the wake of the Mid-Staffs Inquiry the Secretary of State has made his expectations clear.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] He expects there to be a new culture of openness and transparency wi
[normal]th 
[normal]a 
[normal]commitment to candour 
[normal]by staff and organisations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] He expects regulators such as the GMC to hold staff to account.
[normal]This submission will show that at its first key test
[normal],
[normal] the GMC has failed to meet these expectations it and that its disciplinary arrangements
[normal] are not fit for purpose
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]On July 29, 2012, w
[normal]e referred Dr 
[normal]Hakin
[normal],
[normal] currently Deputy Chief Executive of the Commissioning Board and previous Chief Executive of East Mid
[normal]lands Strategic Health Authority to the GMC for her conduct in relation to United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust
[normal] (ULHT)
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The GMC have a key disciplinary role in relation to doctors in management.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The complaint was wide ranging.
[normal]At the heart of our comp
[normal]laint was 
[normal]the requirement
[normal] of doctors 
[normal]to put patient safety first
[normal] and the potential conflict between targets and safety
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]The GMC 
[normal]would seem to condone the mindless pursuit of targets
[normal] and its analysis of our complaint and response from the GMC 
[normal]on October 25
[normal], 2013 
[normal]does not reflect the learning from Mid Staffordshire
[normal].
[normal]  The GMC 
[normal]accepts in 
[normal]the
[normal]ir
[normal] report that there is no dichotomy between targets and safety.  Whilst that may be applicable in well funded, well staffed health systems with ample capacity it clearly c
[normal]annot be said of health systems such as those of Mid Staffordshire or Lincolnshire which were under severe pressure.  Indeed the first investigation into Mid Staffs highlighted the conflict between targets and safety and recommended that Boards:
[normal]ensure tha[bold]t a focus on elective work and targets is not to the detriment of emergency admissions[bold]The GMC found that in those parts of 
[normal]our
[normal] allegations dealing with inappropriate pressure on staff there was generally insufficient evidence to have a realistic prospect of successful if the GMC moved to a disciplinary hearing.
[normal]However our complaints were much wider than 
[normal]‘bullying’
[normal] and encompasse
[normal]d allegations of the pursuit of targets in overfull hospitals and that as a result patients came to harm.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The GMC’s analysis 
[normal]of 
[normal]Dr 
[normal]Hakin
[normal]’
[normal]s
[normal] response
[normal] to these 
[normal]allegations 
[normal]can be 
[normal]broadly 
[normal]summarised
[normal] by four assertions
[normal]:
[normal]The 
[normal]GMC had ample evidence to refute all of these assertions.
[normal]Based upon 
[normal]its
[normal] 
[normal]flawed analysis and 
[normal]untested 
[normal]assertions the GMC concluded that 
[normal]for that part of our complaint, 
[normal]allegations of the pursuit of targets in overfull hospitals result
[normal]ing in patients 
[normal]coming
[normal] to harm
[normal], t
[normal]here was 
[normal]also 
[normal]no realistic prospect of pursuing Dr Hakin.
[normal]The Committee will be aware that 
[normal]ULHT has been described by Prof Sir Brian 
[normal]Jarman
[normal] as ‘similar to Mid-Staffordshire’
[normal] an
[normal]d
[normal] so these matters are important
[normal].
[normal]  They are also important as the case involves one of the most senior doctors in 
[normal]NHS 
[normal]management who should set an example to others.  
[normal]The quality of the investigation carried out by the GMC can give little confidence that the GMC as an organisation is cap
[normal]able of responding effectively to the expectations of the Secretary of State.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Not only were there a number of serious procedural defects and flaws in the investigation carried out, its findings and conclusions were 
[normal]not 
[normal]consistent with the evidence before 
[normal]it.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]We attach a critique of the
[normal] GMC
[normal] investigation at 
[normal]Annex A
[normal] [bold]focussing in on the four false assertions above.
[normal]One of the procedural defects by the GMC was that it failed to show us, the complainants, the evidence put forward by Dr 
[normal]Hakin
[normal] and as such it wa
[normal]s not challenged.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] If the GMC report accurately reflects Dr 
[normal]Hakin
[normal]’
[normal]s
[normal] evidence then 
[normal]we strongly contest it. 
[normal]The failure of the GMC to comply with one of the most basic rules of an investigation and share with us conflicting evidence
[normal],
[normal] as part of the inquiry p
[normal]rocess
[normal],
[normal] is
[normal] merely one of the grounds for 
[normal]considering 
[normal]seeking a Judicial Review of their decision.
[normal]  Indeed
[normal] we have been informed that the GMC
[normal] would normally share controversial and conflicting evidence and have given us no reason for not doing so in this case.  We would only note th
[normal]at the complaint concerned one o
[normal]f its most senior members.
[normal]Finally we 
[normal]are
[normal] 
[normal]also 
[normal]considering 
[normal]making a further compla
[normal]int to the GMC that
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]on the assumption that 
[normal]their analysis of Dr 
[normal]Hakin’s
[normal] response 
[normal]is correct
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]she 
[normal]may have 
[normal]misled them. Whilst this submission is designed to inform the Health Select Committee in its annual review of the GMC
[normal],
[normal] we are conscious that the evid
[normal]ence before you should cause concern about the leadership at the top of the NHS
[normal] and the unlikelihood of 
[normal]the 
[normal]desired change 
[normal]to a safer, kinder culture 
[normal]whilst that leadership persists. 
[normal]The GMC process 
[normal]is 
[normal]in our view 
[normal]unkind, 
[normal]untimely, unfair, 
[normal]inefficient
[normal] and fails to protect patients
[normal] or 
[normal]adequately 
[normal]consider the emotional health of those referred. 
[normal]Over two years ago, 
[normal]w
[normal]e 
[normal]r
[normal]eported the medical director of Great Ormond Street Hospital to the GMC for failing to act on the concerns of Baby Peter whistleblower Dr 
[normal]Kim Holt. The GMC
[normal] is
[normal] still investigating, 
[normal]apparently 
[normal]hampered by the lack of an independent expert. 
[normal]The GMC also does not appear to be proactive, relying on others making referrals to it rather than acting on media reports. The article that gave rise to bo
[normal]th these referrals is authored and attached, and yet despite the grave allegations the GMC has never contacted us proactively for information. Our published response to their assessment of Dr Hakin’s referral is also attached. 
[normal]Finally, in investigating th
[normal]is matter the GMC instructed outside solicitors, Field Fisher Waterhouse, no doubt at great expense.  However, this has another benefit for the GMC.  It means that all communication in pursuance of the investigation is covered by legal professional privile
[normal]ge, and therefore not susceptible to a freedom of information request, or perhaps even Parliamentary scrutiny.  Whilst it is reasonable to instruct lawyers if required to collate evidence, it should not be used to impede proper accountability
[normal].
[normal]December 2013
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Annex A[bold]Failure of the GMC to respond to the evidence which has emerged from Mid Staffordshire and to challenge effectively [bold]evidence[bold] by Dr Hakin in their preliminary investigation into her conduct.[bold]As we were not shown Dr Hakin
[normal]’
[normal]s evidence the comments which follow
[normal] 
[normal]about Dr Hakin 
[normal]are made 
[normal]in good faith and 
[normal]on the basis that they may be reasonably deduced from the GMC report
[normal] of her evidence.
[normal]1[bold].[bold]  [bold]The first assertion is that ULHT was no different to any other hospital, there was nothing unusual in Lincolnshire in terms[bold] of demand or capacity which would have warranted [bold]Dr Hakin[bold] not insisting on targets being met.[bold]&#xa0;[bold] [bold]Analysis of the report shows:
[normal]The implication
[normal] of Dr Hakin
[normal]’
[normal]s evidence is that
[normal] ‘
[normal]The demands and pressures on the Trust to perform better were reasonable
[normal]’
[normal].
[normal]The 
[normal]GMC conclude ‘..
[normal]there is no evidence that the SHA could or should have allowed the Trust to derogate because of the demand and capacity problems
[normal]’
[normal]It is difficult to conclude other than such 
[normal]analysis is incompetent.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Dr 
[normal]Hakin
[normal] is aware of the following
[normal]:
[normal] 
[normal]This is a very significant point as Dr [bold]Hakin[bold]’[bold]s[bold] assertion that there was nothing unusual in Lincolnshire is then used to justify her other actions.[bold]The GMC had before it reports that ULHT was unusual due to 
[normal]its
[normal] geography, witness statements confirming that new 
[normal]wards
[normal] were to be built, data from Prof Sir Brian 
[normal]Jarman
[normal] showing that 
[normal]Lincolnshire’s
[normal] hospitals had significantly less available capacity to meet
[normal] additional demand and reports fr
[normal]om
[normal] staff of the 
[normal]EMSHA
[normal] expressing safety concerns arising from the 
[normal]hospitals
[normal] being overfull.
[normal]Comments on Dr [bold]Hakin[bold]If Dr Hakin 
[normal]assert
[normal]ed
[normal] that there was nothing different in terms of demand and capacity 
[normal]in Lincolnshire it would 
[normal]in our view 
[normal]be de
[normal]ceitful and fall far short of the candour the Secretary of State is entitled to expect from a senior official.
[normal]  There are few hospitals in the country where the position was so dire that additional wards had to be 
[normal]built as a result of the PCT failing to reduce demand in accordance with its plans.
[normal]Comments on the GMC[bold]The GMC had significant evidence before it to show that there were 
[normal]severe 
[normal]demand
[normal] and capacity issues at ULHT
[normal] and were of such magnitude that additional 
[normal]wards were to be built and were therefore were significantly worse than elsewhere
[normal].
[normal]The failure to recognise this is gross incompetence on behalf of the GMC but worse still it makes their remaining analysis fundamentally flawed
[normal] as all of the rest of their a
[normal]nalysis is based upon ULHT not having 
[normal]exceptional 
[normal]capacity and demand problems
[normal].
[normal]2[bold].[bold]  [bold]The second assertion in her defence, D[bold]r Hakin[bold] has claimed that all she was doing was following government policy and that as such she could not countenance any hospital failing to meet its targets.[bold]&#xa0;[bold] [bold]In March 2009 
[normal]Dr 
[normal]Hakin sent an e mail to all East Midlands chief executives stating 
[normal]‘I need to make i
[normal]t very clear that I expect you personally to ensure that your organisations deliver 100% for the next three weeks.... We cannot afford even one day when one single organisation falters.’
[normal] 
[normal]The GMC report states
[normal]“
[normal]Her [Dr Hakin] argument is that safety and ta
[normal]rgets are inextricably linked and the complaint is based on a false dichotomy between the two
[normal].
[normal]She says she was accountable to the Chief Executive of the NHS, who in turn was accountable to the Secretary of State for compliance with targets, and that allow
[normal]ing Mr Walker's failure to meet the targets to go unchallenged would have been a breach of her statutory obligations, a dereliction of her duties as a doctor and denied patients' rights.
[normal]'as a matter of basic common sense, it is inconceivable that an SHA C
[normal]hairman could reasonably agree with a request from a Trust Chairman to objectives which envisage local abrogation of national targets', which she says would have disadvantaged patients in the area
[normal].
[normal]”
[normal]This 
[normal]misrepresents the arrangements that were in place.  
[normal]It was never intended that all hospitals [bold]be required to [bold]meet [bold]all [bold]targets [bold]at all times [bold]regardless of the circumstances.[bold]  
[normal]I
[normal]t was policy under a published Code of C
[normal]onduct that if a hospital ha
[normal]d
[normal] met more than
[normal] its contracted demand and cannot continue to meet t
[normal]argets, then
[normal] under a so called Capacity Review’ 
[normal]the requirement to meet targets is temporarily suspended until for example new capacity can be built or other arrangements made.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] This 
[normal]interpretation
[normal] of the Code
[normal] has been confirmed 
[normal]in writing 
[normal]by the D
[normal]o
[normal]H.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] D
[normal]r 
[normal]Hakin appears to have 
[normal]wilfully ignored this 
[normal]Code 
[normal]and led others to believe that her demand to meet targets was consistent with government policy 
[normal]and the arrangements in force 
[normal]when it was not. 
[normal]Wors
[normal]e
[normal] still given the learning from Mid Staffordshire
[normal],
[normal] it is ex
[normal]traordinary that such a senior public official could take such a stance with hospitals so overcrowded and under pressure that there
[normal] was a
[normal] plan to build new wards.
[normal]Comment on [bold]Hakin[bold]D
[normal]r
[normal] Hakin by both ignoring the Code of Conduct on Capacity Reviews
[normal] 
[normal]and the fa
[normal]ct that the position at ULHT was such that 
[normal]a Capacity R
[normal]eview
[normal] (
[normal]which would have resulted in the temporary suspension to meet targets
[normal])
[normal] would be warranted
[normal], appears to have
[normal] misled the GMC investigation
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]Comment on the GMC[bold]The analysis by the GMC 
[normal]in accepting Dr Hakin’s evidence 
[normal]was incompetent.  It had 
[normal]received 
[normal]from witnesses explanations of what should happen in these circumstances and documents from the DoH confirming that targets should be temporarily suspended
[normal] when Capacity Reviews are warrant
[normal]ed
[normal].  It also had data showing that the contractual situation at ULHT wo
[normal]uld have more than justified a Capacity R
[normal]eview
[normal] and the suspension of targets
[normal].
[normal]3[bold].[bold]  [bold]The third assertion [bold]is [bold]that [bold]a C[bold]a[bold]pacity R[bold]eview [bold]which would have [bold]t[bold]o a[bold]llow a derogation of targets was[bold] not [bold]blocked[bold] by [bold]Dr Hakin[bold], and was[bold] not in any case warranted[bold].[bold]The report states:
[normal]“
[normal]Mr Bowles 
[normal][the Chair of ULHT] 
[normal]refers to raising a capacity review with both the PCT and the SHA and that there was an "absolute flat out refusal', though he provides no evidence of the request to or the refusal by the SHA. Nonetheless, his evidence provides some limited support to the 
[normal]alleged fact of the refusal but no support as to the involvement of Dr Hakin.
[normal]”
[normal] 
[normal]It then however says the evidence of Dr Hakin
[normal] about this matter was:
[normal]“
[normal]as a matter of basic common sense, it is inconceivable that an SHA Chairman could reasonably agree with a 
[normal]request from a Trust Chairman to objectives which envisage local abrogation of national targets', which she says would have disadvantaged patients in the area
[normal] 
[normal]…..
[normal]”
[normal]The GMC report is internally inconsistent.  On the one ha
[normal]n
[normal]d
[normal],
[normal] it sa
[normal]y
[normal]s there is little evidenc
[normal]e of Dr Hakin’s refusal to support a Capacity Review but then contains evidence
[normal] from Dr Hakin 
[normal] that she would not support a abrogation of a n
[normal]ational target 
[normal]in any event 
[normal]which is 
[normal]precisely 
[normal]what a C
[normal]apacity Review would have delivered.
[normal]  Clearly Dr
[normal] Hakin did not agree with a Capacity Review.
[normal]The GMC from the flawed analysis on the second assertion above clearly did not consider a Capacity Review necessary.  
[normal]Despite the
[normal] national code dealing with Capacity Reviews
[normal],
[normal] it is astounding that the GMC do not
[normal] question why Dr Hakin placed pressure on demonstrably struggling hospitals.
[normal]Comments on Dr [bold]Hakin[bold]Notwithstanding the GMC report it is evident from Dr Hakin’s own evidence that she 
[normal]did 
[normal]not support a Capacity Review which would have suspended targets and ea
[normal]sed concerns about safe care.
[normal]Comment on the GMC[bold]As commented above the GMC had ample evidence before it to show that targets should have been
[normal] suspended through a Capacity R
[normal]eview until new awards were built.  Furthermore it had before it the Code on Board 
[normal]Accountability which clearly state that it is a role of the SHA to ensure that the local plans meet the needs of the population.  
[normal]4[bold]. [bold] [bold]The fourth assertion is that no patients came to harm[bold].[bold]The report states
[normal]:
[normal]“
[normal]In fact, there is very little evidence to 
[normal]indicate that there was any risk to patient safety caused by anything said by Dr Hakin to Mr Walker. There is no statistical or expert evidence to demonstrate that anything said or done by Dr Hakin contributed to any diminution in patient safety or care.
[normal]M
[normal]uch of the complaint appears to be founded on the dichotomy between safety and targets for which there is so little evidence
[normal]We found very little evidence that there was any risk or harm to patients
[normal]”
[normal]In its analysis the GMC only looked at safety reviews 
[normal]being carried out in July 2009.
[normal]The complaint 
[normal]to
[normal] the GMC was not about patients coming to harm in Ju
[normal]ly
[normal] 2009, 
[normal]which 
[normal]appears to have been
[normal] the focus of Dr 
[normal]Hakin
[normal]’
[normal]s
[normal] response
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]The complaint was that the continued pursuit of targets would result in patients [bold]coming to harm and [bold]patients [bold]did[bold] come to harm[bold].[bold]It was not claimed that the hospitals were unsafe in July 2009; indeed the reverse as the Board of ULHT, unlike Mid Staffordshire, had passed a resolution in June 2009 making it cle
[normal]ar that it would not pursue n
[normal]on-
[normal]urgent targets at the risk of safety.  The issue 
[normal]of concern is
[normal] what happened after Mr Walker 
[normal]and his Chairman were 
[normal]effectively removed some months later. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] It is clear that 
[normal]after 
[normal]Mr Walker’s
[normal] removal 
[normal]targets did 
[normal]start 
[normal]to be pursued 
[normal]in a manner 
[normal]which comp
[normal]romised safety. E
[normal]vidence 
[normal]was submitted to the GMC 
[normal]from the 
[normal]Clinical Director of P
[normal]lann
[normal]ed
[normal] 
[normal]Care 
[normal]complaining
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]in 
[normal]early 
[normal]2010
[normal],
[normal] that following Mr Walker's removal
[normal] as C
[normal]hief 
[normal]E
[normal]xecutive there had been a shift in emphasis to the pursuit of targets at the expense of safety.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] There is evidence that some patients did come to harm 
[normal]with letters from clinicians specially referring to targets in those cases.  This correspondence was made
[normal] available to the GMC
[normal] which specifically identified cases and patient harm
[normal].
[normal]I
[normal]ndeed considerable evidence
[normal] exists 
[normal]of significant failures 
[normal]at
[normal] ULHT from 201
[normal]0/11
[normal] onwards leading to 
[normal]ULHT
[normal] being one of 14 hospitals 
[normal]subject to Keogh R
[normal]eview and 
[normal]is 
[normal]now in special mea
[normal]sures
[normal].
[normal]Comments on the GMC[bold]The GMC narrowed the scope of its investigation to the period round July 2009, to the benefit of Dr Hakin. 
[normal]The GMC had ample evidence before it to challenge 
[normal]safety post July 2009.
[normal] 
[normal] There were allegedly no warning signals to the r
[normal]elevant SHA in the case of Mid Staffordshire.  The same cannot be said of ULHT.  The performance of ULHT in terms of the patient experience deteriorated sharply from 2010/11.
[normal]The GMC refused to take additional evidence when the Keogh report was issued.
[normal]  Wh
[normal]ether this was
[normal] just incompetence on behalf of the GMC or
[normal] ‘political’ 
[normal]is
[normal] not clear.  
[normal]Taken together 
[normal]with the 
[normal]three assertions above
[normal],
[normal] if 
[normal]our submission and the evidence of others
[normal] had been properly examined the GMC could well have 
[normal]revealed 
[normal]that in a case 
[normal]liked to Mid Staffordshire there was evidence
[normal] potentially implicating 
[normal]a 
[normal]senior 
[normal]doctor
[normal] 
[normal]in a top management post 
[normal]in either acts of commission or omission
[normal]. Due to such failures an opportunity to intervene properly and ensure that the PCT worked to deliver a h
[normal]ealthcare system to meet the needs of Lincolnshire was lost
[normal].
[normal]  Even worse the failure to intervene in an appropriate way led to patients coming to harm.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
