defaultWritten evidence from Private Eye (GMC0018)defaultEVIDENCE SUBMITTED BY defaultDR defaultPHIL HAMMOND defaultAND defaultANDREW BOUSFIELDdefaultThe purpose of this submission to the Health Select Committee is to demonstrate that the Committee can have little defaultconfidence in the GMC's regulation of its doctorsdefault or its commitment to systems of safe caredefault.defaultIn the wake of the Mid-Staffs Inquiry the Secretary of State has made his expectations clear.
default&#xa0;
default He expects there to be a new culture of openness and transparency wi
defaultth 
defaulta 
defaultcommitment to candour 
defaultby staff and organisations.
default&#xa0;
default He expects regulators such as the GMC to hold staff to account.
defaultThis submission will show that at its first key test
default,
default the GMC has failed to meet these expectations it and that its disciplinary arrangements
default are not fit for purpose
default.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultOn July 29, 2012, w
defaulte referred Dr 
defaultHakin
default,
default currently Deputy Chief Executive of the Commissioning Board and previous Chief Executive of East Mid
defaultlands Strategic Health Authority to the GMC for her conduct in relation to United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust
default (ULHT)
default.
default&#xa0;
default The GMC have a key disciplinary role in relation to doctors in management.
default&#xa0;
default The complaint was wide ranging.
defaultAt the heart of our comp
defaultlaint was 
defaultthe requirement
default of doctors 
defaultto put patient safety first
default and the potential conflict between targets and safety
default.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultThe GMC 
defaultwould seem to condone the mindless pursuit of targets
default and its analysis of our complaint and response from the GMC 
defaulton October 25
default, 2013 
defaultdoes not reflect the learning from Mid Staffordshire
default.
default  The GMC 
defaultaccepts in 
defaultthe
defaultir
default report that there is no dichotomy between targets and safety.  Whilst that may be applicable in well funded, well staffed health systems with ample capacity it clearly c
defaultannot be said of health systems such as those of Mid Staffordshire or Lincolnshire which were under severe pressure.  Indeed the first investigation into Mid Staffs highlighted the conflict between targets and safety and recommended that Boards:
defaultensure thadefaultt a focus on elective work and targets is not to the detriment of emergency admissionsdefaultThe GMC found that in those parts of 
defaultour
default allegations dealing with inappropriate pressure on staff there was generally insufficient evidence to have a realistic prospect of successful if the GMC moved to a disciplinary hearing.
defaultHowever our complaints were much wider than 
default‘bullying’
default and encompasse
defaultd allegations of the pursuit of targets in overfull hospitals and that as a result patients came to harm.
default&#xa0;
default The GMC’s analysis 
defaultof 
defaultDr 
defaultHakin
default’
defaults
default response
default to these 
defaultallegations 
defaultcan be 
defaultbroadly 
defaultsummarised
default by four assertions
default:
defaultThe 
defaultGMC had ample evidence to refute all of these assertions.
defaultBased upon 
defaultits
default 
defaultflawed analysis and 
defaultuntested 
defaultassertions the GMC concluded that 
defaultfor that part of our complaint, 
defaultallegations of the pursuit of targets in overfull hospitals result
defaulting in patients 
defaultcoming
default to harm
default, t
defaulthere was 
defaultalso 
defaultno realistic prospect of pursuing Dr Hakin.
defaultThe Committee will be aware that 
defaultULHT has been described by Prof Sir Brian 
defaultJarman
default as ‘similar to Mid-Staffordshire’
default an
defaultd
default so these matters are important
default.
default  They are also important as the case involves one of the most senior doctors in 
defaultNHS 
defaultmanagement who should set an example to others.  
defaultThe quality of the investigation carried out by the GMC can give little confidence that the GMC as an organisation is cap
defaultable of responding effectively to the expectations of the Secretary of State.
default&#xa0;
default Not only were there a number of serious procedural defects and flaws in the investigation carried out, its findings and conclusions were 
defaultnot 
defaultconsistent with the evidence before 
defaultit.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultWe attach a critique of the
default GMC
default investigation at 
defaultAnnex A
default defaultfocussing in on the four false assertions above.
defaultOne of the procedural defects by the GMC was that it failed to show us, the complainants, the evidence put forward by Dr 
defaultHakin
default and as such it wa
defaults not challenged.
default&#xa0;
default If the GMC report accurately reflects Dr 
defaultHakin
default’
defaults
default evidence then 
defaultwe strongly contest it. 
defaultThe failure of the GMC to comply with one of the most basic rules of an investigation and share with us conflicting evidence
default,
default as part of the inquiry p
defaultrocess
default,
default is
default merely one of the grounds for 
defaultconsidering 
defaultseeking a Judicial Review of their decision.
default  Indeed
default we have been informed that the GMC
default would normally share controversial and conflicting evidence and have given us no reason for not doing so in this case.  We would only note th
defaultat the complaint concerned one o
defaultf its most senior members.
defaultFinally we 
defaultare
default 
defaultalso 
defaultconsidering 
defaultmaking a further compla
defaultint to the GMC that
default,
default 
defaulton the assumption that 
defaulttheir analysis of Dr 
defaultHakin’s
default response 
defaultis correct
default,
default 
defaultshe 
defaultmay have 
defaultmisled them. Whilst this submission is designed to inform the Health Select Committee in its annual review of the GMC
default,
default we are conscious that the evid
defaultence before you should cause concern about the leadership at the top of the NHS
default and the unlikelihood of 
defaultthe 
defaultdesired change 
defaultto a safer, kinder culture 
defaultwhilst that leadership persists. 
defaultThe GMC process 
defaultis 
defaultin our view 
defaultunkind, 
defaultuntimely, unfair, 
defaultinefficient
default and fails to protect patients
default or 
defaultadequately 
defaultconsider the emotional health of those referred. 
defaultOver two years ago, 
defaultw
defaulte 
defaultr
defaulteported the medical director of Great Ormond Street Hospital to the GMC for failing to act on the concerns of Baby Peter whistleblower Dr 
defaultKim Holt. The GMC
default is
default still investigating, 
defaultapparently 
defaulthampered by the lack of an independent expert. 
defaultThe GMC also does not appear to be proactive, relying on others making referrals to it rather than acting on media reports. The article that gave rise to bo
defaultth these referrals is authored and attached, and yet despite the grave allegations the GMC has never contacted us proactively for information. Our published response to their assessment of Dr Hakin’s referral is also attached. 
defaultFinally, in investigating th
defaultis matter the GMC instructed outside solicitors, Field Fisher Waterhouse, no doubt at great expense.  However, this has another benefit for the GMC.  It means that all communication in pursuance of the investigation is covered by legal professional privile
defaultge, and therefore not susceptible to a freedom of information request, or perhaps even Parliamentary scrutiny.  Whilst it is reasonable to instruct lawyers if required to collate evidence, it should not be used to impede proper accountability

defaults evidence the comments which follow
default 
defaultabout Dr Hakin 
defaultare made 
defaultin good faith and 
defaulton the basis that they may be reasonably deduced from the GMC report
default of her evidence.
default1default.default  defaultThe first assertion is that ULHT was no different to any other hospital, there was nothing unusual in Lincolnshire in termsdefault of demand or capacity which would have warranted defaultDr Hakindefault not insisting on targets being met.default&#xa0;default defaultAnalysis of the report shows:
defaultThe implication
default of Dr Hakin
default’
defaults evidence is that
default ‘
defaultThe demands and pressures on the Trust to perform better were reasonable
default’
default.
defaultThe 
defaultGMC conclude ‘..
defaultthere is no evidence that the SHA could or should have allowed the Trust to derogate because of the demand and capacity problems
default’
defaultIt is difficult to conclude other than such 
defaultanalysis is incompetent.
default&#xa0;
default Dr 
defaultHakin
default is aware of the following
default:
default 
defaultThis is a very significant point as Dr defaultHakindefault’defaultsdefault assertion that there was nothing unusual in Lincolnshire is then used to justify her other actions.defaultThe GMC had before it reports that ULHT was unusual due to 
defaultits
default geography, witness statements confirming that new 
defaultwards
default were to be built, data from Prof Sir Brian 
defaultJarman
default showing that 
defaultLincolnshire’s
default hospitals had significantly less available capacity to meet
default additional demand and reports fr
defaultom
default staff of the 
defaultEMSHA
default expressing safety concerns arising from the 
defaulthospitals
default being overfull.
defaultComments on Dr defaultHakindefaultIf Dr Hakin 
defaultassert
defaulted
default that there was nothing different in terms of demand and capacity 
defaultin Lincolnshire it would 
defaultin our view 
defaultbe de
defaultceitful and fall far short of the candour the Secretary of State is entitled to expect from a senior official.
default  There are few hospitals in the country where the position was so dire that additional wards had to be 
defaultbuilt as a result of the PCT failing to reduce demand in accordance with its plans.
defaultComments on the GMCdefaultThe GMC had significant evidence before it to show that there were 
defaultsevere 
defaultdemand
default and capacity issues at ULHT
default and were of such magnitude that additional 
defaultwards were to be built and were therefore were significantly worse than elsewhere
default.
defaultThe failure to recognise this is gross incompetence on behalf of the GMC but worse still it makes their remaining analysis fundamentally flawed
default as all of the rest of their a
defaultnalysis is based upon ULHT not having 
defaultexceptional 
defaultcapacity and demand problems
default.
default2default.default  defaultThe second assertion in her defence, Ddefaultr Hakindefault has claimed that all she was doing was following government policy and that as such she could not countenance any hospital failing to meet its targets.default&#xa0;default defaultIn March 2009 
defaultDr 
defaultHakin sent an e mail to all East Midlands chief executives stating 
default‘I need to make i
defaultt very clear that I expect you personally to ensure that your organisations deliver 100% for the next three weeks.... We cannot afford even one day when one single organisation falters.’
default 
defaultThe GMC report states
default“
defaultHer [Dr Hakin] argument is that safety and ta
defaultrgets are inextricably linked and the complaint is based on a false dichotomy between the two
default.
defaultShe says she was accountable to the Chief Executive of the NHS, who in turn was accountable to the Secretary of State for compliance with targets, and that allow
defaulting Mr Walker's failure to meet the targets to go unchallenged would have been a breach of her statutory obligations, a dereliction of her duties as a doctor and denied patients' rights.
default'as a matter of basic common sense, it is inconceivable that an SHA C
defaulthairman could reasonably agree with a request from a Trust Chairman to objectives which envisage local abrogation of national targets', which she says would have disadvantaged patients in the area
default.
default”
defaultThis 
defaultmisrepresents the arrangements that were in place.  
defaultIt was never intended that all hospitals defaultbe required to defaultmeet defaultall defaulttargets defaultat all times defaultregardless of the circumstances.default  
defaultI
defaultt was policy under a published Code of C
defaultonduct that if a hospital ha
defaultd
default met more than
default its contracted demand and cannot continue to meet t
defaultargets, then
default under a so called Capacity Review’ 
defaultthe requirement to meet targets is temporarily suspended until for example new capacity can be built or other arrangements made.
default&#xa0;
default This 
defaultinterpretation
default of the Code
default has been confirmed 
defaultin writing 
defaultby the D
defaulto
defaultH.
default&#xa0;
default D
defaultr 
defaultHakin appears to have 
defaultwilfully ignored this 
defaultCode 
defaultand led others to believe that her demand to meet targets was consistent with government policy 
defaultand the arrangements in force 
defaultwhen it was not. 
defaultWors
defaulte
default still given the learning from Mid Staffordshire
default,
default it is ex
defaulttraordinary that such a senior public official could take such a stance with hospitals so overcrowded and under pressure that there
default was a
default plan to build new wards.

default Hakin by both ignoring the Code of Conduct on Capacity Reviews
default 
defaultand the fa
defaultct that the position at ULHT was such that

default (
defaultwhich would have resulted in the temporary suspension to meet targets
default)
default would be warranted
default, appears to have
default misled the GMC investigation
default.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultComment on the GMCdefaultThe analysis by the GMC 
defaultin accepting Dr Hakin’s evidence 
defaultwas incompetent.  It had 
defaultreceived 
defaultfrom witnesses explanations of what should happen in these circumstances and documents from the DoH confirming that targets should be temporarily suspended
default when Capacity Reviews are warrant
defaulted
default.  It also had data showing that the contractual situation at ULHT wo
defaultuld have more than justified a Capacity R
defaulteview
default and the suspension of targets
default.
default3default.default  defaultThe third assertion defaultis defaultthat defaulta Cdefaultadefaultpacity Rdefaulteview defaultwhich would have defaulttdefaulto adefaultllow a derogation of targets wasdefault not defaultblockeddefault by defaultDr Hakindefault, and wasdefault not in any case warranteddefault.defaultThe report states:
default“
defaultMr Bowles 
default[the Chair of ULHT] 
defaultrefers to raising a capacity review with both the PCT and the SHA and that there was an "absolute flat out refusal', though he provides no evidence of the request to or the refusal by the SHA. Nonetheless, his evidence provides some limited support to the 
defaultalleged fact of the refusal but no support as to the involvement of Dr Hakin.
default”
default 
defaultIt then however says the evidence of Dr Hakin
default about this matter was:
default“
defaultas a matter of basic common sense, it is inconceivable that an SHA Chairman could reasonably agree with a 
defaultrequest from a Trust Chairman to objectives which envisage local abrogation of national targets', which she says would have disadvantaged patients in the area
default 
default…..
default”
defaultThe GMC report is internally inconsistent.  On the one ha
defaultn
defaultd
default,
default it sa
defaulty
defaults there is little evidenc
defaulte of Dr Hakin’s refusal to support a Capacity Review but then contains evidence
default from Dr Hakin 
default that she would not support a abrogation of a n
defaultational target 
defaultin any event 
defaultwhich is 
defaultprecisely 
defaultwhat a C
defaultapacity Review would have delivered.
default  Clearly Dr
default Hakin did not agree with a Capacity Review.
defaultThe GMC from the flawed analysis on the second assertion above clearly did not consider a Capacity Review necessary.  
defaultDespite the
default national code dealing with Capacity Reviews
default,
default it is astounding that the GMC do not
default question why Dr Hakin placed pressure on demonstrably struggling hospitals.
defaultComments on Dr defaultHakindefaultNotwithstanding the GMC report it is evident from Dr Hakin’s own evidence that she 
defaultdid 
defaultnot support a Capacity Review which would have suspended targets and ea
defaultsed concerns about safe care.
defaultComment on the GMCdefaultAs commented above the GMC had ample evidence before it to show that targets should have been
default suspended through a Capacity R
defaulteview until new awards were built.  Furthermore it had before it the Code on Board 
defaultAccountability which clearly state that it is a role of the SHA to ensure that the local plans meet the needs of the population.  
default4default. default defaultThe fourth assertion is that no patients came to harmdefault.defaultThe report states
default:
default“
defaultIn fact, there is very little evidence to 
defaultindicate that there was any risk to patient safety caused by anything said by Dr Hakin to Mr Walker. There is no statistical or expert evidence to demonstrate that anything said or done by Dr Hakin contributed to any diminution in patient safety or care.
defaultM
defaultuch of the complaint appears to be founded on the dichotomy between safety and targets for which there is so little evidence
defaultWe found very little evidence that there was any risk or harm to patients
default”
defaultIn its analysis the GMC only looked at safety reviews 
defaultbeing carried out in July 2009.
defaultThe complaint 
defaultto
default the GMC was not about patients coming to harm in Ju
defaultly
default 2009, 
defaultwhich 
defaultappears to have been
default the focus of Dr 
defaultHakin
default’
defaults
default response
default. 
default 
defaultThe complaint was that the continued pursuit of targets would result in patients defaultcoming to harm and defaultpatients defaultdiddefault come to harmdefault.defaultIt was not claimed that the hospitals were unsafe in July 2009; indeed the reverse as the Board of ULHT, unlike Mid Staffordshire, had passed a resolution in June 2009 making it cle
defaultar that it would not pursue n
defaulton-
defaulturgent targets at the risk of safety.  The issue 
defaultof concern is
default what happened after Mr Walker 
defaultand his Chairman were 
defaulteffectively removed some months later. 
default&#xa0;
default It is clear that 
defaultafter 
defaultMr Walker’s
default removal 
defaulttargets did 
defaultstart 
defaultto be pursued 
defaultin a manner 
defaultwhich comp
defaultromised safety. E

default&#xa0;
default There is evidence that some patients did come to harm 
defaultwith letters from clinicians specially referring to targets in those cases.  This correspondence was made
default available to the GMC
default which specifically identified cases and patient harm

defaultComments on the GMCdefaultThe GMC narrowed the scope of its investigation to the period round July 2009, to the benefit of Dr Hakin. 
defaultThe GMC had ample evidence before it to challenge 
defaultsafety post July 2009.
default 
default There were allegedly no warning signals to the r
defaultelevant SHA in the case of Mid Staffordshire.  The same cannot be said of ULHT.  The performance of ULHT in terms of the patient experience deteriorated sharply from 2010/11.
defaultThe GMC refused to take additional evidence when the Keogh report was issued.
