[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Executive Summary[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Background and context[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The [bold]Coa[bold]lition Government’s academies and free s[bold]chools programmes[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]i) Equality of opportunity – 
[normal]Reform programmes must seek to promote the development of an education system 
[normal]that 
[normal]ensures
[normal] equality of opportunity in terms of admissions, provision and 
[normal]educational outcomes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]ii) Democratic accountability – R
[normal]eform of the
[normal] education system
[normal] must be consistent with democratic values and must ensure that all publicly funded institutions are democratically accountable to the communities 
[normal]they serve
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]iii) Value for money/transparency – 
[normal]Reform strategies must seek to 
[normal]secure effective
[normal] transparency in 
[normal]relation to the way in which financial resources are allocated across the system
[normal] and should ensure that all spending commitments 
[normal]are
[normal] 
[normal]evaluated robustly and objectively against clear economic efficiency and value for money c
[normal]riteria.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]iv) Raises standards – 
[normal]R
[normal]eforms of the school system must be designed to ensure that 
[normal]all pupils are able to access high quality, engaging and relevant leaning opportunities
[normal] that secure the highest possible levels of pupil progress and achievement
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]v) Union recognition – 
[normal]Approaches to reform must 
[normal]ensure that workforce unions a
[normal]re properly represented to enable 
[normal]the perspectives of teachers, school leaders and other members of the wider school workforce 
[normal]to be 
[normal]taken into effective account
[normal] 
[normal]in strategic planning and decision-making processes 
[normal]and 
[normal]to ensure that 
[normal]condition
[normal]s are created that support and promote 
[normal]high quality teaching and learning
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]vi) National 
[normal]pay and conditions of service –
[normal] 
[normal]Reform programmes 
[normal]must support 
[normal]the operation of 
[normal]nationa
[normal]l pay and conditions
[normal] frameworks that ensure that all pupils, regardless of the school they attend, 
[normal]receive their 
[normal]common 
[normal]entitlement to 
[normal]highly skilled, 
[normal]motivated and well trained teacher
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]with 
[normal]terms and conditions 
[normal]that enable them to work effectively to rai
[normal]se standards.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]vii) Viability – 
[normal]Approaches to reform must
[normal] ensure that all 
[normal]schools and other relevant settings
[normal] are viable and sustainable financially and are not 
[normal]funded on the basis of
[normal] sectional or individual short term interests.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]viii) 
[normal]A s
[normal]upportive and co
[normal]llaborative approach to community education – 
[normal]Reform programmes must secure
[normal] 
[normal]the adoption and enhancement of 
[normal]collaborati
[normal]ve approaches within and between 
[normal]institutions
[normal], noting, however, that collaboration does not preclude parents from exercising 
[normal]their legiti
[normal]mate 
[normal]rights to make 
[normal]informed 
[normal]choices about the 
[normal]schools or other relevant settings their children might attend.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]ix) Rooted within the community – 
[normal]Any reform of the education system 
[normal]must ensure that schools are rooted within, not set apart from,
[normal] their commu
[normal]nities
[normal] and represent the best of the values and aspirations of 
[normal]those
[normal] communities
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]x) Evidence based – 
[normal]Approaches to reform
[normal] must be based on a genuine, considered use of evidence of educational practice, building on consultation betwe
[normal]en all stakeholders, 
[normal]i
[normal]ncluding workforce
[normal] unions.
