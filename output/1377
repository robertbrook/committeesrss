[normal]Our submission focuses upon public perceptions of, and engagement with, CCS. This issue has risen in importance since proposed CCS projects at 
[normal]Barendrecht
[normal] (Netherlands), 
[normal]Beeskow
[normal] (Germany) and Greenville (USA) stumbled in large part due to public opposition. The proposed 
[normal]Hunterston
[normal] power plant + partial CCS development in Scotland encountered strong local and NGO opposition and partial CCS at the proposed new 
[normal]Kingsnorth
[normal] coal power plant did not ameliorate NGO 
[normal]furore
[normal]. Some claim that offshore CO
[normal]2
[normal] storage will be of no (or minimal) concern to the public but this ignores Brent Spa, the legacy of the Gulf of Mexico drilling disaster, controversies over offshore 
[normal]renewables
[normal] development, the necessary onshore infrastructure 
[normal]and the importance of values which do not correspond with land/sea boundaries
[normal]. CCS has become a prism for the playing out of different values about our energy future – to what extent should it depend upon large centralized power plants rather than much more distributed generation?  To what extent should it continue to depend upon coal?  Will CCS lock us more deeply into the fossil fuel economy, beyond which we urgently need to progress according to many; or might CCS provide us with the breathing-space to develop 
[normal]renewables
[normal] – a sort of bridge to a genuinely sustainable low-carbon energy future?  How long should that bridge be and could it be forever extended as policy makers and industry invest more into expensive fossil fuel and CCS infrastructure?  What is the risk of CO
[normal]2
[normal] stores in rock formations leaking? Such questions rapidly emerge when members of the public participate in discussion and focus groups on CCS. Most of these questions cannot be answered by scientists and herein lies a problem since there are precious few avenues for the public to have a debate about what role CCS might have in the near and medium-term future and its relative importance vis-à-vis other low-carbon options such as 
[normal]renewables
[normal], energy efficiency, demand reduction and nuclear. We review what is known about public perceptions of CCS and provide recommendations to Government and developers on how to better engage with publics for more resilient decision-making
[normal] in terms of both process and outcome
[normal].

[normal]We are social scientists who have been working on CCS policy, public perception and technology assessment issues since 2000 (
[normal]Shackley
[normal]), 2009 (
[normal]Evar
[normal]) and 2011 (
[normal]Mabon
[normal]). In addition to past work for Tyndall, 
[normal]DECC and IEA, 
[normal]we have been involved in recent projects such as EU 
[normal]SiteChar
[normal] (a 5-day citizens’ panel on perceptions of CCS in Moray, NE Scotland) (2010-12), EU ECO
[normal]2 
[normal](public and stakeholder perceptions of offshore CO
[normal]2
[normal] storage in Scotland and Yorkshire &amp; Humberside) (2011-2015) and the Global CCS Institute-funded Large Group Process on public perceptions of low-carbon energy technologies (involving 100 members of the Edinburgh 
[normal]public
[normal]) (2011) (

[normal]).  We are happy to supply the Committee with papers, reports and other documentary material upon request.
