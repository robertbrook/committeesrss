Written evidence from the National Federation of Retail Newsagents [TOB07]
defaultIntroductiondefault1. 
defaultThe National Federation of Retail Newsagents (NFRN) would like to thank the Committee for the invitation to make a written submission on the issue of tobacco smuggling.
default2. The NFRN is one of Europe’s largest trade associations, representing over 
default16,000
default 
defaultfee paying members from approximately 
default18
default,000 
defaultindependent newsagents and convenience stores across the UK, Channel Islands and the Republic of Ireland.
default 
defaultWe are a membership led organisation
default 
defaultthat 
defaultis
default democratically structured
default;
default 
defaultpolicy is made by annual conference and its implementation is overseen by National Council.
default3. 
defaultThe NFRN assist
defaults
default the independent retailer to  compete more effectively in today’s highly competitive market through the provision of practical help and assistance, commercial support, deals and buying opportunities, training, expertise and services, it also represents its members’ interests at gover
defaultnmental and parliamentary level
default, as well as within the news and magazine industry
default.
default 
defaultGeneral rdefaultemarksdefault4
default. The NFRN 
defaultrecognise
defaults that there have been a number of high profile and high value raids and seizures of illicit cigarettes in recent months. Notably in July 2013, officers from HMRC arrested five people during raids across the Peterborough and Spalding areas as part of an investigation into a suspected case of £6 million worth of cigarette smuggling fraud
default.

default. 
defaultT
defaulthe NFRN 
defaultalso 
defaultacknowledges
default the recent publication of 
defaultthe National Audit Office’s report into the progress of HMRC’s implementation of its tobacco smuggling strategy
default. However
default it was evident from the report
default that given HMRC’s estimate that tobacco smuggling cost the Exchequer £1.9bn in lost revenue over the 2010-11 period, and that it did not meet any of its “more stretching” targets in 2012-13, further action is required
default to tackle the problem accordingly
default.

default. 
defaultThe consequences of t
defaultobacco smuggling 
defaulthave
default a
default direct and far-reaching
default 
defaultimpact
default on the businesses of our members. The availability of cheaper, but illicit 
defaulttobacco
default 
defaultcan 
defaultresult
default in cash-strapped consumers purchasing tobacco from alternative sources
default, at the expense of responsible and legitimate retailers
default.  Such behaviour not only impacts on the finances of businesses and the Treasury, but most importantly, on the health of consumers
default who consume 
defaultthe 
defaultillicit 
defaultproducts
default.
default7. It is also worth 
defaultnoting that smuggling also impacts on the under-age consumption of tobacco products. 
defaultUnlike responsible retailers, 
defaultsellers of illicit tobacco will not ask for I.D from custome
defaultrs who appear under-age. Therefore 
defaulttobacco smuggling provides an
default accessible
default avenue for those who wish to obtain tobacco 
defaultproducts 
defaultwhilst under-age. 
default8
default.
default Counterfeit cigarettes often pose additional health risks to those traditionally associated with smoking, due to the variety of ingredients used. A BBC investigation
default in 2012
default discovered that illicit cigarettes sold for purchase in Sussex, contained levels of cancer-causing chemicals that were far higher than those 
defaultfound 
defaultin the legal, regulated products
default.
default The NFRN would recommend that 
defaultgreater
default promotion 
defaultof
default the
default dangers of
default dubious ingredients and potential health impacts of counterfeit cigarettes should be undertaken
default, in order
default to educate 
defaultand
default discourage people from purchasing such products. 
default9
default. Whilst the NFRN supports the government in its aim to reduce the number of people who smoke and
default to 
defaultprevent young people from starting
default the habit
default, it must be acknowledged that recent legislation such as the tobacco display 
defaultban
default c
defaultould potentially result in unintended 
defaultand undesirable 
defaultconsequences.
default 
defaultWhen the ban comes in to force in small stores in 2015, 
defaultit raises the possibility that 
defaultconsumers
default may 
defaultturn away from legitimate retailers to illicit sources
default, 
defaultas a consequence of l
defaultegal transactions being made more difficult
default.
default 
defaultAlternatively,
default for those customers unaware of the tobacco display ban, a belief that their local store no longer stocks tobacco
default may encourage them to seek out more convenient but illegal sources
default.
default10
default. 
defaultThe NFRN
default also
default 
defaultconsiders the link between tobacco smuggling and organised crime 
defaultto be
default a major concern. An attempt to s
defaultmuggle 30 million cigarettes in
defaultto the UK through the Port
default of Southampton
default in March 2013, highlights both the scale and professionalism
default of
default some smuggling operations
default that take place
default.
default As a consequence of the findings of the NAO report, it would desirable for HMRC to be equipped with all of the necessary resources in order to tackle this problem efficiently.
default11
default. 
defaultThe NFRN are campaigning actively on a number of issues relating to smuggling, including the Tobacco Products Directive (TPD). 
defaultThe upcoming vote on the 
defaultTPD
default is a potential further complication in the fight against tobacco smuggling
default as t
defaulthe NFRN fears that if the directive is agreed, the 
defaultprohibition
default of ten packs,
default menthol cigarettes,
default slims, and the introduction of combined warnings (picture plus text) of 75% on both sides of the tobacco packet
default will 
defaultonly serve to 
defaultencourage
default smuggling
default and counterfeiting
default, as packets may be easier to copy and some products such as menthols will only be available via illicit sources
default. 
defaultAs the directive will leave the door open for the government to
default bring in plain packaging for tobacco products in 
defaultthe UK, the NFRN 
defaultis 
defaultconcern
defaulted
default that the packaging will be simpler and easier
default to counterfeit, resulting in a
default further 
defaultinflux of illicit tobacco. Similarly, 
defaultthose who wish to purchase 
defaultthe outlawed 
defaultitems
default may feel tempted to buy them illicitly.

defaultDeclaration of interestsdefault13
default.
default In 2012 the NFRN reorganised with the separation of the not-for-profit trade association from its commercial operations, NFRN Commercial Ltd.
defaultThe NFRNdefault14
default. The NFRN, while working with tobacco manufactures on issues of mutual concern, has no financial links or arrangements with any tobacco manufacturer.
default15
default. The NFRN does work with the Tobacco Retailer Association, Tobacco Manufacturers Association and campaign groups such as “Hands Off Our Packs” and “No Thank EU” on matters of common interest.  In August 2013 the NFRN assisted in arranging the distribution of campaign and information packs from the “No Thank EU” campaign to NFRN members across the country.
default16
default. The NFRN does not receive any funding from, nor does it fund, any of these groups.
default17
default.  NFRN policy is set by members at its Annual Conference.   Members of staff, including those who deal with tobacco manufacturers and campaign groups, are not permitted to take part in the policy debates at the Annual Conference.
default18
default. In the Republic of Ireland, Transatlantic Public Affairs, who also work for Philip Morris, have provided no cost public affairs advice to the local NFRN district.  Such advice is monitored by the Head Office Public Affairs team to ensure compliance with the aims and objectives of the NFRN.
default19
default. The Public Affairs team works for the NFRN and does not  have sight of commercial agreements between the NFRN, NFRN Commercial Ltd and third parties, whether they be tobacco manufacturers or not.
defaultNFRN Commercialdefault 
defaultLtddefault20
default. NFRN Commercial Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary
default operated at arm’s length from 
defaultthe NFRN, maintains commercial relationships with most tobacco manufacturers.   As a result of these relationships an amount of £
default28,000
default pa is spent by tobacco manufacturers on advertising and sponsorship.   
default21
default. As these relationships are with NFRN Commercial Ltd, the companies have no influence over NFRN policy.
default22
default. Senior management ha
defaultve received a modest amount of 
defaulthospitality from tobacco manufacturers.
default All such hospitality is recorded and is available for inspection.
default As members of staff, they do not have any say in the adoption or revision of NFRN policy.
defaultNewtrade Publishing Ltddefault23
default. The NFRN also owns Newtrade Publishing Ltd, publishers inter alia of Retail Newsagent and Retail Express.   Newtrade Publishing Ltd is operated as an arm’s length organisation, with contact limited to senior NFRN management and the Communications and Public Affairs teams who deal with Newtrade Publishing Ltd staff as normal press contacts.   Newtrade Publishing Ltd publications have carried advertising from tobacco manufacturers but this is unrelated to the work of the NFRN.
defaultGeneral Principledefaultsdefault24
default. While the NFRN
default,
default NFRN Commercial
default Ltd and Newtrade Publishing Ltd
default believe that it is perfectly legitimate to have business relationships with the manufacturers of legal tobacco products, they are aware of the sensitivity of the sector and the potential for reputational risk.   The NFRN and NFRN Commercial Ltd therefore take a conservative approach to these relationships, ensuring that relationships are 
defaultfocused
default towards achieving the aims and objectives of the NFRN and that all commercial arrangements are proportionate to the service being provided
default. 
defaultWhether the current sanctions and penalties for tobacco smuggling are appropriatedefault25
default. 
defaultCurrently, 
defaultt
defaulthe NFRN considers that the sanctions and penalties for tobacco smuggling are not 
defaulta sufficient
default deterrent. 
defaultG
defaultiven that 1.7 billion cigarettes were reportedly seized in the period 2010-11
default, it would appear that the financial incentives of cigarette smuggling are continuing to outweigh the risks of r
defaulteceiving a sanction and/or 
defaultpenalty
default. 
default2
default6
default.
default This view i
defaults 
defaultendorsed
default by 
defaultAndrew Leggett
default, Deputy Director for Indirect Tax at HMRC
default, who gave evidence on the EU cigarette strategy
default to the House of Lords 
defaultSelect Committee on the European Union
default - Home Affairs, Health and Education (Sub-Committee F), which was held on Wednesday 24
defaultth
default July 2013. 
default2
default7
default. Leggett admitted that 
defaultlarge amounts of money could be made from illicit 
defaultcigarette sales, highlighting that a pack of “20 cigarettes is twice the price of an illicit pack of 20 cigarettes” 
defaultand considered that “at the moment the 
defaultbalance of risk and reward is a good one for tobacco default[smuggling] defaultgloballydefault”
default. 
default2
default8
default.
default It is important to note that w
defaulthils
defaultt the NFRN would 
defaultlike stronger deterrence’s
default for cigarette smugglers, 
defaultit would not 
defaultsupport
default measures which would place further burdens on those who are legitimate sellers
default of tobacco products
default.
default2
default9
default. The NFRN suggests that 
defaultattention
default also needs to be given to
default the different methods of
default deterring the consumer from purchasing illicit tobacco.
default For example, 
defaultin the Quebec region of Canada, 
defaultthey have opted to criminalise
default 
defaultconsumers of illicit tobacco
default through the 
defaultTobacco Tax Act
default, a policy the NFRN would encourage the committee to examine during its inquiry.
default30
default. Furthermore as mentioned previously in paragraph 6, the NFRN would encourage 
defaultraising
default 
defaultawareness of the ingredients and potential health implications that can 
defaultresult from
default the consumption of illicit tobacco products
default, as a potential means to reduce the level of tobacco smuggling
default.
defaultThe possible impact of the introduction of standardized packaging in Ireland on the quantity and availability of illegal tobacco in the UKdefault3
default1
default. 
defaultThe NFRN disagrees with the introduction of standardised packaging for cigarettes in Ireland. Whilst the intention to make tobacco less attractive to consumers is a laudable aim, 
defaultwe consider that the policy 
defaultc
defaultould have unintended
default negative effects on consumers.
default 
defaultIt is worth noting that s
defaultince the introduction of the display ban in Ireland, 
defaultsmoking has not decreased but the proliferation of illicit tobacco has increased.
default3
default2
default. 
defaultOne
default unintended consequence of the policy if 
defaultintroduced
default could be that 
defaultthe number of counterfeit cigarettes could increase. As tobacco products would be subject to specific
default and generic
default packaging design requirements as set out by 
defaultstatute
default, there is a risk that essentially, a “how to” manual for counterfeiters is being produced
default. This combined with the fact that packs will be simpler in design, suggests that counterfeiting process will become easier, potentially leading to an increase in illicit tobacco.
default3
default3
default.
default HMRC have also conceded that “the simpler you make a package, the easier it is to counterfeit it”, however
default 
defaultthey 
defaultdid state
default the
defaultir belief that there
default was not the evidence available to 
default“to quantify the extent to which those risks would materialise
default”.
default3
default4
default. In addition, if the policy is implemented and it does lead to an increase in illicit tobacco as the NFRN 
defaultbelieves
default, this will have a knock on 
defaulteffect for legitimate retailers who provide a valuable service to communities,
default 
defaultpotentially putting some of our members out of business
default and 
defaultdetrimentally 
defaultimpacting upon the health of consumers
default.
default3
default5
default. 
defaultThe lack of evidence currently available is a further reason why the NFRN considers the decision on plain packaging in Ireland should be delayed. 
defaultI
defaultt would be sensible to wait until furth
defaulter data
default from Australia
default is published
default,
default so that there can be
default sufficient
default analysis and a fuller understanding of the potential 
defaultconsequences
default of the policy. 
defaultConclusiondefault3
default6
default.
default 
defaultWhilst the NFRN acknowledges the steps HMRC have taken to reduce tobacco smuggling, the volume of the illicit market is still far too
default high. This is
default to the detriment 
defaultof both 
defaultthe consumer’s health and the finances of hard-working, independent businesses in the retail and convenience sector. 
defaultWith the upcoming vote on the TPD rapidly approaching and the potential effects of the directive if passed on tobacco smuggling, the NFRN welcomes the committee’s decision to launch an inquiry into this issue.
