"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written evidence from \nTransport for London\n (WRT 017)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;1. \nIntroduction&#xa0;1.1\n              \nTransport for London (TfL) welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the \n              \nCommittee’s inquiry into \nwinter resili\nence in transport\n. \n&#xa0;\n1.\n2\n              \nO\nur organisation and London Councils, the body representing all the London boroughs and the City of London, ha\nve well-developed plans, prepar\ned alongside the emergency services and Network Rail, to keep the transport \nnetwork\n open th\nroughout severe weather. \n As well as the C\napital’s road network, t\nhis includes\n \nroads and footways linking to\n bus garages and \nbus \nstations, railway \nand U\nnderground \nstations, hospitals\n, \nand police, fire and ambulance stations across the city.\n \nDuring \npe\nriods of severe weather, TfL\n and borough staff will work aroun\nd the clock across\n London Underground\n (LU)\n, \nand our b\nus, \nr\nail and road networks to min\nimise disruption during adverse\n winter weather\n conditions.  \n&#xa0;\n1.3\n              \nSalt is stockpiled by us\n and the borough\ns\n to ensure that all road users\n can \n           \ncontinue to move around the Capital.\n \nA fleet of \nroad \ngritters\n will be deplo\nyed \n   \n           to keep the roads clear and \narrangements are in place to enable the \n              \nboroughs to share salt stores, if \nnecessary. \nA pan-London Strategic Salt \n           \nReserve is also available should \n              \nreplenishment arrangements via the normal \n           \nsupply chain be disrupted.  Where exceptional rainfall is forecast, heavy duty \n           \npumps are placed on standby to react \nto localised flooding, so as to keep our \n           \nmain road network operable.\n&#xa0;\n1.4      \nDe-icing trains will be in operation, keeping tracks as clear as possible; \n   \n           \np\nlatforms will be gritted and lineside equipment, including point motors, \nwill be \n  \nchecked. \nStaff and contractors are used to keep the platforms \nand \nTube \nstation\n areas clear and de-iced. \nNetwork Rail, whose tracks are \nused by certain U\nnderground\n \nservices and which\n manage\ns\n \nmost\n of \nthe infrastructure used by London\n \nOverground\n, \nalso work\ns\n closely with us to prepare the network\n for winter\n conditions\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.5\n              \nLondoners and visitors to the city \nshould check our\n website\n, particularly \nduring periods of severe\n weather t\no help \nthem \nplan ahead and to get\n travel information on the move.\n&#xa0;\n1.6\n  \n              \nWe \nha\nve\n developed \nour \ncontingency plans\n,\n includin\ng lessons learned from previous \nwinter\ns,\n to ensure that London’s\n \nroad and rail operations are able to maintain a good leve\nl of service for their users\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.7\n              \nEach part of TfL \n(\nRoads, Buses, LU\n and London Rail) \nhas an operational plan for winter includi\nng snowfall and sub-zero temperatures\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.  Roads and Buses&#xa0;\nWeather forecasting\n&#xa0;\n2.1\n      \nWe have \nweather forecasting contracts in place \nfor our\n network\ns, and which are specific to the affected m\nodes. \n \n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nDuty officers in \nour \nSurface\n \nTransport \nAsset Management\n Directorate \ntake \n              \naction on \nthe basis of\n \ndata \nprovided by a weather\n forecasting service from \n           \nMeteoG\nroup and from \nour \nown weather station information. During severe \n           \nwinter weather, a ‘snow desk’\n \nis established in \nour \nLondon Streets Traffic \n           Control Centre \n(LSTCC) to \ncoordinate\n sal\nting and snow ploughing operations\n \n           \nand \nto \nliaise with \nthe\n \nboroughs and CentreComm\n, our control centre for \n           \nLondon Buses\n. \n&#xa0;\nOperational processes\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n              \nRoads \n–\n \nwe are responsible for the treatment of all of London’s Red Routes, a \n              \nnetwork of 580km.  Throughout winter, a fleet of 40 gritters, all of which can \n              \nbe fitted with ploughs, as well as \ngritting quad bikes, flat bed trucks and teams\n \n              \nof operatives are on standby for deployment\n across the network. \nWe have \n           agreed with the \nboroughs a list of core bus routes, bus garage locations and \n           bus stands to \nensure bus services c\nan be maintained.\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n              \nM\nost highway authorities have gritting networks which are prioritised by use, \nwith both the \nTransport for London Road Network (TLRN)\n and\n the Strategic Road N\network\n (SRN)\n, are treated\n as high priority. The frequency and type of treatm\nent is \ndependent\n on prevailing and forecast weather conditions to ensure the entire network remains operable. Reports of the planned treatments are sent to stakeholders.\n&#xa0;\n2.5\n              \nPriority routes for gritting are al\nso published on our\n website\n and include \n              \nmain \nroads, bus routes and roads leading to fire stations and hospitals, etc.  \n              \nPavements \nin busy areas will also be treat\ned to help pedestrians and support \n              \nlocal businesses.  A pan-London Strategic Salt Reserve is also available for \n              \nus and the boroughs shoul\nd supplies become low during the winter.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.6\n              \nBus\nes – our objective \nduring periods of heavy snow \nis \nto help maintain \nmany routes running a\ns\n normal \na \nservice as possible, providing passengers with a safe journey to their destinations. Contingency planning is reliant on working closely with \nbus o\nperators, \nthe \nLSTCC and \nour \nAsset Management\n \nDirectorate when requesting or receiving priority gritting or sno\nw\n \nclearing requests on the T\nLRN\n. It also relies on close contact with the \nL\nondon \nL\nocal \nA\nuthorities \nC\noordination \nC\nentre\n (LLACC)\n and individual\n \nB\norough Winter Teams to ensure that as full gritting coverage as possible is \n           \nmaintained on borough roa\nds.\n&#xa0;2.7\n              \nCycl\ning\n \n–\n \nwe have\n produced guidance regarding winter clothing and reflective \n              \nsafety equipment and advise all cyclists to take extra care while cycling during \n              \nwinter months. \n&#xa0;\n2.8\n              \nThe Barclays Cycle Hire scheme and \nCycle Superhighways fall within the \n              \nwinter \ncontingency plans of the TfL Asset Management\n Directorate and the \n           Borough \nW\ninter Teams as \nexplained above\n.\n &#xa0;\n2.9\n              \nOur \nLondon River Services \ndivision \nmaintain\ns\n stocks of salt to ensure that \n              \npedestrian \naccess areas on \nthe \napproaches to \nits\n piers are maintained for \n              \nsafe use of passengers. Access roads to the Woolwich Ferry \nt\nerminal are \n              \nmaintained under the winter service plans of \nour \nRoads\n team\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.10\n              \nDial-a-Ride \nand Victoria Coach Station both maintai\nn stocks of salt which are \n              \nused to maintain use of their \nfacilities\n. \n&#xa0;\nTreatments\n and de-icing\n&#xa0;\n2.11\n              \nThe highways winter \nservice is operable\n between 1October and 30\n \nApril. \n           \nTreatment\n plans are maintained by \nour \nRoads Directorate. These are \n            \nreviewed\n and optimised \n annually with input from \nacross our organisation \nas \n            \nwell as \nfrom \ne\nxternal stakeholders including b\noroughs. \n&#xa0;\n2.\n12\n              \nThe winter season started on 1\n October\n and as of that date w\ne are\n ready \n           \nto treat the network with plant and materials \nstanding by. \nOur salt stock levels \n           \nhave been revised in accordance with national guidance and we now have a \n           \ncontracted minimum stock level, sufficient to treat the network 90 times, whic\nh \n           \nequates to a minimum stock of s\nome 10,000 tonnes. \nCurrent stock levels \n           \nstand at approximately 14,400 tonnes, giving an operational buffer of 4,400 \n           \ntonnes.  Stock replenishment will be undertaken during the season so as\n to \n         \n \n \nmaintain an operational buffer and only in c\nontinual severe conditions will\n         \n \n there \nbe a risk of stock levels falling below the minimum 10,000 tonne \n          \n \nrequirement. \nSalt usage through the winter will obviously depend on th\ne \n         \n \n conditions that \nultimately develop\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.13\n   \nAs risk mitigation against in season shortage of salt from suppliers, TfL has \n          \nestablished a pan-London Reserve Salt Stock of 27,000t, held at Dagenham, \n          \navailable to ourselves and the boroughs. This is to be used \nas a last resort\n          \nafter all supply chain or options for mutual aid between neighbouring \n          \nauthorities have been exhausted. With prudent use that should be sufficient to \n        \n  \ntreat London’s key ‘resilience’ routes for a period of about two weeks.\n&#xa0;\nCommand and control\n&#xa0;\n2.14\n              \nWe \nuse the ‘Gold’, ‘Silver’, ‘Bronze’ structure. This relates to the role that each person within the command structure will play as opposed to ‘rank’, the\n roles being Strategic, Tactical and Operational respectively. It mirrors the structure utilised by the emergency services and is used by senior managers across \nTfL\n on a regular basis for major planned events. The same command structure is also utilised by the Metropolitan Police’s Safer Transport Command and \nTraffic Operational Command Unit\n whose operations centre\n,\n Metrocomm\n,\n is co-located \nwith our \nSurface Transport\n Traffic Control Centre\n in Palestra\n.  \n&#xa0;\n2.15\n              \nWe have \nagreed activation and communications processes with \nthe LLACC\n, \n              \nwhich is managed by London Fire Brigade Emergency Planning.\n&#xa0;\nTesting \n&#xa0;\n2.16\n              \nTfL \n‘\nlive\n’\n tested \nour\n contingency responses to severe snow conditions\n on\n \n           the road network\n over two recent winter seasons with \nour \nRoads \nand Traffic \n           \nDirectorate\ns\n establishing a ‘snow desk’ for direct communication lines for \n           \npriority gritting \nrequests. Lessons learn\ned\n from this \napproach have been \n           incorporated into our procedures\n. During recent years an annual workshop \n           \nfacilitated by \nthe \nL\nondon \nF\nire and \nE\nmergency \nP\nlanning \nA\nuthority (LFEPA)\n has \n           \nbeen carried out with \nthe \nLondon boroughs, \nthe \nemergency services and \n           ourselves \nto share lessons learn\ned\n and best \npractice\n.\n \nWe facilitate\n and co-   \n           \nchairs regular meetings of the London Winter Service Practitioners Group, (a \n      \n     \nLoTAG\n sub–group) to share best practice and operational experiences in \n           \nanticipation of forthcoming adverse weather conditions.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.   London Underground and TfL’s rail network &#xa0;Weather forecasting\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n              \nTfL’s rail network \nand LU\n use the Met Office to predict levels of snowfall and ice accumulation\n as well as our own \nnetwork\n-wide\n rail temperature equipment. To complement this, MeteoGroup provide a forecast rail icing risk at over 20 locations over the LU network (the locations eac\nh have instrumented sets of rail for temperature and moisture, which give real time data). \nLondon \nR\nail\n collects local temperature informa\ntion from defined cold spot location\ns. This information \ntriggers the\n response plans\n as appropriate\n.\n&#xa0;\nOperational proces\nses\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nLU and L\nondon \nR\nail\n work on five day readiness proce\nss\n \nfor a predicted forecast of snow and a similar three day readiness process for ice, both of \nwhich aim to minimise the impact of the forecasted weather.  All affected rail routes are \npre-emptively treated in the hour\ns leading up to \nand then during \nwinter\n weather conditions\n in accordance with pre-determined plans\n. Where routes \nare affected\n, contingency plans are in place to divert customers and curtail rail services to concentrate on pr\niority locations. \n&#xa0;\nGritting and de-icing\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nD\nocklands \nL\night \nR\nailway \ngrit stocks are managed by\n the operator, Serco\n. \nThe company has\n detailed plans for grit/salt requirements, based on past experience. The main use is around stations, but depot walkways \nand external paths around office accommodation\n are treated\n. \nGrit \norders are \nplaced in August/September each year. On the platforms \n‘\nKillfrost\n’\n is also used\n and the required supplies have been ordered. \n&#xa0;\n3.4\n              \nLondon \nTram\nlink\n ha\ns\n already purchased the grit/sa\nlt \ni\nt plan\ns\n to use this year. \n              \nIt \npurchased \nits \nown \ndedicated \ngritting equipment in 2011. \n&#xa0;\n3.5\n              \nOn London Overground\n, the operator, London Rail Operations Ltd\n \n(\nLOROL\n),\n \n              \nis responsible for gritting or ‘I\ncemelt\n’\n applications at most of the stations. For \n              \nother infrastructure\n,\n Network Rail \nis\n responsible and there is clo\nse liaison \n              \nbetween LOROL and that organisation\n. \n&#xa0;\n3.6\n              \nFor LU\n,\n arrangements are in place for mutual aid with\n \nregard\n to gritting \nthose \n              \nvulnerable areas of streets outside stations and for tr\nain depot entry roads. \n              \nThis supports safe access to station and depot \n              \nroadways, car parks and staff \n              \nwalkways outside stations.\n&#xa0;\n3.7\n              \nAn audit of de-icing supplies (both materials and tools) at each station is \n              \ncompleted annually in September and orders a\nre placed for replenishments.  \n              \nContracts are in place to continually replenish stocks throughout the season \n              \n(within 24 hours of station reporting use), with buffer stocks held at strategic \n              \nlocations across the network.  \n&#xa0;\n3.8\n              \nOn both LU and L\nondon \nR\nail\n \ninfrastructure, de-icing fluid is laid by specially adapted trains. This activity is triggered by temperature and precipitation levels in the forecast.  These are tested prior to the season.\n \nEach \nUnderground \nline’s stock is typically equivalent to around o\nne week of intensive use, with contracts in place for supply of more fluid at short notice.\n&#xa0;\n3.9\n              \nIf snow is forecast, contracts are in place to obtain around 200 additional staff per shift to keep walkways clear, \n              \nallowing the full time staff to concentra\nte on specialist areas \n(such as \ncritical \nsets of points). \nThe T\nrain Operating Companies\n have similar contracts.\n \n&#xa0;\nCommand and control\n&#xa0;\n3.10\n              \nLU and L\nondon \nR\nail\n also \nuse the ‘Gold’, ‘Silver’, ‘Bronze’ structure.\n \nT\nhe LU Control Centre, \nlocated in Palestra\n,\n \nalongside its equivalent Surface Transpor\nt Operations and Control Centre\n (STOCC), \nallowing greater ability to \n              \nprovide a co-ordinated communication and command strategy\n across all transport modes\n.\n&#xa0;\nTesting \n&#xa0;\n3.12\n              \nLU restructured its planning systems in 201\n2 and this \n              \nprovides extensive \n              \nopportunities for testing. Going forward, network plans will be tested annually \n              \nafter their pre-winter review. Within regions on the network, plans are tested \n              \non a ‘walk through’ basis a number of times prior to the winter\n.  A pre-season \n              \naudit is carried out to ensure the preparation of the actions in the winter plan \n              \nis progressing to programme.   \n&#xa0;4.  Media and customer communication &#xa0;4.1\n              \nOur \nPress Office ha\ns\n a media strategy in place \nfor severe winter weather \n              \nwhich \ninclude\ns\n \ntravel \ninformation published on \nour website, \nnewspaper\ns\n, \n              \ntelevised feeds\n and social\n \nmedia\n. \n&#xa0;\n4.2\n              \nDealing with communications processes across London, and particularly how \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n         information is given to customers about our services, National Rail services \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n  and Highways Agency infrastructure, has been further developed following \n         \n  the 2012 Games.\n&#xa0;\n Apps for passengers are being developed utilising TfL     \n           data, via third parties, and strategies for communication and public \n           information being devised for pre-planned and anticipated events, which \n           in\ncludes adverse weather. Disruption to National Rail services creates \n           additional demands for our own operations as passengers switch to  \n           alternative routes. Better communication with Network Rail and the \nT\nrain \n      \n       \n         \n  \nO\nperating \nC\nompanies, with an \nemphasis on media messages, and \nadvance\n \n \n           notification will mitigate this. \n&#xa0;\n4.3      The value of multi-agency collaboration was clearly demonstrated by the \n           success of the Transport Coordina\ntion Centre\n (TCC) during the \n2012\n Games\n. \n           \nSince then we have improved the way we work\n with Network Rail and \n           \nother operators and have created\n a multi-agency coordination centre, \n \n           modelled \non the TCC, available to facilitate collaborative operational and \n           communications responses where required.\n&#xa0;\n5.  Lessons learned &#xa0;\n5.1\n              \nFollowing the severe weather in February 2009, TfL with the London \n              \nTechnical Advisors Group\n, set up a highway\ns winter service project \n              \nboard. \n              \nWe \nfacilitated a pan\n-\nLondon workshop which was attended by all London \n              \nb\noroughs. From this workshop and other meetings following the winter of \n              \n2009/10\n,\n London was one of the first areas in the UK to develop a \n              \ncarriageway\n treatment\n re\nsilience network. This is a sub-\nset of the main \n           \ntreatment\n networks, coordinated between boroughs to allow the most \n           \nimportant roads\n,\n including key bus routes\n,\n to operate when salt stocks are \n           \nlow. This network\n proved essential in managing the allocation of salt during \n           \nthe winter of \n              \n2009/10. At th\nat\n time TfL\n,\n through our contractors\n,\n manage\nd\n the \n           \ndistribution of salt supplies coming into London.\n&#xa0;\n5.2\n              \nWe \nha\nve\n also taken an active role in t\nhe \nPriority Gritting Request Review \n              \nwhich includes participation from \nthe \nLLACC, Local Authority Winter Service \n              \nManagers\n,\n the London Fire Brigade and London Ambulance Service. \n&#xa0;\n5\n.3\n              \nL\nU\n continue\ns\n to work closely with\n Network Rail, Train Operat\ning\n Companies\n, the Highways Agency, London \nboroughs \nand with other bodies. \nKey stakeholder engagement is also maintained via the London Resilience Forum with data being shared through a number of sources such as the National Resilience Extranet and the Transp\nort Sector Panel which is chaired by \nour\n \nHead of Resilience Planning.\n&#xa0;\n5\n.4\n              \nLines of communication with the Highways Agency have been improved since \n              \na particular problem on the M25 in winter \n20\n10/11 and the Highways Agency \n              \nha\ns\n taken steps to improve resilience on \nits\n network. \n&#xa0;\n6. Conclusion&#xa0;\n6\n.1\n              \nWe \ncontinue to work closely with colleagues in \na variety of agencies, including \n              \nthe\n London \nboroughs\n, to ensure our networks are able to operate safely and \n              \nreliably and to keep the \nCapital moving during severe winter weather.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n              \n              \n                     \n Local Government Technical Advisers’ Group\n"
