"&#xa0;\nWritten submission from Bill Manning (BRC 68)&#xa0;\nPart P seems a waste\n of time, very bureaucratic\n, any \nindividual can purchase \nelectrical accessories from say B&amp;Q, carry out electrical installations, \ntheoretically only \njust need to sub\nmit building notice to comply.Â  \n&#xa0;\nPart P is if applied is reactive \nrather than proactive, if non-qualified person install, may not notify Building Control, and how do you evaluate an installation after completion, h\nard to see if electrics comp\nly with BS after installation by potential novice.\n&#xa0;\nI strongly believe that \nelect\nrical works should only be carried out by qualified electricians, \nneed something like gas safe legislation.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
