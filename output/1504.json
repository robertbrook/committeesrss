"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by ADS (RaD0018)&#xa0;About ADS&#xa0;\nADS is the trade organisation representing the UK aerospace, defence, security and space \nindustries. Farnborough International Limited (FIL), which runs the Farnborough International \nAirshow\n, is a wholly-owned subsidiary. ADS has offices in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, France and India. ADS comprises over 900 member companies within th\ne industries it represents, of which over 850 are small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Together with its regional partners, ADS represents over 2,600 companies across the UK supply chain.\n&#xa0;\nADS also supports the Aerospace Growth Partnership, SC21, Sustainab\nle Aviation, Defence Industries Council, RISC and hosts the Aerospace &amp; Defence Knowledge Transfer Network.\n&#xa0;Background to the ADS sectors&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Summary&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1. Is the UK globally competitive and attractive to potential investors?&#xa0;1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \ncurrent \nsuccess of UK industry is largely based on significant \nprevious \ninvestment\ns\n in \ninnovation\n. \nThroughout\n \nthe past century, ground-breaking research has been exploited by UK industry\n:\n pulled\n through from \nearly development phases to \nmanufacturing\n.\n. This has \nenabled UK industry to compete as one of the leading players in a global technology race.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nO\nver the past two decades, \nhowever, ADS believes that \nthe UK’s competitive advantage \nin innovation \nhas been \ngradually \neroded\n.\n Although the recent industrial strategies are helping to close this competitiveness gap, the UK still lags behind the strategic focus and efficiency of others innovation policies\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nR\nesearch by \nNesta\n suggests that th\ne UK has been under-investing in innovation by over £38bn each year.\n \nIn addition, business investment remains 25% below pre-recession levels. \nPart of the problem is that\n \nt\nhe recent, and indeed needed, focus on industrial strategies\n is\n not being supported \nby \nthe UK’\ns tax, skills and immigration \nregime\ns \nthat \nare globally uncompetitive \nfor investment in R&amp;D and technology. \n&#xa0;\n1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOn support for innovation, \nthe UK is \ncurrently \n14\nth\n in the OECD and G20 for tax support for R&amp;D, 28\nth\n for tax support for innovative machinery and 41\nst\n for support for new manufacturing facilities\n,\n which as discussed later, are an inseparable part of the high-value manufacturing innovation process. \n&#xa0;\n1.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn terms of engineering skills, the UK ranks 24\nth\n in t\nhe OECD for engineers as a percentage of all graduates. This leaves the UK facing shortage of almost 60,000 \ngraduate \nengineers each year.\n \n&#xa0;\n1.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNor have successive government\ns\n’\n policies on immigration recognised the importance of highly-skilled immigra\ntion to\n the UK and the negative-\nimpact\n of excluding skilled workers from our economy. Currently, almost 30% of all engineering graduates are from outside the UK, and current policies and rhetoric on immigration make it difficult for these much needed skills to re\nmain\n in\n the UK after graduation.\n&#xa0;\n1.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe UK’s existing funding for R&amp;D, in particular in the science and research base, is also fragmented, reducing the impact of otherwise high-\nquality rese\na\nr\nch. \nFor example, b\noth UK industry and other researchers have limite\nd visibility of research taking place at UK universities and certainly no overall picture of research taking place \nwithin industry\n, valuable to their own technological aims. This lack of visibility also prevents industry from accessing and exploiting the w\norld-class research taking place on its doorstep.\n&#xa0;\n1.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMoreover, inaccessible research will cause valuable investment from UK businesses in the development stage to go abroad. Potential UK investment is instead often invested in research taking place at foreig\nn research hubs, taking with it jobs (including highly-skilled, high gross value added (GVA) employment). This would weaken the UK’s skills base and, furthermore, reduce investment opportunities for further research in the UK. Lack of access to research ha\ns a knock-on effect, curtailing investment in UK capability and potentially damaging the next generation of research and skills.\n&#xa0;\n1.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGrowth Partnerships between industry and government, such as the successful Aerospace Growth Partnership (AGP), are working to\n improve this situation. Long-term, focussed government commitments to research infrastructure funding will encourage industry co-investment. Industry business plans work to ten years ahead and it is vital that government funding can transcend electoral cy\ncles and match these timescales to give industry the confidence to co-invest. Cross party support for industrial strategies and growth partnerships such as the AGP, Defence Growth Partnership (DGP) and Security and Resilience Growth Partnership (SRGP), is \nessential for industry to ensure its long-term investment decisions are safeguarded from changes in political priorities\n&#xa0;\n1.10\n \nAs Western countries place a greater emphasis on high-tech, advanced manufacturing, the UK will be at a disadvantage to countries \nwhose research infrastructure is more integrated such as the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) and the French ONERA. As centres of excellence at critical mass of research infrastructure, the DLR and ONERA are better able to attract global industrial investment\n and leverage additional EU funding.\n&#xa0;\n1.11\n \nThis focus on generating critical mass in existing R&amp;D funding must also be supported by step-change improvements in wider innovation policy landscape, including the corporate tax regime and an innovation friendly skil\nls pipeline. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2. Does the UK’s innovation policy place sufficient focus on applied R&amp;D and exploitation?&#xa0;2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUK innovation policy under successive Governments has not fully recognised the different R&amp;D models under which the UK’s high tech industries \noperate. This has led to funding streams generally following the R&amp;D model required by the pharmaceutical industry – one that has a proportionally large investment in research – over the model required by the engineering industries – with a proportionally \nlarge investment in development. The imbalance of annual \nfunding between Research Councils – c.£3bn – and the Technology Strategy Board\n (TSB)\n – under £400m – demonstrates this.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs \ndepicted\n in Figure 1 below, the focus on research in the pharmaceutical ind\nustry is far great\ner than the developmental stage. In contrast, the innovation model in \nindustrie\ns such as aerospace or defence \nrequire\ns\n a much \nfar \ngreater investment in \nthe design and \ndevelopment\n phases\n. Unlike the pharmaceutical R&amp;D model, the aerospace \nand defence industries rely on large scale demonstrators for the development of their products, taking\n laboratory research through costly technology development and manufacturing \ndevelopment phases. \nLikewise, as the equipment being produced through the eng\nineering R&amp;D model is safety critical, demonstrators are vital in testing components both individually and connected, throu\nghout the manufacturing process.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe 7-8\n time\n greater Government funding for Research Councils relative to the TSB means that the UK\n government\n limited\n R&amp;D grants and funding are far more likely to support research-intensive innovation and provide insufficient support to industries with development-intensive innovation models.\n&#xa0;\nFigure 1 – R&amp;D models differ by sector&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis bias towards research-intensive R&amp;D processes is reinforced by the UK’s corporate tax regime. As noted above, the UK is not globally competitive in-terms of supporting R&amp;D and capital investment through the tax regime.  Incentives that do exist within\n the regime, in particular the new Patent Box, also have an in-built bias towards certain types of innovation models. By providing a discounted corporate tax rate on income generated from patents, the Patent Box provides benefits to products with low-techn\nological complexity and shallow innovation supply-chains (albeit with high scientific and research complexity). \n&#xa0;\n2.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor example, once a drug has been proven, it is relatively easy to patent and produce, and so to identify \nincome \ngenerated from a patent for t\nax purposes. It is far more complicated to identify the income generated from a patented technology embedded within an engine or aircraft. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3. Is there a sufficient level of funding for R&amp;D in the UK?&#xa0;\n3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs highlighted in the NAO report ‘Research and Devel\nopment funding for science and technology in the UK’, the UK has had a consistently low percentage of GDP spent on R&amp;D over the last 20 years, considerably lower than most rival nation competitors in the industries ADS represents.\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs shown in Figure 2 below, since the recession, the UK has fallen behind key OECD competitors in terms of Government spending on all R&amp;D across the economy and has in fact reduced R&amp;D spending as a proportion of GDP since 2007. \nThis has left the UK at 21st in the OECD for Government spending and support on all R&amp;D programmes. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFigure 2 – Government Budget Appropriations and Outlays on R&amp;D, weighted by size of the economy, 2007=100\nSource: \nNesta\n and OECD\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nConsequently, the\n UK still has a long way to go to reach the Europe 2020 target of \n3%\n of GDP spent on R&amp;D, as also raised in the NAO report.\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBy removing capital spend from the ring-fenced science budget, the infrastructure at which research takes place is also threatened.\n Laboratory based teaching is far more expensive than the classroom-based equivalent and with falling capital spending; science infrastructure is an easy target for universities looking to save money.\n&#xa0;\n3.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSMEs often face prohibitive costs to use test faciliti\nes for the purpose of trialling, experimenting and developing their innovative technology in real-life environments. The lack of funding spent on development in comparison to research further hinders progress in the engineering sectors \nADS represents where\n the R&amp;D model they are operating under requires far greater funding for development than initial research.\n&#xa0;\n3.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe 1.2\n%\n minimum spend on Science and Technology (S&amp;T) in the defence budget set by the Government in the National Security through Technology Whit\ne Paper in February 2012 will halt the spiralling decrease in the defence S&amp;T budget over the past two decades. It is important that this figure is not treated as a target but is built upon to increase the spend on S&amp;T and ensure the UK is not left behind \nby other nations investing more in the development of future equipment. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4. Is there an efficient funding process for R&amp;D in the UK?&#xa0;\n4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDespite the advantages afforded to UK manufacturing in the past through the competitive research system under the Haldan\ne Principle, the fragmented funding streams through which universities apply do not provide sufficient critical mass and are unaligned to the UK’s new Growth Partnerships. Due to such localised decision making, research is taking place at a sub-critical le\nvel across many universities, with many institutions’ research priorities overlapping.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIndividual, localised research proposals from UK universities are often effective at attaining EU funding; however, further external investment into \nstovepiped\n research programmes reinforces the UK’s fragmented research capability. A failure to act with on\ne voice through central research hubs leaves the UK unable to leverage and spend EU funding as effectively as possible. \n&#xa0;\n4.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs funding is spread too thinly, the UK risks duplicating funding on research and weakening research outcomes that could have been con\nsiderably strengthened through aggregated funding, from a large number of low-funded programmes to a select, well-funded development-focussed few. Duplicated research further serves to hamper exploitation and will miss opportunities to attract global inves\ntment.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nNESTA (2012), \nPlan I: The case for innovation-led growth.\n OECD Science and Technology Indicators and Economic Indicators for MSTI\n Centre for Business Taxation (2012), \nCBT Corporate Tax Ranking 2012.\n \nRAE (2012), \nJobs and Growth: The importance of engineering skills to the UK economy.\n NESTA (2012\n).\n \nCBT (2012)\n.\n RAE (2012)\n.\n"
