defaultThere’s no question that, when asked to choose which issue is most important, more people now say “the economy” and fewer say “environmental issues” than before the financial crisis. At its January 2007 peak, 19 per cent of the population rated the environment as the most important issue facing the country. In the face of the economic downturn, this has slid to below four per cent.

defaultGiven the dramatic nature of the economic crisis, the direct effects felt by many, and the sustained media focus, it is hardly surprising that, when asked to choose one issue, people choose this. But, as Paul Flattery, managing partner at trend analysts Trajectory has said, “this doesn’t mean that people don’t care” about the environment and climate change. In fact, in 2010, 71 per cent of people were still very concerned or fairly concerned about climate change, and two thirds believe that it poses risks to people in Britain.
