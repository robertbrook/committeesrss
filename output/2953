[normal]I welcome the opportunity to submit evidence to this Committee. I have been researching youth (
[normal]un)
[normal]employment in the UK and wider EU since before the financial crisis. My research agenda focuses on locating UK challenges and initiatives within the broader, comparative context of our closest competitors. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]One of the most extensive pieces of research I have undertaken was 
[normal]an
[normal] EU27 comparative study of initiatives by social partners (employers and unions) and governments to help young people in the aftermath of the crisis. This took the form of commissioning a narrative report from expert correspondents in each member state, and then compiling a comparative analysis.

[normal]This research, and more recent work on employer behaviour, informs this submission.

[normal]Do you think that the EU should be providing funding to Member States to tackle youth unemployment? Does EU action respect Member States’ powers in the area of social and employment affairs? [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How do you think that the EU can best ‘add value’ to Member States’ efforts to tackle unemployment? [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Is there sufficient disaggregation in EU measures to tackle youth unemployment between, for example, support for young people classified [bold]as being not in education, employment or training (‘NEETs’), support for newly qualified graduates looking for work, and general career guidance? [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Are the EU’s accounting, monitoring and evaluation procedures sufficient to be able to determine whether EU funded projects to tackle youth unemployment have been successful or not? Are there ways in which they could be improved? [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How do you think the funds allocated through the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) and the European Social Fund (ESF) could best be spent? [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Do you feel that young people (aged 15-24), youth groups and their representatives are involved and consulted to a satisfactory degree in the decisions being made around EU funding for youth unemployment projects, and how they are administered? [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How can the EU and Member States embrace new technologies and new methods of working to combat youth unemployment? [bold]&#xa0;
