[[[Written evidence from the Police and Crime Commissioner for Dyfed-Powys [CST0057]]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;Thank you for your letter dated the 6th December 2013 asking Police and Crime Commissioners to respond the following questions:&#xa0;&#xa0;I have answered each below.&#xa0;&#xa0;I believe this has begun to reduce pressure on the system to produce favourable figures and encouraged better professional judgment. This may result in crime figures rising. I will monitor this very carefully. I am prepared to accept this if it provides a better reflection of reality.&#xa0;Target-based performance culture is deeply embedded within the police. Changing it will take time and leadership. My Chief Constable is committed to improving leadership and I have agreed to investment to this end where necessary. I do not expect crime and detection recording practices to change fast, however.&#xa0;&#xa0;Since taking up office I have sought to increase the transparency of police performance.Â  We hold monthly performance boards and have established an Out of Court Disposal Scrutiny Panel, which assesses the use of cautions. The Chief Constable and I are exploring partnerships with academia, with College of Policing backing, to improve the quality of our performance work. This will bring greater independence, breadth and analysis to assessments of police and local criminal justice system performance.&#xa0;Crime statistics will always be subject to political and organisational pressure. They are undoubtedly useful but must be treated with caution and understood in context. They must also be considered alongside other information, particularly qualitative assessments.&#xa0;&#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;
