&#xa0;Written evidence from Janet Erskine (TIC 17)Great Chishill in South Cambridgeshire has only one weekday bus service to Cambridge and Addenbrooke’s hospital (one outward in the morning and 2 inward in the evening).  This bus is at the moment subsidised by Cambs CC.  This subsidy is soon to be withdrawn.  Cambridegeshire County Council has as yet not come up with an alternative service to take 6th formers to their colleges or workers from the village into work or to the Cambridge railway station.Because the village is on the cusp of 3 counties (Cambridgeshire, Hertfordshire and Essex) there is an early morning bus service under contract to Hertfordshire which goes from Great Chishill to Royston railway station on school days only.Great Chishill cannot be left without an adequate public transport service to Cambridge.&#xa0;August 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
