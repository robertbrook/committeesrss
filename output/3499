defaultWRITTEN defaultEdefaultVIDENCEdefault FROM THE COMMITTEE ON STANDARDS INdefault PUBLIC LIFE [CST0006]default&#xa0;default1. The Committee on Standards in Public Life is pleased to have an opportunity to respond to the Public Administration Select Committee’s (PASC) call for evidence on the reporting of police performance indicators.  
defaultThe 
defaultCommittee
default welcomes the decision of PASC to carry out their investigation into crime statistics
default, which was
default announced on 16
default 
defaultOctober
default,
default as part of their wider investigation into statistics and their use in Government
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultBackgrounddefault2. The Committee on Standards
default in
default Public Life is defined by its Seven Principles of Standards in Public L
defaultife which are Selflessness, Objectivity, Integrity, Accountability, Openness, Honesty and Leadership. 
default&#xa0;
default3. In 1994, when the Committee was established, its terms of reference were:
default“To examine current concerns about standards of conduct of all holders of public office, including arrangements relating to financial and commercial activities, and make recommendations as to any changes in present arrangements which might be required to e
defaultnsure the highest standards of propriety in public life. It was stated that “Public office should include: ministers, civil servants and advisers; Members of Parliament and UK Members of the European Parliament; members and senior officers of all non-depar
defaulttmental public bodies and of national health service bodies; non-ministerial office holders; members and other senior officers of other bodies discharging publicly-funded functions; and elected members and senior officers of local authorities.
default” The Commit
defaulttee’s terms
default 
defaultwere extended in 2013 to include
default “defaultanyone who works as a public office-holder. This includes all those who are elected or appointed to public office, nationally and locally, and all people appointed to work in the civil service, local government
default, the police, courts and probation services, NDPBs, and in the health, education, social and care services.
default” 
default&#xa0;
default4. We have for some time been interested in the debate around the application of the Seven Principles of Public Life to policing. The Committee 
defaulthas been closely watching ethical risks in the police. As we said in 
defaultthe Committee’s
default Annual Report in 2012/13, the Committee will
default keep a watching brief on “Ethical standards in the police, including Police and 
defaultCrime Commissioners.” In 
defaultour work plan 2013/14
default we said
default, “We will continue to monitor a number of issues, including, the behaviour and conduct of the police.
default” As part of that
default 
defaultwork plan
default, the Committee has met with
default Police and Crime Commissioners to 
defaultdiscuss how they can best assist them in 
defaultpre-
defaultempt
defaulting
default an
defaulty ethical risks they may face in their new roles. 
defaultThe Committee’s response to the consultation therefore focuses primarily on the fourth question: Has enough been done to ensure the integrity of crime data? What more should be done?default&#xa0;defaultIntegrity of crime dadefaulttadefault5. It has been reported that the level of crime has fallen in recent years. The Office for National Statistics 
default(ONS) 
defaultreported on 17 October 2013 that the headline estimate for crimes against households and resident adults was down 7% compared with the 
defaultprevious year’s survey
default. Fewer crimes are solved because there are fewer crimes
default committed
default. However, there have long been concerns about the accuracy of these crime statistics. Her Majesty’s Inspector of Constabulary (HMIC) reported in 1999 on ‘gaming’ prac
defaulttices and their effect on statistics. 
defaultI
defaultt was admitted that the recorded figures in the Office for National Statistics National Crime Survey, reported in January 2
default0
default13
default might be defective since the ONS
default relies on figures reported 
defaultto them 
defaultby 
defaultpolice
default forces
default. 
defaultAccu
defaultrate reporting of crime data is essential in order to put in place resources to deal with crime and its effects adequately. 
defaultAs David Blunkett, the then Home Secretary said “It is important to measure crime accurately if we are to be able to tackle it effec
defaulttively” (July 2001, cited in Simmons 
defaultet al
default 2003
default). Accurate statistics reporting is also vital for the Government to meet its objective of increasing transparency around data in order for the public to be accurately informed of crime nationally 
defaultand 
defaultin thei
defaultr 
defaultown 
defaultarea. 
default&#xa0;
default6. Performance management was introduced into the police force from the late 1980s and was designed to increase competency and accountability by measuring performance. There is a tradition of serious academic work which engages critically som
defaulte of the perverse effects of a targets culture within the police service in recent years
default. Loveday wrote that: “...the use of ‘gaming’ techniques now characterise the operation of most public service managers.” He concluded that this leads to a performance
default culture in order to meet these targets
default. Tom Winsor, 
defaultHe
defaultr Majesty's Chief Inspector of 
defaultConstabulary
default,
default 
defaultgave evidence to 
defaultthe Home Affairs Committee (HAC) for their report ‘Leadership and standards in the police’ that the Police Federation
default themselves
default had raise
defaultd concerns about the reporting of crime statistics.
default 
default&#xa0;
default7. The phenomenon of 
default‘gam
defaulting’
default statistics is widespread in public life and not just confined to the police, 
defaultproblems have also been noted in healthcare
default. Dr Patrick nevertheless notes some problematic 
defaultforms of ‘gaming’ particularly within the police. He talks of ‘cuffing’, so called after the magician’s act of making things disappear up the sleeve. The operation of cuffing allows some forms of crime figures to disappear altogether by, for instance, not 
defaultrecording some types at all
default. On the process known as ‘nodding’ figures are improved by getting offenders to nod to other offences to be taken into consideration. In the House of Lords debate on police performance management indicators, introduced by the E
defaultarl of Lytton on 19 March 2013
default Lord Condon declared
default 
default“During my first few weeks as Chief Constable of Kent, I had to deal with a major discipline case involving Kent detectives who had been visiting burglars in prison. Through various inducements such as t
defaultaking them out for the day, letting them meet their girlfriends and extra cigarettes, the detectives got them to admit to crimes they had not committed, thus fundamentally impairing the Kent detection figures.”
default Dr Patrick also speaks of ‘stitching’- the p
defaultractice of coercing suspects to confess crimes with threats or by offering more lenient treatment. Finally, Dr Patrick describes the practice of skewing, this involves applying resources solely to whatever targets are being measured to the exclusion of oth
defaulters.
default&#xa0;
default8
default. 
defaultFurther r
defaultesearch supports the idea that ‘gaming’ behaviour is an organisational problem resulting from targets rather than initiated by individuals. The behaviour is also linked to scandals. For example, in 1995 when the Chief Constable in Manche
defaultster stopped striking deals with offenders b
defaultefore sentencing
default 
defaultknown as ‘write offs’
default, the detection rate fell from 33% in 1994/5 to 18% in 1996/7
default. The noticeable impact of this action underlines how ‘gaming’ practices can undermine crime statistics and render them unreliable. 
default&#xa0;default9. 
defaultThis Committee wrote that “integrity means that 
defaultholders of public office should not act or take decisions in order to g
defaultain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends.” Applying this principle to crime statistics therefore means that public office-holders and organisations should consistently and reliably recording statistics in a wa
defaulty that promotes openness, accountability and establishes robust mechanisms for detecting and dealing with wrongdoing. 
default&#xa0;
default10
default. 
defaultThe Committee acknowledges that some work in this area has already been done through the overseeing of 
defaultpolice recorded crime figures
default 
defaultby Home Office statisticians who 
defaultexamine data to identify anomalies or 
defaultinconsistencies and 
defaultrefer issues
default to the police force concerned for clarification
default. The National Crime Registrar also advises both police forces and HMIC 
defaulton the application of the rules
default. The Committee considers that there is still work to be done and two options may be considered useful solutions for increasing the reliability of crime statistics. The first is independent supervision of data and 
defaultthe second is independent auditing of the 
defaultdata. The first option is already taking place to some degree and t
defaulthe second could be considered in order to give some assurances as to the reliability of data, ensure any biases are rooted out and allow rebuilding of trust in the data. 
default&#xa0;defaultLeadership issuesdefault              default11. The Committee notes with interest that Dr Patrick argues that the solution to ‘gaming’ lies in reforming current police regulatory framework and governance arrangements in relation to crime statistics
default. Several police officers have become whistleblow
defaulters on ‘gaming’ statistics, which could be indicative of a desire for change within the police itself. However, in order to do this, whistleblowers must be given adequate protection. Independent research published by this committee found that respondents w
defaultanted protection for whistleblowing and external regulators for organisations (whether public or private sector). Encouraging a culture where people are not afraid to report wrongdoing (66% for large public sector organisations and 53% for private sector) 
defaultwas seen as particularly important for promoting probity
default. This Committee has previously said that “A culture that encourages the challenge of inappropriate behaviour at all levels requires visible, robust and effective leadership in order to ensure that h
defaultigh ethical standards are taken seriously.
default” 
default&#xa0;default12
default. 
defaultG
defaultood leadership and governance is the key to ensuring integrity of crime data. 
defaultThe Committee fully accepts that most people who work in policing are honourable, ded
defaulticated and hard working. Indeed
default it is our
default Public Attitudes Survey
default which shows the high regard in which the police are held.
default Over 60% of respondents reported that they trusted the police to tell the truth in 2011, with only judges rated more highly
default. A
default more recent poll conducted by YouGov has sho
defaultwn that trust in police is declining. The number of respondents who trust senior police officers has decreased from 72% in 2003 to 49% in 2012
defaultand a
default quarter (26%) of those surveyed by ComRes in 2013 said the “plebgate” affair has made them less likely to trust the police.
default 
default&#xa0;
default13
default. 
defaultAs 
defaultwe 
defaultdiscussed in Standards Matter
default, the p
defaultrinciple of leadership underlines the importance of setting a good example, promo
defaultting high standards and 
defaultchallenging p
defaultoor behaviour
default. 
defaultWe 
defaulthighlighted the value
default of proactive governance and visible leadership in ensuring high ethical standards in organisations when we said, “Exemplifying high standards is particularly important for those in management positions. It is even more so for those at the very top, becaus
defaulte it is they who set the tone for an organisation.” Lord Justice Leveson made the same point in his report: “...
defaultin a hierarchical organisation such as the police, the tone is set from the top, and how leaders behave will have an obvious filtering effect ri
defaultght through the force
default.
default 
defaultElizabeth Filkin has previously
default commented on the behaviour of senior managers in the police: 
default“I am concerned by the extent to which police officers and staff feel that some of their senior leaders abide by a different set of rules..
default. There has been no clear standard set by the senior team for police officers and staff to use as a guide for their own behaviour and in some instances the standards set have been poor and have led to consequent damage.
default”
default&#xa0;
default14. Police and Crime Commissioner
defaults (PCCs) have a role in ensuring the integrity of crime data 
defaultin their new position
defaults
default as ethical leaders. As the Home Secretary has said “e
defaultlected Police and Crime Commissioners now provide local accountability for police forces.
default”
default 
defaultPolice and Crime Commissioners are democratically elected leaders and are responsible for holding 
defaulttheir local police force to account
default. We would expect that to include holding Chief Constables, who compile the 
defaultpolice 
defaultstatistics
default,
default to account for the quality a
defaultnd accuracy of the information. PCCs are ultimately held accountable at the ballot box, as the public may choose not to re-elect a PCC they have lost
default 
defaulttrust and 
defaultconfidence
default in. 
default&#xa0;default15
default. 
defaultFinally, we 
defaultwelcome the publication of the College of Policing draft code of ethics
defaultand are
default pleased at the adoption of the Seven Principles of Public L
defaultife. We do however wish to reiterate in conclusion that the 
defaultSeven Princip
defaultles, especially those of leadership
default, accountability and integrity apply to the production of crime statistics as well as to other areas of policing. 
defaultIt appears to us that this debate must include a more express assessment of the state of play with respect 
defaultto th
defaulte accuracy of police statistics.
