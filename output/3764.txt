[[[Written Evidence Submitted by David Hodson (Senior)]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]I have the online recording of the House of Commons Communities andLocal Government hearing on building regulations applying to electrical installationsand repairs in dwellings, that was held on 2nd September, and am writing tocomment.&#xa0;I am 64 years old and am currently working as a self employed electrician. I served my electrical/electronics apprenticeship in the Royal Corps of Signalsand have had a career in electronics ever since.&#xa0;I semi retired in January 2010 but decided that I needed to carry on working untilat least I was 65. My chosen path was as an electrician. It turned out to be quitean ordeal having to go back to college (albeit by correspondence) and having to learnall the regulations that go with working with electricity.&#xa0;Having succeeded in gaining the relevant qualifications by September 2010, I hadthen to join a 'competent persons' scheme' in order to work on 'notifiable' installations. But which one? This was a question asked by one of the select committee members and none of the four in the 'dock' seemed to be able to give a straight answer.&#xa0;As an outsider and very ignorant of the industry, I chose NAPIT. It could well havebeen any other but their fees seemed to be mid-range.&#xa0;The choice should not have been there. There should be only one scheme that promotes the raising of standards by those working in the industry at the sametime raising the general awareness of the public and one 'flag' under which we all sail.&#xa0;I get most of my work by advertising in the local press. I do subscribe to other marketingwebsites (both of which were mentioned in committee) but these bring in very little work.So I always ask my customers why they chose my ad over the others and it's usuallybecause it stands out. Nothing to do with part P, NAPIT or NICEIC. The public justdo not know. They all know about CORGI though and GasSafe.&#xa0;I don't really care what the flag is. Electric Safe or Electrical Safety. But there should onlybe one.&#xa0;Please bang their heads together and make them work together, although I think they will try to put as many obstacles in the way as possible.&#xa0;A very easy solution is to put the control into the Local Authority Building Control, just as we have done for personal licences in the liquor trade, and issue a similar licence tooperate. No licence, no work.&#xa0;25 November 2013&#xa0;
