[[[Written evidence submitted by the UKDEA (HOT22)]]]

[[[About the UK District Energy Association]]]The partners, owners and operators of the largest district energy schemes in the UK have aligned themselves in the creation of the UK District Energy Association (UKDEA); with the aim of not only promoting district energy as a means to deliver significant carbon savings, but also to establish a direct link between the Government and the industry's small market base. The Association is a not for profit, non-trade association of companies and public sector organizations involved or interested in district energy schemes of all sizes, from village scale, community based 'micro district energy' schemes to city wide district heat energy networks. Still in its infancy, the UKDEA has attracted leading players in the industry with a current membership comprising of 56 organisations including some international members.Through Full and Associate membership, the UK District Energy Association's aim is to represent current and potential owners, developers, consumers, partners, operators, product suppliers and interested parties of District Energy schemes throughout the UK.&#xa0;

[[[Response to Energy and Climate Change Committee Inquiry i]]]

[[[nto Heat- August 2013.]]]The UK District Energy Association (UKDEA) welcomes the opportunity to respond to this parliamentary inquiry into heat.The UKDEA believes that the inquiry (through the examination of stakeholder views) will lead to further understanding of the key aspects to heat, which are:As one of the UKDEA’s primary commitments relates to enabling the greater use of district energy where this is beneficial, we have provided responses to parts of the inquiry we felt were most relevant to district/community energy. We believe that this focused response will be more beneficial to the committee as it draws on our particular knowledge base with respect to district energy.&#xa0;District Energy systems are systems that produce hot or chilled water at a central source for distribution through a network of below ground pre- insulated pipework to consumers connected to the energy network system. Whilst the term community energy has been used in the past to mean district energy, it is now only used to refer to local energy systems of any type that have been implemented by community groups.                                                                                         &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Question: ]]]

[[[Why is community heating/CHP not more common in the ]]]

[[[UK]]]

[[[?]]]&#xa0;

[[[Response]]]

[[[: ]]]District heating is not more common within the UK for both historical and more recent reasons. Although

[[[ ]]]district heating has enormous economic and technical potential within the UK, its development within the UK has lagged behind that of Europe. District heating has been deployed within the UK since the 1950s; however its popularity began to wane due to rapidly rising fuel costs in the aftermath of the 1973 oil crisis particularly as most schemes at the time were oil fired. Furthermore the availability of a relatively cheap supply of indigenous North Sea gas, reduced the UK’s inclination to focus on increased energy efficiency measures, such as district heating, at a time when many European countries with  no such supplies had little option but to look at increased energy efficiency measures including district heating.Additionally the poor management and low quality of installation of the earlier installed district heating schemes made many of them unreliable. In contrast, modern pre-insulated pipes and installation technologies result in networks that are reliable over many decades.&#xa0;While there is huge potential for greater deployment of district heating across the UK the relatively small market means that the market for installers remains small and uncompetitive. Added to this is the very high price of installation which makes it hard for many district heating schemes to be financially viable.A sustainable funding mechanism could accelerate the deployment of district heating, making the market more competitive, reducing costs. Sustainable funding mechanisms would also achieve more than previous grant funding programmes which were invariably closed part way through the advertised timetable and which led to feast and famine delivery of networks.&#xa0;The UKDEA believes that support could be in the form of a Heat Networks Incentive or a loan or grant mechanism to accelerate the market’s development and the further expansion of the UK’s district heating networks, as outlined in the UKDEA’s policy proposals  to DECC in July 2011 and 2012 (See Appendix 2).&#xa0; In addition to issues related to public funding, the UKDEA believes that the provision of policy certainty for investors in low carbon heat generation could also play a crucial role in providing a stable policy framework and a more enabling environment for further investment in low carbon heat networks. &#xa0;A further hindrance to the wider deployment of district heating schemes has been the effects of current government policy (coupled with austerity) on local authorities. Local authorities often provide leadership and drive in the establishment of heat networks within their respective areas and any cuts or reductions to their functions will often result in the shelving or abandoning of planned projects including district heating schemes.&#xa0;Another equally important reason why district heating may not be more common in the UK is the perceived risk involved in making an investment in district heating. Developers and investors may perceive investing in other technologies as relatively less risky by comparison to investing in district heating projects. Again the development of a more mature market for district heating can help overcome this barrier.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Question: ]]]

[[[What will the local environmental impact (for example air pollution) be from the use heat generation in urban areas, for example CHP units?]]]&#xa0;

[[[Response:]]]

[[[ ]]]A diverse range of technologies can be utilised to generate heat within urban areas and many of these can be linked to heat networks. These technologies include CHP, biomass boilers, deep geothermal and heat pumps. In situations where these technologies replace old and polluting plant locally, their use results in improved energy efficiency and a subsequent reduction in carbon emissions and improvement in air quality. The use of CHP with district heating for instance has led to substantial carbon savings on some schemes run by UKDEA members. 

[[[Figure 1]]] below shows the increasing carbon savings made by three district heating schemes over a number of years. The three schemes- Birmingham, Cofely East London Energy (Olympic Park) and Leicester district heating schemes are all operated by UKDEA members.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Fig 1: ]]]Showing total CO2 savings made by Birmingham, CELE (Olympic Park) &amp; Leicester district heating schemes from 2008 to 2012.The deployment in urban areas of decentralised energy generating technologies can lead to a localised increase in the emission of pollutants such as nitrogen –oxides (NOx) or particulate matter (PM), depending on the generation technology chosen. The use of Best Available Technologies and the efficient operation of technology should still lead to a reduction in pollutants compared to conventional heat and electricity generation.&#xa0;As many of our members’ operations involve partnering local authorities in the provision of low carbon heat, the improvement of local air quality standards assumes even greater importance as it helps our local authority partners meet the requirements of their respective Local Air Quality Management (LAQM) systems and ultimately the legally binding EU air quality standards at national level. &#xa0;In addition the generation of heat locally through energy from waste schemes within some urban areas has in cases helped alleviate the problem of urban waste disposal whilst simultaneously helping provide low cost heating locally. Over recent years the Coventry Energy from waste plant has led to notable reductions in the volumes of waste destined for landfill through the increased heat recovery from such waste. Heat recovery from this scheme resulted in initial carbon savings of around 2000 tonnes. Based on the calculations of the UKDEA involved with the scheme, heat supplied to consumers from this scheme will result in consumers making a 5% financial saving relative to the conventional alternative.&#xa0;Deep geothermal heat, such as that currently utilised in the Southampton district heating scheme and also planned for Manchester city centre is a renewable resource and has low spatial requirements thus making it ideally suited to city centre locations where space is at a premium. This helps reduce its local environmental impact.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Question: ]]]

[[[Thermal storage is a potential useful method of balancing electricity/energy dem]]]

[[[and both diurnally and annually.]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[ What is government policy doing to promote thermal storage, and should it do more/different?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Response: ]]]The UKDEA agrees that thermal storage is a potentially useful method of balancing electricity/energy demand and will therefore welcome any government policy in support of thermal storage. Thermal storage will allow energy generated during periods of low heat demand to be stored and later released when households require heat.However we are presently unaware of any government policy promoting thermal storage.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Question:]]] 

[[[Should the government take any further any specific actions in relation to cooling?]]]&#xa0;

[[[Response:]]]

[[[ ]]]As the wider effects of climate change begin to translate into more frequent episodes of very high temperatures over the UK summer period, there is a need for greater focus on the provision of efficient cooling systems. Although the Government has rightly focused on the provision of low cost and low carbon heating, the UKDEA believes that Government can do more with respect to the provision of efficient cooling. The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive makes provision for strategies that enhance the thermal performances of buildings during the summer period (to be given priority) so as to avoid issues such as overheating. In addition to increased emphasis on passive cooling techniques, district cooling may provide an efficient means of cooling both old and new building stock. Economies of scale mean that large scale district cooling plant can achieve substantial carbon and cost savings compared to a proliferation of small scale air-conditioning split units in urban areas.&#xa0;

[[[Question: What are the relative merits of using gas to directly provide space heating compared to centralised electricity producti]]]

[[[on plus domestic heat pumps?   ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Response:]]]

[[[ ]]]The use of electricity alone in the provision of space heating is not a sensible option. Using centralised electricity and domestic heat pumps to provide space heating (in place of gas and other energy sources) would result in the failure of the electricity grid to cope with the resulting increased demand placed on it especially during times of high heat demand such as the cold winter periods. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Fig 2]]]: Showing a comparison of national heat and electricity demand variability across a year (domestic and commercial)-2010.

[[[Source]]]: DECC, The Future of Heating: A strategic framework for low carbon heat in the UK, March 2012. &#xa0;The use of gas to provide space heating therefore still has significant merit as it substantially reduces demand on an electricity grid already struggling to cope with existing demand as illustrated in Figure 2 above. In addition the efficient use of technologies such as gas fuelled CHP can still achieve substantial carbon emissions savings compared to conventional heat sources.The use of electricity alone in the provision of space heating could also lead to an increase in the levels of fuel poverty due to the high and increasing cost of electricity.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Low carbon heat generation systems such as district heating which are largely fuelled by gas can therefore play an increasingly significant role in helping stabilise and reduce demand on the electricity grid. As heat networks can be powered by a wide range of fuels such as biomass and deep geothermal (in some cases) this makes them an even more attractive option for supplying space heating relative to centralised electricity and heat pumps which place a massive demand on the electricity grid. More importantly, due to their fuel agnostic nature heat networks and similar schemes started with gas fired CHP as the principal fuel source can be continually decarbonised through the  greater use of renewable heating technologies as they expand and grow.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Low Carbon Infrastructure Accelerator Fund&#xa0;A Policy Proposal for:The Department of Energy and Climate Change&#xa0;&#xa0;July 2011&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Executive Summary]]]The UK Government has demonstrated a desire for increased deployment of district energy, which is proven to be an effective way to provide wide areas and diverse customer bases with low carbon energy supplies.  The UK’s current exploitation of district energy is very low compared to our continental neighbours.  However many of the UK’s district energy schemes which are already in operation have clearly demonstrated the substantial benefits that stand to be realise, from reduction of fuel poverty through to greenhouse gas emission savings far in excess of those which can be achieved with the efforts of individual consumers.District energy networks typically require a small number of core loads to get started and then expand in a relatively organic process, picking up consumers within near reach.  In this way, it can take many years for even a modest number of new consumers to connect to any given district energy scheme.  Servicing wider areas with district energy networks before potential consumers are contracted to connect is simply not possible, due to the small operational margins of the Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) which operate district energy schemes.The proposed Low Carbon Infrastructure Accelerator Fund (LCIAF) would operate as a loan fund, enabling pre-servicing of high heat density areas with district energy infrastructure.  This would enable new consumers to be added to district energy networks at a substantially increased rate, helping to decarbonise whole areas of towns and cities.  Repayments towards the loan would be made whenever new consumers connect to the pre-serviced sections of network.  This form of fund is potentially more sustainable than grant funding, as re-payments are re-cycled back into the fund to help incentivise further district energy network installation, maximising the benefits achieved for the given expenditure.In addition to accelerating the deployment of low carbon energy across the UK, the LCIAF would bring in increased investment from ESCOs, not just towards district energy infrastructure but also for the low carbon energy plant needed to provide these new consumers with energy.Sections 1 to 3 of this paper provide more detailed background to the current situation and Section 4 proposes a method for the LCIAF to rapidly increase the deployment of low carbon district energy projects throughout the UK.&#xa0;

[[[The UK’s District Energy Industry]]]The UK Government’s intentions for increased deployment of District Energy seem clear.  In a recent speech to the Royal Geographical Society, Chris Huhne called for “more district heating schemes” to help reduce wasted energy.  Greg Barker suggested in a speech to the European Energy Forum in October, that the Green Investment Bank could be used to invest in district heating.  DECC’s own Community Energy Online Portal contains links to a significant volume of information on District Heating.  However, all of this positivity has to be seen in the context of a significantly under-developed district energy sector in the UK.

[[[Current Take-up of District Heating in the United Kingdom]]]Pöyry’s Report to the Department of Energy and Climate Change in April 2009 estimated that district heating “currently provides less than 2% of UK heat demand”.  In contrast, use of district heating in continental Europe is far more widespread; the same report identifies that Austria, Finland and Denmark benefit from 18%, 49% and 60% of their total heat supplies, respectively, coming from district heating.

[[[UK District Energy Association Schemes]]]Members of the UK District Energy Association have already proved that district energy can play a successful role in mitigating the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions.  District energy schemes operated by UKDEA members deliver over 500 million kWh of heat every year, saving approximately 100,000 tonnes of carbon emissions per annum when compared to conventional alternative forms of heat supply.Beyond the significant carbon emission savings achieved by UKDEA members’ schemes, fuel poverty and constraints on business competitiveness are tackled too.  For example: 

[[[The UK’s Potential]]]The figures clearly demonstrate that the UK’s district energy potential is not yet being fulfilled.  UK heat sales (including industrial heat use) total 15.7 million MWh.  In Germany, sales of heat just from district heating schemes (i.e. not including industrial heat use) are approximately 74.2 million MWh; over four and a half times the UK’s total heat sales.Pöyry’s report demonstrated that the carbon savings achieved by district heating are, on average, much greater than achieved by stand-alone renewable technologies.  With heat responsible for almost half of the UK’s carbon emissions, there is no doubt that an increase in delivery of district energy would result in substantial reductions in the UK’s carbon emissions.  As stated on the “distributed energy and heat” section of DECC’s website, “a radical shift is needed in how electricity and heat is generated, delivered and used in homes and businesses”.

[[[Previous Support for District Energy]]]A number of funding schemes have previously been available in the UK to support the development of district energy.  However, whilst the first two funding schemes detailed below have resulted in the development and expansion of district energy in the UK, none of these funding mechanisms are available today.

[[[Community Energy ]]]

[[[Programme]]]Historically, this support and grant funding programme has been the most significant funding stream for supporting district energy projects.  The Community Energy Programme (CEP) provided grant capital for installing district heating networks.  This scheme was withdrawn in 2006.

[[[Low Carbon Infrastructure Fund]]]This initiative was delivered by a partnership of DECC, the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) and the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA).  This grant funding stream for low carbon community heating schemes is now finished, with all funding committed and no further funding available at present.

[[[Regional Infrastructure Funding]]]Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) offered this as a potential funding model, whereby European funds were used as loan funding to extend the reach of district energy networks, allowing speculative development of energy networks which could attract consumers at greater rates than the typical “organic growth” model of district heating.  Repayments of the loan funding were expected to be made each time a new consumer connected to the district energy network.  A UKDEA member explored this potential in considerable detail prior to the recent changes to the Regional Development Agencies.

[[[Limitations of the Current Support Regime]]]Despite DECC’s recognition of the need for a “radical shift” in how energy is delivered, support for district energy is now piecemeal and often short-term.  Mechanisms such as Enhanced Capital Allowances, CCL Exemption, Renewable Obligation Certificates and the Renewable Heat Incentive, all help to incentivise various forms of low carbon technology.  However, none of these mechanisms incentivise the district energy networks that could accelerate the deployment of low carbon energy to multiple consumers on an effective, decentralised basis, rather than relying on piecemeal action by individual consumers.District energy schemes expand through a relatively organic process, connecting new developments (and existing buildings at the end of plant-replacement cycles) that are within reach of the existing network.  Costs of new connections can be high, primarily because of the expensive civil works and specialist pipe materials involved.  These connections are typically funded by a “capital connection charge”, intended to be no more expensive than the alternative costs of a conventional energy plant solution, so as to incentivise connection.  Operators of district energy schemes are unable to fund speculative pre-servicing of areas themselves, because operational margins are simply not sufficient.  If wider delivery of district energy is to be achieved, a means must be established to accelerate the reach of existing schemes and further incentivise the commissioning of new ‘core schemes’ with the possibility of rapid expansion to new consumers.DECC have clearly placed significant emphasis on the drive for community energy.  Without adequate financial support however, community action will be stifled and opportunities will be missed.  The long term nature of energy supply and plant replacement cycles means that once a chance of connection to a low carbon energy supply is missed, the opportunity can be wasted for decades to come.  Relying on sporadic grant funding schemes results in ‘feast and famine’ delivery, rather than the necessary sustainable growth of district energy networks which can capture opportunities as they arise.&#xa0;

[[[The Low Carbon Infrastructure Accelerator Fund]]]This proposed ‘Low Carbon Infrastructure Accelerator Fund’ is based in part around the ‘Regional Infrastructure Fund’ mechanism once put forward by Regional Development Agencies.Awards from the proposed loan fund would enable district energy schemes to pre-service areas of high heat density.  Pre-agreed re-payments of the loan are made when new energy consumers connect to these district energy networks, and the re-payments are funded by those consumers’ connection charges.  More effective than grants, this funding mechanism can be more self-sustaining, recycling the revenues to new schemes and maximising the delivery of low-carbon energy schemes nationwide. This method of funding would also bring increased investment from ESCOs into both district energy networks and also the low carbon plant required to provide the substantially increased customer base with energy.  As an example of where increased private sector funding would be brought in by the LCIAF, an ESCO would be able to fund and develop an energy centre on the basis of revenues received from a consumer connecting to the far end of an LCIAF pre-funded network; such a building would not have been able to take part in a district energy scheme in the absence of the LCIAF funded network and the district energy scheme would have been smaller or even unviable as a result.  Figure 1 below illustrates this effect; for this hypothetical development area, the solid red line represents the district energy network that would normally be economically feasible, only supplying the nearest section of development.  The development zone to the right of the figure is therefore unable to benefit from low carbon and low cost energy supplies from the district energy scheme and the scheme may be less efficient with the smaller total energy loads.  The dotted red line illustrates a section of LCIAF funded network, picking up all initial phases of development as well as pre-servicing an area for later development phases, thereby maximising take-up of the low carbon district energy solution and allowing an ESCO to invest in developing the most effective solution for these larger energy loads.Figure 1 - Example of LCIAF extending the reach and effectiveness of a district energy solutionA number of case studies exist which demonstrate both the success of similar funding mechanisms and where substantial opportunities for development of low carbon energy have been missed, due to lack of available support.  The UKDEA is able to work with DECC in developing policy on a robust evidence-base.It’s important to note that additional benefits arise from the future-proofing nature of district energy networks; district energy solutions allow even lower-carbon forms of energy generation to be installed in later years, as they become viable, continuing to decarbonise every customer in the years to come without the need for substantial further effort and investment by those consumers.

[[[Proposed Mechanism]]]A more detailed overview of the proposed mechanism is set out below:

[[[Recycling of Funding]]]Repayments into the fund from consumer connection charges can be recycled out to further low carbon infrastructure projects, making the LCIAF an ‘ever-greening’ and more sustainable form of support.  A target long-stop date for the LCIAF could allow further returns to the fund to be put towards other areas, once delivery of low carbon infrastructure has been sufficiently accelerated.&#xa0;Figure 2 – Example Early Years Delivery of LCIAFFigure 3 - Illustration of the Low Carbon Infrastructure Fund Mechanism

[[[Sources of Funding &amp; Projected Benefits]]]As set out in Figure 3, there are a number of potential sources of funding to support the LCIAF, including the ERDF, General Taxation, JESSCIA funding and payments made as part of zero carbon ‘allowable solutions’.The Scottish Government have recently announced a district heating loan fund which should not only incentivise action nationwide but could also provide a useful foundation from which policy makers can proceed and lessons can be learnt.Based on previous levels of funding for district energy, the UKDEA estimate that £50 million pounds is an adequate fund size to incentivise very significant delivery and expansion of district energy, across more than fifty separate areas.  This fund could be fully recovered over the long-term, and has the potential to offset in excess of 6 million tonnes of CO2 emissions over the new district energy infrastructure’s lifetime.  Members of the UKDEA are willing to undertake detailed analysis and provide supporting evidence to DECC, should this proposal be of interest, to enable a realistic evidence-base to form the basis of policy.  &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Addendum 1 – Projected Employment Figures]]]&#xa0;

[[[Executive Summary]]]The Government has made clear that it plans to increase deployment of district energy in the UK.  This laudable and necessary aspiration needs to be seen in the context of a significantly under-developed district energy sector, compared to its technical potential and the development of district energy in other European Countries where specific support mechanisms have been utilised to encourage growth/support networks.One of the central aims of the UK District Energy Association is to engage with Government and share the experience of its members, to accelerate the deployment of low-carbon district energy across the UK.The UKDEA is not a trade organisation but instead counts as its Full Members, bodies that are responsible for developing and operating most of the successful district energy schemes in the UK.  Our members include not just private sector energy service companies (ESCOs) but also the public sector authorities who are centrally involved in the development of district energy schemes.Current take up of district energy in the UK is estimated to be less than 2% of heat demand.  In advance of the published results of DECC’s district heating survey, we have undertaken analysis which demonstrates that it should be feasible to supply over 100 TWh of heat (14% of the UK’s heating and hot water demands) through low-carbon district heating networks.Assuming total decarbonisation of these networks in the run-up to 2050, the greenhouse gas emissions savings should exceed over 36 MtCO2e – a 26% reduction in the current greenhouse gas emissions relating to heating and hot water.The current energy and legislative landscape contains a number of barriers which prevent deployment of district energy, including shortfalls in potential support mechanisms.  District energy often provides the most cost effective means of decarbonising energy supplies on a whole-life cost basis but does suffer from high capital costs.  We have included a basic summary table in this paper of typical district heating costs.  Additionally, we are happy to work with DECC to help develop a more detailed evidence base.In Section 3, we have proposed a number of distinct policy measures to accelerate the delivery of low-carbon district energy schemes to achieve the realistic but challenging target of delivering within the next 20 years 14% of all heat in the UK from low carbon district energy schemes.  These are summarised below:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A low carbon heat network incentive of 0.75p/kWh – providing a long-term revenue stream for low carbon heat sales through district energy networks, just as with the RHI.&#xa0;Lastly, we have provided two worked examples in Section 4, based on feasibility studies for actual district energy schemes, and how the measures proposed could help to remove the barriers to their delivery.  The case studies demonstrate that these specific policy measures will unlock the potential for the rapid expansion of district energy in the UK, as set out in this paper.&#xa0;

[[[The UK’s District Energy Industry]]]The UK Government has clear declared intentions for increased deployment of District Energy.  However, this positivity has to be seen in the context of a significantly under-developed district energy sector in the UK.

[[[Current Take-up of District Heating in the United Kingdom]]]Pöyry’s Report to the Department of Energy and Climate Change in April 2009 estimated that district heating “currently provides less than 2% of UK heat demand”.  In contrast, use of district heating in continental Europe is far more widespread; the same report identifies that Austria, Finland and Denmark benefit from 18%, 49% and 60% of their total heat supplies, respectively, coming from district heating.  DECC is now putting substantial effort into understanding the true extent of the UK’s existing district energy schemes, engaging BRE and Databuild to undertake a detailed, nationwide assessment of district energy.  The results of this survey will be a national database which can form a detailed evidence base around which to form future policy. The UKDEA and its members have been playing an active role in the development of this national assessment which it had identified was an essential requirement to build the “knowledge base for district energy in the UK”, from which the desired growth can be planned.

[[[UK Dis]]]

[[[trict Energy Association]]]

[[[ Schemes]]]Members of the UK District Energy Association have already proved that district energy can play a successful role in mitigating the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions.  District energy schemes operated by UKDEA members deliver over 600 million kWh of heat every year, saving approximately 100,000 tonnes of carbon emissions per annum when compared to conventional alternative forms of heat supply.Figure 4 - Breakdown of the low carbon heat sources for UKDEA schemesBeyond the significant carbon emission savings achieved by UKDEA members’ schemes, fuel poverty and constraints on business competitiveness are tackled too.  For example: 

[[[The UK’s Potential]]]Whilst successful schemes exist in the UK, the figures clearly demonstrate that the UK’s vast district energy potential is not yet being fulfilled.  UK heat sales (including industrial heat use) total 15.7 million MWh.  By comparison, in Germany, sales of heat just from district heating schemes (i.e. not including industrial heat use) are approximately 74.2 million MWh; over four and a half times the UK’s total heat sales.Pöyry’s report demonstrated that the carbon savings achieved by district heating are, on average, much greater than achieved by stand-alone renewable technologies.  With heat responsible for approximately half of the UK’s total carbon emissions, there is no doubt that an increase in delivery of district energy schemes would result in substantial reductions in the UK’s carbon emissions.  As stated on the “distributed energy and heat” section of DECC’s website, “a radical shift is needed in how electricity and heat is generated, delivered and used in homes and businesses”.It is essential to quantify the opportunities for development of district energy, prior to and notwithstanding the completion of Databuild and BRE’s detailed UK district energy survey of existing schemes.  We have therefore undertaken some detailed analysis of the potential for new district energy schemes across the UK based on our members extensive knowledge of what can realistically be delivered in any urban area.

[[[The Analysis]]]District energy schemes are most effective (in terms of cost-effectiveness, energy efficiency and carbon savings) in highly heat dense areas, where substantial heat demands can be met with a minimum of installed network.The analysis did not seek to provide a comprehensive look at the total potential for district energy but instead concentrated on the largest 200 (by population) UK towns &amp; cities.  Many of these cities already have some form of district energy networks in place, from small networks based around individual developments or housing estates to large city scale schemes.  We have included details of existing UKDEA member schemes in the analysis, where possible, to base our calculations on a practical real world evidence base.  The analysis therefore gives an indication of the increase in heat supplied through large scale urban district energy, which could be achieved over the coming years in the appropriate legislative landscape.Notwithstanding the importance of this potential, there is additionally substantial potential to decarbonise the nation’s heat supplies through many smaller scale communal and district heating schemes based around smaller clusters of heat dense consumers, such as new mixed use developments and rural estates.The time required to deliver the projected schemes will vary substantially from case to case.  Many Local Authorities have already investigated the potential for district energy within their boundaries but are unsure how to proceed with delivery.  Many potential schemes face specific barriers to their delivery and many Local Authorities will not currently hold any assessments of the potential for district energy within their boundaries.  Realising the potential will be heavily reliant on an improved legislative landscape for district energy, without which the necessary scale of deployment cannot be realised.All settlements where schemes were not already in place were assumed to start with a core scheme selling circa 10,000 MWh heat per annum.  This figure was estimated as an average of core scheme sizes in a set of recent feasibility studies undertaken by one UKDEA member.  The schemes can then grow by connecting new consumers.  The rate at which this growth occurs, and the size that is reached by each district energy scheme, depends on the size of each settlement.  Being one of the most easily accessible data sets, this analysis was based on the populations of the towns and cities in question.  It was assumed that district energy schemes initially follow a similar level of delivered heat per population as current good practice UK district heating schemes operated by UKDEA members. Furthermore, towards 2030, it’s assumed that district energy schemes should grow in scale to match well developed European schemes on a kWh/population basis, such as the district heating scheme in Vienna, Austria.Assuming current barriers to district energy can be effectively reduced, disincentives removed and appropriate incentives put in place (as set out in this paper), the initial installation of core district energy schemes, for every one of the 200 towns and cities analysed, could take between 2 years and 5 years.  Once this has been achieved, substantial growth can take place, with significant increases in connected consumers over the following decades.The detailed analysis can be viewed in Appendix 1 to this paper.  The results are certainly not an upper limit on the potential for district energy in the UK as they concentrate on larger scale schemes and may well underestimate the potentially important role of smaller scale district energy.By 2030, it could be possible to supply over 100 TWh p.a. of heat through district energy networks, which is over 14% of the UK’s current heating and hot water demands.  Assuming these district energy schemes provide heat with similar carbon savings (when compared to heat from a mixture of boiler plant and grid electricity) to existing good practice energy from waste and CHP based systems, the greenhouse gas emissions averted would be in excess of 28 MtCO2e.  If all these district energy systems then fully decarbonise, the averted annual GHG emissions top 36 MtCO2e – 26% of the nation’s current greenhouse gas emissions related to supply of heating and hot water.Figure 5 - Potential Growth of Low Carbon District Energy in the UK.

[[[Making it Happen]]]Despite DECC’s recognition of the need for a “radical shift” in how energy is delivered, support for district energy is now piecemeal and often short-term.  Mechanisms such as Enhanced Capital Allowances, CCL Exemption, Renewable Obligation Certificates and the Renewable Heat Incentive, all help to incentivise various forms of low carbon technology.  However, none of these mechanisms have been implemented with regard to the district energy networks that could accelerate the deployment of low carbon energy to multiple consumers on an effective, decentralised basis, rather than relying on piecemeal action by individual consumers.Costs of installing district energy network can be high, primarily because of the expensive civil works and specialist pipe materials involved.  We have set out below some current typical network installation costs, to help improve DECC’s current evidence base.All costs averaged to give typical figures per metre trench length.Materials CostsCity Centre Installation CostsTotal Network Costs(pre-insulated pipework, including pre-formed fittings)(civil &amp; mechanical works)Small scale, single consumer connection£55 - £105£850 - £1,250£905 - £1,355Large scale connection£150 - £300£1,200 - £1,500£1,350 - £1,800Large distribution network spine£100 - £220£1,120 - £1,350£1,220 - £1,570Table 1 - Typical capital costs, including fittings.  Note that shorter network lengths can result in higher average costs per metre.The UKDEA has set out below three high-priority actions to improve the landscape for low-carbon district energy in the short term.  In addition to the items below, we will continue to engage with all levels of Government, to ensure that the potential for low carbon district energy in the UK is realised.

[[[Renewable Heat Incentive &amp; District Heat Incentive]]]Use of renewable heating plant in conjunction with district energy results in useful economies of scale when compared to installation of smaller renewable heat generators installed in individual consumer buildings.  For example, the increased base-load which results when gathering diverse load profiles onto a single heat network, results in greater operational efficiencies and an increased proportion of heat use from the low carbon energy plant (such as biomass boilers).  Because heat networks allow utilisation of a single, larger scale renewable plant (in place of several smaller individual renewable plants) the same amount of renewable heat energy supply can be made with a smaller RHI tariff band, incurring significantly less expense to the RHI.  However, the heat networks themselves can be very expensive to install, increasing the capital costs substantially.  The RHI does not take this extra cost of heat networks into account, leaving district heating significantly under-incentivised.  In fact, because any heat losses between buildings are not counted as “eligible heat”, there is an effective tariff reduction (pro-rata) for any renewable heat plant connected to district energy networks, despite the efficiency benefits already noted above.  This means that it is harder to recover the investment made on a central renewable plant, than if it had been installed at a single large consumer building.Two actions are required to remove this disincentive for district heating:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A low carbon heat network incentive of 0.75p/kWh – providing a long-term revenue stream for low carbon heat sales through district energy networks, just as with the RHI.&#xa0;The UKDEA recognises the need to avoid incentivising excessive heat losses under the RHI.  However, the sheer cost of installing district energy network means that there is no perverse incentive to install unnecessary network.  It therefore only remains to ensure that poor practice is not incentivised; this is why we have suggested a maximum heat loss threshold, beyond which heat losses should be taken into account and RHI revenue reduced accordingly.  It may be preferable to consider an alternative threshold, such as minimum U-value, and the UKDEA is keen to explore with DECC what is appropriate.Rather than incentivising district energy network installation through the RHI, as was originally envisaged, we suggest that our proposed incentive mechanism would be separate to the RHI, incentivising all forms of heat network which provide low carbon heat, whether from renewable sources, good quality CHP or energy from waste.The suggested incentive of 0.75p/kWh is based on high level modelling.  Typical capital shortfalls will vary from project to project, depending on a number of factors, such as length of district energy network required and nature of the connected consumers.  It may therefore be appropriate to provide a banded incentive, depending on the nature of the project.  For instance, installation of district heating network is relatively easy for new build developments as it can be installed at the same time as other services; conversely, retrofit projects can often require installation of substantial internal communal pipework and related remedial works, increasing the costs substantially.The UKDEA is keen to work with DECC in developing these proposals further, providing evidence and undertaking modelling to understand in the projected costs and benefits in more detail.

[[[Energy Company Obligation]]]Whilst the CERT scheme did not typically provide sufficient incentive to install district energy networks, the Community Energy Savings Programme (CESP) was responsible for catalysing a number of new district energy schemes.  The timescales which had to be met under CESP were relatively challenging for district energy projects, because of their inherent complexities, but it is fair to say that district energy involvement in CESP was a tentative success.For example, CESP funding is being utilised to install district energy systems in Leicester at the St Peters, St Marks and St Matthews estates.  The CESP funding here provided important additionality and has leveraged further private investment many times that provided by the Obligated Generator.  Over 2,350 dwellings were included within the district heating measures, which are projected to save lifetime emissions of over 66,700 tonnes CO2.  Such emissions savings eclipse those which could be achieved on a piecemeal basis with individual action at each of the premises.Therefore, it is wholly appropriate that the forthcoming Energy Company Obligation (ECO) replacing CESP should build on the lessons learned and move a step further in incentivising district energy networks.  Unfortunately, the ECO currently seems intrinsically limited to a single property approach and will miss out on the substantial economies of scale achievable if a “whole area” approach is appropriately incentivised.We therefore suggest the following actions:

[[[Heat Regulation]]]A considerable barrier to greater and faster deployment of district energy networks is industry inertia, where consumers and their energy consultants are wedded to “standard solutions” and frequently not even aware of the potential to develop or connect to low carbon heat networks.Full regulation of the heat market in the UK, along the same lines as current gas or electricity regulation, would irreparably damage such a nascent industry.  However, there is currently potential to develop appropriate guidance and standards beyond that which is currently available, including standard forms of agreement and consumer protection.  Therefore:The UKDEA will be producing the definitive guide to the development of district energy schemes in Summer 2012 and from this springboard we plan to develop a suit of documents which will then form the basis for standardising the delivery of district energy in the UK. We would like to discuss with DECC how we can collaboratively issue these.

[[[Case-Studies]]]

[[[Overview]]]It is critically important to understand that whilst it is possible to undertake generic analysis of district energy in the UK, each scheme has different dynamics due to the specifics of the building’s/development’s combinations and arrangements in that urban area. This means that it is essential to analyse actual real world case studies of what is preventing district energy development and just what is required to make this happen.  Two example case studies are set out below.

[[[Case Study 1 – A Midlands Council]]]A feasibility study looking into district energy opportunities was commissioned by a Midlands Council, in April 2010.  The study identified a number of options for delivering a core district heating scheme, with the potential to grow substantially with further heating connections over time.The study identified an indicative capital cost of circa £1,625,000 (for the most basic option centred around council buildings, the police station and two private consumers, as anchor loads).  This capital cost can be met primarily through a combination of:&#xa0;In the case of this local authority (“LA”), these two sources of capital were insufficient to meet the total capital cost.  For the project to go ahead, a shortfall of £212,600 needed to be met through either grant funding or a financial contribution from the LA.In the absence of any external funding stream, the LA are left with a decision whether or not to provide public money, without which the district energy scheme will not be able to go ahead.  Whilst there would be undoubted long-term benefits to the area from a new district energy system, these can be difficult to quantify; the primary driver for this LA’s decision is therefore the operational cost savings achieved by connecting to the scheme.  Energy costs were calculated to provide a 5% operational cost saving when compared to the all-in costs of energy from conventional sources.  These cost savings totalled approximately £20,000 per annum.If the LA were to provide the gap funding therefore, the simple payback would be longer than 10 years.  Once the procurement costs are factored in – sometimes estimated to reach over £200,000 – it can be seen that the cost savings are not sufficient to incentivise progress on their own.Suggested Measure 5 will help to reduce the administrative burdens and costs of procurement:To meet the capital shortfall and enable immediate development of this low carbon district energy solution, suggested Measure 2 can meet the shortfall, with no upfront capital grant required:A district heating network incentive of just 0.75p/kWh would provide the scheme with further revenue of circa £36,000 per annum.  This would effectively enable either:&#xa0;

[[[Case Study 2 – A ]]]

[[[Major South Coast City Centre]]]A feasibility study into district energy opportunities in this City identified significant opportunity for a scheme with a range of different heat consumers.  Potential connections include a high-rise housing block that is currently heated by old and carbon intensive electric storage heaters, which are deemed by both residents and the housing association as being inadequate.These dwellings could be retrofitted with wet heating systems and connection to a city centre district energy scheme, substantially decarbonising the supplies of heat for these hard-to-treat properties.  Greenhouse gas emissions savings from connection to a local district energy scheme are estimated to be 9.8 tonnesCO2 per annum, per dwelling; circa 1,072 tonnesCO2 per annum in total.However, the internal retrofit and district energy connection would be expensive, requiring some form of outside funding to meet a capital over-cost of approximately £300,000.Suggested Measures 3 and 4 would offer an opportunity to incentivise this retrofit project with zero cost to central Government:Following a similar methodology to the existing CESP scheme, a cost per lifetime emissions saving of funding could be applied, through the forthcoming Energy Company Obligation.  Low carbon district energy schemes vary in their costs and carbon savings from case to case.  In the case of this building, assuming a 30 year “lifetime” is applied to the measure, a funding price of £9.50 per lifetime abated tonnes CO2 is sufficient to meet the over-cost and enable future proofed supplies of low carbon heat to a hard-to-treat building.  This compares favourably with the emissions abatement costs typically seen under CESP and shows that if it is appropriately set up, the ECO could effectively incentivise the connection of large numbers of hard to treat properties to low carbon district energy supplies.

[[[Addendum 1 – Projected Employment Figures]]]&#xa0;Following the initial analysis for this policy paper, further calculations have been carried out to estimate the likely employment opportunities and operational cost benefits for energy consumers, created by the projected rise in low carbon district energy schemes. Based on knowledge of existing district energy schemes, one permanent job role is expected to be created for every 10 GWh of annual thermal energy sales (a measure of the scale of district energy schemes).  For example, a scheme which generates and provides 50 GWh of heat might be expected to employ 5 permanent staff.In addition to permanent job roles, further employment opportunities are supported in the industries which manufacture and install the requisite district energy pipework and plant.  These jobs are not related to the installed capacity of district energy but instead are related to the rate at which district energy is being installed.  The assumed rate of employment for these roles was taken to be 35 job roles for every 50 GWh of scheme capacity installed in a given year.The two job creation projections are shown in the chart below:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Figure 6 - Projected Job Creation from Accelerated Delivery of District Energy

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Addendum 2 – Cost Savings]]]&#xa0;Operational cost savings are a typical benefit for district energy consumers, when compared to conventional sources of energy.  These cost savings vary from scheme to scheme but energy supplies are often benchmarked to show savings in the region of 5%-10%, when compared to the all-in costs of operation and maintenance of typical boiler plant.  As an example of the scale of these cost savings, the total savings for all consumers connected to the Southampton District energy Scheme are estimated to be approximately £500,000 per annum.The consumer cost savings already achieved at a number of UKDEA members’ schemes have been used as a benchmark, to provide projected cost savings to consumers of future district energy schemes.  In line with this paper’s projections for future delivery of district energy, the annual operational cost savings are shown in the chart below, with an estimate of the public sectors savings also shown separately on the same chart.Figure 7 - Projected Annual Operational Cost Savings for District Energy Consumers&#xa0;
