"&#xa0;\nThe Rt Hon Kenneth Clarke QC MP – Written evidence&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe purpose of this letter is to outline the reasons for the new order-making power that would enable a Minister of the Crown to disapply, by an order made by statutory instrument, and subject to the will of Parliament, legislation (either primary or secon\ndary) which the Minister considers to be no longer of practical use.  \n&#xa0;\nI would like to address some of the concerns raised by the Law Commission. \n&#xa0;\nReasons for the new order-making power:&#xa0;\nThe Government shares the objectives of the Law Commission to make\n the law more accessible and to remove obsolete legislation from the statute book. The Government believes that the new power would add to our overall ability to achieve that and poses no threat to the responsibilities and work of the Law Commission. \n&#xa0;\nThe\n order-making power would be supplementary, not duplicatory, to the work being carried out by the Law Commission’s Statute Law Repeals (SLR) work. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe order-making power would also be supplementary, not duplicatory, to Part 1 of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006.  The existing provisions within the 2006 Act were not drafted to deal with legislation that is no longer of practical use, and\n in many cases it would be difficult to show that disapplying this type of legislation removes a live ‘burden’ within the meaning of that Act.  \n&#xa0;\nSafeguards:&#xa0;\nClauses 54 to 56 provide the proposed Parliamentary safeguards for the use of this power.  The pr\nocedure chosen for making an order is essentially the same as that set out in section 16 of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006.  We have deliberately avoided creating a new form of Parliamentary procedure, consistent with the recommendation of \nthe Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee in its 3rd Report of the 2012-2013 session (Special Report: Strengthened Statutory Procedures for the Scrutiny of Delegated Powers).  Like the LRO procedure, it differs in important respects from the usu\nal form of negative procedure and these differences supply the key safeguards: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAs a whole these safeguards are \nstronger\n than those for the affirmative procedure.\n&#xa0;\nConcerns raised by Law Commission:&#xa0;\nThe Law Commission provided you with written evidence and subsequent oral evidence on 16 \nOctober.   The main concerns expressed by the Commission were:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Government noted that during the evidence session the Right Honourable Lord Justice Lloyd Jones explained to the Committee that when it came to the Law Commission’s law reform work, the measures coming out of the Red Tape Challen\nge would not be “the sort of area that [the Commission] would enter or which expert legal views would necessarily be of assistance. It seems ... to be more political.”  The Government agrees with this point as most of the Bill (aside from Schedule 16) deal\ns with matters which could not be dealt with as part of either the Commission’s SLR work or its other law reform work.\n&#xa0;\nGovernment response to these concerns:&#xa0;\nConcern over unnecessary duplication of procedures\n&#xa0;\nThe above point raised by the Right \nHonourable Lord Justice Lloyd Jones is also important in terms of   the Law Commission being an independent body that is apolitical.  The Commission must be very cautious about which measures it allows into its Bills (including SLR Bills) if it is to maint\nain the confidence of Parliament and to be allowed to use truncated Parliamentary process.  Ministers, however, may reasonably take a different view about whether a measure is no longer of practical use.  It would be right under those circumstances for the\n Minster to make the case for repeal under the new process.\n&#xa0;\nThe Government does not see either Schedule 16 or the proposed new order-making procedure in the Deregulation Bill as duplicating the Law Commission’s SLR work.  It would only be duplication if b\noth the Government and the Commission were trying to disapply the exact same law.  The Commission focus on specific areas of the law, for instance their website says that projects to be researched for their next Statute Law Repeals Report (due for publicat\nion in 2016) are likely to include laws on overseas territories and churches.  Schedule 16 and the new order-making power provide departments with the scope to focus on areas of law which for the time being are not being considered by the Law Commission.\n&#xa0;\nConcern over the need for rigorous analysis, research and consultation\n&#xa0;\nIn the course of their work, departments regularly repeal legislation and know the importance of accuracy and the need to consider saving, transitional or consequential provisions (whi\nch would be made through clause 57).  Departmental lawyers would also be able to consult the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel at any time on difficult drafting points, and any draft order which amends primary legislation would be subject to scrutiny by \nParliamentary Counsel before being laid.  All draft orders would also be subject to internal clearances.\n&#xa0;\nThe Deregulation Bill itself demonstrates the care which departments take in this matter. For example, Part 1 of Schedule 5 to the Bill repeals the De\neds of Arrangement Act 1914 as part of a package of insolvency measures. The department’s research indicated that there was still one person who had a deed of arrangement under the Act. Consideration was given to how to deal with this and it was decided to\n include a special saving provision in paragraph 3 of Schedule 5 (rather than put this in Schedule 16 – since it was not clearly ‘of no practical effect’).\n&#xa0;\nConcern over the need for detailed consultation\n&#xa0;\nThe Government fully accepts that there should be \nappropriate consultation and clause 54 reflects this. There will be cases where it is clear that a piece of legislation is no longer of practical use (for example, where the legislation has expired or where it is otherwise spent as a matter of law) and the\nrefore a more light touch level of consultation can be undertaken than is argued for by the Law Commission.  It would fall to the Minister to explain the nature of the consultation to the relevant committee as part of the order-making process.\n&#xa0;\nConcern ove\nr being made a statutory consultee\n&#xa0;\nThe consultation requirement in clause 54(1)(a) was included because of the Law Commission’s existing role. Its principal purpose was to ensure that the Law Commission would be aware of what the government proposed to do\n under the power. It might, for example, become clear that a particular proposal was already included in a current Law Commission SLR programme of work. Consultation reduces the potential for overlap. The requirement was not intended to have the effect of \ndisrupting and delaying the Commission’s planned work or obliging them to do research.  Responsibility for the contents of orders under clause 51 would be that of the departments involved in their making.\n&#xa0;\nIf the Committee so recommend, we could amend the \ndraft Bill before introduction to omit any express mention of the Law Commissions.  In this case, the Commissions would simply fall under ‘other persons’ in clause 54 (1)(b).  The omission of any express reference of the Law Commissions would not therefore\n prevent the Commissions being approached for consultation if the Minister considers it is appropriate to do so.\n&#xa0;\nConcern over potential judicial review\n&#xa0;\nThe Government acknowledges that orders are potentially challengeable under judicial review.  However,\n this applies generally to all subordinate legislation.  There are now a number of powers to amend or repeal primary legislation by subordinate legislation (including the power to make a legislative reform order under section 1 of the Legislative and Regul\natory Reform Act 2006). The Government is not aware that this has given rise to legal uncertainty and the present proposal is less significant than the existing examples in that it only applies to obsolete law.  \n&#xa0;\nDepartmental officials and lawyers, and th\ne Office of the Parliamentary Council will be aware of the possibility of judicial review and take steps to minimise the risk of a successful challenge by ensuring that orders under clause 51 are within the powers conferred by the clause and that the corre\nct procedures are followed.\n&#xa0;\nMeasures contained in \nSchedule 16 to the Deregulation Bill:&#xa0;\nFinally, the Government notes the Joint Committee’s query as to why the measures contained in Schedule 16 to the Deregulation Bill were not put forward as candidates \nfor a Law Commission’s SLR Bill.  \n&#xa0;\nParticular reference was made to the Grey Squirrels (Prohibition of Importation and Keeping) Order 1937.  This would not have been suitable as an SLR candidate because it is not a straight revocation.  For this reason it\n is not in Schedule 16 (which makes provision for legislation which is no longer of practical use to cease to apply), but in paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 11 (other measures relating to animals, food and the environment).  Moreover, this amendment is one of s\neveral amendments to the Destructive Imported Animals Act 1932 and is more efficient to have them located in one place in the Bill and to be considered by Parliament together.\n&#xa0;\nGenerally, the principal reasons for the measures contained in Schedule 16 of \nthe draft Deregulation Bill not being nominated as SLR candidates are:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nI look forward to assisting the Committee with its scrutiny of the draft Deregulation Bill on 6 November when we give evidence a\nnd to receiving the Committee’s subsequent report in due course.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nKENNETH CLARKE\n&#xa0;\n05 November 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
