defaultThe Ramblers
default 
default(the Ramblers’ Association) 
defaultis a registered charity which seeks (among other things) to promote walking, both as a recreation and as the most sustainable form of transport. We also seek to promote the health, recreation and environmental benefits of walking, especially by protecting 
defaultand extending the network of public paths and access in town and countryside, through lobbying, campaigning and voluntary practical work, and, since April 2012, through our 
defaultpartnership with Macmillan Cancer Support, in which we run the Walking for Health p
defaultroject, delivering strategic guidance for the England-wide health walks programme and providing schemes with such support and free resources as training, insurance, and national promotion. (The local schemes are run by a variety of organisations including 
defaultcouncils, the NHS, charities and voluntary groups.)
default  
defaultIn addition to supporting Walking for Health walks, we organise 45,000 led walks per year. 12,000 volunteers lead the walks; about 300,000 people take part in them. We have been organising these led walk
defaults since our formation in 1935.

default              
defaultPedestrian safety is of paramount importance to the Ramblers, and we do not under-estimate the potential dangers posed by crossing a railway line on the level.  
defaultHowever, w
defaulte are of the view that a great deal could de done to improve the safety 
defaultof rights of way level crossings.  
defaultFor most public rights of way which cross a railway line on the level, the company’s (usually now Network Rail’s) obligations are set out i
defaultn section 61 of the Railway Clauses Consolidation Act 1845.   This reads:
default&#xa0;
default61.default              defaultCompany to make sufficient approaches and fences to bridleways and footways crossing on the level.default&#xa0;defaultIf the railway shall cross any highway other than a public carriageway on the
default level, the company shall at their own expense, make and at all times maintain convenient ascents and descents and other convenient approaches, with handrails or other fences, and shall, if such highway be a  bridleway, erect and at all times maintain good
default and sufficient  gates, and if the same shall be a footway, good or sufficient gates or stiles, on each side of the railway, where the railway shall communicate therewith.
default&#xa0;
default3.
default              
defaultSo, the railway company must make and maintain convenient approaches to the line
default and good and sufficient gates and stiles in the line side fences.
default  
defaultThe duties can be enforced by application to a magistrates’ court using the procedure set out in section 65 of the same Act. However, they apply only if the 1845 Act was itself applied by 
defaultthe statute authorising the construction of the line. In some such statutes alternative or additional duties may have been imposed on the company.
default&#xa0;
default4.
default              
defaultThe Ramblers is of the view that this aspect of level crossing legislation is in particular need of refor
defaultm and simplification so that the obligations to maintain safe crossings are absolute.  There are many practical problems on rights of way level crossings which need addressing—poor visibility because of overgrown vegetation, stiles and gates on the approac
defaulthes to lines not meeting the British Standard for Gaps, Gates and Stiles, poor surfaces at crossing points, etc.
default  
defaultIdeally there should be national standards for rights of way where they cross railway lines on the level.
default  
defaultIn 2010 
defaultDefra issued guidance on 
default“A
defaultuthorising structures (gaps, gates &amp; stiles) on rights of way
default—
defaultgood practice guidance for local authorities on compliance with the 
defaultEquality Act 2010”
default and this should be referenced in any new standard.  Such a standard should include a requirement that, on high speed lines (for example, the East and West Coast Main Lines), telephones be provided at non-gated and landowner operated gates so that the appr
defaultoach of trains and safe-crossing times can be ascertained.  Additionally, all crossings should have a reference prominently displayed so that in case of an accident or incident the emergency services and other appropriate persons can be notified of the exa
defaultct location.  It is our hope that many of these issues can be addressed by the implementation of the Law Commission’
defaults
default recommendations, for example, those in respect of level crossing plans.
default&#xa0;
default5.
default              
defaultThere should also be clear procedures to enable both railway s
defaulttaff and the public to report obstructions and damaged infrastructure on rights of way which cross railway lines, and the approaches to such crossings (the approach of both the right of way to the crossing point, as well as the approach of trains to that p
defaultoint).  The procedure should make clear the operating companies’ responsibility for rectifying problems, a timescale for doing so, and a clear response chain
default,
default i.e. a statement saying what work has been authorised, when the work is to be carried out, and no
defaulttification to the complainant when it has been completed.  If it is decided not to act on the report then reasons for that decision should be given.
default&#xa0;
default6.
default              
defaultAll signage used at footpath and bridleway level crossings should be reviewed to ensure that it can be 
defaultunderstood by all (i.e. by the use of pictograms).  Such signage should be included in the 
defaultHighway Code which does not, at present, offer instruction or information in respect of level crossings other than those which can be used by cars.
default  Signs needed for
default pedestrians include ‘obey flashing signals’ and  ‘do not cross when gates are shut’, ‘stop, look and listen’ and ‘phone to see if safe to cross’

defaultClosing public rights of way which cross railway lines
default&#xa0;
default7.
default              
defaultA major part of the work undertaken by 
defaultRamblers
default vo
defaultlunteers in England and Wales involves dealing with proposed changes to the rights of way network: diversion, extinguishment and, more rarely, creation orders made under the Highways Act and the Town and Country Planning Act, and orders made under the Tran
defaultsport and Works Act where the creation and extinguishment of rights of way is ancillary to the main purpose of the order (for example, the construction of a transport system).  Parliament has recognised the key role which the Ramblers and other path user g
defaultroups play in protecting the integrity of the rights of way network by prescribing us to be served notice of orders to alter the public rights of way network made under these provisions.
default&#xa0;
default8
default.
default              
defaultIn the context of 
defaultlevel crossing safety,
default it should be noted that 
defaultthe Ramblers was highly instrumental in the introduction of Rail Crossing extinguishment and 
defaultdiversion orders under 
default(new) 
defaultsections 118
defaultA
default and 119
defaultA
default of the Highways Act 1980.  In “Rights of Way: a guide to law and practice”
default, Riddall and Trevelyan explain what
default happened:
default&#xa0;
defaultIn November 1990 British Rail submitted to Parliament a Private Bill, the East Coast Main Line (Safety) Bill. If passed, this would have had the effect of closing ten level crossings over the East Coast Main Line, and thereby creating 20 
defaultcul-de-sac paths. Opposition from the R
defaultamblers’ Association
default and other bodies helped to persuade MPs to block its progress through Parliament.
defaultMeanwhile the government was preparing its Transport and Works Bill to provide new procedures for authorisation of
default many of the works construction powers hitherto granted through the Private Bill procedure. It was sufficiently persuaded of the need for special powers to close or divert public paths crossing railways on the level to include in the Bill amendments to the
default Highways Act 1980.
default&#xa0;
default8.
default              
defaultFrom the point of view of the Ramblers, other voluntary groups working for the protection of public rights of way, and ordinary members of the public, the introduction of these provisions was an important reform.  It meant that we d
defaultid not have to petition Parliament in respect of any Private Bills which sought to close or divert public rights of way which crossed railway lines.  However, as they stand, sections 118A and 119A are weaker in their protection of public rights than the st
defaultandard provisions for closure and diversion of public rights of way as set out in sections 118 and 119
default of the Highways Act 1980
default.  In respect of section 118A the weakness arises because there is no consideration of the use which the public are making of the
default route in question, either now or in the future.  In respect of section 119A, the tests of the suitability of the alternative rout
defaulte
default are weaker than under section 119—the point of termination of the alternative path does not have to be substantially as conv
defaultenient to the public and there are no tests 
defaultrequiring the new route to be not substantially less convenient to the public, or requiring consideration to be given to public enjoyment or to the effect that the new route will have on the interests of those wh
defaulto own or occupy the land it crosses.
default9.
default              
defaultBecause of this, we welcome the fact that the Law Commission
default is
default recommending a
default list of factors to be taken into account in considering an application for a level crossing closure order
default.  These are
default (as set out in the 
defaultrecently published report)
default:
default&#xa0;
defaultof accidents at the level crossing);
defaultinvolved in closing or closing and replacing the 
defaultcrossing;
defaultcrossings) on the efficiency of the rail and road networks;
defaultnetwork of non-vehicular public righ
defaultts of way;
defaultcommunity;
defaultcrossing users;
default&#xa0;default10.
default              
defaultS
defaultuch a list go
defaultes
default some 
defaultconsiderable 
defaultway towards meeting our concerns about sections 118A and 119A
default, outlined above, which as presently drawn up do not address the effect of the proposed change on users of the highway in question.  We particularly welcome the inclusion of 
defaultthe fourth 
defaultpoint
default, 
default“the effect (in the case of public level crossings) on the integ
defaultrity of the network of non-vehicular rights of way”
default,
default although 
defaultwe 
defaultquestion whether the words ‘non-vehicular’ are needed.  The public rights of way network also encompasses restricted byways and byways open to all traffic which are open to vehicles but which
default are used largely by people on foot, horseback and pedal cycle.  It is also the case that users on foot, horseback and pedal cycle make use of the vehicular highway network and any level crossings which it encompasses and that a minor diversion for users o
defaultf motor vehicles can be a very serious imposition on travel for non-motorised users.  Consideration of the effect of a level crossing closure or diversion must take into account the 
defaultlength and 
defaulttime needed to use any alternative route or routes.  In additio
defaultn to considering the integrity of the network, 
defaultwe consider that 
defaultthe list should also include reference to the safety of the alternative route: non-motorised users may be no better off if they are forced away from a level crossing and on to a narrow country
default road with no footway.
default&#xa0;
default11.
default              
defaultThe Ramblers, through its network of local volunteers, is always willing to meet Network Rail and relevant highway authorities to discuss changes to the rights of way network in the context of improving the safety of level 
defaultcrossings, new safety measures and alternative means of crossing such a bridges,

default.
default              
defaultIn recent years a problem has arisen, intimately linked to level crossing safety which 
defaulthas caused problems for rights of way users.  
defaultIn a number of locations around the country (we know of examples in Essex, Kent, Surrey and Greater Manchester), local residents living in the vicinity of railway lines 
defaulthad 
defaultcomplained 
defaultabout the loud noise made 
defaultby the horns which train-drivers 
defaultwere
default required to s
defaultound when their train approached
default a level crossing.  At such locations there is a track-side sign known as a whistle board which usually says ‘whistle’ or ‘sound horn’ or ‘S.W.’ (= ‘sound whistle’). 
default Howeve
defaultr, an
default ingenious application of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 
defaultby relevant highway authorities, working with 
defaultNetwork Rail, 
defaultled to the closure of the 
defaultpaths in question
default by means of a traffic regulation order. The scenario that gives rise to it seems to 
defaultbe entirely artificial: Network Rail, by arrangement with the highway authority, remove
defaults
default the whistle boards, thus making the crossings ‘dangerous’, since users no longer get an audible warning of a train’s approach. So 
defaultthe traffic regulation
default 
defaultorder were
default made on grounds of safety; probably as a preliminary measure t
defaulto
default seeking permanent closures or diversions under sections 118A and 119A of the Highways Act 1980.

default.
default              
defaultThe R
defaultamblers
default is of the view that this is a totally inappropriate view of the powers contain
defaulted in the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. 
defaultT
defaulthe highway authority has the duty of ensuring that all public rights of way are open and available for public use. Can it ever have been the case that Parliament intended TROs to be imposed where the ‘danger’ ha
defaults been deliberately and artificially created by means of an arrangement to which the highway authority is party?
default1
default4
default.
default              
defaultIt seems to us that 
defaultthis is an entirely wrong approach to the problem.  The answer must be to make the crossings safer by means of the meas
defaultures we describe in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 above 
defaultor 
defaultby making
default the horns quieter, or if there was no requirement for them to be used: a pedestrian who relied on them instead of looking to see if a train was coming would be cutting it pretty fine, given the s
defaultlow speed of sound compared with the speed of trains. 
defaultWe find it
default surprising that they still rely on this form of warning, when there could be a system of lights, bleepers and so on triggered in the same way that the automatic barriers on vehicular crossing
defaults operate.

defaultThe Ramblers participated fully in this project, attending meetings of the stakeholder advisory group, corresponding with the Commission
default’s
default officers, and submitting a 
defaultdetailed response to the 2010 consultation paper.  We consider the recommendations in the final report to be an important step forward in securing safer level crossings.
