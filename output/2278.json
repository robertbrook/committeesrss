"EIS 15\nWritten evidence submitted by Cleveland Potash LtdClevelan\nd Potash \nLtd \n(CPL) \nowns and operates a potash mine (Boulby Mine)\n on the north east coast of Yorkshire.  \nThe company\n nominally mine 3 mtpa potash ore (sylvite &amp; sylvinite) and refine this into 1mtpa potash (MOP = 95% KCl (60% K\n2\nO)) mainly used in the fertiliser industry. Although \nCPL\n produce enough potash to satisfy the\n UK demand, \nthe company \nonly suppl\nies\n about half this market with the remainder being imported from Germany, Russia and Canada.\n Consequently \nCPL\n export large tonnages of potash to \nsome European customers as well as competing for sales worldwide.\n  \nIn order\n to access the potash ore deposit, permanent roadways \nare mined \nin underlying salt (Halite (95% NaCl)) producing about 800 ktpa of co-product that is mostly sold to local authorities and highway authorities as de-icing salt. \nIn recent years a new access r\noadway \nhas been driven \ninto the underlying polyhalite seam and \nCPL is\n the only mine in the world producing this mineral \nthat \nhas a value as a fertiliser\n mineral.\n \nCPL contrib\nutes £225M per year economic activity as measured by product sales\n and much more by other economic measures\n.  Much of \nthe\n vendor spend is local\n,\n supporting many small suppliers and service companies.  Half \nthe company’s \nsales are overseas with approximate \nforeign earnings of £100M\n+\n per year.\nAlthough \nCPL\n employ approximately 900 persons in high quality jobs, a further 150 full time contract\nor\n employ\nees\n work at the mine\n, totalling over 1\n,\n050 persons. \nAll direct employees are employed at our Boulby Mine \nand the\n nearby export terminal on the river Tees. A socio-economic study of \nCPL’s\n impact suggested and confirmed that \nthe mine s\nupport\ns\n approximately 4,000 up-stream and down-stream jobs with a predominantly regional impact.  At any one time, the equivalent of t\nhree\n full time employees are travelling the world for meetings with parent company, suppliers, customers, trade bodies\n, conferenc\nes and other representations.\n \nCPL\n \nnote \nthat the decline of the UK extracti\nve industry means that the UK is no longer a centre for extractive industries.  The decline of mining and quarrying activities has had a knock-on effect with a decline in UK suppliers of \nessential \nproducts such as mining machinery and day to day equipment \nthat increasingly have to be sourced outside the UK and even outside Europe. \nNot at all. Increa\nsingly the expertise for extractive industry in the UK \nhas been retired or made redundant or unemployed so that it has become difficult\n,\n if not impossible\n,\n to recruit suitably qualified personnel \nfrom this country. T\nhose mining companies\n that \nhave working mines in the UK \nhave almost all \nbeen \ntaken over by foreign owned companies\n that are quoted on markets other than London\n.  \nThe UK has reputational risk because of the cost driven quality of their environmental impact assessments for\n their operations.  \nThe knowledge b\nase of the financial institutions needs to be much greater so they can understand \nthe complex \ntechnical and environmental issues rather than\n a \nn\na\nïve\n superficial knowledge\n. \nCPL has many interactions with the NGO sector \ntake great \npride in the high level of local and regional knowledge and understanding of \nthe mine’s\n operations as we\nll as the very low level of objections to new or renewed licence applications.\n \nAlthough not the \nNGO\n sector\n, CPL at its Boulby Mine is hosting an increasingly internationally significant range of research activities that utilises the ultra-low radiation ba\nckground to be found in the mine as well as its great depth (1,100m) which attenuates solar radiation by a factor 106.  \nCPL h\nave hosted the STFC funded UK Dark Matter search since 1985 but recently the range of activities  have been expanded under the \nSTFC\n \nFutures Programme to include\n:-\n \nThis is in addition to \nthe company’s \nown long term joint research project with Durham University investigating mining subsidence and coastal eros\nion and the range of natural and anthropomorphic influences upon this important natural phenomenon.  Cost effective methods of wide area monitoring have been investigated and models constructed of the mechanisms for cliff recession that have worldwide impl\nications. Recent additional interest in this unique research space has the potential to widen the scope of research even further with implications for UK plc Intellectual Property and that may bring additional benefits for underground operations worldwide.\nNo – the skills base for the extractive industry worldwide is diminishing with the UK seemingly setting the lead in that decline. \nCPL \nare finding it increasingly difficult to recruit suitably qualified persons in the UK and increa\nsingly applicants for mana\ngement\n positions \nare from mining areas in other parts of the world with Commonwealth and European countries predominating.  Technical positions are increasingly attracting applicants from those mining areas of Europe that are contracting through re-structu\nring.  \nAlthough most of \nthe \nmining staff are “home grown” \nwith \nover 400 \nstaff \nwith 25 year long-service awards and several with 40 year service\n awards\n, \nthe company \nrecently recruited several miners from a UK coal mine that was closing, in advance of the n\need for such staff.  This allows the opportunity to re-train them in potash mining techniques in time for \nlocal\n needs.  \nI\nt \nis \nincreasingly difficult to recruit “green miners” locally and regionally.\n \nCPL has no objections or comments regarding shale gas op\nerations but would like to draw the Select Committee’s attention to the possibility that shale gas operations have the potential to compromise working mines. This may happen by injudicious opening of faults and fractures that could possibly act as conduits\n for gas or liquids to enter mine workings that hitherto were immune from such activity.  There is a strong case that shale gas and fracking operations \nshould not take place within 10km of working mines\n (although this distance could be reduced if better kn\nowledge about the shale gas operation and its impact on the existing mine workings was available)\n.\nEITI has absolutely no impact on CPL\n’s \noperations that exceed \nall \nthe EITI criteria \nbut \nfrom \nthe\n position as a player in the global mining industry\n,\n \nthe UK signing up to \nEITI is welcome.\n \nSome London listed companies are exemplars of environmentally acceptable mining operations around the world, others are less so.\nExtractive industry outputs are \nincreasingly \nbecoming international commodities and indigenous industries are being bought up by foreign companies \nseeking \nglobal market \npositions\n.  Increasingly foreign ownership spells \nuncertainty for the UK operations\n that can be reduced by more government support to this sector\n.\n&#xa0;\nDavid Pybus, External Affairs Manager.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.iclfertilizers.com/Fertilizers/ClevelandPotash/Pages/BUHomepage.aspx\n \n \nhttp://www.polysulphate.com/index.php\n \n"
