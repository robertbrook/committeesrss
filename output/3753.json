"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Kenneth MacLean [FBB0019]&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThis submission is comprised of my replies to and observations relating to\n \nquestions set forth in the Committeeʼs press release of 22 October 2013.\n&#xa0;\nI write as a person who\n has listened to BBC radio since the 1940s and viewed\n \nBBC television since the 1950s.\n&#xa0;\nAt the end of this document is a statistics section which presents statistics\n \nillustrative of the size of the BBC in the UK media world.\n&#xa0;What should the BBC be for and what should be the purpose of public service broadcasting?&#xa0;\nPerhaps the easiest way to approach the first limb of this question is to ask\n \nʻ\nWhat should the BBC \nnot\n be for?ʼ.\n&#xa0;\nMy \nhigh level \nanswer to this reversed question is both simple and emphatic:\n \nthe BB\nC should not exist to provide the type and quality of radio, TV and\n \nonline content that is, or could be, provided by commercial media\n \norganisations.\n&#xa0;\nIf the BBC does little or nothing of significance over and above mimicking\n \nprivate sector media organisati\nons, then it has no reason to exist at all.\n&#xa0;\nAnd for the avoidance of doubt, the veracity of this observation is in no way\n \nlessened because the BBC happens to be a giant news and current affairs\n \norganisation. Clearly, a raison dʼêtre\n for the BBC cannot reside in its size\n \nalone.\n&#xa0;\nA further question thus arises, namely ʻDoes the BBC do anything of\n \nsignificance that could not readily be done by other media organisations?ʼ.\n&#xa0;\nI address this further question in my answer below to the Commit\nteeʼs\n \nquestion concerning the scope, scale and remit of the BBC.\nHow well has the BBC performed in the current Charter period in achieving its mission and public purposes?&#xa0;\nBeing but an ordinary viewer and listener, I was not familiar with the concept of\n \nthe BBCʼs mission but the BBC website soon informed me that the BBC has a\n \nMission ʻto enrich peopleʼs lives with programmes and services that inform,\n \neducate and entertainʼ.\n&#xa0;\nI am obliged to the BBC in seeking to enrich me because my annual TV tax\n \ntogether\n with that of a multitude of others certainly enriches many senior\n \nmanagers and celebrities at the BBC.\n&#xa0;\nGoogling the term ʻpublic purposesʼ immediately located it for me as being in\n \nthe BBC Charter. I was thus able to observe that the first Public Purpose\n of the\n \nBBC is ʻsustaining citizenship and civil societyʼ. I was left wondering if the\n \ncitizen is to exclaim “Gosh, what a wondrous thing is the BBC” or whether he\n \nis to think to himself “Crikey, a bit Orwellian that!”.\n&#xa0;\nMy seeking enlightenment in this \nvein also yielded an insight into the ways in\n \nwhich the BBC Trust attempts to impart to the management the strategy that\n \nthe Trust has formulated and the tools that have been constructed for\n \nattempting to monitor the performance of the management. In this \ncontext I\n \nobserved that there exist \ninter alia \nStrategic Objectives whereby, for example,\n \nthe Trust ʻchallengesʼ the BBC to increase the distinctiveness and quality of\n \noutput, Service Licences, Protocols, Public Purposes and Purpose Remits,\n \nAnnual Tracking\n Surveys, Statements of Programme Policy and Summary\n \nWorkplans.\n&#xa0;\nI conclude that the objectives given to the BBC by the Charter (plus\n \nFramework Agreement) are largely of a high-flown flannel nature and that the\n \nmachinery for setting the direction of the BB\nC and for assessing performance\n \nis so hideously bureaucratic and so formulaic when put into practice that\n \nmeaningful results are hardly to be expected.\n&#xa0;\nFor these reasons I am unable to provide a direct answer to the subject\n \nquestion. I would, however, lik\ne to attempt to provide some relevant\n \nobservations to the Committee, and these now follow.\n&#xa0;\nI suggest that it is very useful in examining the BBCʼs performance to adopt a\n \nlong timescale and to concentrate on television services.\n&#xa0;\nUp until the mid-1950s the\n BBC had a monopoly in TV and I distinctly remember, although I was a teenager, my apprehension when it was announced that commercial TV was to be introduced. I was worried that commercial TV would affect deleteriously the standards of BBC TV. \n&#xa0;\nI cannot p\nretend to remember the exact chronology, but the upshot over a\n \ncertain timescale was as feared. The BBC did not stand firm on quality\n \nstandards, but gave in to the temptation of attempting to maintain ratings as\n \nagainst what it perceived to be rival servic\nes.\n&#xa0;\nThe psychology of the BBCʼs reaction to the inception of commercial TV could\n \nnot be more simple. The BBC bigwigs apprehended that the punters who paid\n \nthe bigwigsʼ salaries and underpinned the bigwigsʼ careers would begin to\n \ncomplain if they had to \npay compulsorily a licence fee for programmes the\n \nviewership figures of which fell below those of the commercial services.\n&#xa0;\nThe adoption of the ratings chasing policy was thus driven by a desire for self\n-\npreservation.\n \nIn the demotic the policy goes, of cou\nrse, by the name of ʻratings\n \nwarʼ. The BBC became adept at fighting the ratings war and it has maintained\n \nto the present day its view that being active in that war is vital to the BBCʼs\n \ncontinued existence.\n&#xa0;\nThis plain and simple fact about the BBC is publ\nicly admitted by very few of\n \nour parliamentarians. Indeed, the flow over the years of MPs and peers who\n \nget upon their feet to proclaim that the BBC provides the ʻgold standardʼ of\n \nbroadcasting quality has never ceased.\n&#xa0;\nIs it a prerequisite of being a pol\nitician that one can selectively fail to see\n \nelephants in the room? Whatever the answer to that question, the fact is that\n \nwhilst operating ostensibly under strict requirements as to the maintenance of\n \nhigh standards, the BBC has in fact been permitted for\n sixty years, and by all\n \nparties, to consistently produce a general output at that low level which is\n \ndictated by ratings considerations.\n&#xa0;\nThis means that scandalously the public have been, and still are being,\n \ncharged, on a compulsory basis, for a sub-sta\nndard product.\n&#xa0;\nWhat scope, scale and remit should the BBC have?&#xa0;\nAs I intimated in my answer to the first question, the BBC should be\n \ngiven scope, scale and remit only if it can provide output which is significantly\n \ndifferent from that which is deliverable by other organisations, including\n \ncommercial companies. A requirement additional to difference is, of course,\n \npublic value.\n&#xa0;\nAs I explained with reference to the second question, albeit that the BBC operates under a\n cloak of ultra-respectable Public Purposes etc., it has in fact over a very long period chosen to maintain a dumbed down output as its continuous response to the output of what it sees as its rivals.\n&#xa0;\nHere then we have a problematic situation. In choosing\n to dumb down its\n \noutput to bolster its programme ratings the BBC has \nipso facto \nbrought itself\n \ndown to the level of its rivals. And in doing this, it has extinguished any\n \njustification for claiming to be significantly different from its rivals.\n&#xa0;\nAt this j\nuncture perhaps I hear members of the Committee saying “But what\n \nabout the BBCʼs output of news and current affairs?”. “Surely everyone\n \nacknowledges the BBCʼs pre-eminence in that sphere”.\n&#xa0;\nWell, let us consider a comparison of the quality of a commercial \nTV news\n \nservice, Sky News, and a prominent BBC TV news service, BBC News 24.\n&#xa0;\nIt cannot be seriously said that one of these services is significantly\n \nsuperior or significantly inferior to the other. Individuals may, of course, favour\n \none over the other bec\nause of personal preference or merely through\n \nhabit.\n&#xa0;\nHere it is pertinent to note from the statistical section (pp. 14 &amp; 15) that\n \nwhen it comes to users of the most used TV news sources, most rate\n \nthem reasonably highly in respect of accuracy, trustworthi\nness and impartiality.\n \nAnd, as the table on page 15 shows, the news services of ITV and Sky are\n \nrated very much on a par with those of the BBC.\n&#xa0;\nThe broadcast media have from their inception been seen as potent in their\n \npotential for upholding the democrat\nic values of this country but representing\n \nequally potently a threat to democracy should they to come under undesirable\n \ncontrol. At the nub of these considerations is the broadcasting of news.\n&#xa0;\nPoliticians, in providing for an appropriate framework for the\n operation of the\n \nbroadcast media, have thus put special effort into attempting to ensure that all\n \nradio and TV organisations which broadcast news items do so in a fair,\n \naccurate, impartial etc. manner. Indeed, it may be said that the provision of\n \nnews acc\nording to these criteria lies at the very heart of the concept of public\n \nservice broadcasting, whether one has in mind the BBC or the public service\n \nobligations of the other broadcasters.\n&#xa0;\nThus if it is the case that the public see BBC news provision as on\n a level with\n \nthe news provision of other providers, that is, if it does not see the BBCʼs news\n \nprovision as being distinctly more accurate, trustworthy and impartial, then the\n \nBBC has failed the \nAcid Test of Differentiation\n.\n&#xa0;\nIf there was any question of \nthe TV news output of non-BBC organisations\n \nbeing significantly inferior to that of the BBC as judged on the crucial criteria\n \naforementioned, this would be a matter of loud, prolonged and general debate,\n \nnot least,\n \nof course, on prog\nr\nammes such as \nQuestion\n Time. \nNo such debate\n \nexists.\n&#xa0;\nNow as I have already pointed out, in choosing to engage in the ratings war\n \nthe BBC has had to generally dumb down its output to the level of its rivals. As\n \nto whether this general dumbing down includes the BBCʼs news and rel\nated\n \nprogrammes can be left for debate, because as has been established the BBC\n \nfails the news-specific \nAcid Test of Differentiation.\n&#xa0;\nThe logic thus is that the BBC does not warrant scope, scale or remit because\n \nits continued existence cannot be justified\n on PSB grounds.\n&#xa0;\nThat is not to say that the continued existence of the BBC at a drastically\n \nreduced scale (size) might not be justified. On this basis I will now make some\n \nremarks on the present size and scope of activities of the BBC and as to what\n \nmight be an appropriate size/scope in the future.\n&#xa0;\nIn my consideration of the size/scope of the present BBC I have in mind the\n \nBBC as a provider of radio, TV and online services.\n&#xa0;\nMy contention is that the BBC is far too big. In my view the BBC has been\n \npe\nrmitted to grow to such an extent that it now constitutes a danger to vital\n \nelements of the UK media industry including commercial radio and TV,\n \nnational and local, and to local and national newspapers. The BBC is a grave\n \nimpediment to the establishment of\n a healthily diverse media scene in the UK.\n&#xa0;\nI will not dwell on the deleterious effects that BBC TV and radio are having on\n \nthe general media because I am certain that others far more authoritative than\n \nI will make submissions to the Committee. All that I\n will do is to underline the\n \nfact that it is only in a healthily diverse media scene that the public are\n \nexposed to a range of different opinions, views and information from a variety\n \nof sources.\n&#xa0;\nThe dominance of the BBC over the three major platforms (TV\n, radio and online) is\n \namply testified to by facts presented in the statistics section, but it might be helpful\n \nhere to highlight some specific facts about the BBCʼs news dominance which are\n \nrevealed in the said section.\n&#xa0;\nAccording to one survey, 78% of those who follow the news use TV therefor,\n \nwith 40% using newspapers, 35% radio and 32% the internet. See \np. 11\n.\n&#xa0;\nAccording to another survey, using slightly different methodology, the figures\n \nare: TV 85%, radio and newspape\nrs 53% each and internet 41%. See \np. 12\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe BBCʼs cross-platform audience reach for news at the retail level is 86%,\n \nthe second and third places being taken by ITV (40%) and Sky (28%). See \np.\n \n13\n.\n&#xa0;\n[Clearly all three platforms, but especially TV, are impo\nrtant for news and thus\n \ndominance over three platforms, including TV, must be very concerning.]\n&#xa0;\n75% of all TV news viewers use BBC One as a news source, the second most\n \nused being ITV (42%). Also, of the top six TV news services, three are BBC.\n \nSee p. \n15\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe BBCʼs share of news by channel group increased between 2002 and 2011\n \nfrom 59% to 74%. See p. \n14.\n&#xa0;\nIn respect of the BBC radio presence, the BBC UK-wide radio stations include\n \nthe top three radio stations (Radio 4, Radio 2 and Radio 1) used for news.\n \nMoreover, out of the top fifteen stations, nine are BBC and in aggregate BBC\n \nUK-wide radio stations account for two-thirds of those who use radio for news.\n \nSee p. \n15\n.\n&#xa0;\nAs to the BBC presence \nonline\n, of the 41% of UK adults who use the internet\n \nfor news, 57% use the BBC website or a BBC app, with Facebook and Google\n \ntaking 19% share each. Sky takes 17%. See p. \n15\n.\n&#xa0;\nIn December 2011 there were nine online news brands reaching over 2 m\n \npeople per month. Of these the BBC had the highest reach with 1\n1 m Second\n \nand third came DMGT (6.6 m) and Yahoo (4.1 m). BSkyB came in with 1.3 m.\n \nSee p. \n15\n.\n&#xa0;\nThere can be no doubt that the BBC is a giant organisation \nper se. \nThis can be\n \nready appreciated by merely examining the list of UK Public Services given in the\n \nJune 2006 Framework Agreement. And as amply demonstrated by the statistics\n \nsection, the BBC is a true monster in the news arena. It is thus not surprising that\n \naccording to a recent DCMS consultation document on media plurality, the 2011\n \nnews and current \naffairs spend of the BBC was more than that of the remaining UK\n \ntelevision and radio news broadcasters combined.\n&#xa0;\nAdded to the picture of overwhelming dominance in news provision is the startling\n \nfact that the BBC possess this dominant position not only in\n broadcasting but within\n \nand across the three major news platforms of radio, TV and online.\n&#xa0;\nFurthermore it is most important to have cognisance of the fact that owing to the\n \nsynergistic interaction between the platforms of the multi-platform BBC, the BBC \nhas\n \na power more than congruent with the sum of its parts.\n&#xa0;\nAll this very disturbing because what it means is that not only does the BBC fail to be\n \ndifferentiated from other media organisations when it comes to TV broadcasting,\n \nnews or general, but in the \nnews function it is a giant which holds an overwhelmingly\n \ndominant position across radio, TV and online.\n&#xa0;\nThus all that does differentiate the BBC are the features of 1. giant size, 2. \nT\nhe\n \nabsence of advertisements (at least commercial ones) and 3. the imp\nosition of the\n \nTV tax.\n&#xa0;\nIn the present context, as well as embracing the concept of size, the word ʼscopeʼ\n \nconnotes ʻrange of activitiesʼ and this raises a very serious and concerning aspect of\n \nthe BBC in its present form.\n&#xa0;\nIn the BBC Charter one of the BB\nCʼs Public Purposes is ʻhelping to deliver to the\n \npublic the benefit of emerging communications technologiesʼ. In non-spin language\n \nwhat this means is that the BBC is licensed to spend TV tax payersʼ money to\n \nextend its activities from radio and TV to onli\nne. This is reflected in the 2006\n \nFramework Agreement as ʻa comprehensive online content service, with content\n \nserving the whole range of the BBCʼs Public Purposesʼ, meaning that the extension\n \nto online is to be a wholesale one.\n&#xa0;\nAs above shown the BBC has\n taken full advantage of this carte blanche and it has\n \nspent highly - at an annual rate of £177m (2012/13 BBC Financial Statements) \n–\n in\n \nestablishing its commanding presence for news online, although as noted in the\n \nstatistics section (pp. 15 &amp; 16) users o\nf news websites rated Sky as fully equivalent\n \nto the BBC for accuracy &amp; reliability, trustworthiness and impartiality &amp; lack of bias.\n&#xa0;\nWhat then is so very serious and concerning about the BBCʼs so establishing itself in\n \nthe new communications medium of on\nline? An indication was given very recently by\n \nthe Home Secretary in a speech she gave to a gathering of the Society of Editors. In\n \nher speech Mrs May made the following observations.\n&#xa0;\n“\nLocal newspapers are having a particularly hard time. That has been pa\nrtly the\n \nresult of the BBCʼs dominant position on the internet, and its ability to subsidise the\n \nprovision of internet news using the licence fee. This makes it enormously difficult for\n \nlocal newspapers to compete. If the BBC can, as they do, provide all t\nhe locally\n \nsignificant news, what is left to motivate the local reader to buy a paper?\n&#xa0;\nIt is destroying local newspapers and it could eventually happen to national\n \nnewspapers as well.\n&#xa0;\nThis is dangerous for local politics as it is for local journalism.”\n&#xa0;\n“This is a debate that wonʼt go away and I believe that the BBC has to think carefully\n \nabout its presence locally and the impact that has on local democracy.”\n&#xa0;\nNo doubt Mrs May, as a senior cabinet minister, was being somewhat circumspect with her comments\n on the BBCʼs online services, but she certainly identified a grave threat to the print media, both local and national. \n&#xa0;\nIn the years running up to the commencement of the present Charter it may have\n \nappeared simply logical to permit the TV tax funded BBC\n to extent itself onto the\n \nnew online platform. But with the advantage of hindsight we can see that what the\n \npoliticians did in giving the thumbs-up was rather like that done, with equal facility, by\n \nthe Sorcererʼs Apprentice.\n&#xa0;\nWhereas news services of the\n broadcast media are regulated as to impartiality, the\n \nnewspapers are left to grind whatever political or other axe their proprietors fancy.\n \nThus from a political point of view we have on the left the Daily Mirror, the Financial\n \nTimes, the Guardian and the\n Independent, on the right the Daily Express, the Daily\n \nMail and the Telegraph and with a flexible approach (over time) to position on the\n \npolitical spectrum the Sun and the Times.\n&#xa0;\nThe freedom of the press to choose attitudes to news items and issues \nprovides the\n \npublic with an opportunity to be made aware of a wide range of arguments and\n \nopinions and is \nat the very heart of our democracy in the UK\n.\nTherefore any news media entity which poses an existential threat to the newspaper\n \nindustry, whether in \nrespect of printed newspapers or online services, must be\n \nexamined by Parliament with the upmost seriousness and \nurgency, this being all the\n \nmore the case when the entity in question is a public sector entity and thus one\n \nwhich is within the direct sphere \nof influence of Parliament.\n&#xa0;\nIn looking to the future, I am not at all sure what would be an appropriate remit for\n \nthe BBC. As I have indicated above, in the present era there would appear to no\n \nmore justification for a nationalised broadcaster and online \noperator than there is for\n \na public sector newspaper.\n&#xa0;\nI do not, of course, expect to see the BBC disappear suddenly, but it is important to\n \nthe future of democracy in our country that as soon as possible it is drastically\n \ndecreased both in scope and scale\n.\n&#xa0;\nIn its present form the BBC is stifling media diversity and threatening the continued\n \nexistence of our newspapers. This means that the BBC constitutes a threat to our\n \ndemocracy.\n&#xa0;\nA much reduced BBC, or a successor organisation, could have one of a numbe\nr of\n \nprofiles, but as an indicator I would suggest that the following would be appropriate.\n&#xa0;\nTV  One general channel approximating to an amalgam of present BBC One and\n \nBBC Four, plus BBC Parliament Channel. No regional/local TV services.\n&#xa0;\nRadio  Two\n national channels, approximating respectively to present channels 4 and\n \n3. No local stations.\n&#xa0;\nOnline  Excepting for content strictly connected with BBC services, such as\n \nprogramme listings, BBC Online should be cut away from the BBC to form a\n \nseparate en\ntity funded by subscription. An alternative would be a separation of BBC\n \nNews, including online news, from the remainder of the BBC, again funded by\n \nsubscription.\n&#xa0;\nMy indications of a future BBC or successor will to some appear over-drastic, but\n \nsuch is th\ne state of the present BBC that in the interests of a healthy democracy it is\n \nin dire need of brutal surgery.\n&#xa0;\nReturning to the question of remit, in the light of my observations all I can advise is\n \nthat any new Public Purposes or the like are couched in \nterms less Orwellian and\n \nless high-flown than is the case in the present Charter. I would also put in a plea that\n \nthe Big Brother/social engineering tenor of the PSB purposes and characteristics set\n \nout by Ofcom in its PSB Annual Report 2013 (Fig. 1) is fi\nrmly eschewed.\n&#xa0;\nWhat role should the BBC play in developing technology and new ways of distributing content?&#xa0;\nThe development of technology relating to TV, radio or online and novel modes of\n \ndistributing content/information/data is the province of the \nlikes of Google, Apple and\n \nSamsung, and not that of a UK public sector broadcasting organisation.\n&#xa0;\nHow should the BBC be funded beyond 2016?&#xa0;\nThe TV tax is very unpopular, especially in view of the multitude of sources of\n \ninformation and entertainment now \navailable to the public on TV (and elsewhere).\n&#xa0;\nIn my view the idea of imposing a compulsory tax on the UK public in respect of one\n \nout of a multitude of media outlets is a totally unjustified anachronism. Much would\n \nbe the rejoicing among the populace upo\nn the lifting of this unfair imposition.\n&#xa0;\nLooking at the matter from a different angle, if the BBCʼs current output truly\n \nrepresents the gold standard of quality in broadcasting as some parliamentarians\n \nregularly claim, why should not the BBC be funded, an\nd funded only, by the\n \nvoluntary subscriptions of members of the public.\n&#xa0;\nAs set forth above, it is clear that the BBCʼs online services in respect of news are\n \nthreatening the continued existence of national and local newspapers. This supplies\n \nanother and v\nital reason as to why, if the BBC is to be permitted to continue to put\n \nout news and current affairs online, the BBC should be funded on a subscription\n \nbasis.\n&#xa0;\nWe have had ample evidence of late as to the BBCʼs talent for wasting TV tax\n \npayersʼ money as we\nll as to other management shortcomings. Thus an advantage of\n \nfunding the BBC on a subscription basis is that the BBC would, for the first time,\n \nhave to earn its income. This would tighten up management.\n&#xa0;\nHow should the BBC be governed, regulated and held accountable?&#xa0;\nIt is surely clear that the replacement of BBC governors by the BBC Trust has been\n \na true failure. One cannot be surprise at this since any objective person would\n \nperceive immediately that the concept of a body a part of the BBC being \nresponsible\n \nfor overseeing the BBC and at the same time representing the TV tax payer was\n \ndoomed to failure.\n&#xa0;\nThus the BBC, whether it is to exist in the near future in its giant, overbearing,\n \ncompetition suppressing , democracy threatening form or not, mu\nst be regulated by\n \na body outside the BBC. Whether that body is Ofcom in its present or a modified\n \nform is a moot point, but future regulation must be external of the BBC.\n&#xa0;\nUK Media Statistics&#xa0;Introduction&#xa0;\nThis statistics section presents statistics \nillustrative of the present shape of the UK\n \nmedia and more especially of the extent of the BBCʼs operations and of the size of\n \nits presence in the UK media world.\n&#xa0;\nEmphasis is placed on the provision of news services. The reason for this is simply\n \nthat the\n availability of a plurality of news sources is essential to the healthy working\n \nof a democracy. In this context “plurality” connotes many rather than few news\n \nservices and, just as importantly, the avoidance of any one media organisation\n \nhaving too much i\nnfluence over public opinion and over the political process.\n&#xa0;\nSeeking to ensure the existence of many and diverse news sources and the\n \nabsence of too much media power in one or a few hands is the only way of\n \npromoting range and diversity of information and\n opinion.\n&#xa0;\nThe statistics have been derived predominantly from Ofcom documents or from\n \nreport documents commissioned by Ofcom. Abbreviations used in the text to refer to\n \nsuch documents are as follows.\n&#xa0;\n“A4” to “A6” -\n              \nAnnexes, so respectively referenced, to\n \nMeasuring media plurality,\n \nOfcomʼs advice to DMCS, published 19 June 2012\n&#xa0;\n“CMR13” - \n              \nCommunications Market Report 2013\n, Ofcom Research Document,\n \npublished 1 August 2013\n&#xa0;\nMedia Generally&#xa0;\n91% of UK adults say they follow the news. 78% use TV for news, 40%\n use print\n \nnewspapers, 35% use radio and 32% use the internet (CMR13 1.9.3 &amp; Fig. 1.93).\n&#xa0;\nWhen respondents were asked to what extent they used each platform for types of\n \nnews, i.e. serious news items, breaking news, headlines &amp; summaries, opinions &amp;\n \ndebate\ns and in-depth analysis, TV dominated in each of the 5 categories, only losing\n \nits dominance when it came to light hearted stories and rumour &amp; gossip (A4 Fig. 2).\n&#xa0;\nBy way of example, A4 Fig. 2 shows that for serious news 81% said they used TV,\n \nwhereas the\n scores for newspapers, radio and the internet were 42%, 38% &amp; 44%\n \nrespectively.\n&#xa0;\nUsing somewhat different methodology, Kantar Media reported (A5) that 95% of UK\n \nadults claim to follow the news via at least one of the four major platforms and that\n \nTV has t\nhe highest reach at 85%, followed by radio and newspapers with 53% each\n \nand internet with 41%. Internet news usage is on a growing trend (A4 4.8).\n&#xa0;\nWhen consumers were asked to rate the importance of platforms to them and the\n \nratings were plotted against p\nercentage usage for news, TV was rated highest in\n \nimportance at 88%, with radio and newspapers both at 55% and internet on\n \ncomputer at 37% (A5 Chart 3.1.1b).\n&#xa0;\nIn 1970 73% of UK adults used newspapers as a source of news.
