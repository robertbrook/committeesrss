[[[Jane Green BA Hons Economics and Admin]]]1. I am an independent economist and researcher and have made a particular study of incinerator PFIs. I campaign for Zero Waste and am a West Midlands ‘Green Leader’. In the past year I have spoken at the Zero Waste International Alliance Conference in San Francisco and to the European Parliament in Brussels in support of a petition concerning lack of community ‘Access to Justice’ in regard to waste infrastructure.  2. Summary Pointsa)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The drive to build municipal waste incinerators began about 15 years ago following the introduction of the Landfill tax which aimed to drive waste away from landfill which releases climate-changing methane gas. The amount of diversion from landfill thought possible by recycling was just 25%.b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Since then recycling has reached 42% in England and 52% in Wales with a welsh target of 70% by 2025. The waste hierarchy which prioritises prevention, re-use, recycling and composting, over landfill and incineration, became a legal requirement in England and Wales in 2011. c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Nearly all local authority incinerators have been built using PFI/PPP and because of the extremely high costs, often totalling around £1 billion each, the Government has been distributing £3.5 billion in PFI credits to around 28 projects as subsidies.d)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; However the need for councils to build their own incinerator no longer exists as there is not only an overcapacity of UK ‘residual’ waste treatment predicted for 2015 but there is now a highly competitive waste market for all waste treatment including ‘end of pipe’ processes such as incineration at far lower gate fees.e)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The risks to council budgets of 25-30 year incinerator contracts has risen dramatically as it is the council who takes the risk of increases in recycling or future Environmental Legislation leading to unpaid or underpaid spare capacity.f)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Both DEFRA and the Treasury have a major involvement in a council’s decision to choose incineration and both have their own measures of Value for Money which are not in line with those of VfM for individual local authority Business Cases. The Treasury is prioritising large infrastructure projects to achieve national economic growth.  DEFRA is agreeing local VfM based on national targets limited to only 2020 and has not attempted to cost the risk of foreseeable environmental legislation or recycling rates exceeding 50%. g)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;  The NAO have now begun an investigation into DEFRA’s VfM guidance to councils with regard to incinerator procurement but this may be too late for those councils who are presently signing up to 25-30 year contracts which involve unnecessary extra £millions from council budgets. h)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; I believe it is vital that the DCLG step in now to call for a moratorium for incinerator projects which have yet to have contracts signed. This would allow time to determine good value for money and whether the economic and environmental objectives of local authorities are being met. BackgroundThis paper will argue that local authority incinerator contracts are being signed without due diligence in relation to whether they are (a) affordable; (b) represent value for money; and (c) will not burden the Councils with unpredictable costs in the future. In particular it considers the assessment and management of risk and argues that this is inadequate for projects with a lifespan of 25-30 years which could therefore put future Council finances at risk.Incinerator projects should be able to prove that they can deliver a commercial benefit to the Councils over their 25 – 30 year economic life despite challenges to their business viability from an increasingly competitive waste market, increased recycling and foreseeable legislation which would restrict the types of waste which can be burnt.

[[[an increasingly competitive waste market. ]]]Financial Parameters1. Affordability Councils should be satisfied that the additional cost of the incinerator contract is affordable

[[[ ]]]in relation to:1. a) Council Budgets The estimated increase in costs for an incinerator above the existing waste budget, the ‘affordability gap’, will usually begin at around £6 million pa. The total costs of the incinerator are usually around £1bn. A council has to state that the ‘likely increases in costs’ have been included into its MTFP. Given that most MTFPs are only for 3-4 years this measure cannot mitigate risk for a 25 year project. The risk to Council finances has increased since the financial collapse, with reductions to council budgets making even medium term predictions of ‘affordability’ problematic. The ring-fencing of waste contract payments will necessitate greater percentage cuts to other Council budgets.Spare capacity and minimum tonnagesAll potential new incinerators are being built with excess capacity and to maintain commercial viability will need to sell this space at a price equivalent to the total cost per tonne, including finance and running costs of the plant, estimated to be around £130 per tonne. As councils will be contracted to pay for agreed tonnages for the 25 year period, every tonne which is not used, or used for ‘substitute waste’ which needs Council subsidy, will effectively put up the price per tonne to over £130.  This in effect acts as a ‘minimum tonnage’ imperative.2. Opportunity Costs Accessing the waste marketThe Opportunity Costs of incineration have increased dramatically for councils in the past several years and even for those whose procurement began 3-4 years ago. MSW can now be tendered on the competitive waste market far more cheaply (even for incineration or other ‘end of pipe’ solutions) and on shorter contracts than PPP new build. Best practice in waste management is also bringing the combined collection and disposal costs down when recyclables, including food waste, are collected separately and the waste treated ‘per stream’.  There has been transparency in waste treatment costs for the past 6 years with the publication of WRAP’s annual Gate Fees Reports which ‘presents a summary of gate fees for a range of waste treatment, recovery and disposal options. The indicative gate fees reported here are based on survey information from local authorities, MRF operators, compost facility operators, waste management companies (WMCs) and other market intelligence’. The opportunity costs of not accessing the waste market are therefore now very clear with all treatments apart from landfill being considerably cheaper than incineration and in the case of recycling actually paying councils. The information in these reports allows local authorities to make better informed decisions regarding waste management options but there is little evidence that the councils use this information. Overcapacity and falling gate feesAdrian Judge, now MD for Waste and Bioenergy at&#xa0;the UK Green Investment Bank, has warned against the risks of an oversupply of residual waste treatment capacity, ‘To properly assess the risks associated with finding the ‘right’ sort of substitute waste at this scale requires a detailed understanding of the local C&amp;I waste market, and this comes at a time when funders have a lowered appetite for merchant risk’. Waste is now a commodity like any other and one for which there is increasing competition in the UK and at a European level; due in part to overcapacity of incineration and increasing recycling. All incinerators in the West Midlands area have spare capacity and older incinerators like Coventry which have the historical advantage of established waste suppliers are able to charge around half the price which new build incinerators charge to remain commercially viable.DEFRA in their most recent ‘Forecasting 2020 Waste Arisings and Treatment Capacity’ suggests that ‘Spare capacity in EfW plants in Northern Europe may tempt some LAs to exploit the relatively low gate fees there through short- to medium-term contracts rather than enter into longer-term contracts for investment in new capacity in the UK’2. (f) Opportunity Costs of not following Best Practice OptionsThe opportunity cost of not following Best Practice in waste management could be avoided by the examination of best (and worst) practice across other Councils. DEFRA does not provide fully costed case studies of best practice to enable councils or the public to make comparisons. However, Eunomia Research recently produced a Report for a Council procuring an incinerator. It gives cost comparisons taking into account changing waste management systems and accessing the open waste market. Instead of a 240,000 tonne incinerator, they estimate that&#xa0;£10 million pa would be saved

[[[&#xa0;]]]by simply diverting recyclable materials out of the PFI contract and onto the open market. By getting out of the contract altogether&#xa0;£20 million per year could be saved.A Wychaven District Report ‘Value for Money. Waste service comparisons’  researched a comparable group of authorities and found that half of the authorities with high levels of recycling, including separate food waste collections, actually pay less for their waste services. They compare Wychaven at 44% recycling with South Oxfordshire at 65% but who pay 10% less on collections. The Audit Commission’s document ‘Well Disposed’ recommends that councils, ‘Work in partnership with WCAs where relevant, to ensure that waste management performance is optimised across the local area. This may involve supporting investment in new collection infrastructure in WCAs, where this could improve cost-effectiveness for council taxpayers in the long term’. Often councils do not look at the savings that could be made in combined disposal and collection costs.There is usually no up-to-date independent review undertaken of incinerator proposals in order to assess the opportunity cost of best practice elsewhere or risk assessments, or to compare 25 year incinerator contracts versus modular and more flexible options. This is important because the early project weightings which determine a choice of incineration are heavily weighted towards ‘technical’ and ‘bankability’ aspects and do not reflect present day environmental concerns or employment and social dimensions.6. DEFRA must agree Variation on VfM grounds. DEFRA is being investigated by the National Audit Office in relation to its Value for Money Assessments for LA waste incineration plants. A decision by DEFRA to back a scheme and offer grants of millions of pounds is usually enough to convince a council that building its own multi-million pound incinerator is a good business proposition. However DEFRA’s decisive role in assessing the long term risks of changing waste legislation and technologies, management systems and markets in relation to costs and VfM is now being examined. In fact DEFRA explains its promotion of incinerator projects in terms of the short term National imperative to meet landfill reduction targets by 2020 rather than developing sound long term environmental and economic waste solutions for Local Authorities. As we approach the closure of the ‘waste treatment capacity gap’ by 2020 those councils singled out by DEFRA to get incinerators are left to face disproportionate risks compared to non-incinerator councils who are free to access short term contracts for spare capacity whilst developing newer, cheaper and greener solutions, accessing the waste market and benefitting from the sale of recyclates.The degree to which DEFRA performs an independent scrutiny function for incinerator proposals has been questioned in Worcestershire where there is no record of communication between WCC and DEFRA on issues to do with VfM. In fact the Project’s Risk Matrix lists DEFRA itself as a risk needing mitigation: ‘Senior officers to ensure early and continuous engagement with key DEFRA officials throughout process 

[[[to ensure DEFRA buy in to scheme’]]]. Treasury influenceThe Treasury’s influence over the type of waste infrastructure available to LAs is via the PFI and WI grants it allows DEFRA, its provision of infrastructure guarantees and its choice of a Private Finance system which is biased towards large inflexible infrastructure on long contracts.PFI projects have been described as ‘eye-poppingly’ expensive by Hereford MP Jesse Norman and member of the Treasury Select Committee. The Treasury, in its overriding desire for infrastructure projects (which are funded ‘off-balance book’) to stimulate ‘growth’ has formed an ‘unholy alliance’ with the private contractors ‘which all but bypasses relevant departments in its drive to get deals done’.Following the multi-billion pound bail-outs of PFI hospitals in 2012 the NAO has warned of the cumulative impact of funding infrastructure which is paid for from budget revenue. The Public Accounts Committee when criticising the ‘spend now, pay later’ approach of the Treasury stated; ‘

[[[We were surprised to find that the Treasury did not h]]]

[[[ave a grip on trends in some key areas of risk or plans for managing them.]]]’ Contractual Parameters1. (b) Bringing the Waste Contract into compliance with current and foreseeable legislation.The OBC risk register for Worcestershire’s proposed incinerator is typical of other incinerator OBC’s when it states that if ‘the councils significantly exceed their recycling targets [and] the plant is oversized’, it will be ‘an additional cost to the Councils’. A change in ‘the calorific value of delivered residual waste’ is also stated to be ‘an additional cost to the Councils’.  The Councils are named as the ‘risk owners’ in the Risk Matrix for changes in legislation or guidance either at European, National or Regional/local level. These are very great risks for councils who will be unable to respond to the rapidly changing waste world without paying the private partner to provide extra new waste services or infrastructure. This process has already been witnessed by WCC where Mercia’s 15 year old waste contract has needed 56 variations costing £49 million in order to bring services in line with new environmental policy and legislation. The EU Waste Directive is proposing to ban the incineration of all recyclable and organic material by 2020 which could clearly result in incinerators becoming economically unviable. It appears that the recommendations of the Treasury Select Committee that ‘PFI is only likely to be suitable where the risks associated with future demand and usage of the asset can be efficiently transferred to the private sector’ have not been followed.DEFRA, who are tasked with applying the trajectory of waste policy in relation to incinerator sizing for waste contracts, forecasts recycling rates peaking at around 50% in 2020 and remaining static for the next 25 years. This appears to contradict both reality and its own Waste Strategy for moving towards a Zero Waste Society. Wales is already exceeding 50% nationally and like Scotland aims for 70-75% within a few years. The Audit Commission’s document ‘Well Disposed’ states ‘around 70% of household waste is readily recyclable’ which is confirmed by the top performing councils in England who are now achieving around 70%. Incinerator business cases are being passed by DEFRA without sensitivity analysis for 60 and 70 % recycling being carried out. Despite being a prime example of infrastructure involving long-term commercial risk incinerator projects have not had either the academic research or governmental monitoring and oversight which other large privately funded LA infrastructure have received. &#xa0;In contrast to the conservative predictions of DEFRA, and those parts of the waste industry wishing to secure incinerator contracts, the waste industry as a whole is gearing up to move its investment to the newer forms of waste treatment and sees ‘the waste market is evolving into one with shorter-term local authority contracts and contracts based on specific waste streams across municipal and commercial sectors.’ Investment will come from ‘Corporate investors…, the GIB…, overseas buyers attracted to both the scale of investment and pace of change in the market and Private equity attracted to the growth potential in areas such as recycling.’
