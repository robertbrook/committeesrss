"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nBlanchland\n Parish Council (TIC 27)\n&#xa0;How do Government and local authorities identify demand for passenger transport in isolated communities (including rural and urban areas and island communities)? \n&#xa0;\nBlanchland\n is a small rural parish with 124 adults on the electoral roll.\nPublic transport is allocated according to demand and cost per person per trip.\n&#xa0;\nTo what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers (e.g. people with disabilities, older people, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?&#xa0;\n An ADAPT bus comes to the village once per week to take elderly people with wheelchairs or walking aids to our market town for a short stay.\n&#xa0;\nWe have a bus which services the village twice per day Monday to Friday but not at convenient times for younger people to travel to work or attend regular leisure opportunities.\n&#xa0;\nWhat are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities? How can these challenges be overcome?&#xa0;\nPublic transport cannot operate without passengers and in rural communities young adults learn to drive as quickly as possible, gain their own transport o\nr move away.\n&#xa0;\nElderly people who no longer can drive or afford to run a car wish to move to where transport is more readily available. Rural transport tends not to fit in with Doctors, Dental and Hospital appointments! The majority of eldery people with \nBus passes would be quite happy to pay towards the journey if this meant having a convenient bus service.\n&#xa0;\nHow effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?&#xa0;\nTo what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive transport services?&#xa0;\nAs above, \nElderly people who no longer can drive or afford to run a car wish to move to where transport is m\nore readily available. Rural transport tends not to fit in with Doctors, Dental and Hospital appointments! These people should not have to rely on Taxis.\n&#xa0;\nAs regard to demand services if a resident books this in our village, a resident two miles away on \nthe same route at the same time is refused even though seats are available as this would extend the journey time and it may not be able to keep to its next scheduled pick up time.\n&#xa0;\nWhat are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities? How can these services be made more affordable?The cost of running buses for the low number of passengers. Having transport at convenient times to fit the needs of the community.\n&#xa0;\nThe majority of elderly\n people with Bus \npasses would be quite happy to pay towards the journey if this meant having a convenient bus service.\n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
