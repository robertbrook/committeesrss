[normal]Further written evidence from James Patrick [CST0073][bold]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction:[bold]Written evidence submitted to the Public Administration Select Committee by James John Patrick. This evidence is submitted in my capacity as holder of the independent office of Constable, warrant number P231501, but not on behalf of my 
[normal]current force the Metropolitan Police Service.
[normal]This evidence contains 2374 words and spreads over 5 pages. The content is true to the best of my knowledge and honest belief.
[normal]Summary of Evidence:[bold]The intent of this written submission is to provide additi
[normal]onal information, on the manipulation of robbery and theft crime statistics in London, which has arisen partially as a result of new data being obtained.
[normal]A.[bold] While substantial changes in governance have taken place, the issues are ongoing, perverse, cultur
[normal]al behaviour may already have adapted to the new regime and further change is needed.
[normal]B.[bold] The data shows the huge scale of the robbery versus theft issue in the MPS, about which I was personally concerned in 2011-2012 and was raised in my first submission.
[normal]Background:[bold]1.[bold] There have been for some time two systems in the Met, based upon the analytical software called Business Objects. One is called MetStats, and the other MetMIS. Both collect their data from other systems or databases, such as CRIS (the sys
[normal]tem into which crime reports are entered). Despite collating from the same databases, both MetStats and MetMis are updated with new data at different intervals, subsequently running the same search on each can produce varied results. MetMis was, so I was t
[normal]old by senior analysts, the system used to produce data for the Home Office and subsequently produces data compliant with the counting rules (HOCR). MetMis has now become the primary system in analytical use. The two platform system is chaotic.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.[bold] In July
[normal] 2011, the MPS FCR issued guidance on when Robbery should be classified, rather than Theft-Snatch. Also issued was guidance on recording crimes where third parties from agencies made reports of crime on behalf of vulnerable third parties. In August 2011 th
[normal]e FCR issued advice concerning the failure to record Robbery in the absence of an IMEI number if it was a phone that was stolen. The FCR advice highlighted that this was not a valid reason for not recording crime. It is clear that the FCR was well versed i
[normal]n the issues affecting the Met. It is also noteworthy that, considering the size of the MPS, FCR advisory notes available to all staff on the force intranet can be counted on both hands; this appears out of kilter.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.[bold] Largely in recognition of problems in
[normal] crime recording in the Met, and the management of it, the CMU departments were centralised and renamed as CRIB, incorporating crime management and telephone investigations. This was with the exception of SC&amp;O CMU which remains close to its commands, as I 
[normal]have previously highlighted. The phase one launch of CRIB was in October to 
[normal]November 2011. In an early briefing presentation for CRIB staff, dated the 4
[normal]th
[normal] of January 2012, it highlighted that 'Snatch' was to be recorded where force was only applied to prop
[normal]erty. The same briefing also gave staff direction on applying the '72 hour rule', which I will return to later in the evidence. Both of these inclusions in the CRIB staff briefing are part of a wider problem.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.[bold] It has long been established, through the C
[normal]ourt of Appeal in 
[normal]R v Clouden [1987],
[normal] that force can actually be applied to property in Robbery offences. The very basic explanation of the ruling is that 
[normal]“w
[normal]hether force had been used or not is a matter to be left to the jury”
[normal] and that 
[normal]“the jury were entit
[normal]led to conclude that pulling a bag down amounted to force. The old distinction between force on the actual person and force on property causing force on the person had gone”
[normal]. To illustrate that this is no secret legal principle, it appears on the Police Na
[normal]tional Legal Database – to which all officers have access – and the quoted description I've used here is taken from 
[normal]www.sixthformlaw.info
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. [bold]Following a meeting of the MPS Management Board on the 29
[normal]th
[normal] of Februa
[normal]ry 2012, it was announced on the 20th of March 2012 that the MPS classification codes for 'Theft Snatch' (0039/11) and 'Dip' (0039/12) would be merged into 'Theft Person' as 0039/00, effective at the 30
[normal]th
[normal] of March 2012. Had there been no issue, neither wou
[normal]ld the FCR have been issuing notices, nor would CRIB have been created, nor the codes amended. This is all from within the period to which my first evidence on robbery versus theft related.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6. [bold]I can vividly remember seeing a report, published on the intra
[normal]net by Performance Information (known as PIB), a short time after the changes took place. It showed that Theft Snatch had dropped to zero and that Theft From Person had increased by 400883%. The report was removed but clearly highlighted a real problem, as
[normal] far as how the Met had been looking at its crime data goes.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]7.[bold] In summary, up until the launch of CRIB (and until it was fully operational in 2012), Boroughs were in charge of their own crime management. Subsequently management pressure from the top of the Met to Borough Commanders was translated into local pressure 
[normal]from Borough Commanders to their own management teams, and then down through the ranks. This resulted in up to thirty-two (32) different responses to the pressure, including variations in 'gaming' or perverse actions. Local CMU's were just as susceptible t
[normal]o the local pressures as any other unit. The variations, doubtlessly, made the extent of the impact and scale of the problem very difficult to detect. With the launch of CRIB and the centralisation of crime management things have become more controlled, bu
[normal]t it also makes the scale of what was – and still is – happening easier to see. CRIB however is now subject to higher level management pressure more directly, which is as much of a risk to the Met as gaming and perverse behaviour being adapted to the new g
[normal]overnance structure.
[normal]Evidence:[bold]8.[bold] Under the Freedom of Information Act, data from the MetMis system has been obtained, pertaining to Robbery, Theft from Person and Other Thefts, covering the period 2009 to 2013. The data has been briefly analysed, lookin
[normal]g for anomalies, statistical deviance and change over the period discussed in points 1 to 7. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8a)[bold]. 2009: In the sampled quarter 4308 offences, 8.39% of reported AND recorded crime, disappeared from the three categories. Robbery was being initially under-r
[normal]ecorded at a rate of between 235 and 341 offences per month. Overall only 4.99% of crimes were resulting in a charge or other such detection but, while theft from person and other thefts had detection rates of 1.95-
[normal]2.67% and 2.84-3.15% respectively, robber
[normal]y had a rate of 16.16-18.01%
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8b)[bold]. 2010: In the sampled quarter 4440 offences, 7.95% of reported AND recorded crime, disappeared from the three categories. Robbery was being initially under-recorded at a rate of between 238 and 283 offences per month. Over
[normal]all only 5.81% of crimes were resulting in a charge or other such detection but, while theft from person and other thefts had detection rates of 1.91-2.71% and 2.92-3.56% respectively, robbery had a rate of 20.31-21.34%
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8c)[bold]. 2011:  In the sampled quarter 
[normal]4057 offences, 7.21% of reported AND recorded crime, disappeared from the three categories. Robbery was being initially under-recorded at a rate of between 299 and 406 offences per month – the numbers found incorrect increased at the time CRIB phase one wa
[normal]s launched. Overall only 5.27% of crimes were resulting in a charge or other such detection but, while theft from person and other thefts had detection rates of 1.66-2.06% and 2.90-3.27% respectively, robbery had a rate of 15.54-20.75%, the five percent dr
[normal]op taking place at the time CRIB phase one was launched.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8d)[bold]. It is the significant change, visible from the launch of CRIB, that confirms local pressure was significant issue affecting crime recording decisions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8e)[bold]. 2012: In the sampled quarter 3198 of
[normal]fences, 5.68% of reported AND recorded crime, disappeared from the three categories. Robbery was being initially under-recorded at a rate of between 539 and 703 offences per month AND Theft From Person was now being discovered as under-recorded at a rate o
[normal]f between 640 and 831 offences per month. Overall only 4.40% of crimes were resulting in a charge or other such detection but, while theft from person and other thefts had detection rates of 1.57-3.01% and 2.46-2.86% respectively, robbery had a rate of 13.
[normal]78-15.08%, reducing as the quarter progressed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8f)[bold]. It is here, with CRIB fully operational that the true scale of the issue is seen clearly. Theft from Person offences were found under-recorded in 2298 cases and robberies in 1845 cases. This also coincid
[normal]es with a further reduction in the detection rate for Robbery, while the overall detection rate also falls. The old gaming behaviours that had driven down figures and inflated detection rates no longer worked but were still clearly being attempted. What ha
[normal]d really changed was visibility.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8g)[bold]. 2013: In the sampled quarter 4138 fewer offences had been initially recorded than in the 2012 quarter, and 4614 fewer offences were subsequently confirmed than in the 2012 quarter. 3674 offences, 7.05% of reported AND
[normal] recorded crime, disappeared from the three categories. Robbery was being initially under-recorded at a rate of between 366 and 524 offences per month AND Theft From Person was being under-recorded at a rate of between 474 and 629 offences per month. Overa
[normal]ll only 4.51% of crimes were resulting in a charge or other such detection but, while theft from person and other thefts had detection rates of 1.96-2.26% and 2.85-3.2% respectively, robbery had a rate of 12.30-14.96%
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8h)[bold]. The significant drop in recorded
[normal] offences, both at initial and confirmed stages, is a concern, in particular as London now bucks the developing national trend of increasing crime. The concern is bolstered because the other behaviours shown in the statistics (e.g. under-recording and dete
[normal]ctions) suggest that very little has changed at all. I would be personally concerned that the developing 'gaming' or perverse behaviour is not recording crime in the first place.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.[bold] It is necessary to highlight the '72 hour rule' at this point. In 2006 the HMIC said the following of Merseyside Police: 
[normal]“The force is encouraging officers to maximise the 72-hour rule under NCRS to fully investigate the circumstances around reported crim
[normal]e. This will assist in the process of reducing the number of ‘non-crime’ after the event and assist in the correct categorisation. However, this will leave a lag in the performance-monitoring process and possibly impact on NIM (National Intelligence Model)
[normal]. In addition the force should ensure that only officers who are competent in NRCS are provided with this facility”. 
[normal]It is my understanding that the 72 hour rule is used as a 'cooling off' period and may impact upon the likelihood of victims pursuing their
[normal] complaints.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Conclusion:[bold]10.[bold] Because governance changes are now embedded and the simple patterns and exceptions are clear over five years, combined with my own first hand experience and the evidence of others it is my professional opinion and honestly he
[normal]ld belief that:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10a)[bold]. The Met is now also at risk of both 'gaming' or perverse behaviour AND not recording crime, and experts at the highest level are aware of the fact that this problem already occurs nationally, with only an estimated 70% of reported cr
[normal]ime being recorded by the police.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10b).[bold] That up until 2012, prior to the full establishment of CRIB, Robbery was almost certainly under-recorded in London at a rate of at least approximately 238 offences per month, or 714 per quarter, or 2,856 offences pe
[normal]r year. In the period 2009 to 2011 this equates to 8,570 victims of robbery not having received the quality of policing they deserved.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10c)[bold]. That up until 2012, prior to the full establishment of CRIB, Theft From Person was almost certainly under-recorded
[normal] in London at a rate of at least approximately 815 offences per month, or 2,446 per quarter, or 9,784 offences per year. In the period 2009 to 2011 this equates to 29,354 victims of theft not having received the quality of policing they deserved.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10d)[bold]. Th
[normal]at up until 2012, detection rates for robbery were artificially inflated and this in part hid the fact that 95% of crime in the three categories was going undetected, and still is now.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10e)[bold]. That up until 2012, prior to the full establishment of CRIB, cri
[normal]mes in the three categories were almost certainly 'dropped off the books' inappropriately, after initial recording, at a rate of at least approximately 277 offences per month, or 832 per quarter, or 3,329 offences per year. In the period 2009 to 2011 this 
[normal]equates to 9,988 victims of offences in these categories not receiving the quality of policing they deserve.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10f)[bold]. Referring to the previously raised issue of suspiciously similar, respective increases and decreases in Robbery and Theft From Person offenc
[normal]es, found in June 2013, there are potentially a further 273 offences of Robbery per month (8 per Borough) which are being under-recorded by category 'gaming'. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11.[bold] The volume, longevity, consistency and continuance of the issues, even in the face of FCR a
[normal]nd Management Board interventions, is clear in the statistics, as is the fact that CRIB has helped expose the scale of the issue but not resolved it. It is clear that the explanation of 'mistake' or 'error' does not ring true. There is a compelling link be
[normal]tween management pressure and under-recording behaviour, including in response to MOPAC7 targets, however well intentioned they may 
[normal]be. Knowledge is long held at the highest levels, as made clear by Lord Stevens, that police 'figures are fiddled' and none 
[normal]of this is a surprise. It is also clear that the resolution truly lies where it begins: in  the senior ranks. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12.[bold] Once again, 
[normal]I thank the Committee for their time in reading and their consideration of this written evidence, and I also welcome any questio
[normal]ns that the Committee may wish to ask. I am happy to be called before the Committee at their convenience.
