[[[Written evidence ]]]

[[[submitted by the RSPB]]]

[[[ ]]]The RSPB welcomes the opportunity to provide evidence to the Environmental Audit Committee inquiry into biodiversity offsetting. 

[[[Summary]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Introduction]]]1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The UK National Ecosystem Assessment provides a comprehensive account of how the natural environment and its biodiversity provide us with services that are critical to our wellbeing and economic prosperity. Despite this, biodiversity is being continually eroded and fragmented by inappropriate development. The planning system does not adequately guard against biodiversity loss; the mitigation hierarchy is inconsistently applied, and where compensation does take place it is often inadequate and short-lived. 2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; At the same time, there is an acute social need for more housing, alongside better infrastructure for business. Despite this, the planning system is often slow and cumbersome. It is, therefore, only right that Government explores ways in which to make the planning system more fit for purpose, so that it can deliver truly sustainable development. There is undoubtedly potential for a new system that could take a systematic account of the value of nature, save money for business, and increase speed in a simpler planning system. 3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; However, the Government’s preferred options raise a series of significant concerns that will need to be addressed before any new system is established.  In particular, offsetting must only be established as part of a coherent strengthening of the mitigation hierarchy; it must be supported by real, independent ecological expertise at a local level; it must be applied uniformly across developments; and it must be underpinned by a long-term financial and legal framework for monitoring, reporting and implementation. If this can be achieved, biodiversity offsetting can deliver potential benefits for economy, society and environment. Conversely, if these issues cannot be addressed, biodiversity offsetting risks serious damage to our natural environment.

[[[The m]]]

[[[itigation hierarchy ]]]4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Recreating complex natural processes is inherently difficult and full of risk. Essentially, you are guaranteeing ecological loss in return for uncertain gains. Even if the offset is successful, in many cases there will be a temporal loss of biodiversity that can never be retrieved. As such, in-situ conservation is always preferable. 5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; That offsetting biodiversity loss is incredibly difficult is evidenced by the fact that there are no systems in the world that have been able to demonstrate no net loss of biodiversity, and the wealth of studies showing (often considerable) net- losses. Indeed, we would seriously question the repeated statements in the Impact Assessment, that offsetting will ‘improve biodiversity’, given the absence of any evidence to support this statement.   6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is because of the uncertainty and risk associated with offsetting that the mitigation hierarchy must be adhered to, as required by the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). Offsetting should only ever be undertaken when a development is absolutely necessary, and all attempts to avoid harm or mitigate it have been exhausted. We welcome the statements in the Green Paper that the mitigation hierarchy is adhered to, but this assertion is undermined and contradicted by the explicit desire for offsetting to free up more land on site for development (because mitigation will no longer be necessary). This is a blatant disregard of the mitigation hierarchy, to which we strongly object.7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We would consider the failure of LPAs to avoid and mitigate harm from development to be a far more serious problem for biodiversity than the poor implementation of any necessary compensation. This is largely due to a culture of not valuing biodiversity and not giving due weight to policies concerned with biodiversity – a point supported by Defra commissioned research into the implementation of PPS9. Government must ensure that LPAs and the Planning Inspectorate give appropriate weight to biodiversity policies, just as they do to, for example, housing policies. 8.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; LPAs need better guidance on how to avoid and mitigate harm, and it is crucial that a single guidance document is published on every aspect of the mitigation hierarchy. This must contain very clear guidance on how to assess harm, avoid harm, mitigate harm, and finally – offset harm.

[[[cological expertise]]]

[[[ within planning authorities ]]]

[[[ ]]]9.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The metric applied to offsetting is merely a simple articulation of what will often be a complex decision. It takes significant ecological expertise to be able to assess the ‘value’ of a site and to understand how, or if, its loss can be compensated. Such an exercise will necessarily require a degree of judgement, and while it is the responsibility of the developer to provide the initial assessment, the LPA cannot fulfil its role as a competent decision-maker if it is unable to verify the information. 10.&#xa0;&#xa0; The world of land use planning is highly contested by a myriad of different interests, and the integrity of the planning system depends on independent arbitration. Moreover, the public’s faith in the system depends on independent arbitration. The decision to approve an application may hinge on matters relating to biodiversity and it would be unacceptable for a LPA to have to simply accept the developer’s recommendation on offsetting – even if the report is written by an ‘accredited’ expert. Accredited or otherwise, a consultant is ultimately being paid by a developer - who will have a clear vested interest in obtaining planning permission. We would strongly recommend a system of accreditation but this cannot be a substitute for LPA ecological expertise. Many planning consultants are ‘accredited’ by the Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI), but no-one would seriously suggest that this negates the need for local authority planning officers. It is equally unacceptable for LPAs not to have any ecological expertise, simply because consultants are accredited. 11.&#xa0;&#xa0; One of the potential benefits of an offsetting system would be the strategic choice of offset type and location, involving the replacement of lower value habitat with higher value habitats (higher value habitats should generally be replaced like for like). While certain habitats are of national importance (and this needs to be reflected in any metrics), ‘value’ will vary according to local ecological context. Ecological expertise is therefore needed to ensure that local metrics reflect local value, and strategic plans maximise opportunities for enhancing the local ecological network with offsets. 12.&#xa0;&#xa0; Given the critical importance of local authority ecological expertise in both reducing risk and maximising potential benefits associated with offsets, it is highly alarming that less than 30% of local authorities have any ecological expertise. All local authorities must have ready access to independent ecological expertise before a biodiversity offsetting system can be reliably implemented.   

[[[The importance of a]]]

[[[ mandatory ]]]

[[[system]]]13.&#xa0;&#xa0; Largely because it is required as part of an environmental impact assessment (EIA), there will generally be an explicit process of assessing the potential impacts of a major planning application on biodiversity. However, for applications that are either outside of protected areas or that fail to meet the required threshold for an EIA, biodiversity is infrequently considered and assessments of potential harm are often poor. This is a major factor in the alarming losses of wildlife outside of protected areas. Losses of biodiversity and the fragmentation of habitats outside of protected areas, also have a significant negative impact on our protected area network. 14.&#xa0;&#xa0; We share the Government’s desire for a faster and simpler planning system that brings forward the sustainable development that society needs. A faster system depends on increased simplicity, and the system will only become simpler for all users, if all users are using the same system. It is very difficult to reconcile the Government’s contradictory desire for a simple system, and for developers to be able to opt out and use a different system. A new method will only make the planning system simpler if everyone in the planning system uses it.15.&#xa0;&#xa0; Nor will a scheme deliver effective protection for biodiversity if a threshold is applied below which developers will not be required to participate. A standard and explicit system for assessing potential harm to biodiversity would  only bring marginal conservation benefits if solely applied to major developments; whereas there would be significant benefits if it was applied to all new housing development, new commercial buildings and to large commercial extensions. We recognise that direct participation in an offsetting scheme may be prohibitively expensive for some of the smallest developers—in such cases, it may be possible to implement a form of the Community Infrastructure Levy, where businesses would pay a levy to the local planning authority which would then strategically offset any unavoidable damage associated with the development.

[[[Metrics]]]16.&#xa0;&#xa0; There must be a consistent framework for local authorities to produce their own metrics within an offsetting supplementary planning document. This is because the value of a habitat may vary depending on context. For example, woodland may be extremely rare in an urban authority and this would need to be reflected in the ‘score’ used to express its value.17.&#xa0;&#xa0; There must also be national guidelines that set minimum scores for nationally important priority habitats and species, so that, for example, a local authority in Dorset could not set a low score for nationally rare heathland, on the basis that it is not considered rare in that district. 18.&#xa0;&#xa0; Species should also be included in any future metrics, and this needs to be accompanied by much better data on general populations, so that the value of a local population can be determined. Storing all data collected as part of a new standardised system, both for existing/ lost sites and for offsetting sites, could be hugely beneficial in this regard. This data should be stored nationally by Natural England, via LPAs. 

[[[Protection]]]

[[[ and management of offset sites ]]]19.&#xa0;&#xa0; For offsetting to stand any chance of avoiding net losses, sites must be protected and managed over ecologically relevant timeframes. 20.&#xa0;&#xa0; Natural processes require very large areas of natural land that are seldom found in England. Unfortunately, this renders most habitats in need of continual management and this would be the case for most offset sites, thus making ongoing management an additional cost on top of the upfront costs associated with creating the habitat. 21.&#xa0;&#xa0; Management costs must be secured if the offset site is to stand any chance of avoiding a net-loss of biodiversity. A recent example from Scotland, involving a European protected site and Scottish Coal, highlights the dangers: Scottish Coal were granted permission to mine, on the condition that they restore the site after use, only for Scottish coal to then declare bankruptcy. 22.&#xa0;&#xa0; In order to overcome the danger of either the developer or the offset provider ceasing to operate (there is a danger this could be premeditated) it is critically important that monies are collected prior to the commencement of development and this money is paid into a trust fund. We recommend that this trust fund is operated by one of Defra’s agencies – preferably Natural England. This would enable additional oversight and the ability to withhold funds if the offset provider was not meeting the conditions of their agreement. 

[[[Clear responsibility and the ability to enforce]]]23.&#xa0;&#xa0; Without clear legal and financial arrangements in place at the outset, there is no guarantee that an offsetting provision would be reliable. There must be a robust legal agreement that sets out clear responsibility for the implementation and management of an offset. Critically, this has to enable enforcement to be taken against a specified party at any time, for the duration of the agreement. In particular, it must also be possible to take punitive action against a third-party that fails to fulfil its obligations. As such, it is inconceivable that a third-party would not be bound by a legal agreement at the planning stage, as the delivery of the offset is integral to the decision to grant planning permission. It is, therefore, alarming that the Green Paper suggests that provision of an offset by a third-party could avoid the need for detailed requirements regarding compensatory measures in s106 or similar agreements. You cannot grant planning permission, subject to a legal agreement, if the legal agreement does not secure all of the measures necessary to make the development acceptable. 24.&#xa0;&#xa0; If the granting of planning permission is dependent on satisfactory offsetting, there must also be a clear legal responsibility on the competent authority to enforce the offset for the duration of the agreement, with this being the LPA in most cases. However, it may be advantageous from a conservation perspective for the offsetting to take place outside of the local authority where the development takes place and permission is granted. Clarification would be needed as to how enforcement action could be taken in such circumstances, if, for example, a management agreement was not being adhered to. 25.&#xa0;&#xa0; Furthermore, if commuted sums are taken by LPAs for smaller developments (to enable cumulative funding for strategic offsetting) in lieu of any offset provision, the monies must be ring-fenced and used for conservation, and there must be a robust legal agreement in place with the subsequent offset provider - that can be enforced through a civil mechanism. 

[[[Ensuring ]]]

[[[additionality]]]

[[[ ]]]26.&#xa0;&#xa0; Any offsetting provision must be additional to any existing statutory or policy obligations. For example, this means that it would not be acceptable for aftercare from a minerals site (that was a condition of the permission) to be used to offset harm from another development, as the aftercare was necessary to offset the harm from the mineral extraction. However, the aftercare agreement would typically be time limited, and in some circumstances we would be comfortable for the site to be sold as an offset once the planning obligation had expired, if this would secure additional funding necessary to manage the site. Likewise, it would be unacceptable for Government to generate funds needed to fulfil its existing obligations for managing protected sites through offsetting. Neither would it be acceptable to use agri-environment funded work to offset harm elsewhere, during the timeframe of the agreement. The integrity of the system depends on additionality and without additionality we will end up with severe net-losses of biodiversity. 27.&#xa0;&#xa0; It is also important to avoid offset provision being ‘double-sold’. This will require a central register, preferably maintained by Natural England, that holds details of all offset provision. 

[[[Monitoring]]]28.&#xa0;&#xa0; One of the main benefits of introducing a standard system is that it enables effective monitoring and analysis of net changes. This means that Natural England should be required to collect the data of the initial assessment of the site, in order to understand what has been lost. There must also be a legal agreement as part of the planning consent that requires the submission of monitoring reports of the offset to the LPA. These should also be standardised so that the assessments of the site follows the same criteria as those used when deciding whether or not to offset. This data should in turn be submitted to Natural England. Understanding changes in the extent of different habitats will also be necessary to inform the revision of criteria for valuing habitats, as value may change according to changes in extent.

[[[Offset type and location]]]

[[[ ]]]29.&#xa0;&#xa0; High value habitats must be protected accordingly. This means that permission should only be granted on sites that have a high ‘score’ in exceptional circumstances. The bar for what constitutes necessary development should rise commensurate with the score - and the likelihood of granting permission should decrease. Furthermore, if a high value habitat is lost, we would expect that habitat to be replaced like-for-like, wherever possible. 30.&#xa0;&#xa0; For sites with lower scores (especially smaller sites), offsetting with a higher value habitat in a strategic location could lead to significant ecological gains. In order to maximise this potential, neighbouring LPAs should work with each other and with their Local Nature Partnerships, to identify strategic locations where cumulative offsetting could do most to improve ecological connectivity and deliver landscape-scale conservation. This strategy should then be embedded in the LPAs SPD for offsetting.31.&#xa0;&#xa0;  However, while strategically locating offsets has the potential to deliver ecological gains, distancing communities from biodiversity can also incur a social cost.  For instance, taking a small wildlife reserve from an ecologically deprived location could have a significantly negative impact on that community’s quality of life.  LPAs will need to carefully balance the needs of people and wildlife, and these trade-offs should be explicitly addressed when planning for the strategic implementation of offsets. &#xa0;16 October 2013&#xa0; Watson and Albon, 2011, The UK National Ecosystem Assessment: Synthesis of Key Findings Over 40% of England’s priority species, 30% of priority habitats and 30% of ecosystem services are still declining, while eight priority species were lost entirely between 2002 and 2008.
