"BRC36\n&#xa0;\nSubmission from Safe Install Electrical Solutions&#xa0;My Background and my viewpoint of the industry as a whole\n&#xa0;\nI am 29 years old and after serving in the armed forces for five years with distinction I decided to leave and become an electrician. That was in 2006 and ever since then I\n have utilised my personal skill set and my armed forces experience to work towards the goal of  becoming a business leader and starting my own venture.\n&#xa0;\nI felt it very important that I first become an expert in my field. However I wasn't prepared for just\n how challenging becoming an electrical expert was. There are many specialisms in the electrical industry, technology is evolving rapidly and to gain experience in all of the specialisms is unrealistic.\n&#xa0;\nWhat I am saying is to become a highly competent ele\nctrician is no easy task. I am about to achieve my Joint Industry Board Technician Status having sat my level 4 design qualification. (I studied very hard and believe I have passed the exam) \n&#xa0;\nI now have nearly eight years experience in the industry. I hav\ne worked in the Nuclear and Solar industry as well as for companies such as National Grid, EDFE, Western Power and having worked on a whole range of projects from swimming pools, ASDA superstores, Nuclear Power plants and High Voltage Earthing. It has take\nn eight years but only now would I feel any truth in saying, “I am highly competent.”\n&#xa0;\nYet to become a member of these Part P scheme providers you only have to achieve your 17\nth\n Edition exam and pass two installation inspections. If you look on the various\n forums around the internet, the forums are loaded with people who have just passed their 17\nth\n edition exam and are now looking to be told how to carry out two installs to pass the Part P compliance inspections from the NICEIC or Elecsa etc etc.\n&#xa0;\nIn my vie\nw Part P is self defeating. It does absolutely nothing to improve electrical safety. \n&#xa0;\nLet’s\n look at a few other major problems.\n&#xa0;\nFirstly, when a job has been completed that is required to be notified under the part p scheme, the only details required are t\nhe name and address of the customer as well as sticking a check box to indicate what type of work was carried out.\n&#xa0;\nSo what we are allowing is under qualified people to carry out electrical design, installation and testing and then require no design or tes\nting parameters to be submitted for scrutiny by someone who does possess the required competence.\n&#xa0;\nIn fact, Part P seems to be more of a licence for people who have no competence to easily gain accreditation and carry out dangerous and shoddy work legally.\n \n&#xa0;\nWe have licensed the cowboys.\n&#xa0;\nThere is a vicious cycle out there right now. That vicious cycle goes as follows:\nGovernment creates legal licence for cowboys to operate\n&#xa0;\nCowboy meets potential victim and does not have the design knowledge to price the \njob correctly to achieve a safe, compliant installation\n&#xa0;\nCustomer decides to buy on price\n&#xa0;\nElectrician makes light bulb work\n&#xa0;\nCustomer has no idea electrician has installed a potential fire risk due to incorrect design\n&#xa0;\nCustomer has no idea metal light fit\nting has not been\n earthed or the modified circuit does not meet other requirements such as disconnection times in the event of a fault\n&#xa0;\nElectrician is not required to submit design details\n&#xa0;\nProblem remains until either house burns down, house is sold and te\nsted or customer is killed\n&#xa0;\nHighly competent electrician who priced the job correctly looses business and eventually goes bust or moves in to employment\n&#xa0;\nGeneral public are left with a mass of cowboys ready to serve with few quality electricians left\n&#xa0;\nI w\nould invite anyone of the committee to come and work with me for a two month period to experience firsthand\n the effect this has on people’s\n lives and the dangers out there that exist.\n&#xa0;\nYou only have to look at the statistics for death, injury and fires cau\nsed by electricity. I believe that if the system continues as it is these statistics will rise \n&#xa0;\nThe biggest flaw of all is the fact that there is no mechanism to ensure that work is carried out properly. Time and time again I work for people who have jus\nt bought a house. I test and inspect the house and find significant problems.\n&#xa0;\nThere are too many vested interests and mortgage companies and estate agents are two massive culprits in my view.\n&#xa0;\nI believe that there shouyld be a mechanism where before any \nhouse is sold, an independent third party electrical inspector should inspect the property and any defects taken off the price of the house.\n&#xa0;\nDIY home owners are getting away with carrying out dangerous electrical work on a massive scale. The problem is ex\nacerbated by incompetent electricians, desperate for money who will then come in and sign off the work. Sometimes knowingly sometimes through sheer incompetence.\n&#xa0;\nI want to share one last story with you.\n&#xa0;\nI was recently tasked with solving a customer’s\n elec\ntrical problem. The problem was the young couple were experiencing blown light bulbs, up to 2 a day at times.\n&#xa0;\nWhat I found was a trail of destruction. I believe what happened there (after speaking with the next door neighbour) was the home owner rewired t\nhe house himself.\n&#xa0;\nThis couple bought the house and thought the house wiring was fine because they had a Part P compliance certificate. Unfortunately a Napit engineer who had installed the consumer unit was clearly incompetent. I took one look at the test \nresults and could not understand some of the data he had recorded.\n&#xa0;\nHe had not carried out any proper testing or inspection, in fact\n I believe he made the results up. There was no earthing on any of the Class 1 metal light fittings. What the previous owner \nhad done was just unbelievable. There were bundles of wires which when I started to inspect, had conductors falling out of connector blocks. Not a single earth cable was sleeved\n or connected to the metal light fittings.\n&#xa0;\nThis was just the tip of the iceber\ng there and since starting my business two years ago, I am appalled at how weak the industry is in terms of ensuring a robust framework which sets out to increase electrical safety and promote the electrical industry in a positive way.\n&#xa0;\nThis is just the mo\nst recent case and certainly not an isolated case. In fact I believe that as little as 10% or less of electrical installation work is compliant. And don’t think new houses are any different. I have worked on brand new houses with problems.\n&#xa0;\nWe are not Pain\nters and Decorators, we are not carpenters. Electricians should be highly skilled and competent people entrusted to deliver safe and robust installations.\n&#xa0;\nIn terms of people being aware of Part P and what it’s\n there for, I’d\n say less than 2% of people\n understand Part P with probably around 60% falling in to the I need\n a certificate\n category and the remainder just either not caring or knowing.\n&#xa0;\nI would also like to touch on another factor since you are also looking to understand the competence of the in\ndustry as a whole.\n&#xa0;\nLet’s\n take the ECS scheme. Sounds great right? I am an approved electrician with the JIB and have an ECS card which states my grading as an approved electrician.\n&#xa0;\nThis surely means I am competent? \n&#xa0;\nWrong. The JIB takes no account of \nexperience and most importantly, your personal skill set.\n&#xa0;\nI have met plenty of JIB approved electricians who don’t understand basic electrical principles.\n&#xa0;\nMoving away from the Part P scheme I'd also say that recruitment agencies and employers use the JIB\n/ECS card scheme exclusively to evaluate ones competence to do the job.\n&#xa0;\nUseless. But then in an industry that is riddled with incompetence what else can we expect?\n&#xa0;\nThis industry has incompetent leaders and no back bone or frame work to really create an e\nnvironment of excellence. I hope you can take a long hard look\n at things and come up with some positive changes but I won't be expecting any radical changes because in my view this country’s\n leaders as a whole are weak and incompetent and that just feeds d\nown through the entire system.\n&#xa0;\nGood Luck!\n&#xa0;\n3 December 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
