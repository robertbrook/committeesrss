[[[What should the BBC be ]]]

[[[for and what should be the purpose of public service broadcasting?]]] &#xa0;I would like to see the role of the BBC minimised and radically reformed to produce, without bias nor fear and favour, only news and current affairs, combined with information representing the UK, its nations, regions and communities and bringing the UK to the world and the world to the UK.   My reasons:&#xa0;a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The landscape has changed in this digital age since the BBC has now become one of a multitude of other media outlets that can be chosen, including free, online and subscription options.b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A radically reformed and minimised BBC would avoid the numerous taxpayer abuses e.g.

[[[(1)  Financial ineptitude]]]:(i)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Gigantic waste on failed IT scheme.(ii)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Lonely Planet purchase.(iii)&#xa0;&#xa0; Enormous Staff Pay-offs.(iv)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Tax avoidance staff schemes.(v)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Move to Salford(vi)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Unbelievable high management salaries.(vii)&#xa0; Staff perks etc, etc, etc etc,.................... &#xa0;

[[[(2)   ]]]

[[[Immoral appeasement]]] of criminal behaviour and cover ups like Saville and many other scandals.

[[[(3)   Privatis]]]

[[[ation of]]] the successful commercial broadcasting parts of the BBC would relieve the enormous mandatory tax price to the viewer, who can then choose to subscribe.  I believe the TV Licence can no longer be justified for the following reasons:(i)   There is an increasing avoidance and loathing of paying the enormous TV Licence Fee by:d.      A large proportion of UK residents, feel the BBC is alien to their views, (mainly those that do not vote Labour, feel the BBC has a left slant and bias on EU, immigration, climate change, politics and religious affairs).  &#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
