[[[Introduction ]]]Dangerous in practice Wrong in principleThe claimed savings are unrealistic The alternative options are ineffective Reduced availability of advice generally &#xa0;Particular impact on people with mental health problems and learning disabilitiesParticular impact on womenNo adequate justification“Every person within the jurisdiction enjoys the equal protection of our laws. There is no distinction between British nationals and others. He who is subject to English law is entitled to its protection. This principle has been in the law at least since Lord Mansfied freed “the black” in Somerset’s Case (1772) 20 St.Tr.1” Legal Aid eligibility is based on this very principle: it is currently available for all, regardless of their country of residence, provided their case raises an issue in the legal system of England and Wales and comes within the narrow scope of Legal Aid. This is the ‘connection’ necessary and appropriate for eligibility; having a dispute of substance which needs to be resolved in our Courts which cannot otherwise be funded. It is fair, sensible and easy to police. It has always been a feature of the Legal Aid system. or they must show that they benefit from an exemption because they are: An unworkable test In this one year alone, each of these 729,483 acts of assistance would have needed to be preceded by a residence test administered by solicitors and audited by the Legal Aid Agency. Strikingly, these statistics do not feature in the proposals at all. The scale of the practical problems the test will create is, apparently, considered to be irrelevant by the MoJ. “The specific evidence requirements have not yet been decided upon. However, individuals who do not already have evidence of UK nationality may have to pay a fee for a copy of their birth certificate or other documentation if they do not have easy access to them. Claimants may also experience a delay in their cases whilst documentation is sought.” The residence test in practice: international family cases  “What I find so depressing is that the case highlights the difficulties increasingly encountered by the judiciary at all levels when dealing with litigants in person. Two problems in particular are revealed. The first is how to bring order to the chaos which litigants in person invariably – and wholly understandably – manage to create in putting forward their claims and defences. Judges should not have to micro-manage cases, coaxing and cajoling the parties to focus on the issues that need to be resolved. Judge Thornton did a brilliant job in that regard yet, as this case shows, that can be disproportionately time-consuming. It may be saving the Legal Services Commission which no longer offers Legal Aid for this kind of litigation but saving expenditure in one public department in this instance simply increases it in the courts. The expense of three judges of the Court of Appeal dealing with this kind of appeal is enormous. The consequences by way of delay of other appeals which need to be heard are unquantifiable. The appeal would certainly never have occurred if the litigants had been represented.

[[[ ]]]With more and more self-represented litigants, this problem is not going to go away. We may have to accept that we live in austere times, but as I come to the end of eighteen years service in this court, I shall not refrain from expressing my conviction that justice will be ill served indeed by this emasculation of Legal Aid” (emphasis added)The residence test in practice: victims of crime, abuse and wrongdoing “proper protection and support for victims of crime is a fundamental part of a civilised justice system. and committed itself to “action” to “ensure that victims get the support they need to cope with the aftermath”. But, despite improvements over the last two decades, the system has continued to fall short in helping victims recover from crime, supporting them through the stresses of investigation and trial, and providing the right support at the right time.The residence test in practice: other civil cases  Discrimination Absence of justification “3.42 We are concerned that individuals with little or no connection to this country are currently able to claim Legal Aid to bring civil legal actions at UK taxpayers’ expense. These may be people who have never set foot in England or Wales, or those who have never paid taxes in the UK, but who are yet able to benefit financially from the civil Legal Aid scheme. Alternatively these may be people who are in the country but whose connection is tenuous because they are simply here on a visa as visitors, or because they have temporary admission. 3.43 We need to introduce a common sense test to address this anomalous situation, which we believe is currently unfair to the UK taxpayer. We believe that limited public funds for civil Legal Aid should be targeted at those who have a strong connection to the UK.”and secondly to deter ‘forum shopping’: “3.44 We are also concerned that the availability of Legal Aid for cases brought in this country, irrespective of the person’s connection with this country, may encourage people to bring disputes here.”  Proportionality &#xa0;&#xa0;Incomplete data and flawed assumptions The proposal is wholly impractical  Wrong in principle  Practical implications Eliminating funding for genuine test cases is wrong in principleImpact of the proposal, if implemented

[[[Conclusion ]]]27 September 2013&#xa0; These are summarised in an article by Mike Schwarcz and John Halford of this firm: http://www.solicitorsjournal.com/comment/legal-aid-cuts-more-detail-more-devils  http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/features/interview-chris-grayling R v. Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Khawaja [1984] AC74 at 111Ghttp://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20091009075030/http://www.justice.gov.uk/consultations/legal-aid-refocusing-priority-cases.htm The abandoned 2008 residence test would not have excluded EU nationals from accessing legal aid (regardless of where they are resident) or others covered by reciprocal arrangements. It would not have affected cases concerning immigration issues (about entry or terms of stay), nor the detention of any client under the Mental Heath Act 1983, nor childcare or supervision proceedings under the Children Act 1989, nor child abduction proceedings covered by the Hague Convention, nor domestic violence proceedings, and nor would it cover housing proceedings where the client was at risk of homelessness. The 2008 consultation paper accepted, without much elaboration, that it would not be ‘appropriate’ to leave work of this kind unfunded. http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/corporate-reports/legal-services-commission  https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/helping-and-supporting-victims-of-crime See Article 2, and CEDAW General Recommendation 28, Paras. 32,34,36; HRC General Comment No. 31, Paras. 15-20.
