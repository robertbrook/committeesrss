"&#xa0;\nSubmission by The Captive Animals’ Protection Society, UKExecutive SummaryThe EFRA Committee has asked for evidence regarding three specific points of interest, as follows:\nThis submission seeks to provide \ncomment\n with \nregard to the second and third points only as our organisation does not hold information on \nthe extent of the trade\n in primates as pets in the UK. It is, however, \nunderstood that evidence with regard to the extent of the trade will be submitted by other re\nspondents to this i\nnquiry.\nOur organisation strongly advocates a complete ban on the trade in, and keeping of, non-human primates privately based on the firm belief that the complex welfare needs of non-human primates cannot be met in private hands.\nAbout the Captive Animals’ Protection Society: Founded in 1957, the Captive Animals’ Protection Society (CAPS) is one of the UK’s longest-running charities working to protect animals. Working alongside campaign partners, CAPS has supported the call for a ban on \nthe keeping of primates as pets for a number of years. Members of the CAPS team have long-term experience working with rescued primates as well as with primate conservation organisations worldwide.\nEvidence to support a ban on the trade in, and keeping of, non-human primates privatelyOur organisation \nmaintains\n that:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIn light of all of the above, we believe that the \ntrade in, and \nkeeping of\n,\n primates privately must be prohibited. It is recognised that this prohibition might be introduced using a number of different mechanisms, which would need to be considered upon their own merits in due course. \nWhilst \nit is recognised that some private kee\npers may differentiate themselves from \n“\npet owners\n”\n by virtue of their experi\nence in keeping these animals, w\ne reject any suggestion that exceptions should be made for those keepers\n in the case that prohibition is brought forward. This assertion is made\n on\n the basis that, if primates are inherently unsuited to being kept privately, the experience of the keepers in question is irrelevant. \nGiven that there are estimated to be between \n3,006 to 9,017\n \nprimates held in private hands at present\n, it is \naccepted\n that a \n“\ngrandfather clause\n”\n may be necessary\n in the case that any prohibition is brought forward\n. This may be necessary in order to \naccommodate those who keep primates privately in standards that are currently deemed to be acceptable in law so as to avoid\n criminalising the operation \nof \nlegitimate sanctuaries, seeing licensed zoos being inundated with primates or seeing individual primates euthanized in large numbers.\n The way in which any grandfather clause might operate, much like the mechanism for introdu\ncing any ban, is something which should be considered on its merits in due course.\nIt is recognised that the introduction on a ban on the keeping of primates privately will present some obstacles and complications but \nwe firmly believe \nthat this should not\n be used as a reason to take no action on this matter. \nThe UK prides itself on being a nation of animal love\nrs but\n continuing to allow the keeping \nof \nanimals with such complex physical, social, emotional and behavioural needs in private hands \nis to underm\nine our reputation as a leader in animal welfare protection. \nFinally, it should be recognised that there are a number of expert organisations in the UK which are willing and able to work with Government in the development and delivery of any ban in the in\nterests of reaching the best possible outcome for the animals involved.\nJanuary 2014 \n&#xa0;\n ICM Research 2013\n (Documentation available upon request)\n RSPCA 2013\n (\nhttp://www.rspca.org.uk/allaboutanimals/pets/other/primates\n)\n \n"
