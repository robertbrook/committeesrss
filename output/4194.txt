&#xa0;Written evidence from the Sevenoaks Cycle Forum (CYS0088)&#xa0;Debate continues to be based on the widely shared but erroneous assumption that road safety is accurately defined by crash and casualty statistics.  During its 2012 inquiry your committee notably failed to ask the basic question ‘What is road safety and how should it be measured?’ The current inquiry should make amends by revisiting this question and should make clear that road safety includes much more than just casualty reduction.   The exclusive reliance on Stats19 data to measure safety for cyclists and pedestrians is flawed for at least three reasons: a) it leads to an assumption that an absence of crashes and casualties on a particular road means that road is ‘safe’, when in fact it is often so unsafe that pedestrians and cyclists are forced to avoid it. b) crashes involving cyclists are often under-reported c) annual reductions in overall KSI figures owe more to improved NHS casualty treatment and better vehicle design to protect motorists than to real improvements in road safety  for vulnerable users.  Road safety is a complex area of social policy, like public health, child protection or community safety, but the conventional wisdom among road safety professionals does not reflect this.  Nobody would measure public health outcomes by looking solely at statistics for acute episodes such as heart attacks and strokes.  Nobody would measure crime by looking solely at murders and serious assaults. Nobody would measure child welfare by counting only children who are taken to hospital. But road safety is still measured solely by looking at KSI statistics.  The DfT should copy the Home Office which supplements police statistics of recorded crime by publishing the British Crime Survey.  A British Road Safety Survey using opinion sampling would be an overdue innovation and your committee should recommend it.  It is not enough just to tell people that cycling is statistically safe; for inexperienced cyclists and potential cyclists, an individual risk assessment based on their own perceptions is what counts. This is particularly important when parents are deciding whether or not to let their children ride bikes on the road.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;I think these recommendations would help give your report a broader national perspective on the issue of cycle safety outside major cities.  That is not to say that the issues emerging from the London debate (HGV safety, segregation, cycle training and redesign of junctions) are not also relevant in rural and suburban areas.  We would just like a tiny fraction of the attention (and the generous funding) which is being directed towards cycle safety in London to be channelled in our direction as well.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
