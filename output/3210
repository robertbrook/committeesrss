Written evidence submitted by The Community Woodlands Association (CWA)default&#xa0;
defaultThe Community Woodlands Association
default (CWA) is very pleased to have the opportunity to submit a response to the open consultation on land reform in Scotland launched by the Scottish Affairs 
defaultCommittee in July 201
default3.
default We fully endorse the paper the Committee published to stimulate discussion “432
default:50 – toward a comprehensive land reform agenda” which 
defaultpresent
defaults a
defaultn excellent 
defaultsummary of the issues around land reform in Scotland.
default&#xa0;
defaultCWA was established in 2003 as the direct representative body of Scotland’s community woodland groups. We help community woodland groups across the country achieve their aspirations and potential, providing advice, assistance and information, facilitating 
defaultnetworking and training, and representing and promoting community woodlands to the wider world. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe first community land buyout in Scotland was at 
defaultWooplaw
default Community Woodland in the Borders (1987), and there are now well over 200 community woodland groups
default across Scotland, responsible for the management of tens of thousands of hectares of woodland and open space.
default 
defaultMore than half of our members own their woods, the remainder lease or work in partnership with public and private sector landowners.
default 
defaultCommunity w
defaultoodlands are extremely diverse, embracing all woodland types from ancient semi-natural woods to extensive conifer plantations, and ranging from less than a hectare to 
defaultover a thousand hectares in size
default.
default 
defaultLikewise, the communities involved range from 
defaultcrofting
default townships in the far north and west to small towns and inner-city communities in the central belt.
defaultSome of the larger groups employ staff to manage and develop their woods, while others are managed entirely by volunteers.
default 
defaultWhilst the aims and objectives 
defaultof individual groups vary according to local needs and aspirations, and the type and scale of the woodland managed, all are working to build sustainable, flourishing, creative, resilient and vibrant communities.
default 
defaultScotland’s community woodlands deliver a hu
defaultge range of public benefits, 
defaultacross a suite of policy agendas, 
defaultincluding:
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the past decade we have supported a great many of our member
default groups
default in their attempts to acquire land
default, from private and publi
defaultc sector
default landowners.
default 
defaultSome are successful; 
defaultalmost all discover that the process of 
defaultacquisition 
defaultis onerous, bureaucratic and long-winded.
default 
defaultIssues around valuation and financing have proved particularly difficult, in part at least as a consequence of the dis
defaulttorted market in and inflated price of land caused by the favourable tax and subsidy regime for landowners.
defaultResponses to Specific Questionsdefault&#xa0;defaultWe 
defaulthave provided brief answers to 
defaulta number of questions, as below, and have attached, as annexes, three papers pro
defaultviding more detail on 
defaultthe specific aspects of the difficulties facing community bodies seeking to acquire assets, especially woodland
default.
default&#xa0;
default1default              defaultHow does Scotland compare to other countries in terms of the pattern of land ownership?defaultOfficial
default statistics on land own
defaultership
default are conspicuous in their 
defaultabsence;
default however, there is a substantial body of academic research demonstrating that land ownership in Scotland is concentrated in very few hands, compared to our European 
defaultneighbors
default.
default 
defaultIn 2011, the Forestry Policy Group, of
default which CWA is a member, commissioned research
default on forest ownership in Scotland. This demonstrated that 
defaultthat of the 67% of Scotland’s fores
defaultt area that is privately owned, 91%
default is owned either by landed e
defaultstates or by investment owners, with 55% of the area ow
defaultned by absentees.
default 
default&#xa0;
default2default              defaultWhat are the benefits and disadvantages of the current pattern of land ownership, and to what extent is this pattern sustained and reinforced by subsidy and taxation arrangements?defaultThe current ownership pattern 
defaultconcentrates
default decision
default-
defaultma
defaultking in the hands of relativel
defaulty few 
defaultindividuals, a significant proportion of whom are disengaged from the consequences of their decisions: either wealthy enough to pursue their whims or simply uninterested in the land other than as an investment vehicle.
default 
defaultAt the same time the vast majority of those living and working in rural Scotland are effectively disenfranchised.
default 
defaultThis does not seem to be a sound basis for sustainable land management. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe land-ownership pattern is sustained and reinforced by subsidy and taxation arrangements in 
defaulta number of
default ways:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3default              defaultIs the current system of land tenure in Scotland the most efficient model for food defaultsecurity?defaultNo
default&#xa0;
defaultFood security is an important strategic issue for all governments to consider
default, but the debate nee
defaultds to be grounded in the realities of current and feasible agricultural production in Scotland.
default 
defaultUnfortunately t
defaulthe food security 
default“
defaultdebate
default”
default has been
default largely hijacked
default by vested interests
default 
defaultand presented 
defaultas a justification for continued or increased levels of 
defaultpublic 
defaultsubsidy
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs will b
defaulte discussed, much of Scotland’s land is owned and valued for non-productive 
defaultpurposes
default: it seems improbable therefore 
defaultthat 
defaultth
defaultis w
defaultill
default deliver an efficient model for production.
default&#xa0;
default4default              defaultIn particular, is the current land ownership pattern contributing to, or inhibiting, economic and community development? Is it socially just? defaultThere is a widespread consensus, reflected in the Scottish 
defaultGovernment’s Land Use strategy, that the current ownership arrangements are not delivering sustainable development and the broad range of desired social, economic and environmental benefits.
defaultWe believe that the current land-ownership pattern inhibits econo
defaultmic and commun
defaultity development. In many cases 
defaultc
defaultcommunity
default ownership of forests, land and other assets is motivated by a desire to turn round economic fortunes and bring about greater economic and community development.
default&#xa0;
default5default              defaultGiven mounting political interest in,default or commitment to, a programme of land reform in Scotland, what form should this programme take?defaultWe have identified 5 key elements
default of a successful land reform programme
default:
default&#xa0;
defaultInformation
default:
default d
defaultetailed
default information on ownership patterns, 
defaultcovering both 
defaultprivate and pub
defaultlic sector, 
defaultshould be collated and made
default freely available. Summary management / development plans for all holdings above a 
defaultgiven 
defaultthreshold should also be publicly available
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultLegislation
default:
default 
defaulta legal framework 
defaultis required 
defaultwhich further empowers communities with 
defaultappropriate rights to purchase when that is in the public interest and even where there may not be a willing seller
default&#xa0;
defaultResourcing
default:
default a far-reaching and systemic re-evaluation and re-alignment of taxpayer support for rural land ownership is required, with an 
defaulteth
defaultos
default on buying public benefits
default with public money
default, and incorporating significant commitments to support community ownership and management of land and assets.
default&#xa0;
defaultPromotion
default:
default 
defaulta
default Land Agency body is required to champion and promote the Land Reform Act and the wider 
defaultLand Reform agenda. (see 9 below for more detail)
default&#xa0;
defaultCommitment:
default 
defaultthe 
defaultLand Reform 
defaultagenda must
default be embraced and proactively supported at all levels of 
defaultG
defaultove
defaultrnment, with a commitment to change and the willpower to find
default solutions to issues, rather than 
defaultlooking for
default 
defaultreasons to block
default community proposals
default (see comments on State Aid)
default.
default&#xa0;
default6default              defaultWhat sort of subsidies and grants are available to landed estate owners in Scotland? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the subsidy regime? In particular, are support payments defaultbeing capitalized into land values and making these higher than they otherwise would be?defaultLanded estate owners have access to a wide range of subsidies and grants, both directly as payments made through the Common Agricultural Policy or indirectly as benefi
defaultciaries of subsidised fuel or state sponsored research.
default 
defaultAdditionally, landowners can profit from development opportunities, e.g. the current 
defaultrenewables
default boom, itself largely driven by government support.
default&#xa0;
defaultSome grants and subsidies particularly those designe
defaultd to “buy” public benefits for the nation, are available to all landowners, and we have no objection to private landowners receiving public funding to deliver such benefits (e.g. provision of recreation, conservation of cultural heritage, enhancement of bi
defaultodiversity), however this is a 
defaultrelatively 
defaultsmall 
defaultproportion
default of the total flow from taxpayer to private landowners.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe largest single component of taxpayer funding comes in the form of Single Farm Payments, decoupled from production, and based on historic “
defaultentitlement
defaults
default”.
default These entitlements can be traded separately from the land to which they originally related, and continue to be payable even after abandonment of farming: it seems inconceivable 
defaultto 
defaultconsider that the capitalisation of support payments does not
default contribute significantly to the on-going uplift in land values.
default&#xa0;default7default              defaultHow does the tax regime affect the way in which land is owned in Scotland? For instance, does it offer landed estate owners the opportunity to minimize the tax they pay, thereby increasingdefault the value of land, adding to speculative interest (on the part of those looking for ways to minimize or avoid tax) and making it less likely that it will be made available to others?defaultWe believe
default that the favourable tax regime for private landownership in S
defaultcotland
default significantly affects patterns of ownership.
default 
defaultThe e
defaultxistence of a significant 
defaultland 
defaultand business 
defaultmanagement 
defaultindustry
default focused on supporting
default private owners to minimis
defaulte tax liabilities, while maxim
defaulti
defaults
defaulting 
defaultgrants and subsidies from public funds, is 
defaultcompelling evidence of the role that the tax regime plays, and of its
default contribut
defaultion
default to 
defaultinflating 
defaultland
default values.
default&#xa0;
default8default              defaultHow easy is it for communities in Scotland to take ownership of land and other assets? Should it be made easier in the light of the substantial defaultachievements of existing community ownership groups?defaultCWA and others have provided substantial evidence to the Land Reform Review Group
default which set out a wide range of ways in which the process of achieving more community ownership could be made easier. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOur
default experience in supporting Community woodland groups suggests that despite the long and successful track record of established community woodlands e.g. at 
defaultWooplaw
default (1987) and 
defaultAbriachan
default (1996), the process of acquiring woodlands has got more protracted and 
defaultproblematic over time, rather than easier.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn part this is because f
defaultunding has becomes scarcer and more tight
defaultly
default regulated
default (see later comments on state aid 
defaultetc.
default). It is also a consequence of i
defaultncreased regulatory scrutiny as elements of government seek to pr
defaultogressively define
default and constrain community organis
defaultations: 
defaultit is 
defaultclear
default that most of the pioneering (and 
defaultnow 
defaultsuccessful) community land or woodland buyouts would not be possible under current rules.
default&#xa0;default9default              defaultIs there a case for establishing a Land Agency to defaultfacilitate both the expansion of community ownership and the creation of new, especially “starter”, tenancies on land acquired for this purpose?defaultYes
default&#xa0;
defaultWe believe a new Land Agency body is required to champion and promote the Land Reform Act and the wider Lan
defaultd Reform agenda. This Land Agency would assist and advise communities on the registration and acquisition processes, work with community bodies and land owners to manage negotiations and facilitate transfers, and advise ministers on issues of public intere
defaultst and sustainable development.
default&#xa0;
default Such a body would require a range of powers, including those to compel co-operation from landowners and community bodies, and to carry out compulsory purchases and subsequent transfers to communities.
default 
defaultThe new Land Agency 
defaultcould be developed from existing public bodies, or created new. Either way, it should seek to utilise the considerable existing expertise within both t
defaulthe public and community sectors
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultStarter tenancies should include woodland crofts and smallholdings. 
defaultWe 
defaultnote
default that Forestry Commission Scotland has recently created starter farms on newly acquired land, but has declined to facilitate the creation of new woodland crofts on the National Forest Estate.
default&#xa0;
default10default              defaultHow easy is it for land in public ownership to be defaulttransferred to communities and other private individuals, where that would be in the public interest? Should steps be taken to make it easier? For instance, should the UK and Scottish Governments compile a register showing land and assets for disposal? Shodefaultuld there be changes in the way in which such land and assets are valued? What UK Treasury rules are relevant to this area?defaultCommunity woodlands have been at the forefront of community land and asset ownership, and over 100 woods of all types and sizes are 
defaultnow in community ownership
default. Despite this, 
defaulttransfers remain problematic
default, with the primary difficulties cent
defaultred
default 
defaulton
default financing and valuation.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn 2005 Forestry Commission Scotland (FCS) established the National Forest Land Scheme as a mechanism to facilitate co
defaultmmunity acquisition of assets. The scheme has much to recommend it, and it has been responsible for considerably more community acquisitions than the much more vaunted Community Right to Buy pr
defaultovisions of the Land Reform Act.
default&#xa0;
defaultH
defaultowever the operation of the N
defaultFLS
default has been increasingly 
defaultinhibit
defaulted by 
defaultfinancial issues. Essentially communities have found themselves caught between FCS, who insist that 
defaultthe Scottish Public Finance Manual
default demand
defaults
default that transactions are at full market value, and the Big Lottery
default Fund
default/Highl
defaultands &amp; Islands Enterprise, who have argued first that they cannot fund the acquisition of assets from the public sector, and then that any such state funding is constrained by state aid rules and limited to 20% of the purchase price.
default 
defaultFurther details of NF
defaultLS valuation issues are contained in Annexes 1 &amp; 2.
default&#xa0;
defaultT
defaulthe transfer of 
defaultpublic sector assets 
defaultwould be 
defaultfacili
defaultt
defaultated
default by 
defaultprovision of 
defaultpublicly available 
defaultasset 
defaultregisters, 
defaultand the replication of the
default National Forest Land Scheme 
defaultacross the public sector, and we believe these should be duties 
defaultplaced on each public authority.
default 
defaultHowever, these measures will 
defaultnot in themselves deliver substantial change
defaults
default in ownership 
defaultpatterns
default unless
default the issues over financing are resolved.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe do not beli
defaulteve that Treasury rules 
defaultneed 
defaultnecessarily 
defaultlim
defaultit the ability to transfer land, h
defaultowever
default,
default the discretion 
defaultpermitted
default 
defaultwithin the rules 
defaultis not clearly understood 
defaultthroughout Government, and this 
defaultmilitates against that discretion being used. 
defaultLikewise, there is a pre
defaultssing need to reconsider the principles of valuation, especially as the price that communities are expected to pay for assets is often unrelated to their productive value. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOften the assets that commun
defaulti
defaultties are seeking to acquire are more correctly 
defaultdescribed as liabilities, which the communities are taking on to rescue them from neglect or prevent closure of services and loss of amenity. Nonetheless, the asking price is usually inflated by some or all of the elements desc
defaultribed previou
defaultsly which are ir
defaultrelevant to
default public sector or community owners.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere
default is a
defaultlso a
default pressing need to clarify state aid rules
default, which are currently being used to 
defaultimpede
default community 
defaultasset 
defaultpurchases
default, particularly of woodlands.
default 
defaultCivil servants and local government officers need to be
default empowered to make appropriate appraisals of projects based on a thorough understanding of the regulations and a realistic view of the likelihood of challenge.
default 
defaultA more thorough-going solution is to develop approved schemes for the activities of community b
defaultased, non-profit distributing organisations, and to ensure that where possible they are covered by General Block Exemptions.
default 
defaultFurther details of the difficulties around state aids are contained in Annexe 3.
default&#xa0;
defaultAnnex 1default: 
defaultValuation fordefault 
defaultNFLS community acquisidefaulttion:defaultThe National Forest Land Scheme (NFLS) was introduced in 2005 by Forestry Commission Scotland to give community organisations, recognised non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and appropriate housing bodies the opportunity to buy or lease National F
defaultorest Land where they can provide increased public benefits.
default 
defaultCommunity bodies must be appropriately constituted, and demonstrate that their proposals for management are consistent with sustainable development principles, are in the public interest and wil
defaultl deliver additional public benefits cf. FES management.
default&#xa0;
defaultNotwithstanding the commitment to additional public benefit and the general alignment with the delivery of Scottish Government policy, acquisitions through the 
defaultNFLS 
defaultare required to be at
default “full market value”
default, and this has proved a significant obstacle to the effectiveness of the scheme.
default 
defaultValuations are carried out, on a joint instruction basis, by the District 
defaultValuer
default, who may receive representations from both FCs and the community body, an
defaultd then values the property on the basis of direct comparables.
default 
defaultBecause public assets are valued by comparison with private sector sales public
default bodies such 
defaultas Forestry Commission Scotland, who are 
defaultnot direct recipients of single farm payment 
defaultor 
defaulttax advanta
defaultges, 
defaultwill still benefit from any uplift
default in land prices.
default&#xa0;
defaultA significant proportion of community acquisitions have been stimulated by FCS’s on-going disposals policy, under which communities have a time-limited opportunity to attempt to acquire properties det
defaultermined by FCS to be surplus to requirements
default before they are placed on the open market.
default 
defaultFor most communities this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to gain control of key local assets and resources and manage them for local benefit. Once the woodland
defaults are sold into the private sector then the community has very little power to influence management objectives, or even to ensure that management takes place at all, and very little prospect of future acquisition: the Community Right to Buy provisions in t
defaulthe Land Reform Scotland Act are cumbersome, toothless and easily sidestepped by landowners.
default&#xa0;
defaultUnfortunately, the disposals policy has coincided with a period of rapid inflation in the price of forest land.
default 
defaultAs one DV report notes:
default&#xa0;
defaultSince 2008 there has been 
defaulta general downturn in the property market as a whole. However
default, l
defaultand and especially forestry properties have bucked the overall trend and have continued to increase in value throughout the period.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis inflationary trend, and the extent to which land price
default is driven by non-productive values
default,
default ha
defaults been illustrated by several recent NFLS valuations.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Ross of Mull and Iona Development Group have applied to acquire 
defaultTioran
default forest on the Isle of Mull. All parties have acknowledged that there are significant ob
defaultstacles to future forest management: notably 
defaultdisease, 
defaultwindblow
default, 
defaultand limited 
defaulttransport
default infrastructure. Nonetheless, t
defaulthe 
defaultTioran
default valuation 
defaultwas £950,000 for 792ha, which equates to ~£1200/ha. This represents a 
defaultvery substantial uplift 
defaultcf. the previous NFLS acqu
defaultisition on Mull, in 2006, when the North West Mull Community Woodland Company acquired 691ha at 
defaultLangamull
default and West 
defaultArdhu
default 
defaultfor £343,000, including legal fees (i.e. just under £500/ha).
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultMaryculter
default Woodlands Trust applied in 2013 to acquire 
defaultKirkton
default of 
defaultMaryculter
default wood, a 67ha property approximately 10km from Aberdeen, which was selected for disposal by FCS despite a well-established and active partnership with the community.
default 
defaultAlmost all the mature timber in the wood has been felled in recent years, there
default are substantial areas which have yet to restocked
default, and there is no obvious development value in the wood. Nonetheless the DV valuation was £210,000: i.e. in excess of £3,000/ha.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe DV, in his report on 
defaultMaryculter
default, notes:
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is clear…that demand remain
defaults high for all types and quali
defaultties of woodland areas… The good
default level of demand is partly driven by the investment market where investors are struggling with the unpredictability of other types of investment such as commercial property, shares and banks. Th
defaulte unpredictability of other classes of inves
defaulttment makes land and trees seem
default a safer and more sought after option.
default&#xa0;
defaultAfter enumerating some of the drawbacks of the site: poor productivity, access constraints, steep ground, archaeological features, the repla
defaultnting obligation, he continues:
default&#xa0;
default“However, despite these constraints and problems, the demand in the market place for woodland properties is such that many prospective purchasers would undoubtedly take a speculative approach and make an offer...”
default&#xa0;
defaultAt neither 
defaultTioran
default 
defaultn
defaultor 
defaultMaryculter
default does the valuation appear to reflect the productive capacity of the land or the potential of the woodland from a forestry perspective. The speculative nature of the forestry market is also well illustrated by the most recen
defaultt NFLS application, by the 
defaultRaasay
default Development Group, to buy 290ha of land on the island of 
defaultRaasay
default, which have been valued at £400,000.
default 
defaultThe land is in two blocks: 
defaultInverarish
default 196.40 ha
default (50% stocked, 30% 
defaultclearfelled
default), valued at 
default£290,000, 
defaultand 
defaultBrochel
default 93.90 ha
default (almost compl
defaultetely 
defaultclearfelled
default) 
default£110,000
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe DV’s report is very illuminating, and worth quoting at length:
default&#xa0;defaultThe woodland areas on 
defaultRaasay
default are remote and the ability to extract the timber is limited by the island’s road network and the fact that a barge 
defaultwould be required to take the timber off the island. The majority of the standing timber at 
defaultInverarish
default is ready to be felled and this may well put off potential purchasers who would prefer a more constant income stream. It is my view that these factors alo
defaultne would put off many potential purchasers. Being a small and sensitive island community, any purchaser from out with the island would need to work closely with the community for pur
defaultp
defaultoses of management and extraction of the timber. The close proximity of t
defaulthe main woodland areas to the village and the high levels of public access, all add complications and potential for conflict. The economic viability of extracting the timber to the mill is something that would need to be investigated thoroughly. We would e
defaultxpect that the rate per tonne of income would be considerably less than on mainland locations. This has certainly been the case on the Isle of Mull recently.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe land at 
defaultBrochel
default has a limited value in forestry terms. It will be many years before 
defaultany incom
defaulte is realised from the planting and natural regeneration. There is however a degree of hope value in respect of this land. There is at least one ruined building and an area down by the foreshore which could lend itself to the erection of a small 
defaultbothy
default or l
defaultog cabin for holiday use, subject to ascertaining the necessary planning consents. Similar types of properties have sold well on the market in recent years. The remote island location and outlook lend itself to this type of buyer. Even in cases where the p
defaultlanners give negative feedback as to the potential fo
defaultr
default development, purchasers will often still take the risk as a medium to longer term project.
default&#xa0;
defaultAfter careful analysis, I expect that most purchasers would be deterred by the many factors outlined above
default. D
defaultespite this, if the purchase price was right some would take the risk and purchase the subjects in the hope of getting a return on their capital, or more likely, for the prospect of owning and enjoying a small estate property on a popular and attractive We
defaultst Coast island.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe DV could not be more clear: the price of this land 
defaultbears no relatio
defaultn to its productive value, nor to
default its capacity to contribute to the sustainable development of the island and its community, but is drive
defaultn by speculation and indulgen
defaultce.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe
default Scottish Land Fund established by the Scottish Government in 2012
default and delivered in partnership by the Big Lottery Fund and Highlands and Islands Enterprise
default is intended to 
defaultsupport rural communities to become more resilient and sustainable through t
defaulthe ownership and management of land and land assets, and ought therefore to be able to assist in such acquisitions.
default 
defaultHowever, 
defaultthe Scottish Land Fund
default considers
default these plantations 
defaultto be
default “commercial forestry” and therefore (in their interpretation) state fundi
defaultng to facilitate a community purchase is constrained by EU state aid rules
default and 
defaultthus 
defaultcan only 
defaultcontribute
default to 20% of the asking price.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAnnex 2default: 
defaultValuation for defaultNFLS community leasing: default&#xa0;defaultThe National Forest Land Scheme also gives properly constituted 
defaultand eligible community bodies the opportunity to lease National Forest Estate land. As with purchase, this is to be at “
defaultfull market value
default”, however, the assessment of this is problematic in the absence of a functioning market which might provide comparable
defaults.
default&#xa0;
defaultFCS has therefore created a rental valuation methodology comprising two elements:
default&#xa0;
defaultThe percentage of 
defaultnet 
defaulttimber income 
defaultdue
default to FCS will be on a sliding scale to reflect 
defaultthe increasing level of management input from the community over time. 
defaultMinerals, development rights and commercial activities 
defaultare
default normally excluded from the lease, 
defaultbut 
defaultcould be subject to separate negotiations if the community wished to secure these rights
default during the term of the lease. Sporting rights will be considered on a case-by-case basis, and reflected in the valuation if included.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs
default yet there
default have been very few ground rent valuations for leasing, but these, together with data from FCS accounts and 
defaultprevious valuations for purchase are sufficient to allow a broad comparison of community leasing with the one obvious comparable: the status quo
default.
default&#xa0;defaultFCS
default accounts
default reveal that F
defaultorest 
defaultE
defaultnterprise 
defaultS
defaultcotland
default just about breaks even as a standard UKWAS compliant forestry business
default, and receives &gt;£32M government grant (at 100% intervention rate) to deliver “additional public benefits”
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn contrast, our estimate is that 
defaultif the Scottish Government were to lease 
defaultthe entire National Forest Estate to community organisations through the NFLS, 
defaultthe Scottish Government 
default(and thus the taxpayer) would be at least 
default£40M
default per annum better off
default, possibly substantially more.
default 
defaultThis additional income would be comprised of a number 
defaultof elements: broad brush estimates based on available information are listed below:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIt’s difficult to escape the conclusion that 
defaulteitherdefault FES’s management of the estate is woefully inadequate 
defaultordefault the rentals being 
defaultdemand
defaulted of community bodies are extortionate.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe note also that 
defaultt
defaulthe NFLS lease valuation process ascribes a “market value” to occupancy of the estate of 
default£15M-£20M
default which does not appear in the FES accounts.
default 
defaultIf 
defaultthe 
defaultS
defaultcottish Government
default is making the land available to FES at below market value then this would 
defaultappear to 
defaultco
defaultnstitute a state aid and (unless an approved scheme was in place) would breach EU competition rules.
default&#xa0;
defaultAnnex 3default              defaultStadefaultte Aiddefault&#xa0;defaultState Aid refers to forms of assistance from a public body, or publicly-funded body, given to selected undertakings (any entity whic
defaulth puts goods or services on the given market), which ha
defaultve
default the potential to distort competition and affect trade between member states of the European Union.
default These 
defaultrules were designed to protect the operation of the free market and to facilitate a level pla
defaultying field for major commercial interests with the capacity to trade across member states of the European Union; it seems 
defaultunlikely
default that they were intend to inhibit the regeneration of some of our most disadvantaged communities or to restrict the growth
default and
default operation
default of locally based, not for profit social 
defaultenterprises.
default&#xa0;
defaultFor an investment to be considered a state aid it must satisfy all of the following criteria: the support must be from state resources, confer a selective advantage, have the potential to dis
defaulttort competition, and affect trade between Member States. Where investments are assessed to be a state aid, 
defaultsupport to an
default organisation is capped at 200,000 euro in a rolling three year period.
default 
defaultAny additional investment beyond this 
defaultde 
defaultminimis
default level can onl
defaulty be made
default through approved schemes or

default regulation
defaults.
default&#xa0;

defaultThe perception across the community sector is that civil
default servants and local government officers are taking a
defaultn overly
default risk-averse approach which focuses on the potential problems rather th
defaultan the pursuit of solutions.
default 
defaultOur experience is that if officers see the
default slightest possibility of 
defaulta 
defaultState Aid issue 
defaultthey will treat it
default as an insuperable barrier
default, rather than carry out an appropriate and proportionate appraisal.
default 
defaultThere is 
defaultgrowing
default evidence t
defaulthat 
defaultScottish officials are taking a much harsher line than their counterparts south of the border.
default&#xa0;
defaultT
defaulthe 
defaultcurre
defaultnt interpretation of 
defaultthe
default rules is impacting negatively across a raft of Scottish Government policy areas, including: public service reform and the 
defaultimplementation of Christie Review recommendations, regeneration and community empowerment, land reform, rural transport networks, food and energy security, and the localised reduction, reuse and recycling of waste.
default&#xa0;
defaultState Aiddefault rules: unfairly impacting on defaultCommunity OrganisationsdefaultCommunity organisations understand that they are subject to EU competition rules. However, the current interpretation (and in some cases misinterpretation) of those rules is unfairly impacting on their current and planned operations
default. There are a number of aspects to this impact.
default&#xa0;
default(defaultidefault)Community activity addresses market failure, rather than distorting functioning marketsdefaultA common feature of the activities of many community-based, non-profit distributing organisations is that they 
defaultoccur
default in response to market failure.
default 
defaultTo
default claim that market distortion results from public 
defaultinvestment
default in circumstances where no viable market previously existed, misconstru
defaultes
default the fundamental principle which underpins state aid 
defaultrules
default. 
default&#xa0;defaultExample: Community transpodefaultrtdefaultThe bus industry was deregulated nearly 30 years ago with the intention that the industry should operate on a purely commercial for profit basis. Post-deregulation, bus companies were no longer expected to cross-subsidise loss-making routes from their p
defaultrofitable ones, leaving many parts of the country without an adequate public transport service.
default 
defaultCommunity transport operators have emerged to address this market failure. The regulatory regime for community transport is lighter touch than that for commerc
defaultial operators, with 
defaulta system of special permits 
defaultissued on the understanding that the service is not a commercial (for private profit) business.
default 
defaultNotwithstanding this, and the fact that community transport only operates where a commercial operator is unable
default to deliver an effective and profitable service, local authority officers increasingly cite state aid rules as a reason not to provide the necessary support required to enable community transport project
defaults
default to operate effectively. 
default&#xa0;
default(ii) Community developmendefaultt proposals are stymied by officers’ defaultmisdefault-understanding of the state aid rulesdefaultThe interpretation 
defaultand 
defaultapplication of state aid rules is a complex 
defaultprocess, and those in public bodies charged with project appraisal may have only a limited understanding of the
default process.
default 
defaultA frequent misconception is that a potential investment should be regarded as a state aid if one, or several of the criteria are met, rather than all.
default&#xa0;
defaultExample: defaultAberfeldydefault Town Hall. defaultPerth and Kinross Council were initially supportive of 
defaultLocus 
defaultBreadalbane’s
default plans 
defaultto develop the Town Hall 
defaultand were prepared to lease the building at a discounted rate on a trial basis to give the group an opportunity to test out various commercial ideas.
default 
defaultHowever, officers became concerned about the potential state 
defaultaid implications of plans for a café.
default 
defaultThe
defaultir
default assessment was flawed on two fronts: the potential to give a selective advantage is only one of the criteria which must all be met for an investment to qualify as state aid.
default 
defaultSecondly, the proposed level of supp
defaultort from Perth and Kinross Council through a discounted rent would fall well short of the 
defaultde 
defaultminimis
default level of 200,000 
defaulteuros
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default(iii)default 
defaultThe blanket use of de defaultminimisdefault provisions defaultis inhibiting the ability of Community Anchor Organisations to deliver community-defaultled regeneration.defaultThe Scottish Government’s regeneration strategy highlights the important role that community anchor organisations (CAO) have within community led regeneration. CAOs are multi-purpose organisations that become involved in a wide range of a
defaultctivities within their communities.
default 
defaultThe benefits of such an approach 
defaultare
default widely recognised.
default 
defaultSuch multi-purpose community bodies are particularly vulnerable to the blanket use of de minims provisions, 
defaultbecause while the appraisal of state aid is (or should
default be) made at the project level, the 
defaultde 
defaultminimis
default allowance is 
defaultcumulative, and 
defaultcalculated at the organisational level, so investment in 
defaulteach of 
defaultthe disparate activities of a Community Organisation (and any wholly owned trading subsidiaries
default) is aggregated toge
defaultther
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultSome funding
default streams (e.g. Scottish Government Enterprise Growth Fund and Enterprise Ready Fund) 
defaultdo not carry out any appraisal of individual projects, and automatically classifying all their awards a
defaults 
defaultState Aids, with all investments made under 
defaultde 
defaultminimis
default 
defaultprovisions
default, or through General Block Exemptions.
default 
defaultThis effectively excludes many of the most active and successful Community Anchors from applying.
default&#xa0;
defaultExample: defaultMull and Iona Community Trust defaultThe Mull and Iona Community Trust is a well-established 
defaultCommunity Anchor Organisation which engages
default in a wide range of activity for the benefit of the island communities the Trust represents, both residents and businesses.
default 
defaultThe following list provides an illustration of the range of work being undertaken by MIC
defaultT in recent months and the public funding that had been received in support:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWhile all these projects are unrelated to each other, for the purposes of 
defaultde 
defaultminimis
default calculation the cumulative total is greater than the 200,000 euro limit and therefore the board of MICT are being forced into having to take a view as to whether they can 
defaultcontinue to take on new projects or wait until the three year qualifying period has lapsed. The current definition of 
defaultde 
defaultminimis
default 
defaultlevel
default 
defaultis stifling ambition and preventing progress on the very sort of project which Scottish Government is actively encouragin
defaultg development trusts to take on.

default 
defaultInvestment in several of these projects has been approved under 
defaultde 
defaultminimis
default 
defaultprovisions.
default 
defaultKCFC investigated the potential for renewable energy projects,
default including an application for a CARES preplanning loan.
default 
defaultUsually if a renewable energy project does not proceed, the loan can be written off as a grant, but in this case (because KCFC are deemed to have reached their 
defaultde 
defaultminimis
default threshold as a result of dec
defaultlaring previous public support received for unrelated projects) it must be repaid with interest. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe CARES loan-
defaultwriteoff
default provision was intended to de-risk 
defaultcommunity investigation of renewable energy proposals: unlike commercial companies who can factor a
default percentage of “failures” into their business planning, community groups usually only have one or two possibilities for development.

default(defaultvi) Misplaced concerns about “market distortion” are severely limiting the expansion of community land ownershipdefaultThe Scottish Land Fund was established to 
defaultsupport rural communities to become more resilient and sustainable through the ownership and management of land and land assets
default, however the over-zealous application of state aid rules is inhibiting the operation o
defaultf the fund.
default 
defaultW
defaulthen communities acquire woodlands (e.g. through Forestry Commission Scotland’s National Forest Land Scheme), what occurs is a transfer of assets, not the creation of new assets. Trees do not grow any faster under community ownership, so the v
defaultolume available for harvest and thus the volume that can enter the timber market is unchanged by any transfer of ownership.
default 
defaultIt has been suggested by officials that simply
default establishing a new market actor is itself a market distortion.
default 
defaultWe note that the UK 
defaultGovernment is preparing to transfer the entire English Public Forest Estate (with a market value of hundreds of millions of pounds) to a new Public Corporation, apparently without any State Aid concerns.
default&#xa0;
defaultExample: defaultAigasdefault defaultCommunity ForestdefaultAigas
default Community For
defaultest (ACF) was established by the community in and around Lower 
defaultStrathglass
default in 2009 in response to Forestry Commission Scotland’s (FCS) intention to sell 
defaultAigas
default Forest 
default(
defaultc. 260 ha) 
defaultwhich had been deemed surplus to requirement. 
defaultACF’s application to buy 
defaultthe for
defaultest 
defaultto de
defaultliver a wide range of economic, social and environmental benefits 
defaultwas approved in December 2009
default, but their attempts to raise the necessary funding have been repeatedly thwarted, most recently on the grounds of state aid and concerns over “market d
defaultistortion”. ACF are one of a number of community organisations with approved NFLS applications who are unable to progress until this issue is resolved.
default&#xa0;default(v) Interaction between public funding for the community sector and other public fundingdefault/ 
defaultincentive defaultmechanismsdefault. 
defaultFunding bodies, particularly if operating either side of the Scottish border, do not appear to prioritise that State Aid compatibility runs across their respective programmes. This has been particularly problematic in the field of renewable en
defaultergy in relation to the UK Government’s Feed in Tariff, which was declared a State Aid (even though a parallel mechanism, the 
defaultRenewables
default Obligation, was not) and automatically incompatible with any form of public funding for ‘purchase and installation cost
defaults' of energy generating plant. Uncertainty around the basis of the State Aid decision, and the interpretation of ‘purchase and installation costs' has delayed a number of community projects and led to a loss of public (including UK Government) funding whic
defaulth has inhibited the development of individual projects and the sector as a whole. For example, the Isle of 
defaultGigha
default Heritage Trust lost a grant offer of over £250,000 from the ERDF.
default&#xa0;
default(vi) The burden of working with the State Aid rules can be substantial for cdefaultommunity groupsdefaultWhilst i
defaultt is the responsibility of the awarding organisation to inform the recipient that aid is being awarded through th
defaulte
default 
defaultde 
defaultminimis
default pr
defaultovision,
default it is the responsibility of the recipient organisation to maintain a current rolling total of t
defaulthe amount of such assistance received from all sources over a 3 year period, and to inform sources of possible further aid, should the threshold be likely to be breached.
default 
defaultThis can represent a substantial administrative burden, not least because the thresh
defaultold is expressed in Euros, and different awards will have different exchange rates applied.
default 
defaultCommunity organisations generally have high standards of governance and these liabilities are taken seriously, and often discourage a group from pursuing a project
default even when funding is available- or because of the risk it will prevent them from pursuing other projects.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe note
default that local authorities and some public 
defaultagenc
defaulties, who are eligible to apply 
defaultto public funds
default such as LEADER, have been able to sidestep 
defaultthis s
defaulttage of 
defaultState Aid appraisal by refusing to provide details of previous funding, on the grounds that their organisations don’t keep comprehensive records.
default 
defaultThe complexity of State Aid issues and the need to ensure compliance in order to receive commercial f
defaultinance has contributed to spiralling 'due diligence’ costs from commercial lenders. These are effectively an overhead that the community must include in its project costs, but as they can reach six figures for sub-million pound projects, they represent a s
defaultignificant financial burden and mean that projects must be over a certain minimum size to access this form of finance.
default&#xa0;
default(vii) There is no recourse to a formal appeals process. defaultWithin the UK there isn't an independent appeals process for State Aid decision
defaults, and obtaining an opinion from the European Commission is practically impossible for small projects (and would in any case need to involve the national State Aid teams that would have made the decision in the first place).
default&#xa0;defaultGovernment ActionsdefaultThere is no
default single solution the state aid problem, however there are a number of straightforward actions which the Government can undertake which would greatly mitigate its impact on the community sector
default&#xa0;
default(defaultidefault) defaultImproved appraisal of state aid defaultGovernment should set a 
defaultpositive tone, making it clear that state aid should not been seen as an insurmountable barrier or a pretext for refusal, and should also ensure that all those charged with state aid appraisal are appropriately trained and supported to do so.
defaultCivil servant
defaults and local government officers
default need to be empowered to make 
defaultappropriate 
defaultappraisals
default of projects based on a thorough understanding of the regulations and a realistic view of the likelihood of challenge.
default&#xa0;
default(ii) defaultDevelop defaultapproved schemes fodefaultr community based defaultactdefaultivitydefaultA more thorough-going solution is to develop approved schemes for the activities of community based, non-profit distributing organisations, and to ensure that where possible they are covered by General Block Exemptions. 
defaultDesign and notification of ap
defaultproved schemes would have to be taken forward on a sector-by-sector basis, and it is unlikely that they could ever provide total coverage, however they would greatly improve the situation.
default 
defaultSuch schemes are part of the normal support infrastructure for alm
defaultost all commercial business sectors; without similar support the community sector will never develop to any significant scale.
default&#xa0;
default(iii) defaultAccess to an appeals processdefaultIt would be beneficial to establish an independent (non-governmental) ombudsman for State Aid
default, with responsibility for managing an independent appeals process. This would also give comfort to those who administer the system and promote a more confident approach within the sector.

defaultThis is accounted for under the 
default“Sustainable Forest Management” (SFM)
default budget heading
default which covers forest planning, timber operations, forest protection and maintenance (including deer management), management and development of the estate, and sufficient social and environmental activity to ensure continued UKWAS compliance.
default 
defaultThe apparent o
defaultperating deficit 
defaultin 2012-13 
defaultfor net sustainable forest management was £36.3M, although this includes £31.3M for the value of felled timber: subtracting this reduces the deficit to £5.1M. 
defaultwhich
default was apparently mainly due to the cost impact on impairments to 
defaultthe value of buildings (in 2011-2 
defaultthe 
defaultSFM budget had a £2.9M surplus).
default The
defaultse “additional benefits” are subdivided into
default “Communities, recreation and tourism” (net cost £13.0M), “Environment and heritage” (net cost £7.3M) and “Estate improvements” (net cos
defaultt £12.4M) – in respect of which FCS received government grant of £32.7M
default. The published accounts do not break down expenditure under these budget headings, but they incorporate significant staff and organisational costs, as well as cash expenditure.
default Natio
defaultnal Forest Estate covers c. 660kha. Valuations of ground rents to date range from £20-30/ha pa, which gives a range of £13.2-19.8M. Note, however that these valuations have been for properties designated surplus by FCS and are therefore likely to be below 
defaultthe mean value of the estate.
default Net timber income as reported in FES accounts was £34M, if deductions for restock (4,700ha in 2012-3) are estimated at £2-3k/ha, then timber payments in years 1-5 would be 80% of £19.9-24.6M, i.e. £15.92-19.68M
