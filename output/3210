Written evidence submitted by The Community Woodlands Association (CWA)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Community Woodlands Association
[normal] (CWA) is very pleased to have the opportunity to submit a response to the open consultation on land reform in Scotland launched by the Scottish Affairs 
[normal]Committee in July 201
[normal]3.
[normal] We fully endorse the paper the Committee published to stimulate discussion “432
[normal]:50 – toward a comprehensive land reform agenda” which 
[normal]present
[normal]s a
[normal]n excellent 
[normal]summary of the issues around land reform in Scotland.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]CWA was established in 2003 as the direct representative body of Scotland’s community woodland groups. We help community woodland groups across the country achieve their aspirations and potential, providing advice, assistance and information, facilitating 
[normal]networking and training, and representing and promoting community woodlands to the wider world. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The first community land buyout in Scotland was at 
[normal]Wooplaw
[normal] Community Woodland in the Borders (1987), and there are now well over 200 community woodland groups
[normal] across Scotland, responsible for the management of tens of thousands of hectares of woodland and open space.
[normal] 
[normal]More than half of our members own their woods, the remainder lease or work in partnership with public and private sector landowners.
[normal] 
[normal]Community w
[normal]oodlands are extremely diverse, embracing all woodland types from ancient semi-natural woods to extensive conifer plantations, and ranging from less than a hectare to 
[normal]over a thousand hectares in size
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Likewise, the communities involved range from 
[normal]crofting
[normal] townships in the far north and west to small towns and inner-city communities in the central belt.
[normal]Some of the larger groups employ staff to manage and develop their woods, while others are managed entirely by volunteers.
[normal] 
[normal]Whilst the aims and objectives 
[normal]of individual groups vary according to local needs and aspirations, and the type and scale of the woodland managed, all are working to build sustainable, flourishing, creative, resilient and vibrant communities.
[normal] 
[normal]Scotland’s community woodlands deliver a hu
[normal]ge range of public benefits, 
[normal]across a suite of policy agendas, 
[normal]including:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the past decade we have supported a great many of our member
[normal] groups
[normal] in their attempts to acquire land
[normal], from private and publi
[normal]c sector
[normal] landowners.
[normal] 
[normal]Some are successful; 
[normal]almost all discover that the process of 
[normal]acquisition 
[normal]is onerous, bureaucratic and long-winded.
[normal] 
[normal]Issues around valuation and financing have proved particularly difficult, in part at least as a consequence of the dis
[normal]torted market in and inflated price of land caused by the favourable tax and subsidy regime for landowners.
[normal]Responses to Specific Questions[bold]&#xa0;[bold]We 
[normal]have provided brief answers to 
[normal]a number of questions, as below, and have attached, as annexes, three papers pro
[normal]viding more detail on 
[normal]the specific aspects of the difficulties facing community bodies seeking to acquire assets, especially woodland
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1[bold]              [bold]How does Scotland compare to other countries in terms of the pattern of land ownership?[bold]Official
[normal] statistics on land own
[normal]ership
[normal] are conspicuous in their 
[normal]absence;
[normal] however, there is a substantial body of academic research demonstrating that land ownership in Scotland is concentrated in very few hands, compared to our European 
[normal]neighbors
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]In 2011, the Forestry Policy Group, of
[normal] which CWA is a member, commissioned research
[normal] on forest ownership in Scotland. This demonstrated that 
[normal]that of the 67% of Scotland’s fores
[normal]t area that is privately owned, 91%
[normal] is owned either by landed e
[normal]states or by investment owners, with 55% of the area ow
[normal]ned by absentees.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2[bold]              [bold]What are the benefits and disadvantages of the current pattern of land ownership, and to what extent is this pattern sustained and reinforced by subsidy and taxation arrangements?[bold]The current ownership pattern 
[normal]concentrates
[normal] decision
[normal]-
[normal]ma
[normal]king in the hands of relativel
[normal]y few 
[normal]individuals, a significant proportion of whom are disengaged from the consequences of their decisions: either wealthy enough to pursue their whims or simply uninterested in the land other than as an investment vehicle.
[normal] 
[normal]At the same time the vast majority of those living and working in rural Scotland are effectively disenfranchised.
[normal] 
[normal]This does not seem to be a sound basis for sustainable land management. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The land-ownership pattern is sustained and reinforced by subsidy and taxation arrangements in 
[normal]a number of
[normal] ways:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3[bold]              [bold]Is the current system of land tenure in Scotland the most efficient model for food [bold]security?[bold]No
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Food security is an important strategic issue for all governments to consider
[normal], but the debate nee
[normal]ds to be grounded in the realities of current and feasible agricultural production in Scotland.
[normal] 
[normal]Unfortunately t
[normal]he food security 
[normal]“
[normal]debate
[normal]”
[normal] has been
[normal] largely hijacked
[normal] by vested interests
[normal] 
[normal]and presented 
[normal]as a justification for continued or increased levels of 
[normal]public 
[normal]subsidy
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As will b
[normal]e discussed, much of Scotland’s land is owned and valued for non-productive 
[normal]purposes
[normal]: it seems improbable therefore 
[normal]that 
[normal]th
[normal]is w
[normal]ill
[normal] deliver an efficient model for production.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4[bold]              [bold]In particular, is the current land ownership pattern contributing to, or inhibiting, economic and community development? Is it socially just? [bold]There is a widespread consensus, reflected in the Scottish 
[normal]Government’s Land Use strategy, that the current ownership arrangements are not delivering sustainable development and the broad range of desired social, economic and environmental benefits.
[normal]We believe that the current land-ownership pattern inhibits econo
[normal]mic and commun
[normal]ity development. In many cases 
[normal]c
[normal]community
[normal] ownership of forests, land and other assets is motivated by a desire to turn round economic fortunes and bring about greater economic and community development.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5[bold]              [bold]Given mounting political interest in,[bold] or commitment to, a programme of land reform in Scotland, what form should this programme take?[bold]We have identified 5 key elements
[normal] of a successful land reform programme
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Information
[normal]:
[normal] d
[normal]etailed
[normal] information on ownership patterns, 
[normal]covering both 
[normal]private and pub
[normal]lic sector, 
[normal]should be collated and made
[normal] freely available. Summary management / development plans for all holdings above a 
[normal]given 
[normal]threshold should also be publicly available
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Legislation
[normal]:
[normal] 
[normal]a legal framework 
[normal]is required 
[normal]which further empowers communities with 
[normal]appropriate rights to purchase when that is in the public interest and even where there may not be a willing seller
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Resourcing
[normal]:
[normal] a far-reaching and systemic re-evaluation and re-alignment of taxpayer support for rural land ownership is required, with an 
[normal]eth
[normal]os
[normal] on buying public benefits
[normal] with public money
[normal], and incorporating significant commitments to support community ownership and management of land and assets.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Promotion
[normal]:
[normal] 
[normal]a
[normal] Land Agency body is required to champion and promote the Land Reform Act and the wider 
[normal]Land Reform agenda. (see 9 below for more detail)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Commitment:
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]Land Reform 
[normal]agenda must
[normal] be embraced and proactively supported at all levels of 
[normal]G
[normal]ove
[normal]rnment, with a commitment to change and the willpower to find
[normal] solutions to issues, rather than 
[normal]looking for
[normal] 
[normal]reasons to block
[normal] community proposals
[normal] (see comments on State Aid)
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6[bold]              [bold]What sort of subsidies and grants are available to landed estate owners in Scotland? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the subsidy regime? In particular, are support payments [bold]being capitalized into land values and making these higher than they otherwise would be?[bold]Landed estate owners have access to a wide range of subsidies and grants, both directly as payments made through the Common Agricultural Policy or indirectly as benefi
[normal]ciaries of subsidised fuel or state sponsored research.
[normal] 
[normal]Additionally, landowners can profit from development opportunities, e.g. the current 
[normal]renewables
[normal] boom, itself largely driven by government support.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Some grants and subsidies particularly those designe
[normal]d to “buy” public benefits for the nation, are available to all landowners, and we have no objection to private landowners receiving public funding to deliver such benefits (e.g. provision of recreation, conservation of cultural heritage, enhancement of bi
[normal]odiversity), however this is a 
[normal]relatively 
[normal]small 
[normal]proportion
[normal] of the total flow from taxpayer to private landowners.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The largest single component of taxpayer funding comes in the form of Single Farm Payments, decoupled from production, and based on historic “
[normal]entitlement
[normal]s
[normal]”.
[normal] These entitlements can be traded separately from the land to which they originally related, and continue to be payable even after abandonment of farming: it seems inconceivable 
[normal]to 
[normal]consider that the capitalisation of support payments does not
[normal] contribute significantly to the on-going uplift in land values.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]7[bold]              [bold]How does the tax regime affect the way in which land is owned in Scotland? For instance, does it offer landed estate owners the opportunity to minimize the tax they pay, thereby increasing[bold] the value of land, adding to speculative interest (on the part of those looking for ways to minimize or avoid tax) and making it less likely that it will be made available to others?[bold]We believe
[normal] that the favourable tax regime for private landownership in S
[normal]cotland
[normal] significantly affects patterns of ownership.
[normal] 
[normal]The e
[normal]xistence of a significant 
[normal]land 
[normal]and business 
[normal]management 
[normal]industry
[normal] focused on supporting
[normal] private owners to minimis
[normal]e tax liabilities, while maxim
[normal]i
[normal]s
[normal]ing 
[normal]grants and subsidies from public funds, is 
[normal]compelling evidence of the role that the tax regime plays, and of its
[normal] contribut
[normal]ion
[normal] to 
[normal]inflating 
[normal]land
[normal] values.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8[bold]              [bold]How easy is it for communities in Scotland to take ownership of land and other assets? Should it be made easier in the light of the substantial [bold]achievements of existing community ownership groups?[bold]CWA and others have provided substantial evidence to the Land Reform Review Group
[normal] which set out a wide range of ways in which the process of achieving more community ownership could be made easier. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our
[normal] experience in supporting Community woodland groups suggests that despite the long and successful track record of established community woodlands e.g. at 
[normal]Wooplaw
[normal] (1987) and 
[normal]Abriachan
[normal] (1996), the process of acquiring woodlands has got more protracted and 
[normal]problematic over time, rather than easier.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In part this is because f
[normal]unding has becomes scarcer and more tight
[normal]ly
[normal] regulated
[normal] (see later comments on state aid 
[normal]etc.
[normal]). It is also a consequence of i
[normal]ncreased regulatory scrutiny as elements of government seek to pr
[normal]ogressively define
[normal] and constrain community organis
[normal]ations: 
[normal]it is 
[normal]clear
[normal] that most of the pioneering (and 
[normal]now 
[normal]successful) community land or woodland buyouts would not be possible under current rules.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]9[bold]              [bold]Is there a case for establishing a Land Agency to [bold]facilitate both the expansion of community ownership and the creation of new, especially “starter”, tenancies on land acquired for this purpose?[bold]Yes
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We believe a new Land Agency body is required to champion and promote the Land Reform Act and the wider Lan
[normal]d Reform agenda. This Land Agency would assist and advise communities on the registration and acquisition processes, work with community bodies and land owners to manage negotiations and facilitate transfers, and advise ministers on issues of public intere
[normal]st and sustainable development.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Such a body would require a range of powers, including those to compel co-operation from landowners and community bodies, and to carry out compulsory purchases and subsequent transfers to communities.
[normal] 
[normal]The new Land Agency 
[normal]could be developed from existing public bodies, or created new. Either way, it should seek to utilise the considerable existing expertise within both t
[normal]he public and community sectors
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Starter tenancies should include woodland crofts and smallholdings. 
[normal]We 
[normal]note
[normal] that Forestry Commission Scotland has recently created starter farms on newly acquired land, but has declined to facilitate the creation of new woodland crofts on the National Forest Estate.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10[bold]              [bold]How easy is it for land in public ownership to be [bold]transferred to communities and other private individuals, where that would be in the public interest? Should steps be taken to make it easier? For instance, should the UK and Scottish Governments compile a register showing land and assets for disposal? Sho[bold]uld there be changes in the way in which such land and assets are valued? What UK Treasury rules are relevant to this area?[bold]Community woodlands have been at the forefront of community land and asset ownership, and over 100 woods of all types and sizes are 
[normal]now in community ownership
[normal]. Despite this, 
[normal]transfers remain problematic
[normal], with the primary difficulties cent
[normal]red
[normal] 
[normal]on
[normal] financing and valuation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In 2005 Forestry Commission Scotland (FCS) established the National Forest Land Scheme as a mechanism to facilitate co
[normal]mmunity acquisition of assets. The scheme has much to recommend it, and it has been responsible for considerably more community acquisitions than the much more vaunted Community Right to Buy pr
[normal]ovisions of the Land Reform Act.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]H
[normal]owever the operation of the N
[normal]FLS
[normal] has been increasingly 
[normal]inhibit
[normal]ed by 
[normal]financial issues. Essentially communities have found themselves caught between FCS, who insist that 
[normal]the Scottish Public Finance Manual
[normal] demand
[normal]s
[normal] that transactions are at full market value, and the Big Lottery
[normal] Fund
[normal]/Highl
[normal]ands &amp; Islands Enterprise, who have argued first that they cannot fund the acquisition of assets from the public sector, and then that any such state funding is constrained by state aid rules and limited to 20% of the purchase price.
[normal] 
[normal]Further details of NF
[normal]LS valuation issues are contained in Annexes 1 &amp; 2.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]T
[normal]he transfer of 
[normal]public sector assets 
[normal]would be 
[normal]facili
[normal]t
[normal]ated
[normal] by 
[normal]provision of 
[normal]publicly available 
[normal]asset 
[normal]registers, 
[normal]and the replication of the
[normal] National Forest Land Scheme 
[normal]across the public sector, and we believe these should be duties 
[normal]placed on each public authority.
[normal] 
[normal]However, these measures will 
[normal]not in themselves deliver substantial change
[normal]s
[normal] in ownership 
[normal]patterns
[normal] unless
[normal] the issues over financing are resolved.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We do not beli
[normal]eve that Treasury rules 
[normal]need 
[normal]necessarily 
[normal]lim
[normal]it the ability to transfer land, h
[normal]owever
[normal],
[normal] the discretion 
[normal]permitted
[normal] 
[normal]within the rules 
[normal]is not clearly understood 
[normal]throughout Government, and this 
[normal]militates against that discretion being used. 
[normal]Likewise, there is a pre
[normal]ssing need to reconsider the principles of valuation, especially as the price that communities are expected to pay for assets is often unrelated to their productive value. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Often the assets that commun
[normal]i
[normal]ties are seeking to acquire are more correctly 
[normal]described as liabilities, which the communities are taking on to rescue them from neglect or prevent closure of services and loss of amenity. Nonetheless, the asking price is usually inflated by some or all of the elements desc
[normal]ribed previou
[normal]sly which are ir
[normal]relevant to
[normal] public sector or community owners.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There
[normal] is a
[normal]lso a
[normal] pressing need to clarify state aid rules
[normal], which are currently being used to 
[normal]impede
[normal] community 
[normal]asset 
[normal]purchases
[normal], particularly of woodlands.
[normal] 
[normal]Civil servants and local government officers need to be
[normal] empowered to make appropriate appraisals of projects based on a thorough understanding of the regulations and a realistic view of the likelihood of challenge.
[normal] 
[normal]A more thorough-going solution is to develop approved schemes for the activities of community b
[normal]ased, non-profit distributing organisations, and to ensure that where possible they are covered by General Block Exemptions.
[normal] 
[normal]Further details of the difficulties around state aids are contained in Annexe 3.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Annex 1[bold]: 
[normal]Valuation for[bold] 
[normal]NFLS community acquisi[bold]tion:[bold]The National Forest Land Scheme (NFLS) was introduced in 2005 by Forestry Commission Scotland to give community organisations, recognised non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and appropriate housing bodies the opportunity to buy or lease National F
[normal]orest Land where they can provide increased public benefits.
[normal] 
[normal]Community bodies must be appropriately constituted, and demonstrate that their proposals for management are consistent with sustainable development principles, are in the public interest and wil
[normal]l deliver additional public benefits cf. FES management.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Notwithstanding the commitment to additional public benefit and the general alignment with the delivery of Scottish Government policy, acquisitions through the 
[normal]NFLS 
[normal]are required to be at
[normal] “full market value”
[normal], and this has proved a significant obstacle to the effectiveness of the scheme.
[normal] 
[normal]Valuations are carried out, on a joint instruction basis, by the District 
[normal]Valuer
[normal], who may receive representations from both FCs and the community body, an
[normal]d then values the property on the basis of direct comparables.
[normal] 
[normal]Because public assets are valued by comparison with private sector sales public
[normal] bodies such 
[normal]as Forestry Commission Scotland, who are 
[normal]not direct recipients of single farm payment 
[normal]or 
[normal]tax advanta
[normal]ges, 
[normal]will still benefit from any uplift
[normal] in land prices.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A significant proportion of community acquisitions have been stimulated by FCS’s on-going disposals policy, under which communities have a time-limited opportunity to attempt to acquire properties det
[normal]ermined by FCS to be surplus to requirements
[normal] before they are placed on the open market.
[normal] 
[normal]For most communities this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to gain control of key local assets and resources and manage them for local benefit. Once the woodland
[normal]s are sold into the private sector then the community has very little power to influence management objectives, or even to ensure that management takes place at all, and very little prospect of future acquisition: the Community Right to Buy provisions in t
[normal]he Land Reform Scotland Act are cumbersome, toothless and easily sidestepped by landowners.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Unfortunately, the disposals policy has coincided with a period of rapid inflation in the price of forest land.
[normal] 
[normal]As one DV report notes:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Since 2008 there has been 
[normal]a general downturn in the property market as a whole. However
[normal], l
[normal]and and especially forestry properties have bucked the overall trend and have continued to increase in value throughout the period.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This inflationary trend, and the extent to which land price
[normal] is driven by non-productive values
[normal],
[normal] ha
[normal]s been illustrated by several recent NFLS valuations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Ross of Mull and Iona Development Group have applied to acquire 
[normal]Tioran
[normal] forest on the Isle of Mull. All parties have acknowledged that there are significant ob
[normal]stacles to future forest management: notably 
[normal]disease, 
[normal]windblow
[normal], 
[normal]and limited 
[normal]transport
[normal] infrastructure. Nonetheless, t
[normal]he 
[normal]Tioran
[normal] valuation 
[normal]was £950,000 for 792ha, which equates to ~£1200/ha. This represents a 
[normal]very substantial uplift 
[normal]cf. the previous NFLS acqu
[normal]isition on Mull, in 2006, when the North West Mull Community Woodland Company acquired 691ha at 
[normal]Langamull
[normal] and West 
[normal]Ardhu
[normal] 
[normal]for £343,000, including legal fees (i.e. just under £500/ha).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]Maryculter
[normal] Woodlands Trust applied in 2013 to acquire 
[normal]Kirkton
[normal] of 
[normal]Maryculter
[normal] wood, a 67ha property approximately 10km from Aberdeen, which was selected for disposal by FCS despite a well-established and active partnership with the community.
[normal] 
[normal]Almost all the mature timber in the wood has been felled in recent years, there
[normal] are substantial areas which have yet to restocked
[normal], and there is no obvious development value in the wood. Nonetheless the DV valuation was £210,000: i.e. in excess of £3,000/ha.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The DV, in his report on 
[normal]Maryculter
[normal], notes:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is clear…that demand remain
[normal]s high for all types and quali
[normal]ties of woodland areas… The good
[normal] level of demand is partly driven by the investment market where investors are struggling with the unpredictability of other types of investment such as commercial property, shares and banks. Th
[normal]e unpredictability of other classes of inves
[normal]tment makes land and trees seem
[normal] a safer and more sought after option.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]After enumerating some of the drawbacks of the site: poor productivity, access constraints, steep ground, archaeological features, the repla
[normal]nting obligation, he continues:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“However, despite these constraints and problems, the demand in the market place for woodland properties is such that many prospective purchasers would undoubtedly take a speculative approach and make an offer...”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]At neither 
[normal]Tioran
[normal] 
[normal]n
[normal]or 
[normal]Maryculter
[normal] does the valuation appear to reflect the productive capacity of the land or the potential of the woodland from a forestry perspective. The speculative nature of the forestry market is also well illustrated by the most recen
[normal]t NFLS application, by the 
[normal]Raasay
[normal] Development Group, to buy 290ha of land on the island of 
[normal]Raasay
[normal], which have been valued at £400,000.
[normal] 
[normal]The land is in two blocks: 
[normal]Inverarish
[normal] 196.40 ha
[normal] (50% stocked, 30% 
[normal]clearfelled
[normal]), valued at 
[normal]£290,000, 
[normal]and 
[normal]Brochel
[normal] 93.90 ha
[normal] (almost compl
[normal]etely 
[normal]clearfelled
[normal]) 
[normal]£110,000
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The DV’s report is very illuminating, and worth quoting at length:
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The woodland areas on 
[normal]Raasay
[normal] are remote and the ability to extract the timber is limited by the island’s road network and the fact that a barge 
[normal]would be required to take the timber off the island. The majority of the standing timber at 
[normal]Inverarish
[normal] is ready to be felled and this may well put off potential purchasers who would prefer a more constant income stream. It is my view that these factors alo
[normal]ne would put off many potential purchasers. Being a small and sensitive island community, any purchaser from out with the island would need to work closely with the community for pur
[normal]p
[normal]oses of management and extraction of the timber. The close proximity of t
[normal]he main woodland areas to the village and the high levels of public access, all add complications and potential for conflict. The economic viability of extracting the timber to the mill is something that would need to be investigated thoroughly. We would e
[normal]xpect that the rate per tonne of income would be considerably less than on mainland locations. This has certainly been the case on the Isle of Mull recently.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The land at 
[normal]Brochel
[normal] has a limited value in forestry terms. It will be many years before 
[normal]any incom
[normal]e is realised from the planting and natural regeneration. There is however a degree of hope value in respect of this land. There is at least one ruined building and an area down by the foreshore which could lend itself to the erection of a small 
[normal]bothy
[normal] or l
[normal]og cabin for holiday use, subject to ascertaining the necessary planning consents. Similar types of properties have sold well on the market in recent years. The remote island location and outlook lend itself to this type of buyer. Even in cases where the p
[normal]lanners give negative feedback as to the potential fo
[normal]r
[normal] development, purchasers will often still take the risk as a medium to longer term project.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]After careful analysis, I expect that most purchasers would be deterred by the many factors outlined above
[normal]. D
[normal]espite this, if the purchase price was right some would take the risk and purchase the subjects in the hope of getting a return on their capital, or more likely, for the prospect of owning and enjoying a small estate property on a popular and attractive We
[normal]st Coast island.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The DV could not be more clear: the price of this land 
[normal]bears no relatio
[normal]n to its productive value, nor to
[normal] its capacity to contribute to the sustainable development of the island and its community, but is drive
[normal]n by speculation and indulgen
[normal]ce.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The
[normal] Scottish Land Fund established by the Scottish Government in 2012
[normal] and delivered in partnership by the Big Lottery Fund and Highlands and Islands Enterprise
[normal] is intended to 
[normal]support rural communities to become more resilient and sustainable through t
[normal]he ownership and management of land and land assets, and ought therefore to be able to assist in such acquisitions.
[normal] 
[normal]However, 
[normal]the Scottish Land Fund
[normal] considers
[normal] these plantations 
[normal]to be
[normal] “commercial forestry” and therefore (in their interpretation) state fundi
[normal]ng to facilitate a community purchase is constrained by EU state aid rules
[normal] and 
[normal]thus 
[normal]can only 
[normal]contribute
[normal] to 20% of the asking price.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Annex 2[bold]: 
[normal]Valuation for [bold]NFLS community leasing: [bold]&#xa0;[bold]The National Forest Land Scheme also gives properly constituted 
[normal]and eligible community bodies the opportunity to lease National Forest Estate land. As with purchase, this is to be at “
[normal]full market value
[normal]”, however, the assessment of this is problematic in the absence of a functioning market which might provide comparable
[normal]s.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]FCS has therefore created a rental valuation methodology comprising two elements:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The percentage of 
[normal]net 
[normal]timber income 
[normal]due
[normal] to FCS will be on a sliding scale to reflect 
[normal]the increasing level of management input from the community over time. 
[normal]Minerals, development rights and commercial activities 
[normal]are
[normal] normally excluded from the lease, 
[normal]but 
[normal]could be subject to separate negotiations if the community wished to secure these rights
[normal] during the term of the lease. Sporting rights will be considered on a case-by-case basis, and reflected in the valuation if included.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As
[normal] yet there
[normal] have been very few ground rent valuations for leasing, but these, together with data from FCS accounts and 
[normal]previous valuations for purchase are sufficient to allow a broad comparison of community leasing with the one obvious comparable: the status quo
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]FCS
[normal] accounts
[normal] reveal that F
[normal]orest 
[normal]E
[normal]nterprise 
[normal]S
[normal]cotland
[normal] just about breaks even as a standard UKWAS compliant forestry business
[normal], and receives &gt;£32M government grant (at 100% intervention rate) to deliver “additional public benefits”
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In contrast, our estimate is that 
[normal]if the Scottish Government were to lease 
[normal]the entire National Forest Estate to community organisations through the NFLS, 
[normal]the Scottish Government 
[normal](and thus the taxpayer) would be at least 
[normal]£40M
[normal] per annum better off
[normal], possibly substantially more.
[normal] 
[normal]This additional income would be comprised of a number 
[normal]of elements: broad brush estimates based on available information are listed below:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It’s difficult to escape the conclusion that 
[normal]either[bold] FES’s management of the estate is woefully inadequate 
[normal]or[bold] the rentals being 
[normal]demand
[normal]ed of community bodies are extortionate.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We note also that 
[normal]t
[normal]he NFLS lease valuation process ascribes a “market value” to occupancy of the estate of 
[normal]£15M-£20M
[normal] which does not appear in the FES accounts.
[normal] 
[normal]If 
[normal]the 
[normal]S
[normal]cottish Government
[normal] is making the land available to FES at below market value then this would 
[normal]appear to 
[normal]co
[normal]nstitute a state aid and (unless an approved scheme was in place) would breach EU competition rules.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Annex 3[bold]              [bold]Sta[bold]te Aid[bold]&#xa0;[bold]State Aid refers to forms of assistance from a public body, or publicly-funded body, given to selected undertakings (any entity whic
[normal]h puts goods or services on the given market), which ha
[normal]ve
[normal] the potential to distort competition and affect trade between member states of the European Union.
[normal] These 
[normal]rules were designed to protect the operation of the free market and to facilitate a level pla
[normal]ying field for major commercial interests with the capacity to trade across member states of the European Union; it seems 
[normal]unlikely
[normal] that they were intend to inhibit the regeneration of some of our most disadvantaged communities or to restrict the growth
[normal] and
[normal] operation
[normal] of locally based, not for profit social 
[normal]enterprises.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]For an investment to be considered a state aid it must satisfy all of the following criteria: the support must be from state resources, confer a selective advantage, have the potential to dis
[normal]tort competition, and affect trade between Member States. Where investments are assessed to be a state aid, 
[normal]support to an
[normal] organisation is capped at 200,000 euro in a rolling three year period.
[normal] 
[normal]Any additional investment beyond this 
[normal]de 
[normal]minimis
[normal] level can onl
[normal]y be made
[normal] through approved schemes or
[normal] under General Block Exemption
[normal] regulation
[normal]s.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]de 
[normal]minimis
[normal] 
[normal]regulati
[normal]ons provide a useful mechanism to enable 
[normal]small scale 
[normal]state intervention where project appraisal indicates that all t
[normal]he criteria for state aid apply, ho
[normal]wever
[normal], 
[normal]blanket approval under 
[normal]de 
[normal]minimis
[normal] is being used as a substitute for project appraisal
[normal] against the state aid criteria.
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]his approach 
[normal]is an attractive, risk-free option for civil servant and local government officers, but its 
[normal]cumulative effect 
[normal]is to
[normal] severely constrain future development options
[normal] for community bodies.
[normal]The perception across the community sector is that civil
[normal] servants and local government officers are taking a
[normal]n overly
[normal] risk-averse approach which focuses on the potential problems rather th
[normal]an the pursuit of solutions.
[normal] 
[normal]Our experience is that if officers see the
[normal] slightest possibility of 
[normal]a 
[normal]State Aid issue 
[normal]they will treat it
[normal] as an insuperable barrier
[normal], rather than carry out an appropriate and proportionate appraisal.
[normal] 
[normal]There is 
[normal]growing
[normal] evidence t
[normal]hat 
[normal]Scottish officials are taking a much harsher line than their counterparts south of the border.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]curre
[normal]nt interpretation of 
[normal]the
[normal] rules is impacting negatively across a raft of Scottish Government policy areas, including: public service reform and the 
[normal]implementation of Christie Review recommendations, regeneration and community empowerment, land reform, rural transport networks, food and energy security, and the localised reduction, reuse and recycling of waste.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]State Aid[bold] rules: unfairly impacting on [bold]Community Organisations[bold]Community organisations understand that they are subject to EU competition rules. However, the current interpretation (and in some cases misinterpretation) of those rules is unfairly impacting on their current and planned operations
[normal]. There are a number of aspects to this impact.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]([bold]i[bold])Community activity addresses market failure, rather than distorting functioning markets[bold]A common feature of the activities of many community-based, non-profit distributing organisations is that they 
[normal]occur
[normal] in response to market failure.
[normal] 
[normal]To
[normal] claim that market distortion results from public 
[normal]investment
[normal] in circumstances where no viable market previously existed, misconstru
[normal]es
[normal] the fundamental principle which underpins state aid 
[normal]rules
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Example: Community transpo[bold]rt[bold]The bus industry was deregulated nearly 30 years ago with the intention that the industry should operate on a purely commercial for profit basis. Post-deregulation, bus companies were no longer expected to cross-subsidise loss-making routes from their p
[normal]rofitable ones, leaving many parts of the country without an adequate public transport service.
[normal] 
[normal]Community transport operators have emerged to address this market failure. The regulatory regime for community transport is lighter touch than that for commerc
[normal]ial operators, with 
[normal]a system of special permits 
[normal]issued on the understanding that the service is not a commercial (for private profit) business.
[normal] 
[normal]Notwithstanding this, and the fact that community transport only operates where a commercial operator is unable
[normal] to deliver an effective and profitable service, local authority officers increasingly cite state aid rules as a reason not to provide the necessary support required to enable community transport project
[normal]s
[normal] to operate effectively. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](ii) Community developmen[bold]t proposals are stymied by officers’ [bold]mis[bold]-understanding of the state aid rules[bold]The interpretation 
[normal]and 
[normal]application of state aid rules is a complex 
[normal]process, and those in public bodies charged with project appraisal may have only a limited understanding of the
[normal] process.
[normal] 
[normal]A frequent misconception is that a potential investment should be regarded as a state aid if one, or several of the criteria are met, rather than all.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Example: [bold]Aberfeldy[bold] Town Hall. [bold]Perth and Kinross Council were initially supportive of 
[normal]Locus 
[normal]Breadalbane’s
[normal] plans 
[normal]to develop the Town Hall 
[normal]and were prepared to lease the building at a discounted rate on a trial basis to give the group an opportunity to test out various commercial ideas.
[normal] 
[normal]However, officers became concerned about the potential state 
[normal]aid implications of plans for a café.
[normal] 
[normal]The
[normal]ir
[normal] assessment was flawed on two fronts: the potential to give a selective advantage is only one of the criteria which must all be met for an investment to qualify as state aid.
[normal] 
[normal]Secondly, the proposed level of supp
[normal]ort from Perth and Kinross Council through a discounted rent would fall well short of the 
[normal]de 
[normal]minimis
[normal] level of 200,000 
[normal]euros
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](iii)[bold] 
[normal]The blanket use of de [bold]minimis[bold] provisions [bold]is inhibiting the ability of Community Anchor Organisations to deliver community-[bold]led regeneration.[bold]The Scottish Government’s regeneration strategy highlights the important role that community anchor organisations (CAO) have within community led regeneration. CAOs are multi-purpose organisations that become involved in a wide range of a
[normal]ctivities within their communities.
[normal] 
[normal]The benefits of such an approach 
[normal]are
[normal] widely recognised.
[normal] 
[normal]Such multi-purpose community bodies are particularly vulnerable to the blanket use of de minims provisions, 
[normal]because while the appraisal of state aid is (or should
[normal] be) made at the project level, the 
[normal]de 
[normal]minimis
[normal] allowance is 
[normal]cumulative, and 
[normal]calculated at the organisational level, so investment in 
[normal]each of 
[normal]the disparate activities of a Community Organisation (and any wholly owned trading subsidiaries
[normal]) is aggregated toge
[normal]ther
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Some funding
[normal] streams (e.g. Scottish Government Enterprise Growth Fund and Enterprise Ready Fund) 
[normal]do not carry out any appraisal of individual projects, and automatically classifying all their awards a
[normal]s 
[normal]State Aids, with all investments made under 
[normal]de 
[normal]minimis
[normal] 
[normal]provisions
[normal], or through General Block Exemptions.
[normal] 
[normal]This effectively excludes many of the most active and successful Community Anchors from applying.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Example: [bold]Mull and Iona Community Trust [bold]The Mull and Iona Community Trust is a well-established 
[normal]Community Anchor Organisation which engages
[normal] in a wide range of activity for the benefit of the island communities the Trust represents, both residents and businesses.
[normal] 
[normal]The following list provides an illustration of the range of work being undertaken by MIC
[normal]T in recent months and the public funding that had been received in support:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]While all these projects are unrelated to each other, for the purposes of 
[normal]de 
[normal]minimis
[normal] calculation the cumulative total is greater than the 200,000 euro limit and therefore the board of MICT are being forced into having to take a view as to whether they can 
[normal]continue to take on new projects or wait until the three year qualifying period has lapsed. The current definition of 
[normal]de 
[normal]minimis
[normal] 
[normal]level
[normal] 
[normal]is stifling ambition and preventing progress on the very sort of project which Scottish Government is actively encouragin
[normal]g development trusts to take on.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Example: [bold]Kilfinan[bold] Community Forest Company[bold] [bold]Kilfinan
[normal] Community Forest Company
[normal] [bold]acquired part of 
[normal]Kilfinan
[normal] Forest
[normal], near 
[normal]Tighnabruaich
[normal], Argyll, 
[normal]through the National Forest Land Scheme and are pursuing a wide range of projects to develop the forest.
[normal] 
[normal]Investment in several of these projects has been approved under 
[normal]de 
[normal]minimis
[normal] 
[normal]provisions.
[normal] 
[normal]KCFC investigated the potential for renewable energy projects,
[normal] including an application for a CARES preplanning loan.
[normal] 
[normal]Usually if a renewable energy project does not proceed, the loan can be written off as a grant, but in this case (because KCFC are deemed to have reached their 
[normal]de 
[normal]minimis
[normal] threshold as a result of dec
[normal]laring previous public support received for unrelated projects) it must be repaid with interest. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The CARES loan-
[normal]writeoff
[normal] provision was intended to de-risk 
[normal]community investigation of renewable energy proposals: unlike commercial companies who can factor a
[normal] percentage of “failures” into their business planning, community groups usually only have one or two possibilities for development.
[normal] 
[normal]The limits to write-off now
[normal] represent a serious disincentive to 
[normal]future
[normal] community
[normal] 
[normal]renewables
[normal] as it 
[normal]requires the community b
[normal]ody to 
[normal]tak
[normal]e
[normal] on a 
[normal]potential 
[normal]liability with the risk of having no obvious means of repaying the debt.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]([bold]vi) Misplaced concerns about “market distortion” are severely limiting the expansion of community land ownership[bold]The Scottish Land Fund was established to 
[normal]support rural communities to become more resilient and sustainable through the ownership and management of land and land assets
[normal], however the over-zealous application of state aid rules is inhibiting the operation o
[normal]f the fund.
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]hen communities acquire woodlands (e.g. through Forestry Commission Scotland’s National Forest Land Scheme), what occurs is a transfer of assets, not the creation of new assets. Trees do not grow any faster under community ownership, so the v
[normal]olume available for harvest and thus the volume that can enter the timber market is unchanged by any transfer of ownership.
[normal] 
[normal]It has been suggested by officials that simply
[normal] establishing a new market actor is itself a market distortion.
[normal] 
[normal]We note that the UK 
[normal]Government is preparing to transfer the entire English Public Forest Estate (with a market value of hundreds of millions of pounds) to a new Public Corporation, apparently without any State Aid concerns.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Example: [bold]Aigas[bold] [bold]Community Forest[bold]Aigas
[normal] Community For
[normal]est (ACF) was established by the community in and around Lower 
[normal]Strathglass
[normal] in 2009 in response to Forestry Commission Scotland’s (FCS) intention to sell 
[normal]Aigas
[normal] Forest 
[normal](
[normal]c. 260 ha) 
[normal]which had been deemed surplus to requirement. 
[normal]ACF’s application to buy 
[normal]the for
[normal]est 
[normal]to de
[normal]liver a wide range of economic, social and environmental benefits 
[normal]was approved in December 2009
[normal], but their attempts to raise the necessary funding have been repeatedly thwarted, most recently on the grounds of state aid and concerns over “market d
[normal]istortion”. ACF are one of a number of community organisations with approved NFLS applications who are unable to progress until this issue is resolved.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold](v) Interaction between public funding for the community sector and other public funding[bold]/ 
[normal]incentive [bold]mechanisms[bold]. 
[normal]Funding bodies, particularly if operating either side of the Scottish border, do not appear to prioritise that State Aid compatibility runs across their respective programmes. This has been particularly problematic in the field of renewable en
[normal]ergy in relation to the UK Government’s Feed in Tariff, which was declared a State Aid (even though a parallel mechanism, the 
[normal]Renewables
[normal] Obligation, was not) and automatically incompatible with any form of public funding for ‘purchase and installation cost
[normal]s' of energy generating plant. Uncertainty around the basis of the State Aid decision, and the interpretation of ‘purchase and installation costs' has delayed a number of community projects and led to a loss of public (including UK Government) funding whic
[normal]h has inhibited the development of individual projects and the sector as a whole. For example, the Isle of 
[normal]Gigha
[normal] Heritage Trust lost a grant offer of over £250,000 from the ERDF.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](vi) The burden of working with the State Aid rules can be substantial for c[bold]ommunity groups[bold]Whilst i
[normal]t is the responsibility of the awarding organisation to inform the recipient that aid is being awarded through th
[normal]e
[normal] 
[normal]de 
[normal]minimis
[normal] pr
[normal]ovision,
[normal] it is the responsibility of the recipient organisation to maintain a current rolling total of t
[normal]he amount of such assistance received from all sources over a 3 year period, and to inform sources of possible further aid, should the threshold be likely to be breached.
[normal] 
[normal]This can represent a substantial administrative burden, not least because the thresh
[normal]old is expressed in Euros, and different awards will have different exchange rates applied.
[normal] 
[normal]Community organisations generally have high standards of governance and these liabilities are taken seriously, and often discourage a group from pursuing a project
[normal] even when funding is available- or because of the risk it will prevent them from pursuing other projects.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We note
[normal] that local authorities and some public 
[normal]agenc
[normal]ies, who are eligible to apply 
[normal]to public funds
[normal] such as LEADER, have been able to sidestep 
[normal]this s
[normal]tage of 
[normal]State Aid appraisal by refusing to provide details of previous funding, on the grounds that their organisations don’t keep comprehensive records.
[normal] 
[normal]The complexity of State Aid issues and the need to ensure compliance in order to receive commercial f
[normal]inance has contributed to spiralling 'due diligence’ costs from commercial lenders. These are effectively an overhead that the community must include in its project costs, but as they can reach six figures for sub-million pound projects, they represent a s
[normal]ignificant financial burden and mean that projects must be over a certain minimum size to access this form of finance.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](vii) There is no recourse to a formal appeals process. [bold]Within the UK there isn't an independent appeals process for State Aid decision
[normal]s, and obtaining an opinion from the European Commission is practically impossible for small projects (and would in any case need to involve the national State Aid teams that would have made the decision in the first place).
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Government Actions[bold]There is no
[normal] single solution the state aid problem, however there are a number of straightforward actions which the Government can undertake which would greatly mitigate its impact on the community sector
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]([bold]i[bold]) [bold]Improved appraisal of state aid [bold]Government should set a 
[normal]positive tone, making it clear that state aid should not been seen as an insurmountable barrier or a pretext for refusal, and should also ensure that all those charged with state aid appraisal are appropriately trained and supported to do so.
[normal]Civil servant
[normal]s and local government officers
[normal] need to be empowered to make 
[normal]appropriate 
[normal]appraisals
[normal] of projects based on a thorough understanding of the regulations and a realistic view of the likelihood of challenge.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](ii) [bold]Develop [bold]approved schemes fo[bold]r community based [bold]act[bold]ivity[bold]A more thorough-going solution is to develop approved schemes for the activities of community based, non-profit distributing organisations, and to ensure that where possible they are covered by General Block Exemptions. 
[normal]Design and notification of ap
[normal]proved schemes would have to be taken forward on a sector-by-sector basis, and it is unlikely that they could ever provide total coverage, however they would greatly improve the situation.
[normal] 
[normal]Such schemes are part of the normal support infrastructure for alm
[normal]ost all commercial business sectors; without similar support the community sector will never develop to any significant scale.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](iii) [bold]Access to an appeals process[bold]It would be beneficial to establish an independent (non-governmental) ombudsman for State Aid
[normal], with responsibility for managing an independent appeals process. This would also give comfort to those who administer the system and promote a more confident approach within the sector.

[normal] 
[normal]This is accounted for under the 
[normal]“Sustainable Forest Management” (SFM)
[normal] budget heading
[normal] which covers forest planning, timber operations, forest protection and maintenance (including deer management), management and development of the estate, and sufficient social and environmental activity to ensure continued UKWAS compliance.
[normal] 
[normal]The apparent o
[normal]perating deficit 
[normal]in 2012-13 
[normal]for net sustainable forest management was £36.3M, although this includes £31.3M for the value of felled timber: subtracting this reduces the deficit to £5.1M. 
[normal]which
[normal] was apparently mainly due to the cost impact on impairments to 
[normal]the value of buildings (in 2011-2 
[normal]the 
[normal]SFM budget had a £2.9M surplus).
[normal] The
[normal]se “additional benefits” are subdivided into
[normal] “Communities, recreation and tourism” (net cost £13.0M), “Environment and heritage” (net cost £7.3M) and “Estate improvements” (net cos
[normal]t £12.4M) – in respect of which FCS received government grant of £32.7M
[normal]. The published accounts do not break down expenditure under these budget headings, but they incorporate significant staff and organisational costs, as well as cash expenditure.
[normal] Natio
[normal]nal Forest Estate covers c. 660kha. Valuations of ground rents to date range from £20-30/ha pa, which gives a range of £13.2-19.8M. Note, however that these valuations have been for properties designated surplus by FCS and are therefore likely to be below 
[normal]the mean value of the estate.
[normal] Net timber income as reported in FES accounts was £34M, if deductions for restock (4,700ha in 2012-3) are estimated at £2-3k/ha, then timber payments in years 1-5 would be 80% of £19.9-24.6M, i.e. £15.92-19.68M
