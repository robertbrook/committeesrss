[normal]Written evidence from
[normal] A 
[normal]Cordiner
[normal] (HSR 018)
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]I ordinarily act in capacity as HS2 delegate for Hyde Heath Village Society, I have not been able to meet with the 
[normal]Society C
[normal]ommittee at 
[normal]short notice to seek their approval to this submission
[normal] and this is therefore a personal submission. 
[normal]I would h
[normal]o
[normal]pe that the 
[normal]Transport 
[normal]C
[normal]ommittee 
[normal]understands that at present the Village Society 
[normal]is
[normal] inundated with Government Consultation response work and we do 
[normal]not have the appropriate amount of time or resources to respond adequately.
[normal] As a general comment, HS2 and the government are overloading and placing great strain on our Villages personnel
[normal] as a consequence of their methods of operation
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]My questions relat
[normal]e to the strategic case for HS2 which our society intend to question in the Final Environmental Statement and if necessary with a petition during the petitioning process. Some or all of my submission will be included in the formal HHVS submission to these 
[normal]committees at a later date. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I should also record; I have raised many of these matters with 
[normal]HS2 Ltd, 
[normal]the 
[normal]Secretary of State, the 
[normal]Scrutiny Committee investigation into HS2 and have had 
[normal]little or 
[normal]no response. Given the seriousness of the matters raised I wo
[normal]uld hope you will take this further in liaising with other Parliamentary Committees before reaching conclusions on this :-
