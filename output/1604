default was established in 2001 as The South West 
defaultPublic Transport Users' Forum (SWPTUF) to promote the interests of public transport users in the South West of England (comprising the counties of Devon, Dorset, Gloucestershire and Somerset and the unitary authorities of Bath and North East Somerset, Bour
defaultnemouth, Bristol, Cornwall, North Somerset, Plymouth, Poole, South Gloucestershire, Swindon, Torbay and Wiltshire) - the Forum became a Community Interest Company, limited by guarantee, in August 2005. SWPTUF adopted the trading name of

default in June 2006 and the Community Interest Company changed name to

default 
defaultSouthWest
default CIC in November 2008.
default&#xa0;
defaultMembership of the 
defaultTravelWatch
default 
defaultSouthWest
default CIC is open to every 'not-for-profit' organisation in the South West of England whose sole or principal 
defaultpurpose is to represent the users of any public transport service or to promote the development of public transport services - membership is also open to other 'not-for-profit' organisations' in the South West England who represent the interests of special
default and potential classes of public transport users e.g. the disabled or the elderly. TWSW currently has over one hundred affiliated organisations.
default&#xa0;
defaultTWSW, which is a social enterprise company, acts as an advocate for passengers to lobby for the improvement of
default public transport in the region and works closely with local authorities, local enterprise partnerships, business organisations and other stakeholder groups - with the dissolution of the former Rail Passengers Committee for Western England in July 2005, TW
defaultSW is the representative body for public transport users throughout the South West of England.

defaultHow do Government and local authorities identify demand for passenger transport in isolated communities (including rural and urban areas defaultand island communities)?default 
default&#xa0;
default1. At present demand is largely calculated from existing usage/ actual ridership figures supplied by the operators. We are aware of only a very few instances where bus companies or local authorities have carried out market resear
defaultch to identify 
defaultpotential
default demand as a result of new housing developments, new employment opportunities, or to identify opportunities to reduce existing traffic congestion.
default&#xa0;
default2. We believe that there are opportunities for closer partnership between bus compan
defaulties and highways authorities, and between neighbouring local authorities, to share statistics for road congestion, proposed new employment areas, strategic housing sites etc, and thus analyse the potential for major 
defaultcommercial 
defaultroutes, with the rural routes
default serving as feeder services. 
default&#xa0;
default3. This was illustrated well in a consultation on bus provision in B
defaultath and North East Somerset three 
defaultyears ago. This was run by 
defaultHalcrow
default on behalf of First 
defaultUK 
defaultBus, where a feature identified in the session with the major empl
defaultoyers was that major opportunities for improved services to those employers had not ever been market surveyed.  It has still not been carried out, despite requests from those employers. 
default&#xa0;
default4. Local authorities, and particularly groups of local authorities w
defaultith a "bigger strategic picture" of travel, employment and educational needs, are in the ideal position to see how the various elements of rural transport demand can be aggregated to make up a commercial, or at least less expensive, network of services. 
defaultH
defaultowever such integration has not been active post-privatisation, and there is at present no strategic planning platform for such joined up working between rural and urban areas. or between neighbouring authorities. Furthermore it will require a breaking dow
defaultn of the existing departmental separations, as between education and social services, to identify mutual benefits and savings.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is suggested that the 
defaultnew local enterprise partnerships 
defaultcould assist local authorities in cooperation between authorities, by
default recognising the wider economic benefits of meeting the social and health roles of rural public transport
default&#xa0;
default5. There is further the complication of the removal of 
defaultformer 
defaultcross subsidy between services, so that profitable routes continue to be run to the b
defaultenefit of the private provider while more costly rural routes (which may in themselves enable travellers to access and contribute to the success of the commercially operated ones) continue only through subsidy from the local authority.
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo what extentdefault are the needs of different groups of passengers (e.g. people with disabilities, older people, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities? default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default6. Despite the figures on car ownership within 
defaultsuper output areas, which show between 20 and 30% of residents not having access to a private car, there is a broad assumption that most rural residents who are economically active have access to one. Planning based on this assumption contributes to the li
defaultmited options for employment of young people in rural areas, and lower than expected levels of post-school training and qualifications.

default&#xa0;
default7. The statistics relating to the different groups of those who 
defaultare disadvantaged
default tend to be taken separately rather than aggregated.. Thus school students, people with disabilities, college and training studen
defaultts are calculated and generally only provided for (where provision 
defaultisdefault made) as individual minorities, rather than being grouped into a stronger total, reflecting the nature of rural communities and which could well command a stronger place in the market.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe suggest there is a role for a requirement that Local Authorities look to their statutory requirements in the round rather than within separate "s
defaultilo
default" areas.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhat are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and raildefault services to isolated communities? How can these challenges be overcome? default&#xa0;
default8. Statistics show that the changing pattern of provision of training and employment opportunities (with increased centralisation) and the growing emphasis on house ownership have l
defaulted to increasing travel distances to work and education, services and facilities. In response to these changes the wider social and transport needs of rural communities should be incorporated into all planning processes.
default&#xa0;
default9. In the S
defaultouth West of England s
defaultt
defaultatistics show that the changing demographics of rural communities have left certain groups (the elderly, the children of those families who are still employed on the land and land-related businesses, and those lower paid workers providing for the social ne
defaulteds of these communities) expected to use public transport which has had its economic base removed. In-coming residents attracted to rural communities and able to meet their own transport needs, in turn are thus dependent upon local authority-supported ser
defaultvices to meet the wider community's needs.
default&#xa0;
defaultResearch carried out for the former Countryside 
defaultA
defaultgency showed how many rural families, faced with the need to make regular journeys to work, were maintaining a private car at the expense of a large portion of the
defaultir income, and making sacrifices on food and heating to accommodate that
default expenditure
default.

defaultHow effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved? default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default10. There are good examples in some local authority areas.  However these are largely dependent upon voluntary support, and the variation of quality between authority areas is not considered to be acceptable. For users of such services improvement comes fr
defaultom certainty of provision, resulting in an ability to make appointments with confidence. 
default&#xa0;
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive transport services? default&#xa0;
default11. While taxi services might appear to be a solution, the economics of taxi provision rule this out as meeting rural needs. 
default              
default- Successful taxi services rely upon short "downtime" , and the ability to find return fares. 
default              
default- Rural taxi providers often depe
defaultnd upon alternative sources of income, which in turn limit their availability to provide taxi services to certain times of day
default 
default              
default- People requiring transport are often those on low wages (
defaulte.g.
default farm/ rural business workers, care providers, cleaners, those o
defaultn basic pension, the elderly ) who cannot afford regular taxi travel.
default              
default- Taxis do not meet the needs of those under driving age who seek access to leisure or employment, 
defaulte.g.
default children wanting to go to a leisure facility in holiday periods or young people s
defaulteeking part time employment
