defaultThe legal

defaultEurope with regards to liability regimes. The UK debate is comparatively 
defaultmuted
default (but at a similar level to that in Japan)
default. 
defaultReadiness for reform is difficult to gauge.

default,

defaultLegal issues 
defaultand policy challenges 
defaultof autonomous vehicles
default (A

defaults)
defaultThe legal challenges created by autonomous cars are many and multifaceted
default, ranging from 
defaultobvious issues such as
default 
defaultupdating the
default  
defaultRoad Traffic Act and Hig
defaulthway Code to the law of delict/tort
default, insurance law, criminal law, data protection law, RIPA, intellectual property law, competition law, contract law, disability law, criminal and civil procedural law and the law of ev
defaultidence, some of which involving international laws and treaties.  
defaultBefore attempting
default to give a 
defaultlist, it is helpful to consider a few 
defaultmore abstract 
defaultparameters to structure these: 
defaultLegal issues of autonomous 
defaultvehicles 
default can be caused by 
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAntiquated laws preventing unintentionally the testing, development 
defaultor uptake of
default ACs
default. This creates 
defaultthe 
defaultpossible 
defaultneed to legislate 
defaultfordefault technology
default.
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe technology can create new risks, including new forms of crime, that are not adequately covered by existing
default laws – the need for regulation 
defaultofdefault technology.
default 
defaultTh
defaultis also includes debates on whether the mere perception of risk, e.g. by the wide
defaultr
default population or by insurance companies, merits to create legal reassurances 
defaultthat are not objectively justified.
defaultEmerging legal
default issues of AVs can be
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSpecific to the car and the car industry (example 
defaulte.g. the definition of 
default “fitness to  drive”)
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGeneric  issues created by autonomous technologies (example: applicability of 
defaultlegal 
defaultterms such as
default 
default 
default“reasonable forseability”, “consent” or 
default“malicious intent” to machines)
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultImported from other technological fields, e.g emerging legal issues of internet law that affect the communication of the car with a base station (example: possible data retention duties for car manufacturers/sellers)
defaultAs alwa
defaultys, legal issues can arise on the subnational (devolved), national and international including EU) level. 
defaultFrom a UK perspective, this means that future pressures on the UK legal system  can be caused by
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDevelopments in the technology
default and the needs of the U
defaultK car manufacturers
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIndividual events that create pressure to act (
defaulte.g. 
defaultan accident with fatalities)
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFuture reactions of international bodies and organisations to these developments
default 
default over which the UK has some, but no full control (e.g.  changes to the 
defaultGen
defaulteva 
default Convention; EU initiatives to prevent market fragmentation)
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultManufacturing  developments in other countries that affect 
default UK law 
defaultthrough the legal framework of the WTO (e.g. US car makers arguing that UK safety rules are a trade barrier
default, or that the abs
defaultence of a suitable legal framework is inherently a protectionist measure)
defaultFinally, the degree of legal changes 
defaultthat is 
defaultneeded will obviously depend 
defaulto
defaultn the degree of autonomy and the fun
defaultctionality embedded in the car – ranging from merely assistive technolo
defaultgies to self-driving cars with a human driver 
default 
default“in the loop” to the vision of the fully automated car 
defaultthat like a chauffeur drops 
defaultits owner 
default off at 
defaulthis 
default destination and then drives itself home. 
defaultLegal issues can combine 
defaultissues across 
defaultall of the above parameters, creating a large number of  very heterogeneous 
defaultproblems
default, that make considerable demands on the expertise needed to address them. 
defaultTo give some impression of the diversity of the issues that can come up, 
default3
default examples
default, from opposing
default ends of the spectrum
default, all of which with uncertain legal answers and the 
defaultpotential
default need for law reform.
default 
default1)
defaultA challenge at the WTO that UK regulation on the safety standards for 
defaultAVs 
defaultare unreasonable given the developments in technology and therefore discrim
defaultinate
default against US manufacturers

default2) A driver is accused of murdering his wife with his car. The main evidence comes from 2 on
default-
default board sensors of the car, which operate independently, but whose inputs are processed by the same 
defaultcentral 
defaultcomputer
default unit on the ca
defaultr
default. Are these two piece
defaults
default of evidence and the corroboration requirement of Scot criminal law is fulfilled, or is it a single piece of evidence that still needs corroborating?
default3) Due to a known bug in the car’s software, 
defaulta vulnerability
default is created that allows
default third parties to hack into a car’s computer system and steal personal information for fraudulent purposes. During a hack, the performance of the other software systems is degraded, and as a result the system reacted 
defaulttoo 
defaultslowly
default. 
defaultThe driver
default, relying
default on his 
defaultsoftware, 
defaultdoes not
default intervene even if he could hav
defaulte. An accident follows
default. In the investigation it transpired that the security flaw was known, and that a patch existed, but that the driver had not updated his software for some time.
default The 
default(US based)

defaultacturer automatically updates software for some customers, but 
defaulto
defaultnly if they subscribe to a paid

default“digital divide” issues,

default right to assistive technology
defaultB.2) 
defaultThis section very cursorily and mainly though examples expands on these 11 
defaultcategories
default.
default1) Road traffic law. 
defaultThe UK recently permitted the testing of autonomous vehicles
default on public roads. This seems to  be an ad hoc permission granted on a case to case basis, which is similar to other such tests in Spain  and Japan.
default The US is already now taki
defaultng a more principled approach 
defaultand some states issue licences for AVs
default. 
default Emerging issues:
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGeneral rules on testing of the technology with a view on possible
default future 
default 
defaultlawful use on public roads – assurances to industry, telling them what they need to prove 
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default fairness between competitors/
defaultno “hidden state subsidies” 
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRevising outdated international regimes such as the 1949 Geneva Convention
defaultIf AVs become legal to drive on public roads, all relevant legislation will need updating, as recognised in the Action for
default Roads report by the DoT in 2013. Affected will be in 
defaultparticular 
default provisions that refer to relevant mental states such as “reasonable”, “
defaultforeseeable
default” or “intentionally”.  Example from the Road Traffic Act: 
default “
defaultIf a person drives
default [...] 
defaultwithout due care and at
defaulttention, or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road or place, he is guilty of an offence
default”
default. The meaning of “attention” might change if the car drives largely autonomously, and other activities presently permitted may become permiss
defaultible (e.g. taking a phone call). 
defaultMore generally, h
defaultow should the “reasonable consideration” be split between car and driver (and can cars ever said to be “reasonable”? The inverse question also needs 
defaultaddressing -
default under what conditions should it be prohibite
defaultd for a driver to override the computer?
defaultImportant social and regulatory questions concern the skills needed to drive an AV car, which will differ from traditional cars 
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTransferability of “old” driver’s licenses?
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDriver licenses for people who in the past
default, due to disability or age, were excluded from the roads
default? If it can be shown that their risk would not be higher than that of a licensed driver at present in a traditional car, could withholding a license breach their  rights under the Disability Discrimin
defaultation Ac
defaultt, and possible HR law?
defaultWith “law compliance by design” emerging as a major approach to regulate information technologies (in particular, “privacy by design”) two important policy issues are raised here
default- clarification of the law in a way that it b
defaultecomes “computational” as soon as possible will facilitate the construction of cars that are “traffic law abiding” by design
default- this raises however also the issue if, and if so to what degree, cars should be developed that 
defaultcan
default break traffic laws – should we
default e.g. ever permit a fully autonomous car to ever be able to drive faster than the  speed limit?
default2) Liability (delict/tort)
defaultThis area has been the most studied, due to its obvious relevance for industry and car users.
default The main concern is a
default equitable
default distrib
defaultution of risks between manufacturer, retailer, drivers and pedestrians. 
defaultFears that need to be addressed, though not necessarily through legislation, are
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultExcessive litigation could destroy the new industry in its infancy
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultInsufficient legislation can create
default inadvertently “liability gaps”, depriving  victims of accidents of redress, or leaving drivers with liability for software faults outside their control. The latter in turn could negatively affect 
defaultuptake, even if this were only the 
default perception of risk. 
defaultInsurance regimes will play an important role to manage these concerns, the role of the law here will be mainly to create sufficient predictability to establish rational insurance premiums in a competitive insurance market.  An interesting question here is
default what should be in
defaults
defaultured in the future – the driver, the car or the car’s “mind”, the software that it uses. 
defaultShould no claims bonuses follow the driver (even though his role is now minimal) or the car that has proven its reliability?
default3) contracts
defaultThere are 
defaulttwo aspects 
defaultof
default contract law in this field. One the one hand, contracts will be used by manufacturers and retailers to manage risks. Issues can arise if risk is shifted unfairly between the parties, raising also potential issues within Europe between jurisd
defaultictions t
defaulth
defaultat have sweeping “good faith” 
defaulttests that
default can render void contractual agreements, and those that put greater burdens on the buyer. 
default Liability and contract regimes for AV cars will evolve synchronously. If for instance producers are held liable for
default accidents caused by outdated software, they will write the right to “push” software updates automatically on their client’s cars. 
defaultThe second issue are contracts that the car itself might automatically enter into- paying a road toll, accessing necessary b
defaultut paid-for services such as  GPS data, transmitting insurance details to another car after an accident, are a few possible examples. The legal validity of these computer generated contacts is discussed in the general law of robots and automated systems, b
defaultut will have a bearing on AVs as well
default4+5) criminal law and criminal procedure
defaultUndoubtedly, new crimes and security risks will become apparent once the technology is used more widely. The car can in this case become the target (e.g. by hacking into the computer system) or the means of new forms of crime. As with liability issues disc
defaultussed above, “omissions “ may play a much greater role than “actions”. Investigating AV crimes will require reliable digital evidence, and with that possible regulations that impose duties to store and collect this evidence in a forensically sound way (for
default instance in analogy to the “black box” in airplanes). This relates this topic to 
default6+7) Data protection, internet  and computer law
defaultAVs will necessitate the collecting and processing of vast amounts of data, both on the car itself and in the infrastructure
default that supports it. Given how important the cars for many people, the ability to infer highly personal information from this data is ever present. 
default Since this affects not just the car, but the entire intelligent infrastructure,” privacy by design” approache
defaults are as necessary as data minimisation strategies. It is in this field that the author would see one of the most pressing and urgent needs for action. 
defaultGenerally, ubiquitous computing poses new privacy challenges that current, internet focussed legislatio
defaultn may not adequately address
default. While some of the data will involve transmission via the internet, in particular in cloud based services (whose dangers of privacy have recently become 
default 
defaultpainfully apparent) , other forms of data collection and processing do no
defaultt fit the internet paradigm. 
defaultThis will also cause particular issues within the EU framework. National data protection regimes , despite the EU framework, differ  significantly, with privacy protection in the UK and Ireland considerably weaker than in many
default continental systems. With  cars inherently mobile and able to cross national borders, this can become a problem for interoperability, if e.g. German cars were to be prohibited from processing or storing certain data that they may need when driving in the 
defaultUK.
defaultThe flipside of DP law are data retention duties and in the UK in particular RIPA, with open legal issues to what extend car manufacturers, retailers or owners become de facto  ISPs or so similar to ISPs that relevant legislation should be extended to 
defaultthem .
default8) 
default 
defaultIP, competition and international trade law
defaultAs the example of data protection law above has shown, difference in national laws can result in design choices that 
defaultcan 
defaultimpact on the interoperability of cars and road systems. 
defaultTraditional cars can dr
defaultive on pretty much any road – AV cars may need specific infrastructure to be able to drive. This can raise issues similar to the net neutrality debate- should we require that the infrastructure remains open to all car makers, or would it be permissible tha
defaultt say Google cars can only drive on Google maintained roads, or that their cars get at least preferential  treatment on roads where they provide infrastructure? 
defaultThe much greater complexity that comes with an AV system will generally increase the danger of
default fragmented markets and interoperability. Standard setting, especially international standards, will be the obvious regularity means to address this, and will also have to play a significant role in determining liability issues alluded to above. This will 
defaultinevitably raise legal issues regarding  
defaultstandard-essential patent
defaults and licensing. On the one hand, inventors and developers of AV cars need to be rewarded through appropriate IP, on the other, market fragmentation in the transport infrastructure could be 
defaultparticularly socially harmful
