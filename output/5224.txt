[[[ (BRC 79)]]]&#xa0;The complaints are provided in an extract of an email we received earlier today from the Department. This is copied below and I trust that you and the Committee will find the information helpful.&#xa0;Details on number of complaints as provided by DCLG&#xa0;"For the six-month period April â€“ Sept 2013, there was a total of 179 complaints to the eight scheme operators that include Part P members.&#xa0; Note though that some of these scheme operators also cover other work, so this number may not be for electrical work only.&#xa0; When looking at complaints as a proportion of notification numbers then all eight received complaints at a rate well below 1%, the highest proportion being 0.31%."&#xa0;&#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;
