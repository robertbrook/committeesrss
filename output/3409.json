"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Royal College of Nursing (PEX 0030)&#xa0;1.0              Introduction&#xa0;\n1.1\n              \nWith a membership of over 410,000 registered nurses, midwives, health visitors, nursing students, health care assistants and nurse cadets, \nthe Royal College of Nursing (RCN) is the voice of nursing across the UK and the largest professional union of nursing staff in the world. RCN members work in a variety of hospital and community settings in the NHS and the independent sector. The RCN promo\ntes patient and nursing interests on a wide range of issues by working closely with the Government, the UK parliaments and other national and European political institutions, trade unions, professional bodies and voluntary organisations.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n              \nThe RCN welco\nmes the opportunity to submit evidence to the\n Health Committee’s annual inquiry in to\n \npublic expenditure in the NHS. The RCN has responded to\n the elements of the terms of reference as\n posed by the Committee which it feels qualified to comment on. \n&#xa0;\n2.0              Executive summary &#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;3.0              Plans being made by NHS bodies to enable them to meet the Nicholson Challenge, and whether the NHS is succeeding in making efficiency gains rather that cuts. &#xa0;3.1\n              \nThe RCN accepts that the NHS needs to make financial efficiency savings due to the current economic climate. However, in far too many cases, as we have highlighted in previous submissions to the Committee, NHS bodies are making short term cuts to services \nand personnel rather than well thought through, genuine efficiency savings. \nThese cuts will, and are, inevitably affecting the quality of patient care. \n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nThe RCN’s \nFrontline First \ncampaign collects and publishes data on cuts to NHS personnel and specif\nically nursing posts. The campaign calls for our members on the ground to tell us where they are seeing cuts to posts, where waste is eviden\nt\n and where innovations are developed. This information is the\nn\n robustly verified and analysed before it is publishe\nd. More recently the campaign has developed to use the Government’s own workforce figures. \n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nAccording to the most recent data (for July 2013), the qualified nursing, midwifery and health visiting workforce lost 3,859 FTE roles (6,468 headcount) since \nMay 2010, a decrease of 1.2 per cent.\n&#xa0;\nSupport to doctors and nursing staff, including roles such as health care assistants and assistant practitioners, has also decreased by a similar proportion, with 2,719 full time posts lost (7,058 headcount).\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n              \nAlt\nhough the aggregated qualified nursing, midwifery and health visiting workforce has decreased over the last three years, the picture is more complex than this. Workforce numbers for both qualified midwives and qualified health visitors have actually increa\nsed. The midwifery workforce has increased by 1,311 FTE roles since May 2010, and the health visiting workforce has increased by 700 FTE roles.\n These figures, however, blur the effect of cuts to the nursing workforce.\n If these figures are removed from the \naggregated data, it indicates a\n&#xa0;\ntrue fall of 5,870 FTE nurse roles (or 7,578 headcount) since May 2010\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.5\n              \nAlthough the nursing workforce has decreased overall, posts have been lost from different services at varying rates. The RCN is extremely concerne\nd that the areas which have seen the greatest proportional workforce losses are also those where investment is urgently needed.\n&#xa0;\n3.6\n              \nIn mental health services, the workforce has seen a decrease of nearly 2,000 full time nursing staff since 2010.\n&#xa0;\nThis is de\nspite years of rising demand for mental health care. In England, 48,631 people were detained in hospital for assessment and/or treatment of \na \nmental disorder under the Mental Health Act in 2011/2012, and a further 4,220 \npatients were subject to community t\nreatment orders (CTOs) – a 5\n per cent\n increase in detentions and 10\n per cent\n increase in CTOs compared to the previous year. Mental health services are now showing increasing levels of strain, with evidence suggesting \nthat \nat least 1,711 mental health beds\n (9 per\n \ncent of the total) were closed between April 2011 and August 2013.\n&#xa0;\nThe learning disability nursing workforce has also seen significant long term decline, with 800 full time roles lost since 2010, a fall of around 15 per cent.\n&#xa0;\n3.7\n              \nAfter a decade of\n workforce expansion, peaking in 2009-2010,\n the \ncommunity\n nursing workforce has in \nthe last three years seen a fall of 1,744 full time roles, or 3.6 per cent of the workforce.\n&#xa0;\nDespite rhetoric of a shift from acute to community models of care, the proporti\non of nurses working in community services has changed very little, from 14.3\n per cent\n of the total nursing workforce in 2002, to 15.1 per cent in 2012.\n&#xa0;\nLosses have been particularly acute in the district nursing workforce, which has been declining year on\n year for the last decade, with 1,312 full time posts lost since 2010 (a 17 per cent decrease).\n&#xa0;\n3.8\n              \nIn addition to those posts lost so far, the RCN’s 2012 report on the community nursing workforce identified that services would suffer disproportionately \nmore from an ag\ne\ning nursing workforce.\n&#xa0;\nIn the community workforce, 38 per cent of nurses were found to be aged 50 and over, compared to 23.6 per cent of the acute, \nolder people\n and general nursing workforce.\n&#xa0;\nWith 59.2 per cent of the community nursing work\nforce aged 45 and over, a large proportion will reach \nretirement age\n in the next decade\n, compounding the urgent need to build the community w\norkforce capacity in the future\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.9\n              \nThe RCN is \nalso \naware\n, through intelligence and information gathered,\n of many NHS trusts which have instigated recruitment freezes and \ndelete \nvacancies so that they can reduce their wage bill through \n‘\nnatural wastage\n’ and avoid making direct job cuts\n.\n This obviously has a negative effect on the level of service that can be \nprovided. \n&#xa0;\n3.10\n              \nNursing posts are also being downbanded, \nwhere nursing staff are having to accept the reg\nra\nding of their jobs. It is also where \nexperienced qualified nursing posts \nare replaced \nwith those of a lower band or unregistered health care assista\nnts. The RCN has repeatedly drawn attention to these issues and the risk to patient safety they represent. \n&#xa0;\n3.11\n              \nNurse staffing levels and skill mix have a direct impact on the health outcomes that can be achieved. \nThe Government should mandate the use of\n staffing levels tools\n which allow for local flexibility and variability\n. In too many cases we are seeing patients suffer because of inadequate nurse staffing levels. In \nseveral\n recent \nGovernment commissioned reports this correlation \nbetween nurse staffing\n levels and patient outcomes has been \nidentified; most recently by Sir Bruce Keogh in his review of 14 NHS trust with above average outliers in mortality rates\n. These trusts were put under ‘special measures’ with all of them undertaking urgent reviews of t\nheir nurse staffing levels. \nIt is clear that these strains have been brought about by financial constraint. \nStaffing levels and skill mix must be planned and based on a sound clinical rationale, not budget availability.\n&#xa0;\n3.12\n              \nThere is now an overwhelming e\nvidence base for the use of mandatory safe staffing levels; it is now time to act on this evidence. \n&#xa0;\n4.0              Effectiveness of the mechanisms by which resources are distributed geographically in the NHS.&#xa0;\n4.1\n              \nNHS England is currently reviewing the funding \nallocation formula that is used to allocate funds to CCGs across England\n.The proposed revisions to the allocation formula mean that there will be no weighting for levels of deprivation in local areas, or which have poor health outcomes. Instead, the new a\nllocation formula will be based on the predicted demand for health\n \ncare for the population as a whole. Some of the biggest losers in terms of NHS funding cover the same areas of the country where we have the highest incidences of chronic and long-term illn\ness.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n              \nResearch published by the HSJ and the University of Liverpool on 7th October 2013 shows that, under the new proposed formula\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.3\n              \nThe RCN is committed to reducing inequalities in access to health care. The \nRCN\n believes that the funding allocation should continue to have a\n \nmixed \nsystem of weighting to reflect levels of deprivation \nand also the age of populations \nin local areas, or which have poor health outcomes.  \n&#xa0;\n5.0              Prospects for the long-term viability of NHS trusts and NHS foundation trusts. &#xa0;5.1\n              \nThe NHS continues t\no face one of the most significant financial challenges in its history. The anticipated continuation \nand increase \nof costs saving measures within the NHS beyond 2014/15 will inevitably result in even further pressures on the delivery of services. The RCN h\nas consistently highlighted that current funding is unlikely to meet the costs of the rising health demand.\n&#xa0;\n5.2\n              \nDespite the stated intentions of politicians, health experts and NHS mangers to move services from acute hospitals into the community, both to \nreduce costs and to have more person-centred care, the RCN on the whole has found very little clear evidence of this shift actually happening on the ground. \nMoving care away from secondary settings in to the community must be seen as key to achieving meani\nngful efficiencies and service redesign. \n&#xa0;\n5.3\n              \nThe RCN believes that NHS organisations need to work together to provide real service transformation that brings care closer to home and integrates care around the patient. This can result in efficiency savings and benefit patients, but will require co-ope\nration between trusts and investment in the short-term. \n&#xa0;\n6.0              The impact on the provision of adult social care of the 2010 spending review settlement and the ability of local authorities to make the necessary efficiency savings&#xa0;\n6.1\n              \nThe King’s Fund reports\n that l\nocal authority spending on social care has fallen for four years in succession, and fewer people are using publicly funded care than ever before. With 87 per cent of local authorities setting their eligibility criteria at substantial or higher, it h\nas become much harder for people \nto access care\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n6.2\n              \nR\neducing the spending on social care  will inevitably \nlead to an increase in need and also the further complication of individuals requiring care. The NHS and nursing staff, both in acute and communit\ny settings, are then required to fill the growing gaps in social care provision for patients with increasingly complex conditions.\n 75\n per cent\n \nof RCN members responding to a 2012 survey on community nursing said that the pressure on their team had increase\nd as a result of cuts to\n social care provision made by l\noca\nl a\nuthorities.\n  \n&#xa0;\n6.3\n              \nReadmissions\n,\n or the so-called ‘revolving door’\n,\n are a result of insufficient support in social care or community settings. Nursing staff\n frequently\n experience the frustratio\nn of seeing a healthy patient discharged into community care, only to see them \nreadmitted into acute setting\ns\n weeks down the line owing to the absence of appropriate community care.  \n&#xa0;\n6.4\n              \nThe Care Quality Commission’s \nThe state of health and adult social \ncare in England: an overview of key themes in care in 2011/12\n found that \nif discharge arrangements and planning for discharge are not sufficient, there is an increased risk of emergency readmission,\n the national average for emergency readmissions within 0-\n7 days of discharge that required at least an overnight stay was 2.5 per cent, but this increased to  3.8 per cent\n \nfor emergency readmissions within 8-30 days, where external factors were more likely to contribute to the readmission.\n&#xa0;\n6.5\n              \nA recent report \nfrom the Nuffield Trust and Health Foundation illustrated what we are hearing from our members. It showed that the number of elderly patients who have been readmitted following early discharge has risen from 3,658 in 2001/2 to 6,810 in 2010/11, a rise of 6\n9 per cent. The report also showed that the situation had worsened in the last three years\n. \n&#xa0;\n6.6\n              \nDelayed discharge figures can be used to quantify the levels of pick up by the NHS of social care needs.  On any one day a significant number of patients (ap\nprox\nimately\n 4,000 in England), mostly over the age of 75, are being cared for on an acute ward in hospital when they could be cared for in the community.  In 60\n per cent\n of these \ncases it is\n caused by social services failing to meet their responsibilities\n;\n \n they are either not assessing the patient for community care or cannot provide the care the patient needs to be able to leave the acute care setting\n.\n&#xa0;7.0              The impact on NHS plans of decisions currently being made by local authorities and the use of the additional funding for social care being made available through the NHS budget&#xa0;\n7.1\n              \nThe additional funding taken from the NHS budget - £1 billion a year by 2014 - is intended to be used for partnership working between the NHS and social care\n providers\n, to \nallow for more people to be cared for in the community.  However, this funding is not ring-fenced and the RCN is concerned that this money is not being spent directly on this. The King’s Fund\n shares this concern\n and reports that t\nhe transfer of NHS resourc\nes is helping, but not always in the way intended – \nto \nprovid\ne\n additional capacity for care. Of the money allocated from the NHS to promote joint \nworking this year, 32 per cent (£253 million) is being used to offset cuts \nto\n loca\nl\n authority \nservices and to \nhelp meet demographic pressures.\n&#xa0;\n7.2\n              \nUsing the NHS budget to bail out social care goes against the Government's pledge to ring-fence and protect NHS spending. Without ensuring that these funds are spent on providing social care services, the NHS is still\n faced with filling the gaps in social care provision with all its associated costs and problems described above\n,\n but with £1 billion less funding.\n&#xa0;\n8.0              Progress on making efficiencies through the integration of health and social care services&#xa0;8.1\n              \nIntegra\ntion of health and social care services is not only seen as providing patients with\n timely access to seamless care, but also a way of eliminating costly duplication of services and ensuring patients are given the care \nthey need in the right setting.\n Howeve\nr, integration of health and social care services in England is still very much piece meal an\nd individually programme based.\n \n&#xa0;\n8.2\n              \nWhile there are many excellent examples of integrated care delivery across the country, including specific teams, projects an\nd processes, many of which are led or designed by nurses, there is a wide variation.\n Some examples have been enabled by the development of NHS Care Trusts, integrated or pooled budgets, and the Department of Health’s Health and Social Care Integration Pro\ngramme (HSCIP)\n. However, there have been inconsistencies in policy and project implementation with no significant learning mechanisms in place or application of best practice.\n We hope that the Government programme of integration ‘Pioneers’ is successful i\nn developing a tangible way forward in this area. \n&#xa0;\n8.3\n              \nFunding issues also impact on the ability to integrate services, as RCN members are increasingly informing us, multi-disciplinary teams are being left short of critical impact from social workers and \nother disciplines owing to budgetary cuts.  This means that patients with complex needs are not benefiting from crucial multi-disciplinary \nservices\n, which look at their needs\n holistically\n and aim to ensure that their patient journey is smooth.\n     \n&#xa0;\n8.4\n              \nD\nespite the notable effort of nursing and other care professionals, the structures, processes and systems in place have not consistently been designed around the service \nuser to allow integrated care. \nIf integrated care is to become a system-wide reality, t\nhen consistent political\n focus and leadership at local \nand national levels are needed to ensure appropriate mechanisms, including funding,\n are in place\n \nenable \nthe delivery of joined up care at all levels\n.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;November 2013\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nRCN (2012) The \ncommunity nursing workforce in England.
