&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by the International Association of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists &#xa0;Summary&#xa0;1. The International Association of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists (IAJLJ) is an international NGO founded in 1969 by Nobel Prize Laureate René Cassin, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg, and Israeli Supreme Court Deputy Chief Justice Haim Cohen.  The IAJLJ is an accredited NGO by the United Nations and the Council of Europe and has members in 35 countries. We were established, primarily, in order to further the cause of human rights, to act against Anti-Semitism and the denial of the Holocaust, and to act against all forms of racism manifested against any people.  As such, the IAJLJ has been monitoring matters relating to UNRWA that have implications on human rights.  &#xa0;2. Britain is UNRWA’s second largest donor nations after the United States.  The IAJLJ submits this document therefore in response to the British Parliament’s International Development Committee inquiry on The UK's Development Work in the Middle East call for experts to submit evidence regarding its questions of “whether the British Department for International Development’s (DFID) funding to the Palestinian Authority aides the twin goals of state building and achieving a negotiated peace” and “whether DFID is currently funding the right sectors and working with the right organisations, or whether there are sectors and organisations that do not receive UK funding, but should do.” &#xa0;3. The IAJLJ is disturbed to conclude that UNRWA in effect works against human rights by its financial support of Palestinian entities that incite its youth to murder Jews and Israelis and which work against promoting peace and a two-state solution.  This situation not only contradicts the stated use of British contributions to UNRWA but also arguably amounts to support of child abuse in violation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.&#xa0;4. The IAJLJ has appeared twice at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva in support of Syrian refugees and submits that a more effective and equitable use of funding is to support this refugee problem rather to fund UNRWA entities which contradict the goals of peace, good will, and a two-state solution.Evidence&#xa0;6. A review of textbooks used in UNRWA schools and these video clips entitled Camp Jihadand Inside the UNRWA Classroom provide ample evidence that UNRWA entities support incitement to murder Jews and Israelis, inculcate Palestinian children with the belief that a Palestinian “right of return” to Israeli cities is viable and expected, and negate Israel’s right to exist explicating the use of violent means to achieve this goal.&#xa0;7. The result is a generation of many young Palestinians who would oppose any two-state solution and have been brainwashed into thinking that violence and death in order to destroy Israel is laudable and the only acceptable option.&#xa0;8. In the material reviewed Palestinian children, with rare exception, are taught to make reference to Jews, not Israelis or Israel.  The two video clips contain numerous examples of children from Gaza speak in highly inflammatory language that children could know only if taught by adults.  When asked what the “right of return” means, children answered it means Jews are the “enemy of Allah, must kill all of them,” “it means throw stones at Jews and also slaughter the Jews” and “we will kill the Jews and defend our homeland.”   Teachers at these schools and camps promote this attitude by routinely and openly referring to the Palestinian “right of return” to Haifa, Acre, Jaffa, and Nazareth.  One clip shows a teacher clearly stating in an interview that Jews never had any right to any land in the region and showed children in Gaza referring to their envisioned state as extending “from river to the to sea” (the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea).  The entire narrative taught at these UNRWA-supported entities apparently is that Jews never had any right to any land, Palestinians lived their honorable until the Naqba when Jews deported them, the Palestinian “right of return” will materialize through violence and death whereby all Jews will be liquidated, creating a Palestinian state “from sea to sea.”&#xa0;9. These clips also show Palestinian youth saying “I will defeat the Jews.  They are a gang of infidels and Christians. They do not like Allah and worship Allah.  And they hate us,” “weapons will accelerate the right of return,” “collect stones, throw them at the patrol,” “I want to return to Kafar Kassem whether the Jews like it or not,” “there will never be peace between us and Israel,” [games children play are] “Palestinians against Jews.  We shoot each other,” a Palestinian children reply to the question “how will you defeat the Jews by answering “with missiles,” “as Palestinians we must defend our honor and recapture our land,” “no to negotiations, attacking stage-by-stage is not the right way, if we attack them altogether at once, that will be the answer,” “the resistance in Gaza wasn’t enough, we need to unite and fight together in order to return,” [a song] “when we die as martyrs we go up to heaven . . . children have obeyed the command,” “we learn about Britain which gave our land to the Jews,” “[at school] they teach us that Jaffa is our land is it is forbidden to give it up,” “Jews . . . fought against Allah and became the enemy of Allah.  We must kill all of them.”&#xa0;10. Teachers speak clearly whether teaching children or in interviews.  A Palestinian teacher explains to her class that Jews are “the wolf [that] expelled and deported us.  They killed us and shot our families,”  “we offered martyrs, suicide bombers . . . who here is related to a martyr?  Why were there martyrs?  In order to liberate Al-Aqsa and return to Haifa and Jaffa;” teachers have their students repeat “Palestine is an Arab land from the river to the sea, we want Haifa we want Acre,” another teacher has her students repeat “Glory to a liberated and an Arab Palestine, glory and eternal life for martyrs and the righteous,” “we will liberate Jerusalem,” in interviews teacher says “the right of return is an integral part of the curriculum,” “if students are taught by religious teachers, they will be taught that Israel must be wiped out,” “the land never belonged to the Jews, not in the past and not in the present.”&#xa0;11. In one clip Palestinian education minister, Lamis al-Alami who taught in UNRWA for twenty years before her appointment as head of education for all UNRWA schools and colleges, said these schools do not teach the right of return.&#xa0;12. This clip also shows UNRWA school students attending the memorial ceremony for Awad al-Qiq, headmaster at an UNWRA school in Gaza and head of the Islamic Jihad’s rocket engineering unit and hearing “you were a great educator and you departed as a great warrior.”   Of note, in 2004 UNRWA head Peter Hansen stated to the Canadian Broadcasting Company: "Oh, I am sure that there are Hamas members on the UNRWA payroll, and I don't see that as a crime. Hamas as a political organization does not mean that every member is a militant, and we do not do political vetting and exclude people from one persuasion as against another.”  In 2010 Canada decided to redirect some of its aid from UNRWA to specific projects.&#xa0;13. Palestinian Authority textbooks contain similar language.&#xa0;Returning, returning, we are returningBorders shall not exist, nor citadels and fortressesCry out, O those who have left:We are returningReturning to the homes, to the valleys, to the mountainsUnder the flag of glory, Jihad and struggleWith blood, sacrifice, fraternity and loyaltyWe are returningReturning, O hills; returning, O heightsReturning to childhood; returning to youthTo Jihad in the hills, [to] harvest in the land"(Our Beautiful Language, Grade 5, Part 1 (2011) p. 50).&#xa0;According to another Palestinian Authority textbook, there are no Jewish rights whatsoever in Palestine – only "greedy ambitions" [Atmaa'] (National Education, Grade 7 (2011) p. 20).&#xa0;"Good morning, O my homeland…A morning of glory and red liberty, watered by the martyrs' blood…[Assignment:] I will reconcile the following poetic lines with the feelings they express:'A morning of glory and red liberty, watered by the martyrs' blood…' – The hope for the liberation of Palestine."(Reading and Texts, Grade 9, Part 1 (2012) pp. 9-10, 12)&#xa0;O brother, the oppressors have exceeded all bounds and

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;Conclusions&#xa0;14. The evidence brought herein clearly shows that UNRWA has veered form its mandate as a United Nations organization created to assist Palestinian refugees to an organization that promotes radicalism among the refugee community it purports to assist, a radicalism that inculcates in children a mentality of death and martyrdom and against a peace process that leads to a two-state solution.  Further, by its support of radical Palestinian entities, UNRWA not only violates its mandates but works in contradistinction to the UN Charter.&#xa0;15. The evidence brought herein should be viewed in the context of the UN Convention on the Rights of Children.                Article 3(1): In all actions concerning children . . . the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.Article 6: States Parties recognize that every child has the inherent right to life . . . States Parties shall ensure to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of the child.Article 28(2): States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that school discipline is administered in a manner consistent with the child's human dignity and in conformity with the present Convention&#xa0;16. The inquiry commission ought to prioritize that British funds are appropriated to proper humanitarian projects and that funds which could be saved from inappropriate projects such as UNRWA be invested in these, the best of example of which is the humanitarian crisis in Syria which led to millions of refugees in the last two years.&#xa0;1&#xa0; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iURo_lsdXvA https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=QbzZ7fIFoaE#at=598&#xa0; http://www.jmcc.org/people.aspx?idd=290 http://www.meforum.org/1896/defund-unrwa Canada Seeks Clarity on U.N.-Hamas Link, United Press International, October 4, 2004 http://www.jta.org/2010/01/14/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/canada-redirecting-palestinian-aid-from-unrwa&#xa0; http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx&#xa0;
