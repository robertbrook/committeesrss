[[[Introduction]]]Special Olympics brings together more than 4.2 million athletes with intellectual disabilities across 175 countries. Established in 1978, we provide year round training and competition opportunities for children and adults with intellectual disabilities in 33 different sports every single day. We don't just support athletes but their families too. We recognise the correlation between poverty and disability and the further impact that impoverishment has on those already marginalised by disability.&#xa0;Participating in sports helps people with intellectual disabilities become more confident, active citizens and learn important physical and emotional life skills. But the Special Olympics movement is about more than just sport – we run education, early intervention training and health screening programmes to create more inclusive communities and improve the general health and wellbeing of our athletes.Special Olympics is helping foster a more inclusive society by highlighting ability over disability, allowing people with intellectual disability to realise their potential whilst also breaking down inaccurate and negative perceptions about intellectual disability amongst the wider community. We welcome this opportunity to submit evidence to the International Development Committee and would be delighted to provide further, oral evidence to the inquiry. For further information on the Special Olympics visit:  http://www.specialolympics.org/ Given the broad focus of this inquiry, we have addressed the following issues of specific interest where Special Olympics have real experience of delivering effective programmes:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[1.2]]]&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[The adequacy of DFID’s current policy commitments on disability and development, and whether it needs a disability strategy]]]It is the Special Olympics’ firm belief that DFID should develop a clear disability strategy – and one that explicitly seeks to address the challenges faced by people with intellectual disabilities across the world.  &#xa0;Individuals with intellectual disabilities represent one of the most marginalized and underserved groups in the world today.  Representing approximately 3% of the world’s population, individuals with intellectual disabilities are subjected to some of the most the worst abuses and rights deprivation the world has ever seen.  These individuals suffer the lowest child survival and education rates, and some of the highest abuse and health disparity rates in the world.  &#xa0;Despite global reporting on this epidemic from the World Health Organization’s World Report on Disability, UNICEF’s 2013 State of the World’s Children Report, and the recent UN High Level Meeting on Disability and Development, development assistance and aid falls woefully short in providing direct support and investment in improving their social protection, education, access to health, employment – and most importantly, their right to life. Nowhere in the world has this epidemic come with more dire consequences for the population than in Africa.  &#xa0;DFID has traditionally led the world on disability-inclusive development. Recent initiatives – include the announcement that all new DFID-funded schools will be accessible to disabled children, the Department’s calls for better global data on disability and an increased emphasis on disabled people in future development targets – have all been welcome. &#xa0;However, DFID’s current policy commitments on disability and development do not go far enough in addressing the strong link between disability and poverty. Removing barriers to the participation of disabled people in society should be a cornerstone of DFID’s policies and development work.

[[[ntegration of disability issues within DFID’s sector programmes (for example in health, education, sanitation, livelihoods, ]]]

[[[and empowerment) and its humanitarian work.]]]The Special Olympics’ goal is to end the cycle of poverty and exclusion faced by people with intellectual disabilities.  People with intellectual disabilities are regularly excluded from government-run disability programmes which more often focus on physical disabilities. We believe that DFID should fully integrate disability issues – particularly those associated with intellectual disabilities – into all its sector programmes. Evidence of the effect of poverty on people with intellectual disabilities across the different DFID sector programmes includes:

[[[Community and political participation]]]Our work in the areas of inclusive sports, global health, early childhood development, family support and youth activation could support DFID’s development work throughout Africa and serve as ‘best practice’ that DFID can offer to additional assistance programmes.

[[[The ]]]

[[[effectiveness of DFID’s approach to rehabilitation and service provision for disabled people.]]]DFID has been a leading development stakeholder in driving critical support for people with disabilities across many parts of the world.  As part of a renewed disability and development approach – and one that focuses on rehabilitation and service provision – DFID stands to make one of the largest and most sustained impact of any foreign aid.  &#xa0;For people with intellectual disabilities, the ‘service provision’ aspect of DFID’s programme  is of the highest importance.  As already highlighted, people with intellectual disabilities (especially children) face some of the lowest access rates of any marginalised population subset in the world.  Education, health care, social protection, advocacy services and recreation still remain very much out of reach to this population.  In addition, most sectors, including education and health across developing nations, are in desperate need of disability health care training, special teachers, inclusive education training, youth sensitisation campaigns, and much more to create a viable setting for true inclusive development that will benefit the groups most in need.  &#xa0;In an effort to increase the effectiveness of service provision for people with intellectual disabilities, we believe DFID should integrate the population into mainstreamed initiatives, while also helping to create and resource important training opportunities for doctors, teachers, and government officials so that people with intellectual disabilities are fully integrated into society.

[[[The strength of the evidence base on ‘what works’ in development programmes involving disabil]]]

[[[ity.]]]Special Olympics have a wealth of evidence demonstrating the impact that development programmes can have on people with intellectual disabilities. A particularly successful programme has focused on health screening. 200 million people with intellectual disabilities are denied access to quality health services and we have been working through the Healthy Athletes programme to offer participants free health screenings, education, and referrals for follow-up care.&#xa0;&#xa0; Special Olympics believe that every person with an intellectual disability and their family should be provided with the information and support to understand what they need to do in order to optimize their health. In order for this to be achieved information, resources, systems and policies must exist at an individual, community and national level to support individuals and their families to realise healthy and productive lives. In Africa, over 27,000 free health screenings have been provided by Special Olympics between 2007-2013. This has allowed basic access to health care for over 18,500 Special Olympics athletes in 33 countries.The results of these screenings illustrates the value of this care and highlight the striking disparity of access to healthcare for people with intellectual disability living in the developing world compared to their global counterparts.&#xa0; For example, in Africa 72.5% of athletes screened by Special Olympics to date had never had an eye exam before, compared to 23.5% of Special Olympics athletes globally.Through a system of community partnership, Special Olympics aims to develop a network of local community health providers [in each country we work in] that are engaged with the Special Olympics’ health work and committed to providing ongoing health resources and services to people with intellectual disability and their families. Through this network, we aim to ensure that all athletes remain engaged with the health system throughout their lives. Over the next three years Special Olympics will be piloting the Healthy Communities programme in the following countries: Peru, Mexico, South Africa, Malawi, Romania, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Thailand, and within the U.S. in Wisconsin, Arizona, Kansas, New York, New Jersey, and Florida.The Healthy Communities programme aims to&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Raise awareness around the issue of health disparities facing people with intellectual disability worldwide; &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Foster increased international development cooperation focused on delivering care to this marginalized population, and;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Ultimately create communities where Special Olympics athletes and others with intellectual disability have the same access to health and wellness resources – and can attain the same level of good health – as all community members.&#xa0; December 2013&#xa0;
