[normal][1] The Strategic case
[normal]Issues to be addressed
[normal]8. The Strategic case report (SCR) records the forecast journey timesavings and the economic case for HS2 is based on timesaving. However the strategic case also includes two aspects of predicted need for capacity increases:
[normal]9. Track capacity[bold] - The Strategic case report shows that the 18 North/South main line tracks going to and from London have high usage near London due to the number of commuter trains and the fact that 6 of the tracks also carry inter city services (SCR, p.15 fig. 5). Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, Leeds, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Sheffield and Newcastle have a similar problems of insufficient train pathways i.e. track capacity. The faster trains travel the fewer train pathways are available on each track. The number of train pathways is also heavily dependant on the track signaling technology.
[normal]10. Seat capacity[bold] - The Strategic case report shows that seat capacity on many commuter lines today are unsatisfactory, with a 1.5% annual growth becoming intolerable in the near future  (SCR, p.17 fig. 7). Intercity routes may also start to get seat capacity problems in the future assuming an aggregate growth rate (AGR) of above 2.5%/year. The graphs provided by HS2 are only indicative but they show that the problem is greatest on commuter trains generally, and that intercity Birmingham and Manchester are a bigger problem than London. The main intercity concern is due to weekend leisure trips that occur for 6 hours/week resulting in demand 20%-25% higher than at any other time during the week.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]HS2 lacks logic
[normal]11. The Government’s argument for building a new 250mph non-integrated line is that they are convinced that a new North/South line is required based on passenger demand forecasts. They take the view that any new line will cost about the same so we might as well have the fastest available. They have been led to a scheme developed between 2006 and 2009 by the lobby group Greengauge21. No attempt has been made to investigate the overall travel market and to seriously consider alternatives. In response to a 2011 freedom of Information request (FOI) seeking information on the evaluation of the alternatives the DfT responded, “
[normal]You may think we would have developed optimised alternatives and assessed the best but we did not do so and we have no further information available
[normal]”.
[normal]12. The key problems are commuter seat capacity, train pathway capacity and, further into the future, the peak and weekend intercity capacity. HS2 is a solution that provides the most intercity seats but at a cost. The train pathways that would be provided by HS2 are not as high as they could be and commuter seat capacity problems (that could be addressed with the alternative solutions) are not resolved until 2035 and beyond.
[normal]13. Figure 1 is based on information in the strategic case (SCR, p.17 fig 7). It indicates how much extra capacity is required to provide sufficient seats to cover the Friday and Sunday afternoon peaks. We call this case “High fares” because fares would need to increase by up to 50% across the board if this amount of track and rolling stock capacity is to be provided. The economic line indicates a far more economic level of capacity, while it leaves some standing at peaks times it means lower fares for all passengers. The HS2 scheme provides capacity to covers the peaks with further spare capacity ultimately leading to people paying high prices for unused resources.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Figure 1. Graph showing typical seat utilization and economic level of seating capacity [bold] 
[normal]Potential Risks
[normal]13. The Strategic case claims that the HS2 scheme will improve resilience. To put the rail traffic from three mainline routes with access to 12 tracks onto two tracks where trains converge every 3 minutes at about 450mph is not an example of a resilient system. Sadly, people choose railway lines as a place to commit suicide and while HS2 will presumably have extensive fencing, CCTV along the route and will be floodlit, in the event there is a suicide it will quickly bring the entire system to a halt, in both directions, as trains will need to stop very quickly behind each other. 
[normal]13a. As Systra explain in their line capacity report, with 16-18 trains per hour at the proposed line speed it will be like the M25 in a traffic jam, any requirement to slow down significantly will bring a wave of stationary traffic. 
[normal]13b. Of even greater concern would be a derailment, in all probability if a train derails onto the other line there will be a head on crash. As far as we are aware, HS2 Ltd has not carried out a safety case or risk assessment of these sort “best not to talk about” potential risks. It is not clear how a threat to derail a train, whether as a hoax or a serious threat, will be treated operationally.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Strategic Alternatives 
[normal]14. The HS2 Ltd assessment of the alternatives to upgrade the existing lines show better economics, and far less risk than HS2 they also have sufficient capacity for the foreseeable future. This evaluation of the alternatives is a step forward to reaching a good decision but the DfT have still not looked at the issues or potential solutions in sufficient detail.
[normal]15. As an example, the Strategic case report shows that of the 30 London Midland trains leaving Euston between 15.54 and 19.34, 20 have insufficient seats (SCR: p.61 fig.2.16), and of these 14 could be extended by additional carriages. At the current maximum carriage configuration, two additional train pathways during the 30 minutes of evening peak would be required to reduce the extent of standing identified on the remaining 6 trains. However, given the disproportionate cost of providing seating to cover all peak times it is probably far better to use a pricing solution to address the issue. As a minimum, passengers should be surveyed on whether they would rather have limited duration standing or accept the fare increases required to provide significantly more capacity to address the problem.
[normal]16. After a full and comprehensive analysis of the detailed issues, the identification of potential upgrade solutions across the network and even perhaps some vital understanding from the Swiss rail system about scheduling and how to carry out track improvement without severe disruption, it is very doubtful a new North/South line would be a priority during the next 30-40 years. 
[normal]17. However, if for political reasons the Government is determined to build a new line then the current HS2 scheme must be properly compared to a 160mph scheme that would integrate into the existing system, enabling full utilization of the new track pathways into the regional cities and utilising tilting trains with faster curve speeds when running on conventional track. 
[normal]18. A scheme such as this would provide more train pathways, more direct routes and service improvement to more locations, with the potential of more new seats and the flexibility to move these seats between routes as required. The scheme would cost less money, have fewer emissions, do less environmental damage, would provide far more resilience and would probably overall have an equivalent level of time saving. It would however have marginally longer journey times between the three cities served directly by HS2.
[normal]19. The DfT may disagree with our assertions concerning alternatives, however it is a matter of fact that they have not commissioned the work to properly assess any new line other than a 250mph, minimum stops, city centre to city centre minimum travel time, non-integrated HS2 type scheme.  In May 2012 they assured an Information Tribunal judge that they have no information on the alternatives to HS2 beyond the summary Atkins report that covered upgrade schemes that were not comprehensive or optimized.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What do businesses think is important?
[normal]20. The Strategic case report explains the anticipated value of HS2 contracts (SCR: p.93 fig.5.3). For UK businesses it is important that this money goes into, and filters down through, the UK economy. The Minister for transport has told MPs that 97% of Crossrail’s contracts are placed with UK companies and has indicted that a similar figure would be applicable for HS2. However Crossrail have clarified that this is the percent of the number of contracts, not their value. Taking the ministers approach, a small service contract for £10,000 would be equal to the £400 Million tunneling contract placed with the largely foreign owned 
[normal]Dragados S.A., John Sisk &amp; Son (Holdings) Ltd. Joint Venture
[normal] as each one counts for 1 contract. 
[normal]21. In practice about 50% of the value has been placed with foreign owned companies. Crossrail do not know what value actually goes into the UK economy but typically on projects involving specialist aspects (e.g. tunneling and HSR systems) the value going outside of the UK will be in excess of 25% (i.e. about £10bn) of the total contacts value. Smaller rail and road improvement schemes will have nearer 100% domestic value content.
[normal]22. The KPMG/CBI Infrastructure Survey (2013) indicates businesses’ priorities for transport improvement
[normal]. The survey reports that the respondents believe the UK should invest more in Infrastructure generally. This is probably correct although it should be noted that 31% of the respondents were infrastructure providers and the KPMG group that carried out the work provide accounting and consultancy services to infrastructure providers. 
[normal]23. KPMG’s analysis of the survey focusing on transport concluded: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]24. KPMG comment that they think the anticipation of HS2 improving service on the route in 14 years time has had the effect of increasing current satisfaction levels.
[normal]25. The National Audit Office and the Public accounts Committee have both recently expressed concerns about the affordability of the Government proposed Infrastructure investment. The injection of taxpayers money into the economy over the next few years may help promote an economic recovery, if that is not already occurring, and more infrastructure maybe more important than other services or reducing the national debt, however it will need to be paid for, with interest, by future generations of consumers and tax payers.
[normal]26. It is not obvious that beyond the rail industry lobby, i.e. the
[normal] commercial organisations that will directly benefit from it’s construction, that 
[normal]there is business support for HS2 as a priority over investment in the extensive list of alternative infrastructure projects most with better Benefit Cost Ratios or for increased expenditure on education and skills training.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal][2] The Economic case
[normal]27. Since the publication of Bluespace Thinking’s first evaluation of the HS2 proposals in April 2010, the DfT have corrected some of the issues we and others have identified. These include long distance passenger demand growth elasticities, the value of business time salary assumptions, flaws in the economic evaluation of the upgrade alternatives, the assumptions of underlying travel growth and the scope for mode transfer in addition to a number of other errors. However a number of further flaws still remain, the most significant of which are the focus of this next section. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Two Major Flaws 
[normal]Two Doubtful Assumptions
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Value of Time Growth
[normal]32. Following the controversy over the actual level of the current Value of Time and the extent to which passengers work on trains, HS2 Ltd and the DfT have allowed for a lower level of implied salary but not adjusted for peoples ability to work on trains. However, they have then inflated this figure at the same rate as forecast GDP through to 2093. This results in a value 5 times greater in real terms in 2093 than in 2011. That is the equivalent salary of about £50,000 to £60,000, on which the current Webtag Draft 3.5.6 and HS2 economic case is based, rises to £250,000 to £300,000 as valued in 2011 (i.e. without future inflation) by 2093.
[normal]33. At the same time operating costs calculated from staff salaries are inflated on a different basis and are curtailed from further growth in 2035.
[normal]34. It is crucial in economic analysis that the growth of costs and benefits are treated in a similar fashion, failure to do so produces fundamentally flawed results. Figure 2 shows the impact of these different assumptions on the key cost and benefit streams with the index of 1 set in 2011.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Figure 2. Growth Index of assumed average earning growth and assumed Value of Time growth[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]35. The impact of these growth assumptions is to produce excessive Present Values for the Value of Time at the later stages of the evaluation period. Figure 3 shows the impact on the PVs of the total user benefits if the assumptions for earnings growth are applied to the Value of Time calculations. This reduces the phase 1 benefits by 27% and those for the full scheme by 31%.
[normal]36. The HS2 Ltd Economic Case report provides a graph that shows the PVs of the user benefits and operating costs (ECR: p.24 fig.5) from which it is (to an experienced commercial eye) evident that a variation in assumptions exists.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Figure 3. Variation in User benefits Present Values attributable to VOT growth assumptions[bold]Business Passenger Demand Growth
[normal]37. As a result of revised DfT guidance on passenger demand forecasting and Value of Business Time, it was widely expected by those familiar with the HS2 evaluations that the BCRs for the project would collapse. However as the revised Economic case shows only a small drop in BCR value, it is reasonable to assume that some other parameters were adjusted to compensate. 
[normal]38.The detailed spreadsheets published on the HS2 website at the same time as the economic case show that the proportion of business passengers assumed on Long Distance (LD) routes has been changed from 28% (Aug 2012) to about 38%, producing a 36% increase in business passengers with their associated user benefits and ticket revenues. On further inspection it is also evident that from 2010 the rate of growth of business passengers is far greater than for other users. Figure 4 shows a graph of the past trend based on Office of the Rail Regulator (ORR) and National Passenger Survey data against the HS2 Ltd forecast. It shows the sudden jump in 2010 and then the continued very high levels of growth throughout the period to 2036 with jumps as HS2 phases 1 and 2 commence operations.
[normal]39.We consider that as a consequence of these apparently unjustified adjustments the Present Value of Business User benefits is, at a minimum, about a third higher than that which is reasonable, this is in addition to the adjustment required for Value of Time growth previously discussed.
[normal]Figure 4. Long Distance rail (passenger kms Bn), past trend from ORR and NPS, HS2 Ltd forecast[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Financing
[normal]40. It is very unlikely that the Government will self fund the HS2 Full Scheme projects. Based on the financing arrangements for Network Rail and past PFI schemes for Hospitals the financing cost could be huge. Typically Network rail pay interest at about 3% above inflation, PFI scheme may well pay 5-6% above.
[normal]41. We have conservatively assumed a very small 15% uplift to the capital costs to assess the impact on BCR of financing at substantially less than commercial rates. As a point of interest, late financing as used on HS1 is unlikely to be possible on HS2, after allowing for full inflation of the operating costs the scheme is marginally self-financing during the operating phase even before any reduction in ticket revenue from reduced business users.
[normal]42. It is doubtful that the tax from any increased value added benefit of HS2 will cover the interest charges even if Government financing costs just 1% above inflation. Put another way the scheme has a high chance of adding to the national debt in perpetuity.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Impact on the Economic Evaluation
[normal]43. Based on the two flaws and the doubtful financing assumption we have prepared revised BCR calculations; these are shown in Table 1 for HS2 Phase 1 and Table 2 for HS2 Full Scheme.
[normal]44. While we would expect the magnitude of the Wider Economic Benefits to reduce as the core benefits decrease we have used HS2 Ltd figures without any change
[normal]45. As can be seen from the Tables 1 and 2 below, the BCRs for both Phase 1 and the Full scheme are at or below 1 even with WEIs included. As a consequence, the projects will destroy value, returning less than the cost of the investment. The true comparator figure is the loss of opportunity cost of not investing the money in projects with BCRs of 3 and above, including the HS2 alternatives. Negative £88 billion could well be the true cost of proceeding with HS2.

[normal]Business Passenger Long-distance Demand Forecasting[bold]46. As the DfT show in figure 2.1 of the Strategic case for HS2 (p.46), following 45 years of no growth, rail demand has grown significantly over the last 18 years. Based on passenger figures from the Office of the Rail Regulator (ORR) and estimates of the percent of business passengers from the National Travel Survey (NTS), the National Rail Travel Survey (NRTS) and the National Passenger Survey (NPS), business rail long distance travel has increased from 3.2bn km in 2002 to 4.8bn km in 2011 we have prepared the graph showing the growth of Business rail long distance in Billions of passenger km shown in Figure 5.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Figure 5. Business Rail Long Distance (Billion Passenger km)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]47. Over the same period and based on the ORR and NRTS data sources, total business rail travel has increased from 7.0bn km to 10.0bn km. The National Travel Survey shows very similar growth although it indicates a reduction in business distance travelled during the economic slump. Figure 6 shows both the Long Distance and the overall business rail growth.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Figure 6. Business Rail Total Distance  (Passenger kms Billion)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Strategic View
[normal]48. In order to take a strategic view it is crucial to set the long distance rail growth in the context of overall UK business travel. Since 1997, total business distance travelled has decreased from 67.8bn km to 58.9bn km in 2011; a 13% fall. The relatively small absolute growth in rail has come from the shift of passengers from other modes. 
[normal]Figure 7 provides a view of what is happening overall, not just in the rail sector.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Figure 7. UK Total business travel (Passenger kms Billion) and rails market share[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]49. Figure 8 
[normal]shows that between 1996 and 2006 real GDP growth was 40%. There was no increase in either business travel distance or the number of trips.
[normal] This 13% reduction has occurred during a period when the population has increased by 10%. Organisations have been able to reduce costs, emissions and the unproductive time wasting part of journeys by using Information Communication Technologies (ICT).  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Figure 8. All modes domestic business travel vs. GDP and Population. Indexed base 1 in 1996[bold]HS2 Ltd Passenger Forecasts
[normal]50. Previously in Figure 4 we have shown the HS2 Ltd forecast for Long Distance business passengers. In order to model the overall forecast and mode transfers HS2 Ltd have also forecast the growth in all rail business travel and air and road modes.
[normal]51. Although the NTS, NRTS and NPS survey data shows that the proportion of business travelers on long distance rail services is about 26%, the HS2 Ltd revised appraisal documents indicate that they have increased the business travelers from 28%, that they used in Aug 2012, to about 38%. This figure increases with the first phase of HS2 to 41% and further increases to 42% with the second phase. 
[normal]52. When added to the underlying demand forecasts and the demand increases predicted as a result of HS2, this causes a step increase of about 36% in 2010 (the model base year) and results in the 4.8bn km figure discussed previously rising to about 20 bn km by 2036. 
[normal]53. Figure 9 shows the past trends for long distance rail, total business rail and from the National Travel Survey overall all modes business travel. It also shows the HS2 Ltd implied forecasts for each of these categories. The growth for non-rail modes is on the high side, slightly above forecast population growth rather than slightly below as past trends show, however it is not completely unreasonable.
[normal]54. The model shows that there is very little mode transfer from road and air to rail going forward and consequently both the overall rail and the long distance rail growth forecasts are questionable. In particular the long distance forecast with its step change in assumptions in 2010, high growth rates and step changes in 2026 and 2033 is unreasonable.
[normal]Figure 9. Past business travel (Passenger kms Billion) and HS2 Ltd forecast for business LD rail, total rail and total all transport modes[bold]55. Bluespace Thinking has sought to understand the nature of the long distance business rail market and assess the size of the total market. The business rail market is predominantly a business-to-business market including internal business meetings and meeting with and between public service organisations, we think it is rare for business long distance travel to be related to end user meetings, financial or legal advisors meeting affluent individuals maybe the exception.
[normal]56. By deducting business to end user travel (e.g. police, ambulances and district nurse travel, sales and service visits etc.), travel for trade and distribution by vans (plumbers, royal mail etc) and air travel to non-mainland UK destinations, we estimate the size of the total relevant business-to-business market in which long distance rail operates to be about 25bn passenger km in 2011, which has declined from about 28bn km in 1996.
[normal]57. Figure 10 shows these past trends and HS2 implied forecasts in graphical form, indicating the reversal of the trend for the last 18 years and the substantial increase in long distance rail going from 20% market share in 2011 to 40% in 2036. Overall, rail travel is predicted to have 64% of the market suggesting either an error in the HS2 analysis or a phenomenal transfer and concentration of businesses to major urban areas.
[normal]Figure 10. Past trends and HS2 Ltd implied forecasts of the relevant business-to-business travel market (Billion Passenger km)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Economic consequences
[normal]58. The forecasts raise the question why businesses, particularly business services like KPMG and others, would focus 40% of their time, effort and cost on meetings with businesses that are in excess of 50 miles away (many over 100 miles given the proportion of journeys anticipated to be to and from London on HS2) rather than deal with businesses in their local areas unless they intend to reduce costs by closing local offices and serving customers from one or two major city locations like London.
[normal]59. In the event these forecasts were to occur, the added cost to businesses and public services valued in accordance with the HS2 Value of Time assumptions would be about 1.5 to 2 times the business user benefit savings attributable to time saved and would therefore be in excess of £60bn in Present Value terms, a sum that along with property blight has not been taken into account in the Wider Economic Impacts assessment. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Why has business travel declined?
[normal]60. The 52 largest UK employers account for about 20% of UK employment and many of them publish information about their corporate responsibility that explains their plans to reduce business travel, to reduce green house gas emissions and to reduce cost and improve efficiency. We have not found any evidence to suggest that any of these or the smaller organizations employing the other 80% are planning to substantially increase business travel beyond the rate of employee growth over the next 20 years. 
[normal]61. A classic error in market analysis and forecasting is to focus only on narrow market segments and not to understand what is happening overall. It is useful to look at the road “cars and vans” market to understand the nature and scope for growth in the rail business market. It is particularly important to understand the size of the total business-to-business travel market, as this is the primary business market that rail serves. 
[normal]62. End user domestic markets including insurance, banking and utilities, as well as the physical and productive markets like manufacturing, wholesale/retail, construction, agriculture and raw materials are dependant primarily on local physical travel, ICT and freight transport, as opposed to long distance passenger travel. As BA found with Concord, physical meetings between highly paid senior managers and directors of organisations are important but are not a large part of the overall business travel market.
[normal]63. One way to gain a vital and rich understanding of the market is with case studies. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Business Travel - Case studies[bold]Royal Mail[bold] accounts for about 220 million km of business travel, which they have reduced by about 5% during the last few years and are expecting further reductions. They serve a local physical market.
[normal]HMRC[bold] have set travel reduction targets and expect staff to use sustainable options, such as enhanced video and telephone-conferencing facilities to reduce business-travel footprint. Where travel is necessary there has been a shift from road and air to rail. 
[normal]As the UK’s largest employer, the 
[normal]NHS[bold] travel carbon footprint is the greatest at 3.2 MtCO2e. The NHS has a target to reduce emissions by 50% in 2025. Much of their business transport is for ambulances, district nurses and other health care professionals however administrative functions and inter-professional communications are moving to ICT solutions. The NHS represents about 7% of total UK business travel, however it is predominantly roads based local journeys. 
[normal]Research shows that 
[normal]BT[bold] employees are 20% more productive partly because they spend less time travelling. Those who use conferencing to avoid travel are significantly more productive; time worth £100 is saved every time travel to a meeting is avoided. In 2009/10 the company’s employees avoided more than 33 million kilometers of travel by using audio, video and web conferencing services.
[normal]Over 2 years the 
[normal]Department of Work and Pensions [bold]reduced their travel from about 170 million km to 80 million km by using ICT and stricter travel controls. They also switched from road and air to rail, however their actual rail travel has reduced by 65% over the period. 
[normal]The 
[normal]Department for Transport[bold] reduced their travel budget by about 20% in real terms between 2010/11 and 2012/13. DfT travel can be classified as business to business.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]64. The majority of business rail and air travel is business-to-business, however most road car and van travel is not; it is mostly serving local end user markets. Sewell’s research and insight 2013 Fleet 200 survey provides additional understanding of the extent that different business sectors engage in business travel.               
[normal]65. From the assessment of the case studies and Sewell’s Fleet 200 survey we note that about 50% of business road travel is carried out in vans. The business services sector, which is the main long distance rail market, represents about 17% of the current cars and vans market. This, along with the relatively small car portion of the Public sector market and the Finance and IT market which is primarily for local trips, represents about 15 Bn driver/passenger km and is the sector that has seen the greatest decline over the last 18 years.
[normal]66. Given this research, we find it implausible to think that the decline in business travel seen over the last 20 years will dramatically reverse and as it is not anticipated (by HS2 Ltd or anyone else) that rail will continue to take market share from road, there is no reason to believe that the rail growth seen over the last few years will continue, indeed the signs are already visible that the growth rate is declining.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal][4] The KPMG analysis of economic growth
[normal]Are the results reasonable?
[normal]67. If anyone is minded to believe the KPMG report, they will need to believe that each additional return business journey generated as a result of HS2 (about 20,000/ day according to HS2 Ltd forecasts) will produce £2700 added value with no additional skills, land or capital. Alternatively the £15bn comes from an increase in rail business journeys facilitated by released capacity. Given these journeys are so profitable it is surprising that businesses are choosing to cut back on business travel and becoming more efficient and profitable as a result. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Technical issues
[normal]68. In April 2010 Bluespace Thinking looked at the KPMG work carried out in 2009/2010 for the high-speed rail lobby group Greengauge 21, on which the more recent work is based. We have now also looked at the updated version of their work that has recently been paid for and published by HS2 Ltd.
[normal]69. In their original 2010 report KPMG stated that:
[normal]“…when used for forecasting, KPMG’s analysis therefore makes some implicit assumptions:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]70. Transport infrastructure is usually built to meet demand (or in the case of HS2 possibly “perceived” demand) and logic dictates that the direction of causal relationship is that business behavior leads to rail connectivity although there is probably some degree of two-way effect. 
[normal]71. The extent of rail connectivity in and to London is far higher than in other areas, and this, plus the fact that rail lines are built to provide access to cities, heavily impacts on the sort of analysis that KPMG have carried out. Rail connectivity and productivity are both correlated to a myriad of parameters including skills, percent of working age population, health, education qualifications, financial and services sector prevalence, and access to capital to name but a few. Therefore it is highly doubtful that these assumptions are correct.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Cross sectional versus longitudinal analysis 
[normal]72. As well as the technical criticisms that have been explained by the recognised experts and the fact that KPMG have assumed that there is no constraint on skills or land (a seemingly absurd notion when considering the centre of cities), from our reviews we think, but can not be absolutely sure, that the study is cross sectional in nature. That is to say it considers at a point in time the difference in productivity between locations with different transport connectivity and derives elasticities accordingly. 
[normal]73. It then assumes these elasticities are causal, assumes that the increase in business rail journeys predicted by HS2 Ltd is real and then predicts a huge £15bn/year increase in GVA (gross value added).
[normal]74. It is far more helpful to consider what is happening longitudinally, that is to say for a location look at its growth in GVA over time and its growth in business travel and assess that relationship. However, as can be seen from figure 8, this approach does cause a problem for the rail lobby as for the last 18 years the relationship is negative (i.e. as business travel goes down GDP goes up). Cost cutting in response to the slump in 2008 produced an additional drop in business travel that has partly reversed in 2012/13. We have looked at this at the regional level and found the same relationship to business travel across all regions, although we see the reverse with commuter and leisure travel. 
[normal]75. Increased GVA probably leads to increased leisure travel, for commuting we think the relationship is the other way, more commuters travelling to work probably leads to higher GVA. For business we think that over the last 18 years the reduction in business travel with its inherent increase in efficiency has been a contributor to increased GVA. 
[normal]76. This can be seen by comparing London, that has one of the lowest rates of business travel per employee, with Birmingham, that has one of the highest, as London business travel has decreased the GVA has gone up faster, in Birmingham business travel reduction has been a lot less and its GVA growth has been a lot slower.
[normal]Comparison with HS1
[normal]77. Recently Michael Heseltine has quoted the consultants predictions of GVA increase made for HS1 at the time of its construction, suggesting a £10bn benefit. Table 3 shows Office of National Statistics (ONS) data of GVA for the South East and Outer London. Kent has two HS1 stations but the growth is below the average, Medway and Outer London E/NE, both have the next best access to HS1 stations, their growth is very low compared to the average. The data does not support the assertions made for HS1 or the forecasts produced by KMPG for HS2. Redevelopment of the St Pancras area has clearly provided an economic benefit for that area.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]78. The overall impact of high-speed long distance travel on the economy needs further study, but based on our assessment we are confident that the KPMG figure is a gross exaggeration of what will occur if HS2 proceeds. If it were reduced to 10% it would equate reasonably well to the HS2 Ltd prediction of £26bn for the present value of the full scheme without wider economic benefits. However, given the flaws we have found in those calculations, if our assessments of the adjustments required are correct the figure becomes negative £14bn present value that may well match with a longitudinal assessment of the relationship of productivity to business travel.

[normal][5] The role of rail and civil engineering lobbyists
[normal]Chronology of events
[normal]79. Nov 2005[bold] - Greengauge21 was formed to promote HSR in the UK
[normal] 
[normal]“We have set up Greengauge21 as a ‘not for profit’ organisation to research and develop the concept of a high speed rail (HSR) network, and to promote its implementation as a national economic priority”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]80. May 2006[bold] - The Institution of Civil Engineers publish a paper supporting an HSR scheme.
[normal]81. Dec 2006[bold] - The Independent Eddington Transport Study concludes 
[normal]that the UK's transport network is broadly adequate, connecting the right places, so the Government does not need to worry about building new infrastructure such as high-speed rail links and cross-country motorways, but should instead concentrate on improving existing road and rail networks.
[normal]82. Dec 2006[bold] - The Strategic Rail Authority SRA (the original proponents of the HSR scheme) was disbanded. Two directors of the SRA have gone on to lobby for HSR and have significant influence on the progress of HS2.
[normal]83. March 2007[bold] - MVA Consultancy report to the DfT that the rail demand elasticities being used for long distance rail are unreasonably high and should be reduced. These are the basis of the passenger demand forecast and the reason Government has prioritized long distance rail for investment. Successive Secretaries of State for Transport have declined to approve changes to reduce the elasticities until August 2012 when new guidance was issued. 
[normal]84. June 2007[bold] - Greengauge21 propose HS2.
[normal]85. Jan 2009[bold] - Lord Adonis as Minister for Transport (train enthusiast) formed HS2 Ltd with the remit to bring forward a proposal for the fastest HSR scheme possible. Two members of the Strategic Rail Authority, the founder of Greengage21 and other HSR advocates were appointed to the HS2 Strategic advisory panel. Adonis met with Pete Waterman (record producer and train enthusiast) at this time and Waterman was appointed in 2013 to the HS2 Growth task force.
[normal]86. Sept 2009[bold] - Greengauge21 put forward “A high speed rail strategy for Britain”.
[normal]87. Dec 2009[bold] - HS2 Ltd report to Government on their HS2 proposals.
[normal]88. Feb 2010[bold] - Greengauge21 publish work by KPMG, MVA Consultancy and Systra promoting HSR. The work was based on the exaggerated demand forecasts that were known to be flawed.
[normal]89. March 2010[bold] - The DfT and HS2 Ltd published their proposals for HS2 that looked remarkably similar to the Greengauge21 work and had many of the same flaws.
[normal]90. Aug/Sept 2010[bold] - For undisclosed reasons HS2 Ltd replace Atkins with MVA as consultant for the demand forecasting, they go on to produce further demand forecasts which still include the flawed assumptions.
[normal]91. June 2011[bold] - During the HS2 consultation the ICE came out strongly in favour of HS2 although the membership debate and support was divided. The company that employed three members of the ICE management panel was awarded HS2 Ltd engineering contracts in August 2012.
[normal]92. July 2012[bold] - Following a dinner between Secretary of State Phillip Hammond and transport industry representatives Prof. David Begg, previously at the Strategic Rail Authority and director of the First group, formed the lobby group “Yes to HSR”. They employ Westbourne Communications as their PR consultants to promote the lobby “like a political campaign”. Subsequently the DfT employ Westinghouse as their PR consultants presumably with the same remit.
[normal]93. July 2013[bold] - Passenger Focus put forward passenger survey results for the mainline long distance services, which showed that business passengers make up about 26% of the demand.
[normal]94. Oct 2013[bold] - HS2 Ltd publish the KPMG report on the economic impacts of HS2. It has been referred to as independent but is based on the Greengauge21 2009 work. It produces overall benefits about 10 times greater than recognised evaluation techniques which themselves are over stated.
[normal]95. Oct 2013[bold] - HS2 Ltd issued a revised Economic case in which they have corrected some of the previously identified flaws. However it would appear that based on a new view of the relationship between ticket types and business travel they have raised the proportion of business travelers on HS2 from 28% as used in August 2012, to about 36%-40%.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]DfT and HS2 Ltd consultants and “independent” advice
[normal]96. From the chronology and from other information, it appears that the DfT have abandoned Eddington’s independent study and have been led in their assessment of the strategic direction for rail by the HSR industry lobby, selectively appointing the consultants that first worked for Greengauge21 to also carry out the official evaluations. Even at a minimum consequence, this means that they have not had independent advice which even standing alone is a huge flaw for the DfT. 
[normal]97. Following on from this, it also brings into question their adherence to the Nolan principles particularly with regard to Integrity and Objectivity:
[normal]“Holders of public office should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside individuals or organisations that might seek to influence them in the performance of their official duties”
[normal]“In carrying out public business, including making public appointments, awarding contracts, or recommending individuals for rewards and benefits, holders of public office should make choices on merit
[normal]”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal][6] Moving forward 
[normal]98. HS2 has created more divided opinion than any investment decision in recent years. On the one side experienced politicians and successful business people have come out strongly against HS2 saying that it does not make strategic sense and the economic case is unsound others have come out in favour. If it is not to remain an instrument of division over the next 20 or so years there needs to be a coming together of views based on an independent assessment of the facts and the evidence. The UK cannot afford to make such decisions based on opinion and dogma; the project should not be continued without a full assessment being carried out. The approach being used by the Davies Airports Commission sets both a president and a blueprint of how the assessment of HSR could move forward.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]99. The key issue in deciding whether to reassess the analytical work is dependant on the opinion held about the work to date: Is it reliable? Is it accurate? Has it been influenced by vested interests? Are those that have carried it out the best qualified? Are they independent? The Transport Select Committee has decided to re-evaluate HS2 in part because of the controversy over the recent KPMG report, but this it not the only aspect of the case of which questions need to be answered.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]100. The Davies Airports Commission have been meticulous in their avoidance of situations where there is a potential conflict of interest, while on HS2 the DfT and HS2 Ltd seem to have actively embraced advisors, both individuals and companies, who will benefit if the project goes ahead. This is why there is so much controversy; it is not an issue that can be brushed aside, it is NOT going to just “go away”.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Important questions that cannot be ignored 
[normal](101)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Final Conclusions
[normal]102. To be fair to the DfT and HS2 Ltd and their respective professional staffs their latest analysis has corrected a number of the flaws that have been previously identified. However they, or someone, appear to have then substituted new flaws creating the same answer which is encapsulated in the Grengauge21 manifesto as published in 2006:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“…to research and develop the concept of a high speed rail (HSR) network, and (to) promote its implementation as a national economic priority…”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]103. To conclude, there has been no proper assessment of the issues to be resolved, as well as poor development of alternatives and a complete lack of evaluation of the best option. Further work on HS2 should be cancelled or suspended and an independent review carried out that reassesses the capacity issues to be resolved, develops alternatives and makes a proper evaluation based on evidence and sound analytical methodology. Consultants that have been contracted by Greengauge21 or carried out pro bono work on their behalf as part of the rail industry lobby effort should be excluded from involvement in the work.
