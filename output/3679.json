"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written Evidence from the Home Office [CST0021]&#xa0;Thank you for your invitation to submit evidence to the Committee's inquiry into crime statistics\n.\nI am replying as the Chief Statistician and Head of Profession for Statistics in the Home Office on behalf of my teams and our colleagues. The Committee has asked six specific questions about crime statistics. These questions and your inquiry are focused on police recorded crime statistics. We believe it is for the police service, Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and the Office of National Statistics to additionally give their opinions on much of what you ask. Attached is the Home Office response to those questions.  \nWe believe it is very important to highlight that crime statistics are not based on police recorded crime alone. Rather they are formed by gathering together that police data and presenting it alongside the results from the Crime Survey of England and Wales (formerly the British Crime Survey).  The survey reflects the experiences of victims, regardless of whether they have reported crimes to the police. As a result we do not rely on one source in isolation with policy makers using them in conjunction. It is only by using the two sources alongside each other that their true value can be unlocked.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction&#xa0;The committee has asked the following specific questions and our responses are shown below.&#xa0;Are crimes being recorded by the police when they should be? Are crimes being categorised correctly? &#xa0;What are the factors which can influence police mis-recording of crime? &#xa0;\n&#xa0;Are the right checks in place to ensure that the systems for recording crime function effectively and accurately?  &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Has enough been done to ensure the integrity of crime data? What more should be done?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTo what extent can policy-makers have confidence in the statistics which result from the recording of crime by police forces? &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nShould recorded crime statistics be classified as national statistics?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
