"&#xa0;\nRegulatory Reform Committee – Written evidence&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“\nin\n proposing a strengthened scrutiny procedure in any future Bill the Government should normally use an existing model rather than creating a new variation; and they should explain the basis for the decision. If the Government exceptionally take the view that it is necessary to create yet another variation rather than using an existing statutory scrutiny procedure, the reasons should be set out clearly in the Explanatory Notes to the Bill and in the delegated powers memorandum.”\n&#xa0;\nGiven that there are eleven existing strengthened statutory scrutiny procedures, why has the Government sought to introduce another, separate procedure through the draft Bill? Is this proportionate? Could an existing statutory scrutiny procedure be used instead?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nRegulatory Reform Committee\n&#xa0;\n11 October 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nThe Regulatory Reform Committee (previously the Deregulation and Regulatory Reform Committee) is appointed to consider and report to the House on draft Legislative Reform Orders under the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006.
