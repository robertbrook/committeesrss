[normal]y School is a school in a
[normal] deprived area of Tilbury.  The junior school
[normal] had  previously been in an Ofsted category but the infant school was classed as good. The headteacher of the infant school became the headteacher of the amalgamated primary school but over this time had cancer and was away from school for most of a year f
[normal]ollowing surgery
[normal] and chemotherapy
[normal].  Coming back from this and handing the amalgamation
[normal] of these
[normal] challenging schools she had the further challenge of Gateway specifically targeting her year 5 pupils to move to Gateway in year 6. Parents were told at Gateway
[normal] meetings that if they did not move children to the school they would be unlikely to get a place there. The only other secondary school within walking distance had just failed its Ofsted. Parents who were among the most concerned about their child’s second
[normal]ary schooling were most likely to take this action
[normal] and their
[normal] children were often those who were already working at level four or higher. A number of local schools including Manor, Lansdowne, Chadwell St Mary, Woodside, East Tilbury and Little Thurrock were
[normal] affected but Manor and Lansdowne most of all.
[normal]With no support from its local secondary school and questionable support from the LA Manor Primary was failed by Ofsted this summer. However,
[normal] recently released p
[normal]rimary school league tables show 
[normal]that the Gatewa
[normal]y Free School has scored significantly less than Manor Primary on a number of key measures.   Only 66% of Gateway children gained the expected level 4 in reading, writing a
[normal]nd mathematics compared to 70% 
[normal]at Manor and 
[normal]72%
[normal] for Thurrock as a whole.
[normal]Manor is cu
[normal]rrently being forced to become a sponsored academy as part of the Gateway group with the principal of the Gateway who contributed to its demise now as CEO. It has 
[normal]subsequently been
[normal] decided
[normal] that the Manor KS2 children will be moved on block to the Gateway F
[normal]ree School. Manor will continue as an infant school and become primary again in the future but with a reduced size. 
[normal]Lansdowne
[normal] 
[normal]School
[normal] is also being reduced by a form of entry. Clearly these actions are being put in place to fill the free school and create t
[normal]he illusion it was needed. It is not being filled as free schools are intended to be
[normal],
[normal] by parents who have made a free choice of it as a preferred school.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]The Free School results were
[normal] presumably
[normal] poor because t
[normal]he techniques that 
[normal]made Gateway Sec
[normal]ondary so a
[normal]pparently successful:
[normal] early and repeated entry to examina
[normal]tions and m
[normal]odules and 
[normal]entering children
[normal] for 
[normal]easier 
[normal]so-
[normal]called “equivalent” diplomas are not 
[normal]available in the primary sector. 
[normal]In primary schools c
[normal]hildren
[normal] all 
[normal]sit the same test on the same day and it gets sent away to be marked. Except 
[normal]of course 
[normal]for the new writing assessment which was the teachers’ 
[normal]own 
[normal]appraisal of children’s work th
[normal]r
[normal]ough the year and which
[normal],
[normal] surprise, surprise, Gateway did rather better at.
