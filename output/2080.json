"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Institute of Ergonomics and Human Factors – Written evidence&#xa0;The Institute of Ergonomics and Human Factors makes the following response the Government's Call for Consultation on the Draft Deregulation Bill:\n&#xa0;\nThe proposal to exempt some self-employed people from health and safety legislation&#xa0;\nThe proposal to exempt some self-employed people from health and safety legislation will we believe significantly and negatively impact the management of risk across a range of industrial and business settings.\n&#xa0;\nWithin the current draft legislation self-employed people will be exempt from the Health and Safety at Work Act if they can demonstrate they do not conduct 'a relevant undertaking'.  Where an undertaking is a 'relevant undertaking' if either it is a prescribed description (i.e. on an undefined list) or there is a possibility that a third party could be put at risk.\n&#xa0;\nThe only way under this proposed change that a self-employed person could assure themselves that they are exempt from the revised Health and Safety at Work Act is to complete a Risk Assessment in an approved format and if there are no plausible risks to a third party identified and the work they are doing is not on the current version of the prescribed description list.  Then fingers crossed they are exempt.  This is too open-ended.\n&#xa0;\nThe problem is that there are a large number of self-employed businesses where the applicability of the H&amp;S Act will depend on the specific work being done minute to minute.  There are also a large number of cases where self-employed people work collaboratively with others and with other businesses.  In these and other scenarios, defining where responsibilities lie for the health and safety of each and all will be a legal minefield.\n&#xa0;\nTo avoid the confusion that this draft change to the Health and Safety Act would make, we would suggest that if the government wishes to proceed with implementing this recommendation from the \nLofstedt\n Report, then self-employed people should be able to register their business as exempt if they can demonstrate that, in conducting their work, they cannot place third parties at risk.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe remaining changes proposed in the Draft BillThe IEHF has no comment to offer on these.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Consultation QuestionsThe IEHF has no comment to offer on these.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
