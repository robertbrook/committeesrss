[[[Digital makes good things happen.]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Introduction]]]

[[[ ]]]Virgin Media welcomes the continuing parliamentary interest and opportunity to respond to the Committee’s inquiry into the issue of online safety. As a responsible ISP, providing broadband services to more than 4 million homes and families, Virgin Media puts the issue of internet safety above all others in terms of importance. Debates about these complex issues can often be dominated – on both sides - by a small group of stakeholders with strongly held views. Often the voice of the ordinary consumer has been lost. In this consultation, Virgin Media aims to set online safety in the context of the views of the average UK internet user.

[[[&#xa0;]]]Virgin Media’s customers, and the UK public, believe in the internet as a force for economic, societal, educational and personal progress. Overwhelmingly, they believe that digital makes good things happen. &#xa0;Naturally, as consumers they think first about how the internet has empowered them with more product information, comparison and lower prices. But beyond their pockets, our customers tell us they believe in the wider good of digital to strengthen family bonds, contribute to business growth, and enrich their child’s education. &#xa0;They come to that view despite the vast majority of public debate about the impact of the internet on their daily lives focusing on the dangers not the benefits of being online.&#xa0;Of course, those dangers are often very real, serious and demand vigilance from all users if the benefits of the internet are to be enjoyed free from harm. &#xa0;Our role as a responsible ISP is first and foremost, to encourage that vigilance by educating our customers about where risks do lie, and providing them with the tools to combat those risks how they see fit. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]Positively, through education we are seeing that our customers’ awareness and vigilance against online risks is becoming increasingly sophisticated. There are understandably knowledge gaps given the subject matter is fast evolving technology, but parents identify a broad range of risks, beyond just the content available online, to include the people their children meet and the personal information that they and their children share. &#xa0;As a result, our customers adopt approaches to online safety that best suit the needs and maturity of their families – and they see it as fundamentally their choice as to how they go about that. That often includes applying parental controls, but also involves proactive digital parenting such as putting in place rules around where in the home the internet is used, monitoring usage, and, crucially, having conversations with their children about online safety. &#xa0;The recent tenor of debate about the online world has failed to reflect the generally positive view that the UK public have about digital and their pro-activity in managing online risks they might encounter. Inevitably, this has led to largely reactive, sometimes knee-jerk policy making in recent months. &#xa0;Virgin Media is hopeful that moving forward, the parameters and expectations that Government have already set industry in relation to online safety will remain firm and clear, and that future policy is developed in a sober, evidence-based way, taking account of the overwhelming view of the UK public that digital is a force for good. &#xa0;With that in mind, Virgin Media sees three key challenges for Government: &#xa0;

[[[First]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[to provide certainty to ISPs that an ‘active choice’ approach to parental controls remains the most proportionate, effective way of engaging parents with online safety, and continue to give ISP technical flexibility over the solutions they implement. ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Our customers views about Online Safety.]]]&#xa0;Throughout 2012 Virgin Media engaged in a national listening exercise – Our Digital Future www.ourdigitalfuture.co.uk – to understand how our customers and British consumers felt about their lives online. Over 3,000 people were asked about the practicalities of their digital habits – hours spent online, their preferences for content and access – but more deeply, what their reactions were to the growing debate about the balance of risks and responsibilities on the internet. &#xa0;They were asked about their views on a broad range of online behaviours and risks -access to adult content; sharing of personal data; exposure to malware; piracy – and where they see the balance of responsibilities in protecting children from those risks between themselves, their ISP, and the state.&#xa0;In summary, we found a UK public that is engaged with the issue of online safety, aware of a range of risks, and confident in taking the actions appropriate for their families to manage those risks in order to make the most of the internet. &#xa0;

[[[Behaviours and risks]]]

[[[ ]]]Reflecting the predominant view of the internet’s impact on society as overwhelmingly positive, UK parents are generally very comfortable with their children’s online behaviour.  &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Source: OFCOM Media Literacy Report]]]&#xa0;Policy makers might conclude that this reflects ignorance or naivety to the realities of online risk amongst parents. However, evidence points to high levels of activism amongst parents, suggesting that their confidence is borne out of a firm view that they have created the right environment for their children to get the most out of the internet.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;In reality, parents have a relatively granular understanding of online risk and can identify a wide range of potentially dangerous channels. As might be expected given the direction of recent public debate, pornography ranks highest as the content that parents are most concerned about their child having access to. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Question: Which sites give you most cause for concern?]]]&#xa0;However, access to adult content is only one of a number of concerns for parents. Clearly, there is considerable concern amongst parents about the risks presented to their children through exposure to people they don’t know online (so-called stranger danger). In fact, when asked to directly compare risk associated with different types of online activity – as opposed to ranking different types of content – parents registered more concern in relation to stranger danger than exposure to content.  

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;Whilst generally parents have a reasonably sophisticated understanding of online risk, there are gaps in their awareness and understanding. &#xa0;In part these gaps relate to technological developments that many parents do not fully understand. For instance, whilst in general, parents are well aware of the threats posed by malware and viruses to online safety – 70% of customers understand the risks associated with malware – there is limited understanding of how that risk extends to mobile, where only 32% are concerned about the impact of malware.  &#xa0;Other knowledge gaps relate to a lack of exposure to certain types of behaviour.  Whilst there is research pointing to high levels of concern about cyber-bullying amongst parents, there was a significant disjunction between levels of exposure to cyber-bullying amongst the parents and children that we surveyed. 47% of children have had some direct experience of cyber-bullying versus 18% of adults with children under 18. &#xa0;Parents not only identify a variety of risks but in turn adopt a variety of different approaches to digital parenting, reflecting the fact that content filtering – for instance – addresses only one of a range of online risks. A recent comparison of parental mediation strategies across the EU found that the UK has the second highest proportion of parents adopting “All Rounder” approaches to their child’s internet safety ie. a heterogeneous mix of active monitoring and restrictive technical measures. &#xa0;

[[[Responsibilities ]]]In light of the many approaches and activism of UK digital parents, it comes as no surprise that they see themselves as having greatest responsibility for protecting their children online, and are not comfortable with one-size-fits-all approaches imposed by their ISP or the state.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;That is not to suggest that ISPs, or indeed the state, have no role to play in supporting parents to create a safe environment for their children online. Indeed when asked a slightly different question – who has some (rather than greatest) responsibility for online safety – parents clearly identify ISPs, schools, central Government and other internet companies as all having a role to play. First and foremost, that role begins with establishing processes in partnership with law enforcement that allow for the removal of illegal content at source.  Beyond illegal content, ISPs have the responsibility to use all of their technical expertise to advise parents of the risks and realities of online life, and make available easy to use tools that can support their digital parenting. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Our role in delivering a safer internet.]]]&#xa0;Virgin Media, as an ISP governed by the EU Telecommunications Framework and E-Commerce Directive, has no regulated responsibility to block consumer access to any content. However we exercise three core responsibilities to help create a safe environment for internet users:&#xa0;&#xa0;There is an important and clear distinction between the voluntarily, proactive approach that Virgin Media adopts in collaboration with law enforcement to remove content that they judge to be illegal versus our view on where responsibility lies for accessing legal content. Virgin Media believes that it is for adult internet users to decide whether they or their family can access legal content. Virgin Media is therefore strongly of the view that the industry-led and Government-supported approach to parental controls for legal content, which places the decision in parents hands, reflects the right balance of responsibilities.  &#xa0;

[[[Child abuse, terrorist and virus-containing material]]]

[[[ ]]]Virgin Media has a zero tolerance policy on the availability of child abuse material (CAM) online, so we take the following steps to help remove it from the internet:&#xa0;&#xa0;In relation to terrorism content Virgin Media has worked with law enforcement on a voluntary basis to:&#xa0;&#xa0;In relation to content that impacts on the security of our network or our customers’ personal data, such as malware, Virgin Media has worked with law enforcement on a voluntary basis to: &#xa0;&#xa0;Whether dealing with child abuse, terrorism and virus-containing material, Virgin Media is highly reliant on the expertise and legal footing of law enforcement bodies to make judgements on what action should be taken in response to a particular type of illegal content. Whilst Virgin Media takes proactive steps to minimise the harm of these forms of content, we do not do so unilaterally or without the oversight of law enforcement. In Virgin Media’s opinion, efforts to limit exposure to these extreme forms of content are best targeted at removal of the content at source, by the host. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Parental controls]]]

[[[ ]]]Virgin Media believes that parental controls can provide one set of tools for parents to help limit harms associated with children accessing adult content online. However, no technological solution is ever infallible, and so it is important that parents see parental controls as just one of a range of things that they must do to create a safe environment for their children online. Virgin Media:&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Education and awareness]]]

[[[ ]]]Our responsibility does not stop with providing the tools to block access to content. Nor would that be sufficient to meeting the range of challenges that children face online – covering not just what they see, but who they meet and what they share. To adequately meet a challenge of this scale, parents first and foremost must be aware of all of the potential risks that their child encounters and need to be engaged in continuing, active, digital parenting. Virgin Media therefore believes that the absolute priority of all online safety stakeholders should be to provide clear advice to parents on the risks their children face online and the steps they can take to ensure their children stay safe. In meeting that priority, Virgin Media:&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[A role for Government.]]]&#xa0;Virgin Media welcomes the current focus and scrutiny of efforts to deliver a safe internet for children. However, the overwhelmingly negative tenor of recent debate on the subject has not reflected the views of the average UK parent on the digital world, nor the steps that parents, ISPs, Government and other stakeholders are already taking to ensure that children are able to reap all of the benefits that the internet offers in safety. As a result, the direction of policy in this important area has been largely reactive, sometimes knee-jerk, in recent months. &#xa0;Virgin Media is hopeful that moving forward, the parameters and expectations that Government have already set industry in relation to online safety will remain firm and clear, and that future policy is developed in a sober, evidence-based way, taking account of the overwhelming view of the UK public that digital is a force for good.  &#xa0;With that in mind, Virgin Media sees three key challenges for Government. &#xa0;

[[[First]]]

[[[ ]]]the message from parents is clear – they expect to be in control of setting the rules for their child’s life online. ‘Active choice’ is a better vehicle for delivering that than default filtering. 

[[[Government should provide certainty to ISPs that an ‘active choice’ approach to parental controls remains the most proportionate, effective way of engaging parents with online safety, and continue to give ISP technical flexibility over the solutions they implement. ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Second]]]

[[[ ]]]filtering is part of the solution to delivering a safe online environment for children but not the whole solution. A robust response to this wide ranging challenge requires vigilant, well informed, and active digital parents. 

[[[Government should focus its efforts on driving engagement amongst parents in these issues through clear advice and education, delivered through evidence-based means that demonstrate behavioural impact.]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Third]]]

[[[ ]]]child abuse is a deep routed societal problem, of which distribution of, and access to, that material online is arguably both a symptom and a driver. The ISP community is therefore committed to ridding the internet of that content – an ongoing, considerable challenge. Virgin Media believes
