default1 ;   With regard to the customer, and the Country, a very definite No.
defaultWe have long abandoned our indigenous energy resource, coal, and handed over our oil and gas reserves to the developers. Apart from a minimal tax on each barrel they remove, we then have to buy back the oil at the world market spot price. The same is likely to happen to “Fracked” gas, as it will be considered to be European, and the developer’s property.
defaultInward investment in “renewables” is only sustained by heavy subsidies. Their erratic and variable contribution to the National Grid makes matching supply to demand more and more challenging as their numbers increase. Inefficient, but flexible, generators have to be running alongside the renewables to maintain a stable 50 Hts speed. The consequences of this is a release of CO2 into the atmosphere, mitigating most of the savings made by the, so-called, CO2 free renewables. 
default&#xa0;
default2:  Wind and Solar energy is not suitable for connection to the National Grid, until, and if, large scale storage of electricity can be developed. Otherwise, they should be confined to private use only, and carry no subsidy.
defaultOther renewables should be explored. Geothermal, wave and tidal. We have an abundance of coal, but I suspect that this too will not be ours, and will go to the highest bidder. The developer will be the beneficiary.
defaultThe Severn tidal barrage proposal has long been looked at. Like wind energy it is dependent on  a variable, albeit, predictable tidal flow. It means that maximum output will not be coincident with maximum demand most of the time.  The huge inward investment required would be disproportionate to benefit, with the cost imposed on customers bills.
defaultWe should be concentrating on the efficient use of fossil fuels. CHP should be the norm, and all the waste heat that would otherwise go into the sea, river, or into the atmosphere, be utilised for horticulture. Even some of the combustion CO2 could be reduced by photosynthesis. The rest by carbon capture.
default&#xa0;
default3:  Success should be measured by the reduction in costs imposed on customers.
default&#xa0;
default4:  It appears not to be. All the wind turbines we have are only equivalent to half a Power Station.
default&#xa0;
default5:  Private sector investment means “inward investment” encouraged by high, and long term subsidies. All imposed on the consumer. This money drains out of the country to these foreign investors. Do EDF’s French customers have the same costs and subsidies imposed on them for Nuclear energy?
default&#xa0;
default6:  I suggest that it be dedicated to efficient, clean, fossil burn developments. Nuclear is yet another import, at heavy cost to the Nation, to meet our “obligations”, paid for through customers bills. This level of investment would do much to revive British  engineering, and manufacture.
default&#xa0;
default7:  Within Europe, Germany is suffering badly from its long term renewables schemes. It has the most expensive energy prices in Europe. Big companies are having to be subsidised. Medium, and small, sized companies are becoming uncompetitive. Exodus to the Far East is under way. 
defaultAmerica is in recovery, as new found reserves of gas 
defaultisdefault American, with costs plummeting. We must be able to declare our reserves to be British if we to wish to recover a place in the world.
defaultFrance still has a Nationalised electricity industry. EDF, and, together with the German Utilities, have acquired much of the British energy Industry.
defaultOur CO2 “obligations”, and carbon tax, must be revisited, or we will risk terminal decline.
defaultThere is a hidden cost to a “competitive” market. The many thousands of people employed as Traders, and in customer sales.

defaultSupplementary Paper
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are, alas, where we are.
default&#xa0;
defaultOur contribution to reducing CO2 was achieved in the 1980’s and 90’s when ‘we’ abandoned our Industrial heritage in manufacture. Many decades of enterprise were lost.
default&#xa0;
defaultUp until the 1970’s the demand for electricity doubled every 10 years  So savaged was our Industry subsequently, that this hunger for power was stopped, and is now declining. 
default To want to keep reducing our demand for electricity post deindustrialisation is shear folly. We have more than done our bit.
defaultWhat we have done is to move Industry overseas, together with our CO2 production.
defaultIn that 30 years or so our skills base has been allowed to drain away into retirement, without any thought given to the passing on of these many skills. Skills at all levels.
defaultWe have been so depleted that the German engineering company Siemens, say that we no longer have the skills to erect one of their Power Stations, let alone make one! This is the company that was allowed to buy out C.A. Parsons and NEA, Northern Electrical Industries, laid off the workforce and dismantled the factories, ridding themselves of a competitor. We, the Government, did nothing to stop this.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt will be decades before we could compete, again, with the Germans, or the French, or Far Eastern Companies, even with the will to do so, and we would certainly need much more competitively priced energy.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are currently geared to a downward spiral. This can only lead to increased poverty, tensions, and conflict. We have discarded our work force. Imported goods have to be paid for. We are even importing our coal! - not to mention most of our food. National Health, and other social benefits, will not be affordable. Beveridge’s concept depended on full employment.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have lost our Industry by deliberate acts that led on to unforeseen consequences (I hope).  Our Utilities have been lost to foreign owners. You suggest that this was as a consequence of strict compliance with European and International requirements. The French retain a Nationalised electricity provider, EDF.
default&#xa0;
defaultBeing dependent on foreign suppliers leaves us extremely vulnerable. Investment in new plant has to be paid for by customers or subsidised by Tax payers, who happen to be the same people. They also demand a “Strike” price for up to 40 years. They simply cannot loose. Until we are no longer able to afford our Bills! The “Big Six” threaten us with blackouts and power cuts if we do not pay them adequately.
defaultThe Big Six, and National Grid, are the fragmented remains of the CEGB, the Central Electricity Generating Board. This organisations priority was security of supply, and maintained 30% reserve capacity. Not the 1% or 2% now provided. They also provided the cheapest electricity in Europe, with the exception of Norway, and using the dearest fuel.
default&#xa0;
defaultSo-called Inward Investment for our Utilities is simply paid for by the customers, as it ever was. But profits, and subsidies, are not returned into investment.
default&#xa0;
defaultI understand that Power companies now want to import dozens of large diesel generating units to support our “Renewables”.
default&#xa0;
defaultProfits and Subsidies go overseas, while Tax to the British Government is minimum.
default&#xa0;
defaultRegulation, set up for all the Utilities at Privatisation, was wholly inadequate. What is best in the interests of their customers should have come first. Healthy development of the Companies would have followed.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the meantime we “fiddle” with Smart meters (imported?), at vast expense to consumers, in a vague attempt to constrain domestic usage. More imaginative, and efficient use of fuel should be developed, including CHP, and with intensive food production. 90% efficiency should be aimed at. This is the way to reduce CO2.
defaultWe should also be developing Thorium Nuclear Reactors that are inherently safe, and not commit ourselves to older generation, French, Reactors that produce ever more plutonium.  Our aim should be to do all this for ourselves.
