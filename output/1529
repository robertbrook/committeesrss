&#xa0;[bold]              [bold]              [bold]LG[bold]P[bold] 07[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Written submission from the Commissioning Joint Committee (LG[bold]P[bold] 07)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Who we are [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]01[bold]              [bold]The 
[normal]Commissioning Joint Committee[bold] comprises members of organisations representing all the disciplines involved in the commissioning of local authority work and services.  We publish guides to many aspects of commissioning, particularly those posing problems needing input from a range of disciplines. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]02[bold]              [bold]The CJC is sponsored by CIPFA but is an independent body, does not accept funding from any source, and meets all its expenses from the sale of CJC guides.  Our website is at
[normal]www.cipfa.org/Policy-and-Guidance/Technical-Panels-and-Boards/Commissioning-Joint-Committee 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Why we are responding to the Select Committee[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]03[bold]              
[normal]We are responding because the Select Committee has asked penetrating questions which we often ask
[normal] 
[normal]too.  All the questions deserve serious consideration and we offer our own answers.  We would have no objection to our response being copied to whatever other parties the Select Committee thinks fit.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Format[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]04[bold]              
[normal]The Committee asks six questions.  We reproduce all six, in italics, followed in each case by our own reply.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q1  To what extent is local government procurement organised to deliver value for money and social, economic and environmental objectives, including stimulating the local economy ?  To what extent are local authorities achieving the involvement of local residents in delivering value for money ?  To what extent are local authorities able to develop long-term relationships with contractors ?  [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Delivering value for money [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]05[bold]              [bold]It has to be accepted that VFM is not the only, or even the main, objective of public sector procurement.  In 2011 we conducted, jointly with the Association of Public Sector Excellence, an opinion survey of practitioners in local government, and received 1700 responses.  One question was whether practitioners think public sector procurement methods are intended to deliver three 
[normal]objectives, which we list below.  Replies indicated that (by short heads) more practitioners see the
[normal] need to demonstrate probity and non-discrimination than value for money as drivers of procurement methods.  Those agreeing were
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]% [bold]probity
[normal]91.9
[normal]no discrimination against EU 
[normal]tenderers
[normal]90.2
[normal]value for money
[normal]86.9
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]06[bold]              [bold]We do not want to make too much of the 
[normal]sequence
[normal] of these three drivers; so let’s call them first equal.  But it is still clear that local authorities have to look for ways of delivering value for money that do not stop them demonstrating probity and non-discrimination.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]07[bold]              [bold]The need to demonstrate probity has been a powerful factor in local government, at least since the introduction of district auditors in 1841.  Its power derives from the need for anybody spending other people’s money to keep good records showing what they spent it on, and why.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]08[bold]              [bold]CCT, the EU procurement rules, the best value regime and Freedom of Information have all required more and more disclosure.  But, as often happens to disclosure rights, the various people exercising them often assert that the bodies questioned have to make decisions in such a way that they can be explained, even if this restricts the choices available.  This assertion is of course incorrect; the law does not require parties answering questions to convince others that their decisions were right; the onus is on others to show that these decisions were wrong.  This assertion by questioners is however ineradicable, and all too many practitioners give in to it.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]09[bold]              [bold]Private citizens spending their own money, and to a great extent private sector bodies, do not have to explain their actions in this way.  They are free within the law to make up their own minds about what is best for themselves.  Public sector practitioners on the other hand have to keep ‘ease of explanation’ in mind in all their decision-making, and devote prime thinking-time to it.             
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Delivering social, economic and environmental objectives [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]10[bold]              [bold]Virtually all local government procurement has always been for the purpose of one or other social, economic or environmental objectives under statutory duties.  Since 2000 local authorities have also had power to pursue these objectives in such a way as to secure 
[normal]any other
[normal] social, economic or environmental objectives at the same time, either as add-ons or as side effects.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11[bold]              [bold]Meanwhile budgets for performing statutory duties have been steadily reduced.  It would therefore demand explanation if authorities were now to choose to spend a significant proportion of their diminishing budgets on add-on objectives for which they have powers, but not duties or budgets; or to reorganise their procurement for this specific purpose.    
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Delivering stimulation of the local economy [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]12[bold]              [bold]Economic regeneration
[normal] is one of the few powers for which authorities have for years had budgets, and which they continue to pursue.  Organising procurement to 
[normal]stimulate the local economy
[normal] does however mean something different; it means spending money whenever possible 
[normal]locally rather than elsewhere
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13[bold]              [bold]There is however an impediment to local spending.  The European Treaties prohibit 
[normal]discrimination against service providers 
[normal]on the grounds of nationality[bold].  Discrimination for this purpose means discriminating against service providers from 
[normal]other EU member states[bold], and from non-member states which have signed the Government Procurement Agreements.  The UK courts (not just the European courts) have therefore found 
[normal]‘buy British’ policies to be unlawful.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14[bold]              [bold]Some scope has been found for the exercise of discretion.  It is not for example lawful to specify that food is 
[normal]locally produced[bold], 
[normal]but it 
[normal]is
[normal] standard practice to specify that it is 
[normal]fresh[bold] or 
[normal]seasonal[bold]; and to take into account the level of harmful emissions caused by its transportation.        
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15[bold]              [bold]To this extent local government procurement has a lawful purpose unconnected with stimulating the local economy.  
[normal]Indiscriminate
[normal] 
[normal]local
[normal] procurement to stimulat
[normal]e
[normal] the local economy would however be unlawful.  It would also be ineffective, because 
[normal]all 
[normal]authorities would start doing it, so that what any local economy gained from its own local procurement it would lose from the loss of cross-border procurement
[normal] by other authorities
[normal].      
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Involving local residents in delivering value for money  [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]16[bold]              [bold]Local authorities have probably always had more feedback from residents about the 
[normal]effectiveness[bold] of local services than any other sort of public body.  Most authorities now actively solicit such feedback, so that its value is no doubt still rising. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17[bold]              [bold]Economy[bold] and 
[normal]efficiency[bold] are no less elements of value for money, but local residents are less directly interested in them than in their 
[normal]effectiveness[bold], which they are particularly well placed to judge.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Developing long-term relationships with contractors [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]18[bold]              [bold]Long-term relationships with contractors tend to be helped by
[normal]•[bold]              [bold]long term contracts
[normal]•[bold]              [bold]medium term contracts which may be renewed by mutual agreement
[normal]•[bold]              [bold]pain-and-gain sharing
[normal]•[bold]              [bold]joint development of methods and specifications
[normal]and are hindered by
[normal]•[bold]              [bold]external pressure (notably, to contract out)
[normal]•[bold]              [bold]large fields of 
[normal]tenderers
[normal]•[bold]              [bold]the bloody-minded pursuit by clients’ agents of performance minutiae  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]19[bold]              [bold]We see a steady general trend towards features of contracts which help rather than hinder good long-term relationships. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q2  Do authorities take sufficient advantage of collaborative and joint procurement opportunities, including those available from central government ?  [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]20[bold]              [bold]We believe that most local authorities take great advantage of these opportunities.  This is because local government has always made more use of collaborative and joint procurement than any other sector, and still does.  
[normal]Local authorities have set up a number of joint procurement organisations of which the Eastern Shire Purchasing Organisation, Kent Supplies, and the Yorkshire Purchasing Organisations are probably the best known examples; they share expertise, standardise procurement procedures and contract documentation and lower costs for all participants.  Local authorities may therefore reasonably claim
[normal] to have 
[normal]invented
[normal] joint procurement.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]21[bold]              [bold]The NHS is the only other sector which makes as much use of joint procurement.  But this must be partly accounted for by government 
[normal]assistance
[normal] for inter-trust trading, for example by the statutory creation of ‘NHS contracts’ which do not have to be advertised in OJEU.  On the other hand trading between local authorities has for many years been 
[normal]hindered
[normal], especially in England, by the requirement to trade through local authority companies, and by the absence of power to set up corporate joint committees.
[normal] 
[normal] Neither of these hindrances has been eased by the general power of competence. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Q3[bold]  [bold]How can local authorities access the skills, expertise and capabilities to implement effective procurement strategies, including value for money and social and economic objectives[bold] [bold]?  More specifically, does local government have sufficient understanding of its procurement expenditure and the markets for goods and services to deliver quality procurement strategies - locally and regionally.  If not, how can deficiencies be addressed ?  [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Access to the skills, expertise and capabilities needed for effective procurement strategies[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]22[bold]              
[normal]Local authorities, like most long-standing bodies, have the skills, expertise and capabilities to procure all their requirements using the types of contract and competition which are familiar in their own fields.  They have in addition always contributed well to the development of new types of contract and payment mechanism.  None of this means however that many practitioners will have, ready for use, the skills and expertise needed for new types of contract or payment mechanism which they have never seen in action before.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]23[bold]              
[normal]A striking example is provided by payment-by-results contracts for services in which meaningful results are not there to be measured until some years after the work has to be put in.  And if indeed no practitioners have the expertise necessary to make a good job of it, it is safe to assume that few home-based consultants will have it either.  However good new methods might be, their introduction usually has to be progressive.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Social and economic wellbeing[bold]&#xa0;[bold]24[bold]              
[normal]The achievement of social and economic wellbeing 
[normal]as a secondary objective
[normal] cannot in current conditions be a high priority for most public bodies.  This is for the reasons which we give at 
[normal]para
[normal] 
[normal]11[bold] above.            
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Understanding of procurement expenditure and the markets    [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]25[bold]              [bold]Most clients are usually well informed about the market for whatever types of contracts they currently use.  But we accept that this does not necessarily provide good information about 
[normal]•[bold]              [bold]whether a better market might be developed by 
[normal]modifying
[normal] these contracts
[normal]•[bold]              [bold]or, even more useful, if there are much better markets which might be reached by using 
[normal]entirely different
[normal] types of contracts.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]26[bold]              [bold]The
[normal] [bold]spread of information about alternative markets is at present hindered by the conflicting pressures on most public bodies to
[normal]•[bold]              [bold]achieve greater economies of scale by 
[normal]greater aggregation and joint procurement[bold]and at the same time to
[normal]•[bold]              [bold]help small businesses and third sector bodies by 
[normal]breaking up large packages[bold] 
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]27[bold]              [bold]The 
[normal]lotting[bold] of large contracts is sometimes put forward as a way of reconciling these conflicting injunctions, but 
[normal]lotting
[normal] is in practice ineffective if contractors are allowed to tender for all or most lots.  An all-lots tender then usually wins, because economies of scale then work hard in its favour.  
[normal]Authorities can in practice stop all-lots tenders winning only by giving notice that no tender for more than some small number of lots will be considered; in other words, by tilting the playing field firmly towards 
[normal]small businesses and third sector bodies
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Q4[bold]  [bold]To what extent is risk in local government procurement and contracting understood and managed and contracting strategies adopted, which are tailored to product and supplier market places ?  More specifically, do local authorities maintain and operate effective client management functions and have they entered contractual arrangements which allow the flexibility to meet changing circumstances such as budget reductions or changes in the way a service has to be delivered ?  [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Understanding of risk in local government procurement and contracting  [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]28[bold]              [bold]We believe that risk is better understood by practitioners in local government procurement than by many of their critics.  Authorities are for example often urged to apportion risk to the party 
[normal]best able
[normal] to minimise it, even though this party has 
[normal]no incentive
[normal] to minimise it.  Often the safest course for clients with big contracts to award is to 
[normal]minimise
[normal] risk transfer to contractors; this in turn minimises the danger that authorities will pay for risks twice - once when contractors build the cost of risks into their tenders, and again when failing contracts have to be rescued.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]29[bold]              [bold]We believe that our thinking about risk is widely shared, but we appreciate that it is controversial.  This is because it is diametrically opposed to PFI thinking.    
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Tailoring contracting strategies to product and supplier market places  [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]30[bold]              [bold]We repeat our view, stated in 
[normal]para
[normal] 
[normal]22[bold], that contracting strategies 
[normal]are
[normal] usually tailored to market places, but only to the market places which are reached by those same strategies.  Before any clients will agree willingly to explore different strategies they first require, very reasonably, to be convinced that the new markets will provide better services.  
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]31[bold]              
[normal]It is common for critics to find clients slow to adopt new procurement strategies.  This is however to be expected, because it is the clients, not the critics, who have to pick up the pieces if the new strategies prove unsuccessful.       
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Maintenance and operation of effective client management functions [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]32[bold]              [bold]We think authorities often seriously under-estimate the staffing needed for client management when they contract services out.  Authorities need to question advice that outsourcing satisfactorily transfers all the costs of a service to the contractor.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]33[bold]              [bold]The facts are different.  Q
[normal]uality control
[normal] needs staff, and the keener the tender the more staff it needs.  In addition, clients’ senior staff have to have the standing to be able to confront the managers of large national contractors.  
[normal]Client management units need enough experience and work knowledge to retender the contract on completion, and have to be capable of running the service if it has to be brought back in house at short notice.  Contractors’
[normal] staff are of course entitled to TUPE transfers but it is safe to assume that contractors’ best staff have by then already been snapped up, or have made better arrangements for themselves.       
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Contractual arrangements for meeting budget reductions and service delivery changes  [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]34[bold]              [bold]A great deal of thought has been given (by us and others) to devising contract terms and payment mechanisms which make it easier for clients to vary quantities and methods.  But it has to be accepted that the cost of any such variations is largely unaffected by terms and payment mechanisms; cost is instead dictated by the state of the market at the time of variation.  Contracts normally give contractors vested interests, and they are entitled to compensation for any damage to their interests.     
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]35[bold]              [bold]Contracts can of course be expressed to relieve clients from any such claims, but clients must expect the initial tenders for such contracts to be loaded correspondingly.     
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Q5[bold]  [bold]How is regularity and propriety of procurement secured and are the arrangements for detecting and addressing impropriety and fraud effective ?  [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]36[bold]              [bold]We believe that regularity and propriety are in general well protected in procurement.  This is not entirely surprising, given that protection against irregularity and impropriety was the top consideration in designing arrangements for procurement in the public sector (as we argue in 
[normal]para
[normal] 
[normal]07[bold]).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]37[bold]              [bold]The hardest irregularity to detect is probably collusive tendering.  Successive court actions brought by the Office of Fair Trading (and duly registered in the Register of Restrictive Trading Agreements) have shown how widespread collusion can become in particular trades or industries, even involving leading household names.  The nearest thing to a defence against collusion is for client authorities to maintain the closest possible security as to the names of firms from whom tenders are currently awaited.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q6  Is local authority procurement fully transparent, audited effectively and does it provide appropriate mechanisms for redress ?  Specifically, are the arrangements for securing the accountability of procured services and goods to local authorities and local residents adequate and effective ?  More specifically, to what extent are local authorities able to provide assurance to central government that value for money (in the broadest sense of the term) is delivered ?  [bold]&#xa0;[bold]Transparency and accountability[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]38[bold]              [bold]In general local government provides high levels of transparency and accountability, and probably higher than in any other sector.  Sometimes the danger is 
[normal]excessive
[normal] transparency, as just mentioned.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Audit[bold]&#xa0;[bold]39[bold]              [bold]The Audit Commission and its auditors provided a high level of audit of the value for money and probity of local authority procurement in England.  There will be close interest in whether the new audit regime will do the same.  
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Redress[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]40[bold]              [bold]A high degree of redress for 
[normal]disappointed 
[normal]tenderers
[normal] and applicants
[normal] has recently been provided for by the EU directives.  It is sometimes criticised for its high cost and labour intensiveness, but this could be remedied only by making redress free, which we do not think could be supported. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Assurance to central government     [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]41[bold]              [bold]We quite see that central government needs the best possible information about the level of value for money provided by local authorities’ procurement; and that anecdotal evidence, one way or the other, is a profoundly unsatisfactory basis for the necessary judgements.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]42[bold]              [bold]Far more
[normal] [bold]telling evidence is provided by the incidence of major catastrophes; for present purposes these include wildly unrealistic IT contracts, badly specified construction contracts, and other high prestige projects which were pushed by excessive high level client pressure followed by heroic tenders.  By this standard local government appears to have compared well with most other sectors for many years.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]43[bold]              [bold]We would be happy to cooperate in developing further mechanisms to test overall value for money, but at present we see no sign of any early breakthrough.     
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Overall [bold]value for money[bold]&#xa0;[bold]44[bold]              
[normal]A wider question is often asked.  It is whether local authorities could save a lot more by contracting out a lot more services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]45[bold]              
[normal]It is a serious question and deserves a serious answer.  At present this has to be that nobody knows.  What 
[normal]is
[normal] known is that substantial savings can be made by contracting out a service 
[normal]on a much reduced specification[bold], leaving the contractor to deal with all the ensuing redundancies in whatever is the cheapest way.  Authorities could do the same 
[normal]without
[normal] contracting out, but they would then have to deal with the redundancies themselves, which in the past many authorities were reluctant to do.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]46[bold]              
[normal]It is not so certain that substantial savings can be made by contracting out on an 
[normal]unchanged
[normal] specification.  We would however be happy to cooperate in any responsible exercise to test this too.  
[normal]But it would not be a quick or easy job.  Cost levels 5 or 10 years 
[normal]after
[normal] contracting out would need to be examined, to see how long any initial savings continue after contractors have acquired a vested interest in the volume and type of work.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]47[bold]              
[normal]It 
[normal]is 
[normal]probably more certain that savings can be made 
[normal]when in house teams win the work [bold]following competition for the first time for some years.  But this exercise too would need care if it is to carry conviction with all interested parties.
