default01default              defaultThe 
defaultCommissioning Joint Committeedefault comprises members of organisations representing all the disciplines involved in the commissioning of local authority work and services.  We publish guides to many aspects of commissioning, particularly those posing problems needing input from a range of disciplines. 
default&#xa0;
default02default              defaultThe CJC is sponsored by CIPFA but is an independent body, does not accept funding from any source, and meets all its expenses from the sale of CJC guides.  Our website is at

default&#xa0;defaultWhy we are responding to the Select Committeedefault&#xa0;
default03default              
defaultWe are responding because the Select Committee has asked penetrating questions which we often ask
default 
defaulttoo.  All the questions deserve serious consideration and we offer our own answers.  We would have no objection to our response being copied to whatever other parties the Select Committee thinks fit.
default&#xa0;
defaultFormatdefault&#xa0;
default04default              
defaultThe Committee asks six questions.  We reproduce all six, in italics, followed in each case by our own reply.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultQ1  To what extent is local government procurement organised to deliver value for money and social, economic and environmental objectives, including stimulating the local economy ?  To what extent are local authorities achieving the involvement of local residents in delivering value for money ?  To what extent are local authorities able to develop long-term relationships with contractors ?  default&#xa0;
defaultDelivering value for money default&#xa0;
default05default              defaultIt has to be accepted that VFM is not the only, or even the main, objective of public sector procurement.  In 2011 we conducted, jointly with the Association of Public Sector Excellence, an opinion survey of practitioners in local government, and received 1700 responses.  One question was whether practitioners think public sector procurement methods are intended to deliver three 
defaultobjectives, which we list below.  Replies indicated that (by short heads) more practitioners see the
default need to demonstrate probity and non-discrimination than value for money as drivers of procurement methods.  Those agreeing were
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default% defaultprobity
default91.9
defaultno discrimination against EU 
defaulttenderers
default90.2
defaultvalue for money
default86.9
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default06default              defaultWe do not want to make too much of the 
defaultsequence
default of these three drivers; so let’s call them first equal.  But it is still clear that local authorities have to look for ways of delivering value for money that do not stop them demonstrating probity and non-discrimination.
default&#xa0;
default07default              defaultThe need to demonstrate probity has been a powerful factor in local government, at least since the introduction of district auditors in 1841.  Its power derives from the need for anybody spending other people’s money to keep good records showing what they spent it on, and why.  
default&#xa0;
default08default              defaultCCT, the EU procurement rules, the best value regime and Freedom of Information have all required more and more disclosure.  But, as often happens to disclosure rights, the various people exercising them often assert that the bodies questioned have to make decisions in such a way that they can be explained, even if this restricts the choices available.  This assertion is of course incorrect; the law does not require parties answering questions to convince others that their decisions were right; the onus is on others to show that these decisions were wrong.  This assertion by questioners is however ineradicable, and all too many practitioners give in to it.  
default&#xa0;
default09default              defaultPrivate citizens spending their own money, and to a great extent private sector bodies, do not have to explain their actions in this way.  They are free within the law to make up their own minds about what is best for themselves.  Public sector practitioners on the other hand have to keep ‘ease of explanation’ in mind in all their decision-making, and devote prime thinking-time to it.             
default&#xa0;
defaultDelivering social, economic and environmental objectives default&#xa0;
default10default              defaultVirtually all local government procurement has always been for the purpose of one or other social, economic or environmental objectives under statutory duties.  Since 2000 local authorities have also had power to pursue these objectives in such a way as to secure 
defaultany other
default social, economic or environmental objectives at the same time, either as add-ons or as side effects.
default&#xa0;
default11default              defaultMeanwhile budgets for performing statutory duties have been steadily reduced.  It would therefore demand explanation if authorities were now to choose to spend a significant proportion of their diminishing budgets on add-on objectives for which they have powers, but not duties or budgets; or to reorganise their procurement for this specific purpose.    
default&#xa0;
defaultDelivering stimulation of the local economy default&#xa0;
default12default              defaultEconomic regeneration
default is one of the few powers for which authorities have for years had budgets, and which they continue to pursue.  Organising procurement to 
defaultstimulate the local economy
default does however mean something different; it means spending money whenever possible 
defaultlocally rather than elsewhere
default.
default&#xa0;
default13default              defaultThere is however an impediment to local spending.  The European Treaties prohibit 
defaultdiscrimination against service providers 
defaulton the grounds of nationalitydefault.  Discrimination for this purpose means discriminating against service providers from 
defaultother EU member statesdefault, and from non-member states which have signed the Government Procurement Agreements.  The UK courts (not just the European courts) have therefore found 
default‘buy British’ policies to be unlawful.
default&#xa0;
default14default              defaultSome scope has been found for the exercise of discretion.  It is not for example lawful to specify that food is 
defaultlocally produceddefault, 
defaultbut it 
defaultis
default standard practice to specify that it is 
defaultfreshdefault or 
defaultseasonaldefault; and to take into account the level of harmful emissions caused by its transportation.        
default&#xa0;
default15default              defaultTo this extent local government procurement has a lawful purpose unconnected with stimulating the local economy.  
defaultIndiscriminate
default 
defaultlocal
default procurement to stimulat
defaulte
default the local economy would however be unlawful.  It would also be ineffective, because 
defaultall 
defaultauthorities would start doing it, so that what any local economy gained from its own local procurement it would lose from the loss of cross-border procurement
default by other authorities
default.      
default&#xa0;
defaultInvolving local residents in delivering value for money  default&#xa0;
default16default              defaultLocal authorities have probably always had more feedback from residents about the 
defaulteffectivenessdefault of local services than any other sort of public body.  Most authorities now actively solicit such feedback, so that its value is no doubt still rising. 
default&#xa0;
default17default              defaultEconomydefault and 
defaultefficiencydefault are no less elements of value for money, but local residents are less directly interested in them than in their 
defaulteffectivenessdefault, which they are particularly well placed to judge.  
default&#xa0;
defaultDeveloping long-term relationships with contractors default&#xa0;
default18default              defaultLong-term relationships with contractors tend to be helped by
default•default              defaultlong term contracts
default•default              defaultmedium term contracts which may be renewed by mutual agreement
default•default              defaultpain-and-gain sharing
default•default              defaultjoint development of methods and specifications
defaultand are hindered by
default•default              defaultexternal pressure (notably, to contract out)
default•default              defaultlarge fields of 
defaulttenderers
default•default              defaultthe bloody-minded pursuit by clients’ agents of performance minutiae  
default&#xa0;
default19default              defaultWe see a steady general trend towards features of contracts which help rather than hinder good long-term relationships. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ2  Do authorities take sufficient advantage of collaborative and joint procurement opportunities, including those available from central government ?  default&#xa0;
default20default              defaultWe believe that most local authorities take great advantage of these opportunities.  This is because local government has always made more use of collaborative and joint procurement than any other sector, and still does.  
defaultLocal authorities have set up a number of joint procurement organisations of which the Eastern Shire Purchasing Organisation, Kent Supplies, and the Yorkshire Purchasing Organisations are probably the best known examples; they share expertise, standardise procurement procedures and contract documentation and lower costs for all participants.  Local authorities may therefore reasonably claim
default to have 
defaultinvented
default joint procurement.
default&#xa0;default21default              defaultThe NHS is the only other sector which makes as much use of joint procurement.  But this must be partly accounted for by government 
defaultassistance
default for inter-trust trading, for example by the statutory creation of ‘NHS contracts’ which do not have to be advertised in OJEU.  On the other hand trading between local authorities has for many years been 
defaulthindered
default, especially in England, by the requirement to trade through local authority companies, and by the absence of power to set up corporate joint committees.
default 
default Neither of these hindrances has been eased by the general power of competence. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultQ3default  defaultHow can local authorities access the skills, expertise and capabilities to implement effective procurement strategies, including value for money and social and economic objectivesdefault default?  More specifically, does local government have sufficient understanding of its procurement expenditure and the markets for goods and services to deliver quality procurement strategies - locally and regionally.  If not, how can deficiencies be addressed ?  default&#xa0;
defaultAccess to the skills, expertise and capabilities needed for effective procurement strategiesdefault&#xa0;
default22default              
defaultLocal authorities, like most long-standing bodies, have the skills, expertise and capabilities to procure all their requirements using the types of contract and competition which are familiar in their own fields.  They have in addition always contributed well to the development of new types of contract and payment mechanism.  None of this means however that many practitioners will have, ready for use, the skills and expertise needed for new types of contract or payment mechanism which they have never seen in action before.
default&#xa0;
default23default              
defaultA striking example is provided by payment-by-results contracts for services in which meaningful results are not there to be measured until some years after the work has to be put in.  And if indeed no practitioners have the expertise necessary to make a good job of it, it is safe to assume that few home-based consultants will have it either.  However good new methods might be, their introduction usually has to be progressive.
default&#xa0;
defaultSocial and economic wellbeingdefault&#xa0;default24default              
defaultThe achievement of social and economic wellbeing 
defaultas a secondary objective
default cannot in current conditions be a high priority for most public bodies.  This is for the reasons which we give at 
defaultpara
default 
default11default above.            
default&#xa0;
defaultUnderstanding of procurement expenditure and the markets    default&#xa0;
default25default              defaultMost clients are usually well informed about the market for whatever types of contracts they currently use.  But we accept that this does not necessarily provide good information about 
default•default              defaultwhether a better market might be developed by 
defaultmodifying
default these contracts
default•default              defaultor, even more useful, if there are much better markets which might be reached by using 
defaultentirely different
default types of contracts.
default&#xa0;
default26default              defaultThe
default defaultspread of information about alternative markets is at present hindered by the conflicting pressures on most public bodies to
default•default              defaultachieve greater economies of scale by 
defaultgreater aggregation and joint procurementdefaultand at the same time to
default•default              defaulthelp small businesses and third sector bodies by 
defaultbreaking up large packagesdefault 
default  
default&#xa0;
default27default              defaultThe 
defaultlottingdefault of large contracts is sometimes put forward as a way of reconciling these conflicting injunctions, but 
defaultlotting
default is in practice ineffective if contractors are allowed to tender for all or most lots.  An all-lots tender then usually wins, because economies of scale then work hard in its favour.  
defaultAuthorities can in practice stop all-lots tenders winning only by giving notice that no tender for more than some small number of lots will be considered; in other words, by tilting the playing field firmly towards 
defaultsmall businesses and third sector bodies
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultQ4default  defaultTo what extent is risk in local government procurement and contracting understood and managed and contracting strategies adopted, which are tailored to product and supplier market places ?  More specifically, do local authorities maintain and operate effective client management functions and have they entered contractual arrangements which allow the flexibility to meet changing circumstances such as budget reductions or changes in the way a service has to be delivered ?  default&#xa0;
defaultUnderstanding of risk in local government procurement and contracting  default&#xa0;
default28default              defaultWe believe that risk is better understood by practitioners in local government procurement than by many of their critics.  Authorities are for example often urged to apportion risk to the party 
defaultbest able
default to minimise it, even though this party has 
defaultno incentive
default to minimise it.  Often the safest course for clients with big contracts to award is to 
defaultminimise
default risk transfer to contractors; this in turn minimises the danger that authorities will pay for risks twice - once when contractors build the cost of risks into their tenders, and again when failing contracts have to be rescued.
default&#xa0;
default29default              defaultWe believe that our thinking about risk is widely shared, but we appreciate that it is controversial.  This is because it is diametrically opposed to PFI thinking.    
default&#xa0;
defaultTailoring contracting strategies to product and supplier market places  default&#xa0;
default30default              defaultWe repeat our view, stated in 
defaultpara
default 
default22default, that contracting strategies 
defaultare
default usually tailored to market places, but only to the market places which are reached by those same strategies.  Before any clients will agree willingly to explore different strategies they first require, very reasonably, to be convinced that the new markets will provide better services.  
default 
default 
default&#xa0;
default31default              
defaultIt is common for critics to find clients slow to adopt new procurement strategies.  This is however to be expected, because it is the clients, not the critics, who have to pick up the pieces if the new strategies prove unsuccessful.       
default&#xa0;
defaultMaintenance and operation of effective client management functions default&#xa0;
default32default              defaultWe think authorities often seriously under-estimate the staffing needed for client management when they contract services out.  Authorities need to question advice that outsourcing satisfactorily transfers all the costs of a service to the contractor.  
default&#xa0;
default33default              defaultThe facts are different.  Q
defaultuality control
default needs staff, and the keener the tender the more staff it needs.  In addition, clients’ senior staff have to have the standing to be able to confront the managers of large national contractors.  
defaultClient management units need enough experience and work knowledge to retender the contract on completion, and have to be capable of running the service if it has to be brought back in house at short notice.  Contractors’
default staff are of course entitled to TUPE transfers but it is safe to assume that contractors’ best staff have by then already been snapped up, or have made better arrangements for themselves.       
default&#xa0;
defaultContractual arrangements for meeting budget reductions and service delivery changes  default&#xa0;
default34default              defaultA great deal of thought has been given (by us and others) to devising contract terms and payment mechanisms which make it easier for clients to vary quantities and methods.  But it has to be accepted that the cost of any such variations is largely unaffected by terms and payment mechanisms; cost is instead dictated by the state of the market at the time of variation.  Contracts normally give contractors vested interests, and they are entitled to compensation for any damage to their interests.     
default&#xa0;
default35default              defaultContracts can of course be expressed to relieve clients from any such claims, but clients must expect the initial tenders for such contracts to be loaded correspondingly.     
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultQ5default  defaultHow is regularity and propriety of procurement secured and are the arrangements for detecting and addressing impropriety and fraud effective ?  default&#xa0;
default36default              defaultWe believe that regularity and propriety are in general well protected in procurement.  This is not entirely surprising, given that protection against irregularity and impropriety was the top consideration in designing arrangements for procurement in the public sector (as we argue in 
defaultpara
default 
default07default).
default&#xa0;
default37default              defaultThe hardest irregularity to detect is probably collusive tendering.  Successive court actions brought by the Office of Fair Trading (and duly registered in the Register of Restrictive Trading Agreements) have shown how widespread collusion can become in particular trades or industries, even involving leading household names.  The nearest thing to a defence against collusion is for client authorities to maintain the closest possible security as to the names of firms from whom tenders are currently awaited.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultQ6  Is local authority procurement fully transparent, audited effectively and does it provide appropriate mechanisms for redress ?  Specifically, are the arrangements for securing the accountability of procured services and goods to local authorities and local residents adequate and effective ?  More specifically, to what extent are local authorities able to provide assurance to central government that value for money (in the broadest sense of the term) is delivered ?  default&#xa0;defaultTransparency and accountabilitydefault&#xa0;
default38default              defaultIn general local government provides high levels of transparency and accountability, and probably higher than in any other sector.  Sometimes the danger is 
defaultexcessive
default transparency, as just mentioned.
default&#xa0;
defaultAuditdefault&#xa0;default39default              defaultThe Audit Commission and its auditors provided a high level of audit of the value for money and probity of local authority procurement in England.  There will be close interest in whether the new audit regime will do the same.  
default&#xa0;defaultRedressdefault&#xa0;
default40default              defaultA high degree of redress for 
defaultdisappointed 
defaulttenderers
default and applicants
default has recently been provided for by the EU directives.  It is sometimes criticised for its high cost and labour intensiveness, but this could be remedied only by making redress free, which we do not think could be supported. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAssurance to central government     default&#xa0;
default41default              defaultWe quite see that central government needs the best possible information about the level of value for money provided by local authorities’ procurement; and that anecdotal evidence, one way or the other, is a profoundly unsatisfactory basis for the necessary judgements.
default&#xa0;
default42default              defaultFar more
default defaulttelling evidence is provided by the incidence of major catastrophes; for present purposes these include wildly unrealistic IT contracts, badly specified construction contracts, and other high prestige projects which were pushed by excessive high level client pressure followed by heroic tenders.  By this standard local government appears to have compared well with most other sectors for many years.
default&#xa0;
default43default              defaultWe would be happy to cooperate in developing further mechanisms to test overall value for money, but at present we see no sign of any early breakthrough.     
default&#xa0;
defaultOverall defaultvalue for moneydefault&#xa0;default44default              
defaultA wider question is often asked.  It is whether local authorities could save a lot more by contracting out a lot more services.
default&#xa0;
default45default              
defaultIt is a serious question and deserves a serious answer.  At present this has to be that nobody knows.  What 
defaultis
default known is that substantial savings can be made by contracting out a service 
defaulton a much reduced specificationdefault, leaving the contractor to deal with all the ensuing redundancies in whatever is the cheapest way.  Authorities could do the same 
defaultwithout
default contracting out, but they would then have to deal with the redundancies themselves, which in the past many authorities were reluctant to do.
default&#xa0;
default46default              
defaultIt is not so certain that substantial savings can be made by contracting out on an 
defaultunchanged
default specification.  We would however be happy to cooperate in any responsible exercise to test this too.  
defaultBut it would not be a quick or easy job.  Cost levels 5 or 10 years 
defaultafter
default contracting out would need to be examined, to see how long any initial savings continue after contractors have acquired a vested interest in the volume and type of work.  
default&#xa0;
default47default              
defaultIt 
defaultis 
defaultprobably more certain that savings can be made 
defaultwhen in house teams win the work defaultfollowing competition for the first time for some years.  But this exercise too would need care if it is to carry conviction with all interested parties.
