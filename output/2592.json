"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Carers UK&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCarers UK is deeply concerned about the impact \non carers \nof \nchanges to housing costs as a result of the Welfare Reform Act\n. \nWe have \ngrowing evidence that these measures are pushing carers and disabled people into financial crisis\n and putting them at risk o\nf eviction and \nlong-term poverty\n and debt\n. \nWe fear the situation of carers and dis\nabled people is likely to further worsen\n as other changes\n,\n including reductions in spending on disability benefits\n,\n are overlaid onto the current changes. \n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur evidence also\n shows that the localised and discretionary mitigation measures that the Government argues should protect carers and disabled people who need support are failing \ndue to\n \ninsufficient guidance and f\nunding from central Government\n. We believe that the \nGovernment \nshould, across a number of the changes, exempt carers and disabled people, rather than relying on local discretion. \n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCarers UK \nhas been highly critical of\n the Government’s\n failure to adequate\nly\n assess \nin advance the impact of these policies, in\ndividually or cumulatively, on carers and disabled people\n, \nor to respond to emerging evidence from Carers UK and other stakeholders with urgent additional mitigation measures. Families cannot wait for the results of the Government’s medium \nterm evaluation\n \nof these policies, and Carers UK urges the Government to immediately begin a review of the impact of changes to support with housing costs \non families as part of a cumulative impact assessment of the impact of the Welfare Reform Act. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCarers UK welcomed\n the early, if\n very\n limited\n,\n exemptions for tenants or tenants’ partners who needed overnight care provided by a non-resident (for example a care worker), and \nthe Government’s later concession on rooms \nfor\n disabled children \nunable to share with siblings. However we identified a number of groups of disab\nled people and carers who \nwould be considered to have ‘spare’ accommodation and would face a shortfall in their rent, despite having a clear need for that\n accommodation. \nFor these families, the additional accommodation is essential, not spare – \nyet\n they are still affected by the policy.\n These include:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBecause of their need for the additional space, the set of options \nsuggested by the Government\n to families affected are not appropriate. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDespite the fact that t\nhese options are highly inappropriate for many carers and disabled people, they continue to be suggested \nas options to\n these families – this contributes to feeling that both the Government and local councils \nhave little understanding of \ntheir needs and cir\ncumstances. \n&#xa0;\n2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn addition, the policy fails to take regard \nof the \nimplications \nof \nmoving disabled people or carers, \nwho \nmay have infrequently used\n ‘spare’\n bedrooms\n,\n but where \na move away from local support networks could bring considerable\n social\n \nand \npublic spending\n costs\n. \n \nIf disabled people and carers r\nely on local friends, relatives\n, community and voluntary support to \nmeet or support\n care needs, then their ability to live independently or continu\ne to care could be significantly \naffected if they move\n away from thes\ne support networks.\n The loss of support and independence may result in considerable knock-on costs to \nhealth and social care services and undermines\n the community ‘asset-based approach’ which the Government is building into the Care Bill.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCarers UK was\n deeply disappointed that Government did not implement exemptions for \nthe circumstances outlined above and we do not accept \nthat discretionary housing payments (DHPs)\n \nare an appropriate \nmechanism to protect\n families in these circumstances. \n&#xa0;\n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDHPs \nare designed to \nprovide\n temporary support for transition or crisis periods. \nWhilst Government has suggested that \ncouncils\n are able to make indefinite awards\n,\n our evidence indicates that \nuncertainty about the stability of DHP funding from central government means that \ncouncils\n are \nmaking maximum awards of one year\n and\n often for much shorter periods. \n&#xa0;\n3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf families have a clear\n need for the additional accommodation they will still go through the process of that accommodation being classed as ‘spare’, seein\ng their Housing Benefit reduced\n and having to apply every year (if not more frequently) for discretionary payments to cover t\nhe shortfall. \nNot only is this illogical\n and\n \nbureaucratically wasteful, but it is causing \nhuge distress amongst \nfamilies \nwho are often already struggling with the mental and physical pressures of caring, ill-health and disability. \nG\novernment\n has\n shown little recognition of the impact this process would have even on families who are successfully awarded \nDHPs\n. \nThe f\namilies affected fear the loss of their homes, have to complete lengthy and detailed application forms for discretionary payments and o\nften wait for months for a decision which may only gi\nve them temporary security. The pressure this is putting on families affected is\n huge\n, particularly \nfor those who will need the additional space long-term, or indee\nd for the rest of their lives. T\nhe know\nledge that \nthey will have to conduct this process over and over again simply to remain in their homes is debilitating\n. \n&#xa0;\nFor example, a\n carer, who cares full-time\n for\n his wife who has a mental health condition\n,\n \nand who had been waiting three months for a \nD\nHPs\n decision\n,\n said:\n&#xa0;\n“She can’t \nleave the house normally\n, \nand now she\n \ndoesn’t even\n feel safe \nthere\n. \nSince this happened she has gone\n completely\n \ndownhill. \nShe is \npanics \nevery time\n she thinks about it\n,\n which is every day. I can’t ever show it to her, but \nI’\nm struggling to hold it together \nmysel\nf with this weighing down on us. We cannot cope with this \npressure for\n the rest of our lives.\n”\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGovernment has suggested \non different occasions \nthat the DHPs also enable councils to make an effective assessment of need\n on a case-by-case basis.\n \nIn a letter responding to \na Carers UK\n submission \nto\n Downing Street\n on this policy\n, the Government states tha\nt discretionary payments afford\n local authorities \n‘\nthe discretion to support those most in need’ and that blanket exemptio\nns would not have delivered ‘the range of flexibilities needed to cover every individual circumstance’\n. \nHowever Carers UK’s evidence indic\na\ntes that many DHP claims are being assessed in financial terms ra\nther than on an \nassessment of need related to disability. We have heard from families where the council \nrecognised their \ncare and support needs through the allocation of properties with additional rooms\n, but turned the same families down for DHPs to pay for those rooms on\n financial \nground. Examples included \nbeing turned down \nbecause their spending on food exceed\ned\n £3.50 per person per day, or\n because\n other items of household expenditure \nwere\n considered non-essential. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is also\n increasing evidence that the discretionary funds available are insufficient to \nmeet\n disabled people\n’s\n an\nd carers’\n needs. \nSince\n April 2013\n,\n \n£25 million in funding\n has been made available to local authorities to mitigate the imp\nact of the change to size criteria on disabled people.\n \nThe \nDHPs\n Guidance Manual states that ‘\nt\nhe \nextra funding is intended to provide additional help to disabled claimants living in properties where significant adaptations have been made\n’ and that ‘the \nallocation of the additional funding for disabled people broadly reflects the impact of this measure and the additional funding needed to support this group’\n.\n Carers UK has not been able to determine the basis on which the Department for Work and Pensions\n calculated the size of this fund or the rationale behind \nusing\n ‘\nsignificant adaptations’\n as a proxy for need related to poor health or disability. \n&#xa0;\n4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe believe this fails to recognise the reality of many health conditions, disabilities and caring scenario\ns. There\n are a wide variety of circumstances where an additional room is needed, unrelated to adaptations. \nFor example,\n \ncarers of \npartners with early-onset dementia or post-traumatic stress disorder who wake up not recognising thei\nr partners and who can la\nsh out.\n&#xa0;\n4.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe DHP\n Guide does state \nDHPs should be considered where\n \na\n long term medical condition \n‘\ncreates dif\nficulties in sharing a bedroom’. \nHowever \nit is clear from examining\n a selection of local authority procedures\n and from carers’ experiences that a number \nof councils\n \nare\n \nusing the guidance to specifically link\n eligibility for discretionary payments\n to adaptations\n. \nIn addition, if the value of the DHP funding has been calculated in relation to the number of people \nwith adaptations\n,\n then extension of the payments to individuals with different needs \nwill result in a shortfall.\n&#xa0;\n4.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe Government’s impact assessment\ns\n indicat\ned\n that 420,000 disabled people would be affected\n by the change in size criteria. However, on the b\nasis of an average shortfall of £14 a week, this \nfund would support fewer than 40,000 disabled people to stay in their homes \nfor a year (the duration of the £25 million fund)\n. T\nhis represents\n fewer than 1 in 10 of \nthe disabled people\n affected. \nEstimates fr\nom the National Housing Federation showed that approximately 100,000 disabled people affected \nhave home adaptations\n, so the discretionary pot would not cover even this smaller group.\n4.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\no examine carers’ experiences of accessing DHPs, in \nJuly 2013\n Carers UK interviewed \na \nsample\n \nof carers affected\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOf the \n101 \ncar\ners interviewed, \n8% were\n exempt \nas a result of overnight care and disabled children’s exemptions\n and\n \n56% had applied for discretionary payments from their local council to cover the shortf\nall.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCarers UK has been heavily promoting advice and information encouraging carers to apply for discretionary payments if they \nwere\n affected. \nHowever, only\n just over half of \nthose interviewed \nhad\n applied for \nDHPs\n. Many were aware of DHPs but had not applied for a variety of reasons – some had been informally told by \ncouncil\n officers ‘not to bother\n’\n applying because insufficient funds meant they were v\nery unlikely to get any support;\n others \nhad been told support wa\ns only temporary so\n had decided against\n completing\n application forms \nfor just a few weeks or months of support.\n&#xa0;\n4.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nO\nnly 23% of those interviewed had received a discretionary payment – of those, \njust under half\n were rec\neiving support for a full year\n, and \njust\n over half\n had received temporary support for between 3-8 months\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor those who had either not applied for DHPs, whose applications had been turned down\n or whose DHPs had expired,\n the impact of paying the shortfall in rent was extremely serious\n.\n \n75% were\n cutting back on essential spending like food and heating.\n \nFor example:\n&#xa0;\nZara cares full time for her husband who has Huntington’s Disease\n and has herself herself suffered two strokes.\n Her husband’s illness means his\n sleep is constantly disturbed and they \nwere allocated a home with a \nsecond bedroom \nto allow\n Zara the spac\ne to get the respite she needs. It is now\n considered ‘spare’ \nand they face\n £15 a week shortfall in their rent on top of £2 a week \nfrom the\n replacement of \nCouncil Tax benefit – \nin total\n £884 \nmore a year. \n&#xa0;\nThe couple applied for \nDHPs\n, and were initially declined because\n \ntheir local authority stated expenditure on items like postage stamps, spectacles and savings to buy a vacuum cleaner\n were non-essential\n. Following an appeal\n,\n they were awarded 12 weeks of DHPs which has now run out. They have made a second application (unable to apply unti\nl\n the previous DHPs expired) and \nawait\n a decision. \n&#xa0;\nThey cannot now afford their bills. \nZara \nis restricting herself to one meal a day and \ncannot reduce the bills by cutting down on food for her ill husband – his condition means he loses weight rapidly and to maintain his health he must have a high calorie diet. \n(Anonymised). \n&#xa0;\n4.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOf \ncarers paying the shortfall\n,\n 1\n7% \nwere \nin arrears and 8% were p\naying by getting into debt\n. These\n include \na couple caring for a disabled daughter who use their box room so that one of them can get a full night’s sleep whilst the other can get up when needed to provide night\n-t\nime care. They cannot afford to pay the shor\ntfall in their rent created by this room being considered spare and have been in arrears since April as a result. They \nare at risk of eviction.\n&#xa0;\n4.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThese examples illustrate that the Government’s mitigation measures are woefully inadequate and that carers and their families are facing devastating consequences. The failure of the Government to respond to warnings in advance of this policy or to mounting evidence which has borne out these warnings is reprehensible – it is exposing vulnerable people to financial crisis and long-term poverty. Even those who qualify for discretionary support face insecurity and the risk of losing their homes for the duration of their disability or caring responsibilities – often for life. Carers UK continues to call for the Government to urgently exempt carers and disabled people from the size criteria changes. &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCarers UK believes that the exclusion of carers from the protected groups within Council Tax \nlocali\ns\na\ntion\n and inclusion\n of\n carers within the household benefit cap are inconsistent with the rationale for both policies. The Government has \nstated that both changes are designed to apply to ‘workless households’, improve work incentives, promote behaviour chan\nge and discourage long-term benefit claims\n. None of these aims should apply to carer households, \nand the fact that they do contradicts the Government’s assertion that\n ‘the \none thing \n[they]\n are not looking to encourage is a change in the carer's behaviour so that they stop caring\n’. \n&#xa0;\n5.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLocalisation of Council Tax support: \nCarers UK argued that carers should be a protected group alongside pensioners\n,\n as Council Tax Benefit was replaced by loca\nl reductions schemes\n. \nHowever\n Government did not accept this recommendation and\n,\n furthermore, the guidance issued to local authorities made no mention of caring responsibilities in relation to vulnerable groups who should be prioritized for support through\n local \nschemes.\n \nT\nhis omission is a further example of a failure to \nrecognize \nthe pressures and limitations that caring places on families’ ability to work, and continues the insulting and misguided suggestion that carers are ‘workless’. It exposes carers t\no considerable extra costs when they have limited or no capacity to increase their incomes through work. \n&#xa0;\n5.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCarers UK has not yet completed detailed analysis of the impact of localizing Council Tax support on carers, which will form part of our Caring &amp;\n Family Finances Inquiry, to be published in December. \nHowever we are concerned by growing evidence from research and our Adviceline that many \ncouncils\n \nare not protecting carers.\n \n&#xa0;\n5.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs a snapshot example,\n \nin \nHertfordshire\n,\n \nof the\n 10 district councils in the\n county\n, s\nome are protecting disabled people, some are protecting those on benefits with children under 5 and some are protecting several vulnerable groups.  However currently only one district council in the county is proposing to protect carers.\n&#xa0;\n5.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur e\nvi\ndence gathered in relation to the changes to the social sector size criteria highlights not only that the localisation of council support is resulting in carers losing support and having to pay more, but that different cuts to financial support are combini\nng to put even greater pressure on carers and their families. Of the carers affected by the changes to the size criteria who we interviewed, \n29% were also facing additional Council Tax payments as a result of the abolition of Council Tax Benefit. \nFamilies \nwho \nface a rent shortfall of as much as £1200 a year\n, as a result of the size criteria changes, are also having to pay\n a further £300 \na year \nin Council Tax charges. This would be a difficult financial burden for most families to manage, but those already \nseeing reduced incomes and additional costs as a result of disability and caring\n are less likely to be able to cope.\n5.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHousehold benefit cap: During the passage of the Welfare Reform Act Carers UK urged the Government to exempt households including individua\nls with entitlement to Carer’s Allowance from the household benefit cap. Whilst \nexemptions were put in place \nfor \nDisability Living Allowance claimants, war widows, and famil\nies claiming Working Tax Credit this fails to protect significant groups of carers.\n&#xa0;5.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n As a result of the definition of a ‘household’\n, \ncarers caring for \ndisabled children under 18 and disabled partners would be exempt (as the eligibility for disability benefits would\n fall within their benefit unit). H\nowever carers caring for \nadult disable\nd children or other adult relatives\n would be affected by the cap as, even if the person they cared \nfor lived in the same property, \nthe exemption from the benefit cap would only include the benefit unit of the disabled adult and would not protect other adul\nts within the household. \n&#xa0;\n5.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis \nis inconsistent\n and illogical – as a full time carer of a disabled child aged 17 years old would be protected from the cap, but the same carer would be affected as soon as their child turned 18. A full time carer of a disabl\ned partner would be protected but a full-time carer of a disabled sibling would be subject to the cap. \n&#xa0;\n5.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe\n Government\n’s impact assessments have predicted\n that of the 56,000 households capped in 2013/14, \n5,000 households are expected to include a Carer’s Allowance claimant, and they will see \nan average\n reduction in income of £105 a week.\n This will be devastating for many of the families affected who are often already struggling to make ends meet. \nAgain, \nCa\nrers UK \nwill be gathering examples of the impact of the cap but we have not yet gathered sufficient data to include within this submission. \n&#xa0;5.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCarers UK believes it is deeply unfair for carers to both be subject to the household benefit cap and subject to new Council Tax charges. Doing so sends out a very negative message about the value the Government places on caring and may lead to family finances collapsing and caring becoming financially untenable. We continue to call on the Government to exempt Carer’s Allowance from the cap and to reconsider adding carers as a protected group within Council Tax reductions schemes. At the least, new guidance should be issued to councils on making carers a priority group for support within local reductions schemes.&#xa0;&#xa0;30 September  2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n Response letter from Dan York-Smith, Private Secretary, 10 Downing Street - 3\nrd\n September 2013\n Housing Benefit: Under occupation of social housing – Impact Assessment  (June 2012) Department for Work and Pensions\n Discretionary Housing Payments Guidance Manual (April 2013) Department for Work and Pensions\n Localising Support for Council Tax Vulnerable people – key local authority duties (May 2012) Department for Communities and Local Government\n Lords \n23 Jan 2012\n: Col. 893\n"
