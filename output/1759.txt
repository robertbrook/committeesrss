[[[&#xa0;]]]a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Santander welcomes the opportunity to respond to this call for evidence &#xa0;b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Santander

[[[ ]]]UK is a full-service retail and commercial bank providing services to some 15 million active customers, with almost 1,200 branches and 37 regional Corporate Business Centres. &#xa0;c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Santander UK is a wholly owned subsidiary of Banco Santander SA.&#xa0;Santander manages its affairs autonomously with its own local management team responsible for its performance.&#xa0;Santander UK is firmly focused on the UK with c. 98% of customer assets UK-related and c. 80% of customer loans consisting of prime residential mortgages to UK customers. Santander UK is subject to the full supervision of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) in the UK. Santander customers are protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) in the UK.&#xa0;d)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is Santander’s ambition to be the bank of choice for UK companies. In 2012, Santander increased its net lending to SMEs in Northern Ireland by 27% (compared to Santander’s national average of 18%). Santander is a challenger to the Big Four banks in SME lending across the country, where we have 5.5% market share. &#xa0;e)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Santander has approximately 700,000 retail customers in Northern Ireland. This includes a network of 31 retail branches. In Northern Ireland, Santander has opened almost 28,000 1|2|3 credit card accounts since its launch in September 2011 and over 27,000 1|2|3 current accounts since its launch in March 2012. &#xa0;f)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Santander is committed to Northern Ireland where we are proud to be a key private sector employer. We employ over 1,100 staff in the country, including 800 employees based at our key site at Mays Meadow in Belfast.&#xa0;g)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We note that some of the questions in this call for evidence are very specific in nature or related to individual financial services companies. Consequently, we have only responded to those questions where Santander can offer a particular insight to the Committee.

[[[ ]]]&#xa0;1.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Santander does not differentiate its business in Northern Ireland compared to Great Britain.&#xa0;1.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We offer the same range of products to our customers and make lending decisions for both our individual customers and business customers in the same way. &#xa0;1.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As a consequence of this, we do not believe that our customers are in any way disadvantaged by banking with Santander in Northern Ireland as opposed to those banking with us in Great Britain. &#xa0;

[[[ince 2008 exacerbated that position? ]]]&#xa0;2.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is Santander’s ambition to be the bank of choice for companies across the country, including in Northern Ireland.&#xa0;2.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; While some of the banks operating in Northern Ireland have seen a declining appetite for lending since 2008, Santander is committed to growing this part of its business in the years ahead. Our experience over the last 18 months suggests that there is no shortage of SMEs seeking funding in Northern Ireland. &#xa0;2.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In 2012, Santander grew its net lending to SMEs in Northern Ireland by 27%. This compares to a national lending increase by Santander UK of 18%. Our commitment to grow our lending to SMEs in Northern Ireland has continued into 2013. As of 30 June 2013, Santander grew its net lending to SMEs in Northern Ireland by 32% from a year earlier. &#xa0;2.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Funding for expansion for companies in Northern Ireland, as in Great Britain, is often provided by banks in the form of invoice finance or factoring. These provide a high level of control and transparency, especially for younger businesses. These products are likely to remain popular for banks and businesses in the years ahead.  &#xa0;2.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Providing banking products for start up businesses is a challenge that banks face in both Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Banks find it difficult to provide lending to new businesses due to a lack of track record and, usually, a lack of trading data on which to base risk assessments. &#xa0;2.6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The UK Government has sought to overcome this problem through the Start-Up Loans programme. Santander supports this initiative and considers it an excellent example of how government can help more start up businesses grow and create jobs. &#xa0;2.7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Start-Up Loans are available to business in Northern Ireland. &#xa0;

[[[Is the population of NI at a disadvantage to the rest of the ]]]

[[[UK]]]

[[[ as a result of the lack of uptake of national economic recovery initiatives by banks in NI?]]]&#xa0;3.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Santander UK participates in a number of government schemes available in Northern Ireland designed to help boost the economic recovery. These include: &#xa0;3.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Our customers in Northern Ireland benefit from these schemes in the same way as our customers in Great Britain. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[The lack of available data means that it is difficult to properly assess the impact of the reduced availability of cred]]]

[[[it in NI, and also means that there is not sufficient visibility about whether banks are reaching their agreed lending targets. ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As noted above, Santander has increased its net lending to SMEs in Northern Ireland by 32% in the last year. Santander is currently lending £147m to SMEs in Northern Ireland. &#xa0;4.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Santander also notes that the British Bankers Association (BBA) has agreed to lead an industry initiative to increase the amount of publicly available data on bank lending in Northern Ireland. Santander refers the Committee to the BBA’s response for more detail on this matter. &#xa0;

[[[How is new lending recorded; how much ‘new’ lending recorded is actually made up of extensions or additions to existing loans; and what ]]]

[[[are banks actually doing compared t]]]

[[[o what they are advertising? ]]]&#xa0;4.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Santander has only been operating as a corporate bank in Northern Ireland for the last 3 years. As most of our loan facilities last for a 5 year period, we have not yet had any customer facilities expire which need renewing. Consequently, the vast majority of our lending recorded in Northern Ireland is new lending. &#xa0;

[[[ Bank of some branches in rural areas, are the interests of those living in more rural areas, particularly the elderly, sufficiently fulfilled by the banking structure as it currently stands? ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]5.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Santander UK will have 31 branches in Northern Ireland by the end of this year. This includes 22 branches which we would consider to be in rural areas. We have no plans to reduce the number of branches in Northern Ireland below this number. &#xa0;5.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Santander UK understands the importance of the branch network to our customers. While Santander has closed 6 branches in Northern Ireland over the last 18 months, it is important to note that every one of the branches has been in a financial centre where we have at least one other branch remaining. &#xa0;5.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Santander UK is an amalgamation of the ex Abbey, Bradford and Bingley and Alliance and Leicester Building Societies and as such we have a number of high streets where we have multiple branches.&#xa0;5.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Where we have closed branches, the customer facing staff have all transferred to the remaining branches in the area which we have, in turn, improved to accommodate all of our customers in the town. This exercise has shown us that we are able to provide a better service to our customers when we consolidate all of our staff into one, larger branch.&#xa0;5.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Alongside our branch network, Santander has an active “omni-channel” strategy to ensure that our customers can access our services in a variety of ways as suits their needs. This includes large domestic call centres for phone inquiries, a comprehensive online banking platform and a mobile banking app which was recently named best personal banking app in its category by mobile developer Xtreme Labs.&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;
