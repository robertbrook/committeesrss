defaultT
defaulthis is a success story for public health and the 
defaultheath service
default and it should be celebrated. But it does mean 
defaultthere is 
defaultrapidly increasing demand from the growing number of people living with long term, multiple conditions, at a time when the NHS budget is flat in real terms. 
defaultFor example the population
default of over 65s is projected to grow by 50 per cent over the next two decade
defaults.
default&#xa0;
default2.2 
defaultThe effect of lifestyle choices, including smoking, alcohol abuse and obesity, on public health and wellbeing have also increased pressures on the NHS. The cost for treating 
defaultdiseases associated with these lifestyle choices is estimated at a cumulative
default £17.9 billion 
defaulteach
default year -
default 
defaultalmost a 
defaultfifth
default of the annual NHS budget
default. 
defaultThey have also led to an increase in so
defaultme long-term conditions. For example, t
defaulthe NHS spends almost £10 billion each year on treating diabete
defaults, of which 80 per cent is spent
default on managing avoidable diabetic complications
default. 
default&#xa0;
default2.3 
defaultThe pressure resulting from these demographic changes
default is already apparent
default. The increased demand on accident and emergency services mean
defaults
default patients 
defaultare 
defaultfacing longer waiting 
defaulttimes 
defaultin many places.
default 
defaultDemographic
default changes have also 
defaultplaced increased pressure on the social care system. 
defaultLarge numbers of people are experiencing delays in being transferred to the right sort of care. This can be distressing for patients and has a significant financial cost. 
default&#xa0;
default2.4 
defaultThe NHS 
defaulttherefore need
defaults
default 
defaultto adapt
default. 
defaultIn this submission we argue 
defaultadaption
default involve
defaults
default 
defaultdeveloping services in
default the community and 
defaultorganising care 
defaultmore 
defaultaround an individual's needs. This will 
defaultmean
default integrated care
default, including joining up NHS and social care. 
defaultEqually the Government needs to find a long term solution to the funding problems which face social care. Significant long term changes are needed to improve the range and reach of social care so that people are supported to be as well and as independent as possible, for as long as they are able.
default&#xa0;
default2.5 
defaultMore needs to be done to manage the demand facing the NHS in order to lessen the pressures on the service. 
defaultA key part of this will be greater investment in p
defaultrevention and early intervention services.
default 
defaultWhile local authorities now commission 
defaultmost 
defaultpublic health services, there is still a role in this for the NHS. 
defaultSignificant initiatives led by both NHS providers and commissioners have strengthened early intervention efforts in areas such as psychiatric liaison, alcohol and falls prevention. However, our members have clearly stated this sort of work has often been driven by certain individuals and it is not yet something built into the NHS system. We must ensure these initiatives become the norm across the health service.
default&#xa0;
default2.6 
defaultWe 
defaultare calling
default for the introduction of services which aim to take a whole person and community approach to improving health. 
defaultThese could for example include a combination of 
defaultsmoking cessation, weight management, 
defaultor
default psychological well-being interventions such stress management
default.
default 
defaultNHS organisations and local authorities should also work together through health and wellbeing boards to provide wellness services which take a whole person and community approach to improving health.

default. 
defaultIt has also been shown to have a positive return on investment. 
default&#xa0;

default 
defaultThe NHS 
defaultalso 
defaultneeds to maximise the opportunities healthcare professionals have with individuals and communities to improve their health and well-being (the so-called “every contact counts” approach). We recommend that:

default 
defaultGood child health is essential to the future health of the adult population. However, England has one of the highest mortality rates in Europe for those aged 0 to 14. 
defaultThe level of obesity among children remains high, with 19 per cent of children aged ten to 11 years defined as obese, and continues to rise. 
defaultP
defaultlanned care for long term conditions 'gives cause for concern' with many preventable asthma admissions and poor diabetic control
default. Improving child health would include making a preventative sys
defaulttem a cross-government priority.
default 
defaultOur report 
defaultChildren and young people’s health and wellbeing in changing times
default 
defaultsets out in more detail the recommendations we have for improving child health. 
default&#xa0;
default2.1
default0
default 
defaultFor young people with long term conditions, the transition to adult health services is a difficult time. Transition needs to be built into care pathways as a process rather than a discrete event. Local leadership on improving transition is also needed, for example, through a designated transition lead in each local area and clinical champions within provider organisations.
default&#xa0;
default2.1
default1
default 
defaultDraft legislation on reform of provision for children and young people with Special Educational Needs includes provision for joint Education, Health and Care plans to secure personalised services across health, education and other relevant areas for children with a high level of need. For this policy to work well, all parties will need to understand the potential benefits of such policies and implement them in ways designed to secure these benefits. We were therefore pleased that pathfinders for this policy were extended, as it had been challenging for the NHS to engage with them during a period when PCTs were closing and CCGs becoming established. 
default&#xa0;default3. defaultIntegratingdefault care around the needs defaultofdefault the individualdefault&#xa0;
default3.1 
defaultPeople with long term conditions interact with the health service in a different way than those with a single episode of care, such as a broken leg. 
defaultThose with long term conditions will have more frequent contact with the NHS, often
default interacting with multiple
default parts of the system
default over a sustained period of time
default. 
defaultGiven many long term conditions cannot be "cured", the focus 
defaultwill be more
default 
defaulton
default managing the condition
default and helping people 
defaultto 
defaultstay as well as possible for as long as possible
default. 
default&#xa0;
default3.2 
defaultThis all means that the health service needs to interact in a different way 
defaultwith patients th
defaulta
defaultn in the past 
defaultand a key part of this will be to ensure that the various 
defaultparts of the system are joined up to ensure that the patients' interactions with the system (or 'care pathway') are properly coordinated. This approach needs to make better use of resources and improve people's experiences by delivering the right care in the right place. This greater integration of care
default needs to involve not just NHS services but also local authority provision, particularly social care
default. It also means engaging better with patients as people with an active role to play in improving and maintaining their own health, not simply passive recipients of care. 
defaultWe welcome the 
defaultnarrative
default for integrated care
default recently
default set out by National Voices, which is helpful in setting out what is meant by the term integration
default and the recent announcement by the Government on integration 'pioneer' sites. 
default&#xa0;
default3.3 
defaultA range of models have been developed by local leaders to fit local needs. 
defaultThe North West London Integra
defaultted Care pilot which we outline
default 
defaultlater in this submission is one example of the NHS implementing 
defaultan 
defaultinnovative model of care which meet
defaults
default the needs of those with long term conditions. 
defaultHowever, 
defaultmore
default 
defaultneed
defaults
default to be done to ensure there is widespread adoption of these models. 
defaultOur 
defaultprevious 
defaultjoint submission with ADASS and the Local Government Association to the Committee's public expenditure inquiry highlighted recommendations for ensuring this is the case. To help ensure integrated care is adopted at scale and pace 
defaultour recommendations include
default:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.4 
defaultWhile there are a number of examples of integrated care which have proven benefits, t
defaulthe evidence base 
defaultaround 
defaultwhich models work best in which context
default 
defaultand how integration can be priced 
defaultneeds to be strengthened
default. 
defaultA greater understanding of this 
defaultwill be essential for commissioners 
defaultas they
default need to ensure that services are evidence based and improve patient outcomes. There are particular challenges around potentially complicated procurement and 
defaultcontracting arrangements which will need to be worked through if models of integrated care are 
defaultto be 
defaultmore widely adopted. 
default&#xa0;
default3.5 
defaultIf properly supported
default in their development
default 
defaultthe new 
defaulth
defaultealth and wellbeing boards 
defaultcould 
defaultplay 
defaulta key role 
defaultin securing integrated care. The fastest progress towards making integration happen is being achieved by boards that are attempting to understand and influence the delivery as well as the commissioning of services. Joint working in which providers are actively involved in service design and development and work closely with commissioners to secure the outcomes needed, is beneficial. In response to the potential tensions this creates in terms of board function and governance some boards are experimenting with different options for involving providers.
default&#xa0;
default3.6 
defaultAs demonstrated below, s
defaultelf-care through technology is an increasingly important tool, allowing patients to mange their own care from home. Empowering a greater number of patients to manage their own 
defaultlong term 
defaultconditions is also benefiting frontline staff by freeing up more of their time for caring. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCase study –default defaultimdefaultproving care through defaulttelehealthdefault&#xa0;
defaultLiverpool Community Health has combined an integrated care model with 
defaulttelehealth
default to provide care for people with long term conditions. The aim is to reach patients with a chronic disease much earlier in the process and avoid admissions to hospitals by giving patients and carers greater control. 
default&#xa0;
defaultPatients who were identified as high risk were given a set-top box for their TV which transmitted data, such as heart rate and blood pressure, to a multidisciplinary health team, including a GP and community matron. The box allowed the team to monitor the data and make visits if there were any early warning signs of the patient's condition worsening. It led to a 73 per cent drop in emergency admissions for acute coronary syndrome and a 38 per cent reduction in bed days compared to previous years.
default&#xa0;
default3.7 
defaultIf people are to manage long term conditions more effectively then care will need to be 
defaultpersonalised
default around 
defaultpeople's
default individual needs
default.
default 
defaultPersonal health budgets could b
defaulte one way of doing this. 
defaultOur work shows that t
defaultake-up of personal health budgets should be driven by genuine demand from patients rather than quotas, learning the lessons from the continuing rollout of personal budgets in social care. 
defaultGood a
defaultdvice and support for patients will be essential.
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.8 
defaultConsideration could be given to joining
default up
default local authority personal budgets
default with personal health budget. Potentially this could enable integration at an individual, rather than structural level.
default 
defaultAs well as improving patient experience, a
defaultligning processes at the individual level, even if the staff, budgets and organisations remain separate, could save fro
defaultntline staff significant time.
default 
defaultThe joint NHS Confederation and ADASS briefing J
defaultoint personal budgets: a new solution to integrated care?
default considers further the issues that need to be examined before joint personal budgets could be used at scale.
default 
default&#xa0;
default4. defaultRedefaultdesigndefaulting services to meet the needs of defaultpeopledefault with long term conditionsdefault&#xa0;
default4.1 
defaultA system-wide approach is required to facilitate the necessary shift in the balance of care to local settings, improve care coordination and make better use of limited resources. This will require risks and rewards to be shared and organisational interests set aside, for the greater benefit of the local health economy. A major shift in resources is needed to enable the transfer of care into community settings. 
defaultCommunity services 
defaultare
default often
default better suited to the needs of people with long term conditions as they enable staff to develop a holistic view of the needs of each individual and provide personalised
default and
default continuous, rather than episodic, care.
default&#xa0;
default4.2 
defaultWe also need to
default develop payment systems that 
defaultincentivise
default prevention, early intervention, early supported discharge and more integrated working.
default We would encourage the government, NHS England and 
defaultother leaders in the health service to make this a key priority. 
default&#xa0;
default4.3 
defaultWith central Government funding unlikely to significantly increase in coming years, the NHS will need to make best use of the money already available to it in order to invest redesigning services. This could mean redistributing funds as 
defaultdone
default in the below example
default of an integrated care model
default, or considering using some of the money curre
defaultntly held in contingency funds.
default We need transparency around the reinvestment of existing savings such as 
defaultfrom the ring fenced 2 per cent of clinical commissioning groups budgets or 
default30 per cent management tariff into demand management. For example, the North West London integrated care pilot, whose start up costs were funded by savings from the marginal tariff, has already begun to reduce admissions to accident and emergency departments, specifically for older people with diabetes. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCase study – The North West London Integrated Care Pilot (ICP)default&#xa0;
defaultThe North West London Integrated Care Pilot (ICP) was launched in June 2011 and brings together more than 100 general practices, 2 acute care trusts, 5 primary care trusts, 2 mental health care trusts, 3 community health trusts, 5 local authorities, and 2 voluntary sector organizations (Age UK and Diabetes UK) to improve the coordination of care for a pilot population of 550 000 people. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe ICP was developed in response to variations in the quality of care and a rising deficit across the local health economy. The clinicians involved decided two areas of focus for integrated care: people older than 75 years and those with diabetes. These groups were experiencing a high level of avoidable admissions and variable care, there was known best practice and improved outcomes would be measureable.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe ICP developed a unique model of clinicians working together in multi-disciplinary groups within a multi-disciplinary system. The multi disciplinary group (MDG) risk stratified the patients identified for the pilot, developed shared protocols for care across organisations, discussed these protocols and developed care plans with patients, mapped available care and addressed gaps in provision, introduced case conferences for patients with particularly complex needs or significant problems, and reviewed overall performance of the pilot.
default&#xa0;
default£7m investment was provided by London SHA channelling the funds from the 30% marginal tariff on 'excess' emergency admissions to hospital. This provided for an operational team, an information tool (to support risk stratification, care planning, sharing of medical information and evaluation), care coordination and incentive for providers to save. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSome benefits have been seen relatively early in the pilot, though it is anticipated the full benefits would become apparent over a 5-10 year timescale. Based on analysis of the impact to date, the ICP hopes to reduce emergency admissions for people over 75 with diabetes by 10%. Patients are 
defaultalso experiencing better coordinated care across different providers. The aspiration for the pilot is to scale up to the whole local population, focusing on the 20% that drive 80% of cost.
default&#xa0;
default4.4 
defaultThere is widespread agreement that 
defaultmore care in 
defaultpeople's homes and communities, wherever clinically appropriate, is the right approach
default and can more effectively 
defaulthelp
default support those with long-term 
defaultconditions
default. Shifting care away from an acute setting and into the community was the second most frequently chosen priority area for respondents to the NHS Confederation's 
default2012 
defaultmembers survey at 63 per cent. A survey published by the Department of Health in 2012 found that 66 per cent of the members of the public polled in the survey agreed that moving services into the community can raise standards
default. 
default&#xa0;
default4.5 
defaultAs outlined in our 2013 briefing on the role for community healthcare in transforming local care
default, the community health sector is already driving the transformation of local care systems. Innovative community healthcare providers are enabling people to stay healthy and independent and avoid crises that lead to unplanned hospital admissions.
default 
defaultCommunity services are moving the focus away from traditional models of healthcare in acute settings to nurse-led rehabilitation in, or closer to, peoples' homes, the provision of 'hospital at home' services such as diagnostics and chemotherapy, and community-based end of life care. Central to the community health model are prevention, early intervention and enabling timely discharge or transfer from hospital to improve recovery. 
defaultThe below case study highlights the strength of a community 
defaultapproach to a long term condition
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCase study – community service for respiratory diseasedefaultA community-based respiratory team was set up in Hammersmith and Fulham to improve care for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The service put in place specialist support to primary care services, workplace-based training, a community based rehabilitation programme and community clinics. It also supports patients after their discharge from hospital and helped them self-manage their care. Benefits from this include reduced first and follow-up appointments, saving £170,000, 19 per cent reduction in admission to hospital for COPD and a 66 per reduction in readmissions. 
default&#xa0;
default4.6 
defaultMore needs to 
defaultbe done to achieve the scale and pace of change in order to meet the challenges of a long term condition
default. The Government 
defaultand national bodies 
defaultne
defaulteds to examine how the current 
defaultw
defaultay NHS organisations are paid for their activity can be reformed to incentivise shifting more care into the community. The NHS also needs to redesign the way we currently plan and provide services, in order to shift more care from a hospital setting into the community and people's own homes. Such an approach will improve the quality of care provided to patients with long term conditions and has the potential to save money. 
default&#xa0;
default4.7 
defaultIt is important that a 
defaultcollaborative, 
defaultwhole system approach is taken to commissioning the services needed to support people to manage their long term conditions. Clinical Commissioning
default 
defaultGroups (CCGs) cannot do this alone. They need to be supported at a system level to work with local authority commissioners and NHS England. 
defaultWe remain concerned about the lack of clarity around 
defaulthow CCGs will work jointly with specialist commissioning housed in NHS England. We urge NHS England to set its plans out as a matter of urgency. 
default&#xa0;
default4.8 
defaultEqually secondary providers 
defaultand commissioners 
defaultwill need to work
default 
defaultmore closely 
defaulttogether
default to play an active role in facilitating care in community settings and enabling people with long-term conditions to self manage. In addition, commissioners will need 
defaultto demonstrate that the way they are commissioning achieves good outcomes for patients. Good evidence which demonstrates that care in
default community settings improve
defaults
default patient outcomes and save
defaults
default money in the long run
default will therefore be essential. 
default&#xa0;
default4.9 
defaultIn the face of potentially unpopular decisions, health and wellbeing boards have an important advocacy role in making the case for change, especially where service reconfiguration and service closure is involved. However, though significant advances have been made at this early stage of the 
defaultBoards' development, there remain considerable challenges to realising this potential. Board members will need strong communication and political skills. In addition, most boards already have a partnership of shared respect and understanding, but to effectively support service redesign they will need to go beyond this to become a cohesive, unified body in which overall strategic priorities are put above personal or organisational interests.
default              
default5.defaultThe interaction between mental health conditions and long-term physical health conditionsdefault&#xa0;
default5.1 People with long-term physical health conditions will often have psychological and 
defaultemotional needs resulting from
default 
defaultillness-related symptoms, 
defaultdisability
default associated with the physical illness, 
defaultor
default the impact of living with more than one physical condition at any time. 
defaultFor example, d
defaultepression is at least twice as common in people with diabetes, with an estimated 41 per cent of people with diabetes having poor psychological wellbeing, and many with
default 
defaultpsychological needs that do not meet the criteria for a formal diagnosis. Evidence shows that depression exacerbates the complications and adverse consequences of diabetes,
default 
defaultin part because patients 
defaulthave difficulties with 
defaultmanage their diabetes. 
default&#xa0;
default5.2 The NHS therefore needs to ensure that services are designed and delivered around the needs of an individual as a whole. It is important the mental health and the re
defaultst of the system work in a joined 
defaultup way, particularly in developing and delivering integrated care for people with long term conditions. 
default&#xa0;
default5
default.3
default 
defaultFailing to recognise the link has
default economic costs - 
defaulth
defaultealthcare costs are higher and productivity is lower due to reduced work performance, increased absenteeism and withdrawal from the labour force. 
defaultFor example, i
defaultn the UK, individuals with co-morbid depression and diabetes are four times more likely to have difficulties in self-managing their health and seven times more likely to have days off work
default compared to people with diabetes alone
default.
default 
defaultEvidence shows
default that a
defaultddressing psychological needs
default of diabetic people through a range of interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or anti-depressant therapy include: reduced psychological distress and anxiety; improved mood and quality of life; improved relationships with health professionals and significant others; and improved eating-related b
defaultehaviours such as purging 
defaultand body image symptoms
default&#xa0;
default5.4
default 
defaultWe believe there is considerable potential to improve quality of life and quality of care, and to generate service efficiencies and cost savings in this area.
default 
defaultOur Mental Health Network has published a 
defaultdocument
default which sets out the interactions between a number of physical and mental long term conditions. The document details a 
defaultrange
default of case studies 
defaultwhich show
defaults
default the work a large number of

defaultNHS organisations are 
defaultdoing to address

defaultand the ben

default&#xa0;
default5.5
default The report highlights that m
defaultany individuals do not receive care that addresses both their physical and psychological needs. More needs to be done to recognise this and treat the whole person
default,
default rather than specific conditions. 
defaultThe report argues for a shift in the way we provide care to address this, and in particular more emphasis 
defaultput 
defaulton 
defaultthe 
defaultself management of long term conditions. It also echoes the
default 
defaultrecommendation
default made
default by the Royal College of General Practitioners and the Royal College of Psychiatry 
defaultfor
default all primary care staff to have psychological awareness training in order to provide whole person care.
