[[[What is the rationale for the Government’s proposals to devolve to a local level decision-making on transport expenditure? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Government’s approach? Are there better ]]]

[[[models?]]]&#xa0;1.              The Governments proposals were based on the rationale of providing local areas with the flexibility to determine transport priorities that meet local needs and lever in economic development. Fewer funding pots meant a less silo based approach to transport funding and a more integrated approach to solutions.&#xa0;2.              For the period beyond 2015, Major Scheme funding and prioritisation was devolved to Local Transport Bodies (LTB) constituted of Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEP), Integrated Transport Authorities (ITA) and other key stakeholders. In 2013, the requirement to determine transport as part of each LEP Strategic Economic Plans is the right course; however it is of concern that the only significant funding sources going into Single Local Growth Fund (SLGF) comes from the Department for Transport (DfT) though Major Schemes and Integrated Transport Block funding. This could mean transport funding non-transport infrastructure and more Government departments should contribute. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Advantages&#xa0;3.              The West Midlands believes the approach offered the following advantages:&#xa0;Disadvantages&#xa0;4.              The West Midlands believes the approach offered the following disadvantages:

[[[Q2. ]]]

[[[Do local bodies (including local authorities, local enterprise partnership]]]

[[[s, passenger transport executives, integrated transport authorities and local transport boards) have the capacity to assess, prioritise and deliver local transport schemes? What would the optimum delivery body look like?]]]5.              Yes. Local areas do have the capacity to assess, prioritise and deliver local transport schemes. Governments original rationale of devolution was to empower local areas and allow flexible, dynamic transport government and delivery structures reflective of local economic geographies.6.              However, Government does appear to have contradicted this approach by imposing new structures and bodies rather than allowing local determination towards transport. Whilst, the prioritisation of Major Schemes by the three LTBs covering the West Midlands metropolitan area is considered to have been largely have been successful in terms of type of schemes and strategic policy alignment, their role has now been absorbed into the LEP through SLGF As strategic transport planning and scheme priorities will be determined by LEPs, they need to be resources to undertake this work. 7.              Any part of the Metropolitan Area effectively has 5 different organisations undertaking similar transport functions. In practice, the differing remits, funding and covering geographies is likely to lead to inefficiencies between strategic planning, development and delivery of transport schemes and initiatives.8.              With LEPs covering differing geographical areas, there is a need for strategic transport governance structures to ensure coordination activity. To that end, the West Midlands Metropolitan Area has self determined that transport governance should be undertaken by the seven leaders of the District Authorities as the ITA. This will ensure a closer alignment between the economic development responsibilities of LEPs and the integrated transport responsibilities of the West Midlands ITA. The arrangements presently operate in shadow form and are presently being considered by the DfT.9.              In relation to funding, the West Midlands welcomed devolution of major scheme funding. However, the pro-rata nature of the allocations reflects population not need of area. This means funding of large strategic schemes, such as rail/ light rail and/ or bus rapid transit schemes is less feasible and this is discussed further in question 7.

[[[What is the best way of dealing with major transport schemes that cross local authority boundaries or have wider regional impact?]]]10.              In the Metropolitan Area, strategic cross boundary transport planning is vital and reflects the realities of transport patterns and requirements of an urban area both for internal cross boundary movements and wider within the economic catchment of the metropolitan area.11.              In the West Midlands, the ITA presently is tasked by the Local Transport Act (2008) to undertake strategic cross boundary transport planning whilst decision making on Major Schemes is now undertaken by 3 separate LEPs who have a specific focus on promoting economic development. As the District Leaders sit on both the LEP and ITA they will be coordinating transport across the West Midlands. 

[[[Q4. ]]]

[[[How effectively do local bodies work with each other and with Government de]]]

[[[partments and national transport agencies?]]]&#xa0;12.              The West Midlands believes that local bodies largely do work well together, reflecting historical working processes and relationships. However, there must be a stronger responsibility for national transport agencies, such as the Highways Agency and Network Rail, to work closely with local bodies such as ITAs and LEPs to ensure alignment between local needs and national investment programmes. &#xa0;13.              National transport investment programmes should be fully aligned to supporting local areas. However, we believe there is a disconnection between local needs and how national investment programmes are developed. &#xa0;14.              For example, in Control Period 5 the West Midlands will benefit from only one named scheme (Walsall – Rugeley Electrification) in Network Rails investment programme whilst local rail priorities such as Water Orton rail corridor and the Camp Hill Chords remain unfunded impacting on the ability to support economic development, address congestion and connect people to jobs. &#xa0;15.              In relation to the Highways Agency, local priorities such as Smart Motorways on the M5 (between the M6 Interchange and J4a) through the core of the Black Country (as identified by the West Midlands Metropolitan Freight Strategy) also remains unfunded, leading to impacts to journey reliability, connectivity to markets, congestion and the environment.&#xa0;

[[[Do the current funding streams for major local transport schemes meet the needs of ]]]

[[[local authorities? How do current funding streams compare with previous arrangements?]]]&#xa0;16.              As previously stated, the West Midlands has seen a significant reduction in capital funding blocks. Between 2009/10 and 2011/12 capital allowances was cut by 47%.. The West Midlands welcomes devolution and removal of funding allocation ring fencing, however the ability to support economic growth, tackle congestion, connect people to jobs and support environmental objectives will be directly linked the size of funding available. Each of these latter objectives supports the government objective of supporting economic growth. &#xa0;17.              However there is considerable inequity between London and the rest of the UK. For 2014/15 all transport authorities across England outside of London will be allocated £2.084Bn (£1.664bn Capital; £420M revenue) compared to the £2.4bn London is to be allocated by the DfT. This significant inequity in transport funding distribution means that for 2011/12 the West Midlands had £198 per head for transport compared to £644 per head in London. Efforts to rebalance the UK economy will be undermined not supported if the spend on transport per head outside of London is not brought closer to the levels enjoyed by London.&#xa0;18.              Investment in any transport scheme is a highly efficient approach to supporting the economy as materials are purchased, jobs are created in building the scheme and it improves productivity of the wider economy. Whilst the Government has recognised this and has increased funding for national agencies to historical high levels for the period 2015-19, local transport funding (covering Major Schemes, Integrated Transport and Maintenance Blocks) for 2015-19 is £2.244bn per annum compared to £1.968Bn in 2009/10 an increase of 14% or the equivalent of 1.9% per annum.&#xa0;19.              Finally, the West Midlands has developed the Local Connectivity Package (LCP) which outlines an integrated approach to maximising the economic benefits of High Speed Two. The £2bn programme of schemes and interventions would double the economic benefits of HS2. The West Midlands wants the national transport investment programmes and priorities to be reflective of the LCP. If Network Rail was to therefore fund the rail schemes required in the LCP then half of the LCP would be funded by Network Rail. &#xa0;20.              The other half could be provided by Government as it is committed to maximising the economic benefits of HS2. Government could allocate additional resource to the West Midlands. For example, if the West Midlands received an extra £50 per person on transport spending this would total an extra £135m per year. This additional money; allocated per year - over a ten year period; would help fund the other half of the LCP.  &#xa0;

[[[What impact will the devolution in 2015 of funding to ]]]

[[[Local Transport Bodies and the introduction of the Single Local Growth Fund have?]]]&#xa0;21.              The SLGF in principal should be a strong start to address the underinvestment in local transport as discussed in previous answers. The £2bn per annum pot is a welcomed start, however given the competitive nature of the fund, the government still retains control over funding allocations – against the premise of local devolution. &#xa0;22.              We note that Lord Heseltine’s “No Stone Unturned” report identified the potential to devolve £49bn to local areas, a transformational level of resources which could regenerate and transform local areas and allow for locally driven long term planning and development.&#xa0;23.              However, the SLGF must be the start of a wider process of transport funding devolution not the end of the process. Crucially, only the DfT is contributing significant Government spend, other department should provide equivalent resources to maximise the benefits and opportunities of the SLGF.&#xa0;24.              A more equitable solution would be for the complete devolution of the SLGF with particular focus of resource on metropolitan areas urban areas which are often the focal point of journeys, hubs of economic activity, population growth and therefore the location where investment in transport issues will generate the largest benefits. &#xa0;25.              The West Midlands notes with caution that if SEP/ SLGF awarded monies are not allocated over a fixed medium term process (5-10 years) then the ability to plan or bring schemes forward to meet development opportunities will be severely restricted, especially if allocations are confirmed on an annual basis.

[[[Q7. How can local authorities attract greater investment from the private sector for the delivery and maintenance of local transport ]]]

[[[infrastructure? What scope is there for the use of alternative funding streams?]]]&#xa0;26.              Whilst the Government’s funding for transport will support investment in smaller scale schemes (&lt;£20M approx local transport schemes) and larger schemes (&gt;£500M approx national transport scheme), there is a gap in the ability to fund ‘mid-range’ schemes i.e. £20M - £500M locally, vital for transformational changes to local area economies. Such mid-range schemes mostly cover rapid transit (light rail and bus), rail schemes or stations. In the West Midlands, the following schemes would fall into this category:

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Camp Hill Chords]]]: A £200M (approx) scheme which would facilitate the introduction of rail services to residential areas of Birmingham which are home to 250,000 people providing them with access to jobs, education and other key services whilst reducing road congestion. The scheme would generate £150M approx GVA for the regional economy and support the creation of 3220 jobs in the West Midlands.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Wednesbury to Brierley Hill Metro]]]: a £270M (approx) Midland Metro light rail extension from existing Metro Line One through the heart of the Black Country acting as a catalyst for regeneration, land use changes and economic development. The area has poor transport accessibility and connectivity to the wider conurbation and particularly Birmingham city centre. The scheme would generate £165M GVA for the regional economy and support the creation of 3,600 jobs&#xa0;27.              Funding of these specific schemes and general ‘mid-range’ transport schemes cannot be done within the funding allocations of Major Schemes, whilst the multi- infrastructure nature of the SLGF means that funding from that competitive pot is unlikely. &#xa0;28.              This means funding opportunities for these types of schemes will focus on sovereign/ private investment funds, council tax levy increases (noting the Governments statutory requirements for a local referendum), borrowing, Tax Incremental Financing or private sector contributions through mechanisms such as the Community Infrastructure Levy. &#xa0;29.              The West Midlands notes that generally small schemes (&lt;£20M) and larger schemes (£500M&gt;) are not exposed to such risks, as Government provides the capital for delivery through local transport funding or national transport agency which removes risk or funding uncertainly. However, this is not the case for such mid-range £20M-£500M schemes which require the promoting local authority or private sector to take on cost or price risk. Risk is therefore priced into schemes, inflating costs or deflating returns/benefits.&#xa0;30.              Therefore, Government should look to address how to deliver such mid-range schemes. Ideally there should be a consistent approach to funding whereby greater levels of capital is available to fund such schemes, providing equality with the low-risk funding certainty of the national transport agencies/ organisations. &#xa0;31.              The SLGF offers the opportunity to pool resources but the levels of funding presently allocated are not receptive to the delivery of these types of schemes alone and would need to be completed by further capital funding, including locally generated funding. &#xa0;32.              The West Midlands notes the successful use of Council Tax funding for transport schemes in metropolitan areas such as Greater Manchester, however presently such an approach would be included in calculations to increase council tax by more than 2% and the subsequent requirement by Government for a local referendum. The specific requirement should be amended by Government if local areas self determine this funding approach as an aspiration.&#xa0;33.              Without the levels of capital resources required to deliver such transformational schemes available in the SLGF nor can they be practically raised locally, metropolitan areas are missing out on the economic, congestion, environmental and health benefits of these schemes, meaning our capability to cater for a growing population and economy is impacted upon.&#xa0;34.              However, with such a funding model in place, the lower cost of risk built into financial models and decision making by local areas and the private sector would be reduced by creating an environment of greater funding certainty to unlock investment to create jobs and growth. &#xa0;35.              The West Midlands again highlights that an extra £50 per person on transport spending would total an extra £135m per year and would fund the other half of the LCP required to double the economic benefits of HS2 across the West Midlands. This would be more akin to the powers and approaches used by Transport for London to the benefit of the London economy and population.&#xa0;36.              However, such an approach should not discount the opportunity of private sector investment. However, how such investment is secured needs to be altered. A single large capital pot for funding of mid-range transport schemes means the public sector could fund and deliver a mid-range transport scheme which could then be sold to the private sector or public sector pension funds as a long term concession after a pre-determined number of years. &#xa0;37.              Once the public sector underwriting period was complete and revenues known, growth and operating costs could be modelled and valued with certainty. The capital raised from the concession could then be recycled back to the strategic transport fund for other mid-range transport schemes. &#xa0;38.              After the concession period was over, a reselling of the asset could occur. However, this approach requires a dedicated capital pot to pump prime the process and Government should empower and resource local areas above the present levels of the SLGF to achieve this and generate economic benefits both locally and nationally.&#xa0;

[[[Q8. How clear are the lines of accountability for local decision making on transport expenditure?]]]&#xa0;39.              Presently, the West Midlands feels there a strong lines of accountability, however in the spirit of devolution, local areas should be allowed to develop appropriate structures to undertaken government requirements rather than Government imposing structures.&#xa0;December 2013Page 6&#xa0;
