"&#xa0;&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Sherborne Transport Action Group (TIC 107)\n&#xa0;\nThe Sherborne Transport Action Group (STAG) aims to improve transport provision for the people of Sherborne and the surrounding villages, particularly to help those \nwithout access to a car and to encourage car owners to use other modes.\n&#xa0;\nSTAG welcomes all who have an interest in its objects.  Members may include representatives of town and parish councils, transport-related organisations, transport-providers and other\n interested members of the community.\n&#xa0;\nThis submission was agreed by STAG at its meeting on 19 September 2013.&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe great majority of enquiries into local transport have concentrated almost wholly on the context of cities and large towns.  We welcome the \nemphasis of the current enquiry .  We hope, however, that it will include not only areas which are truly isolated, but also the rural areas which cannot be regarded as isolated, but where the dispersal of population raises issues entirely different from th\nose of the large urban areas.  Sherborne\n,\n with a population of 10,000 and surrounding villages\n of a few hundred, \ncome\ns\n firmly in this category.\n \n&#xa0;\n1.  How do Government and local authorities identify demand for passenger transport in isolated communities (including rural and urban areas and island communities)?2.  To what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers (e.g. people with disabilities, older people, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?3.  What are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities? How can these challenges be overcome?4.  How effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?&#xa0;\n5.  To what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive transport services?6.  What are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities? How can these services be made more affordable?&#xa0;\n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \nAnnex 1&#xa0;Relation of Public Transport to Development PlanningProvision of public\n transport ought to be assessed in the overall context of planning.\n  This is made more difficult by the fact that transport is a County re\ns\nponsibility, while planning lies with the Districts.\n \n Active integration is needed.\nThe current criteria for the crea\ntion of Local Plans call for assessment, in deciding how rural areas should develop, of the overall effect on the cost of services to a community. The absence of accessible public transport will increase those costs. It has the effect of excluding many of \nthe very elderly, who are present in increasing numbers, from any community or business centre which is less than a very few miles from their home (anecdotal evidence from the property market suggests 7 miles). This alienation, once it has occurred, is irr\neversible. \nThere is a compelling case for providing housing in the villages for younger people so that schools and other facilities remain viable.  However, i\nt would be perverse to decree an increase in the need for distributed social/affordable housing i\nn isolated rural communities without costing in a long-\nterm subsidy for transport. T\nhose with a real need may be expected to have a greater requirement for public transport to access not only retail but increasingly necessary social and health services. Wi\nthout a transport subsidy, the effect would otherwise be to create rural communities which are increasingly made up of the relatively wealthy middle aged, whose contribution to local costs is currently limited by the absurdly low top band of Council Tax. \nThe relative cost to local government of servicing those of the population who are in fact frail, immobile or poor would therefore be reduced by not encouraging these people to live in isolated communities.  But it must be questioned whether this would be \nsocially acceptable.\n&#xa0;                                                                                                                                            Annex 2&#xa0;&#xa0;Impact of the over-60 Concessionary Fare Scheme&#xa0;There are very few people who fully understand the Concessionary Fare Scheme.\n  We have encountered firm statements from local authority representatives which are i\nn \nflat \ncontradiction with the actual situation.\n  However, several factors stand out:\n&#xa0;\n1.  The scheme was introduc\ned on the basis that it would be fully funded by central government.  While one recognises the right of a government to vary the undertakings of its \npredecessor, it is deeply regret\nable that \n'\ngovernment\n' (of whatever party)\n has reneged on this and thereby \ndestroyed the foundations of the scheme.\n  Given the constraints on local authority funding, the reduction in central provision means that the operators are squeezed.\n  The original maxim that operators should neither gain nor lose by the scheme is no longer being honoured.\n&#xa0;\n2.  The basis of calculating reimbursement is extremely coarse\n, with a single reimbursement rate whatever the length of journey.\n  Some authorities \nwork on an 'average fare' across all\n of an operator's routes.  The reimbursement rate is thus \ndominated by\n short urban routes\n \n(the large majority)\n and is wholly inadequate for the long rural routes.  This results\n \nin a \nperverse \ntransfer of funds from long r\nural routes to short urban routes, contrary to the economic stresses.\n&#xa0;\n3.  Since the reimbursement rate is based on the average of cash fares (often a tiny minority of passengers) there is an incentive to keep those cash fares high and to \navoid offering an\ny\n discounted fares such as off-peak \no\nr promotional periods. \n This militates against attracting new fare-paying passengers.\n&#xa0;\n4. There is widespread evidence that many passengers would be prepared to pay a modest fare rather than having entirely free travel,\n if this would secure the future of a route.  However, \nsuch flexibility is not permitted\n under the rules of the national scheme.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
