defaultWritten evidence submitted by defaultDr Kevin Maddersdefault (ESA021)defaultProfile and declaration of interestdefault1. I am a space policy consultant and visiting professor of Space Policy and Law at KU Leuven and of Information Society Law at King’s College London. I have been involved in space affairs for over 25 years, including several as an ESA official. I have acted as expert to the European Commission and ESA on space policy formation and co-organized the European Space Policy Workshops at KU Leuven which preceded and then reviewed the European Space Policy that was adopted in 2007. I served on the BNSC European Affairs Advisory Board, on which I was among those calling for a UK space agency. I am the author of 
defaultA New Force at a New Frontier
default, which sought to unravel what had been termed the European space sector’s “intimidating complexity”. The book, which includes major UK space developments, also explored governance issues, an inquiry developed in later debate (see References). Finally, I am an evaluator for EU Framework Programme Space Calls.

defaultMy aim with this evidence is to address what seem to me the main governance issues raised by the inquiry, not to provide an individual position on each question.

defaultI declare that I both advise and contract with governmental and private entities, in particular through Systemics Network International, of which I am managing partner. This evidence is, however, submitted in a personal capacity. I am subject to some confidentiality constraints

defaultThe return of serious UK commitment to space and its implicationsdefault4
default. The Committee’s inquiry is very timely. Its primary focus is of course on UK interests. And those interests have witnessed a transformation over the past decade, culminating in 
defaultboosts to UK funding in ESA in 2008 and
default 2012, the creation of the UK Space Agency, and formation of a strategic industrial and research cluster for space around Harw
defaultell –
default the site since 2009 of an applications-oriente
defaultd ESA Establishment. 
defaultBritain is taking its place again at the top table in European space
default and
default is set to become one of the top three investors in ESA over the timeframe 2013-2018. A well-targeted contribution under ELIPS will furthermore see genuine UK participation in the International Space Station programme. These developments of course complement major existing strengths in space applications and science, while the British flair for innovation is 
defaultexemplified
default by the Reaction Engines’ Skylon project.
default5
default. 
defaultI join many from the space community in welcoming this transformation, and 
defaultI will not dwell o
defaultn the period that preceded it
default. This has been covered in my own work and in others’.  The focus wit
defaulth space is now
default on innovation for growth within a wider S&amp;T policy aimed at revamping the UK economic model. This clearly accords with UK long-term interests and rightly attracts good cross-party support. But the change in policy cannot wipe away overnight the legacy of the partial UK disengagement from space over previous decades: The UK Space Agency remains fairly small, its proportion of funding going to ESA is high in relation to the national programme, and, within ESA funding, it is striking that the UK, unlike France, Germany or Italy, is not
default prominent in
default itself thrusting one or more major 
defaultR&amp;D mission 
defaultprogrammes forward.
default6
default. The point here is that the UK has still much to do if it wants to complete its transformation in space
default and thereby reap the full rewards this expanding sector offers
default. 
defaultThe UK 
defaultParliament will have a key role in this respect, not only in supporting the UK Space Agency as it develops and 
defaultin 
defaultconducting much-needed 
defaultpro-competitive 
defaultreform of the Outer Space Act, but in encouraging programmes and commercial initia
defaulttives that can place 
defaultEurope
default and the UK at
default the vanguard of space development. 
defaultSkylon may come into question here, as may entirely new prospects such as asteroid mining, so far only being targeted only by American companies. But, whatever the UK itself does, it is plain that its capacity to go it alone in space will 
defaultalways 
defaultremain limited. It is also difficult to conceive that the
default UK, whatever the outcome of a
default referendum on EU membership, will have much reason to change horses from the European space structures it has become so deeply embedded in since the early 1960s.
default7
default. Against this background, it becomes vital for the UK to consolidate its own position in space within a favourab
defaultle European environment
default. And this environment, as the Committee has realized in opening its inquiry, is changing fundamentally due to the rising importance of the EU in the space field
default,
default even before the change made by the Lisbon Treaty that explicitly gave the EU space policy 
defaultand programmatic competence and
default freedom to establish “appropriate relations” with ESA.
default8
default. The consequences for e
defaultach country of this 
defaultchange in the European space landscape are profound. But my above remarks already indicate that the UK’s profile in ESA is not currently one that need bind
default its hands – a different situation than that of 
defaulta country
default like Germany, which has a 
defaultgreater vested interest in the ESA status quo. 
defaultI shall return to the opportunity this flexibility offers towards the end of this evidence.
default9
default. 
defaultI believe it unlikely the UK will leave the EU,
default but 
defaultone must still allow for this possibility and I do so
default in the following remarks
default. If it were to happen, the effects of withdrawal within the EU would probably be mainly budgetary for space, but not structural. The UK would be placed in a similar position to either Norway or Switzerland. Accommodations will be required for those countries under any governance reform, as the European Commission recognizes in its Communication COM 2012 671 (hereafter the “2012 Communication”).
defaultThe paradigm shift in EU-ESA relationsdefault10
default. While the UK in 2013 contributes less than 10% to ESA’s coffers, income from the EU is over 21%. If it were an ESA Member State, the EU would therefore already be ESA’s third largest contributor. But the EU is of course not a Member State, and is not allowed to be under the ESA Convention. The “third party” funding it passes through ESA is, moreover, different in kind (mainly procurement for utilization purposes rather than for major R&amp;D). And the EU spends further sums on European space research and applications that do not pass through ESA. It is true that these sums are currently relatively low but are set to increase under the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020. The total the EU currently plans for space under the MFF is some €11.5 billion. When ESA was founded, it was zero. Space was also practically nowhere on the Commission’s radar. Today, it is an integral part of numerous EU policies and has made it into both the EU’s charter and European Council business.
defaultThe current EU-ESA relationship and the impact of the Lisbon Treatiesdefault11
default. This game-changing development was foreseeable from the time of the 1986 Single European Act (SEA), which endorsed a European Community R&amp;D competence, and 
defaultfrom
default moves that culminated in the 1992 Maastricht Treaty. The first Communication by the European Commission on space indeed did not take long to follow (1988) and made claims whose chief political tenets of legitimacy, democratic accountability etc., one finds repeated in the 2012 Communication. A European Space Policy for the EU, ESA and their combined Member States was then arrived at, fitfully, in 2007
default. This
default underpinned a common and evolving architecture, which was then in turn endorsed in the Lisbon Treaty but le
defaultft unsolved 
defaultkey issues of institutional convergence already plain to several commentators from the SEA onwards. Supported by an inter-institutional framework agreement only from 2004, 
defaultdialogue and cooperation between the EU and ESA nevertheless slowly but surely
default grew
default across the entire period.
default12
default. In retrospect, a number of things stand out from this thumbnail history. First, it was ESA Member States which showed the greatest caution towards the kind “rapprochement” the 2012 Communication advocates. I have witnessed this first-hand over the entire period in question and it is pertinent here to mention that, based on our work in ESA, my colleague Walter Thiebaut and I suggested, in an article entitled “Two Europes in One Space”
default,
default an agreement between ESA and the European Community to facilitate institutional
default convergence. This seemed 
defaulta 
defaultself-evident need, and certain to
default take time and care to work 
defaultout. But in the event it took 
defaulttwelve years
default to arrive at the 2004 framework agreement; it took less than 
defaultten
default to place men on the Moon. Meanwhile, the ESA Executive has taken some courageous positions on the relations that should prevail between the EU and ESA. In its long-term perspective document
default aimed at
default ministers, 
defaultAgenda 2011
default, the ESA Director General grasped the nettle and proposed “to make ESA become an Agency of the EU”. His current 
defaultAgenda 2015
default recal
defaultls this proposal but notes 
default“this perspective was challenged by Member States”.
default13
default. I draw the Committee’s attention to this, because it is often thought that the EU is involved in some kind of hostile take-over of ESA. This is plainly not the case. While serving its Member States, each institution is ultimately the steward of the general European interest. And the ESA Executive is i
defaultn a position to understand 
defaultin terms of programmes and their 
defaultmanagement 
defaultthe drag on Europe’s potential that results from unnecessary an
defaultd
default protracted
default institutional bifurcation, whereas the signs
default 
defaultpointing to ESA
default one day becoming an EU agency 
defaultare
default unmistakeable. As a good manager, ESA therefore wants to clarify this issue to be able to get on with its real work of delivering its part of a world-class European space programme in concert with national
default and EU
default programmes. And here it is important to note that this, apparently, is the driving motive behind the 
defaultPolitical Declaration
default endorsed by the ESA ministerial Council in November 2012 in its Resolution No. 4, to which I w
defaultould recommend the Committee 
defaultgive
defaults
default its attention
default alongside the 2012 Communication
