"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Shelter&#xa0;Summary&#xa0;1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nShelter welcomes the opportunity to submit evidence to the \nWork and Pensions\n Select Committee on the\n significant reforms\n that have taken place in the welfare system over the past three years\n. More than \na \nmillion people a year come to us for advice and support via our website, helpline \nand network of face-to-\nface services. Our evidence is rooted in the experiences of people we help every day, many of whom \nare extremely worried about housing costs and \nwill be deeply affected by these changes. \n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAt a time when so many are struggling to make ends meet, losing a j\nob or a serious illness is all it takes to tip people into a spiral that could end in homelessness.\n&#xa0;\nHaving access to a safety net can make all the difference\n,\n y\net the\nse reforms \nhave cut the\n safety net back so much that if the worst happens families might n\not be able to get the help and support they need to stay in their homes and get back on their feet. \n \n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis submission \nrelates to\n the most detrimental \nof the \nhousing\n related\n welfare \nreforms\n:\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe \nrestriction of\n the Local Housing Allowance\n (LHA)\n rates means low income households are increasingly struggling to find af\nfordable private rented housing\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe \nremoval of the 13 week protection\n will\n mean\n m\nany renters who lose their job\n will \nno longer have a grace period in which they can stay in their hom\ne while seeking a new job\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe\n proposals for the \nalternative to direct payments\n \nfor Universal Credit \nare\n insufficiently robust\n and\n react to rent arrears rather than proactively prevent them\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nso called\n ‘b\nedroom \nt\nax’\n takes little account of the legitimate needs of disabled people and others for additional space\n. \nIn addition, d\nownsizing could\n in fact\n increase the \nhousing benefit\n bill, for example if affected households move into the\n more expensive\n private rented sect\nor\n. \n \n&#xa0;\n1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWorryingly, the discretionary, short-term and cash-limited nature of Discretionary Housing Payments means they are inadequate to support people who have been hit by the reforms outlined in this submission and have no alternative support.\n&#xa0;\n1.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe therefore\n make some practical recommendations to ensure these reforms work better, including:\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe DWP commit\ns\n to review affordability and up-rate LHA rates if necessary to ensure low income households can access accommodation\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe ‘b\nedroom \nt\nax’ should only apply \nwhen alternative smaller accommodation\n is unavailable\n,\n \nand certain groups should be exempt\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe 13 week protection rule must be replicated under Universal Credit\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSuccessive governments have moved to curb the rising cost of \nhousing benefit\n by adjusting benefit\n entitlement,\n but these efforts have focused on treating the symptoms rather than the cause.\n While this submission makes recommendations to mitigate against the worst effects of these welfare reforms, t\nhe Government must invest\n in \nbuil\nding new homes\n if it is serious about\n bring\ning\n down the housing benefit bill\n. This is the only long term way to reduce the cost of housing and lift\n households out of the benefit trap.\n2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLocal Housing Allowance Reforms &#xa0;\n2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLHA\n is a form of housing benefit paid to tenants in the private rented sector. Un\ntil April 2012, \nLHA\n rates were calculated on a monthly basis based on actual rents in a local market\n.\n \nBenefit levels would stay the same or even fall if rental markets remained \nsteady\n, but if rents started rising due to market pressure, LHA rates would increase to ensure that low income private renting households could\n \nfind affordable accommodation\n. \nThe Welfare Reform Act broke this fundamental link between support for private renters and actual rents by linking LHA rates to CPI inflation from April 2013. &#xa0;2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhis means LHA rates will fall behind the actual cost of private renting as private rents have traditionally risen faster than inflation (from 1997-2007 rents increased by \n70 \nper cent but CPI only rose by\n&#xa0;\n20 per cent\n). \nLinking CPI to LHA would make a third of local authorities unaffordable to low income households by 2023.&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Minister for \nWelfare Reform acknowledged that\n linking LHA to CPI \nrisks\n \ncreating a “critical lack of\n affordable housing”\n and said\n the Government was only committed to the measure until 2014-15\n, although the policy will automatically run on beyond the current spending review period\n. He pledged to reconsider LHA rates at this point if they \nwere \nout of ste\np with local rents\n, with the option to increase rates\n. \nThe Government must stick to this pledge. &#xa0;2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Welfare Up-rating Act 2013 implemented a further cut, making it more likely that rents will outpace LHA. \nLHA\n rates will\n \nbe up-rated by\n&#xa0;\na maximum of \none \nper cent\n \nin 2014-\n15 and 2015-\n16, even if rents or CPI are rising faster than this. \nThe least affordable areas will be exempt, but DWP has so far released insufficient evidence of how this will be calculated and distributed\n,\n nor have they addressed concerns about the impact in other areas.\n \nThe more LHA rates are held down, the greater the risk that low income households won’t be able to find affordable housing in the private rented sector. &#xa0;\n2.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis is exacerbated further by\n l\nan\ndlords\n’\n \naversi\non\n to hous\ning\n tenants on benefi\nts. Successive reductions in h\nousing \nb\nenefit \nhave\n made claimants more unattractive to \nlandlords\n.\n \nA Big L\nottery funded project by Shelter and Crisis\n \nshowed \nthat \nlandlords’ unwillingness to accept tenants on LHA is \na major barrier to access\n a private rented home\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn addition, separate \ne\nvidence from Shelter\n r\nevealed how poorly the \nLHA \nchanges have\n been communicated. \nClaimants \nwe spoke to\n we\nre \nextremely confused about what\n was changing and \nwhat it meant\n for them. We found a t\nendency\n for claimants\n to conflate different chan\nges or to confuse\n different\n timetable\ns.\n \nF\nor example, \nUniversal Credit \n(UC) \nand \nhousing benefit\n changes\n were referred to interchangeably\n. This \nweaken\ns\n support for U\nC and\n cause\ns\n unnecessary concern.\n The UC roll-out must seek to avoid replicating these communication errors. \n&#xa0;2.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRecommendations:-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe DWP should commit to a full review of affordability in the housing benefit sub-market and to up-rate LHA rates if necessary to ensure that low income households can access accommodation&#xa0;3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSocial Sector Size Criteria &#xa0;\n3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWith the \nintroduction\n of the \nsocial \nsector size\n \ncriteria\n (the so called ‘bedroom tax’)\n \nin April 2013, \n660,000 people living in council or housing association homes had their housing benefit reduced as they had one or more rooms judged to be “spare bedrooms”. Hard-pressed fami\nlies on the lowe\nst incomes\n now \nneed to find an average of £14 per week out of already stretched b\nudgets to cover the shortfall. \nSome will be unable to pay this shortfall and will \ncut back\n on essential spending on food and \nhousehold bills\n.\n \nO\nthers may\n \ntak\ne\n out debt, joining the one million households who used a pay day loan to cove\nr their housing costs last year, while \nmany\n may risk arrears, eviction and homelessness. This increases\n costs for local authorities and undermines social housing as the last truly\n affordable housing option for families on low incomes. \n&#xa0;3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf households cannot cover the difference there is not necessarily anywhere for them to move to, meaning they will be unable to escape the penalty. Because social landlords have tended to build homes to last families for many years, there is a lack of smaller one and two bed flats for households to downsize into. This is true nationally but \nis\n \na particular problem in certain areas.\n \nFor example, i\nn S\ncotland we know\n that\n of the 82,500 households affected by the social sector size criteria, 60,000 need to move to a 1 bedroom p\nroperty to avoid the pe\nnalty.\n \nC\nurrently around 20,000 \none\n bedroom properties are let annual\nly\n across the whole of Scotland in \nthe\n social sector\n. \nDownsizing could actually increase the housing benefit bill, for example if affected households move into more expensive alternatives such as the private rented sector, a higher cost social rent property (likely if transferring to newer accommodation or from council to housing association accommodation) or into an Affordable Rent (up to 80% market rent) property. &#xa0;3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHomeless households should not be penalised by the social sector size criteria.  H\nomeless households living in local authority owned temporary accommodation (TA) \nshould be \nexempt fro\nm the \nunder occupation\n penalty. \nThis is particularl\ny a problem in Scotland where 56\n% of \nTA\n is local authority owned rather than leased or \nlicensed\n from a\n \nsocial or private landlord\n where different subsidy rules apply. By definition, househ\nolds who are forced to stay in TA\n unt\nil a settled home is available \nare vulnerable and in stressful situation\ns\n and in particular need of a stable home to get back on their\n feet.\n&#xa0;3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe calculation of how many bedrooms a household needs is a crude assessment which takes little account of the legitimate needs of disabled people and others for additional space. Shelter has been approached by families who have good reasons for their ‘spare’ bedrooms, \nfor example where\n they need space to store essential medical equipment. Only very limited exemptions have been granted for disabled \nchildren\n and\n \nthe DWP continues t\no maintain that the over-stretched \nDHP\n fund is the best way to support disabled households.\n However,\n there is no guarantee that this will happen, and families have no right to appeal if DHP is not granted.\n&#xa0;\n3.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI\nn \nthe case of \nBurnip, Gorry and Trengrove\n the Court of Appeal ruled that \nhousing benefit\n regulations and not DHPs\n should cater for disabled children who cannot share a bedroom due to different caring needs. \nWhere \nthe \nDWP wish to support hard cases it would be more appropriate to do so via statuto\nry regulations, which provide guaranteed protection, rather than unpredictable DHPs. \n&#xa0;\n3.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEven if DHPs were an appropriate tool to protect hard cases, the additional money that has been made available is unlikely to be sufficient. For example there is no guar\nantee that the\n \nadditional £25 million in \nintended to support disabled people living in homes with expensive adaptations\n will be sufficient, and it is certain that many other disabled people will not be awarded a DHP\n. \nIn England it has been calculated that the DHP budget can only help one in every 15 of all households affected by the bedroom tax and in Scotland it is 1 in 17 (6 per cent), which means that a significant number of vulnerable people will not have access to a much-needed DHP payment.  \n&#xa0;3.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRecommendations:-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe penalty should only apply when alternative smaller accommodation is available and the tenant has not made an attempt to downsize -\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere should be an exemption in regulations for:-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDisabled people living in specially adapted homes -\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHouseholds in local authority temporary accommodation -\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThose with legitimate reasons for needing the extra space including: &#xa0;4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUniversal Credit – Alternative Payment Arrangements&#xa0;4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUniversal Credit (UC) will be paid as a ‘Standard Payment’ for the majority of claimants\n,\n meaning claimants will receive a direct monthly payment to the household, inclusive \nof \nhousing benefit\n.\n \nEveryday money management is difficult for those on low i\nncomes and with complex needs. So, h\naving to m\nanag\ne\n finances in this way \nmay therefore \nlead to\n arrears and ultimately eviction.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe DWP has announced \nwelcome \nsafeguards in the form of \nAlternative Payments Arrangements (APAs)\n where \nthe housing cost component of UC \nwill\n be paid direct to \nthe \nlandlord\n. \nThe APA proposals are welcome, but can be strengthened to ensure arrears are prevented in the first place.  &#xa0;4.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe goal for UC claimants in settled accommodation should be improving financial capability to move those who can to financial independence. Each \nclaimant should be assessed to \nidentify whether they should begin on \nS\ntandard \nP\nayments or an APA\n. The assessment \nshould \nconsider needs beyond money management and debt and cover financial literacy, access to appropriate financial products, and other circum\nstances such as drug and alcohol addiction and debts. The assessment should result in a\nn\n understanding of how long it might take the claimant to build financial capability and what support is required\n \nto make Standard Payments a realistic goal. \nHouseholds should have the option to self-refer for an assessment for APAs, at any time in their \nUC\n application.\n&#xa0;4.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nImportantly, APAs should be used to prevent arrears occurring in the first place. Claimants who need A\nPAs \nshould be identified \nup-front \nin collaboration with landlords, \nJob Centre Plus, local authorities\n and other\n agencies to prevent them \nmoving into arrears\n – the Local Delivery Partnerships charged with making \nUC\n work on the ground would be a natural lead for this\n.\n&#xa0;4.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAll homeless households in temporary accommodation (TA) should automatically receive APAs to ensure the housing component of UC is paid to the landlord until they move into settled accommodation. This \nwill ensure landlords receive rent and t\nhat people \nin TA\n,\n who in the\n vast majority of cases have already been found homeless\n,\n do not get evicted and become homeless again.  \n&#xa0;4.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRecommendations:-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAll claimants should be assessed for financial capability at the start of their claim, and APAs put in place for those who are not ready for Standard Payments -\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nClaimants who need APAs upfront must be a priority;  Local Delivery Partnerships could lead on this -\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHouseholds should have the option to self-refer for an assessment for APAs -\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHouseholds in TA should automatically receive APAs.&#xa0;&#xa0;\n5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUniversal Credit - 13 Week Protection&#xa0;5.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn a little discussed move, short-term protection against rent arrears for people who have recently lost their job will be abolished under UC. Currently if someone \nhas not claimed \nhousing benefit\n in the previous 52 weeks and could afford their rent when they signed up to a tenancy, \nthey can claim \nhousing benefit\n for their full rent for 13 weeks. Under the \nUC\n this will be removed. \n&#xa0;\n5.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHousing benefit is subject to a num\nber of regulations that limit the amount that can be paid out. This frequently means that people eligible for \nhousing benefit\n are not able to claim sufficient support to cover their actual rent.\n This is especially likely to affect private tenants as LHA ra\ntes are purposely set below “average” rents. \n&#xa0;\n5.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA comparison of median rents across Broad Rental Market Areas and LHA rates shows that a family renting a typical three bedroom home would have to make up more than £100 a month in over a quarter (27%) of loca\nl authority areas in England if the 13 week protection rule is abolished. In more than two in five (43%) of local authorities families will have a shortfall of more than £75 a month.\n&#xa0;\n5.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe 13 week protection rule\n is intended to give people sufficient time t\no find work and resume paying their rent independently or, if their circumstances are unlikely to improve, make a planned move into cheaper accommodation. \n&#xa0;\n5.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe majority of people \nwho lose their job \nwill only experience a short-term spell of unemployment. \nOf the 325,000 unemployment claims that came to an end in June 2013, 53% of claimants were in receipt of JSA for 13 weeks or less\n. Shelter’s concern is that without an adequate safety net, people will be unable to bounce back and will be anxious about how\n they will pay their housing costs at a time when they should be focused on getting bac\nk into work. For some, \ninadequate support will tip them into arrears, eviction and homelessness. \n&#xa0;5.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRecommendations:-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe 13 week protection rule must be replicated under UC, in a way that is compatible with a unified benefit system-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe DWP should publish an impact assessment of the loss of the 13 week protection rule. &#xa0;&#xa0;6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDiscretionary Housing Payments&#xa0;6.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nShelter is extremely concerned that Discretionary Housing Payments \n(DHPs) are being called upon inappropriately to support people with a predictable and clearly defined additional need, when statutory regulations would be better placed to avoid unintended consequences.\n&#xa0;\n6.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nConcerns with DHPs:They are discretionary - People cannot guarantee they will receive support, even if their circumstances are those that Ministers had in mind when releasing additional funding.  \nThey are short-term –\n \nAlthough guidance does state that indefinite awards can be made if a claimant’\ns circumstances are unlikely to change\n,\n local authorities are wary of doing this as it makes it harder to budget. Where a shortfall is ongoing and predictable people shouldn’t have to go through repeated applications.\nThey are cash-limited – The allocation\n of DHP given to local councils is cash limited and insufficient to respond to everyone with a shortfall. The need to make the budget last throughout the year can also encourage local authorities not to publicise DHPs or to reject applications earlier in t\nhe year in case of a surge in demand later. Local authorities can top-up the DWP allocation by 1.5 times but are legally prohibited from spending anything beyond this. Moreover, many are unable to do so because of pressures on their budgets.  \n&#xa0;\n6.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI\nn the firs\nt three months of 2013 th\nere was a sharp increase (of 60 per cent\n) in the number of DHP applications \nin local authorities in England from \n31,562\n (2011/12)\n to\n \n50,393\n (2012/13)\n. In 2011/12 the average number of DHP applications per local authority was 274, i\nt rose to 420 in 2012/13, and just in the first three months of 2013/14 an average of 294 DHP applications have been received per local authority. We therefore do not expect the historic trend of local authorities returning unspent DHP allocations to be re\npeated.\n&#xa0;\n6.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRecommendations-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe DWP should introduce regulations to provide statutory protection for those hardest hit by the housing benefit changes-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe DHP budget must be distributed proportionately and transparently (according to need) across all the local authorities in the UK to target the most vulnerable people most effectively.&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n26 September 2013&#xa0;\n6\n&#xa0;\n \n13 week protection ensures that if someone has not claimed housing benefit in the previous 52 weeks and could afford their rent when they signed up to a tenancy, they can claim housing benefit for their full rent for 13 weeks if they lose their job. \n&#xa0;\n \nHow will changes to Local Housing Allowance affect low-income tenants in private rented housing?\n (\nCambridge Centre for Housing and Planning Research, 2010)\n \nThe Impact of Welfare Reform Bill measures on affordability for low income private renting familie\ns \n(Shelter, 2011)\n \nHL Deb, 14 December 2011, c1324\n Smith, M.
