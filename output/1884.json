"&#xa0;\nWritten submission from the Committee on Standards in Public Life (LPG 54)Introduction\nBackground \n“In all cases where new methods of delivering public services are being created, commissioners and providers should give careful thought to the mechanisms necessary to maintain expected high standards of behaviour and promote the seven principles of public life.”\nEstablishing ethical expectations through the procurement process“Public servants designing and commissioning services should, in a consistent and proportionate way, address ethical issues throughout the procurement process. Contractors and others should acknowledge the particular responsibilities they bear when delivering public services, paid for by public money, to individuals who might not have the choice to go elsewhere.” \n“In our view leaders and chief executives of all organisations delivering public services should take personal responsibility for ethical standards in their organisations and certify annually that they have satisfied themselves about the adequacy of their organisation’s arrangements for safeguarding high standards.”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n              \n              \n \nStandards matter: A review of best practice in promoting good behaviour in public life\n CM 8519, January 2013\n"
