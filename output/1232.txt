&#xa0;Written evidence from Ashfield District Council/ Nottinghamshire County Council(SLC 0001)&#xa0;I represent a township in Nottinghamshire called Hucknall (former MP Paddy Tipping) and back in 2008, a grandmother and her grandson were killed (hit by a train) on a pedestrian crossing known as either Bayles and Wyhles or Moorbridge.&#xa0;Last year, another tragic death occurred, this time involving a 13 year girl who was hit by a tram (NET).&#xa0;There have been a total of 5 deaths at this crossing, along with 2 horse related incidents, and numerous "near misses" The 2 human deaths are believed to be suicide.&#xa0;I have held several public meetings, and met with different Network Rail chiefs to try my best to get things resolved, and only now - after the third death have Network Rail decided to build and fund a footbridge over this crossing.&#xa0;Members of our community, have found this difficult to accept, if it was known that this busy pedestrian crossing was a potential source of yet another accident, why then, after the 2 deaths in 2008 was a footbridge not erected then?&#xa0;Nobody knows the criteria which Network Rail are working to, and it appears that everything is funding orientated, yet Network Rail are quite prepared to pay the fines imposed by the courts for errors of their judgement. Leeds £450,000 and £1 million at Elsenham. Would it not have made more common sense to have executed the safety works - and saved lives, rather than pay the fines and they still have to do the safety works after.&#xa0;I welcome, and would be honoured with the opportunity to address your Select Committee to explain the tragic events which have occurred in Hucknall over the past 5 years, as unfortunately I've been involved in them all, and perhaps I will be able to give your committee the community concerns and facts.&#xa0;Many believe that the recommendations from the Transport Select Committee need to reflect a clear criteria, which Network Rail must keep to, with the emphasis on protecting lives.&#xa0;Should you need any further information, please do not hesitate in contacting me.&#xa0;July 2013&#xa0;
