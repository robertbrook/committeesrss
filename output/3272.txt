[[[Introduction]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1              We are grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the Committee’s inquiry               into the Strategic Road Network. &#xa0;1.2              We welcome the publication of the Action for Roads Command Paper as it provides clarity on the way in which the national strategic road network, integral to London’s own growth and development plans, will be developed.&#xa0;1.3              While the Mayor is responsible for the major roads in London (amounting to five per cent of the network), through the Transport for London Road Network (TLRN), with more local roads being the responsibility of the London boroughs, this strategy matters to London in the following ways:motorway network in the vicinity of London will affect London's roads, which are already among the busiest and most congested in the country.&#xa0;1.4      Through the Mayor’s Roads Task Force (RTF), London has developed an               ambitious vision and direction for all its roads, with three aims:&#xa0;2.

[[[also improving the environment? ]]]&#xa0;2.1                We welcome the Department for Transport’s (DfT’s) vision for Britain’s roads               and agree that a well-functioning road network and a well-protected               environment are not mutually exclusive. The new structure and committed               funding for the Highways Agency (HA) outlined in the report should enable               better collaboration between the HA and other strategic agencies such as               Transport for London, as the quality of the national road network impacts on               the London network. &#xa0;2.2               However, we recommend that the report should more strongly emphasise the varied uses of roads and the differing demands placed upon the roads by their users. For London, the RTF identified six functions of roads and streets – to enable movement, to provide space for ‘living’, to unlock development potential, to enable deliveries and other kerbside activity, to contribute to safety, and to contribute to an improved environment. Although ‘movement’ is key, many of these other functions would be relevant to the national strategic road network.&#xa0;2.3              Furthermore, the RTF recommended that both the ‘movement’ and the ‘place’ function of roads and streets should inform the way they are managed and developed. It proposed a framework, which we have adopted, consisting of nine street types representing those with low to strategic importance for ‘movement’ and for ‘place’. The RTF then set out priorities and minimum service standards for other users for each of the nine street types.&#xa0;2.4              A toolkit of appropriate interventions was then set out for each street type. For roads in London with strategic importance for ‘movement’ and local ‘place’ importance (ie the most relevant to the national strategic road network), the RTF proposed the following approach to ‘movement’ and ‘place’:&#xa0;

[[[Tools]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;2.5              Despite a strong emphasis on improving ‘place’, the RTF recommended that the road network still needed to fulfil its movement function - that the road network as a whole must continue to operate reliably and offer reasonable journeys times for essential users.&#xa0;2.6              To achieve this it proposed that measures to mitigate against any increase in congestion – through either or both of demand management and the provision of alternative space – would be essential and should be investigated. &#xa0;2.7              The resulting approach can be summarised, therefore, as to apply specific measures to each section of road to ensure it meets the needs of its users according to its street-type, and to also apply strategic measures to ensure the road network as a whole continues to fulfil its movement role.&#xa0;2.8              We consider that this approach is most likely to ensure the needs of all users (and the environment) is likely to be met.  We are currently applying the street-type approach to the TLRN (as well as working with willing boroughs to apply it to their roads) and exploring innovative ways in which to manage demand and to provide alternative/replacement space for vehicles to mitigate congestion impacts.&#xa0;2.9              We are happy to discuss the application of the RTF approach with the DfT and HA further in relation to the development and implementation of their ambitious plans for England’s roads to best meet the needs of all road users and improve the environment.&#xa0;3.

[[[ modes?]]]&#xa0;3.1              ‘Action for Roads’ makes the point that the Government is investing significantly in all forms of transport in England, especially in the rail network. It says, given the extent of population growth and in the movement of freight, that not all journeys can be removed from the road network and that the nature of many journeys means that other modes cannot always offer an alternative to car travel on the strategic road network.&#xa0;3.2              However, the extent of the Government’s joined-up approach is not described in detail within ‘Action for Roads’ but is briefly outlined in the DfT’s subsequent document ‘Transport – an engine for growth’, published August 2013. We welcome this further document which calls for ‘thinking of our transport network as a connected whole, not a series of separate systems’. &#xa0;3.3              This position is consistent with the Mayor’s Transport Strategy which sets out a balanced approach across modes to supporting economic growth and development, improving quality of life and achieving other goals in London. It is also consistent with the view of the RTF. This is not a question of competition between road and public transport.&#xa0;3.4    We therefore welcome the Government’s intention, described in ‘Transport an           engine for growth’ to make clear five year funding provisions for the Highways Agency, Transport for London, HS2, local highways maintenance, local major schemes (outside London) and integrated transport. This better aligns with the current rail investment planning and delivery process. We believe that this more co-ordinated approach between road, rail and London investment strategies is essential to meet the needs of all users.&#xa0;3.5              Investment both in the strategic road and rail networks, and in London’s strategic transport networks must continue to recognise London’s context of population and economic growth.  This will be critical in delivering the full potential of London’s growth areas and the economic potential in all parts of the city. The road networks alone, whether strategic or local, will not be able to fully accommodate this growth, which is projected to see London’s population grow to 10 million, and employment grow to 5.6 million people by 2031.&#xa0;3.6              In this respect we welcome the intention of a future Roads Investment Strategy being part of a wider integrated approach to investment in all modes of transport. We strongly encourage Government to ensure that investment decisions on roads and rail occur in an aligned and timely manner that focuses on addressing key problems both on the road and rail networks, whilst ensuring that this investment supports wider spatial, economic, social and environmental objectives.&#xa0;3.7              We welcome the reference in ‘Action for Roads’ to the strategic road network’s linkages to local networks, and in London’s case this would apply particularly where HA motorways interface with London’s own road networks which are critical points.  We also welcome the acknowledgement that walking and cycling investments, which enable more sustainable ways of travel on the road network, also form part of the plans for the strategic road network.&#xa0;3.8               However, we consider that demand management will also be required to meet our strategic goals. The RTF has highlighted various aspects for us to explore, including re-timing and ‘remoding’ freight and servicing, smarter charging, smart work centres and practices, next generation travel demand management schemes, active network management, parking policy and land use planning. We would like to see greater recognition of these tools in the development of the strategic Roads Investment Strategy in so far as they apply to this network.&#xa0;3.9              The commitment in ‘Action for Roads’ to greater funding certainty and flexibility for the strategic road network through the establishment of a Roads Investment Strategy is to be welcomed.  However, such an investment strategy cannot operate in isolation from planning mechanisms and funding streams for other transport modes, in particular those for the national rail network, and the Mayor’s transport networks in London. In addition, the establishment of Road Investment Strategies must not be to the detriment of either the scope of, or investment levels for, the national Rail Investment Strategy or for the heavily-used transport networks within London.  Only through the proper resourcing of all elements of our strategic transport networks can the demand for travel in and around London be met in the most economically, environmentally and financially sustainable way.  &#xa0;4.

[[[              ]]]

[[[uncertainty in its forecast?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.1    Growth forecasts for demand on the strategic network are important for us as          they will impact on the level of traffic on London’s roads. The way in which the          Government deals with uncertainty is also important to us, as it will determine          how we interpret them alongside our own forecasts. In its reporting of the          current forecasts, the DfT takes account of uncertainty in population          forecasting, growth in GDP and the price of oil by setting out a range of future          out-turns in terms of traffic growth. Government defines a central case although          this is not presented as the most likely scenario or the best scenario for          planning. The DfT says it will continue to review how it should represent          uncertainty in the forecasts.  We support this approach.              4.2    The DfT (on page 1 of Road Transport Forecasts 2013) makes clear          that the Government forecasts for the growth in demand for the strategic road            network in England should not be viewed as what it thinks will happen but            should be treated as what may happen based on:&#xa0;4.3    There are areas of further uncertainty. The DfT acknowledges (on page 7, Box             2 of its document Road Transport Forecasts 2013) that its forecasts are            designed to project national traffic levels and not regional or local traffic levels.           The DfT also accepts that it needs to revisit its London forecast, particularly in          relation to several key factors which are not yet taken into account in producing          the traffic forecasts. These are:&#xa0;4.4                   The above factors would add considerable complexity to forecasting the                            growth in demand for the strategic road network.  However, we support the                         DfT’s view that Government forecasts should address these issues in order                         to improve the forecasts.&#xa0;4.5              We recognise the challenges of forecasting and, especially in the context of substantial projected population growth in the UK and London, believe this is a challenge well worth addressing.  We welcome the recognition by DfT of the need to strengthen some aspects of its road traffic forecasting, especially for regional and local areas and we are willing to work with the Department to assist in this task, especially on sharing our current analysis on the drivers of demand.&#xa0;5.

[[[              ]]]

[[[strategic road network? What impact will new technology have? ]]]&#xa0;5.1              Our work with the RTF concluded that a broad set of measures is required to achieve all the desired outcomes for London’s roads and streets over the next twenty or so years, including the efficient and reliable movement on the strategic road network in London. These are•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Ensuring infrastructure and assets are fit for the future•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; More efficient / flexible use of space•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Intelligent systems and management•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Changing behaviour / managing demand•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Substitute/relocated/enhanced capacity&#xa0;5.2               All five of these will be required to improve reliability and efficiency of London’s strategic road network, as described in our response to Question 1, and could be considered for the national strategic road network.&#xa0;5.3              Investing in new technology will enable us to significantly improve our capability to manage flows on London’s strategic roads more effectively. This will enable us to better respond to planned events and incidents as they occur, and to help mitigate the impact on congestion of higher levels of cycling and ‘place’ improvements. The vision outlined in Action for Roads, of technology playing an ever-increasing role in improving traffic management and safety on the UK’s strategic road network, is one we therefore share in relation to London’s strategic road network. &#xa0;5.4               We are currently extending SCOOT to a further 1500 sites. SCOOT can increase the effective capacity of a junction by about 12 per cent. We are also developing an ‘active network management’ capability which will enable us to manage the volume of flows across the network and could be used, for example, to protect critical parts of the strategic road network from becoming overly congested. We are also developing new technology including ‘co-operative systems’ which would enable better real time management of the network, responding almost instantly to incidents on the network, for example. &#xa0;5.5              While this technology creates the essential foundation for the reliable and efficient operation of the strategic network, it alone would be insufficient to cater for longer term growth in London. It is probable that this is also the case for the national strategic road network.&#xa0;5.6              We are therefore investigating the case for further demand management measures to reduce pressure on the network as well as the case for providing substitute, relocated or enhanced road space. Analysis conducted for the RTF concluded that the application of both demand management and increased road space measures would be most effective at supporting long term growth.&#xa0;5.7              In particular, we are looking at the extent to which out-of-hours deliveries could be encouraged and the extent to which this could relieve congestion. Other measures being explored include targeted behaviour change initiatives, ‘car lite’ development in growth areas, and spatially targeted initiatives in inner and outer London such as ‘Green zones’, car clubs, DIY streets and measures to complement cycling investment. All these measures are likely to be relevant to the national strategic road network.&#xa0;5.8              We are investigating measures to provide additional space. These range from junction improvements, fly-unders, mini-tunnels through to longer cross-city and orbital tunnels as means to better cater for essential strategic movement whilst mitigating the impact it can have on local communities. Again, we suggest that such measures could be considered, where appropriate, for the national strategic road network to ensure reliable and efficient movement in the longer term.&#xa0;6.

[[[ roads and attract new investors? Are there good examples ]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[from other countries that could be applied in the UK? ]]]&#xa0;6.1      There are several mechanisms by which the Government could increase investment in strategic roads, which would benefit the London’s roads by improving traffic flow and relieving congestion. These mechanisms include investing more in pension funds and providing stability for revenue streams. The proposed new structure for the HA, the Roads Investment Strategy and greater certainty on the funding for HA outlined in Action for Roads should help to deliver a long-term plan for the road network and attract investment from the private sector.&#xa0;6.2                   In terms of increasing investment in strategic roads, there should be greater                         focus on encouraging investment from pension funds, sovereign wealth funds                         and similar. Pension funds are able to provide funding on a large scale and                         are (in the current market) relatively cheaper than bank funding and but more                         importantly they can support the project through the whole investment cycle.                                  A key factor to securing this is to structure the opportunity as a low risk, low                         volatility investment with long-term revenue streams.  Bond financing should                           also be considered as another suitable source for funding and maintaining the                        strategic road network wholly or in conjunction with the pension funds (and               the like).&#xa0;6.3                  Private investors will also be seeking a separate and clearly defined revenue                         stream to cover payments and certainty around future investment to gain the                        confidence needed to plan ahead and invest.&#xa0;6.4               The proposed five-year funding settlement for the HA will help in providing some stability around revenue streams. The HA will benefit from having a fixed proportion of the current taxes paid by motorists (Vehicle Excise Duty and fuel duty) allocated to it, as this will establish an independent revenue stream, and attract private investment.&#xa0;6.5                Nonetheless with the growing deficit and reducing taxes paid by motorist due               to vehicle efficiencies, the HA may still require a separate revenue stream in               some form of a user charge to be able to deliver the new capacity and attract               the long-term private investment.&#xa0;6.6                 ‘Standard tolling’ or ‘user charging’ can in some cases be seen as too                       rudimentary and may be more suitable for a new crossing with no alternatives.                        It may not be the most appropriate way to fund a network of strategic roads                          requiring different level of upgrade and investment. An alternative approach,                         such as setting up an ‘access charge’ to use the strategic road network could                           be like buying a season ticket and may have a reduced impact on changing               the user behaviour. The use of differential charges that cater for both ‘heavy               users’ and ‘light users’ may also be worth considering.&#xa0;6.7                 Another alternative could be a ‘user fee’ based on mileage travelled on the                           strategic road network. Under this model those who use it the most and               benefit from the infrastructure pay the most.  This approach is possibly more               transparent than an access charge in that is reflects the cost of each journey                       and is therefore more likely to have a more direct impact on behaviour               change.&#xa0;6.8                 This approach has been adopted by other countries around the world. As                          examples, a similar system is in operation in New Zealand for some vehicle                       types, while Oregon’s Department for Transport have recently completed pilot                       studies for a similar system and are proposing to introduce it by 2015. &#xa0;6.9              The RTF recommended that we explore the potential for developer contributions to contribute towards funding for road improvements. This source may also be applicable to the national strategic road network.&#xa0;October 2013                                                 7 Split Cycle Offset Optimisation Technique.  This is a dynamic traffic control system which responds reactively to traffic flow approaching a junction on a second-by-second basis and adapts signal timings for each arm of the junction accordingly.
