&#xa0;Written evidence from Amanda Carter (CYS 062)&#xa0;I would like to put this question to the Committee: why is it that HGVs and LGVs, that are designed for motorway use, are allowed to travel in any city street at any time, when they have been proved to have serious blind spots: are a serious danger to children, pedestrians, cyclists. Lunacy! This is putting people's safety last.I submit that only vehicles that pass stringent safety checks and which are an appropriate size for narrow and congested city roads, and which do not pose a danger when sharing the road with cyclists and pedestrians including children, should be allowed into towns and cities. &#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
