defaultThe funding model for the BBC should be reviewed to make it fairer and allow the BBC to focus.
defaultW
defaultith the huge selection of channels available
default these days I feel that I cannot see any justification in forcing UK households to pay for any programme types 
defaultexcept those seen as a strictly public service focus and to give independent TV a chance to grow in the UK.
defaultPublic Service in my view would be very focused 
defaultI.E: OU, Children’s Programmes, News reporting rather than extended current affairs. 
defaultThese programm
defaultes would be better in my view funded by general taxation 
defaultwith 
defaultall other television funded by optional subscription which was not on option prior to digital television.
defaultMy motivation for writing in.
defaultI live in Switzerland with my wife, we pay the Swiss TV li
defaultcence and also subscribe to a Pay TV package which includes UK TV channels.
defaultAs our parents are in their late 70’s we keep a small flat near them in order to be able one of us to fly over and look after them at short notice if required. Typically we current
defaultly only live in it a few days a year. 
defaultAs we have a TV in the house I have to buy a UK TV Licence even to watch a few days TV which seems absurdly unfair when I am already paying for it over here. 
defaultA further point is that via the internet or cable I can ac
defaultcess hundreds of TV channels wherever I am in the world via my Swiss provider &amp; the internet legally- unless I do so in the UK?
defaultI feel that the BBC has grown into a monster we don’t need to afford any more and we would probably be more creative as a nation
default without it.
