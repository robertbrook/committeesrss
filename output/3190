[normal]The funding model for the BBC should be reviewed to make it fairer and allow the BBC to focus.
[normal]W
[normal]ith the huge selection of channels available
[normal] these days I feel that I cannot see any justification in forcing UK households to pay for any programme types 
[normal]except those seen as a strictly public service focus and to give independent TV a chance to grow in the UK.
[normal]Public Service in my view would be very focused 
[normal]I.E: OU, Children’s Programmes, News reporting rather than extended current affairs. 
[normal]These programm
[normal]es would be better in my view funded by general taxation 
[normal]with 
[normal]all other television funded by optional subscription which was not on option prior to digital television.
[normal]My motivation for writing in.
[normal]I live in Switzerland with my wife, we pay the Swiss TV li
[normal]cence and also subscribe to a Pay TV package which includes UK TV channels.
[normal]As our parents are in their late 70’s we keep a small flat near them in order to be able one of us to fly over and look after them at short notice if required. Typically we current
[normal]ly only live in it a few days a year. 
[normal]As we have a TV in the house I have to buy a UK TV Licence even to watch a few days TV which seems absurdly unfair when I am already paying for it over here. 
[normal]A further point is that via the internet or cable I can ac
[normal]cess hundreds of TV channels wherever I am in the world via my Swiss provider &amp; the internet legally- unless I do so in the UK?
[normal]I feel that the BBC has grown into a monster we don’t need to afford any more and we would probably be more creative as a nation
[normal] without it.
