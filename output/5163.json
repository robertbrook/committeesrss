"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from National Asian Business Association [TOB29]&#xa0;\n1.0 \nThis submission is on behalf of the NABA, an umbrella body representing the following\nBritish Asian business organisations:\n&#xa0;\nLABA \n– Leicestershire Asian Business Association\nABDN\n- Asian Business Development Network (Yorkshire)\nIAB \n– Institute of Asian Businesses – Birmingham\nHABA\n- Hertfordshire Asian Business Association\nBABA \n– Bedfordshire Asian Business Association\nBACBA\n- Black Country Asian Business Association – Dudley\nNeABA\n- Newcastle Asian Business Association\nABA \n– Asian Business Association – London\nYABA \n– Yorkshire Asian Business Association (Leeds)\n&#xa0;\n2.0 NABA and Declaration of Interests&#xa0;\n2.1 NABA has nine constituent organisations across the UK with a total membership of around 50,000, of which approximately 10,000 are tobacco retailers. NABA’s membership includes both retailers who sell tobacco, wholesalers and manufactures.\n&#xa0;\n2.2 However, NABAs policy positions and the information contained within this submission are our own and\n we stand as guarantor of that. We work alongside a wide range of organisations in order to protect and enhance the interests of the 50,000 members whom we represent but we maintain our independence at all times.\n&#xa0;\n2.3 Specifically NABA aims:\n\n\nTo continual\nly monitor the needs of its members and the broader business community and effectively respond to the changing needs of its members which the business environment generates;\n\n\nTo effectively represent its members at all levels within the business community\n by actively driving forward relevant business issues and seeking clarification of issues which may, do or will affect its members;\n\n\nTo actively seek partnerships with other organisations which can assist in the attainment of NABAs mission;\n\n\nTo communica\nte and inform members of issues and initiatives which can assist in the\nbetter management of their operations;\n\n\nTo facilitate opportunities where effective networking can occur for its members, and\n\n\nTo engage, lobby and influence policy and strategy roll\n-out with each of the three\npolitical parties in the UK\n&#xa0;3.0 Context&#xa0;\n3.1 There are 33,000 small newsagents and retailers across Britain working, on average, 16\nhours a day to service their communities. Between them they serve over 5 million customers a day.\n&#xa0;\n3.2 Smoking is harmful and should not be encouraged but tobacco is a legal product that accounts for approximately 22% of annual turnover for retailers. This figure can be as high as 40% for some retail stores, with much evidence to suggest that many non-tobacco sales are in fact additional purchases made by adult smokers coming in store to buy tobacco.\n&#xa0;\n4.0 Concerns&#xa0;\n4.1 The illicit trade in tobacco products has, in the experience of our members, grown significantly in recent years. Any type of illicit trade, whether counterfeit or contraband, deprives responsible retailers of much needed revenue and only benefits criminal gangs who are less scrupulous as to who they sell cigarettes to. The illicit trade in tobacco also deprives the Government of much needed revenues with HMRC estimating the loss to be nearly £2billion.\n&#xa0;\n4.2 At the same time as our members have seen the illicit market growing, law enforcement agencies and local authorities have experienced cuts to their budgets. In our view, this has led to an ‘enforcement-gap’ on the ground. Combine this with the lack of coordination and cooperation between HMRC, Trading Standards and local police forces, we have seen the effectiveness of law enforcement and local authorities significantly diminish in recent years.\n&#xa0;\n4.3 As an organisation we would like to see this addressed as a priority for Government and we welcome the conclusion of the recent Public Accounts Committee report which makes clear that more must be done by the law enforcement agencies to provide a co-ordinated approach to tackling the flow of illicit tobacco within our borders.\n&#xa0;\n4.4 However, the experience of our members is that a large amount of the volume of illicit tobacco coming into the UK is cigarettes known as ‘illicit whites’. As we understand it, these products are being manufactured legally in other countries purely to be smuggled into the UK and other countries. We would urge the government to see if anything can be done to stem this flow to protect small retailers and also their own revenues.\n&#xa0;\n5.0 Potential Impact of Plain Packaging in Ireland&#xa0;\n5.1 NABA does not have the expertise to provide a comprehensive view on the impact on the UK of plain packaging in Ireland. However, we believe the views we submitted as part of the UK consultation on plain packaging are equally applicable in this instance; or indeed to the prospect of plain packaging in Scotland.\n&#xa0;\n5.2 It is clear that the impact of any prohibitive legislation at the UK border will have an impact on the quantity and availability of illicit tobacco within our borders. The natural effect of plain packaging is to make cigarettes easier to counterfeit. The consequent growth in the illicit trade and the likely increase in smuggled branded cigarettes will place extra pressure on HMRC officers at the Irish border and ports and airports serving Ireland at a time when resources – as set out above – are stretched.\n&#xa0;\n6.0 Current sanctions and penalties&#xa0;\n6.1 Combined with the lack of sufficient enforcement, our members have also frustration at the apparent lack of adequate penalties and sanctions. All too often the threat to the retailer comes from organised criminal gangs in their areas. The profits available to be made and the \nlack of adequate penalties means these gangs can thrive with perceived little risk.\n&#xa0;\n6.2 We understand that Trading Standards have recommended that the Sentencing  Guidelines issued to the courts be reviewed.\n NABA would support their call.\n&#xa0;\n7.0 Request for further information&#xa0;\n7.1 As Chair of NABA I would be willing to appear before the committee to expand upon my\nEvidence.\n&#xa0;\nNational Asian Business Association\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nMeasuring tax gaps’ 2012 at pages 20-21 available at http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/statistics/tax-gaps/mtg-2012.pdf\n \nAll Party Parliamentary Group on Smoking and Health Inquiry into the Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products, Memorandum from: Trading Standards Institute Tobacco Focus Group, November 2012 available at http://www.ash.org.uk/files/documents/ASH_888.pdf\n"
