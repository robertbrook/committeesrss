[normal]Written evidence submitted by the University of Cambridge (WSC034)[bold]Section 1: Why do numbers of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There are many scholarly articles which address the issue of retention of women in scientific 
[normal]Academia
[normal],
[normal],
[normal] and further details can be found in these references. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A summary of 
[normal]the most commonly cite
[normal]d
[normal] reasons include:
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Culture
[normal]Impact of caring responsibilities
[normal]Career development
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Section 2: When women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? What are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their 
[normal]skills in different employment sectors?
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Vitae
[normal], the national career development organisation for researchers, have
[normal] published a series of reports on ‘What do Researcher
[normal]s
[normal] do?’
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]based on LDL
[normal]H
[normal]E 
[normal](Longitudinal Destinations of Leavers in Higher Education) 
[normal]cohorts, as well as labour market information for doctoral researchers
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]but a
[normal] longer follow on
[normal] for LDL
[normal]H
[normal]E 
[normal] (&gt;3 years post PhD), 
[normal]larger cohorts
[normal] 
[normal]and additional case studies would be useful.
[normal]Systematic recording and monitoring 
[normal]of career destinations (particula
[normal]rly of 
[normal]PhD students and 
[normal]postdoctoral researchers) is being implemented by 
[normal]some
[normal] departments in Cambridge as part of Athena SWAN submissions.
[normal] This could be co-ordinated at a national level to permit more in-depth statistical analyses and identification of trends.
[normal]The investment in women’s training may be lost if routes are not found to enable them to re-enter the workforce after career breaks. 
[normal]Many take jobs which do not use their skills because this is all they can find.
[normal]The University is currently investigating the use of exit interviews/surveys to capture important information on reasons for leaving as well as destination data, particularly f
[normal]or research staff.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Section 3: 
[normal]What should univer
[normal]sities and the higher education s
[normal]ector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice?
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Universities must recognise that d
[normal]ifferent actions 
[normal]may be 
[normal]needed 
[normal]to address the specific issues identified at different career stages.  Many of the challenges highlighted in 
[normal]S
[normal]ection 1 
[normal]of this document 
[normal]are
[normal] addressed 
[normal]within universities 
[normal]under 
[normal]5
[normal] main themes
[normal] below
[normal].
[normal] Examples of initiatives 
[normal]underway 
[normal]at the University o
[normal]f Cambridge are 
[normal]reported
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Family considerations
[normal], particularly caring for young children, can often coincide with a critical stage for academic career development and is a key challenge for women as primary carers.  A lack of flexible working provision, long hours culture and difficulty in achieving a b
[normal]alance between home/family and working lives can lead to many women leaving academic altogether.  
[normal]The 
[normal]University of Cambridge
[normal] has 
[normal]introduced 
[normal]a number of measures
[normal] to support staff,
[normal] 
[normal]particularly women, 
[normal]including:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Institutions must ensure that women receive equal and respectful treatment in the workplace, particularly in disciplines where there is a majority of men and/or a culture that disadvantages women
[normal].
[normal]The University of Cambridge 
[normal]is implementing 
[normal]a numb
[normal]er of measures
[normal] to reflect an inclusive and gender aware culture,
[normal] including:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The provision of visible role models and development opportunities for women
[normal] can help promote careers in academia.
[normal]The University of Cambridge has 
[normal]adopted 
[normal]a number of measures
[normal] to enable the personal and professional development of women 
[normal]staff, including
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In order to achieve gender equality to is important to engage both men and women in the agenda, so that challenges are not seen as women’s issues and can be 
[normal]addressed by both sexes.
[normal]The University of Cambridge delivers 
[normal]annually 
[normal]a 
[normal]wide ranging 
[normal]series of 
[normal]engagement 
[normal]workshops and seminars around relevant topics
[normal];
[normal] for example 
[normal]the myth of 
[normal]meritocracy and unconscious bias
[normal],
[normal] targeted at different groups of staff as well as mixed audiences
[normal]It is vital that institutions and individuals address sectoral
[normal] and professional responsibilities in promoting science beyond their local environment.
[normal]The University of Cambridge 
[normal]contributes
[normal] to this important aspect of promoting women in the sciences
[normal] in a number of ways
