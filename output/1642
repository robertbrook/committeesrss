default This could be co-ordinated at a national level to permit more in-depth statistical analyses and identification of trends.
defaultThe investment in women’s training may be lost if routes are not found to enable them to re-enter the workforce after career breaks. 
defaultMany take jobs which do not use their skills because this is all they can find.
defaultThe University is currently investigating the use of exit interviews/surveys to capture important information on reasons for leaving as well as destination data, particularly f

defaultFamily considerations
default, particularly caring for young children, can often coincide with a critical stage for academic career development and is a key challenge for women as primary carers.  A lack of flexible working provision, long hours culture and difficulty in achieving a b
defaultalance between home/family and working lives can lead to many women leaving academic altogether.
