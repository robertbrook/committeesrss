These include among others: the disability-disaggregation of critical socio-economic data; the application of accessibility standards to the physical environment, transportation, information and communication infrastructure; and the realization of the principle of meaningful involvement of persons with disabilities - “Nothing about us without us”.The United Nations Partnership on the Rights of Persons with DisabilitiesOverview\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nProgramme profile \n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnabling legislation and policy frameworks\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEmpowering cultural norms\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCapable and inclusive institutions\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAccess to services (mainstream and targeted)\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAccess to justice\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nApplication of accessibility standards to products, environments and processes\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAccess to rehabilitation and habilitation including assistive technologies\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAdequate data and evidence\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA “One -UN” approach to disability - The UNPRPD responds to the complexity of disability by integrating the different competencies of various UN agencies into a common p\nrogrammatic platform.\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFocus on partnership-building - The UNPRPD leverages the unique position of the UN at country level to facilitate partnerships between governments, organizations of persons with disabilities and broader civil society.\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFocus on joint knowledge creation - The UNPRPD works to generate cutting-edge knowledge on good practices \nin the promotion of disability rights \nand ways to mainstream disability in the UN system operational activities.\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA catalytic approach - The UNPRPD utilizes its Fun\nd strategically to develop the capacities of partner countries to mobilize national and international resources for the promotion of disability rights.\nWork and results to date\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDevelopment of the UNPRPD Strategic and Operational Framework. The UNPRPD Strategic and Oper\national Framework, which outlines the UNPRPD overall objectives, strategic priorities and operating modalities was finalized in April 2012 following a broad consultative process that included the organization of a Partners’ Meeting in March 2012, with part\nicipation of all the UNPRPD constituencies.\n &#xa0;-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDevelopment of the UNPRPD Quality Assurance Framework.  A Quality Assurance Framework was developed in December 2012 to clearly identify the quality control mechanisms that would ensure the efficient and effect\nive implementation of projects as well as the monitoring and evaluation strategies to be adopted in order to maximize the learning potential of the UNPRPD’s work. \n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLaunch of the first UNPRPD Funding Round. A call for proposals launched in May 2012 led to \nthe identification of eleven joint UN programmes benefiting a total of 14 countries in multiple areas of CRPD implementation. The projects identified for funding under the first UNPRPD Funding Round were selected from among 35 proposals received from UN Co\nuntry Teams across all regions. These UN Country Teams were invited to submit proposals after a call for expressions of interest issued in February 2012, under which more than 60 applications were received.\n The countries and territories that were support u\nnder the first UNPRPD funding round are: Costa Rica, Indonesia, Moldova, Mozambique, Palestine, Pacific Islands (\nCook Islands, Fiji, Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea\n), South Africa, Togo, Tunisia, Viet Nam and Ukraine.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn \nMoldova, OHCHR, UNDP, UNICEF and WHO are working closely with the National Governmental Body on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to promote the full \ninclusion in society of persons with intellectual and mental disabilities. As a result of this project, significant advances have been made in establishing justice oversight over previously closed institutions and there is much greater awareness, in Moldov\nan psychiatry, about CRPD provisions. At the same time, policy dialogue has advanced significantly on issues such as legal capacity reform, adult deinstitutionalization and the formal establishment, under the state budget, of an Ombudsperson for Psychiatry\n. Commenting the work of the Pilot Ombudsperson for Psychiatry, currently supported by the project, UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Magdalena Sepulveda, stated: “I was favorably impressed with the pilot Ombudsperson for Psychiatr\ny arrangement, as well as with the positive changes and human rights scrutiny provided by the arrangement. I urge the Government to swiftly formalize and fully institutionalize the position of Ombudsperson for Psychiatry.”\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn \nCosta Rica, ILO and UNDP are collaborating with the Ministry of Labour and social partners to promote the right to work of persons with disabilities. With support from this project, the Costa Rican National Business Association has established a Network of Inclusive\n Enterprises, which can already count on a membership of 37 businesses with a total workforce of more than 15,000 employees across Costa Rica. In collaboration with key public sector institutions and civil society organizations, the members of the Network \nare working to create job opportunities for persons with disabilities and will take steps to make their business processes more inclusive and accessible. \n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn \nIndonesia, ILO and WHO, together with UNESCO and UNFPA, are implementing a project aimed at stren\ngthening the capacity of the national institutions in charge of coordinating the implementation of the CRPD. This initiative supported nationwide high-level policy dialogues with Mayors and the creation of a Network of Inclusive Cities which will facilitat\ne the exchange of knowledge and resources on the inclusion of persons with disabilities. Memoranda of Understanding have already been signed with the governments of Banda Aceh City and Yogyakarta City and six more will be signed over the next months. A fra\nmework for identifying key criteria in the process of building inclusive cities for persons with disabilities has been drafted with support from the project. The framework has been tested and applied in 4 cities resulting in the drafting of strategic plans\n and budgets addressing social inclusion of people living with disabilities. This work will provide the basis for a yearly appraisal of Indonesia’s cities that is expected to eventually include a disability inclusion award. \n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn \nTogo, OHCHR, UNICEF and WHO\n have been implementing a joint programme on inclusive education in the Savanes and Kara regions. Under this programme, Braille and sign language manuals were developed and tested together with a training manual on inclusive education endorsed by the Minis\ntry of Education in 2012 and used to train a total of 244 teachers and administrators to date. As a result of the support provided by the project, 539 children living with a disability out of the 640 identified in Kara and Savanes took their exams and 388 \nwere successful (71 percent).\nIntergovernmental mandates relevant to the UNPRPD\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHuman Rights Council Resolution 16/15. “Role of international cooperation in support of national efforts for the realization of the rights of persons with disabilities”&#xa0;The Human Rights Council […] OP8.
