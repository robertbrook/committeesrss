"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by ProMetic BioSciences Ltd (BTO0012)Declaration of interest\nProMetic\n \nBioSciences\n Ltd has developed products and technology for the capture of \nprion\n infectivity from human blood and plasma products and as a consequence has a financial interest in \nprion\n safety of blood products.\nExecutive Summary\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProMetic\n Biosciences, in collaboration with the American Red Cross, has developed a technology based upon selective adsorption of \nprion\n proteins which enables the capture of \nvCJD\n infectivity from human blood and blood-derived components and products.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProMetic’s\n  technology, commonly referred to as \nprion\n filtration, has been incorporated into a medical device (P-Capt™) developed in conjunction with and commercialized by \nMacopharma\n SA which provides increased blood safety by removal of \nvCJD\n infectivity (if present) from Red Blood Cell Concentrates (RBC). \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe P-Capt device obtained CE Mark approval in 2006, and since this time has been under evaluation by the UK’s National Blood Service (NHSBT) but never implemented.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe same technology, in a different format, has been used successfully by Swiss company \nOctapharma\n AG to provide an increased level of \nprion\n safety for virally-inactivated (S/D-treated) plasma for transfusion.  \nOctaplas\n LG™ manufactured using \nProMetic’s\n \nprion\n reduction technology has been approved for human administration in several countries including the UK. \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the absence of a commercial blood test with sufficient sensitivity and robustness for use in routine blood donor screening, the adoption of \nprion\n filtration would provide increased protection against the transmission of \nvCJD\n via blood and blood-derived products.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPrion\n reduction technology constitutes a safe and proven approach to improving the safety of blood products independent of the availability of a \nvCJD\n blood screening test.\n&#xa0;January 2014\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n Reduction of TSE infectivity from human red blood cells using \nprion\n protein affinity \nligands\n.
