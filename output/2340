defaultCan you send my concerns to the 
defaultoffroading
default 
defaultcommittee.
default&#xa0;
defaultI enclose photos of damage caused and the Peak National Park 
defaultseem
default to allow is to continue?
default&#xa0;
defaultI farm an upland area and the 
defaulttracks to the moor was
default a green lane and one could drive an escort van around when visiting stock. (
defaultonly
default 15 years ago) now even a hard walk
default&#xa0;
defaultThe routes used are basically drover routes and now 4x4 s quad bikes and trials bikes come in their 100s and are wrecking the place.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Planning committee promised a TRO once they had the powers to close and now 
defaultthats
default years ago.
default&#xa0;
defaultPlease get the area around 
defaultBrough
default and 
defaultShatton
default as restricted (farm and access to land only)
default&#xa0;
defaultI have had to stop complaining as I have seen retaliation by 
defaultoffroaders
default knocking my walls down, I take photos and am often chased by trespassing offenders (a dodgy job instructed by the Police ? ) , as a farmer if we did any land damage it would 
defaulteffect
default our single farm payment on environmental reasons.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Planning authority should plan and find sites for the 
defaultoffroaders
default to play on, good sites could become a business and then taxed rather than the 85 k the DCC have just paid out to repair (just sections)
