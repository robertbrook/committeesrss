[normal]Can you send my concerns to the 
[normal]offroading
[normal] 
[normal]committee.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I enclose photos of damage caused and the Peak National Park 
[normal]seem
[normal] to allow is to continue?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I farm an upland area and the 
[normal]tracks to the moor was
[normal] a green lane and one could drive an escort van around when visiting stock. (
[normal]only
[normal] 15 years ago) now even a hard walk
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The routes used are basically drover routes and now 4x4 s quad bikes and trials bikes come in their 100s and are wrecking the place.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Planning committee promised a TRO once they had the powers to close and now 
[normal]thats
[normal] years ago.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Please get the area around 
[normal]Brough
[normal] and 
[normal]Shatton
[normal] as restricted (farm and access to land only)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I have had to stop complaining as I have seen retaliation by 
[normal]offroaders
[normal] knocking my walls down, I take photos and am often chased by trespassing offenders (a dodgy job instructed by the Police ? ) , as a farmer if we did any land damage it would 
[normal]effect
[normal] our single farm payment on environmental reasons.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Planning authority should plan and find sites for the 
[normal]offroaders
[normal] to play on, good sites could become a business and then taxed rather than the 85 k the DCC have just paid out to repair (just sections)
