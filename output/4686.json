"&#xa0;\nAFS0089Written evidence submitted by Peter Cansell&#xa0;Points to be addressed&#xa0;&#xa0;There is no evidence to support this. Inde\ned most voluntary converters have not changed things, so why would it work?\nThis process has taken a very long time to become embedded, if\n indeed this now the case. It is extremely expensive, especially in terms of staffing in Local Authorities. \n \nSchools forced to become academies because they are judged to be inadequate are often back to being graded as good before a sponsor is identified, \nthey should therefore have the choice of not becoming an academy but this option seems not to exist.\nThis role is totally unsustainable and the appointment of new regional panels would suggest that the secretary of state has finally recognised this. It would seem that there is a possibility that this will eventually lead to the establishment of something \nsimilar to \nsome of \nthe role\ns\n previously played by Local Authorit\nies.\nThis is proving to be a nightmare for Local Authorities in respect of pupil place planning, standards and safeguarding. There seems to be n\no consideration of local needs by the secretary of state when funding academy expansion. No consultation takes place regarding capital funding. When there is a need locally for extra places the Local authority has no powers to require academies to expand, \nif all schools become academies how will this be resolved?\nIt appears that some chains \nare only in it for the money. They \nare not \naccountable \nto the elected Local Authority and are not required to keep Local Authorities informed. Education is for the betterment of all children regardless of where they live and this entitlement is being erode\nd by inward looking, self seeking organisations. There are no chains who are capable of managing even a medium sized local authority collection of schools and there is no requirement for them to work together as chains, thus defeating the object of being m\nore collaborative. Who are the people with control over these bodies? They are not elected, they do not need to have academic qualifications and it appears from recent events that they often do not regard their staff in schools to require these either. It \ncould be very soon that questions are raised about who is running our schools, in the way that other organisations who have taken over public sector responsibilities in recent years, have been found wanting.\nThe academy model is designed for larger schools, therefore most \nprimaries do not fit the model. Th\ne small number of \n schools which have converted\n, do not report much change in the working of their school , they do note that many of the services they require need to be bought back from a Local Authority in order to ensu\nre that they have some backup if things go wrong. This is often provided at the expense ofÂ  those schools which remain maintained as the infrastructure is often paid for out LA top slice. Collaborative groups of school could bring value for money, but it d\noes not need \nacademisation\n to gain this \nMany primary schools currently perceive federation without academy status to offer many of the advantages of academy status without the major complexities of changing their status\n.\nThere has been an enormous sum of m\noney spent nationally and locally in trying to oblige primary schools to become academies by a variety of means, such as bribery and coercion, this programme has resulted in only about a 10 percent success rate, with such a poor return on the investment wh\nen will someone question whether this is an acceptable waste of public money?\nThe current measures taken are support by local authorities and \nby HMI, these are al\nready generally successful. In many cases LAs support schools to become good at their expense before being obliged to hand them over to a commercial sponsor. \nNo. The recent cases where it has been revealed that the true level of investment by sponsors has been minimal or \nnon existent\n, with massive profits being gained through leasing land, or buildings \nback to the school \nwhich have effectively been g\niven to the sponsor by a Local Authority, are outrageous. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
