"Written evidence from Arthritis Research UK (LTC 66)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOverview\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nObesity as a contributory factor to \nlong term conditions and how it might be addressed\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe interaction between mental health conditions and long term physical conditions\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPe\nrsonalised services for patien\nts (Personalised health budgets;\n Care planning)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFollowing recent pilot\ning\n, the Department of Health\n \nhas \nannounced the initial roll out of personal health budgets\n (PHBs)\n in England\n, which aim to give people with long term conditions greater choice, flexibility and control over their health services and the support they receive.\n \nFrom\n \nApril 2014\n,\n \nall people receiving \nNHS Continuing Healthcare will have the right to ask for a personal health budget\n, whilst clinical commissioning g\nroups and NHS England will be able to offer PHBs more widely\n.\n&#xa0;\nHowever, as arthritis and other musculoskeletal conditions were not the \ndedicated \nfocus of any of the pilot sites, Arthritis Research UK undertook work to ensure the perspectives of people with these conditions was heard.\n&#xa0;\nOur August 2012 report \nPersonal Health Budgets \npresents the findings of our survey, workshop and policy seminar,\n \nand \nincludes five recommendations \nfor action as PHBs become more widely available on the NHS:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFor many musculoskeletal conditions, \nsuch as\n back pain and osteoarthritis, effective day-to-day self-management can make a substantial difference to the overall impact of the condition on a person’s health and wellbeing.\n We believe that a systematic approach to care planning can benefit people with arthritis and other musculoskeletal conditions, and that care planning offers important opportunities to deliver improvements in their care. \n&#xa0;\nAlthough the term \n‘\ncare planning\n’\n is not used directly, NICE clinical guidelines recommend the development of a management plan for people with osteoarthritis, and \nthe offer of an annual review to people with rheumatoid arthritis\n.\n,\n However, recent \nsurvey \nestimates suggest that only 18% of people with osteoarthritis\n and 20% of people with rheumatoid arthritis\n have an agreed care plan.\n,\n&#xa0;\nA welcome recent development is the introduction of rheumatoid arthritis \ninto the\n Quality and Outcom\nes Framework (QOF) for 2013/14. In addition to maintaining a register of people with rheumatoid arthritis, GPs will\n be incentivised to \nensure patients have an annual face-to-face review\n,\n \nwhich\n may\n provide an \nimportant\n opportunity to systematically integrate care p\nlanning conversations for people with rheumatoid arthritis\n. \nThis \nis the first time that measures\n for people with rheumatoid arthritis\n have been included\n – other measures included are fracture and cardiovascular risk assessments.\n \nWhile this new addition to the QOF represents a valuable opportunity to improve the management of rheumatoid arthritis, it is also important to ensure there is effective communication between primary and secondary care.\n&#xa0;\nMusculoskeletal conditions are generally long term conditions which often fluctuate over time. For example, rheumatoid arthritis is often categorised by periods of flare-up interspersed with periods in which symptoms lessen.\n This is something that the care planning process should take into account. \nMuch can be learnt from extending the model of high quality proactive care that has driven \nimprovement in diabetes –\n particularly\n the Year of Care programme which focused on the practicalities of the delivery of care planning in primary care settings.\n \n&#xa0;\nC\nare planning \nshould not be\n an isolated exercise and records and plans \nshould be\n described in language which is accessible and familiar to the person involved\n, along with clear communication about how the process works\n.\n \nWe welcome the development that has already been made in this area, with the recently revised NHS Constitution now including the pledge ‘to involve you in discussions about planning your care and to offer you a written record of what is agreed if you want one’.\n \n&#xa0;\nOver time, we \nwish\n to see care planning embedded across the NHS for people with long term conditions. In particular, we ask that NHS England meets the commitment set out in its mandate that ‘everyone with a long term condition … will be offered a personalised care plan that reflects their preferences and agreed decisions’.\n \n&#xa0;\nThe e\nffects of multimorbidit\ny and ageing\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe implications of an ageing population\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nMay 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nHouse of Commons Health Select Committee (2013), \nInquiry on the management of long term conditions: Call for evidence\n.\n \nArthritis Research UK (2010), \nWorking in partnership towards a future free from arthritis: our research strategy 2010-2015\n.\n \nRight Care (2011), \nThe NHS Atlas of Variation in Healthcare.\n \nDepartment of Health (2011), \nEngland level data by programme budget: 2010-11\n.\n \nArthritis Research UK National Primary Care Centre, \nKeele\n University (2009), \nMusculoskeletal Matters\n.\n \nWorld Health Organisation (2013), \nChronic diseases and health promotion: chronic rheumatic conditions\n: http://www.who.int/chp/topics/rheumatic/en/, accessed 23 Apr 2013.\n \nChristopher J L Murray \net al.\n (2013), \nUK health performance: findings of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010\n, Lancet 381:9871, 997-1020.\n \nArthritis Research UK (2009), \nMusculoskeletal Matters\n.\n \nJulia \nHippisley\n-Cox and Yana \nVinogradova\n (2009), \nTrends in Consultation Rates in General Practice 1995/6 to 2008/9: Analysis of the \nQResearch\n database\n, NHS Information Centre for Health and Social Care.\n E Thomas \net al.\n (2004), \nThe prevalence of pain and pain interference in a general population of older adults: cross-sectional findings from the North Staffordshire Osteoarthritis Project (\nNorStOP\n)\n, Pain 110:1-2, 361-8.\n Arthritis Care (2012), \nOA Nation\n.\n Elliott \net al.\n (1999), \nThe epidemiology of chronic pain in the community\n, Lancet, 354:9186, 1248-52.\n For statistical information about osteoarthritis, see: http://www.arthritisresearchuk.org/arthritis-information/data-and-statistics/osteoarthritis\n \nDepartment of Health (2011), \nEngland level data by programme budget: 2010-11\n.\n National Joint Registry for England and Wales (2012), \n9\nth\n Annual Report\n.\n Health and Safety Executive (2012),\n Annual Statistics Report 2011/12\n.\n Oxford Economics (2010), \nThe economic costs of arthritis for the UK economy\n.\n Arthritis Research Campaign (2009), \nOsteoarthritis and Obesity\n.\n Arthritis Research Campaign (2009), \nOsteoarthritis and Obesity.\n Arthritis Research Campaign (2009), \nOsteoarthritis and Obesity.\n Arthritis Research Campaign (2009), \nOsteoarthritis and Obesity.\n National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (2008), \nCG 59\n \nOsteoarthritis: the care and management of osteoarthritis in adults\n.\n Bruce Guthrie \net al.\n (2012), \nAdapting clinical guidelines to take account of multimorbidity\n, British Medical Journal 345:6341, 1-5.\n \nHansard HC Deb 1 February 2012, \nvol\n 539, \ncol\n 680W.\n Arthritis Research UK, British Heart Foundation, Depression Alliance, Diabetes UK, National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society, Macmillan Cancer Support (2012), \nTwice as likely: putting long term conditions and depression on the agenda\n.\n Y \nGleicher\n \net al.\n (2011), \nA prospective study of mental health care for comorbid depressed mood in older adults with painful arthritis\n, BMC Psychiatry 12:11, 147.\n Arthritis Research UK, British Heart Foundation, Depression Alliance, Diabetes UK, National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society, Macmillan Cancer Support (2012), \nTwice as likely.\n NICE (2008), \nCG59 Osteoarthritis:\n t\nhe care and management of osteoarthritis in adults\n.\n E H Lin \net al\n.
