defaultSensationalist media interpretation and reporting needs to be set aside in favour of robust analysis of the evidence and to uphold the cardinal principle held by all stakeholders: ‘the right placement at the right time for the right child at the right cost.’
defaultI would be happy to give evidence in person to the Committee.
defaultThe person making this submissiondefaultJonathan Stanley, the Chief Executive Officer of the ICHA, has 40 years of working in residential child care across local authority, voluntary and independent sectors, managing residential and associated integrated provision (education, care, health) for national resources that address the learning, emotional, and social needs of young people. He is Principal Partner of the National Centre for Excellence in Residential Child Care.

defaultDistance as a factor in placementdefaulthttp://www.icha.org.uk/uploads/files/icha_research_review___placement_at_distance__from_home__jan__2012__1.pdf
defaultN.B. The DfE research ‘A long way from home’ of 2012 has not been made public. default31.
default 
defaultSome children may need local placements and others more distant one
defaults.
default  There may well be a ‘correct proportion’ but no one knows what it is and the proportion of local placements needed is certainly not 100%. 
default 
defaultThe evidence is clear that local placement
default,
default as a universal rule
default,
default is the wrong conclusion.
default32.
default 
defaultWe need to approach placement choice with the sophistication that includes instrumental and expressive (psychological, dynamic) dimensions. 
default 
defaultIn the main and where there is purpose, children are more able to accept additional, concerned and loving parental figures in their lives, with all the confusion inherent in such situations, than accept the loss of meaningful figures.
default33.
default 
defaultThe decision on whether a child should be locally placed has to be a 
defaultclinical
default one that takes account of the relationship between child and family, the effect on the child of the local environment, and the purposes and quality of the placement
default.
default34.
default 
default defaultSimple instrumental factors such as distance between the placement and the child’s home are less important than the relationships among and the aspirations of care-givers in the placements’ (Lost in Care 1985).
default&#xa0;defaultOut Of Authority placementsdefault35.
default 
defaultForthcoming research suggests that placements away from home are often made to secure specialist provision for children with complex disabilities or severe mental health issues, or to establish some geographical distance to break patterns of risky behaviour (child sexual exploitation, offending behaviour, gangs and guns).
default 
defaultThere is nothing to say that being local increases knowledge and intelligence about the quality of homes or the suitability of their location. 
default 
defaultDo we know if social work oversight is increased? Family work can be a task given successfully to the very skilled practitioners in this work in children’s homes. 
default 
defaultIt is not only social workers who can do this task. 
default36.
default 
defaultWe need a clear definition of Out Of Authority. 
default 
defaultCurrently it can mean round the corner or over the road.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultQuestion – are we not at a point where we can say that children’s homes are offering a national service?default&#xa0;defaultWe are now sharing a high-level needs service across the country. default defaultThis has happened without strategy. default defaultIf we now apply strategy to itdefault, defaultwe might make better or even best use of this national service.default&#xa0;defaultIt is not possible for any local authority to always meet all needs. default We defaultshould not be asking them to do so.default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultLocationdefault37.
default 
defaultGovernment figures show that areas with a current density of homes (North West, West Midlands, Kent) have always had more homes. 
default 
defaultThis arises out of their historical development. 
default38.
default 
defaultThe picture is changing. 
default 
defaultIt will change more quickly if the Government had a national strategy for residential child care. 
default 
defaultThere are no current DfE proposals for this. 
default39.
default 
defaultThe change is complicated by new demands by some local authorities for planning permission for children’s homes.
default 
default A recent debate in Parliament recorded that such hurdles are not supported by legislation. 
default40.
default 
defaultFurther requirements, such as 
defaultany bureaucracy surrounding 
defaultsafe area checks, will slow the changes desired by Government.
default41.
default 
defaultThere is no direct correlation between location of children's homes and level of deprivation. (page 38)
default42.
default 
defaultThe title of page 39, ‘
defaultThere is a slight skew towards deprived areas in the location of the 1,718 homes by local levels of crime and disorder’ requires more context

default 
defaultThere is no data
default presented in the DfE data pack regarding the level of deprivation of local authorities and their use of homes. 
default 
defaultOpportunity to do so was possible here and in pages 22 – 41. 
default 
defaultThis could be an informative study.

defaultThe costs reported in the DfE data pack are extrap

default 
defaultThe most accurate costs were collated by the National Centre for Excellence in Residential Child Care and Revolution Consulting
default,
default through an FOI to all local authorities.

defaultThese figures

defaultlocal authorities are the best information ever on this sector.
defaultPrivate and voluntary average cost per week is £2,841
defaultLocal

default46.
default 
defaultComparative costings of local authority and other homes
default,
default is not advisable.
default 
default The two cohorts are not comparable, sizes and needs often diverge. 
default 
defaultThere is also a likely under
default-
defaultcosting of local authority homes.
default 
default There is a need for a level playing field that can determine one method of calculating costs.
