defaultWitnesses:
default 
defaultSir Robert Rogers KCBdefault, Clerk of the House of Commons, and 
defaultDavid Beamishdefault, Clerk of the Parliaments, gave evidence.
defaultChair:default Good morning. Thank you very much indeed for coming along and thank you very much for your paper. Can I explain that I am in the Chair because Graham Allen thought that he was going to be away? He was indeed away in Copenhagen but has had to come back because the pairing arrangements have broken down, so he is here. He may participate at some stage, but he has asked me to carry on in the Chair. I will ask Paul to ask the first question.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ1 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Flynn:default Could you outline the role of the authorities in both Houses in the process of seeking and obtaining consent?
defaultSir Robert Rogersdefault: Before I attempting to answer Mr Flynn’s question, might I make a declaration of interest, Mr 
defaultChope
default? My daughter is an associate solicitor at 
defaultFarrer’s
default, but she has absolutely nothing to do with legislative consent matters. I have not spoken to her on the matter or consulted her in any way, but I felt that in the interests of punctiliousness I should put that beyond a doubt. 
defaultThe Clerks of Legislation look at Bills in draft and it is one of the things, including, for example, money cover, scope and so on, that they will discuss with Parliamentary Counsel. It is a matter on which the Clerks of Legislation in both Houses always agree. They will take the necessary steps to allow consent to be signified at the stage of the Bill where it is appropriate. Our paper points out that where particularly prerogative matters are absolutely central to the purpose of the 
defaultBill, that
default will be at the Second Reading; otherwise it is at Third.
defaultDavid Beamishdefault: There is little I need say except that it is apparent from what Robert has said, whichever House a Bill starts in, we get the same answer in both Houses. The two Clerks of Legislation work closely together to ensure that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ2 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Flynn:default It is the responsibility of the House to decide whether consent is required or not on the Bills. How do you make the decision between yourselves? Are there disputes?  Are there differences between what should have consent and what should not?
default&#xa0;
defaultSir Robert Rogersdefault: As is implied in our paper, the decisions are usually pretty straight forward. In some of the examples of Queen’s consent that you have, there would be very little doubt as to whether consent would be required or not.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ3 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Flynn:default How do you inform the Private Member when he or she has a Bill on this? At which point do you advise them that consent is required?
default&#xa0;
defaultSir Robert Rogersdefault: As soon as a need for consent is identified, the Clerk in charge of Private Members’ Bills in the Public Bill Office in the Commons will tell the Private Member and will outline the process for getting consent.
defaultDavid Beamishdefault: Similarly, if it is a Lords Bill, with the peer in charge in the Lords.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ4 default&#xa0; 
defaultFabian defaultHamiltondefault:default Sir Robert, good morning. The Office of Parliamentary Counsel pamphlet on consent states, “The issue of consent is entirely a matter of House procedure and becomes redundant once a Bill has received Royal Assent”. Do you agree that consent is entirely a matter of House procedure?
default&#xa0;
defaultSir Robert Rogersdefault: I would say it is a convention that is reflected in House procedure. It is certainly not a matter of statute, and I would see no case for it being a matter of statute. Were the arrangement to be changed, it would not require, for example, primary legislation. It would be something that would be in the hands of both Houses.
defaultDavid Beamishdefault: If I could add to that, I think what that quotation is saying is that, from the lawyers’ point of view, they need not look behind the Bill once it has passed. If this Committee were to recommend a change, certainly in the Lords following precedent, we would start by doing an address to the Crown, inviting the Queen to put her prerogative and interests at our disposal, so we could review the procedures, but that is an internal choice.
defaultSir Robert Rogersdefault: From the Commons’ perspective, I think an address would probably be the right course as well.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ5 default&#xa0; 
defaultFabian defaultHamiltondefault:default Why is consent necessary in addition to Royal Assent, particularly given that if the need for consent is not noticed until after a Bill has received Royal Assent, the legislation is still valid? It seems rather unnecessary.
default&#xa0;
defaultSir Robert Rogersdefault: I would not single out consent as being something that if required but not obtained does not invalidate a statute if it is properly passed in other ways. If there is 
defaultan informality
default in the process of passing a Bill—I would not like to imply that we are constantly making mistakes, but even in the best regulated circles the odd mistake does happen—that sort of informality, nothing at all to do with legislative consent, certainly would not deprive a statute of its legitimacy. Of course, with article 9 of the Bill of Rights, the court could not look behind the process of passing that. It is a wholly different phenomenon from Royal Assent. From my perspective, and I think David may agree with this, I see it as part of the comity between what are after all the three parts of Parliament, the Queen, the Queen in Parliament and the two Houses. That sort of comity or 
defaultcourtesy reflects the relations that there 
defaultare
default between the two Houses, so I would see it rather in that light.
defaultDavid Beamishdefault: I certainly agree and I have in front of me Professor Brazier’s evidence to you, paragraph 24.2, where he uses much the same formula, “The requirement of royal consent is matter of comity between Parliament and the Crown”. So in one sense it is not necessary, in that this Committee could recommend its abolition, but it chimes with other ways in which the three parts of Parliament work together.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ6 default&#xa0; 
defaultFabian defaultHamiltondefault:default We had evidence from Dr Tucker from the 
defaultUniversity
default of 
defaultYork
default, which is where I got my degree, and he told us that, “Consent lacks a compelling constitutional justification”. Would you agree?
default&#xa0;
defaultSir Robert Rogersdefault: There are degrees of the nature of compelling. It is not central to our constitutional arrangements. In terms of the justification, I think that is something that you, as a Committee, will no doubt form a view on, and I would not add to my previous remark about comity, which from my point of view sums it up.
defaultDavid Beamishdefault: Whether it is compelling or not is perhaps a matter for this Committee. I was not entirely persuaded by Dr Tucker in claiming that there was no convention behind consent because it did not pass the 
defaultJennings
default test. He recited in his paragraph 23 possible reasons or arguments for treating consent as passing the third limb of the Jennings test, that is to say there is a reason for the rule, but it seems to me that what Robert said in the previous answer, and what I quoted from Professor Brazier, gives a perfectly respectable reason.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ7 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default If Parliament was minded to abolish consent, what would need to be done?
default&#xa0;
defaultSir Robert Rogersdefault: I think we go back to the route of the address, which we mentioned a few minutes ago. It would be a matter of the Houses saying to the Crown, “We don’t think there is a requirement for that any more. Will you place what would otherwise be your discretion—however trammelled by the advice of Her Majesty’s Ministers of course, as is made clear in our paper and other written evidence before you—to abolish it?”
default&#xa0;
defaultQ8 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Could that be done by way of a resolution, rather than by parliamentary legislation?
default&#xa0;
defaultSir Robert Rogersdefault: Yes. I am always discouraging about the possibility of primary legislation where the workings of Parliament are concerned, but in this case I do not think that it would be a question that would arise. It is a matter of the relationship between the two Houses and the Crown, and the two Houses could make their views known by that route, by an address to the Crown.
defaultDavid Beamishdefault: In the Lords, it would be a two-stage process: stage 1 an address to the Crown, to which the Queen would say yes, so we could consider it, and then stage 2, armed with that authority, the resolution in each House.
defaultSir Robert Rogersdefault: It would be two stages in the Commons as well.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ9 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default How would that interact with the 
defaultScotland
default Act 1998, which specifically refers to the process of consent?
default&#xa0;
defaultSir Robert Rogersdefault: Schedule 3, paragraph 7, I think, of the Scotland Act does that, but it does it in a permissive way. If there were no process of Queen’s consent in the Westminster Parliament, I think that provision would simply wither on the vine. It would no longer be applicable.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ10 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default The Leader of the House told us that a request for consent carries with it, by implication, ministerial advice that consent should be granted. It appears to follow that consent has not been refused when sought. Are you aware of any examples of consent being refused, as against not being sought?
default&#xa0;
defaultSir Robert Rogersdefault: Not in addition to the way that we have covered the issue in our paper. I think it is important to emphasise that we are the consumers, rather than players, all the way through the process. What we want to know is has 
defaulta consent
default been given and if it has then the necessary parliamentary machinery simply turns, but we do not look behind that to see what advice may or may not have been offered, nor indeed what view may have been taken within Government.
defaultDavid Beamishdefault: I associate myself with that answer, so the short answer is, no, we are not aware.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ11 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default There is record in the journals of occasions on which consent has been signified. Is there any record of occasions on which the House authorities have advised that consent is needed for a Private Member’s Bill and the Government have decided not to seek consent?
default&#xa0;
defaultSir Robert Rogersdefault: There are occasions and it does arise, and we have quoted examples in our paper. It may be that the Government takes the view that a Private Member’s Bill, particularly towards the end of the Private Members season, has so little chance of ever becoming law that it is a hoop that it is unnecessary to go through. It may be something on which you would want to seek a first-hand view from the Government.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ12 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Current practice seems to be more in tune with saying, “Let’s allow the Private Member’s Bill to proceed and request the necessary consent.” That is certainly what happened with my Private Member’s Bill, the House of Lords (Maximum Membership) Bill.
default&#xa0;
defaultSir Robert Rogersdefault: Absolutely. I think we have two things at play here. One is a Bill that may well have a realistic chance of debate, even if not progress, and one that is perhaps on, as we irreverently call it, the massacre of the innocents day, the very last day of Private Members’ Bills 
defaultwhere
default clearly no further progress can be made. It is analogous in a way to the Government providing a money resolution for a Private Member’s Bill. It is possible for the Government to say, “No, we don’t like this Bill, so we are not going to provide a money resolution for it.” That would inhibit or possibly prevent debate. When I was Clerk of Legislation—and I think 
defaultJacqy
default Sharpe, the current incumbent—we would always say to the Government that is a misuse of the privilege of financial initiative. The real question is on the nature of the Bill. So it is simply a permissive or facilitating process to have the money resolution. In the same way, I would say that argument applies to consent as well.
defaultDavid Beamishdefault: We do not have any examples in the Lords because we do not have money resolutions and the same rules on time for Private Members’ Bills.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ13 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Flynn:default Is the consent anything more than a piece of anachronistic litter?
default&#xa0;
defaultSir Robert Rogersdefault: I think it would be pretty clear from the answers we have given you already that that is a path down which we would feel very uncomfortable treading to comment on your question. We had better reserve our position and stay exactly where we were in the first answer.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ14 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Flynn:default How would it affect the country if it was abolished? What terrible things would happen?
default&#xa0;
defaultSir Robert Rogersdefault: I would go back to our earlier 
defaultanswers, that
default this is not a central plank of our constitutional arrangements that, if removed, legislative or parliamentary disaster would follow. We have described it in the proportionate way in which it does form part of our constitutional arrangements, and we have given you an indication of why we think that it is an appropriate thing to happen. But as to the value judgment that is implied in your 
defaultquestion, that
default is for you and not for us.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ15 default&#xa0; 
defaultFabian defaultHamiltondefault:default That is extremely diplomatic. Do either of you believe that the process of consent could be used by the Government as a way of curtailing or preventing parliamentary debate?
default&#xa0;
defaultSir Robert Rogersdefault: It could be, but in my answer to the Chairman I think I indicated that it is something that we would think was inappropriate. In terms of either House dealing with a proposal, it is much better to focus on the issue that is actually in the Bill rather than to use a piece of clockwork, as it might be, to prevent the resolution of the issue that is in the Bill.
defaultDavid Beamishdefault: Once again, I associate myself with that answer. I do not think it would happen but if there were any whiff that it might I think I would be very quickly giving very firm advice against to whoever in Government was suggesting it.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ16 default&#xa0; 
defaultFabian defaultHamiltondefault:default That is pretty clear. Could the process of obtaining or signifying be simplified in any way?
default&#xa0;
defaultSir Robert Rogersdefault: I think it could. Not obtaining, that is not a matter for us and that is as we have described, but in our memorandum to you we do make some suggestions at paragraph 25 onwards about how it could be simplified.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ17 default&#xa0; 
defaultFabian defaultHamiltondefault:default Do you have anything to add to that, Mr Beamish?
default&#xa0;
defaultDavid Beamishdefault: I think we have said it all. Essentially, it could be done as a book entry rather than take up time in the House and, as paragraph 27 suggests, we could flag up what is going to happen in the interests of perhaps transparency rather than simplification.
default              
defaultFabian defaultHamiltondefault:default Thank you. That is really helpful.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ18 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Finally, it seems as though Erskine May, that great parliamentary bible, has changed its approach to this subject. It used to have quite a voluminous reference to this whole process, which has now been dropped. Why is that?
default&#xa0;
defaultSir Robert Rogersdefault: I don’t think you should read too much into that. The styles of successive editors may regard one area or another as needing more explanation. I think what is in May at the moment is full, perfect and sufficient.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ19 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Thank you very much. Unless there is anything else that you want to add or our Chairman wishes to add—
defaultMr Allen:default Other than to say masterfully chaired, Mr Chairman. 
defaultChair:default If all our meetings were so short and so succinct. We are very grateful to you.
defaultSir Robert Rogersdefault: That is a sentiment with which we cannot but agree, Chairman.
default&#xa0;
defaultWitness
default:
default 
defaultRichard Heatondefault, First Parliamentary Counsel, Cabinet Office, gave evidence.
default&#xa0;defaultChair:default Mr Heaton, thank you very much indeed for coming along and being available at an earlier time than we had expected. I will ask Paul Flynn to ask the first question.
defaultQ20 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Flynn:default The Office of Parliamentary Counsel was initially unwilling to publish its guidance on consent. It had to be ordered to do so by the Information Commissioner and the Information Rights Tribunal. Why was that?
default&#xa0;
defaultRichard Heatondefault: The guidance was part of a whole range of an internal collection of know-how for drafters to tell them how to do their job. It is a very complicated job and there is lots of guidance and learning and bits of legal advice dotted throughout there. When the FOI request was made, we took the view some two years ago that there was legal advice embedded in it. However, we were quite keen to strip out the bits that we could not disclose and make the bulk of it public. Not only have we done that for this bit of guidance—I stress it is really internal guidance, but we wanted to make it publicly available—we have voluntarily done it with the whole set of other guidance as well. The position was originally it was internal advice with lots of legal advice and bits and pieces of advice from the Attorney, which naturally we would not disclose. We took those bits out—there were not many of them—and disclosed the bulk of it, which we were very happy to do.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ21 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Flynn:default What was wrong with the bits you took out?
default&#xa0;
defaultRichard Heatondefault: Nothing was wrong with it.
defaultPaul Flynn:default What would have happened in the public interest if those bits had been published?
defaultRichard Heatondefault: We took the view that it is traditional defence of legal privilege that where the Attorney has given advice to the Government, on the whole that is not made public.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ22 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Flynn:default This is a matter of great importance. It could be about, say, a declaration of war about which the royal prerogative could be exercised. Shouldn’t the public know; shouldn’t voters know the full reasons why you take that stand?
default&#xa0;
defaultRichard Heatondefault: Yes, absolutely. Every sentence of the guidance that was necessary to explain the process and the reasons for getting Queen’s and Prince’s consent remains in the guidance, so it is in substance exactly the same as the material that was held. If you imagine, in a law chambers there are footnotes, there are all sorts of things that are useful for the lawyers to explain background to particular cases but are not necessary to explain the thrust of the guidance when we made it public.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ23 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Flynn:default Do you think the general public would be too stupid to understand the subtlety of the way you go about your business?
defaultRichard Heatondefault: No. We simply took a view. As I say, there were not many excisions. There were a few references to legal advice that we took out, that was all, but it did not affect the substance of the guidance.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ24 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Flynn:default The people asking for this information had to go through the rigmarole of going through freedom of information and so on, and there does not seem to be any substantial reason why you should have been operating a denial of information.
default&#xa0;
defaultRichard Heatondefault: No, and I agree. I came into this job a year and a half ago and decided to launch a programme of voluntarily releasing all our internal guidance. It has required quite a lot of work to make it readable, presentable and easy to follow. I take the view that we are legislating in an arcane world, 
defaultarcanery
default belonging partly to Government and partly to Parliament, and the more we can do to shed light on dusty, opaque corners of the constitution the better. So I was quite keen on getting the whole set of guidance out there, but we needed to make it presentable.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ25 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Flynn:default So it was the fault of your predecessors? This is an argument we hear frequently in this House.
default&#xa0;
defaultRichard Heatondefault: No, transparency has moved on. The trend is towards more open government. There is an Open Government Partnership across 
defaultParliament Square
default today, with 60 countries attending. To use the Government’s phrase, transparency is an idea whose time has come. The trend is towards making things more open. We were happy to ride that wave.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ26 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Flynn:default Our previous witnesses outlined something of the role of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and the process. Could you describe what exactly 
defaultis your role
default?
default&#xa0;
defaultRichard Heatondefault: This is a part of the law-making process that we do our best dutifully to service. As the previous witnesses explained, it is a rule or convention or custom of Parliament. It is a matter between Parliament and the sovereign. When we are preparing a Bill ready to be introduced, there are a number of things that we have to check and get in order and we correspond or telephone or get in touch with the Clerk’s staff on matters like scope, whether money cover is needed, whether Queen’s or Prince’s consent is needed. Generally speaking, we take an initial view because we know the precedents. We then discuss it with the Clerk of Legislation in each House and, as the Clerks have explained, their view is the authoritative one. We then communicate that to the Department. The Department then writes to the respective royal households in a fairly standard way and await a response.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ27 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default The Palace has to be given 14 days notice of the requirement for consent and the relevant Department has to write a letter copied to the sovereign’s solicitors setting out the purpose of the Bill and how it affects the Crown. Does this suggest that the process of obtaining royal consent requires more than the sovereign merely being asked for formal approval and that there is some substance behind it?
default&#xa0;
defaultRichard Heatondefault: It is a part of the constitution that is taken seriously and duly attended to. It is more than a pure formality. It does require a substantive letter and the letter writer to apply their mind to it. As you have seen from the guidance, the letter is copied to 
defaultFarrer’s
default. It is not for me to 
defaultspeculate, but no doubt 
defaultFarrer’s
default can explain to the royal household quite what this Bill is doing. There are substantive bits of correspondence going on. It is one of the things that you have to cover when you are preparing a Bill. There are many other hurdles you have to negotiate and things you have to do, so it is one of those really.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ28 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Can you see any way in which that process could be made simpler?
default&#xa0;
defaultRichard Heatondefault: I read the Clerks’ note on that with interest. On the transparency point, on which they thought of some helpful suggestions, I looked at the parliamentary website last night. You go Bill by Bill, and I could not spot a bit of information saying, “This Bill has received or has not received”. I do not know whether that would be useful. It might be confusing because people might confuse it with Royal Assent, which of course is something entirely different. So in the transparency vein, there are probably more things you could do to signal that this is one of those Bills and has received Queen’s or Prince’s consent. As for simplifying the procedure, copying a letter to the Duchy of Cornwall or to 
defaultFarrer’s
default is not an enormous burden. It is not a big deal.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ29 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default In the case of a Private Member’s Bill, the letter is done by the Minister at the relevant Department, rather than by the Private Member.
default&#xa0;
defaultRichard Heatondefault: Yes, that is right. The Private Member is advised by the Clerk’s staff and then it gets in touch with the Department, which channels the request in the ordinary way.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ30 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default The Private Member does not necessarily see the letter?
default&#xa0;
defaultRichard Heatondefault: I think that is right, although I am not certain.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ31 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default If the Private Member asked for the letter, should it be supplied to the Private Member?
default&#xa0;
defaultRichard Heatondefault: At first blush, I can’t see a reason why not, but can I get back to you on that?
defaultChair:default Thank you.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ32 default&#xa0; 
defaultFabian defaultHamiltondefault:default Mr Heaton, to the best of your knowledge, is legislation ever altered as a result of the consent process?
default&#xa0;
defaultRichard Heatondefault: To the best of my knowledge, no, but I have to add a rider that if it were I would not necessarily know about it. I have to add that rider.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ33 default&#xa0; 
defaultFabian defaultHamiltondefault:default Why not?
default&#xa0;
defaultRichard Heatondefault: There is correspondence going between Departments and the palace. I don’t necessarily see the entirety of the correspondence. I suppose, thinking about it, if the amendment had required the drafter to do something differently I would know. Certainly, in the office knowledge there is no change, which probably suggests that there is no change, but I am just a bit nervous about giving a comprehensive answer.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ34 default&#xa0; 
defaultFabian defaultHamiltondefault:default That is helpful. In your opinion, why is consent necessary in addition to Royal Assent?
default&#xa0;
defaultRichard Heatondefault: I can’t add much to the previous answers. They start from different places, don’t they? The sovereign is one of the tripartite parts of legislature. So at the Royal Assent end of the process it is very clear that the House of Commons, the House of Lords and the sovereign all have to give their agreement to a piece of legislation. The Queen’s consent starts from a different end of the telescope, which is the comity between Parliament and the sovereign. The sovereign has a range of prerogative and other interests, which Parliament on the whole does not encroach into. The Queen’s consent is the sovereign saying, “I put these at the disposal of Parliament for you to legislate as you see fit.” It is a different sort of process.
defaultSlightly anticipating the next question: does it add anything and is it a relic? I suppose for me—and you will take a view on this—it is a living reminder of the constitutional settlement whereby the sovereign actually does, as a matter of constitutional convention, place her interests at the disposal of Parliament. It is one of those 
defaultsort
default of customary, slightly formal aspects of our constitution that reminds us of how we have got to where we are. We do have a sovereign with prerogative powers, but as a matter of convention the sovereign places those prerogative powers at the disposal of Parliament, which is consistent with a constitutional monarchy. So it is a reminder of where we have come from and where we are, is the best I can do.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ35 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Do you rely upon what you have just said as being the justification for continuing this process?
default&#xa0;
defaultRichard Heatondefault: I am not here to argue strongly one way or another. It is clearly a matter for Parliament, and for this Committee in the first instance, to take a view. I suppose I can say there is no great rush in Government to change this, but we await the deliberations of the Committee with interest.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ36 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Are you aware of how the consent operates in the devolved Administrations?
default&#xa0;
defaultRichard Heatondefault: As I think the written evidence has detailed, the devolved legislation, the Scotland Act and the Government of Wales Act, set up a statutory version of this conventional procedure, which I think I agree with Robert falls if this conventional procedure falls. As to the procedure that is followed, I don’t know quite how it works, but I assume it is something very similar. It is not something my 
defaultoffice get
default involved in, but I assume it is something pretty analogous.
defaultChair:default Thank you. Does anybody have any more questions? No. Thank you very much indeed for coming along.
