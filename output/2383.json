"&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by the Children’s Rights Alliance for England (CRAE), (LAI 011) &#xa0;About CRAE&#xa0;\n1. \nThe Children’s Rights Alliance for England (CRAE) seeks the full implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) in \nEngland\n. Our vision is of a society where the human rights of all children are recognised and realised. CRAE protects\n the human rights of children by lobbying government and others who hold power, by bringing or supporting test cases and by using national, regional and international human rights mechanisms. We provide legal information, raise awareness of children’s huma\nn rights, and undertake research about children’s access to their rights. We mobilise others, including children and young people, to take action to promote and protect children’s human rights. Each year we publish a review of the state of children’s right\ns in \nEngland\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Introduction&#xa0;2\n. \nIn 2010\n the Government made a commitment to give due \nconsideration to the \nUnited Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) \nwhen making new law and policy\n. \nThe Government must comply with this commitment when shaping \nits policy in respect of legal aid.\n Any \nreform to legal aid must ensure that it respects, protects and fulfils children’s rights. \nCRAE \nis\n concerned that \nthe \nGovernment’s \nproposals \nfor the reform of legal aid \nshow a serious disregard for children’s rights\n.\n&#xa0;\n3. \nLegal aid is central to the rule of law – it ensures accountability in the event that public bodies breach the law, including those laws which \nprotect\n children’s rights, by allowing people \nto \ncomplain to the courts. Legal aid also makes the law effecti\nve outside of the court room. It makes it a realistic possibility that people can bring a case when their rights are breached – this possibility encourages public bodies to comply with the law. It is also \nan essential element of a fair justice system\n, ensu\nring that it is not only the rich and powerful who can access the courts by providing a vital safety net for those who cannot afford to pay for legal assistance. \nLegal aid is an important aspec\nt of the right to a fair trial\n and the right to a remedy\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n4\n. \nChildren’s rights, as enshrined in the law, are meaningless un\nless children can take action\n \nwhen their\n rights are \nviolated\n. An effective system of legal aid is crucial to ensuring that children are able to access the court to challenge breaches of their ri\nghts. This is recognised by the international human rights bodies. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has said:\nFor rights to have meaning, effective remedies must be available to redress violations.  This requirement is implicit in the \n[UNCRC]\n an\nd consistently referred to in the other six major international human rights treaties.  Children’s special and dependent status creates real difficulties for them in pursuing remedies for breaches of their rights.  So States need to give particular attenti\non to ensuring that there are effective, child-sensitive procedures available to children and their representatives.  These should \ninclude \n…\n access to independent complaints procedures and to the courts with necessary legal and other assistance.\n \n&#xa0;\n5\n. \nT\nhe guidelines adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe \nrelating \nt\no child-friendly justice\n \nare\n intend\ned\n to \nallow\n children to effectively exercise their rights or act upon breach of their rights. \nThey provide\n that\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6\n. \nWithout appropriate legal aid,\n c\nhildren \nwill be left without a remedy when decisions are made which \nbreach their right\ns\n \nand\n \nthey \ndo not have the independent means to fund a legal challenge. \nE\nven those children with strong cases will be unable to pursue them, placing justice beyond the reach of \nmany children, with alarming gaps in protection.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe proposed introduction of a residence test for civil legal aid claimants, so as to limit legal aid to those with a “strong connection” with the UK&#xa0;7\n. \nCRAE does not agree with \nthe introduction of a resi\ndence test for civil legal aid claimants\n.\n \nChildren may have strong cases in relation to crucial aspects of their human rights, such as community care, housing and private family law cases, but be unable to meet the residency test. For example, \nunrecognised\n \ntrafficked children who do not claim asylum\n, the children of undocumented migrants, and British children born abroad\n may all be unable to bring proceedings when their rights are breached if this proposal is implemented\n. \nFurthermore, the test is likely to \nhave a discriminatory impact on certain groups of children, in breach of children’\ns right\n to access justice without discrimination. \nThere must be access to justice and equality before the law for all. The residence test\n clearly undermines both \nof \nthese pri\nnciples\n.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe proposed restriction on the scope of legal aid available to prisoners&#xa0;8\n. \nCRAE does not agree with the proposal to \ncut\n legal aid for \ntreatment cases\n.\n All aspects of prison law should remain within the scope of legal aid for children.\n9\n. \nThe UNCRC is clear that t\nhose children who are placed in custody do not lose their fundamental rights, and must continue to enjoy these to the full extent compatible with their deprivation of liberty. This means that children in custody should enjoy all of\n their rights, including adequate food, clothes, health care, education, family contact, religion and belief, \nplay, privacy and protection from violence and abuse. \nYet CRAE’s work has shown that \nchildren in custody are highly vulnerable to treatment which \nbreaches their rights whilst in prison. \nIt is vital that \nchildren should have \naccess to legal representation to challenge any \nsuch abuses\n. \n&#xa0;\n1\n0\n. \nThe \nGovernment’s \nproposals are based on \nthe \nnotion that \ninternal complaints \nprocedures \nprovide an adequate means of \nredress in respect of\n \ntreatment\n \nissues. \nHowever, \nsuch \nprocedures \nhave been shown to be inadequate to address children’s rights abuses in the past\n.\n \nIn a judicial review brought by CRAE the court found that if a child had \ncomplained in relation to unlawful restraint ‘\nhe would have been met with the riposte that it was perfectly permissible\n’.\n Without recourse to a court, \ninternal complaints mechanisms do not\n secure a\nccess to justice for children. \nThe proposed changes to the\n scope of \nlegal aid in relation to prison matters\n will substantially reduce the prospect of external legal scrutiny and accordingly the authorities’ \naccountability for abuses of children’s rights whilst in prison\n. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;The proposal that providers of legal services in applications for judicial review against public bodies should only be paid for work done on the case if the Court grants permission for the application to proceed &#xa0;\n1\n1\n. \nCRAE does not agree with this \nproposal.\n \nAs the \nMinistry of Justice itself recognised in its earlier consultation on legal aid\n:\n&#xa0;\nIn our view, proceedings where the litigant is seeking to hold the state to account by judicial review are important, because these cases are the means to wh\nich individual citizens can seek to check the exercise of executive power by appeal to the judiciary. These proceedings therefore represent a crucial way of ensuring that state power is exercised responsibly\n.\n1\n2\n. \nJudicial review is a vital \nlegal \nsafeguard against an unlawful \nor unreasonable \ndecision, \nact or omission by a public\n body\n. \nNot only is it central to \npromoting good decision-making by public bodies by making them accountable to the public \nbut \nit \nalso provides an important means \nby which in\ndividuals can hold the state to account \nand seek redress \nin the event that \na public body\n do\nes\n act unlawfully or \nin breach of a child’s fundamental rights. \nAs previously highlighted by the Children’s Commissioner,\n judicial review proceedings have been wide\nly used to uphold children’s rights in nearly every area covered by the UNCRC\n.\n&#xa0;\n1\n3\n. \nThe proposals will undermine the ability of legal representatives to offer legal advice in respect of judicial review, by requiring them to bear the risk that the case may \nbe unsuccessful. \nThis will undermine access to justice for children where their rights have been breached. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;The proposal that legal aid should be removed for all cases assessed as having “borderline” prospects of success&#xa0;1\n4\n. \nCRAE does not agree with this proposal. \nThe pro\nposals could encourage a risk-a\nverse approach by legal providers that would \nundermine access to justice for\n children \nwhere their rights have been breached\n.\n&#xa0;\n1\n5\n. \nIt is often difficult to establish at the outset whether a case is weak or strong. \nAn assessment of a \nchild’s \ncase as borderline\n means that there remains a \nsignificant \nchance that there will be a successful outcome.  \nIt does not mean that the case is witho\nut merit. \nIt simply may not be possible to assess the merits of the case accur\nately because, for example, \nof \ndisputed law or\n fact\ns\n. \nChildren in such cases should not be denied access to justice.\n&#xa0;\n1\n6\n. \nAppropriate legal representation will be particularly \nim\nportant \nin securing access to justice for children in such\n borderline cases which, by definition, are not clear cut. Without representation, \nthere is a serious risk that borderline cases will fail at first instance.  \n&#xa0;\n1\n7\n. \nBorderline cases are often those \nwhich allow the law to develop, and as such are of importance to\n \nthe \nindividual child concerned a\nnd to the wider public interest. I\nt is crucial that \nsuch cases receive the necessary funding to allow important points of law to be tested. \n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nThe contents of \nthis response do not necessarily reflect the view of all CRAE’s member\ns.\n \nGuidelines of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on child friendly justice\n, adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 17 November 201\n0, at the 1098th meeting of the Ministers' Deputies \n \n \nThe Queen (on the application of) The Children’s Rights Alliance for England v The Secretary of State for Justice\n \nand\n \nG4S Care and Justice Services (UK) Limited and Serco Plc (Interested Parties) and Equality and Human Rights Commission (Intervener) \n[2013] EWCA \nCiv\n 34\n .Ministry of Justice (2010)\n \nP\nroposals for the Reform of Legal Aid in \nEngland\n and \nWales\n Consultation Paper.
