"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by TUC (CCS22)The TUC \nis the voice of Britain at work. Our overall objectives are to raise the quality of working life and promote \nequality for all.\n \nTh\nis TUC response has been drafted in consultation with the \nClean Coal Task Group (CCTG)\n, a\n joint energy industry\n/TUC \nbody formed to promote clean coal technologies within the UK. Its terms of reference are: “To identify an appropriate po\nlicy framework and supporting economic instruments and regulatory framework that would take forward the research, development and promotion and initiation of clean coal burn and carbon capture and storage technologies\n.\n”\nExecutive summaryRESPONSE TO QUESTIONSWhat types of CCS technology are currently being developed and how do they differ from one another? CCS technologies are being developed for both the power and industrial sectors\n. The\n most cost effective route map for CCS lies in the deployment of regional CCS capture networks\n for power and industry\n \nin the UK’s industrial heartlands, such as the \nAire\n Valley, and in cluster\n initiatives such as the North E\nast Process Industri\nes (NEPIC) p\nroject\n,\n focussed on petrochemical\ns\n.\nThe power sector leads CCS technology development, principally through well understood and developed processes – pre-and post-combustion and oxy-fuel technologies. \nThe current CCS commercialisation programme is focussed \non two options: at Peterhead, Scotland, a \nfull-scale gas \nCCS \nproject\n, potentially capturing \na million \ntonnes \n \nof CO2\n \n annually; \nand the \n426MWe White Rose demonstration project at \nDrax\n. \nOxyfuel\n \ntechnology\n has been developed in Europe by \nAlstom\n and in the UK\n by \nDoosan\n Babcock and \ncan be applied to both \nn\new and \nretrofit\nted installations.\n \nThere are other full scale projects, such as 2Co Energy’s Don Valley project, in South Yorkshire, proceeding in parallel with the commercialisation programme that intend to ap\nply for a \nFinal Investment Decision (\nFID\n)\n enabling \nContract for Difference (\nCfD\n)\n.\nIn the power sector, one of the three main ways in which greenhouse gas emissions from industrial heat demand can be reduced\n are \nenergy efficiency, fuel switching, and indust\nrial CCS. \nAs the DECC \nHeat Strategy\n acknowledges, industrial CCS could be a key technology for the decarbonisation of industry sector, potentially allowing energy intensive industries to continue using fossil fuels while significantly reducing emissions. \nMuch \nlong-term industrial abatement potential lies in CCS technology\n in i\nndustries which emit carbon from manufacturing process\nes\n \n- \niron and steel, cement, oil refining and chemicals.\nThe TUC concurs with this view of the importance of industrial CCS. In \nan increasingly carbon constrained world, considerable first mover advantages are available from the early development of industry CCS. As DECC points out, industrial facilities which are located close to other industries or power stations and storage site\ns are more likely to be able to implement CCS if they can share transport and storage infrastructure.\n \nIndustrial sectors need to develop and trial a range of capture technologies, for example:\nWhilst we welc\nome the heat strategy, the TUC is concerned at the pace and scale of government support for industrial CCS. Rather than industrial and power CCS technologies developing in parallel, they appear to be moving forward in sequence. For example, there is no ind\nustrial mechanism in the Energy Bill to incentivise industrial CCS.\nWhat contribution could CCS make towards the UK’s decarbonisation targets? Are the UK Government’s expectations reasonable in this regard?CCS contribution: advice from the Committee on Climate ChangeT\nhe Committee on Climate Change \n(CCC) \nestimates\n that the UK’s decarbonising power sector will require \napproximately 18-20GW of CCS for coal and gas by 2030.\nThe \ngovernment’s independent advice from the \nCCC\n provides an energy \nscenario \nto reach the UK’s 2030 energy decarbonisation target. The \npower sector currently accounts for around 25% of UK greenhouse gas emissions. \nAn indicative generation mix to achieve \na carbon intensity of 50-100g/KWh by\n 2030 is 40% nuclear, 40% renewable, 15% CC\nS, and around 5% unabated gas-fired generation. \nWith \npower generation capacity of about 12\n5\nGW by 2030, \nthis \nequate\ns\n to 18\n-20\nGW of CCS for coal and ga\ns\n.\nGiven the long lead times for major infrastructure projects such as these, and the fact none has yet ma\nde its final investment decision, the UK needs to move swiftly if it is to have a realistic chance of achieving this target.\nThe \nCCC’s \np\nower sector scenario for the \nF\nourth \nC\narbon \nB\nudget was designed to develop a portfolio of low-carbon technology options, \nand includes cost-effective investment in mature low-carbon technologies together with investment in less mature technologies required to support learning and innovation.\n The CC conclude that:\n “The current proposal to support four CCS power generation proj\nects (in the Coalition Agreement, reconfirmed in the 2010 Spending Review), would result in a critical mass for potential roll-out from the early 2020s. It is important that a funding mechanism for the four projects is finalised and that these are tendered\n in 2011 to facilitate early deployment\n.”\nThe CCC estimates that \nthe power sector will capture a larger amount of CO2 per year than industry up until 2040, from when power and industry are projected to capture similar quantities annually\n. \nThey state that:\n \n“There is a growing role for CCS in industry through the 2020s, which by 2030 reduces emissions by around 5 MtCO2....\n \nTo ensure that this technology is available for deployment from the 2020s, a policy approach is required which either funds demonstration\n, or ensures that demonstration elsewhere (e.g. under the EU’s CCS demonstration programme) will provide scope for timely deployment in the UK.”\nCO2 Sense – regional CCS infrastructureFrom a regional perspective, \na study by CO2 Sense of \nThe national, regi\nonal and local economic benefits of the Yorkshire and Humber carbon capture and storage cluster\n shows that \nthe successful development of a regional CCS infrastructure \nin the \nAire\n Valley\n \ncould capture \napproximately 60\n \nmillion tonnes \nof carbon emissions \npe\nr year \nfrom power and industry\n sources. The initial ‘core’ cluster \nwould \nact as a catalyst for the establishment of a wider cluster. The core cluster consists of three elements:\nHowever, \nthe \n2Co\n \nproject was not shortlisted under the commercialisation programme, even though \nrank\ned\n \nfirst\n in Europe under the NER300 programme\n,\n and \namong the \ntop ten global CCS project\ns\n by \nBloomberg New Energy Finance\n. To incentivise \nsuch \nCCS investments outside the scope of the commercialisation programme, the government will need to ensure \nthe enabling Contract for Difference for CCS includes appropriate risk sharing for early projects\n. It will also need to provide\n sufficient capacity in the Levy Control Framework to 2020 for CCS capital investment.\nThe UK Government’s expectationsThe Coalition agreement said: “We will continue public sector investment in carbon capture and storage (CC\nS) technology for four coal-fired power stations.” But current ambitions for the CCS commercialisation programme \nwill\n reduce to “up to two projects” receiving final approval\n, according to DECC comments\n, and possibly only a single project\n.\nThe government\n’s\n \nCCS R\noadmap\n \n(2012) \ndoes not provide \ntargets for \nCCS \ndeployment. \nInstead, \nit provides the plain statements of fact that the \npotential CCS storage capacity of the North Sea basin\n is huge\n; and \nthat \nCCS technology is \n“\ncurrently the only means by which fossil \nfuels can be maintained within the UK generation mix, whilst meeting our 2050 carbon targets.\n” \nFrom the TUC’s perspective CCS is at a critical stage. The Coalition’s initial ambition of four CCS demonstration projects would appear to meet the minimum requ\nirement recommended by the CCC. The\n TUC therefore believe the\n government needs to immediately return to its initial ambition for four CCS demonstration projects, and \nensure these can be incentivised quickly through the Final Investment Decision enabling Co\nntracts for Difference (\nCfD\n) that should be available from the end of 2013. It needs to ensure that measures in the Energy Bill incentivise further power sector CCS projects under the \nCfD\n process.\n \nAre there any potential benefits (e.g. the ability to export CCS technology abroad) of successfully developing CCS to the UK economy and, if so, what are they?Yes. \nDECC acknowledges that C\nCS represents a major green growth opportunity for the UK\n stating that “\nIf CCS opportunities develop as anticipated, bene\nfits for UK-based firms have been estimated to be between £3 - 6.5 billion a year by the late 2020s\n.”\nHowever, the government has not developed a comprehensive analysis of the economic, fiscal and social benefits of CCS. The TUC believes that such researc\nh would strengthen the case for CCS deployment.\nDECC envisages \nthe \nCCS Commercialisation Programme \n(launched in April 2012\n)\n as supporting “\na strong and robust supply chain in the UK, creating jobs and markets locally and nationally to serve the early CCS p\nlant and later clusters of CCS activity. Playing to the UK’s business strengths and favouring projects clustering in regions reflects the Government’s ambition to capture opportunities for ‘\ngreen \njobs’ that will arise from an emerging market for CCS, and r\necognises the concerns of UK industry about the development of CCS infrastructure.\n”\n&#xa0;\nIn the UK, \nthe \nCO2 Sense \nstudy (see above) revealed that t\nhe Yorkshire and Humber\n CCS cluster \n \nha\ns\n the potential to generate, both directly and indirectly, an economic i\nmpact totalling some £1.255 billion up to 2030\n. Economic benefits are \ngreatest during the overlap between construction and operation\n \nin 2017 \nwhen \nleast 6,000\n net additional FTE jobs and £245m net\n \nadditional GVA \nare realised\n. \nIts long-term \nregional \neconomic impact by 2050 \ncould exceed\n £26 billion - sustaining and creating thousands of jobs across Yorkshire and the Humber.\n&#xa0;\nAire Valley CCS cluster: peak employment, full time equivalent posts&#xa0;\nProject\nConstruction\nOperation\nMaintenance\nTotal at peak\nDon Valley\n2,229\n251\n37\n2,517\nDrax\n \nOxyfuel\n2,478\n91\n27\n2,596\nCO2 pipeline\n954\n37\n-\n991\nTotal\n5,651\n379\n64\n6,104\n&#xa0;\nS\nource: CO2 Sense. \n&#xa0;\nTh\ne development of CCS clusters/networks – enabling industrial sectors to link in to pre-existing transport and \nstorage infrastructure - will ensure cost-effective decarbonisation of industrial sectors. This is particularly important as many of these sectors cannot afford the full cost of fitting CCS.\n&#xa0;\nA roadmap for coalA major potential benefit from CCS deployment\n will be to secure the long\n-\nterm future for UK coal mining\n and its 9,000 employees.\n \nWithout investment in CCS there is no long term future for the UK coal industry. \n \nActions taken now to invest in CCS \nand reform our electricity market can secure this core industry in a low carbon economy for the long term. Delays will drive investment and dependency on gas fired power without resolving the challenge of CO2 capture, whilst losing a once-only opportunity \nfor global leadership in the vital CCS industry. \nThe UK mines \nin 2012 mined \nover 1\n7\n million tonnes of coal a year, and \nits \ncoal power stations generate over \n38%\n of the UK’s electricity\n \ncompared with \n28\n% from gas generators. At peak times, we turn to the e\nxceptional flexibility of coal power for up to 50% of our electricity supply. Coal \ncurrently \ndirectly provides over \n5\n,000 jobs in deep and surface mines and ancillary functions, whilst coal power stations employ over 4,\n000\n staff, many in skilled quality em\nployment. \nThe government should therefore develop a roadmap for UK coal mining alongside its EMR implementation plan, to provide security for UK coal investors and its workforce.\nWhat are the main barriers (e.g. economic, political, regulatory, scientific and social) to developing large-scale integrated CCS projects in the UK and internationally? How can they be overcome? The\n \nmain barrier to developing CCS \nin this period \nappear\ns to be the slow \nformation and implementation of government energy policy\n to su\npport CCS\n. The \ntwo key strands of government support for \nare EMR reforms and the CCS commercialisation programme. These two processes must work in parallel\n \nto ensure the maximum momentum and technological advance. \nGovernment’s Electricity Market Reform (EMR)The EMR includes \nmeasures\n to support all low-carbon generation with Contracts for Differences (\nCfDs\n)\n \nproviding for \ndeployment of CCS in the power sector. \nKey tests for the EMR if it is to drive CCS investment include: \nThe EMR has so far failed to provide clarity in any of these t\nhree areas. \nThe draft \nEMR \nDelivery Plan\n \n(July 2013) is unhelpful in its range of zero to 12GW of CCS by 2030, with \neven \nthe upper limit almost half of the ambition set out by the Committee on Climate Change, of 18-20GW by 2030.\nThe delivery plan says: \n“B\na\nsed on central demand and decarbonisation assumptions (100g CO2/KWh) \n[the scenario] \nillustrates a generation mix that would be consistent with CCS costs and deployment circumstances being favourable compared to other technologies. In this scenario, three C\nCS plants are built by the end of 2020, with commercial deployment of both gas and coal CCS throughout the 2020s- leading to deployment of around 12 GW CCS in 2030.\n”\nCCS commercialisation programmeThe latest CCS Commercialisation Programme is tasked with \nlaunching a process to ensure the general deployment of CCS for coal and gas by the 2020s. \nFrom an early commitment to four CCS projects, currently there may be support for only one or two. As a bare minimum, the government should rapidly conclude negotiat\nions at \nDrax\n and Peterhead, with a view to plant\n being operational\n by 2018 at the latest. \nMore than that, the government should retain its commitment to four demonstration projects and consider returning to other projects under development, offering them \nclear and speedy alternatives either through the CCS competition or via \nCfDs\n. Sustained deployment is critical at this stage.\nIs the UK Government’s approach, set out in its CCS Roadmap, likely to incentivise development of CCS in the UK?The government’s \napproach lacks the necessary pace and scale. As noted above, currently the main drivers of CCS are reliant on effective government policy. The two key strands of government support for CCS are the EMR reforms and the CCS commercialisation programme. These \ntwo processes must work in parallel, not sequentially, to ensure the maximum momentum, technological advance and robustness of the programme against possible future project cancellations.  At present there is a strong perception that the government is resi\nsting further CCS deployment until the commercialisation projects are underway.\nCould the successful development of CCS improve international efforts to mitigate climate change? What role could UK CCS play in this? Yes. CCS is acknowledged to be a crucial transitional technology for climate change mitigation. The UK has a crucial seedbed role to play, although there is a now a clear danger that other countries will move ahead more rapidly, so that the UK loses techno\nlogical and market leadership. \nIn Canada, the Boundary Dam\n CCS project has been completed, a 110 MW coal pow\ne\nr plant with \nretrofit \nCCS technology\n due to start operating in 2014. The total cost of the project is estimated to be $1.24 billion, with $240 mi\nllion from the federal government in 2011, of which about $180 million has already been spent. The provincial government is also supporting the project. Employment includes 20 at the R&amp;D stage\n, peak\n construction employment of 1,500 and 41 operational emplo\nyees. \nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/190149/16_04-DECC-The_Future_of_Heating_Accessible-10.pdf\n Committee on Climate Change, advice to the Energy Secretary, 13 September 2012.\n Committee on Climate Change, advice to the Energy Secretary, 13 September 2012.\n Committee on Climate Change, Fourth Carbon Budget, December 2010.\n \nhttp://www.co2sense.co.\nuk/files/2113/5031/6058/CCS_CO2Sense_Exec_summary_FINAL.pdf\n \nhttp://www.co2sense.co.uk/files/2113/5031/6058/CCS_CO2Sense_Exec_summary_FINAL.pdf\n \nhttp://www.utilityweek.co.uk/news/news_story.asp?id=198331&amp;title=Final+two+CCS+projects+named\n AEA,  2010, \nF\nuture Value of Carbon Abatement Technologies in Coal and Gas Power Generation to UK Industry. \nhttp://www.decc.gov.uk/assets/decc/What%20we%20do/UK%20energy%20supply/Energy%20mix/Carbon%20capture%20and%20storage/1_20100629105946_e_@@_futurevalueCATUKindustr\ny.pdf.  \n \nCCS Roadmap:\n Supporting deployment of Carbon Capture and Storage in the UK\n, DECC, 2012.\n \nhttp://www.co2sense.co.uk/files/2113/5031/6058/CCS_CO2Sense_Exec_summary_FINAL.pdf\n \nConsultation on the draft Electricity Market Reform Delivery Plan\n, \nDECC, July 2013 -\n https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/223650/emr_delivery_plan_consultation.pdf\n \nhttp://sequestration.mit.edu/tools/projects/boundary_dam.html\n"
