defaultNosheen’sdefault casedefault&#xa0;
defaultNosheen
default came to the 
defaultUK
default on a spousal visa in 2006 to join her British national husband 
defaultand in-laws 
defaultfollowing an arranged marriage in 
defaultPakistan
default. From the outset of her marriage, she was repeated
defaultly
default abuse
defaultd, imprisoned and 
defaultforced to conceive. She 
defaultwas 
defaultforbidden from having contact with her family in 
defaultPakistan
default 
defaultor
default relatives in the 
defaultUK
default.
default She was 
defaultn
defaultot allowed 
defaultto atte
defaultnd her GP surgery 
defaultunless accompanied by her mother-in-law. 
defaultShe therefore had little opportunity to 
defaultfully 
defaultdisclose her experiences
default of abuse and imprisonment
default 
defaultto outsi
defaultde agencies. 
defaultH
defaulter family 
defaultand relatives
default to whom she had disclosed her experiences,
default told her t
defaulto
default ‘adjust’ to her new surroundings and to make her marriage work. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWithin 7 months of her arrival in the 
defaultUK
default, 
defaultNosheen
default was found set alight in her garden. She was taken to hospital 
defaulthaving 
defaultsustained 60% burns. 
defaultNosheen
default was responding well to treatment and at 
defaultt
defaulthe first opportunity
default she had
default,
default 
defaultshe
default told the hospital that she did not want her husband or in-laws to visit her.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe hospital did not act on her wishes and instead allowed her husband and in-laws unrestricted and unsupervised access to her. Following one of 
defaulttheir visits, she 
defaultsuffered catastrophic brain injury
default. The
default 
defaultoxygen ventilator
default 
defaultto which
default she was connected, inexplicably 
defaultbe
defaultc
defaulta
defaultme
default dislodged. As a result of her brain injuries, she is now cortically blind, minimally conscious and needs 24 hour care. Her condition
default is life-long.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn this condition, the UKBA tried to deport her. She was appointed an official solicitor
default and an immigration lawyer
default 
defaultas she could not give instructions. 
defaultThe decision to deport her was challenged
default on medical grounds
default at an appeal tribunal. C
defaultonsi
defaultderable medical evidence was presented to 
defaultshow that 
defaultshe 
defaultwould not 
defaultsurviv
defaulte
default the plane journey and even if she did, 
defaultshe would not 
defaultreceive the specialised
default medical
default care she needed in Pakistan. She won her appeal.
default&#xa0;
defaultD
defaultespite her horrific
default injuries,
default to dat
defaulte, there 
defaulthas been no effective S
defaulttate investigation into how she came to suffer serious harm at her home or at the hospital. 
defaultThe police undertook a
default 
defaultvery superficial investigation 
defaultbased on an initial suspicion that she was 
defaultthe 
defaultvictim of an 
defaulthonour crime
default, although they
default failed to warn the hospital authorities about their suspicions. 
defaultFollowing her brain injury, 
defaultthe police suspended all investigations. 
defaultThe hospital too failed to undertake any investigation into how 
defaultNosheen
default came to suffer her brain injury. 
defaultNosheen’s
default father 
defaulthas been left without any explanation as to why there has been 
defaultno state scrutiny to bear on the matter
default. He 
defaultvisits 
defaultNosheen
default on a daily basis
default at 
defaulta
default nursing home
default where she resides in a near vegetative state.

default&#xa0;defaultDorothydefault’s case default&#xa0;defaultIn November 2008, 
defaultDorothy
default, a Nigerian National, arrived in the UK on a vi
defaultsitor’s visa
default to join her 
defaulthusband
default,
default a British National
default. 
defaultHer two children were born in the UK.
default Followi
defaultng the birth of her second child, 
defaulther husband 
defaultbegan to 
defaultabus
defaulte
default her
default and assault 
defaulther on almost
default daily basis. 
defaultI
defaultn February 2013, he abandoned her 
defaultand the
default children. This was the second occasion that he had abandoned her 
defaultbut she remained hopeful that he would 
defaultreturn
default.
default After a couple of weeks, 
defaultDorothy
default 
defaultran
default out of money 
defaultand food. She was
default breastfeeding her second child
default at the time
default. She turned to social services f
defaultor help and they agreed to assist her for 28 days. 
defaultDorothy also
default tried to
default obtain
default immigration advice 
defaultwhen 
defaultshe realised that her husband had done nothing 
defaultto regularise her stay in the UK. He
default had also taken the children’s British passports with him when he lef
defaultt. 
defaultHowever, as she had no documentation regarding her immigration status, she was unable to resolve her immigration problems within the 28 days. 
defaultAt the end of the 28 day period, social services cut off 
defaulther
default support and accused 
defaultDorothy of not sorting out her
default immigration matter
default. 
defaultThe told her that they would take the children into care. Dorothy
default became homeless. 
defaultShe
default 
defaultinstructed 
defaulta 
defaultcommunity care solicitor
default to act for her and 
defaultSBS 
defaultassisted her for a limited period 
defaultthrough our ‘
defaultNo Recourse Fund
default. This is
default an emergency
default f
defaultund operated by SBS to help abused, destitute and homeless women with insecure status
default. 
defaultDorothy
default’s solicitor
default 
defaultsuccessfully challenged social services’
default decision on the basis that it was unlawful to terminate support to her and her children
default.

default&#xa0;defaultMwahasidefault’ casedefault default&#xa0;defaultMwahasi
default, an Ethiopian National, was forced t
defaulto marry her husband when she was 16 years old. In August 2012, 
defaultMwahasi
default joined her husband in the 
defaultUK
default on a ‘post-flight’ spouse visa. This means that she 
defaultcould 
defaultapply for settled status at a later date. Within a few days of her arrival in the 
defaultUK
default, 
defaultshe was subj
defaultected to repeated domestic and sexual violence by her husband
default. He
default 
defaulttook 
defaulther
default earnings and often 
defaultthreatened to send her back to Ethiopia
default.
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultMwahasi
default felt trapped in her marriage and started self- harming. She 
defaultfeared 
defaultreturning to 
defaultEthiopia
default as a disgraced woman
default.
default By February 2013, 
defaultMwahasi’s
default husband’s behaviour deteriorated to such an extent that she had no choice but to call the police. 
defaultShe was taken to 
defaulta night shelter but her immigration status prevented her
default from claiming welfare benefits.
default SBS assisted 
defaultMwahasi
default in
default finding temporary accommodation from a charit
defaultable
default organisation and in submitting an application for the DDV Concession
default, made on the basis that she had been
default treated by the immigration authorities as a spousal visa applicant. 
defaultHer application 
defaultwas refused. 
default&#xa0;
defaultI
defaultn April 2013
default,
default 
defaultMwahasi
default’s
default 
defaultimmigration solicitor
default 
defaultchallenge
defaultd
default the UKBA’s 
defaultrefusal
default by way of judicial review. The case is currently pending at the High Court
default 
defaultwhich has decided that her 
defaultcase
default raises an important public interest matte
defaultr
default relating to the proper remit of the DDV Concession. In the meantime, she has been given temporary leave to remain by the UKBA, which allows her recourse to public funds. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe

defaultMwahasi
default’s
default applicati
defaulton for exceptional case fundin
defaultg 
defaultto 
defaultmake an application for indefinite leave to remain in the 
defaultUK
default under the DV Rule
default. She was told that 
defaultit would only be granted if there was a successful outcome of the judicial review proceedings
default in respect of
default the DDV Concession.
