[normal]Nosheen’s[bold] case[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Nosheen
[normal] came to the 
[normal]UK
[normal] on a spousal visa in 2006 to join her British national husband 
[normal]and in-laws 
[normal]following an arranged marriage in 
[normal]Pakistan
[normal]. From the outset of her marriage, she was repeated
[normal]ly
[normal] abuse
[normal]d, imprisoned and 
[normal]forced to conceive. She 
[normal]was 
[normal]forbidden from having contact with her family in 
[normal]Pakistan
[normal] 
[normal]or
[normal] relatives in the 
[normal]UK
[normal].
[normal] She was 
[normal]n
[normal]ot allowed 
[normal]to atte
[normal]nd her GP surgery 
[normal]unless accompanied by her mother-in-law. 
[normal]She therefore had little opportunity to 
[normal]fully 
[normal]disclose her experiences
[normal] of abuse and imprisonment
[normal] 
[normal]to outsi
[normal]de agencies. 
[normal]H
[normal]er family 
[normal]and relatives
[normal] to whom she had disclosed her experiences,
[normal] told her t
[normal]o
[normal] ‘adjust’ to her new surroundings and to make her marriage work. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Within 7 months of her arrival in the 
[normal]UK
[normal], 
[normal]Nosheen
[normal] was found set alight in her garden. She was taken to hospital 
[normal]having 
[normal]sustained 60% burns. 
[normal]Nosheen
[normal] was responding well to treatment and at 
[normal]t
[normal]he first opportunity
[normal] she had
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]she
[normal] told the hospital that she did not want her husband or in-laws to visit her.
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he hospital did not act on her wishes and instead allowed her husband and in-laws unrestricted and unsupervised access to her. Following one of 
[normal]their visits, she 
[normal]suffered catastrophic brain injury
[normal]. The
[normal] 
[normal]oxygen ventilator
[normal] 
[normal]to which
[normal] she was connected, inexplicably 
[normal]be
[normal]c
[normal]a
[normal]me
[normal] dislodged. As a result of her brain injuries, she is now cortically blind, minimally conscious and needs 24 hour care. Her condition
[normal] is life-long.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In this condition, the UKBA tried to deport her. She was appointed an official solicitor
[normal] and an immigration lawyer
[normal] 
[normal]as she could not give instructions. 
[normal]The decision to deport her was challenged
[normal] on medical grounds
[normal] at an appeal tribunal. C
[normal]onsi
[normal]derable medical evidence was presented to 
[normal]show that 
[normal]she 
[normal]would not 
[normal]surviv
[normal]e
[normal] the plane journey and even if she did, 
[normal]she would not 
[normal]receive the specialised
[normal] medical
[normal] care she needed in Pakistan. She won her appeal.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]D
[normal]espite her horrific
[normal] injuries,
[normal] to dat
[normal]e, there 
[normal]has been no effective S
[normal]tate investigation into how she came to suffer serious harm at her home or at the hospital. 
[normal]The police undertook a
[normal] 
[normal]very superficial investigation 
[normal]based on an initial suspicion that she was 
[normal]the 
[normal]victim of an 
[normal]honour crime
[normal], although they
[normal] failed to warn the hospital authorities about their suspicions. 
[normal]Following her brain injury, 
[normal]the police suspended all investigations. 
[normal]The hospital too failed to undertake any investigation into how 
[normal]Nosheen
[normal] came to suffer her brain injury. 
[normal]Nosheen’s
[normal] father 
[normal]has been left without any explanation as to why there has been 
[normal]no state scrutiny to bear on the matter
[normal]. He 
[normal]visits 
[normal]Nosheen
[normal] on a daily basis
[normal] at 
[normal]a
[normal] nursing home
[normal] where she resides in a near vegetative state.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Dorothy[bold]’s case [bold]&#xa0;[bold]In November 2008, 
[normal]Dorothy
[normal], a Nigerian National, arrived in the UK on a vi
[normal]sitor’s visa
[normal] to join her 
[normal]husband
[normal],
[normal] a British National
[normal]. 
[normal]Her two children were born in the UK.
[normal] Followi
[normal]ng the birth of her second child, 
[normal]her husband 
[normal]began to 
[normal]abus
[normal]e
[normal] her
[normal] and assault 
[normal]her on almost
[normal] daily basis. 
[normal]I
[normal]n February 2013, he abandoned her 
[normal]and the
[normal] children. This was the second occasion that he had abandoned her 
[normal]but she remained hopeful that he would 
[normal]return
[normal].
[normal] After a couple of weeks, 
[normal]Dorothy
[normal] 
[normal]ran
[normal] out of money 
[normal]and food. She was
[normal] breastfeeding her second child
[normal] at the time
[normal]. She turned to social services f
[normal]or help and they agreed to assist her for 28 days. 
[normal]Dorothy also
[normal] tried to
[normal] obtain
[normal] immigration advice 
[normal]when 
[normal]she realised that her husband had done nothing 
[normal]to regularise her stay in the UK. He
[normal] had also taken the children’s British passports with him when he lef
[normal]t. 
[normal]However, as she had no documentation regarding her immigration status, she was unable to resolve her immigration problems within the 28 days. 
[normal]At the end of the 28 day period, social services cut off 
[normal]her
[normal] support and accused 
[normal]Dorothy of not sorting out her
[normal] immigration matter
[normal]. 
[normal]The told her that they would take the children into care. Dorothy
[normal] became homeless. 
[normal]She
[normal] 
[normal]instructed 
[normal]a 
[normal]community care solicitor
[normal] to act for her and 
[normal]SBS 
[normal]assisted her for a limited period 
[normal]through our ‘
[normal]No Recourse Fund
[normal]. This is
[normal] an emergency
[normal] f
[normal]und operated by SBS to help abused, destitute and homeless women with insecure status
[normal]. 
[normal]Dorothy
[normal]’s solicitor
[normal] 
[normal]successfully challenged social services’
[normal] decision on the basis that it was unlawful to terminate support to her and her children
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Mwahasi[bold]’ case[bold] [bold]&#xa0;[bold]Mwahasi
[normal], an Ethiopian National, was forced t
[normal]o marry her husband when she was 16 years old. In August 2012, 
[normal]Mwahasi
[normal] joined her husband in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] on a ‘post-flight’ spouse visa. This means that she 
[normal]could 
[normal]apply for settled status at a later date. Within a few days of her arrival in the 
[normal]UK
[normal], 
[normal]she was subj
[normal]ected to repeated domestic and sexual violence by her husband
[normal]. He
[normal] 
[normal]took 
[normal]her
[normal] earnings and often 
[normal]threatened to send her back to Ethiopia
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Mwahasi
[normal] felt trapped in her marriage and started self- harming. She 
[normal]feared 
[normal]returning to 
[normal]Ethiopia
[normal] as a disgraced woman
[normal].
[normal] By February 2013, 
[normal]Mwahasi’s
[normal] husband’s behaviour deteriorated to such an extent that she had no choice but to call the police. 
[normal]She was taken to 
[normal]a night shelter but her immigration status prevented her
[normal] from claiming welfare benefits.
[normal] SBS assisted 
[normal]Mwahasi
[normal] in
[normal] finding temporary accommodation from a charit
[normal]able
[normal] organisation and in submitting an application for the DDV Concession
[normal], made on the basis that she had been
[normal] treated by the immigration authorities as a spousal visa applicant. 
[normal]Her application 
[normal]was refused. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I
[normal]n April 2013
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]Mwahasi
[normal]’s
[normal] 
[normal]immigration solicitor
[normal] 
[normal]challenge
[normal]d
[normal] the UKBA’s 
[normal]refusal
[normal] by way of judicial review. The case is currently pending at the High Court
[normal] 
[normal]which has decided that her 
[normal]case
[normal] raises an important public interest matte
[normal]r
[normal] relating to the proper remit of the DDV Concession. In the meantime, she has been given temporary leave to remain by the UKBA, which allows her recourse to public funds. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]L
[normal]egal Aid Agency also refused 
[normal]Mwahasi
[normal]’s
[normal] applicati
[normal]on for exceptional case fundin
[normal]g 
[normal]to 
[normal]make an application for indefinite leave to remain in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] under the DV Rule
[normal]. She was told that 
[normal]it would only be granted if there was a successful outcome of the judicial review proceedings
[normal] in respect of
[normal] the DDV Concession.

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Sudarshan[bold]’s[bold] [bold]c[bold]ase [bold]&#xa0;[bold]Sudarshan
[normal], a 57 year old Pakistani National, 
[normal]was detained by the 
[normal]UK
[normal] Border Agency
[normal] [bold]during an immigration raid in 2007. She
[normal] spent three years in immigration detention during which
[normal] 
[normal]she was 
[normal]ill treated and 
[normal]denied access to urgent medical treatment. 
[normal]She states that 
[normal]immigration officials
[normal] often
[normal] shouted at her and treated her like an 
[normal]‘
[normal]animal
[normal]’ causing her to
[normal] suffe
[normal]r
[normal] a complete mental 
[normal]health breakdown. With the assistance of immigration lawyers, she was
[normal] eventually
[normal] able to leave the detention centre and was granted refugee status for five years. She 
[normal]brought a claim
[normal] 
[normal]against the UK
[normal]BA
[normal] for 
[normal]unlawful detention and 
[normal]ill-treatment experienced dur
[normal]ing detention. 
[normal]Her claim was settled in September 201 and she was awarded 42,500 in damages. 
[normal]Her 
[normal]detention 
[normal]and ill 
[normal]- 
[normal]treatment has had a 
[normal]permanent impact on her 
[normal]mental 
[normal]health
[normal]. She is suffering from chronic post - traumatic stress disorder.
