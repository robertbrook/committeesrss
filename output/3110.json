"&#xa0;\nSupplementary written evidence from the Federation of Small Businesses&#xa0;\n16\n October 2013\n&#xa0;\nI very much appreciated the opportunity to provide oral evidence on the Consumer Rights Bill on behalf of the Federation of Small Businesses last week.\n&#xa0;\nI had wanted to follow up with you regarding \nan issue \nI raised which wasn’t pursued as a line of questioning, perhaps be\ncause qui\nt\ne\n understandably\n,\n the focus of the Committee was striking a balance between consumers and small businesses rather than small businesses as consumers.\n&#xa0;\nTo elaborate, during the evidence session I explained briefly that the FSB is \ncarrying out \na significant piece of work on small businesses as consumers because micro-businesses in particular, are very often consumers in exactly the same way as individual\ns, \nbut they lack the same level of regulatory\n protections\n in consumer legislation.\n&#xa0;\nOur research project is underway and being led by Professor Amelia Fletcher from the University of East Anglia, the former chief economist from the OFT, looking at how small businesses behave as consumers and how legislators and regulators can help protect them from unfair practice.  Whilst predominately focussing on the regulated markets, such as energy and telecoms, the project \nwill address questions such as: \nTo what extent are suppliers required to provide information to small businesses in an easily accessible form about the products available to them? To what extent is the information provided to small businesses required \nnot \nto be mis\nleading? To what extent are small businesses\n protected from aggressive or otherwise i\nnappropriate sales practices? \nTo what extent are small businesses protected from unfair contract terms?\n &#xa0;\nThe project team is\n currently looking into the role the \nConsumer Rights Bill \ncould play in helping the UK’s smallest businesses gain adequate consumer protection an\nd we would therefore welcome the Committee\n to look into this further.  We have approached \nthe Department \nasking why they have chosen no\nt to class small and micro businesses \nas consumers but\n have not \nyet \nreceived a satisfactory explanation.\n \n&#xa0;\nThe FSB believes consideration should be given as to whether small or at least micro businesses, should be classed as consumers for the purpose of the Bill to ensure the UK’s smallest businesses enjoy the same level of protection as consumers will when they are using goods and services.  &#xa0;We appreciate this is a complex and legally technical\n area but we believe this is an area that should be given though\nt\n to.\n I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this with you further. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nMike CherryNational Policy Chairman, Federation of Small Businesses&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
