"&#xa0;\nNapp Pharmaceuticals – Written evidence&#xa0;&#xa0;NAPP Pharmaceuticals \n&#xa0;\nNAPP Pharmaceuticals is one of a number of privately owned, worldwide, independent associated healthcare companies. NAPP is a leader in the field of pain management and has been committed to furthering the understanding and treatment of pain for over thirty years.\n&#xa0;\nThe UK \ncompany\n has been based at Cambridge Science Park since 1983. The site comprises a fully integrated, ethical, pharmaceuticals business, including manufacturing and commercial activities. NAPP works in analgesics, oncology, respiratory medicine and cardiology. The company employs over 700 people across the UK. At the end of 2010 the company was ranked 15th largest in the UK pharmaceutical industry based on GP prescription sales. For the last 5 years, Napp has been ranked in the top 25 of the Sunday Times 100 best companies to work for in the UK.\n&#xa0;\nThe company fully supports the Government’s efforts to tackle the problem of those who drive while under the influence of illegal and illicitly consumed drugs and therefore welcomes the introduction of the new legislation on drug driving. During the process of the primary legislation, Napp had significant concerns about the potential unintended consequences for patients taking prescribed medication whose driving is unimpaired. Napp appreciated the opportunity to raise these concerns during the debate and with the Department for Transport and the Expert Panel, and, although some of these concerns remain, Napp welcomes the Government’s efforts to protect innocent patients.\n&#xa0;\nDraft Deregulation Bill \nClause 4 Schedule 9 includes provision on the enforcement of transport legislation including in relation to drink and drug driving offences.  Napp has concerns about the wording of two sections of the draft Bill. \n&#xa0;\nParagraph 5 amends the RTA to provide that in addition to a medical practitioner, a registered healthcare professional may make the assessment of the suspect’s condition.  Whilst Napp understands that a qualified doctor might not always be available to make such an assessment, it is alarming that provision is being made to allow anyone registered as a healthcare professional to make such an assessment.  The initial assessments made at the scene of an accident can have ramifications on whether charges are bought forward and/or specimens are taken (should the person be unable to give consent).  \n&#xa0;\nNapp believes that the wording ‘healthcare professional’ is too open-ended, and must be tightened up, allowing only those most qualified to assess whether someone has been driving in an impaired manner and is under the influence of drugs.  This could be a doctor or perhaps a nurse, but the current wording of the draft Bill might allow, for example, a physiotherapist or paramedic to make an assessment for which they do not have the necessary training and experience. \n&#xa0;\nSection 6 of the RTA provides the police with the power to administer one or more of three types of preliminary tests, one of which is an impairment test.  The purpose of this is to assist the police to ascertain whether the driver which they believed to be driving in an impaired manner, has drugs in his / her bloodstream which might have caused the \nimpairment.  It also gives protection to the driver, as a) there could be many reasons why their driving was impaired and b) it could be that the police officer believed the driver was impaired when in fact he/she was not. \n&#xa0;\nHowever, the draft Bill allows for the police officer to arrest the subject with or without a preliminary impairment test, if they consider that they have sufficient evidence of impaired driving.  This removes a basic and fundamental right of the driver to be given the opportunity to submit to a roadside test, which will provide solid evidence on levels of drink and drugs in the driver’s body.  This also gives the driver the opportunity to state a medical defence and inform the police of any prescription drugs he/she might be taking.   If samples are taken at a later date, the results could be distorted.\n&#xa0;\nWithout performing a roadside test on every occasion that the police believe any driver to be impaired, the subjective view of said officer on whether driving was impaired takes on greater importance.  Whilst Napp believes that the vast majority of policemen can correctly identify someone who is driving impaired, their view it is not as definitive as the results of a roadside test.  For those who are stopped and are for example taking prescription medication in line with medical advice, the absence of a roadside test might be the beginning of a long and emotionally exhausting unnecessary legal journey.   Whilst Napp fully supports the role the police play in interpreting the drug driving legislation, drivers must remain protected. \n&#xa0;\nConclusion \nNapp supports the Government’s effort to tackle impaired driving by those who are under the influence of illegal drugs, or who have taken drugs illicitly. However, protection of drivers who might also be patients on pain relieving medication, but are within the levels prescribed by Government, is imperative.  Therefore Napp urges the Scrutiny Committee to amends the two sections of the legislation to tighten up protection for drivers. \n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
