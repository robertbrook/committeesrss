[normal]Skin disorders are amongst the most common long-term conditions in the UK: there are more than 2,000 different diseases.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There is a large number of genetic skin diseases; each one may only affect a small number of people, but taken together they form part of the long term skin disease burden in the UK.
[normal] 
[normal]For sufferers they are a life sentence of misery, physical and cosmetic disability and psychological challenges.

[normal] 20% of children in the UK have eczema,
[normal]children with serious skin conditions

[normal]Some lifelong diseases such as vitiligo
[normal],
[normal] which results in the loss of normal skin colour

[normal] can have a devastating effect on self-esteem for people from b

[normal]It is estimated that several million people 
[normal]in the UK 
[normal]have significant chronic sun damage 
[normal]resulting in 
[normal]~13,000 melanomas and ~800,000 basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers a year.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]People with chronic sun damage 
[normal]suffer increasing numbers of skin cancers as they age 
[normal]–
[normal] 
[normal]the

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In the UK, data from the WHO Global Burden of Diseases study shows that DALYs (Disability Life-Adjusted Years) for skin conditions are as high as those for diabetes, chronic renal disease, gastrointestinal disorders or neonatal abnormalities. The reason is largely because skin disease is 
[normal]so 
[normal]common.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]P
[normal]atients with chronic disease 
[normal]can be 
[normal]affected by skin disease directly
[normal] 
[normal]due to 
[normal]the 
[normal]effects of 
[normal]those diseases
[normal] (
[normal]eg
[normal] diabetes and HIV)
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]P
[normal]eople with other LTCs 
[normal]also 
[normal]get skin problems due to their treatments
[normal]. This is
[normal] 
[normal]especially
[normal] common when treatment includes
[normal] drugs
[normal] such as anti-epileptics
[normal],
[normal] cancer therapies and radiotherapy, or 
[normal]transplants 
[normal]- due to the
[normal] drugs given to prevent transplant rejection
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Increasingly in an ageing population people are 
[normal]on multiple medications: 
[normal]dermatological side-effects 
[normal]are extremely common
[normal],
[normal] ranging from chronic itch
[normal]ing
[normal] and rash
[normal]es,
[normal] to life threatening

[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]P
[normal]atients with chronic psoriasis have increased obesity, hypertension,

[normal]percholestolaemia
[normal], diabetes, heart disease
[normal] (the metabolic syndrome) 
[normal]and mortality

[normal]% of patients with psoriasis develop chronic arthritis. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In the United Kingdom, in excess of 10,400 diagnoses of depression, 7,100 diagnoses of anxiety, and 350 diagnoses of 
[normal]suicidality
[normal] are attributable to psoriasis annually
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]24% of the population consults a GP each year because of a skin complaint. Skin disease is one of the 
[normal]most 
[normal]common reason
[normal]s
[normal] for a new consultation with GPs
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]GPs refer approximately 6.1% of these cases to secondary care and in 2010/11 873,000 such referrals were made in England with 2.9m total outpatient appointments for skin diseases.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]here is a 20% under-provision of Dermatology services
[normal] 
[normal]in the UK: 
[normal]with 
[normal]only 650 Consultants
[normal] 
[normal]in the country
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Despite the above statistics, GPs receive on average no more than six days training in Dermatology during the whole of their time as undergraduate and post-graduate medical students, and only around one in five GP training schemes offer a Dermatology element
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]It is therefore inevitable that many doctors will enter General Practice with limited knowledge and understanding of common skin diseases
[normal] 
[normal]that can
[normal] often
[normal] present significant clinical diagnostic and management problems.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Referrals to Dermatology services have risen as a consequence of increasing population numbers
[normal],
[normal] frequency of 
[normal]skin 
[normal]diseases
[normal],
[normal] improved treatments and changing attitudes to skin conditions.
[normal] 
[normal]This is despite the increased number of community based services following the recommendations of the White Paper 
[normal]‘Our health, our care, our say: a new direction for community services’ (2006).

[normal]2.1
[normal]              
[normal]In the BAD’s document 
[normal]‘Guidance for Commissioning 
[normal]Dermatology
[normal] Services’
[normal] we set out the range and scope of services which would best serve 
[normal]Dermatology
[normal] patients at different levels
[normal],
[normal] including Community Pharmacists and Specialist Nurse
[normal]-
[normal]led clinics supporting patients with self-management, 
[normal]and covering 
[normal]primary and intermediate care to secondary and tertiary services. The BAD supports the provision of a 
[normal]comprehensive 
[normal]mix of services but not the promotion of one type of service over another – there will always be a need for 
[normal]centralised
[normal] 
[normal]hospital
[normal]-
[normal]based services
[normal]. T
[normal]hese continue to be the most cost-effective and safe means of providing direct access to care for patients who are acutely unwell and have complex care needs.
[normal] Increased
[normal] Consultant
[normal]-
[normal]led community services and
[normal] education of primary care doctors and nurses will all help to improve 
[normal]integrated
[normal] care of patients
[normal] through a pyramid of appropriate expertise
[normal],
[normal] so that patients see the right person at the right time
[normal].

[normal]Centres
[normal] 
[normal]are also used in some areas to triage and/or review GP referrals to reduce the number of patients 
[normal]referred to
[normal] secondary care.
[normal] 
[normal]The BAD recommends that GP referrals are always triaged by a

[normal]onsultant 
[normal]Dermatologist
[normal] with 
[normal]GPwSI
[normal] and 
[normal]Dermatology
[normal] nurse support
[normal],
[normal] and that referral management services should only be set up after consultation with all stakeholders, including
[normal] the public and 
[normal]those in secondary care
[normal]. 
[normal]W
[normal]ithout engagement at all levels, referral management services may introduce an additional tier 
[normal]to accessing 
[normal]care, reduce patient choice and quality of care
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]and
[normal] worse still, 
[normal]destabilise
[normal] 
[normal]local NHS hospital
[normal] services

[normal]s
[normal] in order to provide intermediate levels of care in the community.
[normal] 
[normal]However, the objective 
[normal]of such 
[normal]decommissioning – to bring about improvements in service provision 
[normal]- 
[normal]has not been 
[normal]realised
[normal].
[normal] Instead
[normal], there are 
[normal]increased
[normal] referrals to both community and 
[normal]hospital 
[normal]services, rather than reduced referrals to the 
[normal]hospital 
[normal]setting.

[normal]his happen
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]even when these services are provided by local clinicians under a 
[normal]Limited Liability Partnership
[normal]. In the majority of cases where this has happened the cost of care remains the same per head of patients as the hospital service.
[normal] 
[normal]This cost does not, though, factor in the additional costs for patient care for those 
[normal]‘
[normal]lost

[normal] on the referral 
[normal]pathway 
[normal]between their GP and the community, before getting to secondary care.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4
[normal]              
[normal]Although moving care closer to home has been a policy ambition for some time, referral rates to both community and secondary care services have continued to rise since its inception, and there are worrying signs that primary care is buckling under the current pressures of demand
[normal].

[normal] young and old, and over time
[normal], o
[normal]ne of the reasons why diabetes is

[normal]DALY 
[normal]numbers
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2
[normal]              
[normal]The skin cancer epidemic gathers pace. The vast majority of skin cancer is due to chronic photo
[normal]-
[normal]damag
[normal]e
[normal] as a result of increased recreational exposure 
[normal]and this
[normal] shows 
[normal]no signs of diminishing
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Many patients will have several episodes
[normal] of skin cancer
[normal] 
[normal]and pre-cancer 
[normal]as they get older. There are about 
[normal]~
[normal]1
[normal]3

[normal]              
[normal]With increasing population growth and increasing longevity it is important to invest in 
[normal]Dermatology
[normal] services
[normal], and training in

[normal],
[normal] so that the burden of chronic skin disease can be better managed with better outcomes for all patients

[normal],
[normal] and particularly with skin conditions

[normal] disease contributes hugely to LTCs in the UK; 
[normal]m
[normal]illions of people have dermatological LTCs
[normal] such as
[normal] 
[normal]e
[normal]czema, psoriasis, acne
[normal], 
[normal]vitiligo
[normal] and
[normal] occupational skin disease.
[normal] 
[normal]Additionally, 
[normal]there is a 
[normal]grow
[normal]ing sector of the ageing population with chronic
[normal] sun-damage
[normal] and the serial skin cancers that ensue
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Many 
[normal]other primarily non-dermatologica
[normal]l LTCs create significant dermatological needs, 
[normal]due to the disease itself or to its treatment with drugs and their consequences and side effects
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Some dermatological LTCs, especially psoriasis, are associated with significant co-morbidity – the metabolic syndrome
[normal] and arthritis
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]P
[normal]rovision of 
[normal]the 
[normal]type of care 
[normal]affected people

[normal]and of variable quality, i
[normal]n terms of manpower and
