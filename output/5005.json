"&#xa0;\nWRITTEN EVIDENCE SUBMITTED BY HAND IN HAND: CENTER FOR JEWISH-ARAB EDUCATION IN ISRAEL (HIH)&#xa0;\nSUMMARY &#xa0;\nHand in Hand’s Mission\n \n1. \nThe mission of Hand in Hand: The Center for Jewish-Arab Education in Israel (HIH) is to create a strong and inclusive shared society in Israel by (1) enabling Jewish and Arab children to study together in bilingual schools with a multicultural educational model that teaches respect and tolerance, and (2) developing community leadership and a range of community building events for Jewish and Arab adults which creates a social movement beyond the walls of the school.  Starting in 1998 with two schools and 50 children, HIH in 2013-14 has grown to five bilingual schools (Jerusalem, Galilee, Wadi Ara, Haifa, and Jaffa) and 1,080 Jewish and Arab students in grades K-12. Around each school HIH is developing a framework of shared community events to build an integrated and inclusive community. This is a singular accomplishment in a society that generally finds Arabs and Jews living apart, studying in separate institutions, and having minimal contact\n, a situation which fosters mistrust, reinforces stereotypes, and perpetuates conflict between the two groups.\n \n&#xa0;\nConflict \nresolution requires daily interaction\n2. \nResolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will require political creativity and resolve, but it cannot succeed without both sides \nrecognizing the legitimacy of the other nation and the other’s \nnarrative. HIH fo\ncuses its efforts on the Jewish and Arab citizens of Israel (the latter often considering themselves Palestinian citizens as well).  The creation of an inclusive society between Jews and Arabs living within Israel’s current borders\n is contingent upon both \nsides legitimating the other.  This process of mutual \nrecognition will \nimprove \nrelations and understanding between Jews and Arabs in Israel\n, and illustrate the viability of shared living.  This is applicable \nnot only \nto Jews and Arabs in Israel but \nto \nIsraelis and Palestini\na\nns\n on both sides of the conflict as well.  \n&#xa0;\n3. \nBringing the \nJewish and Arab \npopulations together periodically for coexistence encounters and dialogue has proven to be insufficient. Daily contact starting in pre-kindergarten, in a sa\nfe environment where ongoing relationships and friendships can be developed is crucial. Providing the tools to deal with differences in per\ns\npectives is vital.\n \nHand in Hand believes that the \ndaily\n, positive\n \nand meaningful \ninteraction\n \nof its \nJewish and \nA\nrab\n students\n, teachers, \nand \nparents \ntaking place in \nits bilingual schools\n,\n and\n \nthe connections \nand social awareness \nbeing developed \nbetween community members \nas a \nresult\n \nof\n \ncommunity \nbuilding events\n,\n \nwill create \nshared social and civic frameworks between Jews and\n Arabs\n that\n \nwill \nalter Israeli society\n. \n&#xa0;\n4\n. \nHIH bilingual schools are amongst the only places in Israel where Jews and Arabs engage \non a daily basis\n in an environment of mutual respect, with Hebrew and Arabic-speaking teachers, a shared calendar to celebrate the holidays of each culture, as well as a multicultural curriculum. \nO\nur students excel academically, \nwinning competitions in science and spelli\nng bees, and achieving above average scores on the matriculation exams.\n HIH’s bilingual multicultural educational model also \nfosters understanding and friendship while breaking down barriers between Arab and Jewish youth, and promotes civic responsibility \nin its students. \n&#xa0;\nSpecial Elements in HIH Schools\n5\n. \nAlthough \nHand in Hand schools \nare\n \napproved, supervised and supported by the \nMinistry of Education, \nHand in Hand \nmust raise\n \nan \nadditional \n$\n2.7\n million\n \nin order to add\n special elements to promote the bilingual education and social values that are its reason for being:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe events that happened in Gaza and the south in 2008, was the first time that I personally had to deal with a politically sensitive issue as a mature person... Going to school that same day was difficult, but …the teachers had all kinds of activities pre\npared to help us discuss our feelings and thoughts, and I felt my opinions were heard and respected by all students. This experience was important to me, because it tested the true values of the school, and I realized that things happen and they might be t\nough, but we are equipped with the best tools to handle them, by listening and respecting. I think this has really shown me that we don’t live in a bubble where everything is perfect, we live in the real world, where horrible things happen sometimes, but w\ne learn how to handle them in the best way. \n&#xa0;\nRole of HIH’s Education Department\n6\n. \nAchieving academic excellence and promoting civic responsibility at HIH schools requires properly trained staff \nwho\n can \nprovide \ncivic and \npedagogical leadership, \nutilize \nHIH’s unique co-teaching model and can implement multicultural curricula which teach tolerance and civic responsibility.\n \nTo this end, HIH has created an Education Department\n.\n \nHIH teachers\n, both veteran and new,\n \nreceive \nspecial pedagogic training\n \nso that they are able to \nwork \nas equals \nwith\nin\n the co-teaching model, \nlearn to integrate\n both the core and supplementary curricula i\nnto their teaching, and \nare equipped to\n manage\n the issues of culture and difference that arise.  \nThis training \ninvolves both working closely with \nindividual \nstaff in particula\nr\n schools\n,\n as well as\n bringing the educational staff from all \nof \nHIH’s \ncountry-wide network of \nschools together for an intensive three-day conference \nin order \nto\n share ideas, problem solve, and learn from each other’s experiences\n.\n&#xa0;\n \nS\nince HIH’s Jewish and Arab teachers are essentially civic leaders who are training the next generation, it is vital that the teaching staff from \nall\n five HIH bilingual schools strategize together as to the best practices for achieving their goals.\n \n&#xa0;\n7\n. \nIn addition to training and supervising the educational staff, the Education Department \ndevelops the multicultural supplementary curricula used by HIH schools such as the Religious Cultural Heritage Curriculum which enables students from all three faiths o\nf\n \n[object Object]\n and \na\nn\n \nH\nistory \nC\nurriculum that includes narratives of both populations\n. \nThe Education Department \nhas also developed a \nPrincipals’ Forum\n, \nan institutional framework for bringing together \nprincipals, \nvice-principals \nand \nsenior staff from all of \nthe\n bilingual schools to learn from each other, share \nproblems \nand insights, and develop concepts and methodologies together in the field of bilingual\n,\n \nmulticultural \neducation. \n&#xa0;\nRole of Community\n Activities Program\n8\n. \nIn order to widen its impact \nbeyond the school setting\n, HIH is \nalso designing and implementing community building events in the five locations in which it currently has schools. The \ngoals of this Shared Communities Program are: to establish a wide range of Jewish-Arab community activities, from sports and culture to dialogue, study and responding to discriminatory events, and open the community activity to all who are interested.  In new locations the communities play a central role in helping open new schools. \n9\n. \nAs of March 2012 HIH had 3 bilingual schools in Jerusalem, Wadi Ara, and the Galilee. Thanks to three-year core funding from the United States gover\nnment’s U.S. Agency for International Development and with matching funds, \nHIH\n \nlaunched its\n Shared Community Project\n. The goal of this project is \nto establish community leadership and structures\n, and develop \na range of \nvibrant \ncommunity\n \nactivities (from sports, culture, family activities and excursions, to dialogue groups, language study, and responding to \ndiscriminatory\n \nevents)\n \nt\nhat will\n create \na civic infrastructure for social inclusion and civic equality \nbeyond the wa\nlls of the school\n.  \n&#xa0;\n10\n. \nIn March 2012 \nHIH selected Jaffa and Haifa as its two new communities\n.\n \nThe Shared Community Project \nstaff \ndevelop\ned\n local leadership\n and together \nthey \ndesign\ned\n activities to fit the needs and interests of the Jewish and Arab populations\n in these communities\n. Parents \nand children \nparticipated in cultural events, holiday celebrations, \nand community gardening\n; \nadults \nenrolled in Arab and Hebrew language classes\n, pa\nrticipated in dialogue sessions, and played on \nintegrated \nbasketball teams\n. They got to know one another and formed friendships. As a result of these interactions, the Jaffa and Haifa communities strengthened the bonds between Jews and Arabs, enabling them\n to cooperate and open a bilingual pre-kindergarten in each of their \ncommunities in September 2013 with an equal number of Jewish and Arab children\n enrolled and with hundreds on waiting lists\n.\n1\n1\n. \nThe community organizers will continue to develop and run \nlocal activities\n for the more veteran communities to insure strong parental involvement, a growing student body\n,\n and joint Jewish and Arab communal life. They will \nhelp insure that the new bilingual schools in Jaffa and Haifa \ncontinue to grow with \nanother \ngrade each year, \nand will continue to develop and maintain relationships with the Municipality and the Ministry of Education.\n They will also help start new communities and new schools.\n&#xa0;\nCountry-Wide \nCommunity \nEvent\n1\n2\n. \nCommunity \no\nrganizers are also responsible \nfor \norganiz\ning\n an annual event\n,\n bringing together the Hand in Hand communities from all around the country.  \nHIH\n piloted a country-wide \nevent \naround Ramadan \nfor the first time in July 20\n13 \nand it was a huge success. HIH\n expected 250 people\n, but \nclosed registration with 650 \nArabs and Jews\n \ncom\ning from all over the country. \nThe program included a public discussion with a Rabbi, a Sheikh and a Priest about the notion of fasting and forgiving in the three religions as well as musical performances. Bringing community leaders together for the planning of such an event empowers th\nem as they realize that they are part of something much bigger than their own community. They are able \nto share stories of success and failure and learn from each other’s experiences. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPublicizing HIH’s Success\nes\n1\n3\n. \nWhile our bi\nlingual schools and shared communities demonstrate that it is possible for Jews and Arabs to peacefully coexist, interact, and become friends, the experience of cooperation that we have demonstrated will have a limited impact if it remains known only to th\nose who have personally experienced it. Therefore, HIH has hired an \nOrganizational Journalist\n to join the team, and help publicize our story of an inclusive society to as wide an audience as possible\n in Hebrew, English and Arabic\n.  HIH’s “doing” in the bil\ningual schools and in the shared communities will inform the telling\n, which will illustrate the viability of inclusion, shared society and equality.  \nThis will counter \nthe \n feelings\n of helplessness and despair that exists in no small part because of the media’s highlighting negative stories. Our stories \nthat appear in radio segments, television reports, in the Israeli and international press, \nand on Facebook \nhttps://www.facebook.com/HandinHandil\n \nprovide a powerful message that a different reality is possible \nin \nIsrael\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nVision for the Future\n1\n4\n. \nOver the next ten years, Hand in Hand aims to create a network of 10-15 integrated bilingual schools, supported and enhanced by active communities, altogether involving \nsome \n20,000 \nIsraeli citizens.  These visibly integrated shared communities wi\nll not only help HIH schools succeed and expand, but will also show the broader public that the experience of social inclusion and mutual respect is viable not only for students but also for all citizens.  \nIsrael \ncan be a \ndiverse\n \ndemocratic s\ntate where Jews and Arabs live together peacefully. \n&#xa0;\nRequest for Funding\n1\n5\n. \nTo accomplish its goals HIH must locate additional sources of funding. While it has submitted requests to the British Embassy, it has not been awarded funding\n in recent years. HIH \nasks that a larger portion of \nUK government \nfunds be granted to organizations like HIH which have succeeded \nthrough its bilingual, multicultural schools and \ncommunity-oriented \nactivities\n \nin \nbringing together Jews and Arabs on a daily \nbasis, improving the relationships between them,\n and developing trust and respect for one another.\n \nIn this way we will build a strong civil society in Israel\n \nthat \nembodies\n \nthe values of inclusiveness and equality – values that were the foundation of the St\nate of Israel.
