default19.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe problem:
default 
defaultCUH wanted to reduce the length of stay (LOS) of patients to improve the patient throughput and experience, and reduce cost.
default 
defaultThis included
default prevent
defaulting
default unnecessary delays to the discharge of patients with on-going care needs. A key challenge to achieving this was insufficient collaboration between the Trust and adult social care providers. 
default19.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe solution
default: Accenture worked with CUH on a wide range of measures but the two most relevant for the Committee are the introduction of 
defaultcase managementdefault and the set-up of a 
defaultsingle point of accessdefault to coordinate all discharge activities across several health and care providers.
default 
default19.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe outcome
default: Implementation of this integrated care model reduced section 5 admissions by 3 days, led to LOS reduction of 1 day in surgery for patients with no on-going care needs and reduced outliers by 40%.
default 
defaultOverall the benefit of case management led to reduction of 47,000 bed days over the course of one year, equating to around £5.5m of cost savings.
default 
defaultThere were also significant improvements in patient experience, as well as in the satisfaction levels of healthcare staff.

default 
defaultThe problem:
default Research in the US found that 
defaultunmanaged diabetes costs approximately 21% more than managed diabetes, in large part due to the higher levels of inpatient treatment. 
default20.2
default 
defaultThe solution:
default Accenture worked with the 
defaulthospital 
defaultto implement a Patient Navigation Program (PNP). The PNP used non-medical ‘lay’ staff in the community to help clinical staff to ensure chronically ill patients received continuous support 
defaultoutside
default the hospital setting. Patients were profiled and segmented and personalised interventions developed to target the particular needs of each group.
default20.3
default 
defaultThe Outcome:
default Patients are more compliant with their care plans after enrolment in the program, contributing to a de
defaultcrease in no-show/cancellation. 
defaultWhilst the annual cost to patients for unmanaged diabetes is $14,210, this was reduced to $11,744 after the introduction of the patient navigators.
