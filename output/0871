[normal]19.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The problem:
[normal] 
[normal]CUH wanted to reduce the length of stay (LOS) of patients to improve the patient throughput and experience, and reduce cost.
[normal] 
[normal]This included
[normal] prevent
[normal]ing
[normal] unnecessary delays to the discharge of patients with on-going care needs. A key challenge to achieving this was insufficient collaboration between the Trust and adult social care providers. 
[normal]19.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The solution
[normal]: Accenture worked with CUH on a wide range of measures but the two most relevant for the Committee are the introduction of 
[normal]case management[bold] and the set-up of a 
[normal]single point of access[bold] to coordinate all discharge activities across several health and care providers.
[normal] 
[normal]19.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The outcome
[normal]: Implementation of this integrated care model reduced section 5 admissions by 3 days, led to LOS reduction of 1 day in surgery for patients with no on-going care needs and reduced outliers by 40%.
[normal] 
[normal]Overall the benefit of case management led to reduction of 47,000 bed days over the course of one year, equating to around £5.5m of cost savings.
[normal] 
[normal]There were also significant improvements in patient experience, as well as in the satisfaction levels of healthcare staff.

[normal]Community-based patient navigators supporting chronically ill diabetes patients in the community[bold] [bold]20.1
[normal] 
[normal]The problem:
[normal] Research in the US found that 
[normal]unmanaged diabetes costs approximately 21% more than managed diabetes, in large part due to the higher levels of inpatient treatment. 
[normal]20.2
[normal] 
[normal]The solution:
[normal] Accenture worked with the 
[normal]hospital 
[normal]to implement a Patient Navigation Program (PNP). The PNP used non-medical ‘lay’ staff in the community to help clinical staff to ensure chronically ill patients received continuous support 
[normal]outside
[normal] the hospital setting. Patients were profiled and segmented and personalised interventions developed to target the particular needs of each group.
[normal]20.3
[normal] 
[normal]The Outcome:
[normal] Patients are more compliant with their care plans after enrolment in the program, contributing to a de
[normal]crease in no-show/cancellation. 
[normal]Whilst the annual cost to patients for unmanaged diabetes is $14,210, this was reduced to $11,744 after the introduction of the patient navigators. 
[normal]Integration across different actors needs to be complemented with big data, analytics[bold], technology[bold] and changing services[bold]&#xa0;
