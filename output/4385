defaultExecutive Summary
default1.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is a critical moment for disability inclusion in development. The post-2015 process offers the opportunity to build a shared vision of development based on the principle that no intervention should be judged successful if it does not include and empower disabled women, men, girls and boys of all ages and ethnicities – and to make a reality of that vision by ensuring that disability is explicitly included as a core issue within the post-2015 global development framework.
default&#xa0;
default1.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe congratulate the 
defaultUK
default government for playing a crucial role in getting disability on the post-2015 agenda, and we call on DFID to seize the moment, and to lead the way in disability inclusion. As a major 
defaultactor
default in global development, DFID has the responsibility and the potential to take a leadership role in this area
default&#xa0;
default1.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUK INGOs represented by DDG are united in our vision of what needs to be done, drawing on a broad range of experience and evidence of what works, and making specific recommendations for action to achieve disability inclusion in all aspects of DFID’s work.
default&#xa0;
default1.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe call on DFID to make a public, 
defaulthigh level commitmentdefault to include disabled people equitably in its work. In order to fulfill this commitment, we recommend the following action:
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBuild disability in to DFID’s strategic frameworks
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAppoint a Disability Champion
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDevelop planning and accountability systems which promote disability inclusion
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultInvest in learning and evidence
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPromote the voice and participation of disabled people
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Bond Disability and Development Group (DDG) brings together UK-based mainstream and disability-specific 
defaultorganisations
default to ensure that disabled people’s
default concerns are addressed at the highest level. The member 
defaultorganisations
default of DDG represent a large body of experience based on direct work with disabled people and the disability movement in developing countries, as well as advocacy and policy engagement with service providers and policymakers. 
defaultDDG is therefore able to draw on a broad and deep understanding of the barriers faced by disabled people of all ages, the links between disability and poverty, and the importance of including disability issues within the development process. 
default&#xa0;
default2.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis submission represents a synthesis of the key messages emerging from DDG member 
defaultorganisations’
default individual submissions to the IDSC, and we indicate where these can be referenced for greater detail on specific issues.  
default3.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is a growing understanding that development interventions will fail to reach the poorest unless disability issues and disabled people are included: Disability is increasingly 
defaultrecognised
default as a core development issue, not just because disabled people make up 15% of all populations, but because of the close links between disability, poverty, and exclusion (WHO/World Bank 2011, 
defaultMitra
default et al 2012), and evidence that the exclusion of disabled people from 
defaultlabour
default markets has a negative impact on economies in poorer countries (
defaultBuckup
default, ILO Report 2009).
default&#xa0;
default3.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDisability needs to be understood primarily as a social and human rights issue: It is the combination of discrimination with social and environmental barriers which excludes and 
defaultmarginalises
default disabled people, and which traps a disproportionate number in poverty (WHO/World Bank 2011). 
default&#xa0;
default3.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDisabled people do not represent a homogenous group – disability is one of many intersecting factors (including age, gender, ethnicity etc.)  which combine to intensify social inequalities and 
defaultmarginalisation
default. And disability also interacts with other issues to influence development outcomes; for example, conflict and violence can create disability, while disability increases vulnerability in such contexts (HI submission).
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDisability inclusion is about improving the quality rather than the quantity of UK aid and development 
defaultprogrammes
default: An investment in disability inclusion represents value for money. For disability inclusion to be effective, political commitment needs to be supported with an investment of resources: 
defaultAusAID
default spent £9.5m on disability in 2012/13 and has dedicated a further £10.6m for 2013/14. Mainstreaming disability from the start of a 
defaultprogramme
default represents the best value for money e.g. by incorporating inclusive design in new infrastructure, and USAID has found that most modifications to ensure the inclusion of disabled people in mainstream projects can often be implemented without additional costs (USAID website 1.12.13.). 
default4.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDisability is finally emerging as a core issue within the international development debate, as reflected in the recent High Level Panel and Secretary General’s reports on the post-2015 Development Framework. These documents call for a transformative shift which ‘leaves no one behind’, they highlight the importance of disaggregating indicators to support this, and state that ‘no target should be considered met unless met for all social groups, including people with disabilities’.
default&#xa0;
default4.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, these gains will not be secured until the final framework is agreed - continued pressure and vigilance will be needed to ensure that disability inclusion remains explicit and does not get lost or subsumed into general statements about ‘
defaultmarginalised
default groups’ at the last moment. 
default&#xa0;
default5.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK government has a duty in international law, under Article 32 of the UNCRPD, to ensure that all international cooperation including development 
defaultprogrammes
default, is ‘inclusive of and accessible to persons with disabilities.’
default&#xa0;
default5.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDFID has a good track record on its analysis of the importance of disability inclusion and was one of the first bilateral agencies to 
defaultrecognise
default the central importance of disability to development in its 2000 paper on Disability, Poverty and Development. This was followed in 2007 with the How to Note on Working on Disability in Country 
defaultProgrammes
default and various guidance notes on disability related issues. However this analysis and guidance is not well known within DFID, and has not translated into systematic inclusion practice across all 
defaultprogrammes
default. 
default&#xa0;
default5.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is currently no DFID policy or strategy on disability, and there is no obligation for DFID 
defaultprogrammes
default to demonstrate or monitor the inclusion of disabled people in their work, e.g. through the disaggregation of data by disability. As a result we do not even know whether disabled people benefit equitably from DFID’s aid and development 
defaultprogrammes
default. However, DDG members’ experience and evidence of the barriers which exclude disabled people from all areas of life would suggest that, without targeted action to ensure inclusion, it is most probable that disabled people are not currently benefitting equitably within mainstream 
defaultprogrammes
default. We 
defaultdo
default know that disability is not adequately reflected within strategic documents in other areas, such as the Strategic Vision for Women and Girls, and DFID’s work also lacks a focus on different needs across the life course and this has implications for disabled people’s inclusion, given the links between disability and ageing. 
default&#xa0;
default5.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDFID and UK parliamentarians have played a crucially important role in getting disability on the post-2015 agenda, and key individuals within DFID are currently championing disability inclusion, leading to positive initiatives such as the recent announcement that all schools built with DFID funding will be required to be physically accessible, including WASH services, and the commitment to work with partners globally to improve data and evidence. However, the institutional structures and systems are not in place to ensure that this current interest is embedded at all levels or sustained as individuals move on. 
default&#xa0;
default6.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIndividual submissions are being made from DDG members and other allied UK INGOs, and these represent a rich source of evidence and experience relating to different aspects of disability inclusion in development, as 
defaultsummarised
default below. Each of these submissions makes recommendations relating to specific issues, and all have contributed to, and endorse, the overarching recommendations in this paper.

default the importance of tackling the discrimination faced by disabled

defaultLeonard Cheshire Disability
default (LCD)’s experience demonstrates the value of initiatives which make 
defaultyoung disabled peopledefault agents of their own change within development 
defaultprogrammes
default. The value of joined-up, holistic approaches to 
defaultearly childhood developmentdefault is illustrated by 
defaultSense
default, while approaches which tackle 
defaultviolencedefault against disabled children are demonstrated by 
defaultPlan UK
default.  Special attention is needed to achieve the inclusion of children with
default intellectual disabilities defaultor with
default severe or complex disabilities: defaultSense International 
defaultunderlines the importance of working with stakeholders to develop specialist knowledge on developing communication, social, mobility and practical skills.
default&#xa0;
default6.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe importance of access to 
defaulteducation defaultwhich responds to the needs of disabled children is crucial: Submissions from 
defaultPlan UK, 
defaultAbleChildAfrica
default, Global Campaign for Education (GCE)/ RESULTS UK, and Handicap International (HI) 
defaultprovide insights into this challenge, recognizing DFID’s efforts in this area, and 
defaultanalysing
default why these good intentions are not always translated into good practice on the ground. 
default&#xa0;
default6.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default The double and sometimes triple discrimination faced by 
defaultdisabled women/ older women and girlsdefault is evidenced in the 
defaultGADN Gender and Disability Working Group’s submission
default, which finds that gender focused policies and 
defaultprogrammes
default often neglect the disability dimension, thereby further 
defaultmarginalising
default disabled women and girls.

defaultWaterAid
default highlights how lack of accessible 
defaultWASHdefault (water, sanitation and hygiene) can impact on disabled people, particularly disabled women and girls for whom accessing WASH facilities can present additional challenges and vulnerability, and provides evidence of effective, low cost approaches to ensuring that disabled people are included in WASH 
defaultprogrammes
default.

defaultemphasises
default the importance of disabled people’s

defaultSense International
default and 
defaultThe Leprosy Mission England &amp; Wales
default highlight the value of initiatives which tackle 
defaultsocial stigma defaultin tackling the isolation and exclusion of disabled people, particularly the most excluded (albinism, 
defaultdeafblind
default, intellectual disability etc.), including through participation in mainstream 
defaultprogrammes
default which builds understanding between disabled and non-disabled people. 
default&#xa0;

defaultMotivation’s
default work evidences the importance of adherence to international guidelines on 
defaultassistive devicesdefault in enabling disabled people to access services (health and education) and to participate in social and economic activities: Without inputs which support mobility and communication, disabled people are unable to benefit equitably from development interventions and remain ‘left behind’.
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default The 
defaultimportance of

default&#xa0;
default– is reflected in 
defaultCBM’

default&#xa0;
default6.12.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRecent research finds that only 1% of international humanitarian aid is dedicated to disabled or older people, while evidence from the crisis in Syria shows that the barriers faced by disabled and older people often mean that they are effectively excluded from 
defaulthumanitarian responsesdefault (
defaultHI/HAI)
default. 
defaultHI
default 
defaultrecognises
default the 
defaultsteps taken by DFID’s humanitarian team to improve age/disability inclusion (e.g. included in 2011 Humanitarian Policy) but calls for this to be consolidated through more systematic approaches.

default6.13.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe importance and challenges of generating the 
defaultdata and evidencedefault on which effective 
defaultprogrammes
default must be based is demonstrated through submissions from the 
defaultInternational Centre for Evidence in
default&#xa0;
default Disability (ICED)/ London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM
default).
default7.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe collective evidence and recommendations put forward by INGOs working on diverse but related issues highlight the following key approaches to effective disability inclusion: 
default&#xa0;
default7.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultStrategic approaches to ensure sustainabilitydefault: Disability inclusion needs to be built in to the culture and systems of mainstream 
defaultorganisations
default at all levels. The ‘Development for All’ strategy in 
defaultAusAid
default, for example, has been effective in achieving good practice and positive impact for disabled people (Development for All Strategy Mid-Term Review 2012)
default 
default&#xa0;
default7.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTwin-track approaches:default Efforts to ensure that mainstream development is 
defaultdisability-inclusivedefault (e.g. education 
defaultprogrammes
default that include disabled boys and girls) need to be supported by 
defaultdisability-specificdefault inputs (e.g. accessible schools/ outreach with disabled children and families). 
default&#xa0;
default7.4.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLocate disability within the equity debatedefault: Disability must be understood in the context of multiple and intersecting factors which contribute to exclusion and disadvantage. We need to ensure that disability is embedded, but not overlooked, within the wider equity discourse.
default&#xa0;default7.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultParticipation of disabled people: defaultPolicy and 
defaultprogramme
default development must draw on the lived experience of disabled people and promote their participation as agents of change. 
default&#xa0;default7.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultReasonable accommodation/ Positive Action:default Ensuring accessibility of mainstream 
defaultprogrammes
default e.g. through inclusive design and modifications, assistive inputs, and removal of physical, communication and attitudinal barriers. Breaking negative cycles of exclusion and discrimination by creating opportunities for disabled people to participate in the workforce. 
default&#xa0;default7.7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEvidence based programming: defaultDisaggregation of data by disability alongside other factors (gender, age, ethnicity, geographic location); qualitative and quantitative evidence on exclusion/barriers to inclusion; learning from what works; and listening to the voices of disabled people through all these processes.
default&#xa0;default7.8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAccess to specialist skills and knowledge:default 
defaultProgramme
default staff and other stakeholders need access to advice, peer support and learning, information and resources on inclusive approaches. 
default&#xa0;
default8.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSeize the moment and reclaim a leading role:default As one of the world’s largest and most influential development actors, the UK and DFID should
default aim to excel and provide leadership defaulton all core humanitarian and development issues – including disability. It must do this by developing and demonstrating
default good practice, within sustainable systems and structures defaultwhich adhere to international law and guidelines on disability, ageing, gender, children and other related issues, and make a reality of the ‘leave no one behind’ agenda. 
default&#xa0;
default8.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMake a commitment to disability inclusion at the highest level:default In order to support the explicit inclusion of disability issues in the post-2015 framework, and to ensure that this is not lost at the 11
defaultth
default hour, DFID should maintain the momentum by making 
defaulta public pledge to include disabled people equitablydefault in its work. We recommend that this pledge is made during 2014, in order to 
defaultmaximise
default the potential for influencing the post-2015 framework to be explicitly inclusive of disability. The pledge should be realistic, specific, phased and 
defaulttimebound
default (e.g. begin by achieving inclusion in one or more bilateral aid 
defaultprogramme
default or sector by 2016), and supported by the following action to ensure it is achieved:
default&#xa0;
default8.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBuild disability in to DFID’s strategic frameworksdefault:  Develop a 
defaultStrategic Vision for Disabled Peopledefault and a 
defaultDisability Theory of Changedefault, drawing on experience from existing approaches to gender within DFID’s work. These instruments should reflect the intersecting nature of diverse factors which contribute to the exclusion of disabled people of all ages, but they must also identify the specific measures needed to ensure disabled people are included. In order to 
defaultmaximise
default the impact of this strategic vision and TOC, we call for DFID to develop an overarching 
defaultEquity and Inclusion Strategydefault which brings together the different factors which impact on equity, such as disability, age, gender etc. This approach to equity and inclusion should be reflected through 
defaultrevisions to DFID’s Business Plandefault. 
default&#xa0;
default8.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAppoint a Disability Champion:default The practical application of the above strategic frameworks will have greatest impact if it is driven forward by key individuals. We recommend the appointment of a 
defaultDisabilitydefault Champion defaultat senior level (this post in USAID is appointed by the president), linked to identified ‘
defaultlead’ staff in country officesdefault. These posts, which need not be new appointments, will require training, guidance and resources to fulfil their role. In order 
defaultto provide advice on disability inclusion, 
defaultSocial Development Advisorsdefault must have sufficient training and technical background, including knowledge of the disability sector and key 
defaultorganisations
default for referral. 
default&#xa0;
default8.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDevelop planning and accountability systems which promote disability inclusion:default Specific changes need to be made to the processes for approving and reporting on funding for DFID country 
defaultprogrammes
default, humanitarian response, and CSO partners. This should include a requirement to 
defaultdisaggregate datadefault (by disability, age gender and other factors), and mechanisms to ensure disability is included at the planning stage (e.g. similar to the 2010 Bilateral Aid Review which asked country offices to state how their interventions would impact on women and girls). 
default&#xa0;
default8.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultInvest in learning and evidence:default 
defaultDFID should exercise political leadership and invest resources in developing work with bilateral/ multilateral 
defaultorganisations
default and CSOs to improve the generation and uptake of: 
defaultdisability datadefault; 
defaultqualitative and defaultquantitiativedefault evidencedefault on the barriers to inclusion; and evidence of effective approaches to inclusion. All of these initiatives should be based on the 
defaultlived experiencedefault of disabled people, promoting their voice and participation in learning and policy development processes.
default&#xa0;default8.7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPromote the voice and participation of disabled people:default Initiatives are needed to promote the active participation of disabled stakeholders in planning, implementation and accountability processes at all levels.  DFID should aim to model good practice in this area e.g. through inclusive design, accessible information and systems, and positive action to 
defaultbring more disabled peopledefault of all ages and of different gender into 
defaultDFID's workforcedefault in delivery and 
defaultdecisionmaking
default roles. We recommend that DFID starts this process by including disabled people in developing the Strategic Vision for Disabled People/ Disability TOC.
