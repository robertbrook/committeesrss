[[[ How can local authorities access the skills, expertise and capabilities to implement effective procurement strategies, including value for money and social and economic objectives? More specifically, does local government have sufficient understanding of its procurement expenditure and the markets for goods and services to deliver quality procurement strategies-locally and regionally.

[[[ Is local authority procurement fully transparent, audited effectively and does it provide appropriate mechanisms for redress? Specifically, are the arrangements for securing the accountability of procured services and goods to local authorities and local residents adequate and effective? More specifically, to what extent are local authorities able to provide assurance to central government that value for money (in the broadest sense of the term) is delivered?]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;As such, they play a vital role in examining local decision making.  Both members and officers will also have regard to a series of agreed organisational policy documents, including a set of financial regulations, standing orders and scheme of delegation.   These set out clear expectations of behaviour and the decision making process in order to deliver the appropriate level of assurance.  In summary, local government benefits from a clear and embedded governance framework.  There exist a number of checks and balances at the local level to ensure that decisions taken within the local authority comply with expectations of regularity, propriety and value for money. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;London Councils and the London Procurement Strategy Board would be happy to provide further clarification on any of the information contained within this submission.&#xa0;September 2013
