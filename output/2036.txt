[[[Rocking the BOAT – Written evidence]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Amendments to The Draft Deregulation Bill&#xa0;Rocking the BOAT is a small local campaigning group formed following a public enquiry in February 2010 in which a little local lane known as Chertpit Lane, from the village of Great Longstone, Derbyshire was classified as a Byway Open To All Traffic or BOAT. The inspector at the time gave very little weight, if any to local public opinion, which was large over 90 residents attended the enquiry and the decision was based on historical evidence from ancient maps dating back 1650 and implied use of horse and carriage. Appeals to Derbyshire county council highways authority were made to implement a traffic regulation order without success, rocking the BOAT submitted a request in February 2012 for a traffic regulation order to the Peak District National Park Authority, the PDNPA are currently going through the public consultation process  &#xa0; Little or no credence was given to the current use of the lane by other soft user groups, walkers, runners, cyclists, horse riders, local education establishments, Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme and families and the dangers of making a small rural green track into a BOAT,  allowing legal use of the lane for recreational mechanical propelled vehicles and the loss of amenity and safety issues which come with it .&#xa0;Chertpit Lane is a 1 mile long narrow (2m at narrowest) unsealed limestone lane with limestone dry stone walls either side the rout of the lane from Dale Farm a livery  rises to give extensive views of the peak district,  with access to Longstone Edge. The effect of the implementation of a BOAT on this local lane is a tragic loss of amenity to the local community, with the increased use of the lane by trail bikes, 4x4’s and quad bikes. This has had a dramatic affect on use by other soft user groups with usage being greatly reduced.&#xa0;Since the opening of Chertpit Lane as a BOAT Derbyshire Highways Authority have seen it necessary to carry out repairs to the surface, initially in March 2011 which levelled a section of the lane for greater access for 4x4s but removed the character of the lane. In November 2012 further repairs were carried out to approximately 500m section which involved the resurfacing of the lane with road planings, the charm and character of the lane  has now been completely altered, and now some 9 months since those repairs were completed the lane is once again in need of repair, due to the over use of the lane by recreational vehicles causing enhanced erosion. This is an unnecessary cost to the local tax payers and is unsustainable, with repairs being required on a regular basis. To summarise in  3 ½ years since the re classification of Chertpit lane to BOAT status it has gone from a tranquil grass covered lane, safe for all soft user groups to a dangerous, damaged, noisy tarmac  covered Lane, with a loss of amenity to the community and visitors to the Peak District.Please view photographs attached pages  2 – 8, of damage caused by recreational vehicles and Chertpit Lane in use by various user groups. Chertpit Lane is not an exception  within the Peak District National Park with recreational vehicles  causing similar problems to communities thought the National Park.&#xa0;To address these problems outlined above there is an opportunity for amendments to be made to the deregulation bill for green lanes to be given back to the communities for their quiet enjoyment.&#xa0;&#xa0; We propose :-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;In addition to the views of “rocking the BOAT” we expressly support the formal submissions made by The Green Lanes Environmental Action Group (GLEAM),by the Green Lanes Protection Group (GLPG), by the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance (PDGLA) and the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance (YDGLA )&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;David MacDonald&#xa0;Chair rocking the BOAT&#xa0;15th September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;Chertpit &amp; Leys Lane Record and Comparitive Pictures from 2010  to 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;October 2010 A green lane               damage to wall footing   September 2012 &#xa0;1September 2010 before DCC worksSeptember 2010 4x4 on narrow sectionWalkers are trapped in front of the 4x4’s&#xa0;October 2010  A green laneSeptember2012&#xa0;November 2011  level surfaceSeptember 2012 Rutted &amp; lose surface&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;November 2011 level surface &#xa0;&#xa0;              September 2011 Rutted &amp; lose stone surfaceOctober 2010 A green lane              &#xa0;&#xa0;September 2012December 2011 4x4 convoy December 2011 Oil deposits left by 4x4 convoy&#xa0;July 2012 Verge damage July 2012 4X4 tyre tracks tight to walls July 2012 Damage to wall adjacent to gate post     April 2012 4x4 Tyre tracks over right verge/wall March 2012 4x4 come off the lane knock down wallMarch 2012 verge and wall damage&#xa0; March 2012 wall pushed over by 4x4April 2011 Wall fall into lane July 2012 Conservation of Melancholy Thistle       March 2012 Tyre tracks against wall &amp; damage&#xa0;&#xa0;September 2012 Longstone ChaseSeptember 2012 Cyclists avoid rutsNovember 2011 Cyclists &amp; 3xTrial bikes2012Trail Bike at speed  at Dale FarmJune 2012 Waiting for convoy to passMarch 2012  9 Trail bikes through narrow section&#xa0; July 2012 4X4 debris       July 2012 4x4 gouge marks&#xa0;Aug 2013 tarmac planings ware rutsAugust 2013 wear to planings                                                          August 2013 Now a dangerous surface trail bike skid 15m longAugust 2013&#xa0;&#xa0; August 2013 low visibility for fast moving trail bikesAugust 2013 Ware to planings fused together&#xa0;&#xa0;8&#xa0; Pictures not published here Picture not published here Picture not published here.
