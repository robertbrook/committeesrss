defaultWritten evidence from esure Group plc (CMI0009)
default&#xa0;
defaultExecutive Summarydefault&#xa0;
defaultesure Group plc is a top 10 personal lines insurer providing private car insurance to over 1.3million UK customers through its core brands, esure and Sheilas’ Wheels, plus the smaller First Alternative brand. We are active members of the Association of Bri
defaulttish Insurers and represented on the A
defaultBI’s General Insurance Council
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe submitted a detailed response to the original call for evidence by the Transport Select Committee and this paper should be read in conjunction with that response. In addition, we 
defaultalso responded to the Ministry of Justice Consultation regarding the cost and frequency of whiplash claims.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs a major UK motor insurer we experience first hand the challenges outlined by both the committee and the MOJ in dealing with fraudulent and exaggerated whiplash claims, the cost of which is a major consideration when setting premium levels for UK 
defaultconsume
defaultr
defaults. Whilst we take the view that some progress has been made in reducing the costs associated with whiplash claims, there remains more work to do
default,
default particularly around tackling fraud.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe note the concerns of the Transport Select Committee
default that there is a d
defaultesire for clarity around how some of the proposals made thus far
default will be taken forward
default. In addition, a
default further request has been made f
defaulto
defaultr
default stakeholders to set out what more can be done to tackle the whiplash issue.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhilst we have reviewed and contributed to
default the response formulated by our trade body, the Association of British Insurers, this papers sets out our views on the 
defaultkey
default issues arising from the debate for the consideration of the committee.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultDiscussiondefault&#xa0;
defaultWhy is Further Reform Needed?
default&#xa0;
defaultThe starting 
defaultpoint when considering the way ahead is to look at the original motivation for trying to reform and improve the compensation system for genuinely injured claimants. The statistics speak for themselves in that the UK
default population
default makes a disproportionately hi
defaultgher number of whiplash claims when compared to other
default 
defaultEuropean
default countries.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe insurance industry has long campaigned for a system with more teeth to tackle spurious personal injury claims and Governm
defaultent has responded by making a number of
default changes to the f
defaultunding of personal injury claims. There can be no dispute that car insurance premiums have been falling over the last 12-months and the latest Confused.Com/Towers Watson Car Insurance Price Index points to a 13.9% reduction over this period.
default&#xa0;
defaultTherefore, it
default is clear that the ind
defaultustry has been delivering on its promise to offer
default lower premiums for UK 
defaultconsumer
defaults. This has been achieved despite increases in personal injury awards of
default over 20% in the last 18-months alone.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is a clear need for further 
defaultreform if the savings delivered for consumers are to be sustainable in the 
defaultmedium term and we believe the following
default are key 
defaultareas for Government to focus on
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultIncrease in the Small Claims Track
default&#xa0;
defaultWe share the committee’s apparent view that the MOJ has been 
defaulttoo dismissive of the possibility of raising the Small Claims Track (SCT) limit given that such a small proportion of personal injury claims now fall to be dealt with under the SCT. The current limit has been in place since 1991 and the latest statistics s
defaultuggest that only 9% of PI claims are dealt with by the SCT.
default&#xa0;
defaultBy definition, the SCT is designed and intended for simple, straightforward low value disputes. It is our considered view that straightforward, genuine whiplash claims do not necessarily require 
defaultthe assistance of a Lawyer and claimants should be given an alternative route to compensation. There is often scepticism when an insurer offers to deal with a claimant directly and we believe that the platform for the electronic handling of claims is alrea
defaultdy in place and that this, when coupled with standardised medico-legal re
defaultport
defaults
default, will
default provide a solution that is fit for purpose and will deliver cost and efficiency benefits.
default The bulk of whiplash claims do not entail complex legal issues.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe strongly beli
defaulteve that Government should look again at increasing the SCT to £5,000 and consider the solutions put forward by the industry that will address any concerns around access to justice. The solutions include:
default&#xa0;
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAn improve
defaultd system of
default education so that the public
default have awareness and visibility around how to make a claim, should they ever need to do so.
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe mandatory use by claimants and defendants of a software based damages calibration tool ensuring consistent and transparent levels of personal injury damages.
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe
default option of staff to be employed by the Portal Co to process paper claims for those without access to the internet or a personal preference 
defaultto deal in paper.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe believe that this is the biggest opportunity missed by the MOJ and we would urge the committee 
defaultto probe deeper into the decision to defer any increase for the time being.
default&#xa0;
defaultTackling Fraud
default&#xa0;
defaultAs 
defaultreferred to
default previously, we share the concerns of the industry that more assistance is need
defaulted
default in tackling the problem of fraud. The ABI is seeking 
defaultto 
defaultshare great
defaulter amounts of data with organisations such as 
defaultthe Motor Accident Solicitors Society (
defaultMASS
default)
default,
default the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers
default 
default(
defaultAPIL
default)
default,
default Motor Insurers Bureau
default 
default(
defaultMIB
default)
default and the Law Society but this focus is very much on facilitating the detection of fraud.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultA significant difficulty for compensators however is the way in which the Courts deal with fraudulent claims once they 
defaulthave been identified and it is submitted that the Judgment in Summers v Fairclough Holmes (2012) highlights the barriers 
defaultfaced by compensators. T
defaulthe Court concluded that
default the
default strike out of a claim on account
default of fraud
default is permissible but only at the conclusion
default of the claim in 
default‘
defaultexceptional circumstances
default’
default by which point substantial legal costs have been incurred. The compensator rarely recovers such costs.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe would like to see the law reformed in the area of fraud in personal injury claims with the default posit
defaultion b
defaulteing
default automatic strike out of a claim where exaggeration or fraud is proven. We urge Government to give approval to the Law Commission proposal to undertake further work in this area.
default&#xa0;
defaultProgressing Reform of Medico-legal Reporting
default&#xa0;
defaultWe fully support Gove
defaultrnment proposals to reform medico-legal reporting in low value claims. A perverse system has developed whereby those preparing the reports are financially incentivised for firstly making a diagnosis of whiplash 
defaultand then arguably some will
default secure greater le
defaultvels of work by providing the lengthiest prognosis period. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are very much of the view that medico-legal reform is one of the easier issues to tackle given the apparent large areas of agreement between the ABI and 
defaultMASS
default, the Association of Medical Report
default Associations (AMRO) and the Forum of Insurance Lawyers
default (FOIL)
default. We strongly advocate engagement and collaboration between the parties in order to bring absolute financial independence between the medic and those instructing them. Improved training and a sy
defaultstem of accreditation is very much needed so that those compiling reports on whiplash actually understand the condition. Standardised instructions (including documentary evidence around the accident itself
default)
default, reporting and a system of audit/peer review are 
defaultall essential elements of successful reform in our opinion.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhilst improving the quality and accuracy of medico-legal reports is of paramount importance, the cost of medico-legal reporting is also in need of urgent review. Whilst informal agreements are i
defaultn place in the form of the AMRO Agreement, there is general acknowledgment 
defaultthat 
defaultthe
default fees are not enforceable and the Courts regularly depart 
defaultfrom these rates and award higher amounts. As with the level of legal costs payable to lawyers, the costs payable 
defaultfor medico-legal report
defaults are now at artificially high levels.
default Referral fees were previously paid within the current fee structure, so it is clear that excess cost remains within the system.
default We support an evaluation of the true costs involved in producing a
default medico-legal report and following consultation/agreement the level of fees payable should be fixed within the CPR.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhilst we accept entirely that your recent call for evidence touches upon other areas outside the scope of this response, we have concentra
defaultted on the key areas, which we believe will make a real demonstrable difference in tackling fraud, reducing
default frequency and containing costs.
