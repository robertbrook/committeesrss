defaultWhat are the relative merits of using gas to directly provide space heating compared to centralised electricity production plus domestic heat pumps?
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultThis depends on the efficiency of the power station in c
defaultonverting gas to electricity (normally around 50%) and the Co-efficient of Performance 
default(CoP) 
defaultof the 
defaultground source
default heat pumps (normally around 400%). If heat pumps 
defaultare poorly installed there is a danger that the CoP could fall to 200% and, at that level, there would be no merit in using heat pumps. 
defaultGround source heat pumps can now be used in conjunction with solar thermal collection in summer and heat storage in gro
defaultund arrays to yield COPs of over 500%. In these installations a clear advantage can be demonstrated for centralised electricity production plus domestic 
defaultground source 
defaultheat pumps.
defaultGround source heat pumps in well insulated buildings can be set to provide ba
defaultckground heating at night (when electricity supply is significantly cheaper).

default&#xa0;
defaultWhy is community heating/CHP not more common in the UK?
defaultLegal problems and custom have held back district heating schemes in the UK, as well as issues of measuring heat used b
defaulty customers of district heating. CHP has advantages in the heating season – but only marginal advantage in summer, unless connected to Seasonal Thermal Energy Storage.

defaultShould the government take any further any specific actions in relation to cooling? 
defaultWe know that DECC are opposed to the idea of subsidising cooling by air conditioning: we are very much in sympathy with the idea that standard air conditioning should not be encouraged – because there are large carbon emission implications. This is because
default the standard approach to cooling – heat 
defaultexchange with h
defaultot air – is expensive in electricity [and therefore carbon emissions].  The CoP (
defaultCoefficient of Performance) of 
defaulta 
defaultroof-mounted 
defaultchiller can be as low as 1.5 on a hot day [1 kilowatt of electricity is n
defaulteeded to provide 1.5 kW of cooling].  However, some cooling is necessary, and there is a very much more effective way of achieving this – by employing ground source energy and 
defaultallowing 
defaultheat
default to escape to
default cold ground instead of forcing heat into hot air.  Th
defaulte CoP of “free cooling” (heat exchange with cold ground by means of a circulation pump) can be as high as 25. The CoP of Renewable Cooling (heat exchange with cold ground 
defaultassisted by
default a reversible heat pump) can frequently achieve a CoP of 
default8
default. 
defaultThe carbon 
defaultemission savings of using Renewable Cooling, instead of standard Air Conditioning,
default are huge
default and we believe that DECC will come to see that these should be encouraged.
defaultThere will need to be appropriate safeguards, which could be defined in terms of requirin
defaultg a high CoP before Renewable Cooling is recognised and requiring a high temperature set point so that Cooling is only used when necessary (rather than as an indulgence).
defaultDECC needs to acknowledge that a by-product of Renewable Cooling is to heat the groun
defaultd. The heat in the ground becomes a major asset when heating is required the following winter. Renewable Heating makes Renewable Cooling 
defaultmore
default efficient 
defaultand vice versa
default.
defaultDECC ha
defaults 
defaultbeen 
defaultinclined to reject 
defaultsubsidy for renewable cooling as their interpretation o
defaultf the Renewable Energy Directive
default 
default(RED)
default is that it would not count as “renewable”
default,
default although it would save significant CO2 emissions. We think that DECC, which frequently claims that the RHI is a “world first”,
default should be making the case to Brusse
defaultls, rather t
defaulthan follow
defaulting
default 
defaultDECC’s
default own timid interpretation of the RED.

defaultWhy does the RHI not seem to promote heat pumps successfully? 
defaultThe practical effect of DECC policy (although not the intention) has been to suppress the heat pump market
default and to drive some installers into insolvency

defaultGround source heat pumps can also recycle energy from summer to winter and, through thermal energy storage, they can balance the limitations o

defaultThe RHI provides an annual subsidy to reduce the annual cost of using renewable heat. The barrier to installing a ground source heat pump is not the annual running cost (which is 
defaultsmall) but the up-front capital cost (which is large).
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe RHI effectively aims to subsidise inefficient technologies over efficient ones. DECC argues that inefficient technologies need more subsidy to be employed. This discriminates against the use of eff
defaulticient technologies like ground source heat pumps. This is the opposite of what DECC should be doing.
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe RHI provides a subsidy to the owner of a building over many years if renewable heating is installed. The RHI provides no subsidy 
defaultat all 
defaultto the builder
default who often decides which form of heating will be used (and 
defaulttherefore
default chooses the cheapest capital cost).
default•
default&#xa0;
defaultHow successful will the RHI be when rolled out to households?
defaultThis 
defaultwill
default depend on the efficiency with which the RHI is administered by Ofgem. This, in turn, 
defaultwill
default depend on the complexity of the regulations Ofgem is asked to administer.
defaultDECC has taken far too long to decide its approach and has a tendency to introduce impracti
defaultcal and confusing elements that will add to the cost of administration and present barriers to uptake.  The idea of using EPC certificates as the financial basis of administering the Domestic RHI is unhelpful. EPC certificates were introduced for other rea
defaultsons and DECC should not attempt to pass off responsibility in this way to estate agents who are not knowledgeable and are not disinterested parties.
defaultWe fear that there may be more people employed by Ofgem to administer the RHI than there will be people em
defaultployed in the country to install ground source heat pumps.

defaultThermal storage is a potential useful method of balancing electricity/energy demand both diurnally and annually.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultT
defaulthermal storage using seasonal thermal energy storage is a simple and practical 
defaultmethod of balancing energy demand which is already in use in the UK. Government policy has not yet recognised the merits of this approach in saving carbon emissions
default.
default The misconceived policy of “naturally occurring energy”
default held back market developments in t
defaulthis 
defaultinnovative 
defaulttechnology. DECC has
default now
default recognised that this was inappropriate, but
default 
defaultthe Statutory Instrument of 28 November 2011 has not yet been updated. 
defaultWhat is government policy doing to promote thermal storage, and should it do more/different?
defaultWe are not yet aware of any government policy to promote thermal storage – in spite of the power of thermal storage to reduce overall energy consumption and reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly. 
defaultGovernment policy urgently needs to recognise and p
defaultromote 
defaultSeasonal Thermal Energy Storagedefault as a means of saving carbon emissions. The Government should also encourage all forms of Heat Recovery 
defaultwhere this can be used in conjunction with thermal storage in order to save carbon emissions. 
defaultICAX is a British c
