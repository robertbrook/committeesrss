defaultApproximately year ago, Transport for London installed an Early Start Traffic Light Scheme at the Bow Roundabout to improve safety at the Bow Roundabout
default 
default(BBC News, 2013)
default. Prior to this safety intervention, a Cycle Super Highways (Blue Colour pathway) Scheme was introduced by the Transport for London in 2010. Transport for London
default took a decision to make these interventions after consultation with 
defaultcy
defaultcling, road user and safety organisations

defaultPerhaps, t
defaulthe integrated risk assessment and reviews were not conducted by traffic engineer
defaults or designers or contractors as they

default&#xa0;
defaultThe te
defaultxt in the fo
defaultllowing 
defaultsection presents 
defaultthe 
defaultidea of
default Syste
defaultms Thinking 
defaultApproach to 
defaultSafety. 
defaultThis a
defaultpproach was presented by author in hi
defaults publication in 2006
default and in free online publication in 2012
default 
default(Appicharla, 2006)
default,
default 
default(Appicharla, 2012)
default. 
defaultThis follows the 
defaultSoft Systems Thinking 
defaulttradition started by Peter Checkland
default 
default(Checkland, 2000)
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe hypotheses underlying the Systems Thinking Approach to Safety are as under:
defaulta)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRelease of harmful energy
default is a prior co
defaultndition
default/state
default to any 
defaultphysical 
defaultevent involving harm
default 
defaultb)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLack of 
defaultprotective measures to 
defaultmitigate the harmful energy so released leads
default to injuries, loss
default of limbs and lives
defaultc)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultManagerial oversights and assumed risk 
default(acceptable
default 
defaultrisks are
default risks accepted 
defaultby an authority after a formal risk 
defaultassessment)
default are 
defaultfallible decisions that trigger the accidental flow of events. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe single factor behind the lack of availability of safety measures to guard against the release of hazardous energy is
default the 
defaultsystematic 
defaulterrors committed (
defaultinherent biases
default)
default in safety evaluations and risk assessments. Therefore, 
defaultthe 
defaultutility of Systems Thinking Approach to Safety lies in screening out of hazardous scenarios from the concept of operations itself such that either the activity it
defaultself can be modified or specification of the infrastructure and control systems may be written in a such way that probability of hazardous scenarios can be eliminated or controlled to the extent that it is no longer a cause for concern. 
default&#xa0;
defaultObjections agains
defaultt the utility of Systems Thinking Approach to Safety by the adherents of traditional probabilisti
defaultc and/or statistical 
defaultapproach to risk management 
defaultare answered in t
defaulthis way. T
defaultraditional method of estimatin
defaultg numerically the risk 
defaultposed by
default an activity using the
default data collected from past accidents and 
defaultby treating accident
default fatalities 
defaultas a random variable does not yield insight into whether 
defaultthe activity is itself is safe or not due to availability 
defaultand representative 
defaultbiases (pp137)
default 
default(Kahneman, 
default2011)
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTraditional d
defaultecision making process entails making choices for the future to solve a given problem with various constraints impinging upon the solution. Both in theory and practise, 
defaultutilitarian 
defaultdecision making entails a view to be taken of pr
defaultevalent state of affair(s)
default and partition them into risk less and risky choices 
default. 
defaultThis representation takes the shape of an event tree diagram and probabilities are worked out against each outcome used in probabilistic risk assessment used by risk assessor 
defaultand managers. The details of probabilistic risk assessment and its inadequacy to deal with human error were discussed by James Reason and therefore, not discussed again (pp219)
default 
default(Reason, 1990)
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultProspect theory advanced by Nobe
defaultl Laureate Daniel Kahneman and his collab
defaultorator, Amos Tversky, highlights errors in
default the traditional utilitarian decision making and suggest the idea that emotions of hope and fear colour the 
defaultchoices we make when we want 
defaultconfront the problem of decis
defaultion mak
defaulting under risk. 
defaultThus, drawing lessons from the Prospect 
defaultTheory
default 
defaultand his own 2010 publication 
defaultauthor arrives at the judgement that long standing debate on morality and economics of safety can be concluded in favour of morality. 
defaultAuthor’s 2010 publication argu
defaulted that 
defaultGroup-think bias
default is major factor in decision makin
defaultg when setting safety standards was
default noted by 
default 
default(Appicharla, 2010)
default.

defaultIf we consider the accident metric of fatality per millions of
default cycle trips then the data is presented in the form of 
defaulta s
defaultcatter Graph using Microsoft excel for the ten observation periods.  The accident metric has never fallen below 2.04 deaths per million of cycle trips during the 
defaultpast 
defaultten observation 
defaultperiods (See Figure2).   
defaultMoreover the inspection of the graph shows that 
defaultthere is no co-relation between the average cycle trips per day and the resulting fatalities. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe figure of 2.04 deaths per million of cycle trips can be regarded as a subjective measure of mortality risk as per Paul Slovic‘s psychological criteria
default 
default(Kahneman, 2011)
default. However, the figure compared against a scientific criterion of chances of death per million, it is clear that the human activit
defaulty of cycling in London
default has become dangerous.
default&#xa0;
defaultFigure 
default2
default Scatter
default graph representation 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe risk 
defaultassessment 
defaultcriterion of one chance per million opportunities is
default derived from Ian Murphy’s 1997 publication
default 
default(Murphy, 1997)
default. 
defaultApart from one outlier 
default(2008) 
defaultduring the observational 
defaultperiod where the metric went down to 8 fatalities, the fatalities have been consistently in the double figure range. 
defaultFurther
default, statistics perspective of fatalities calculated are mean=15.6, median = 15.5, mode is 19 and standard deviation is 4.32. From thes
defaulte figures, using a Poisson probability distribution, the probability of first fatality is less than .04%. 
default Author is of the opinion that cautious behaviour on part of the cyclists and road drivers shows up as a constraint upon the accident fatalities in ac
defaultcordance with Dr Ashby’s perspective
default 
default(Ashby, 1957)
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAuthor has noted that risk of death from a cardio vascular heart 
defaultdisease (
defaultCVD) 
defaultis greater than risk tha
defaultn death from a cycle accident
default. It is expected by World Health Organisation that 
defaultsome 23
default.3 million deaths are likely
default due to CVD in 2030. 
default The most important behavioural risk factors of heart disease and stroke are unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobac
defaultco use and harmful use of alcohol. Behavioural risk factors are responsible for about 80% of coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, the text 
defaultin this section shows that 
defaultresearch into behavioural attitudes of cyclists as suggested by 
defaultTransport for London document is 
defaultnot useful 
defaultactivity
default. Let us consider the fact that 
defaultin 2009 there were 13 fatalities 
defaultand 3396 injuries (see Chapter 2 London Transport document).  
defaultFrom t
defaulthese figures 
defaultit can be inferred that
default there were 3409 collision events
default between a cyclist and other vehicle
default in the following manner
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultUsing 
defaultthe Bayesian Rules of conditional probabilities, we 
defaultcan work out the probabilities of human actors’ performance 
default 
default(Pal &amp; Sarkar, 2005)
default. 
defaultTotal 
defaultnumber of collis
defaultion events 
defaultreported 
defaultin 2009= 3409. For risk computational purposes, it is assumed that there are 10,000 hours per annum. 
defaultLet 
defaultP (
defaultB) den
defaultote the total probability of interactions between road vehicle and cyclists. 
defaultThe base rate of injurious collisions 
defaultevents 
defaultper year 
defaultsuffered by cyclists
default= P (A) = 3409/10000= 0.3409
defaultThe base r
defaultate of non –fatal non- injurious interaction events 
defaultper year = P (A
defaultC
default) = 1-0.3409= 0.6591
defaultThe probabi
defaultlity of a fatality given a colli
defaultsion situation = P (B/A) = 13/3409= .00381
defaultThe pr
defaultobability of an 
defaultinjury given a colli
defaultsion situation = P (B
defaultC
default/A) = 3396/3409=0.99619.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe
default number 
defaultof 
defaultevents in which 
defaultroad vehicle driver’s unreliability is indicated by the ratio 
default= 
defaultP (
defaultB
defaultC
default/A
defaultC
default) =
default 
default13*6561/3409= 25.
default 
defaultThus, the probability of fatality involving a 
defaultcyclist
default’s unreliable performance in
default creating a collusion situation = 13/13+25= .3411 or 34%. 
defaultThe rest 66% contribution to danger can be attributed to road users and other authorities. 
defaultThis way of calculation can be
default 
defaultevaluated using the example of accident a
defaultnalysis given by the Bayesian inference 
defaultby Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman
default 
default(Kahneman, 2011)
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultJames Reason (1990) argued that problem solvers tend to over simply causality (pp91)
default 
default(Reason, 1990)
default. Cau
defaultsal explanations suffer from various kinds of biases. 
defaultAuthor has noted the fact Nobel Laureate Bertrand Russell’s 
defaultperceptual 
defaultaccount o
defaultf everyday world
default of seeing, hearing, touching, smelling and tasting subs
defaulttances is an illusion. 
defaultBertrand Russell may be ech
defaultoing the ancient statement of Epicharamus that it is the mind that sees and hears; all besides is deaf and blind is stated by Arthur Schopenhauer
default 
default(Schopenhaeur, 1813/2006)
default.  
defaultAccording to Arthur Schopenhauer, to order to contemp
defaultlate an explanation for a particular thing, one must assume that there is subject (oneself) that thinks about the object 
default(to
default be explained)
default. However, in the cases of explaining a sequence of events that led to an accidental death, we must be carefully to av
defaultoid repeating errors committed by David Hume and Immanuel Kant in their causal explanations. David Hume asserts that all consequence is mere sequence of perceptions whereas Kant affirms that all sequence of perceptions must necessarily be consequence. The 
defaultlaw of causality is not known to us empirically but is given a priory (pp 106
default/107
default)
default 
default(Schopenhaeur, 1813/2006)
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultO
defaultverthrowing of causality 
defaultas suggested by Bertrand Russell 
defaultfollowing the sceptical philosophy of David Hume is
default not a remedy 
defaultin the hope that science has absorbed all philosophy

default&#xa0;
defaultThe Tab
defaultle 1 shows that human (
defaultlatent failures) committed by various stakeholder
default(s) organisations 
defaultdominate
default the rare and bad event of a cyclist accidental death. 
defaultThe stakeholder organisations range f
defaultrom the legislative 
default(
defaultcentral and local
default) assemblies, academic,
default research 
defaultand supply 
defaultorganisations who advise the departments within the statutory transport organisations, and organisations investigating road accidents
default as well
default.  
defaultFrom the partial HAZOP study i
defaultt can be inferred that accelerating motorised traffic relative to cyclist is an occupational hazard. 
defaultBecause in a relative (from Albert 
defaultEinstein’s perspective)
default 
defaultuniverse, 
defaultinertial path is longer
default than accelerated path
default or in geometric terms, the diagonal of a
default triangle is less than 
defaultsum of it sides is shown by Sir Roger Penrose
default 
default(Penrose, 2004)
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHaving established the fact that the Traffic Light System can induce errors and contribute a collision hazard, it is necessary to pay atten
defaulttion to the barriers that can prevent and protect the cyclist from this occupation hazard. 
defaultPedestrians are also killed due to error in the specification of traffic light systems. 
defaultA road user may be presented with a green aspect and motorised traffic with a
default flashing amber aspect thus giving rise to an opportunity for an accelerating motor traffic   to collide with a pedestrian. This aspect is usually ignored by safety researchers. For
default example
default, a study of Transport for London on Pedestrian Safety completely 
defaultignored 
defaultrole of traffic lights and focused on behavioural aspects and measures to remedy the behaviour.

defaultThe proposed cycle early-start facility on the westbound section of Bow roundabout was designed to provide further improvements for cyclists. The intention was to get cyclists ahead
default of the westbound traffic and to cross the roundabout ahead of vehicles turning left. Further lessons learnt have led to improving the traffic light timings to allow more time for cyclists to get across the roundabout. Additionally, with the provision of d

defaultThe third information item
default on page 
default3
default may be surprising to 
defaultan 
defaultunfamiliar reader
default. 
default However, those who are conversant with the works of Dr Ashby work on Cybernetics know that information conveyed by a traffic light with a cycle symbol display contains a variety of messages
default 
default(Ashby, 1957)
default.  The meanings assigne
defaultd to the elements of the set of messages Red, Amber, and Green such as Stop, Caution and Go may appear unambiguous to the reader but physically these messages introduce ambiguity. There are cyclic transitions between aspects from Red to Red-Yellow, Yellow 
defaultto Green and Green-Yellow –Red to command stopped traffic to move and command a flowing traffic to a halt. Out of probable nine states (lit, unlit and failed state and ignoring the transitions pointed out earlier) only five are utilised by the road user to
default infer. In other words, a fraction of 5/8= .625 fraction of the probable states 
defaultfrom user perspective 
defaultis useful. Thus, the quantity of information used by a user of the traffic light system is only 62.5% and the rest 37.5% are don’t care situations. Apart 
defaultfrom this, the specification of the twin traffic lights systems assumes a mathematical Cartesian Framework of Co-ordinate system in infrastructure planning and delivery:  the eastbound cyclist has an early start and therefore will not be in conflict with t
defaulthe left turning vehicles. 
defaultIt is hard to imagine the role of non-Euclidean frameworks of Geometry in daily modern work life.  
default&#xa0;
defaultReactions to the Bow Roundabout accident by various stakeholders reported in the general press varied depending upon their roles:
default cyclist
default, lorry driver, commissioner of transport or CEO of a charitable organisation
default, and the Mayor of London. Cyclist Commissioner,
default 
defaultAndrew Gilligan, took a  
defaultpessimistic view that designing out hazards is not feasible
default 
default(BBC New
defaults, 2013)
default. The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, as a knee jerk reaction promised to invest one billion UK pounds of funds over next ten years to improve safety of the cyclists and appears to be sharing the same view advanced by
default 
defaultAndrew Gilligan by admitt
defaulting the idea that no traffic engineer in the world can imagine every eventuality that can occur on the road
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAuthor does not consider the proposition of how person A can harm person B unintentionally at a road junction cannot be imagined by a group of t
defaultraffic engineers, given the past history of such occurrences. However, author considers it is realistic to consider the idea that traffic engineers may be impaired in their ability to plan for safety improvements without giving rise to unintended effects. 
default Because they may be under cognitive stress to balance safety risk concerns against a legal and cost decision criterion and thus
default,
default may be biased in their approach to hazards management. 
defaultAuthor notes that Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman argued successfully t
defaulthat there is no such thing as cost efficient risk management criteria when moral intuitions are taken into account
default 
default(Kahneman, 2011)

defaultSafety and the avoidance of risk

default For more details on various interpretations of the word, risk, readers may wish to consult the paper hosted on the Stanford University Website
default 
default(Hansson, 2011)
default. There is an extensive discussion on 
defaultthe epistemological understand
defaulting and deﬁnition of risk
default in a paper published by 
defaultCatherine E. Althaus
default in 2005
default 
default(Althaus, 2005)
default.
default 
defaultCatherine E. Althaus
default argued in her 2005 paper that 
defaultstory of history about
default risk may be dating back 3102 BCE
default and other ancient civilisations
default. 
defaultFrom a hindsight perspective, author infers that the 
defaultchanting of peace mantras by the sages of the Upanishads indicates awareness of concept of harm 
defaultand peace on their part 
defaultdating back to 3000 BCE as per some historians
default o
defaultf ancient India
default 
default(Valerie, 2003)
default. 
defaultThus, author does not feel that there are 
defaultany 
defaultnovel ideas about risk assessment and
default 
defaultmanagement
default 
defaultof sources of harm (hazards) 
defaultin this submission. 
default  
defaultFrom a human error (Swiss Cheese Model) perspe
defaultctive, active errors are errors whose effects are felt immediately and latent errors are whose effects lay dormant for a time period
default. Human error experts acknowledge the idea that Management Oversight ad Risk Tree is a technique that can be used for organ
defaultisational analysis and safety studies in the published literature and on Wikipedia database
default 
default(Rasmussen, et al., 1994)
default.  
defaultBased upon the reading of the foregoing philosophical and psychological papers  author is of the p
defaultrofessional opinion that every accident can be prevented: blaming the active human errors on the part of the cyclist and/or truck driver involved in the accident, and/or defending the latent human error on the part of traffic engineer and managers, and/or 
defaultentertaining the naïve hope of raising awareness on the part of the cyclist or the heavy vehicle (lorry or bus driver) through technology, and/or accepting the theological position that such events are all acts of God 
default 
defaultis no solution to the problem faced b
defaulty the cyclist. Because cyclist accidental death arises from known physical, situational and cognitive factors and these factors may be managed through application of right resources: prioritising safety is absolutely necessary when using information contro
defaultl systems via modern technology that can unintentionally release harmful energy. An instance where these facts go recognised familiar to the author is drawn from the railway transport domain. Besides author, German academic aviation researchers and DB rail
defaultways are not convinced of the ability of the new European automatic train control system, ETCS, in averting hypothetical collisions between trains
default 
default(Appicharla, 2013)
default. An IEEE paper published by Armin Zimmermann and G
defaultunter Homm
defaultel
default of Technical Berlin University in 2003 observed that probability of trains braking under GSM-R radio based automatic train control system operating in moving block system is 94% for the time deadline of 6 seconds, braking distance of 4500 metres, length
default of 410 metres. The probability worsens with increase of time deadline and braking distance
default. Thus, positive safety performance of ETCS can be regarded as doubtful. Further, this conviction finds support in the case of metro train control system failures a
defaults well. The cancellation of Bombardier’s Signalling Contract by Transport for London is 
defaulta 
defaultevidence
default in support of the assertion made
default. 
defaultDespite the contrary and relevant evidence from three sources, the European Railway Agency and GB Railway Industry organi
defaultsations consider promoting the European Train Control System (ETCS) as a 
defaultsatisficing
default strategy. 
defaultDeveloping a common safety regulating strategy to promote ETCS as a standard automatic train control system is the main focus of managerial attention at this p
defaultoint of time. Author agrees to the idea that German aviation
default and DB railway 
defaultresearchers were right in drawing their readers’ attention to the inherent weakness in the ETCS technology. But German aviation researchers have not considered the contribution of 
defaultlatent human errors in the specification of the TCAS device in 2002 accident prior to thinking about the solution to the problem of rail and/or road accident situations
default.  Apart from the sources cited, author 
defaulthas 
defaultlearnt that practitioners in the safety cri
defaulttical railway domain suffer from lack of awareness of Systems Thinking Approach to Safety as well. This inference is drawn from reading Ali Hessami’s work on safety assurance approach 
default(A.G.Hessami, 2012)
default. Ali Hessami is the mai
defaultn author of the Yellow Book and CENELEC railway specific safety standards used by Network Rail, ORR, RSSB, ATOC and Transport for London Railway Organisations for safety assurance.  Ali Hessami follows the traditional methods of safety assurance assuming t
defaulthe equation user error equals human error. In his previous role of Head of System Safety, Ali Hessami promoted the Yellow Book for Engineering Safety Management methods. 
defaultThe utility of application of Yellow Book type or fault and event tree modelling proce
defaultss for supporting safety critical decisions is learnt from the example as these procedures cannot be used for modelling fallible decisions that shape the performance of operators or users of electrical/programmable/ software electronic control systems. 
defaultJa
defaultmes Reason (1990) observed that failure types that originate at the management layers and take the shape of fallible decisions and finding ways to neutralising these the major challenge facing human factor researchers with preserving the safety of complex,
default high risk systems. This Submission has shown how the fallible decisions
default when implemented that pose danger to 
defaulta cyclist
default 
defaultfrom a particular example of Bow Roundabout Accident 
defaultcan be revealed 
defaultwithout conducting 
defaultdeep mathematical and 
defaultpsychological research. 
defaultAu
defaultthor has noted that risk can be approached in several ways and has made efforts to include all the perspectives into the accident modelling and analysis.
