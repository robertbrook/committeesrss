defaultMuch progress has been made in recent years to maximise UK value from (and influence in) ESA, through strategic investment in ESA operational programmes and in developing the ESA Harwell facility.  However, 
defaultcontinued and growing 
defaultsuccess in Europe requires a 
defaultsignificantly
default larger 
defaultUK 
defaultnational space programme, as 
defaultin 
defaultFrance, Germany and Italy;
default  
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe

defaultTelespazio VEGA played a leading role in producing the UKspace Trade Association input and fully endorses its key messages.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default1.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultESA has played a crucial role in building a competitive and innovative space industry in Europe. ESA’s procurement principles ensure that investment by Member States helps to shape ESA programmes and they ensure that this investment is channelled back proportionately into national priority areas. 
defaultJ

default has provided a reliable 
default–
default and
default 
defaultaccountable 
default–
default mechanism
default 
defaultfor guaranteeing return on investment by ESA member states.
default 
defaultWe
default want to see these principles retained. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the UK has won a greater share of EU space research grants and infrastructure and service contracts thus far than it has invested by virtue of its membership of the EU, suggesting that the UK fares well out of both ESA’s and the EU’s procurement processes
default;
default&#xa0;
default1.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultESA has changed considerably over the last decade
default.
default ESA has developed world-class skills and competences that must be retained and utilised.
default 
defaultIt has
default broadened its horizons from a s
defaultcientific R&amp;D organisation into one that also ha
defaults a strong focus on supporting i
defaultndustry. Especially through its ARTES

default&#xa0;
default1.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFor multinationals 
defaultsuch as the Telespazio Group, 
defaultESA has had a fundamental role in developing competence, competitiveness and trans-national supply chains
default. This has 
defaultallow
defaulted an
default overlap of technologies which helps 
defaultprovide core 
default capabilities 
defaultrequired on the 
defaultdifferent
default National Programmes;
default&#xa0;
default1.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default 
defaultESA and specifically 
defaultthe 
defaultE
defaulturopean Space Operations Centre in Germany (E
defaultSOC
default),
default has helped the UK d
defaultevelop European leadership in satellite ground segment and o
defaultperations at a low cost to the UK 
default(
defaultas 
defaultthe 
defaultreturn is partially allocated to Germany
default)
default;
default&#xa0;
default1.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe flexibility of the Optional Programmes has allowed the UK to develop leading technologies in th
defaulte more commercial Space sectors by targeting its investment in ESA in the most appropriate Programmes;
default&#xa0;
default1.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultESA has a long history of managing complex high
default 
defaulttechnology
default-
defaultri
defaultsk programmes. In most cases these have been successful and delivered on time and 
defaultto 
defaultbudget. 
defaultHowever, 
defaultthe Galileo procurement processes of both the European Commission and ESA proved susceptible to 
defaultp
defaultolitical 
defaultintervention, leading to cost overruns and delays, underlining the 
defaultneed for
default strong UK political engagement in 
defaultboth
default organisations
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe welcome the arrival of the EU into space policy. Space is increasingly vital for delivering public policy at local, regional, national and supra-national levels, and has a key role in reaching Lisbon Treaty objectives of a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy by creating high-skilled jobs, commercial opportunities, boosting innovation and improving citizens’ well-being and security. For example, Copernicus (formerly GMES) is a vital tool for the EU in environmental protection.
default&#xa0;
default2.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGiven ESA
default’
defaults success, 
defaultwe
default share the UK Government
default’s concern about any 
defaultoverly hasty move to bring ESA under the wing of the EU, and 
defaultsupport
default the Government
default’
defaults cautious approach to moving the two institutions closer together.
default 
defaultTo align the need for coordination with the importance of maintaining distinct roles, t
defaulthe 
defaultCommission’s proposal
default for ESA to set up a specific ESA directorate in charge of implementing EU programmes, under EU rules, should be evaluated.
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default 
defaultWe
default 
defaultstrongly support an EU role as space p
defaultolicy lead and sponsor for downstream services dedicated to socio-economic applications.
default 
defaultWe
default would like to see this EU role, promoting space exploitation, 
defaultbetter
default reflected 
defaultand co-ordinated 
defaultin Horizon 2020.
default&#xa0;
default2.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOverall UK advocacy in EU space areas remains under-resourced and under-structured, partly reflecting the fast evolving natur
defaulte of the EU’s space landscape. W
defaulte encourage UKSA to review and strengthen its own resourcing in
default relation 
defaultto EU space matters
default, including, for instance, 
defaultpromotion of
default more UK nationals in the EU’s growing space policy community
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultR&amp;D is 
defaultan important enabler 
defaultof economic growth
default and underpins the competitiveness of the space industry
default.  
defaultThe innovation component of the EU’s next seven-year budget is
default an opportunity to 
defaultbuild
default a platform for growth 
defaultand competitiveness
default. Asia, for example, currently reinvests 3.5% of total GDP in R&amp;
defaultD
default, whilst Europe commits just 2%. Placing Horizo
defaultn 2020
default at the centre of Europe's 
defaulteconomic plans 
defaultwould send a very clear message that the EU and its 
defaultM
defaultember 
defaultS
defaulttates are committed to fostering innovation and 
defaulteconomic 
defaultgrowth
default;
default&#xa0;
default3.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe long-term nature of R&amp;D cycles in the space sector means that stable funding is especially important for businesses. EU funding should focus on the very early stages of technology development in order to mitigate the risks for companies, universities and individuals investing in experimental technology and in 
defaultproving the feasibility of new
default satellite-enabled service capabilities
default;
default&#xa0;
default3.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA specific weakness of the EC’s FP7 research programme has been lack of funding for satellite communications and satellite navigation applications.
default&#xa0;
default DG ENT
defaultR
default’s space research programme largely ignores telecommunications, despite the contribution of satellite communications to growth and public policy, 
defaulte.g.
default in the EU Digital Agenda targets for 2020 for deployment of high-speed broadband to all European citizens. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFunding for developing satellite navigation applications has also been lacking in recent years, despite the progress made on the launch of the 
defaultGalileo
default satellites
default. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is essential that these 
defaultomissions 
defaultare 
defaultcorrected
default in Horizon 2020
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUKSA has been significantly under-resourced, affecting its relationships with industry, and degrading the perceived transparency of its decision-making.  Examples are in dealing with EC communications and in producing the
default promised National Space Policy;
default  
default&#xa0;
default4.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe
default believe that there are a number of improvements that could be made by UKSA
default.
default These
default include the need for UKSA to
default:
default&#xa0;
default4.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe failure of the UK to achieve any director in ESA, compared with three each for France, Italy and Germany, is a failure of
default ambition and influence by UKSA;
default&#xa0;
default4.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOn the European front to maintain momentum with ESA 
defaultthe UKSA
default must influence their Programmes to meet UK policy objectives. 
defaultThey
default must 
defaulttry to 
defaultoptimise the return from our
default ESA subscriptions in terms of noble w
defaultork which is focused on technologies with real market potential wherever possible
default;
default&#xa0;
default4.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUKSA must work closely with industry to ensure that together 
defaultwe
default are delivering on growth. The current work on the IGS is vital to reach the target 10% share of the global market by 2030.   Growth is driven by the downstream services market so we must target key sectors for growth and work with the other Catapults to fully exploit these markets. 
defaultWorking in partnership with other government departments the UKSA can work pro-actively to unlock barriers to market, support access to export markets and thus take science and technology into the global marketplace
default;
default&#xa0;
default4.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEffective ESA 
defaultand EC 
defaultengagement requires complementary national funding to create the conditions in which industry can win greater share
defaults
default of ESA noble work
default and EU funding
default. This approach is well recognised and practised by our 
defaultinter
defaultnational competitors. 
defaultWe
default therefore welcome the establishment of the National Space Technology Programme (a key recommendation of the first Space IGS in 2010) and its refinancing in the Autumn Statement of 2012. However, a stronger NSTP 
defaultis 
defaultan essential test of UKSA’s commitment to help maximise UK economic return from EU and ESA space spend
default. This is also key to
default risk reduction of new commercial initiatives which can then attract City funding.
default  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK has 
defaultdeveloped world leadership in both space science and in commercial export markets, part
defaultly from 
defaulttargeted investment in ESA programmes with proven 
defaultscientific and 
defaulteconomic 
defaultpotential, notably ARTES.  However, 
defaulta better balance between national and ESA investment is essential if the UK is to fully explo
defaultit its ESA (and EU) investments;
default&#xa0;
default5.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default 
defaultESA is a vital wealth creation mechanism for the UK space-enabled economy, providing an excellent means for UK
default-
defaultbased operators to leverage off leading edge UK technologies
default,
default 
defaultenabling 
defaultUK exports of high value 
defaultsatellite systems and services
default;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEarly decisions on investment in ESA programmes helps create a more strategic and long-term UK agenda in ESA; it helps industry plan ahead, develop technology roadmaps and identify export opportunities. It is vital that the UK invest strongly in the early phases of major programmes, in order to get sufficient control to deliver UK technology priorities an
defaultd maximise growth opportunities;
default&#xa0;
default5.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default 
defaultIndustry
default has demonstrated that there are strong
default commercial spinoff benefits from 
defaultearth observation, 
defaultspace science
default 
defaultand robotic exploration 
defaultin terms of
default&#xa0;
defaulttechnologies
default,
default and also in terms of software and services to the global Space market
default;
default&#xa0;
default5.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK has demonstrated that it achieves a better return on investment than other ESA Member States. This is primarily through its highly developed capacity to take ESA developed technology to the commercial market. It is also strongly influenced by the UK selection of ESA optional programmes that are better aligned to the global marketplace. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default6.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere 
defaultshould be a
default clear UK owner or overseer of resilience plans for the satellites and ground-based supporting infrastructures that provide critical UK 
defaultcapabilities
default and
default 
defaulta
default comprehensive analysis of space systems critical to the UK
default. This should 
defaultinclude 
defaultan analysis of
default the level of resilience of space-related capabilities or of mitigation measures in the event of disruption
default;
default&#xa0;
default6.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe threats from natural events in space are well understood
default and ESA has an on-going programme to provide monitoring and 
defaultwarnings of Space Weather events
default;
default&#xa0;
default6.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default Due to the sensitivities associated with Space Debris and the associated tracking of objects in earth orbit, the UKSA should look to other European nations such as Germany and France to develop ground based national systems to protect critical national space assets outside of ESA programmes.
