defaultINTRODUCTIONdefault:default 
defaultThe Road Danger R
defaulteduction Forum
default 
defaultwww.rdrf.org.uk
default was formed in 1993 to promote the idea that the civilised approach to safety on the road is to reduce danger on the road at source, namely from inappropriate use of motor vehicles, as part of the promotion of a sustainable transport policy. Support for RD
defaultRF is from local authorities that have signed the Road Danger Reduction Charter and bodies representing cyclists, pedestrians and proponents of road danger reduction. Supporting cycling safety has been a key plank of the programme of the RDRF.

defaultMAIN TOPICSdefault&#xa0;default2.1.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe safety question – a paradoxdefault:default We believe there is an apparent, but not actual, contradiction at work here. 
default2.2.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOn the one hand, cyclists are at risk from a wide variety of law- and rule-breaking behaviour by motorised road users. Much of this has been exacerbated by accommodating these b
defaultehaviours in traditional forms of highway design and also motor vehicle design. This kind of danger should be seen as simply intolerable and unacceptable. This should be based not just on the fact that people are dissuaded from cycling by danger – although
default this does occur - but because it is simply wrong: the behaviours concerned are often illegal and frequently endanger other road users as well.
default2.3.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOn the other hand, it is important to stress that cyclists in the UK, and particularly in urban areas
default, have
default very
default low chances of being seriously injured, and even lower ones of being killed. Overemphasising the chances of being hurt distorts the picture of cycling, not least in inhibiting people who wish to cycle from doing so – denying them health benefits due to fe
defaultar of danger. A feature of an anti-cycling culture is the persistent tendency to see cycling as “the problem”. Part of this is the “dangerising” of cycling, seeing it as an activity which is inherently hazardous, particularly if there are any motor vehicle
defaults anywhere nearby.
default2.4.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default It is absolutely central to any successful strategy that this state of affairs is seen as the paradox it is. Cycling, particularly in the areas where there is a lot of cycling already, should be seen as the low-risk activity it is. This
default should not, however, detract from promoting a step change in reducing danger to cyclists from motor vehicular traffic, by whatever means – law enforcement and sentencing, training, highway and infrastructure engineering – are necessary.
default2.5.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default 
defaultThe safety questidefaulton - Safety in Numbers (SiN):default We think that the experience of London, with a dramatic reduction in cyclist KSIs per journey in the last decade, shows that change has been achieved through SiN. For example, approximately the same number of cyclists is kille
defaultd in collisions with 
defaultlorries
default, with at least a doubling of the amount of cycling in the areas where most deaths occur, and an increase in lorry use. Denying this mechanism denies an important positive step forward, and unnecessarily dissuades people from cy
defaultcling: stopping them from cycling can have a deleterious effect not just on their health but on the safety of other cyclists. However:
default(a)
default&#xa0; 
defaultThis does 
defaultnotdefault mean that SiN 
defaulton its own will
default deliver enough of a  decline in danger
default(b)
default&#xa0; 
defaultSiN is particularly unlikely to be eff
defaultective on roads with very few cyclists and high speed limits, as well as with particularly incompetent drivers or drivers unwilling to drive properly.
default(c)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThose responsible for danger – whether highway authorities, individual motorists
default,
default motor manufacturers or 
defaultothers – should still be held accountable. Danger should be seen as unacceptable whether or not a collision occurs.
default2.6.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default 
defaultThe safety question – measuring dangerdefault: An aggregate measure of cyclist casualties or casualties per head of the population is at best 
defaultuseless, and at worst misleading. The measures to be used are:
defaultA.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCyclist KSIs per journey or distance travelleddefault – this is the minimum acceptable measure.
defaultB.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIdeally this measure should be refined 
defaultto consider the proportion of cases where a third party is at faudefaultltdefault – there is a qualitative difference between cases where this happens (e.g.  the result of careless driving) and where a cyclist is clearly at fault (e.g. being intoxicated and falling off a bicycle)
defaultC.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultObjective measures of danger.default Some locations
default,
default such as 
defaultmulti-lane junctions with high
default-
defaultspeed motor traffic
default,
default have obvious high levels of hazard. These locations can be assessed by measures such as the Cycle Skills 
defaultN
defaultetwork Audit, where locations are assessed in terms of the level of Bikeability skills required to 
defaultcycle
default there. 
default2.7.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFinally, there is an ambiguity in the use of the words “safe” and “dangerous”. We believe that attention should be directed towards dealing wit
defaulth danger at its source – from the inappropriate use of motor vehicles. It should be emphasised that although there is some degree of danger from cycling towards pedestrians and other cyclists, ti is minimal compared to that from motor vehicular traffic.  C
defaultycling, in 
defaultthat 
defaultsense, is a very safe mode of transport.

defaultTrafficdefault law and enforcement:default3.1.1.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis is the key element missing from cycle safety strategies such as The Times campaign.
default3.1.2.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default There 
defaultshould be a massive increase in the amount of law enforcement, focusing on behaviours that lead to predominant causes of cyclist KSIs: Overly close overtaking; careless opening of car doors, not watching out for cyclists in general and at junctions in part
defaulticular, and generally poor standards of driving. Most collisions involve typical motorists, rather than the minority of extremely bad drivers, although enforcement should also be applied here, backed up by deterrent sentencing.
default3.1.3.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default While misbehaviour by cycli
defaultsts, such as failing to obey traffic signals, should be addressed, enforcement should focus on behaviours most likely to endanger others – namely from rule- and law-breaking motoring – which will be of general benefit to the safety of all road users.
default3.1.4.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default Alth
defaultough we do not have the space to describe the moral and legal basis for this here, it will be necessary to consider stricter liability for motorists involved in collisions with cyclists and with pedestrians, to back up law enforcement.

default  defaultHighways and offdefault-road infrastructure.default3.2.1.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default It is likely that most cycling will continue to be in proximity to motorists on the public highway, who should expect cyclists to be sharing the road with them. 
default3.2.2.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, some features such as one-way gyratory systems and roundabouts and inherently inimical to cycling safety.  The aim should be to remove such features of the highway environment, or at least to provide safe and convenient alternatives for cyclists i
defaultn those areas. Reduction of motor vehicular capacity of the 
defaultnetwork in
default such situations is fully justified, if it is the only way to reduce danger to cyclists and support cycling.

defaultCycle Trainingdefault3.3.1.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default RDRF supporter Councils in York, LBs Lambeth and Ealing hav
defaulte been foremost in the “new wave” of cycle training starting in the late 1990s and designed to build cyclist confidence in real world conditions. The right kind of empowering cycle training can, we believe, increase amounts of cycling and reduce cyclist ca
defaultsualty rates through a Safety in Numbers effect. However, we are concerned that much supposed training does not conform to the spirit of National Standards (now “Bikeability”) cycle training and does not create confidence and an awareness of cyclists’ righ
defaultts as well as responsibilities. 
default3.3.2.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default   Due to a continuation of the kind of beliefs prevalent under old style “cycle proficiency”, trainees may be presented with dubious ideas about supposed inherent dangers of cycling and incorrect advice about equipment 
defaultsuch as hi-viz and cycle helmets.
default We believe it is essential to show that campaigns to promote cycle helmet and hi-viz use evade and confuse the issues which should be concentrated, as well as having a dubious or absent evidence base.

defaultMotorist training andefaultd cultural change.default3.4.1.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe believe that cyclist safety is just one part of the issues stemming from 
defaultinappropriate
default motor vehicle use. The problem is just one part of the problem of road danger. As such, 
defaultchanging motorist behaviour is of benefit not just to 
defaultcyclists but to all other road users.
default3.4.2.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMotorist training has to change from being a confidence booster building unjustified feeling of pride, to one of awareness of responsibilities towards to other road users.
default3.4.3.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCompulsory re-testing of drivers every five to
default ten years should be a requirement for general road danger reduction. An absolutely fundamental requirement is to achieve a cultural change where motorists realise their obligation towards cyclists as human beings with as much – if not more – right to use 
defaultthe road. Rarely regarded as of significance by transport professionals, we believe it is worthwhile examining prejudice and bigotry about, and displayed to, actual or potential cyclists. Negative attitudes among motorists can exacerbate the potential to e
defaultndanger cyclists or other road users, as well as putting off potential cyclists from cycling.
default3.4.4.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default   Negative attitudes and abuse towards cyclists should be countered. These can include those with regard to “paying road tax”, or the supposed superiority of dri
defaultving as a transport mode due to motorists having passed a driving test. As with other elements in this programme, there is a need to address more general transport policy issues than just those immediately relating to cycling.

defaultOther support for cycling.default3.5.1.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBecause of the low casualty rate, massive health benefits towards cyclists and others, reduction in environmental and other problems, cycling as a form of everyday transport should be properly supported.
default3.5.2.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn addition, as explained in 2 above, increasing the
default amount of cycling is part of dealing with the issue of danger towards cyclists. 
default3.5.3.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis should include not just provision of attractive highway and off-road environments, but also the realisation that inappropriate behaviour towards cyclists will become les
defaults socially tolerable.
default3.5.4.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt should also include:
default3.5.5.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultProgrammes to address other issues limiting take up of cycling, such as inadequate secure and convenient home cycle parking, 
default3.5.6.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDifficulty in accessing affordable bicycles and cycle accessories.
default3.5.7.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis has been par
defaulttly addressed by programmes associated with cycle training, such as London Borough of Ealing’s Direct Support for 
defaultCycling
default programme.

default of the chances of cyclists being hurt or killed. 
default4.2.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, this process needs to be accelerated by 
default4.3.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultExtension of existing provisions to limit use of HGVs in urb

defaultconsidered ,although
default this is of minor significance compared to other measures referred to. 
default4.4.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default In the absence of such features it will be necessary to massively increase law enforcement and raise sentences for HGV drivers
default who break the law. 
default4.5.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default Ultimately the freight issue, although 50% of cyclist deaths in London (and a large proportion outside) involve 
defaultlorries
default, is still a small part of the overall danger to cyclists. The problems ultimately come back to the behaviour of 
defaultthe person in charge of the vehicle posing more of a threat to others, whether a lorry driver, or in most cases the driver of another motor vehicle. Changing their behaviour has proved to be the most effective way of increasing cyclist safety.
