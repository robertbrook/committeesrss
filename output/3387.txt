[[[Information on practical ways in which the growth duty (clauses 58 to 61 of the draft Deregulation Bill) can affect regulators’ decisions]]]

[[[Impact on productivity: How can regulators reduce and keep unnecessary burdens to a minimum?]]]&#xa0;Companies House required businesses to fill out two forms to register changes in share ownership, rather than one. Moreover, businesses were required to provide data to Companies House annually, even when that data did not change from one year to the next, creating a burden on the business which did not add value to the firm. &#xa0;In this example, a growth duty could have influenced the regulator to consider the impact of their actions on productivity, and redesign forms, systems and processes to require businesses to submit information only once, updating any necessary details when they change rather than at regular intervals. &#xa0;

[[[Proportionality: How can growth factor in to regulators’ decisions about what interventions are used?]]]&#xa0;In the FoE review relating to small food manufacturing businesses, the rigid application of HACCP (the hazard analysis and critical control point system) specifically in relation to small businesses was highlighted as an issue. Small food businesses complained that food hygiene officers tended to favour the more burdensome and complicated HACCP system over smaller-scale risk assessment processes that are more manageable for small operators. This had the effect of extending controls more widely than necessary, resulting in extra burdens and unnecessary additional expenditure on compliance systems. &#xa0;In this case, a growth duty could have influenced the Food Standards Agency to issue guidance on approaches to risk assessment that more clearly articulates the need for officers to take a proportionate approach to advice and enforcement for small businesses. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Provision of tailored support: How can regulators understand the business perspective and choose interactions appropriate to where the business is in its lifecycle? ]]]&#xa0;The FoE review of the Adult Care Industry found a number of issues with the way the Care Quality Commission (CQC) delivered regulation that created burdens on operators that took resource away from providing care and running a compliant premises. Adult care providers complained of widespread duplication of activities by the CQC and local authorities, as well as a lack of coordination between the CQC and commissioners of places in homes. Providers also reported insufficient distinction in CQC’s handling of major and minor non-compliance issues when publicly naming non-compliant homes, and that re-inspection can be slow to occur, leaving a home open to be labeled as non-compliant when it has actually remedied any deficiencies. In the case of minor non-compliance issues this can divert a disproportionate level of resources into managing the understandable concerns of residents and their families, and into managing broader public relations, rather than into addressing the compliance issue itself. It can also directly affect a provider’s ability to trade whilst they are publicly labeled as non-compliant.&#xa0;In the case of heavily-regulated industries – such as the care sector – it makes sense for regulators to develop a deeper understanding of how these businesses operate and what other regulators are involved in the process to ensure that the business’ time and investment is spent on activities that improve compliance and add value to the business.   &#xa0;In this example, a growth duty could have encouraged regulators to work together more efficiently to reduce the cumulative burden on heavily-regulated sectors, such as care homes, while looking more broadly at individual care homes to understand how interventions fit within the wider lifecycle of that operator. It could also have led to more proportionate handling of minor non-compliance issues, to quicker re-inspection, or to homes being given a short initial target period to fix the issues before being named in a way that reduced their ability to trade (whilst still being able to apply this sanction if required).&#xa0;
