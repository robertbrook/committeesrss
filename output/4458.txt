[[[Dementia is a development issue]]]&#xa0;1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The burden of dementia is rapidly becoming a challenge to our global economic, health, and social landscape for both men and women.  Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General, declared dementia to be a global health priority.  In a 2012 WHO report, Dr Chan stated:  “The need for long-term care for people with dementia strains health and social systems, and budgets. The catastrophic cost of care drives millions of households below the poverty line. The overwhelming number of people whose lives are altered by dementia, combined with the staggering economic burden on families and nations, makes dementia a public health priority”.  1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There remains a tremendous lack of awareness in many lower and middle income countries, especially in Africa.  In the last few years a number of Alzheimer associations have started to work in African countries including Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Uganda, Mauritius and Namibia.  They all report a lack of understanding of dementia that is related to mystification and even witchcraft.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;2.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In 2010 there were an estimated 35.6 million people with Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias worldwide.  This number will increase to 66 million by the year 2015 and will rise to 135 million by 2050.  The main increase will be in low and middle income countries where more than 70% of people with dementia will live by 2050 (Figure 1).&#xa0;Figure 1&#xa0;2.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; While there continues to be no way of preventing or curing dementia these numbers will be driven up by the ageing world population.  An example of this is in India where it was estimated that in 2010 there were 3.7 million people with dementia rising to over 14 million by 2050, with approximately one half of that number being over 75 years, and almost 2 million over 90 years of age.  2.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Worldwide the elderly population is rapidly increasing and by 2050, adults over the age of 60 are expected to reach two billion as displayed in Figure 2, below (WHO, 2012). &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Figure 22.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; By 2030, the oldest segment of the population will increase by 200% in low- and middle-income countries and 68% in developed countries which is problematic because it is widely accepted that the main risk factor for dementia is age. The prevalence of dementia is projected to double every five years after the age of 65. Almost three-quarters of dementia cases will reside in low and middle income countries with most of Asia and Africa experiencing the fastest growth rate shown in the Table 1 at Annex 1.  &#xa0;

[[[[People with dementia] “should be part of the development agenda…we need to keep up the pressure on wealthy countries to live up to their responsibility.  …it needs ]]]

[[[proper resourcing and we should make sure it’s at the heart of the future development agenda.]]]David Cameron – 11th December 2013&#xa0;3.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In most developing countries the problem of dementia is, for a variety of reasons, hidden.  One report which identifies the scale and nature of the problem is Dementia India 2010.  This report results from a ‘twinning’ programme implemented by ADI, which twinned ‘Alzheimer’s and Related Disorders Society of India’ (ARDSI) with ‘Alzheimer’s Society’ based in London.  Alzheimer’s Society was able to assist ARDSI with the establishment of a national office in New Delhi; source funding within the UK for the Dementia India report; and secure scientific and editorial support from the Institute of Psychiatry at King’s College in London.  Dementia India not only gave details of numbers in India, it also analysed the impact of the condition in India and the services required for people living with the condition.  The report would not have been possible without the funding and support provided from within the UK voluntary and academic sectors.  It is indicative of the impact that a small intervention by voluntary organisations can have on dementia in developing countries.3.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;  It is the view of ADI and Alzheimer’s Society that intervention by the developed nations through their international aid programmes is the only way to tackle the global dementia epidemic, to reduce the numbers of people who will develop the condition; reduce the impact upon those with the condition and their families; and reduce the levels of poverty that are the inevitable result of dementia.3.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Dementia costs in 2010 totalled $604 billion worldwide.  If dementia was a country, it would be the 18th largest economy of the world, ranking in 2010 between Turkey and Indonesia.  In developing countries, there has been little work on evaluating direct and indirect costs because dementia is viewed as a low priority and fewer health economists have explored these regions.  With the lack of institutionalized care and healthcare resources, informal care makes up 58% of costs in low-income countries versus 40% in high-income countries.  This has a big impact on women and those in poverty.3.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As average life expectancy for women increases, especially among the “oldest old” group, more women are at risk of dementia  but a paradox exists because although women are living longer, they are living with more disabilities stemming from dementia . Not only are the numbers not in women’s favour,   research indicates women decline at faster speeds than men regarding cognitive functions.  Because dementia is expected to triple by 2050, women will be affected in other ways, as they become primary caregivers for loved ones, resulting in decreased participation in the workforce and a loss in wages . In fact, a majority of total costs from dementia derive from informal, usually unpaid care provided by spouses, daughters, and daughters-in-law .  Women are in jeopardy particularly because of gender disparities as more women are less educated, face higher poverty rates, and are valued less in certain societies. This is of concern especially in developing countries which intensify the disparities and inequalities women currently face and will continue to experience unless persistent action is taken at national and global levels by declaring dementia a woman’s health issue.3.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The G8 meeting on dementia in London has issued a declaration identifying dementia as a major disease burden and has resolved to increase significantly the resources devoted to dementia resource. This is greatly welcomed. But if dementia is to be, in the Prime Minister’s words, at the heart of the future development agenda then the UK needs to give a lead through its own development programme.  The meeting also resolved to support countries to strengthen health and social care systems to improve care and services for people with dementia.  This is something that can begin to have a more immediate impact as opposed to the long term impact of more and better research.&#xa0;

[[[There should be a global fight back to help those with dementia to live well and live with dignity.]]]David Cameron, 11th December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;4.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In the absence of almost any policy or action for people with dementia in the developing world the difficulty in identifying what can be done is: just where do we start?4.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Three priorities for the developed world to assist are clear.  The funding of research into prevention, treatment and care is one.  Such research may well be undertaken in the developed world but it is also important to grow research capacity in low and middle-income countries - particularly when evaluating care models.  A second is raising awareness - which amongst other things will help to reduce the levels of stigma experienced by people with dementia.  (The G8 Declaration recognised the need for greater respect and dignity for those affected by dementia and for global efforts to reduce stigma, exclusion and fear.)  The third is creating comprehensive care models suitable for the developing world, supported by research which identifies how this needs to differ from care models in the developed world.4.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This would assist the work already being undertaken by the developing world where strategies to combat dementia are being devised eg in Mexico and Peru; and in Pakistan where training programmes for GPs and social workers are being put together.  Capacity building and awareness are the two main challenges.4.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; For capacity building ADI has developed two successful programmes.  One is ‘Alzheimer’s University’ for emerging associations which takes place each year in London.  Alzheimer’s Society has always been involved in this and is supported by other developed associations in Europe and North America.  4.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The second programme is ‘twinning’, in which a developed association works with a developing association.  Alzheimer’s Society twinned with the Indian association resulting in an office in New Delhi being opened, to co-ordinate activities, raise awareness and promote the organisation with the Federal Government.  Funding for the Dementia India report was also found in the UK but more importantly that project was directed by the 10/66 group at Kings College, London (see 6.3).  Without the twinning programme that report would not have been published. Other twinning programmes were set up between, for example, Australia and Pakistan, Netherlands and Indonesia and between Canada and Trinidad &amp; Tobago.4.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Research within the developing world is essential to assist awareness and capacity building.  This can be founded upon work already done, eg care related (where much work has been done in the UK, facilitated by Alzheimer’s Society) and how care may vary between cultures (where the 10/66 Group has done some work).  Prevention research is also important and recent evidence suggesting that risk factors can be modified, and that these factors vary from country to country (largely lifestyle related) again suggests that this is undertaken within the low and middle-income countries.4.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To promote the work that needs to be done ADI is now seeking to start a global awareness programme.  This is an ambitious target but it has been greatly assisted by actions in the UK.  The raised level of dementia awareness in this county, prompted by Alzheimer’s Society, has led the British government to implement a comprehensive dementia strategy and in 2012 the Prime Minister issued a challenge to ALL government departments to seek ways to support the needs of people living with dementia.  To date, DFID has still to do so. With the UK now in the chair of G8, Mr Cameron convened a conference in London this year on 11th December to discuss the issue and there will be a further three conferences arranged next year.  We regard this as hugely important and indicative of the important role played by Britain in the dementia challenge.  However, the challenge goes beyond the G8 countries, making DFID’s involvement essential.4.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; DFID’s lack of response to the Prime Minister’s challenge is disappointing.  Even small interventions by DFID could be significant in raising awareness, building capacity and facilitating research.4.9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Such support would almost certainly have to be undertaken in conjunction with, or advised by, specialist agencies – three of which are based in London, namely: the 10/66 Group (based at Kings College, London); Alzheimer’s Disease International, possibly the single biggest source of information on dementia in the developing world through its 80 member countries; and Alzheimer’s Society which has experience in developing awareness;  researching dementia cause, cure, care and prevention; and providing support services in the UK.  It has also worked with and supported ADI – particularly in India.4.10&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; All three agencies would welcome a close working relationship with DFID to enable UK development aid to be directed towards the dementia challenge.              &#xa0;5.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Alzheimer’s Disease International (ADI) was created in 1984 by the Alzheimer societies of the UK, Canada, USA and Australia to be the global voice on dementia and exchange information between societies worldwide.  It has  80 member organisations from all parts of the world. All members are the leading patient and family organisations in their countries. There are currently a number of associations from Africa and the Middle East seeking support and once they are established they will become members in the next few years.  It is headquartered in London.5.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The 10/66 Dementia Research Group was formed in 1998 in India and is led by a research group from the Institute of Psychiatry, King’s College London. This group has done ground-breaking community based research in lower and middle-income countries into the prevalence and incidence of dementia, risk factors and social systems and has published over 60 scientific papers into the main international scientific journals. This included a series of five World Alzheimer Reports published with ADI since the year 2009 and the data from these reports are now the leading sources of information on dementia worldwide.5.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Alzheimer’s Society is the leading dementia charity in the UK, operating in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.  It has long established dementia support services and leads a multi-million pound dementia research funding programme primarily within the UK.  It has been credited with raising awareness of dementia to the extent that in 2007 the government made dementia a health priority and became the leading partner in the National Dementia Strategy.  It is working closely with the Prime Minister’s Challenge on dementia and is in the forefront of the work to create dementia friendly communities.&#xa0;Annex 1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;              December 2013&#xa0; Alzheimer’s Disease International;  64 Great Suffolk Street, London SE1 0BLCorrespondence: m.wortmann@alz.co.uk and aketteringham1@btinternet.com&#xa0; World Health Organization, 2012 World Alzheimer Report, 2009 Dementia India Report 2010, published by Alzheimer’s and Related Disorders Society of India.
