[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Written Evidence from [bold]Volunteer Cornwall[bold] [CEP0001][bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]I will keep this submission very short. Not all Charity Chief Executives are on large salaries. I run a Charity with a turnover of £2,000,000 on a salary of £37,206. The ration between my salary and the lowest paid member of staff in our 40 strong team is 
[normal]2.5.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I do the job because I am a values driven person. With qualification including an MBA and experience in business in the UK and overseas I could obtain income in a higher remunerated position but believe my time is better spent making people’s lives b
[normal]etter and improving the communities in which they live.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Most large salaries are generally aligned with large national charities not the majority of local charities which delivery services in their communities.
