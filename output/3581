default&#xa0;defaultWritten Evidence from defaultVolunteer Cornwalldefault [CEP0001]default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultI will keep this submission very short. Not all Charity Chief Executives are on large salaries. I run a Charity with a turnover of £2,000,000 on a salary of £37,206. The ration between my salary and the lowest paid member of staff in our 40 strong team is 
default2.5.
default&#xa0;
defaultI do the job because I am a values driven person. With qualification including an MBA and experience in business in the UK and overseas I could obtain income in a higher remunerated position but believe my time is better spent making people’s lives b
defaultetter and improving the communities in which they live.
default&#xa0;
defaultMost large salaries are generally aligned with large national charities not the majority of local charities which delivery services in their communities.
