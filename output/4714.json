"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Step Change in Safety Helicopter Safety Steering Group and Helicopter Task Group (HCS0009)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.2&#xa0; \n      Step Change in Safety&#xa0;&#xa0;1.2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nStep Change in Safety was founded in 1997 by the Oil\n and Gas industry trade associations with the aim of reducing all the UK offshore Oil and Gas industry injury rate by 50%.  By 2002 a new vision was created: “The UK is the safest place to work in the worldwide oil and gas industry by 2010” and Step Change\n moved to operate under the PILOT umbrella.\n&#xa0;\n1.2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn 2010, we launched our five year Strategic Plan 2010-2015, setting out how we would go about making the UK the safest oil and gas province in the world.  As we strive to deliver further improvements in safety \nperformance, it is of vital importance that our industry understands the challenges and barriers which stand between us and delivering our vision.\n&#xa0;\n1.2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs a tripartite body – representing the workforce, regulator and employers - Step Change is committed to inv\nolving everyone in safety improvement.  It is this broad stakeholder base that makes the Step Change group effective across the whole industry and seen globally as an example of best practice.\n1.2.4\n              \nWe want Step Change to be the driver for change in a numb\ner of key areas:\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe must have strong and sustainable leadership in health and safety.\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe must have the competence to identify hazards and ensure that risks are properly controlled.\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe must have a workforce that is fully engaged in health and safety.\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe \nmust raise standards and continually improve our health and safety performance.\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe must have effective asset integrity management.\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe must have effective systems of communication for health and safety issues.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;1.3&#xa0; \n     History of the HSSG&#xa0;1.3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe HSSG was formed\n under the auspices of Step Change in Safety in 2010, taking over from the work done by the Oil and Gas UK Helicopter Task Group which had been created to address cross-industry issues around helicopter safety, specifically those arising from the fatal hel\nicopter crash off the north-east coast of Scotland on 1 April 2009.\n&#xa0;\n1.3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRepresented on that task group were companies directly involved in the fatal accident, Oil &amp; Gas UK's Board and Council members, the offshore workforce, helicopter operators, HM Coastguar\nd, Grampian Police and trade unions.\n&#xa0;\n1.3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIts purpose was to act on behalf of the industry as a communications focal point for sharing information, advice and learning across the industry and with other stakeholders on matters arising from this and other helic\nopter accidents, including assisting with the implementation of any recommendations from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) inquiries.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.4&#xa0; \n        Representation on HSSG&#xa0;1.4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHSSG is made up of senior level representatives from the helicopter operator\ns, oil and gas operators and contractors, the offshore trade unions Unite and RMT, the pilots union BALPA, the CAA and HSE and the industry trade body, Oil and Gas UK.  The HSSG meets six times per year.  Membership of HSSG is reviewed annually to ensure i\nt continues to best represent the UK offshore sector.  HSSG has 2 co-chairs, one from a helicopter operator, the other from an oil company.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;1.5&#xa0; \n     HSSG Response to the EC225 ditchings in 2012&#xa0;1.5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn May and October 2012 there were two precautionary ditchings \nof EC225 aircraft.  The aircraft were forced to ditch because of failures of a shaft in the main gearbox which drove the two oil pumps providing gearbox lubrication.\n&#xa0;\n1.5.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFollowing the second incident the aircraft were suspended from offshore flights by the \nCAA.\n&#xa0;\n1.5.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHSSG was actively involved in liaison with Eurocopter the helicopter manufacturer and the helicopter operators, following the investigation and engaging their own independent experts to assess the findings and the proposed programme of remedial actio\nns.  This included the facilitation of visits by members of HSSG and others to the Eurocopter factory to see manufacture and testing of components at first hand.  A wide range of communication materials were prepared to enable communication with the workfo\nrce and open “town hall” presentations were carried out in Aberdeen.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;1.6&#xa0; \n     Response to the Shetland Crash &#xa0;1.6.1\n              \nWhen the Eurocopter Super Puma L2 crashed on approach to Sumburgh on 23 August 2013, killing four passengers workforce confidence fell even f\nurther.  HSSG took the lead in the response and made the decision to temporarily suspend flying operations of all Super Puma aircraft until more information became available as to the likely cause.  Once it began to become clear that there had been no tech\nnical failure of the aircraft, HSSG was heavily involved in providing information to the workforce, facilitating management visits offshore, heliport and offshore briefings and publishing “Frequently Asked Questions” (FAQs) to keep the workforce informed.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;1.7&#xa0; \n     Establishment of the HTG&#xa0;\n1.7.1\n              \nThe current Helicopter Task Group is a smaller sub-group of HSSG that has been established to provide support to the HSSG in managing the response to the Shetland Helicopter Accident and to ensure that the necessary r\nesource and focus is available to meet the short term workload.\n&#xa0;\n1.7.2\n              \nThe scope of HTG is to:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;1.7.3\n              \nTo date HTG have been preparing monthly newsletters for distribution offshore\n, carried out a briefing to the Step Change Elected Safety Representatives meeting in November and created a series of factsheets describing, amongst other things, how helicopters are certified in respect of evacuation and escape and how the content and qu\nality of offshore survival training and helicopter underwater escape training is overseen at an industry level.\n&#xa0;\n1.7.4    Input has been provided to the CAA review and the Task Group are engaged with the helicopter manufacturer and the manufacturer of pass\nenger survival equipment.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHow Safe are Helicopter Flights?&#xa0;&#xa0;2.1\n              \nHSSG believes that helicopters remain the safest and most efficient way to transport personnel to offshore installations.  However due to their complexity and the conditions in which \nthey operate it is well recognised that, statistically, helicopters have a lower safety performance than large commercial fixed wing aircraft.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nNevertheless, HSSG understands, from statistics published by Oil and Gas UK amongst others, that safety perf\normance in the North Sea leads the rest of the world by some margin, in spite of recent accidents.  HSSG recognises that workforce confidence has been badly shaken by those accidents and that more needs to be done to improve the safety of offshore helicopt\ner operations.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat steps can be taken by industry to improve the  safety of offshore flights?&#xa0;3.1\n              \nHuge improvements in capability and safety performance have been made over the past 30 years or so. Many initiatives from the mandatory use of survival s\nuits to the implementation of improved communications equipment and “virtual radar” systems have been driven by the offshore industry who have supported safety research activities in conjunction with CAA and others.   Modern helicopters also have much impr\noved single engine performance, fault tolerance, avionics and flight information, autopilot capability and flight data monitoring (including Health and Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS)).\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nHowever, HSSG takes the view that there is much more that can be \ndone to improve the consistency with which the full capability of modern aircraft can be used to improve safety of operation.  In contrast with the situation for large fixed wing aircraft, it would seem that individual operators have different ways of oper\nating the same helicopter type, through the use of their own, independently derived, operations manuals. \n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nWe believe that with good co-operation between the helicopter manufacturers and each of the helicopter operators, there is the potential to achie\nve a level of consistency akin to that already present in the commercial fixed wing sector. \n&#xa0;\n3.4\n              \nDirectionally in the long term HSSG sees significant potential to improve safety by modernising the fleet to provide more aircraft with enhanced capabilities \nand safety features, and utilising these to the maximum effect.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHow could legislation and regulations be improved?&#xa0;\n4.1\n              \nHSSG believes that it is important that the high standards achieved by UK (and Norway) are not undermined by lower standards elsewhere\n in Europe.  For example, the requirement to have Vibration Health Monitoring (or HUMS) fitted to aircraft operating offshore is not universal across Europe.  Similarly the CAA have only limited powers of enforcement on aircraft operating within the UK, bu\nt registered elsewhere, and it is important that a “level playing field” is maintained if standards are to be maintained.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5              How effective are existing regulators, including the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in ensuring that recommendations to improve safety are implemented?&#xa0;\n5.1\n              \nHSSG believes that the industry needs a regulator that is competent, professional and properly resourced.  CAA should be seen to be more visible, active and engaged with the offshore industry.  The strength and visibility\n of their immediate response to the Shetland accident was perceived by many to be weak. \n&#xa0;\n5.2\n              \nThe HSSG has no wish to become a pseudo-regulator – this role can only be performed by the UK CAA.\n It is, therefore, critically important for the CAA to assume a \nvery strong leadership role at all times, and to ensure that messaging and directions were clear and unequivocal, especially following incidents and accidents. The operators want to see the CAA offer clearer leadership to ensure the industry respect the re\ngulatory framework established in the UK. \n&#xa0;\n5.3\n              \nOverall the message is one of support for the CAA and for them to take a higher profile role in respect of rotary operations as they have been doing successfully in the UK for fixed-wing operations for many y\nears.\n&#xa0;\n5.4\n              \nThere is concern in the industry that EASA appear to be even more distant, even though they are taking over responsibility for much of the activity previously conducted by CAA.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
