RCH0017 [bold]Written evidence submitted by The Children’s Society’s[bold]Introduction[bold]1.1.
[normal]              
[normal]The Children's Society is a leading national charity, providing vital help to the most vulnerable children, young people and families in our society through a range of services. We work with over 48,000 children each year, supporting them and advocating on their behalf to tackle discrimination or disadvantage in their daily lives. Our priority is children who have nowhere else to turn, such as young refugees, children at risk on the streets, disabled children and children in trouble with the law. We seek to give a voice to children and young people and influence policy and practice so they have a better chance in life.
[normal]1.2.
[normal]              
[normal]Our submission is based on evidence from our research and direct work with looked after children. It is also informed by the joint inquiry into children missing from care by the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for young runaways and missing children and adults and the APPG for looked after children and care leavers that we supported last year. We deliver nine projects working with children who run away or are at risk of being sexually exploited, supporting around a thousand children every year. We have campaigned to protect young runaways through policy, research and practice for over 25 years. We also work with looked after children through nine projects that provide advocacy services, support independent visitors for looked after children and support children in care councils. 
[normal]1.3.
[normal]              
[normal]We welcome this important inquiry by the Education Select Committee looking at whether the proposed reforms to residential children’s homes are sufficient and likely to prove effective, and welcome the opportunity to contribute to the inquiry. 
[normal]1.4.
[normal]              
[normal]We believe that the proposed changes are positive but further steps are needed to ensure that the reforms meet the needs of vulnerable children and are implemented effectively.
[normal]Q: Whether the [bold]DfE’s[bold] proposed reforms to the regulation of residential children’s homes are appropriate and sufficient and whether the reforms are likely to prove effective or further measures are needed. [bold]2.1. 
[normal]              
[normal]We welcome the proposed reforms to the regulation of residential children’s homes. We believe these reforms can contribute to making residential children’s homes safer places and improve protection measures for vulnerable children placed there, such as children who are at risk of child sexual exploitation and children who run away or go missing from care.
[normal]2.2. The proposed reforms address important issues of significant concern that were highlighted by the joint inquiry into children missing from care conducted by the APPG for runaway and missing children and adults and the APPG for looked after children and care leavers. We believe that in order for these changes to be effective, they must form part of a more comprehensive programme of change focussed on improving support for children in care and underpinned by a wider programme of reform to improve placement stability for children in care and to ensure a greater focus on and scrutiny of how the needs of individual children are met.
[normal]2.3.  
[normal]              
[normal]We welcome the requirement for staff working in children’s homes to be adequately trained but recommend that these proposals need to be strengthened further. Staff should be required to obtain qualifications and have adequate training around managing risks, dealing with challenging behaviour and listening to and communicating with children before they are recruited to work in children’s homes. 
[normal]2.4.  
[normal]              
[normal]The focus on children’s homes and children placed out of authority in children’s homes is welcome but we believe that the reforms should be extended to cover children in foster placements, particularly out of authority placements. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5.
[normal]              
[normal]It is important that 
[normal]Ofsted
[normal] have appropriate oversight and monitoring of how the changes are implemented by local authorities through single looked after children and child protection inspection. 
[normal]2.6.
[normal]              
[normal]Children's wishes, views and experiences must have greater prominence in the proposed reforms through improved access to advocacy in statutory reviews and independent return interviews following running away episodes. 
[normal]2.7.
[normal]              
[normal]The specific needs of trafficked children are not adequately considered in these reforms. We believe that the government should implement changes to protect and safeguard these vulnerable children by: establishing a national system of data collection on trafficked children; providing training to staff in residential care homes regarding the indicators of trafficking and how to support trafficked children; developing a system of independent trusted adults to support separated children and ensure that they have their voices heard in decisions that affect them in care and legal processes; and ensuring that these children are placed in appropriate placements that meet their needs.  
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.[bold]              [bold]Achieving placement stability and focus on the needs of the child[bold]3.1. 
[normal]              
[normal]Children in care are extremely vulnerable – just under half of them have been placed in care because of neglect, abuse or trauma.
[normal]1
[normal]  They are three times more likely to run away with an estimated 10,000 going missing from their placements every year.
[normal]2
[normal]  The Department for Education’s (
[normal]DfE
[normal]) Data Pack on children’s home published on 13 September 2013 also shows that these children are more likely to be older young people, have additional needs, such as behavioural, emotional and social difficulties, learning difficulties and more likely to have experienced a larger number of unsuccessful placements and placement breakdown. 
[normal]3.2.
[normal]              
[normal]Placement stability - Research shows that placement stability is one of the key factors that determine positive outcomes for children in care. Findings from our advocacy practice with looked after children shows that more than a third of advocacy cases are focussed on resolving issues related to placements. These include poor quality of placements, safety of placements, frequent and abrupt changes to placements, often without preparation and consultation with children themselves and placements not
[normal] meeting the needs of the child
[normal].
[normal]3
[normal]  Too many placement decisions are still made in an emergency due to a lack of proper placement planning. The APPG inquiry also heard evidence that placement decisions can be based on economic 
[normal]reasons.
[normal]4
[normal] 
[normal] Placements
[normal] that do not meet the needs of the children are more likely to break down. With £1.05 billion spent on residential care it is important that t
[normal]his money is spent effectively 
[normal].
[normal]5
[normal]  
[normal]3.3.
[normal]              
[normal]Placing children’s needs at the centre of care planning - The proposed reforms are likely to have a positive impact on the safety of children’s homes. But they are not likely to be sufficient in ensuring that placement decisions are based on the needs of the child or reducing the number of unsuccessful placements. Our practitioners find that many placements are not adequately meeting the needs of children placed there, particularly if children have additional needs, either related to their previous history of running away, or special educational needs or a disability.

[normal] Jonathan Stanley, Principal Partner for the National Centre for English Residential Child Care and consultant to the Independent Children’s Homes Association, told the inquiry that it is “not always the social worker who makes the decision, but the decision comes from commissioning colleagues in the local authority”. He goes on to say that “We have evidence that cost over care balance is as much as 80:20, often 70:30, and 60:40 is good today”.
[normal]

[normal] Children’s Homes Data Pack, 13th September 2013, DFE
[normal]3.4. The 
[normal]DfE
[normal] data pack on children’s home (September 2013) shows that 46% of children in children’s homes are children in out of authority placements. They are likely to have special educational needs - looked after children are three and a half times more likely to have SEN than other children with a higher prevalence of behavioural, emotional and social difficulties.
[normal]6
[normal]   Children with complex needs require staff with specialist skills to support them in their placements, such as skills to use non-verbal means of communication, or staff with the appropriate level and expertise to support children with behavioural difficulties. Provision for children, especially for children with additional or complex needs, varies considerably from one area to another – some 
[normal]needs can
[normal] be met by placements providers themselves but others require access to local services. Therefore, when a child with additional needs is placed in a children’s home, the children’s home has to be able to provide clear information on how these needs are going to be met, both through the children’s home’s own provision and other services in that area. 
[normal]3.5. Example from our practice: A young person aged 14 in out of authority provision requested advocacy support to resolve issues around his education. In his previous placement he undertook work in Maths and Art towards GCSE level but the coursework was not transferred to the new placement and therefore the young person was unable to complete work towards the qualification. He felt this left him at a great disadvantage in terms of achieving qualifications for his future. The issue could not be resolved informally and so a formal complaint had to be made. The young person said ‘My current placement is supposed to offer in-house education. There are very few provisions in terms of books and work and I am only accessing a limited number of hours of education a day. I would like to complete work towards official qualifications and to have access to more education in terms of hours and support.’ 
[normal]3.6. [bold]              [bold]We believe that the reforms to children’s homes should be underpinned by a wider programme of reform to improve placement stability for children in care and ensuring a greater focus on and scrutiny of how the needs of individual children are met.[bold]3.[bold]              [bold]Attitudes of professionals to older children missing from care and/or at risk of child sexual exploitation (CSE)[bold]4.1. The location of children’s homes and a lack of information sharing between local agencies about the homes and children placed there are important contributory factors to the failure of the system to adequately protect children. We agree that changes to the regulations are needed to address these issues and would make a difference to these vulnerable children. 
[normal]4.2. An additional issue that needs to be addressed, as highlighted by the APPG inquiry and recent cases of CSE, is the negative attitudes of professionals to some vulnerable adolescents. The APPG inquiry received evidence of children in care, particularly those placed in out of authority children’s homes, being targeted for sexual exploitation by predatory adults trying to take advantage of their vulnerability.
[normal]7
[normal]  The inquiry heard that instead of responding to signs of sexual exploitation, professionals perceived young people to be ‘streetwise’, ‘making their own lifestyle choices’, or being ‘troublesome’ rather than children who are in need of help or potential victims of crime.
[normal]4.3. Research evidence suggests that professionals’ perceptions of teenagers as more resilient and able to cope with maltreatment than young children affects how cases of older children are assessed and whether protection is offered to 
[normal]them.
[normal]8
[normal]  The
[normal] Education Select Committee in its report ‘Children First. The Child Protection System in England’ (2012) reported evidence from different organisations that older children are often not treated and assessed the same way as younger children for child protection purposes. There is often a reliance on young people to come forward and disclose abuse even though many young people may not understand that they are in exploitative situations or are reluctant to disclose abuse, as our direct work with young people show.

[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4. We welcome the focus on ensuring that children’s homes’ [bold]staff are[bold] adequately trained and that the government is planning to introduce new requirements for these practitioners.[bold] The issue of inadequate staff qualifications and training has been raised in numerous pieces of research. 
[normal]But we believe that urgent action is needed now to protect vulnerable adolescents who are placed in care of the state.[bold] It is important for current staff in children’s homes to have access to relevant training on the vulnerability of young runaways, the links between missing and sexual exploitation, and positive behavioural management. This can be done through professional development courses that should be made available to children’s homes’ staff immediately and in the future. 
[normal]4.5. We believe that the recruitment and employment for children’s home staff should be subject to minimum qualifications obtained before they start employment. Two years is a long period of time in a child’s life. Considering the vulnerability of children in care, particularly those placed in children’s homes and the variety of support needs they have, it is not acceptable for them to be supported by staff [bold]who[bold] do not have relevant training and qualifications.[bold] Research shows that the current quality of training (or lack of relevant qualifications) is a contributory factor in the failure of some children’s homes to properly safeguard children in their care. Recent cases of child sexual exploitation involving children in care demonstrate this all too well. 
[normal]There should also be an expectation that current employees in the children’s homes sector will obtain the relevant qualifications within the specific time frame of this provision coming into force.[bold]4.6. We welcome the level of detail that children’s homes will be expected to include in the Statement of Purpose[bold] but would recommend that point 5 should also include information on the level of training staff received on positive behaviour management interventions, de-escalation techniques and other approaches that help prevent the need for physical intervention. This should be in addition to information on the home’s approach to restraint and the level of training 
[normal]staff have
[normal] on use of physical interventions.
[normal]4.7. [bold]              [bold]We would also recommend that as part of reviewing whether the child is effectively safeguarded, as outlined in the proposed amendments to Schedule 7 of the Care Planning Regulations, staff responses to children’s behaviour needs to be examined, particularly where a child runs away or displays challenging behaviour.[bold] This would allow them to focus not just on the child’s behaviour and the policies in place but also to address the issue of how confident staff feel in supporting that young person and whether there are any specific training needs for staff that have to be addressed. We believe making this the focus of a review and seeking children’s feedback on their experiences would lead to improvements in staff responses to children.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.[bold]              [bold]Policy and practice in children’s homes [bold]5.1. 
[normal]              
[normal]We agree that it is important for children’s home to have policies in place regarding how to respond to children who run away or go missing and also on how to prevent children going missing from care. We also agree that it is important to share these policies with the local police and ensure that there is a common understanding between care home staff and the police about risk assessments, responding to and reviewing of missing and absent cases. These should be reflected both in children’s homes and police policy on missing and absent children.
[normal]We hear anecdotal examples from our practice that risk assessments done by the police do not always take into account the same factors as risk assessments done by the care home staff. For example, a young person persistently running away from her placement to her mum was reported missing by the care home staff. The young
[normal] person was classified by the police as ‘absent’ despite the fact that there was a child protection order in 
[normal]place and that her mum was of no fixed abode and had a range of mental health and substance misuse issues.
[normal]5.2. 
[normal]              
[normal]At the same time 
[normal]we believe that the primary focus of such policy should be on keeping children who are at risk of going missing from their placement safe. Therefore, this policy should be developed in consultation with young people and agreed with them. Such an approach would empower children to seek help when they need it, reduce the risk of running away and improve relationships between care staff and children.[bold]5.3. 
[normal]              
[normal]We believe that in addition to the procedure to follow if the child goes missing from care these policies should include:
[normal]•
[normal]              
[normal]A commitment to listening to children’s views and an explanation of how this will be met.
[normal]•
[normal]              
[normal]A commitment to develop these policies together with children placed in children’s homes.
[normal]•
[normal]              
[normal]Plans for children’s home staff to raise awareness amongst children placed there of the risks of running away and how to stay safe if they have run away.
[normal]•
[normal]              
[normal]Information for children about where they can seek help when they are not happy, upset or want to raise an issue about the care and support they receive in children’s homes, including the details of independent advocacy services in line with the rights of children to have access to an independent advocate when they want to make a complaint or representation (The Children Act 1989 regulations and guidance, 2010).
[normal]•
[normal]              
[normal]Information for children about the role of the police if a child goes missing and the procedures the police will follow, including arrangements for safe and well checks and return interviews.
[normal]•
[normal]              
[normal]In view of the new police definitions of ‘missing’ and ‘absent’ the policies should provide information on how staff should act if they have concerns about a child and have reported a child missing, including how to escalate the case if there is a disagreement between the children’s home’s staff and the police about possible risks to the child and their classification as ‘absent’.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.[bold]              [bold]Children’s views and wishes[bold]6.1. [bold]              [bold]We also strongly believe that to effectively safeguard and protect children in care local authorities must ensure that  children’s views and experiences are central to child protection responses and processes[bold] as recommended by the Munro review of child protection; ‘...treating children and young people as people not objects requires spending time with them to ascertain their views, helping them understand what is happening to them, and taking their wishes and opinions into account in making decisions about them.’ 
[normal]9
[normal]6.2. [bold]              [bold]Local authorities should ensure that children have access to independent advocates and independent professionals providing return interviews to children who run away from care. Currently access to both services remains very patchy across local areas. Despite statutory guidance requiring local authorities to[bold] provide return interviews to children missing from home or care, in 2011-2012, nine (7%) local authorities did not offer any return interviews to children missing from care. A further 45 (34%) local authorities indicated that they offered return interviews to some children depending on whether they met the criteria. Only a small number of children missing from care actually received return interviews.

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]6.3[bold]. [bold]              [bold]As[bold] recommended by the APPG inquiry into children missing from care, all children missing from care should receive a return interview from a professional they are comfortable speaking and disclosing information to.[bold]6.4. [bold]              [bold]The Children’s Act 1989 Guidance and Regulations should be amended so that all children in care have a statutory right to independent advocacy as part of care reviews and placement planning, not just as part of a complaint process. [bold]6.5. Children and their advocates should be added to the list of people who may request a review in response to concerns that a child is at risk in their placement. [bold]6.[bold]              [bold]Foster placements[bold]7.1.   We believe that children placed with foster carers would benefit from similar changes to those proposed in relation to children’s homes.[bold] This is particularly important in relation to children placed out of authority. The 
[normal]DfE
[normal] statistics indicates that there are around 18,000 foster placements outside 
[normal]council
[normal] borders.
[normal]11
[normal]. Where such placements are made with foster carers, the decision has to be made based on the needs of the child and how well these needs can be met. Foster carers should also be informed about the child’s safety plan and be able to make arrangements to keep the child safe. When a foster 
[normal]carer
[normal] has concerns about risks to a child, such as when a child goes missing, they should be able to request a review of the child’s care plan. 
[normal]7.[bold]              [bold]Trafficked children [bold]8.1. 
[normal]              
[normal]The APPG inquiry into children missing from care highlighted the vulnerability and specific needs of trafficked children in care
[normal]12
[normal]. It is estimated that 60% of suspected victims of trafficking in local authority care go missing
[normal]13
[normal] and almost two thirds of trafficked children are never found
[normal]14
[normal]. The inquiry heard that a lack of awareness of the indicators that a child might have been trafficked combined with a lack of knowledge of the steps to take to prevent trafficked children from going missing leave trafficked children vulnerable to exploitation. 
[normal]8.2.
[normal]              
[normal]Our recent report on trafficked children, that was commissioned by the Home Office and written jointly with the Refugee Council, found that the situation for this group of children has not improved but worsened.
[normal]15
[normal] The legal age changes described in the next three paragraphs do not fall under the remit of this inquiry but, we believe, it is important for the committee to be made aware of these changes that will have detrimental impact on child victims of trafficking accessing the protection they so desperately need. 
[normal]8.3.
[normal]              
[normal]Following cuts to legal aid under the Legal Aid Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (LASPO), child victims of trafficking will be at increased risk because they will no longer be able to access legal aid in their immigration cases unless they have an asylum claim or have been accepted as victims of trafficking by the National Referral Mechanism (NRM). In addition, if the proposed residence test for civil legal aid (under ‘Transforming Legal Aid’) is implemented, we anticipate that many more trafficked children will not be able to access justice: they will be unable to access legal aid even to challenge unlawful decisions by authorities such as the police and local authorities.

[normal]8.4.
[normal]              
[normal]Although the government has indicated that there will be a concession for victims of trafficking, this is unlikely to safeguard the majority of child victims because 65% of child victims of trafficking are not referred to the NRM partly due to a lack of awareness of this system among frontline professionals. This means that prior to an NRM referral and while awaiting the ‘reasonable grounds’ decision, a child victim of trafficking is not able to get legally-aided advice or support from a solicitor unless the case also involves an asylum claim. 
[normal]8.5. Trafficked children are also highly likely to be age disputed. Ten of the seventeen young people we interviewed in our recent research had undergone age assessments
[normal]16
[normal].  The correct assessment of an applicant who is under 18 years of age is necessary to ensure that the government upholds its domestic and international obligations to those who are children. Where an applicant disagrees with the assessment made by a local authority, a judicial review of the decision, and the court's determination of age binds both parties. However, removing the right to access legal aid prior to being referred to the NRM in order to challenge a decision by a local authority will mean trafficked children are in a powerless position where they are unable to challenge an incorrect age assessment and will therefore not be recognised as a child. This means they could remain homeless or be accommodated inappropriately, supported insufficiently, and be placed at risk of harm, detention and deportation.
[normal]8.6.
[normal]              
[normal]The APPG report into children missing from care contained a number of recommendations focussing on the needs of trafficked children. These included calling for: a legal advocate with parental responsibility for all unaccompanied migrant children; a programme of work to meet the needs of trafficked children though child protection frameworks; for police to consider trafficking indicators in missing person’s reports. These recommendations have not been taken forward.
[normal]8.7. [bold]              [bold]We recommend that the government address the needs of trafficked children as part of its ongoing reforms of the care system and implement changes to protect and safeguard these vulnerable children by: establishing a national system of data collection on trafficked children; providing training to staff in residential care on indicators of trafficking and how to support trafficked children; developing a system of independent trusted adults to support separated children and ensure that they have their voices heard in decisions that affect them in care and in legal processes; and ensuring that children are in appropriate placements that can meet their needs.[bold]
