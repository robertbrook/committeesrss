"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by PlaceShapers1.              Background1.1\n              \nPla\nceShapers is a network of over\n 100 community-based housing associations formed in 2008. Between us we own more than 700,000 homes \nand provide \nservices to more than two million people. These include health services, \nsocial care and a range of\n community services. \n1.2\n              \nTogether we complet\ned over 40,000 new affordable homes between 2008 and 2012 and we collectively plan to invest around £5bn\n to deliver a further 32,000\n homes by 2015. As an alliance, our views therefore represent those responsible for over a quarter of the sector’s housing stock. Details of our members and more about what we do can be found on our website: \nwww.pla\nceshapers.org\n \n  \n1.3\n              \nWe are pleased to provide this submi\nssion to assist the\n Committee’s inquiry into the impact of changes in the provision of support to meet housing costs in the reformed welfare system\n. In doing so, we have \nincluded evidence\n from our\n members (some of whom may have made their own submissions to the inquiry) \non the emerging \neffects of changes\n implemented\n. We have also drawn on \nfeedback we provided to CLG and DWP staff in January of this year when invited to discuss our concerns about th\ne planned reforms.\n2.              Our submission2.1\n              \nFor the purposes of your Inquiry, we have limited our su\nbmission to discussion of \nkey issues of particular importance to us\n,\n each of which we return to below. These are:\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe impact of welfare reform on our communiti\nes \n(\nsection 3 below)\n;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \neffect of welfare reform on our \ntenants \n– experience so far \n(\nsection 4 below)\n; \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHow HAs are supporting people into work\n (\nsection 5 below)\n; \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe impact of welfare reform on HA finances and development capacity\n (\nsection 6 below)\n; \nand\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nConcluding comments (section 7 below).\n3.               The impact of welfare reform on our communities3.1\n              \nIt is clear from the feedback we \nhave received that \nthe impact of welfare reform will be\n variable around the country. This is not a surprise to us and reflects the diversity \nof communities, local economies\n and housing markets. W\nhilst we understand that the government will seek \ncomposite headline facts and figures we expect that such data \nmay \nmask the reality of this diversity and would urge continuing attention to the impact at a regional level. \n3.2\n              \nA case in point here is the \n“spare room subsidy” or\n “bedroom tax”. Whilst all HAs report likely adverse impacts on their communities of the refor\nms as a whol\ne, the bedroom tax is of huge\n concern to those in the Midlands, the North and in some rural communities where much of the housing stock comprises larger properties and flexible allocation policies have been promoted by partner LAs. Planned unde\nr-occupation has facilitated long-term residence as families grow as well as securing acceptance of low demand stock –e.g. in high rise blocks – thus reducing v\noid costs. \n3.3\n              \nThe proportion of \nour members’ \ntenants affected by the bedroom tax ranges from \n5\n-20%, the higher levels being in the North where many HAs have several thousand under-occupying households. They will not be able to move tenants who want to downsize due to the scarcity of smaller properties and there is the potential for an oversupply of\n 3Bed + vacancies (with a cons\nequent impact on void\n costs) if new applicants with a strict 2bed need are unable to accept larger properties for financial reasons. This in turn will increase waiting times for smaller properties with an impact on temporary h\nousing costs.\n And where tenants are able to move they may have to move far away from their friends, family and \nsupport networks and also from the schools which their children attend causing great upheaval and isolation.\n3.4\n              \nAn e\nxample here is a Midlands \nho\nusing group with over 600 tenants affected by the bedroom tax and mainly “under-occupying” \n3 bedroom properties. \nThis HA does not have \nlarge families in overcrowded conditions \nwaiting for 3 bedroom homes and such\n properties have now become much harder to\n l\net because the demand in the area\n is now \nlargely for 2 bedroom homes. An analysis of 3-bedroom \nlettings in July 2013 showed that all were let to those with low needs and in some cases it took more than one bidding cycle to allocate any household to these properties at all. \n3.5\n              \nWhilst changes to specific benefits are of concern, our members are equa\nlly worried about the cumulative ef\nfect of\n \nreforms on their residents\n an\nd the blanket application of\n changes across the country\n. Many \nreforms will happen consecutively with the impact of the bedroom tax, benefits cap and consolidated single UC payment hitt\ning people at the same time as they are, for example, \nalso possibly required to pay \ncontribution\ns\n towards council tax or face losing disability payments. This combination of event\ns in addition to the \n1% cap on future benefit uplifts will create significant\n fina\nncial pressures on communities. \nGrowing homelessness as debt related evictions increase with visible signs of acute poverty are inevitable.\n4.              The effect of welfare reform on our tenants – experience so far4.1\n              \nAcross the country our member HAs\n have p\nrepared for welfare reform, assessing the likely impact and developing\n action plans in response. All are in touch with their tenants to develop increasing awareness and \nto offer specialist support. They\n are doing this in a variety of ways including 1:1 con\ntacts, road shows, mailshots, social media campaigns, telephone campaigns, targeting those considered to be in the most vulnerable situations and partnerships with their LAs and other agencies to share experi\nence and good practice. Some\n are working in part\nnership with credit unions to create new jam-jar account facilities and others are taking a lead on efforts to increase digital inclusion. In addition, all of our members are extensively involved \nin worklessness initiatives (see section 5 below\n).\n4.2\n              \nTenant awareness and understan\nding of welfare reform\n and the imp\nlications for them personally remains\n mixed at this stage. The main response of those affected by the bedroom tax appears to be that they will just find ways of paying to stay or will try to o\nccupy their homes to the full. \nEven where tenants are prepared to move, the shortage of available smaller properties means \nthat for most \nthis is unlikely \nwithin \nrealistic timescale\ns\n. A\nnother Midlands\n member reports that it would take around six years to ac\ncommodate their 800 affected customers in smaller homes if they all wanted to move. \nFurthermore, it is \nalready clear that any savings to be made from tenants moving to smaller homes may\n not materialise. For example, \na different member\n confirms that of the \nfew tenants they have helped to\n downsize\n, 12 out of 15 of them are now paying higher rent / service charges – an increase to the exchequer of between £2\n \n-\n \n£14 per week. \n4.3\n              \nThe impact on those who have disabilities is extreme. \nM\nany \nsuch tenants\n live in \nsp\necifically adapted properties and i\nt is practically impossi\nble to transfer them\n to smaller properties because of the nature of their dis\nabilities and resulting\n housing need\n. Our members\n are trying t\no \nhelp \nthese tenants\n stay in their homes, for example by trying to find\n different \nuses for\n ‘spare’ bedrooms\n and maximising \nincomes, but the \nreality is that most \nwill have to find the additional money to cover the housing benefit shortfall\n and will struggle to do so\n.\n4.4\n              \nChanges to Council Tax benefit have compounded the impact of the bedroom tax for some and add\ned an additional household cost\n for those\n not impacted by \nother changes. Local authorities are now free to determine their own council ta\nx benefit scheme but the f\ninancial support available \nhas been cut by 10%. This has left councils with difficult choices and the majority have decided that working age \nhouseholds who previously may have had their council tax bills covered in full will have to pay something. \n4.5\n              \nThe\n result is that we are already seeing tenants get into rent arrears with up to 50%\n of those affected now in debt, including those who \nhad previously always had clear accounts\n.\n \nThis situation we believe can only get worse as additional reforms bite and, cru\ncially, as those lucky enough to have received Discretionary Housing Pay\nments (DHPs) from their LAs find\n this temporary support withdrawn. \n4.6\n              \nOur members have real concerns about the mounting debts \nsuch tenants may accrue and the\n \nimpact on \ntheir families\n, debts that will travel with them through no fault of their own if they do secure a move\n. There is\n \nincreasing evidence of \ntenants being sold \nexorbitantly expensive payday loans and getting into a\nn impossible cycle of debt when\n \nunable to repay these\n. \nThe CAB services with whom our members work locally are already reporting huge increases in demand for debt support and not just in \nareas of traditionally high need. F\nor example\n, a Surrey \nmember reports that their CAB saw a 41% increase in the total debt o\nf those they were helping between 2011/2 and 2012/13 – a jum\np of £2.2m even before the roll-\nout of key \nwelfare reforms. \n4.7\n              \nMany tenants may have unrealistic expectations of how they will manage and are already saying they will go without heat and / or fo\nod to make ends meet. 2,200 families in Knowsley are already known recipients of foodbank donations\n and increasing use of such services is now being reported all around the country\n.\n \n4.8\n              \nThe government \nlays great emphasis on the availabil\nity of DHPs to sup\nport\n vulnerable claimants affected\n by welfare reform. Despite this fund being\n increased, our experience \nis that the demand for\n assistance far outstrips the \navailable payments and \neven where additional support is approved there is no guarantee that this will be maintained in the long term for residents whose complex needs are unlikely to change. Furthermore, \nmany cases involving severe \nhardship are being turned down.\n4.\n9\n              \nOne of our \nSouthern\n members reports that their local council has already spent more on DHP in Q1 than they will be able to budget for in Q2, 3 and 4 and that therefore DHPs will be more difficult to obtain later in the year.\n Other\n LAs appear to be rationing \na\nwards in\n an effort not to use\n the fund too quickly.\n4.10\n              \nA case in point is an\n \nEast-\nbased \nmember\n \nwho reports\n that \nwhilst their LA is supportive they are declining around half of the DHP applications received. \nAn example includes \na se\nverely disabled tenant \nhit by t\nhe underoccupation charge because \na relative was\n caring for her\n son temporarily whilst \nshe \nrecovered\n from a leg amputation\n and awaited\n the fitting of a prosthetic limb. Her\n DHP application was \nturned down because \nshe had taken out a new Sky subscription\n. T\nhe HA helped her appeal this decision on the basis that this supposedly unjus\ntified expense provides an\n essential means of communication (including internet grocery shopping) \nbut was\n again unsuccessful. The \ntenant’s mental health has \ndeteriorated as a \nresult of the\nse\n stress\nful circumstances and she is struggling to cope financially.\n \nThis HA also reports a 25% increase in referrals to the local CAB for specialist debt and money advice.\n4.11\n              \nAnother Midlands\n member reports that \nit has 95\n \nof its most vulne\nrable tenants currently \non DHP \nbut that \nonce \ntheir \nDHP \nawards end – most of which will be in the next two months – these tenants\n will be at serious risk of losing their tenancies as there is no ‘additional’ income available to \ncover the shortfall in housin\ng support\n.  \n5.              How HAs are supporting people into work5.1\n              \nAll of our members are involved in worklessness projects. This has been part of the “day job” for some time. Our own research in 2011 confirmed that just 38 of our members had already helped\n \n10\n,\n00\n0\n young people into\n work. Such support has\n continued with renewed emphasis. \n5.2\n              \nOur members run volunteer schemes to provide valuable work experience, employ apprentices either direc\ntly or in partnership with\n contractors, provide recruitment skills training and support, work closely with local schools, colleges, recruitment agencies and Job Centre Plus and support the growth of new social enterprises. \n5.3\n              \nHowever, despite these efforts and the positive result\ns achieved in some areas, there is continuing concern about the ongoing lack of \nsecure \njobs or additional hours of work. Our experience is that very rarely is being out of work a lifestyle choice.\n6.              The impact of welfare reform on HA finances and development capacity6.1\n              \nOur members are concerned about a range of factors that will impact on their finances negatively and could combine to cause strain on revenue streams, borrowing and developme\nnt capacity. Whilst it \nis difficult to predict \nthe outcome \naccura\ntely at this stag\ne, the HA risk profile has \nchange\nd\n significantly from one of organisations with an assumed “safe” income stream to a future picture reflecting increased uncertainty. \n6.2\n              \nConcerns can be summarised as follows:\n6.2.1\n              \nAn assumed increase i\nn \nrent arrears (which previously \naverage\nd\n \n2-5%) with a doubling of these\n rates in many cases. Significantly, the assumption is that much of this increase will not be easily recoverable and therefore HAs are increasing their business plan provision for bad de\nbts by 1-2%.\n \nFor example, \na Northern\n member reports that of 644 households affected by the bedroom tax, 41% have not been able to make any payment so far towards the shortfall and only 29% have made the payment in full. If thi\ns pattern continues the HA \nsta\nnd\ns\n to lose close to £250k in rental income.\n6.2.2\n              \nThe concerns around housing costs being included in Universal Credit payments \nrather than being paid directly to landlords \nare well documented. \nWe are particularly worried that under UC job seekers \nwho are subject to sanction will lose all their benefits and risk losing their home \ntoo \nwhereas those being sanctioned currently do not lose Housing Benefit.\n We are also concerned that “vulnerable” people who are not living in specialist accommodation will\n be expected to self-determine their vulnerability in order to have their housing costs paid direct to landlords, a requirement that\n is unlikely to protect \nthose most in need of support.\n6.2.3\n              \nIncreased operational costs as HAs take on additional staff (or\n partner with other agencies to do so) to try to mitigate the impact – e.g. welfare advisers, income collection staff and digital inclusion support staff.\n6.2.4\n              \nIncreased transactional costs for rent collection as a result of UC being paid in one sum direc\nt to tenants. Estimates for the increased cost of collecting payments from every individual tenant in receipt of benefit (rather than receiving bulk payments from LAs) range from £50k-£350k per HA.\n6.2.5\n              \nIncreased legal fees for enforcement action with som\ne uncertainty as to how courts will cope with and respond to increased repossession claims.\n6.2.6\n              \nIncreased void turnaround costs due to difficulty in letting unaffordable larger units, increased evictions and many LAs passing on council tax benefit cuts b\ny removing relief on void properties (the impact of which alone was est\nimated as £100k pa by one member\n). \n6.2.7\n              \nReal concern that if rent arrears convert into long-term bad debt this will impact adversely on the \nability to comply with \nloan covenants and c\nash flow with a consequent impact on the financial health of the sector generally. In this light, housing associations will have little sc\nope for leniency regarding \narrears recovery or enforcing repossession orders with an inevitable impact on homelessness\n rates.\n6.2.8\n              \nA\n knock-on effect on development capacity\n resulting from \npredicted increase\ns\n in operational costs and reduced revenues\n. \nFeedback from \nmembers \nsuggests this could mean redu\nctions of up to 15% in development plans\n, equating\n \nto \nalmost\n 5,000 \nnew \nhomes.\n \nLinked to this is a likely \nreduction in the supply of larger properties given concerns that incoming tenants will not be able to cover rent payments.\n6.2.9\n              \nThe \nlikely drying up of the \nsupply of privately leased temporary housing for the homeless, particularly in London where owners are likely to look for tenants able to pay more than the housing benefit cap. \n7.              Concluding comments7.1\n              \nIt is clear from the above that housing association\ns have very real concerns about the \nnegative \nimpact of welfare reform\n on their communities and their own bu\nsiness models. Whilst the full\n impact of \nreforms \nis not yet clear and th\nis \nis \nlikely to vary by region, our members are making prudent adjustments to\n financial plans in order to mitigate the risks and to maximise the support available to affected tenants. \n7.2\n              \nW\ne would \nwelcome any influence that the W&amp;P Select Committee is able \nto \nhave in achieving\n the following:\n7.2.1\n              \nRecogn\nition that the bedroom tax \nis already having\n a significant adver\nse impact and that this is \nparticularly so \nwhere \nthere is not scope for affected househol\nds to downsize\n. \nIn the\n absence of \nthis measu\nre\n being repealed\n (a decision \nwe would\n support), an obvious solution \nis for there to b\ne discretion to waive the tax where lo\ncal housing markets justify\n exemption, a move that would surely be consistent with the Government’s \nlocalism \ncommitment\n.\n7.2.2\n              \nRecognition that the Local Authority DHP scheme is not protecting the most \nvulnerable resid\nents from\n financial hardship and cannot be relied on to do so. \n7.2.3\n              \nContinued g\novernmen\nt action to ensure accelerated broadband \nInternet\n access for our communities, within which 40-60% of residents are currently \ndigitally excluded and recognition by D\nWP \nthat broadband\n payments do not constitute an unnecessary luxury.\n&#xa0;\n7.2.4\n              \nAcknowledgment that HA revenue\n streams are at risk from the\n cha\nnges and that this is \nimpact\ning\n negatively on financial plans and development capacity. Any influence that \nthe Committee \ncan have to mitigate\n these risks is\n welcomed. I\nn particular \nthis should be \nto ensure that the housing element of UC can be paid direct to landlords more quickly and in the longer\n term once arrears are accruing\n.\n T\nhe pilot p\nrojects show\n that tenants \nget into\n \nunmanageable amounts of debt if housing payments cannot revert to landlords until 8 weeks have elapsed. With\n “affordable” weekly rent\ns\n in London not uncommon at £250 it seems irresponsible to wait until a tenant has accrued arrears of over £2k before agre\neing that housing costs can again be paid direct to landlords.\n7.2.5\n              \nAn ongoing commitment to\n learn lessons from the reforms\n and for policy a\nnd practice to be subject to change\n in the light of experience.\n&#xa0;\n27 September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;\n"
