Written evidence submitted by the Community Law Partnership (LAI 0035)default&#xa0;defaultWe would refer to our previous submission to the JCHR Inquiry. 
defaultWe detail here some examples of successful judicial review challenges on behalf of our clients. We believe that, if the Government’s proposals, even in their adjusted form, are brought in, that we will no longer be able to take such challenges because we c
defaultannot afford to run cases ‘at risk’. In those circumstances, the unlawful actions of the local authorities in these case studies will, in future, go unchallenged. This is also in a context where local authorities do change the way they deal with matters in
default the face of such challenges. Thus such challenges lead to better decision making.
