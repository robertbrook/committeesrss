Written evidence submitted by the Community Law Partnership (LAI 0035)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]We would refer to our previous submission to the JCHR Inquiry. 
[normal]We detail here some examples of successful judicial review challenges on behalf of our clients. We believe that, if the Government’s proposals, even in their adjusted form, are brought in, that we will no longer be able to take such challenges because we c

[normal] the face of such challenges. Thus such challenges lead to better decision making.
