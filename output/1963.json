"&#xa0;\nNorth Yorkshire Moors Association – Written evidence&#xa0;\nWe would like the committee to consider some changes to legislation regarding the use of recreational motor vehicles and green lanes. This is an issue which we have experienced first-hand in terms of the damage and disruption to these ancient byways. \n&#xa0;\nWe support the view put forward that:-\n“All unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs), and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads (UCRs) should be recognised as not being part of the ordinary roads network, and should be re-classified as Restricted Byways”\n&#xa0;\nThe second point which has been made and which we support concerns the procedures for imposing Traffic Regulation Orders (TROs) and the way this can conflict with local authority with no means of appeal. Therefore we support the proposal that:-\n&#xa0;\n“When a local authority declines to impose a traffic regulation order the is widely supported by the public, there should be a right of appeal, either to an independent inspector or a magistrate”\n&#xa0;\nFurthermore we fully support the formal submissions put forward by the following organisations.\nThe Green Lanes Environmental Action Group (GLEAM)\nThe Green Lanes Protection Group (GLPG)\nThe peak District Green Lanes Alliance (PDGLA)\nThe Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance (YDGLA)\nTom Chadwick\nChairman North Yorkshire Moors Association\n&#xa0;\n"
