[[[About BASC]]]&#xa0;BASC was founded in 1908 as the Wildfowlers’ Association of Great Britain and Ireland (WAGBI) and is the UK’s largest shooting association.&#xa0; BASC is constituted as an Industrial and Provident Society and has a membership in excess of 130,000.&#xa0; BASC is the largest representative body for sporting shooting in the UK.&#xa0; It aims to promote and protect sporting shooting and the well-being of the countryside throughout the UK and overseas.&#xa0; It actively promotes good firearms licensing practice, training, education, scientific research and practical habitat conservation.&#xa0; BASC believes that all who shoot should conduct themselves according to the highest standards of safety, sportsmanship and courtesy, with full respect for their quarry and a practical interest in wildlife conservation.&#xa0;BASC’s expertise in shooting matters is widely recognised and it is routinely consulted by a variety of government departments, their agencies (and other statutory and non-statutory bodies. &#xa0;BASC represents approximately 165 affiliated wildfowling clubs in the UK with a total membership of around 15,000 individuals.  Wildfowling clubs manage more than a quarter of a million acres of land (104,000 hectares) in the UK, 90% of which is designated as sites of special scientific interest (SSSI).  In England, Wales and Northern Ireland BASC affiliated wildfowling clubs lease some 700km of foreshore from the Crown Estate. &#xa0;Wildfowling is a recreational benefit for local communities and wildfowling clubs provide a focus for wardening of land, monitoring of wildfowl and habitat protection and improvement. The Birds Directive fully recognises the legitimacy of hunting of wild birds as a form of sustainable use. Wildfowling is an activity that provides significant social, cultural, economic and environmental benefits in the UK. &#xa0;In 2004, an estimated 2.6 million work days were undertaken on habitat and wildlife management as a result of shooting in the UK. This is the equivalent of 12,000 Full Time Equivalent jobs.&#xa0;As a result of shooting, £250 million was spent on conservation activities and shooters themselves contributed 2.7 million work days, the equivalent of 12,000 full time jobs.  The total value of sporting shooting to the UK economy in the same year was £1.6 billion.  (Source  2006. PACEC. Economic and Environmental Impact of Sporting Shooting in the UK.  Available online at www.shootingfacts.co.uk ), Given this level of involvement, we hope that developing policy will recognise the important contribution shooting makes to the environment and economy, and that the activities of those involved will not be restricted. &#xa0;

[[[Comments relating to the MCZ process ]]]&#xa0;BASC is fully supportive of marine conservation but would like to highlight the fact that as with terrestrial habitats, it is the industrial or intensive activities that have resulted in the majority of biodiversity loss. In addition, there remains a significant amount of illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing activity still taking place in the UK’s waters. Focussing attention on the regulation of these activities will result in the greatest gains for marine biodiversity.&#xa0;The regulation of MCZs must take account of the current economic conditions and the need for economic growth. It is vitally important that the small businesses that depend on recreational activities like shooting, fishing and water sports are not compromised by regulations that prevent these activities taking place. Government should ensure that the regulation of activities in MCZs reflects the requirements of the Red Tape Challenge and the Regulators’ Code.&#xa0;BASC recommends that features needing protection above the mean low water mark be designated as SSSIs, as these will still be included in the MPA network. This is an area that is usually protected by SSSI legislation. The intertidal area really contains terrestrial features where the policy for identifying, designating and managing terrestrial features through the SSSI system is well understood by Natural England and the stakeholders it works with. By designating terrestrial habitats as MCZs there is a real risk of causing confusion amongst stakeholders about which competent authority they should work with when discussing operations likely to damage the site. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]BASC members currently shoot wildfowl over many existing marine protected areas (SSSI, SPA and SAC). Allowing wildfowlers to continue their sport under the existing consenting process would be consistent with government’s Red Tape Challenge of reducing unnecessary bureaucracy. &#xa0;BASC is surprised to see that there are still proposals for different levels of protection for MCZs, including ‘reference areas where no damaging activities will be allowed’. Reference areas were the most controversial aspect of the Regional MCZ Projects’ recommendations. This comes as no surprise as all other national, European and international conservation conventions and directives recognise the fact that when carried out responsibly, at low levels and sustainably, many recreational activities including hunting (wildfowling) do not compromise conservation objectives. &#xa0;BASC would like to highlight the fact that  the Marine and Coastal Access Act makes no mention of the creation of undisturbed areas that can act as Reference Areas, to compare with other designated sites. Rather, the explicit purpose of the Act is to designate MCZs to conserve marine flora and fauna, marine habitats and features of geological or geomorphological interest. &#xa0;It is BASC’s understanding that there is no basis in the legislation for the establishment of Reference Areas.  Indeed, we consider that the development of Reference Areas should be considered ‘Regulatory Creep’ as it does not accord with the Principles of Good Regulation.  BASC therefore believes that as there is clearly no legal requirement for Reference Areas they should be given no further consideration.  &#xa0;However, should that not be the case then BASC would urge Defra to refer the process under which Reference Areas are being developed, specifically back to the Regulatory Policy Committee. &#xa0;With regard to the management of the 27 MCZs that have been designated so far and those that will be designated in the future, BASC would like to make the following recommendations:&#xa0;Site designation is designed to protect certain features; these must be the focus of protection with a clear list of what activities are likely to cause significant damage to those features. Only activities that are likely to cause significant damage should be considered for regulation. Every attempt should be made to find ways of allowing activities to continue through agreed management plans that address how the activity is compatible with the conservation of the designated feature. &#xa0;It is critical that when designating new sites there is good evidence that shows what the interest feature is and why it is in need of conservation management. There are many English coastal businesses that depend on continued unregulated access to the sea for their success. These include inshore fishing and businesses that support recreational activities. Coastal areas also support many longstanding cultural activities like wildfowling, shore angling and samphire collection. These activities should be allowed to continue when MCZs are designated because of their importance to local communities.&#xa0;&#xa0;9 January 2014&#xa0;&#xa0;3&#xa0;
