"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nGreengauge 21\n (HSR 012)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTable 1 ‘Fundamental Weaknesses’ in the earlier HS2 economic appraisals&#xa0;Issue raised by Castles and Parish for 51MHas the identified issue been addressed in the updated economic case?Inappropriate do minimum\nYes – updated to take into account substantial commitments to enhance existing rail network\nInconsistent ‘base case’ used in HS2 and alternatives\nYes\n – the same base case used throughout \nAlternatives not considered fully\nYes, multiple variants considered by Atkins and compared with HS2 using the same models and economic appraisal techniques\nOut of date assumption on income elasticity of demand\nYes, updated\nUse of over-long appraisal period \nJudgment call. The appraisal period used is consistent with HM Treasury Green Book guidance but with demand growth cut off three years after project opening. How can this be over-long?\nOver-statement of crowding benefits\nYes, t\nrain lengthening investments included in revised base case\nDoubts over validity of reliability benefits\nYes. A lot of new evidence provided on the extent of train punctuality and its relationship with the intensity of network use\nIncorrect value of time that does not reflect the productive use of time while travelling\nYes. Value of business time revised downwards sharply and shown to be consistent with preparedness to pay research that reflects the ability to work while travelling by train\nSubsidy increase across the network unquantified\nYes and now evident that the operating cost of the network (and hence subsidy) is lower with HS2 than without it\nRisk and uncertainty not taken into account\nYes, full probabilistic analysis of BCRs and in treatment of costs\nHigh dependency on long term benefits\nNo. This is an inescapable feature of long term investments\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n(i)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe BCR of the upgrade alternative to the full HSR network, which, as developed by Atkins for DfT showed a higher BCR of 3.1; and\n(ii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe Eddington Report which found, he says, lots of schemes with a higher BCR than 2.3.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“While the [upgrade] packages are likely to be relatively future proof in relation to \ndownside\n risks (where lower demand can be accommodated through reduced crowding and de-scoping of some interventions), there is likely to be \nless scope to address higher demand growth\n, or continued growth beyond the ‘cap year’ (i.e. 2036). Given that, even on the basis of current demand forecasts, peak crowding levels are high, increases in demand would probably require additional capacity to be found.\nThere is scope within the existing packages, particularly for MML, ECML and Cross Country, to provide \nsome\n extra capacity through train lengthening but there is more limited scope to increase capacity through frequency enhancements without further considerable infrastructure investments. Discussions in \nthis study did not identify any obvious further infrastructure investments which were likely to boost capacity and offer value for money\n.”\nThe Eddington ReportComparison with other successful major transport schemes&#xa0;&#xa0;\nThe Capacity Case&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNorth South imbalance&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Benefits across the nation&#xa0;&#xa0;\nConclusion&#xa0;&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n http://www.greengauge21.net/general/hs2-the-critics-answered/\n See Peter Hall in Built Environment Volume 39 Number 3 \nHigh-Speed Rail: Shrinking Spaces, Shaping Places \np343 for a useful summary of these objections.
