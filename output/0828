Written evidence from the Health Foundation (LTC 78)default&#xa0;default1default.0default              defaultExecutive summarydefault&#xa0;
default1.1
default              
defaultThe Health Foundation is an independent charity working to improve the quality of healthcare in the UK. Informed by our research and improvement programmes, this submission of evidence 
defaultconsiders 
defaultthe ability of the NHS to ‘
defaulttreat the patient
default as a person’
default and recommends changes
default needed to deliver high quality, person-ce
defaultntred care for people with long-
defaultterm conditions.
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default              
defaultThe NHS has only a very limited ability to deliver person-centred care for people with 
defaultlong-term
default conditions.
default 
defaultThis is because p
defaultatients are largely viewed by clinicians as passive recipients of care and few are supported to develop the skills, confidence and behaviour to effectively manage their conditions. Furthermore, the 
defaultway that the health system is structured and its processes are organised poses a barrier to more person-centred care.
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default              
defaultThe 
defaultvast 
defaultmajority of care for a person with 
defaultlong-term
default conditions is delivered by the individual patient themselves
default because they are living with their condition every day
default. 
defaultIt is therefore essential that 
defaultimprovement of health services 
defaultis 
defaultfocused upon supporting people 
defaultto effectively manage
default their own conditions.
default&#xa0;
default1.4
default              
defaultThere must be
default 
defaultchanges to the roles, mindsets and behaviours of patients and clinicians, supported by processes and infrastructure that enable a new relationship of partnership between people and health professionals.
default&#xa0;
default1.5
default              
defaultTo make the rhetoric of person-centred care a reality, action is required by clinical com
defaultmissioning groups, NHS England 
defaultand those bodies with influ
defaultence on
default the education and training of health professionals.
default&#xa0;
default2default.0default              defaultWhat defaultis person-centred care and why is it important?default&#xa0;
default2
default.1
default              
defaultCoordinated, community-based services are important, but not 
defaulton their own 
defaultsufficient, to deliver sustainable and effective care for people with 
defaultlong-term
default conditions
default. 
defaultThere needs to be a fundamental change in how government a
defaultnd the NHS think
default about care for people with 
defaultlong-term
default conditions. 
default&#xa0;
default2
default.
default2
default              
defaultIt is vital that the improvement of 
defaultlong-term
default conditions management is focused on the role patients themselves can play in effectively managing their conditions. On average, a person with a 
defaultlong-term
default condition spends just three hours each year in contact with a health professional, and that contact does not always coincide with the periods of time when an individual most needs support. 
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default              
defaultPerson-centred care 
defaultshould
default 
defaultsupport people to self-manage, offer personalised care planning and enable people to share in decision making
default.
default It should
default 
defaultuse the 
defaultlimited time patients
default 
defaultspend wi
defaultth a health professional 
defaultto
default:
default enable patients to become knowledgeable, confident managers of their health
default; 
defaultsupport
default people
default with 
defaultlong-term
default conditions
default to make informed decisions about and 
defaultto 
defaultsuccessfully manage their own
default,
default health and 
defaultcare
default; 
defaultdeliver
default care that is responsive to people’s individual abilities, preferences, lifestyles and goals.
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default              
defaultDespite the promotion of these approaches by government and health policy leaders
default,
default truly person-centred care has not spread beyond core innovators. The ability of the NHS to “treat the patient as a person” is far too limited.
default 
default&#xa0;
default2
default.
default5
default              
defaultCreating this person-centred health system
default requires different roles, behaviours and mindsets from clinicians and 
defaultpatients, supported by processes and infrastructure that
default enable new relationship
defaults
default.
default 
defaultHealth professionals need to view people as partners in their care, rather than passive recipients. They need to understand the motivations and challenges that each 
defaultindividual faces in adopting healthy behaviours – not just the biomedical challenges, but psychological and social challenges as well. 
default&#xa0;
default2.6
default              
defaultThis requires 
defaulta 
defaultfundamental shift
default in how health services are delivered, with the emphasis moving 
defaultfrom
default focusing on improving clinical outcomes 
defaultto
default quality of life, 
defaultfrom
default providing specialist treatment 
defaultto
default generic support, and 
defaultfrom
default a system that reacts to people’s ill health to one that focuses proactively on enabling people to live as healthily as possible.

default&#xa0;default4default.0default              defaultBarriers to person-centred caredefault&#xa0;default4
default.1 
default              
defaultThe b
defaultarriers to person-centred care are lar
defaultgely cultural and arise
default 
defaultfrom
default the
default 
defaultthree key participants
default in healthcare:
default health professionals, patients
default and 
defaultorganisational processes
default.
default 
default&#xa0;default4
default.
default2
default              
defaultHealth professionalsdefault.
default 
defaultThe a
defaultttitudes, beliefs and behaviours ingrained in 
defaulthealth professionals
default limit their ability to provide effective, person-centred
default care
default. 
defaultBarriers include
default the following
default: 
default&#xa0;
default4
default.2.1
default              
default‘
defaultWe already do that.
default’
default 
defaultThere is a lack of a clear, shared understanding about what effective person-centred care looks like. When urged to participate in our programmes, many health professionals said they already are supporting their patients to self-manage or ar
defaulte using shared decision making.
default 
defaultBut after training sessions, many realised that they had not be
defaulten using a truly person-centred 
defaultapproach.
default&#xa0;
default4
default.2.2
default              
default‘
defaultThere isn’t enough time.
default’
default A common response to our programmes was that health professionals felt they had too much to do and no time to participate in training or 
defaultto 
defaultengage in self-management support and shared decision making. Clinicians also feared that 
defaultthe approaches would
default lengthen the time of consultations.
default 
default&#xa0;
default4
default.2.3
default              
defaultHealth professionals lack understanding about the value of involving patients in design and delivery.
default In Co-creating Health, for example, lay tutors sometimes found that 
defaulthealth professionals
default questioned the role 
defaultpatients 
defaultcould play in clinician training. 
default&#xa0;
default4
default.2.4
default              
defaultHealth professionals are not taught 
defaultskills necessary for person-centred support.
default Our programmes found that few health professionals are equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to understand what motivates their patients and support them to change behaviours
default.
default&#xa0;
default4
default.
default3
default              defaultPdefaultatientsdefaultIndividuals with 
defaultlong-term
default conditions may have a poorer quality of life, lower levels of support from social networks, and less confidence in their ability to manage their health than people without 
defaultlong-term
default conditions.
default Barriers include
default the following
default:
default 
default&#xa0;
default4
default.3.1
default              
defaultPatients l
defaultack of 
defaultknowledge, skills, and 
defaultconfidence
default to effectively manage their
default own
default health
default. 
defaultBeing diagnosed with a 
defaultlong-term
default condition is a life-changing event which may involve changes in lifestyle and 
defaultrequire new

default, for example,
default medicines management
default. 
default&#xa0;

default 
defaultFeelings of deference

defaultor in 
defaulta new kind of consultation
default in which they act as partners with clinicians in planning and making decisions about their care.

defaultealthcare delivery 
defaultsystems – including the services that are commissioned, 
defaultoperational systems and financial incentives 
default– can 
defaultbe 
defaultbarriers 
defaultto 
defaultperson-centred care
default.
default These barriers include the following
default:
default&#xa0;
default4
default.4.1
default              
defaultPatients lack access to a range of services that fit their individual needs and abilities.
default 
defaultP
defaultroviding information 
defaultalone is not enough
default to support people with 
defaultlong-term
default conditions
default. 
defaultPeople need p
defaultroactive support 
defaultto 
defaulthelp 
defaultthem
default develop 
defaultthe 
defaultconfidence
default,
default 
defaultskills and knowledge to manage their health and care
default.
default&#xa0;
default4
default.4.2
default              
defaultCommissioners lack an understand
defaulting of person-centred care and ‘
defaulthow to get 
defaultit
default’
default.
default 
defaultCommissioners who gave insights for Co-creating Health recognised the role of self-management support in reducing pressure on services. However, their understanding of effective self-management support was mixed and some were unsure about how to commission it.
default&#xa0;
default4
default.4.3
default              
defaultIT systems can prevent easy access and flow of information
default. 
defaultFor example, one Co-creating Health team faced the problem of GPs using different IT systems, which prevented them from flagging patients participating in the 
defaulttraining 
defaultprogramme. 
default&#xa0;
default4
default.4.4
default              
defaultL
defaultack of access to test results or 
defaultother 
defaultinformation 
defaultin advance of 
defaulta consultation
default.
default Our systems are designed to give test results or information about treatment options during the consultation
default, which hinders agenda setting, care planning and shared decision making within allotted consultation times.
default 
default&#xa0;
default4
default.4.5
default              
defaultTariffs are not always aligned to provide self-management support.
default In our shared haemodialysis project
default,
default 
defaultfor example, 
defaultp
defaulteople with kidney disease
default learnt
default to self-administer dialysis in hospital, gaining ind
defaultependence and freeing up staff.
default Patients use button hol
defaulting – a means 
defaultto self-administer dialysis
default –
default but the tariff acts as a disincentive because the needles 
defaultnecessary 
defaultare more expensive than
default the
default sharp
defaulter
default needles used in staff-administered dialysis. 
default&#xa0;default5default.0default              defaultWhat we have learneddefault about how to overcome these barriersdefault&#xa0;default5
default.1
default              
defaultCreating a culture that supports person-centred care is a significant challenge
default. 
defaultOur programme teams 
defaulthave 
defaulthad to be creative and
default flexible to overcome barriers.
default Support from senior leadership – up to trust board levels –
default has been vital in 
defaultgaining traction.
default 
default&#xa0;
default5
default.2
default              
defaultChanging culture defaultand behaviours defaultamong health professionalsdefaultHealth professionals need education, training, and development that gives them 
defaultthe 
defaultknowledge and 
defaultskills 
defaultrequired 
defaultfor person-centred care.
default 
defaultThe Health Foundation has learnt the importance of
default the following
default:
default&#xa0;
default5
default.2.1
default              
defaultEncouraging participation in training
default.
default Getting health professionals to participate in training required clearly setting out the benefits of self-management suppo
defaultrt and shared decision making. 
defaultTo address time concerns, t
defaulteams had to adapt training, in some cases shortening the programme or offering mi
defaultni-training
default sessions
default to support staff. 
defaultThose
default who participated found that using shared decision making and agenda setting helped to structure con
defaultsultations
default.
default&#xa0;
default5
default.2.2
default              
defaultTraining whole teams
default. 
defaultCo-creating Health found it important to train whole teams of health professionals from the same service, so that everyone involved had a common understanding of self-management support and its tools and techniques.
default 
default&#xa0;
default5
default.2.3
default              
defaultEnsuring health professionals have the right skills.
default 
defaultTraining involved role playing as well as education in support techniques such as motivational interviewing and coaching skills, which are key to helping patients build confidence.
default 
default&#xa0;
default5
default.3
default              
defaultChanging culture and behaviours among patientsdefaultPatients who attended Co-creating Health group sessions had, on average, become more motivated and confident to self-manage.
default 
defaultAs one person who took the course said: 
default‘
default[I]t galvanised me, it got me going.
default 
defaultI think I pulled myself out of a hole and decided that I was going to do it.
default 
defaultLike the lay person [tutor], she’d obviously taken charge of her illness, and I thought well I can do that, I’m not a wimp
default’.
default 
defaultOur programme
defaults
default helped overcome 
defaultpatient 
defaultbarriers in the following ways
default:
default&#xa0;
default5
default.3.1
default              
defaultEncouraging participation in patient training.
default Co-creating Health found that patients sometimes needed encouragement from a trusted source – especially their GP – 
defaultto prompt them to participate in a training programme.
default&#xa0;
default5
default.3.2
default              
defaultOffering activities
default that build confidence
default.
default 
defaultCo-creating Health 
defaultoffered biomedical, psychological and in some cases socia
defaultl support through peer support.
default Group sessions included goal setting, problem solving, and relaxation, as well as condition-specific training such as self-monitoring or managing pain. Lay and clinical tutors used techniques such as positive psycho
defaultlogy, motivational interviewing
default and helping people identify unhelpful beliefs. 
default5
default.3.3
default              
defaultAdapting to patients’ needs and preferences
default. Teams 
defaultsometimes
default 
defaultchanged 
defaultthe length 
defaultor content of sessions to suit patients
default. 
defaultThey developed creative ways to promote and carry out self-management support, such as through practice-b
defaultased resource libraries or text 
defaultmessages to follow up on goals.
default5
default.3.4
default              
defaultInvolving patients in design and delivery of training sessions
default. Several project managers found that involving pati
defaultents in the design, development
default and implementation of the programmes was vital to meet patients’ needs b
defaultecause the patient perspective ‘could not be imagined’
default by professionals.
default&#xa0;
default5
default.3.5
default              
defaultPromoting peer support
default.
default Peer support at some sites also helped motivate people to engage. Peer support activities ranged from regular phone calls with a 
default‘
defaultbuddy
default’
default, reunions for those who had participated in training together, and a peer-led walking group.
default&#xa0;
default5
default.4 
default              
defaultChanging systemsdefaultWhole system change is needed to integrate person-centred care into care pathways. More work is needed at all levels to investigate and consider what systems or tariffs 
defaultare
default supporting or
default hampering person-centred care.
default 
defaultO
defaultur programme teams made some progress
default in this
default with help 
defaultfrom 
defaulttheir wider organisations.
default Progress included the following
default:
default 
default&#xa0;
default5
default.4.1
default              
defaultDeveloping tools and support for clinicians
default. 
defaultSome teams developed agenda-
defaultsetting sheets to help patients identify what they want from a consultation, confidence rulers to help assess the likelihood of a behaviour change and health plans to capture patients’ commitments to their actions. Other
default teams developed electronic templates
default 
defaultto prompt clinicians and
default help structure consultations.
