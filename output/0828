Written evidence from the Health Foundation (LTC 78)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1[bold].0[bold]              [bold]Executive summary[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1
[normal]              
[normal]The Health Foundation is an independent charity working to improve the quality of healthcare in the UK. Informed by our research and improvement programmes, this submission of evidence 
[normal]considers 
[normal]the ability of the NHS to ‘
[normal]treat the patient
[normal] as a person’
[normal] and recommends changes
[normal] needed to deliver high quality, person-ce
[normal]ntred care for people with long-
[normal]term conditions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]              
[normal]The NHS has only a very limited ability to deliver person-centred care for people with 
[normal]long-term
[normal] conditions.
[normal] 
[normal]This is because p
[normal]atients are largely viewed by clinicians as passive recipients of care and few are supported to develop the skills, confidence and behaviour to effectively manage their conditions. Furthermore, the 
[normal]way that the health system is structured and its processes are organised poses a barrier to more person-centred care.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]vast 
[normal]majority of care for a person with 
[normal]long-term
[normal] conditions is delivered by the individual patient themselves
[normal] because they are living with their condition every day
[normal]. 
[normal]It is therefore essential that 
[normal]improvement of health services 
[normal]is 
[normal]focused upon supporting people 
[normal]to effectively manage
[normal] their own conditions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4
[normal]              
[normal]There must be
[normal] 
[normal]changes to the roles, mindsets and behaviours of patients and clinicians, supported by processes and infrastructure that enable a new relationship of partnership between people and health professionals.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5
[normal]              
[normal]To make the rhetoric of person-centred care a reality, action is required by clinical com
[normal]missioning groups, NHS England 
[normal]and those bodies with influ
[normal]ence on
[normal] the education and training of health professionals.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2[bold].0[bold]              [bold]What [bold]is person-centred care and why is it important?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal].1
[normal]              
[normal]Coordinated, community-based services are important, but not 
[normal]on their own 
[normal]sufficient, to deliver sustainable and effective care for people with 
[normal]long-term
[normal] conditions
[normal]. 
[normal]There needs to be a fundamental change in how government a
[normal]nd the NHS think
[normal] about care for people with 
[normal]long-term
[normal] conditions. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal].
[normal]2
[normal]              
[normal]It is vital that the improvement of 
[normal]long-term
[normal] conditions management is focused on the role patients themselves can play in effectively managing their conditions. On average, a person with a 
[normal]long-term
[normal] condition spends just three hours each year in contact with a health professional, and that contact does not always coincide with the periods of time when an individual most needs support. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]              
[normal]Person-centred care 
[normal]should
[normal] 
[normal]support people to self-manage, offer personalised care planning and enable people to share in decision making
[normal].
[normal] It should
[normal] 
[normal]use the 
[normal]limited time patients
[normal] 
[normal]spend wi
[normal]th a health professional 
[normal]to
[normal]:
[normal] enable patients to become knowledgeable, confident managers of their health
[normal]; 
[normal]support
[normal] people
[normal] with 
[normal]long-term
[normal] conditions
[normal] to make informed decisions about and 
[normal]to 
[normal]successfully manage their own
[normal],
[normal] health and 
[normal]care
[normal]; 
[normal]deliver
[normal] care that is responsive to people’s individual abilities, preferences, lifestyles and goals.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal]              
[normal]Despite the promotion of these approaches by government and health policy leaders
[normal],
[normal] truly person-centred care has not spread beyond core innovators. The ability of the NHS to “treat the patient as a person” is far too limited.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal].
[normal]5
[normal]              
[normal]Creating this person-centred health system
[normal] requires different roles, behaviours and mindsets from clinicians and 
[normal]patients, supported by processes and infrastructure that
[normal] enable new relationship
[normal]s
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Health professionals need to view people as partners in their care, rather than passive recipients. They need to understand the motivations and challenges that each 
[normal]individual faces in adopting healthy behaviours – not just the biomedical challenges, but psychological and social challenges as well. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6
[normal]              
[normal]This requires 
[normal]a 
[normal]fundamental shift
[normal] in how health services are delivered, with the emphasis moving 
[normal]from
[normal] focusing on improving clinical outcomes 
[normal]to
[normal] quality of life, 
[normal]from
[normal] providing specialist treatment 
[normal]to
[normal] generic support, and 
[normal]from
[normal] a system that reacts to people’s ill health to one that focuses proactively on enabling people to live as healthily as possible.

[normal]3
[normal].1
[normal]              
[normal]This submission of evidence is informed by the 
[normal]Health Foundation
[normal]’s improvement programmes and research, and focuses primarily upon our learning about how to effectively implement self management support and shared decision making.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]              
[normal]Starting in 2007, t
[normal]he Health Foundation’s 
[normal]Co-creating Health
[normal] (CCH) 
[normal]improvement programme 
[normal]worked 
[normal]for five years 
[normal]with several NHS sites
[normal] 
[normal]to demonstrate the best ways to redesign routine care so that patients are well support
[normal]ed
[normal] to manage their 
[normal]long-term
[normal] conditions.
[normal] It featured
[normal] training programmes for patients and health professionals 
[normal]and 
[normal]a 
[normal]service 
[normal]improvement programme. 
[normal]Four sites have now been given additional funding which they will be using over the next two years to continue to embed self management in their services.
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]              
[normal]The Health Foundation’s 
[normal]Making 
[normal]Good Decisions in Collaboration (MAGIC)
[normal] 
[normal]improvement programme 
[normal]has been exploring how clinical services can support patients to share in decision making.
[normal] 
[normal]MAGIC 
[normal]has not been tested
[normal] specifically
[normal] 
[normal]in the context of 
[normal]long-term
[normal] conditions,
[normal] but
[normal] is relevant because people with 
[normal]long-term
[normal] conditions are faced with care and treatment options.

[normal]3.5
[normal]              
[normal]The research we draw on in this submission includes our syntheses
[normal] of the evidence bases for self-
[normal]management support and shared decision making
[normal] 
[normal]and
[normal] an exploration of the interaction between patients and clinicians during the consultation
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4[bold].0[bold]              [bold]Barriers to person-centred care[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4
[normal].1 
[normal]              
[normal]The b
[normal]arriers to person-centred care are lar
[normal]gely cultural and arise
[normal] 
[normal]from
[normal] the
[normal] 
[normal]three key participants
[normal] in healthcare:
[normal] health professionals, patients
[normal] and 
[normal]organisational processes
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4
[normal].
[normal]2
[normal]              
[normal]Health professionals[bold].
[normal] 
[normal]The a
[normal]ttitudes, beliefs and behaviours ingrained in 
[normal]health professionals
[normal] limit their ability to provide effective, person-centred
[normal] care
[normal]. 
[normal]Barriers include
[normal] the following
[normal]: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].2.1
[normal]              
[normal]‘
[normal]We already do that.
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal]There is a lack of a clear, shared understanding about what effective person-centred care looks like. When urged to participate in our programmes, many health professionals said they already are supporting their patients to self-manage or ar
[normal]e using shared decision making.
[normal] 
[normal]But after training sessions, many realised that they had not be
[normal]en using a truly person-centred 
[normal]approach.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].2.2
[normal]              
[normal]‘
[normal]There isn’t enough time.
[normal]’
[normal] A common response to our programmes was that health professionals felt they had too much to do and no time to participate in training or 
[normal]to 
[normal]engage in self-management support and shared decision making. Clinicians also feared that 
[normal]the approaches would
[normal] lengthen the time of consultations.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].2.3
[normal]              
[normal]Health professionals lack understanding about the value of involving patients in design and delivery.
[normal] In Co-creating Health, for example, lay tutors sometimes found that 
[normal]health professionals
[normal] questioned the role 
[normal]patients 
[normal]could play in clinician training. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].2.4
[normal]              
[normal]Health professionals are not taught 
[normal]skills necessary for person-centred support.
[normal] Our programmes found that few health professionals are equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to understand what motivates their patients and support them to change behaviours
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].
[normal]3
[normal]              [bold]P[bold]atients[bold]Individuals with 
[normal]long-term
[normal] conditions may have a poorer quality of life, lower levels of support from social networks, and less confidence in their ability to manage their health than people without 
[normal]long-term
[normal] conditions.
[normal] Barriers include
[normal] the following
[normal]:
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].3.1
[normal]              
[normal]Patients l
[normal]ack of 
[normal]knowledge, skills, and 
[normal]confidence
[normal] to effectively manage their
[normal] own
[normal] health
[normal]. 
[normal]Being diagnosed with a 
[normal]long-term
[normal] condition is a life-changing event which may involve changes in lifestyle and 
[normal]require new 
[normal]competenc
[normal]ies
[normal] in
[normal], for example,
[normal] medicines management
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].3.2
[normal]              
[normal]Patients feel 
[normal]‘
[normal]doctor knows best
[normal]’
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Feelings of deference
[normal] or anxiety
[normal] toward
[normal]s
[normal] health professionals 
[normal]made
[normal] some 
[normal]patients 
[normal]reluctant to engage in 
[normal]training 
[normal]programmes 
[normal]or in 
[normal]a new kind of consultation
[normal] in which they act as partners with clinicians in planning and making decisions about their care.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].
[normal]4
[normal]              [bold]Organisational processes[bold]H
[normal]ealthcare delivery 
[normal]systems – including the services that are commissioned, 
[normal]operational systems and financial incentives 
[normal]– can 
[normal]be 
[normal]barriers 
[normal]to 
[normal]person-centred care
[normal].
[normal] These barriers include the following
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].4.1
[normal]              
[normal]Patients lack access to a range of services that fit their individual needs and abilities.
[normal] 
[normal]P
[normal]roviding information 
[normal]alone is not enough
[normal] to support people with 
[normal]long-term
[normal] conditions
[normal]. 
[normal]People need p
[normal]roactive support 
[normal]to 
[normal]help 
[normal]them
[normal] develop 
[normal]the 
[normal]confidence
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]skills and knowledge to manage their health and care
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].4.2
[normal]              
[normal]Commissioners lack an understand
[normal]ing of person-centred care and ‘
[normal]how to get 
[normal]it
[normal]’
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Commissioners who gave insights for Co-creating Health recognised the role of self-management support in reducing pressure on services. However, their understanding of effective self-management support was mixed and some were unsure about how to commission it.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].4.3
[normal]              
[normal]IT systems can prevent easy access and flow of information
[normal]. 
[normal]For example, one Co-creating Health team faced the problem of GPs using different IT systems, which prevented them from flagging patients participating in the 
[normal]training 
[normal]programme. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].4.4
[normal]              
[normal]L
[normal]ack of access to test results or 
[normal]other 
[normal]information 
[normal]in advance of 
[normal]a consultation
[normal].
[normal] Our systems are designed to give test results or information about treatment options during the consultation
[normal], which hinders agenda setting, care planning and shared decision making within allotted consultation times.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].4.5
[normal]              
[normal]Tariffs are not always aligned to provide self-management support.
[normal] In our shared haemodialysis project
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]for example, 
[normal]p
[normal]eople with kidney disease
[normal] learnt
[normal] to self-administer dialysis in hospital, gaining ind
[normal]ependence and freeing up staff.
[normal] Patients use button hol
[normal]ing – a means 
[normal]to self-administer dialysis
[normal] –
[normal] but the tariff acts as a disincentive because the needles 
[normal]necessary 
[normal]are more expensive than
[normal] the
[normal] sharp
[normal]er
[normal] needles used in staff-administered dialysis. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5[bold].0[bold]              [bold]What we have learned[bold] about how to overcome these barriers[bold]&#xa0;[bold]5
[normal].1
[normal]              
[normal]Creating a culture that supports person-centred care is a significant challenge
[normal]. 
[normal]Our programme teams 
[normal]have 
[normal]had to be creative and
[normal] flexible to overcome barriers.
[normal] Support from senior leadership – up to trust board levels –
[normal] has been vital in 
[normal]gaining traction.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal].2
[normal]              
[normal]Changing culture [bold]and behaviours [bold]among health professionals[bold]Health professionals need education, training, and development that gives them 
[normal]the 
[normal]knowledge and 
[normal]skills 
[normal]required 
[normal]for person-centred care.
[normal] 
[normal]The Health Foundation has learnt the importance of
[normal] the following
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal].2.1
[normal]              
[normal]Encouraging participation in training
[normal].
[normal] Getting health professionals to participate in training required clearly setting out the benefits of self-management suppo
[normal]rt and shared decision making. 
[normal]To address time concerns, t
[normal]eams had to adapt training, in some cases shortening the programme or offering mi
[normal]ni-training
[normal] sessions
[normal] to support staff. 
[normal]Those
[normal] who participated found that using shared decision making and agenda setting helped to structure con
[normal]sultations
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal].2.2
[normal]              
[normal]Training whole teams
[normal]. 
[normal]Co-creating Health found it important to train whole teams of health professionals from the same service, so that everyone involved had a common understanding of self-management support and its tools and techniques.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal].2.3
[normal]              
[normal]Ensuring health professionals have the right skills.
[normal] 
[normal]Training involved role playing as well as education in support techniques such as motivational interviewing and coaching skills, which are key to helping patients build confidence.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal].3
[normal]              
[normal]Changing culture and behaviours among patients[bold]Patients who attended Co-creating Health group sessions had, on average, become more motivated and confident to self-manage.
[normal] 
[normal]As one person who took the course said: 
[normal]‘
[normal][I]t galvanised me, it got me going.
[normal] 
[normal]I think I pulled myself out of a hole and decided that I was going to do it.
[normal] 
[normal]Like the lay person [tutor], she’d obviously taken charge of her illness, and I thought well I can do that, I’m not a wimp
[normal]’.
[normal] 
[normal]Our programme
[normal]s
[normal] helped overcome 
[normal]patient 
[normal]barriers in the following ways
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal].3.1
[normal]              
[normal]Encouraging participation in patient training.
[normal] Co-creating Health found that patients sometimes needed encouragement from a trusted source – especially their GP – 
[normal]to prompt them to participate in a training programme.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal].3.2
[normal]              
[normal]Offering activities
[normal] that build confidence
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Co-creating Health 
[normal]offered biomedical, psychological and in some cases socia
[normal]l support through peer support.
[normal] Group sessions included goal setting, problem solving, and relaxation, as well as condition-specific training such as self-monitoring or managing pain. Lay and clinical tutors used techniques such as positive psycho
[normal]logy, motivational interviewing
[normal] and helping people identify unhelpful beliefs. 
[normal]5
[normal].3.3
[normal]              
[normal]Adapting to patients’ needs and preferences
[normal]. Teams 
[normal]sometimes
[normal] 
[normal]changed 
[normal]the length 
[normal]or content of sessions to suit patients
[normal]. 
[normal]They developed creative ways to promote and carry out self-management support, such as through practice-b
[normal]ased resource libraries or text 
[normal]messages to follow up on goals.
[normal]5
[normal].3.4
[normal]              
[normal]Involving patients in design and delivery of training sessions
[normal]. Several project managers found that involving pati
[normal]ents in the design, development
[normal] and implementation of the programmes was vital to meet patients’ needs b
[normal]ecause the patient perspective ‘could not be imagined’
[normal] by professionals.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal].3.5
[normal]              
[normal]Promoting peer support
[normal].
[normal] Peer support at some sites also helped motivate people to engage. Peer support activities ranged from regular phone calls with a 
[normal]‘
[normal]buddy
[normal]’
[normal], reunions for those who had participated in training together, and a peer-led walking group.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal].4 
[normal]              
[normal]Changing systems[bold]Whole system change is needed to integrate person-centred care into care pathways. More work is needed at all levels to investigate and consider what systems or tariffs 
[normal]are
[normal] supporting or
[normal] hampering person-centred care.
[normal] 
[normal]O
[normal]ur programme teams made some progress
[normal] in this
[normal] with help 
[normal]from 
[normal]their wider organisations.
[normal] Progress included the following
[normal]:
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal].4.1
[normal]              
[normal]Developing tools and support for clinicians
[normal]. 
[normal]Some teams developed agenda-
[normal]setting sheets to help patients identify what they want from a consultation, confidence rulers to help assess the likelihood of a behaviour change and health plans to capture patients’ commitments to their actions. Other
[normal] teams developed electronic templates
[normal] 
[normal]to prompt clinicians and
[normal] help structure consultations. 
[normal]A
[normal]dministrative staff 
[normal]members were trained
[normal] to 
[normal]h
[normal]elp get information out before consultations. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal].4.2
[normal]              
[normal]Creating access to h
[normal]ome-based solutions that promote independence
[normal]. 
[normal]A
[normal] 
[normal]Health Foundation 
[normal]projec
[normal]t has 
[normal]offered diabetes foll
[normal]ow-up consultations by web-cam.
[normal] Patients reported that, compared to face-to-face appointments, web consultations s
[normal]aved time, were more convenient
[normal] and 
[normal]that they 
[normal]would be more likely to attend them.
