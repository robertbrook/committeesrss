[normal])
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]London TravelWatch submission to the Transport Select Committee inquiry into Cycle Safety[bold] - [bold]December 2013[bold]London 
[normal]TravelWatch is the statutory watchdog representing all transport users in London. London TravelWatch has a particular remit regarding Transport for London’s (TFL’s) road network, the TLRN. London TravelWatch wants to see cycling policies and programmes dev
[normal]eloped in the wider context of how London’s streets are used by all Londoners and all transport modes.
[normal]Cycling is an important and growing transport mode in London. Although growth is at present from a low base, cycling has much greater importance in Londo
[normal]n than in most other parts of the UK. Increasing the modal share for cycling has benefits for both the individual and for London’s transport system as a whole as cycling can be both space and energy efficient. If London is to continue to grow and have a tr
[normal]ansport system with less crowding, congestion and unreliability it is important that cycling should be promoted The Mayor’s 400% increase on 2011 levels by 2026 is an ambitious target.
[normal]In 2009 we published a report, 
[normal]Cycling
[normal] in London
[normal]. This was produced fol
[normal]lowing consultation with many stakeholders in London. We surveyed the views of cycling groups, walking groups, representatives of those with disabilities, motorcycling groups, traffic engineers, borough cycling officers and transport planners. Additionally
[normal], we have participated in the Metropolitan Police
[normal] Services
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal]( MPS’
[normal])
[normal] Strategic Traffic Forum and now sit on TfL’s Cycle Safety Working Group (CSWG) and the London Transport Community Safety Partnership (LTCSP). London TravelWatch members regularly hear from
[normal] and debate traffic and transport issues with TfL and other statutory organisations, such as the City of London Police who have innovated on roads policing through their Operation 
[normal]ATRIUM
[normal]. Members and officers are in regular dialogue with user groups, in v
[normal]arious fora, representing a wide cross section of Londoners. Officers have taken part in TfL’s CRISP
[normal] rides and have undertaken accompanied rides with TfL looking at the first of the two pilot Superhighways
[normal]. 
[normal]In developing our policies we have sought to take into account all users of London’s streets. We recognise the increasing role of ‘place’. London TravelWatch gives particular priority to the modes that use scarce street space most efficiently: walk, cycle 
[normal]and
[normal] 
[normal]bus.
[normal]London TravelWatch’s priorities for cycle safety[bold]Awareness, education and roads policing[bold]Improving the skill levels of cyclists in order that they can control the space around them, understand the dangers, reduce risky behaviour and cycle conside
[normal]rately on London’s roads is a key priority. We want to see more cyclists take training. This could be achieved by either marketing or by exchanging training sessions for Fixed Penalty Notices as is done by the City of London Police as part of their operati
[normal]on 
[normal]ATRIUM .
[normal]The recent MPS operation, SAFEWAY, 
[normal]that
[normal] is targeting all road users both in terms of educating users and enforcing traffic law, is very welcome. London TravelWatch is a strong advocate of a higher level of roads policing. This would include ope
[normal]ration ATRIUM type activity, more of the MPS operation FOIST
[normal] and speed enforcement.  The targeting of HGVs using operation FOIST techniques would seem worth trialing given the number of non-compliances found with HGVs as part of the precursor operation to
[normal] the MPS’s operation SAFEWAY.
[normal]TfL is presently running some excellent road safety campaigns   that have messages developed in conjunction with many stakeholders.
[normal] They seek to improve understanding of all road users of one another and of safe and risky beha
[normal]viour.
[normal] These should both continue and be developed in light of the response to them and any best p
[normal]ractice that becomes available.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Engineering measures[bold]London TravelWatch strongly favours data-led interventions on London’s streets. The clamour for ‘cycling
[normal] infrastructure’ may well lead to poorly targeted schemes that do not take into account all users and do not properly allocate limited resources where they will be most effective. For example the cycle superhighway between Stratford and the Bow roundabout 
[normal]junction along Stratford High Street has resulted in the loss of a bus priority lane for London’s busiest bus
[normal], route 
[normal]25.
[normal] 
[normal]There are also proposals, as part of this 
[normal]scheme, that
[normal] in the name of cycle safety, introduce cyclists onto the pavement and introduce 
[normal]additional kerbs. Pedestrians, particularly elderly, and mobility and visually impaired users want level and continuous pavements, not kerbs
[normal]. They
[normal] 
[normal]dislike
[normal] cycling on the pavement, because of the actual and perceived safety risks that cyclists pose for them
[normal].
[normal]Most casualties occur at busy road junctions. For this reason road safety specialists have historically focussed their efforts at these locations. London TravelWatch 
[normal]believes this should continue and particularly welcomes 
[normal]TfL’s  junctions’
[normal] review which t
[normal]argets those locations with a history of collisions. 
[normal]However, there are conflicting policies for London’s streets. There is policy to maintain and enhance motor vehicle capacity whilst at the same time a policy to re-model junctions to be safer for cyclin
[normal]g. It is difficult to see how
[normal], in any practical sense,
[normal] these conflicts can be resolved without the more widespread implementation of roads pricing to reduce vehicle volumes. 
[normal]London TravelWatch considers that there is much scope to improve the safety of cy
[normal]clists on London’s streets through a variety of engineering changes that minimise any detrimental impact on other users such as:

[normal]Slower speeds in residential areas, 20mph zones; speed tables etc.;

[normal]Side road entry treatments to slow turning movements;

[normal]Wide inside lanes and bus lanes (operational for longer periods of the day, ideally 24/7) that would allow cyclists to pass wide vehicles more safely and wide vehicles to pass cycles more s
[normal]afely;
[normal]5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The reversion of gyratory road systems to two-way operation;
[normal]6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The introduction of point road closures to dramatically reduce the volumes of traffic. This would have an area wide impact. This is also known as filtered permeability. 
[normal]There is an assump
[normal]tion that on-carriageway cycle lanes provide some benefit to cyclists. However they are problematic insofar as they discourage the adoption of a good cycling position as taught by cycle trainers who suggest cyclists should take a more central position than
[normal] a cycle lane would imply. The provision of cycle lanes can lead to motorists gesturing or hooting at cyclists that adopt a correct and safe position. Cycle lanes may give a false sense of security.

[normal] Operation ATRIUM is an education and enforcement campaign led by the City of London Police.
[normal] CRISP – Cycle Route Implementation and Stakeholder Plan. This is part of TfL’s develop
[normal]ment procedures for implementation of cycling schemes.
[normal] Operation FOIST was a large scale, multi-agency operation conducted by the MPS to tackle all types of crime associated with motor vehicles
[normal]. Large numbers of illegally operated motor vehicles were rem
[normal]oved from the roads of east London’s streets. This continues, but at a smaller scale as operation CUBO.
