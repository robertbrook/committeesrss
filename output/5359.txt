[[[ by the Chartered Institute of Taxation]]]

[[[ (DWB 16)]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The Chartered Institute of Taxation (CIOT) is pleased to submit some general comments on the draft Wales Bill that we hope will be of assistance to the Welsh Affairs Committee. We restrict our comments to taxation matters, our area of expertise. We would be pleased to amplify our comments orally or in writing if that would be helpful and we look forward to engaging with the Welsh Government as the taxation matters dealt with by the Bill are developed. This short paper sets out:&#xa0;Probably the key point we would wish to make is that developing fully operational devolved taxes will take considerable time and resources. That may seem an obvious point but the timescales involved and the resources needed must not be underestimated. &#xa0;

[[[The Chartered Institute of Taxation]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The CIOT is the leading professional body in the United Kingdom concerned solely with taxation. The CIOT is an educational charity, promoting education and study of the administration and practice of taxation. One of our key aims is to work for a better, more efficient, tax system for all affected by it – taxpayers, their advisers and the authorities. The CIOT’s work covers all aspects of taxation, including direct and indirect taxes and duties. &#xa0;2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The CIOT draws on our members’ experience in private practice, commerce and industry, government and academia to improve tax administration and propose and explain how tax policy objectives can most effectively be achieved. We also link to, and draw on, similar leading professional tax bodies in other countries. The CIOT’s comments and recommendations on tax issues are made in line with our charitable objectives: we are politically neutral in our work.&#xa0;3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The CIOT’s 17,000 members have the practising title of ‘Chartered Tax Adviser’ and the designatory letters ‘CTA’, to represent the leading tax qualification. 

[[[The Low Incomes Tax Reform Group]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Through our Low Incomes Tax Reform Group (LITRG), the CIOT has a particular focus on improving the tax system, including tax credits and benefits, for the unrepresented taxpayer. LITRG is an initiative of the CIOT to give a voice to the unrepresented, ie those who cannot afford to take professional advice. Since 1998 LITRG has been working to improve the policy and processes of the tax, tax credits and associated welfare systems for the benefit of those on low incomes.

[[[Key principles for taxation]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Welsh Government has a real opportunity to design the devolved taxes in line with proper principles. We think the Welsh Affairs Committee could usefully emphasise the importance of these principles in its report.&#xa0;6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We think there are four key principles to be borne in mind in the design of tax systems:

[[[Consultation]]]&#xa0;7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We are firm believers in the benefits of proper consultation. The point is to get practical input into the development of new tax law. More subtly, a key benefit is that consultation will make taxpayers and advisers more supportive of the law if they have been involved with its development. &#xa0;8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We are very supportive of the UK Government’s framework for tax consultations as set out in ‘Tax Policy Making: a new approach’. Its principles parallel our views on what makes effective consultation, views we have put forward many times over the years:&#xa0;9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The guiding principle must be that all tax policy changes are consulted on. The main exception would be changes in tax rates. We do accept that changes in rates are always going to be a matter for government and would not normally be susceptible to consultation, though there have been instances where the implications of what seemed to be rate changes would have emerged with consultation. &#xa0;10&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We would be happy to supply fuller comments about consultation, including reflections on our experience of the consultative process, if that were helpful. 

[[[Stability]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]11&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A stable tax system – one that changes only when it needs to – is an important part of the business environment. Investment is encouraged if businesses have confidence in the way the returns from their investment will be taxed. One of the conclusions of the Office of Tax Simplification’s (OTS) first project on small business was that the greatest source of complexity for small business is change. &#xa0;12&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Ideally taxes should be underpinned by a proper framework – key aims for the tax and principles under which it will operate. For the government, the overriding point is to promote confidence in the tax system. That delivers benefits as taxpayers (business and individual) are more likely to comply with their responsibilities.

[[[Certainty]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]13&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Stability promotes certainty and many businesses put certainty at the top of their list of what a tax system needs to deliver. They want to know what the result of their actions will be in tax terms. For this reason, retrospective changes to tax laws are very damaging and should be avoided: another benefit of consultation, to ‘get it right first time’.&#xa0;14&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; One manifestation of certainty is that taxes should be laid down clearly in statute. In today’s complex environment, guidance notes by the tax authority will often be necessary, particularly for the unrepresented. But such material should be explanations, assistance and guidance, not a way for the tax authority to interpret (or even worse, change) the law to how it thinks it should operate. Citizens should be taxed by law, not by guidance, nor untaxed by concession.

[[[Simplicity]]]&#xa0;15&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Taxes should as far as possible be expressed in clear law and be simple to operate. Administrative burdens on taxpayers should be minimised. When developing new tax laws, it should be part of the planning process to develop the necessary compliance routines and draft the relevant forms to test out the likely burdens that will be imposed and how easy it will be to comply. &#xa0;16&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It should be borne in mind that it can be more cost-effective in some cases for the central authority to carry out aspects of the administration on a central basis, rather than devolve the work to taxpayers. That said, we accept that in transaction taxes, those taxpayers who are liable should expect to shoulder most of the compliance burden.&#xa0;17&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; One issue to consider under this heading is the place of digital procedures. In general we support the idea of ‘digital by default’: that in today’s environment, digital communication (e-filing, online intelligent forms, information being available on line etc) should be the norm. But it should not be compulsory: regard must be had to the ‘digitally excluded’. LITRG has a particular interest in this area. This is not solely an issue for individuals; many small businesses still rely on ‘traditional’ methods. In developing tax laws, the Welsh Government needs to have regard to how these groups should be catered for.

[[[Some comments on ]]]

[[[Welsh ]]]

[[[tax proposals]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]18&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A substantial part of the draft Wales Bill covers taxation powers. The taxes to be devolved to the Welsh Government are as devolved to Scotland and follow from the Silk Commission proposals. The CIOT made submissions to the Silk Commission and we support the ways in which these proposals have been developed. 

[[[Welsh rate of income tax]]]&#xa0;19&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The decision to allow the Welsh Government a single rate of income tax rather than the varied rates as suggested by the Silk report introduces the same system as in Scotland. Although this is clearly a very important matter of principle, we think the real work now has to start in terms of how the tax will actually be managed and collected. From our work over the Scottish rate of income tax (SRIT), we think that key issues are:&#xa0;20&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The proposals in new s116D-G of the Governance of Wales Act 2006 parallel the equivalent Scottish provisions for defining who is liable to the new tax and correctly build on the new UK Statutory Residence Test. The aim has to be that the vast majority of people can easily ascertain whether they will be Welsh taxpayers (or not) and are sure of their position. Work will be needed over practical issues, such as people who travel regularly between Wales and England for work. &#xa0;21&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There has been constructive engagement with HMRC over various technical matters relating to SRIT. Not all are fully resolved. Examples include tax relief for pension contributions and gift aid donations, and such matters as PAYE settlement agreements. We think it is important that rules and practices for the Welsh and Scottish rates on income tax are in step: it would be administratively inefficient – as well as confusing for some taxpayers and employers – if there were definitional differences. &#xa0;22&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A major issue that needs to be tackled is that of communication: making sure the right messages are conveyed to taxpayers. Taxpayers may easily have a variety of misconceptions about the implications of the new tax system. As implementation approaches, there needs to be a carefully designed programme of communication to taxpayers explaining who is affected, their responsibilities and the implications, plus of course how to get additional help and explanations. This will need proper resourcing.&#xa0;23&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We have regularly pointed out the need to consider demands on employers (and pension providers) in tax changes. A key example is the extent to which employers will need to give information about Welsh tax on payslips: the point being that plenty of time needs to be allowed for employers and software suppliers to develop necessary systems. It needs to be borne in mind that it will not just be Welsh businesses that will have to operate the Welsh rate of income tax.

[[[Devolving Stamp Duty Land Tax]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]24&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Consideration should be given to adopting a progressive rate system for the successor Welsh tax to remove the market distortions created by the current SDLT ‘slab’ system. In the context of the residential property market, the effect of the SDLT ‘slab’ system (under which the rate of SDLT applies to the whole consideration once a threshold is reached) is widely recognised as creating market distortions with bunching around the price thresholds and creating avoidance opportunities (see the case of Orsman v HMRC in 2012, where an allocation of just £800 to garage fittings was enough to reduce the SDLT by £5,200).&#xa0;25&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In order to minimise uncertainty, particularly in the commercial property market, it is important that any inevitable uncertainty over likely future design and rates of the new tax is kept to a minimum. This includes the approach to anti-avoidance rules where there will need to be a balance struck between the desire to guard against avoidance and creating complex rules and uncertainty. Delays in doing so may lead to investment decisions being delayed or directed elsewhere.&#xa0;26&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There are challenging and problematic aspects of SDLT such as the provisions relating to leases, partnerships and trusts. In designing the new tax, there is a clear opportunity to consult on simplifying the complex aspects of SDLT. We think it is important that sufficient time is built into the legislative timetable to allow for consultation. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]27&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The current SDLT online return is overly complex and inflexible to change. Registers of Scotland are currently developing a simplified online Land and Buildings Transaction Tax return. The Welsh Government may wish to consider a similar approach. Irrespective of the arrangements adopted for collection of devolved taxes, the costs of administration, at least in the longer term, should be reduced if the Welsh Government can construct a less complex tax than its SDLT predecessor with a simplified online return.&#xa0;

[[[Welsh Landfill tax]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]28&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A key aim must be to tax what is actually discarded into landfill, not simply what enters the site. The tax structure needs to encourage recycling.

[[[Revenue Wales and a ]]]

[[[Tax ]]]

[[[Management Bill]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]29&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A significant matter is how the new taxes are run: a separate tax authority or by HMRC as agent for the Welsh Government. We assume the former will be the case, thus an organisation parallel to Revenue Scotland will need to be established. That will take time and resource.&#xa0;30&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There will also be a need to develop a taxes management system that can cover all the taxes likely to be devolved to Wales. Ideally tax management provisions should be common across all taxes, with difference only where the nature of the tax requires differences.&#xa0;

[[[How the CIOT can contribute]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]31&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Both the CIOT and LITRG operate across the UK with an extensive and active branch network including our South Wales Branch. We employ a number of Technical Officers who coordinate and distil input from around 300 of our members who volunteer their time on our various technical committees. Many more of our members volunteer their time to help with Education, Branches and Professional Standards activities. &#xa0;32&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Our contributions to consultations and general discussions therefore draw on the knowledge and experience of both our members in practice and the in-house technical team. With LITRG we have many links to wider groups who have an interest in tax matters. &#xa0;33&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The CIOT has had significant involvement with the development of the Scottish tax system and would be able to draw on that experience in contributing to the development of Welsh tax proposals. Submissions that we have made on Scottish tax proposals have regularly drawn on surveys of our members in practice in Scotland. We have also used mediums such as round tables, conference sessions, webinars and articles in Tax Adviser magazine to disseminate information and discuss issues. We would be pleased to work with the Welsh Government to make use of these avenues to discuss tax matters, particularly around practical implications of proposals.
