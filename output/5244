[normal]In Afghanistan,
[normal] Persons with disability, Recent War Victims, Landmine Survivors 
[normal]both men/women and children live
[normal] in
[normal] extreme
[normal] poverty hav
[normal]ing
[normal] 
[normal]very limited
[normal] skills and education 
[normal]which 
[normal]segregated
[normal] 
[normal]them from job, comprehensive education because of their disability and inadequate support.
[normal]Persons with disability
[normal] have 
[normal]very little
[normal] capacity for competition 
[normal]in the 
[normal]job markets
[normal] with those who has no disability with quality of
[normal] 
[normal]their
[normal] educations
[normal].  According to the 
[normal]recent information from the 
[normal]Ministry of Labour Social Affairs Martyrs and Disabled (MoLSAMD) , there are 
[normal]680000[bold] Six Hund
[normal]red Eighty thousand persons
[normal] living 
[normal]with disability as consequence of 
[normal]from War, Landmine , UXO, Suicide Attack and Accidents.
[normal] There is no public survey conducted 
[normal]in Afghanistan for the exact number of P.W.D, 
[normal] 
[normal]but random survey indicated that there are more than 3 million
[normal] people living with 
[normal]different type
[normal]s
[normal] of disability including the above War victims figures.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In Afghanistan, 
[normal]Persons with disability especially women /children 
[normal]are not aware of their social, political and economic rights
[normal] because, there are still no comprehensive services available for 
[normal]P.W.D
[normal].
[normal] neither from government and 
[normal]nor from the 
[normal]International community such as UN and others stakeholders.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]The government of Afghanistan has 
[normal]5% 
[normal]employment quota and law for 
[normal]employment of the 
[normal]persons with disability but 
[normal]it 
[normal]is not implemented so far due to discrimination, neglecting of disability and 
[normal]lack of financial and 
[normal]human resources.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan officially ratifies the 
[normal]UN-
[normal]CRPD Convention but it is not put in to practice yet. AOAD is very keen in the implementation of the CRPD Convention along with the Afghan law for the 
[normal]well-being
[normal] of P.W.D, recent war victims and others in the country.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Persons with disability are challenged with 
[normal]Physical
[normal] barrier 
[normal]also
[normal] very limited rehabilitations
[normal] facilities available only in the main provincial capital. U
[normal]nemployment and barrier to education 
[normal]confront access barriers on a daily basis
[normal] for equal participation 
[normal]their life 
[normal]is not improved yet
[normal].
[normal] There is general agreement that 
[normal]financial support for collection of 
[normal]better data
[normal] with implementation is 
[normal]required to provide a basis for action and policy to address challenges to access
[normal] comprehensively
[normal]. However, basic prevalence data do not provide guidance to those who seek to dismantle barriers, and there is a lack of 
[normal]empowered disability organization 
[normal]because, currently they are 
[normal]lacked shortage of 
[normal]funding
[normal] for such activities for disability development activities 
[normal]in Afghanistan to proceed with data collection
[normal] 
[normal]and analyst the situation and improve
[normal] the
[normal] activities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Situation of Rehabilitation of persons with disability in Afghanistan:[bold]Thousands of persons with disability both women/men and children lacked mobility problems there is no wheelchairs distribution
[normal] free of charges
[normal] including the crutches
[normal]. I
[normal]CRC has producing every month
[normal] around
[normal] 27 wheelchairs but
[normal] it
[normal] is only for their registered patients.
[normal]Healthcare of persons with disability is a challengeable issue in Afghanistan. There are no free medical systems for free and accessible medical or surgery treatment for persons with disability only ICRC has some facilities but they 
[normal]are only operating
[normal] mainly in Kabul, Mazar, Jalalabbad, Hirat. Theses provinces cannot say yes to the solution of the whole Afghanistan
[normal] people with disability
[normal]. ICRC has no limitation from others provinces
[normal] they say yes to any Afghan with disability,
[normal] but for persons with disability 
[normal]it 
[normal]is difficult 
[normal]for coming from one province
[normal] or far district to another long distance due to their poverty it is difficult to afford the expensive rent of bus with huge challengeable physical accessibility before receive artificial limbs or outhouses.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Employability of persons with disability in Afghanistan:[bold]Employment is an 
[normal]parts of the life for every one
[normal] also it is basic rights
[normal] 
[normal]of the human being,
[normal] but people with disability are the poorer of the poor because, of their 
[normal]haven
[normal]-gone skills due to their disability
[normal], discrimination
[normal] and
[normal] lacked
[normal] skills
[normal] prevent them 
[normal]from
[normal] work
[normal] in the labor market
[normal] lacked unemployment
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]In Afghanistan, 
[normal]Persons with disability is always the last
[normal] to
[normal] be hired and the first to being 
[normal]discharges.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Sustainability: [bold]Steps toward the elimination of all the above problems will be prevent
[normal]ing
[normal] through sustainable development activities for inclusion of persons with disability in the job markets and providing equalizations are the followings:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Needs assessments 
[normal]survey 
[normal]for persons with disability with 
[normal]data 
[normal]collection 
[normal]with
[normal] interest
[normal] of P.W.D for interest
[normal]able

[normal] for 
[normal]sustainable jobs
[normal].

[normal]Improvement of the physical accessibility with Ramps constructions and adaptation of classes and doo
[normal]r
[normal] steps
[normal] schools
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] [bold]DFID [bold]activities [bold]in Afghanistan[bold]:[bold]As far as I know DFID
[normal] in Afghanistan,
[normal] they are spending
[normal] for supporting the government,
[normal] and
[normal] also providing
[normal] 
[normal]huge support
[normal] to 
[normal]International Organization as implementing partners for developmental and humanitarian’s
[normal] affair
[normal]. For Afghan disabled people NGOs,
[normal] 
[normal]they have very limited support to persons with disability in Afghanistan.
[normal] I several time knocked the door of DFID in Afghanistan
[normal],
[normal] they
[normal] only
[normal] said that we are supporting the International Organizations not have so far plan to support local NGOs. 
[normal]There are very limited NGOs running by persons with disability 
[normal]working 
[normal]for 
[normal]the 
[normal]mission and vision to support persons with disability
[normal] in Afghanistan
[normal]. I
[normal]n the present context
[normal], many of the Afghan disabled people organization are collapsed
[normal] due to the 2014
[normal] alarm of the media. 
[normal] 
[normal]The Afghan government has no systems to support the 
[normal]Afghan 
[normal]CSOs, DPOs and NGOs
[normal]. Several Afghan NGOs working for persons with disability has 
[normal]shortage of
[normal] funding for 
[normal]their 
[normal]activities and administrative support 
[normal]because;
[normal] the 
[normal]donor’s
[normal] agencies are not interesting to support disability development activities
[normal] in Afghanistan because, it is not related to politics
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]DFID must take the responsibility to capacit
[normal]at
[normal]e the Afghan NGOs for expandable support to persons with 
[normal]disability
[normal] in the following systems:
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Mainstreaming disability as top agenda
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Providing long term developmental project with sustainable mission and vision

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Enhance disability equality
