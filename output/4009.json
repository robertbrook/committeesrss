"BRC37\n&#xa0;\nSubmission from Paul WicksMy name is Paul Wicks and I have been a full scope electrician for over 25+ years and I work in the Domestic, Commercial and Industrial sector.\nI have seen a lot of changes over the years but since the introduction of Part P there has been a massive \nincrease of company’s that have grown on the back of Part P.\nI was a member of an electrical scheme operator for 5 years from June 2008 to June 2013 and I was assessed once when I joined and then NEVER EVER assessed again and yet I paid my scheme fee’s eve\nry year which has an assessment fee built in.\nI have qualifications that were gained through a college course that was just short of 4 years long, I also have Inspection &amp; Testing and the current electrical 17\nth\n edition, this I feel is the minimum \nstandard\n that an electrician should have to be classed as an electrician as with the years at college teach you the fundamental basics of electricity.\nOne of the massive increases I have seen is these 6 week courses that have flooded the market since Part P, this \nhas to end before someone is seriously injured or worse killed as you cannot learn to be an electrician in 6 weeks.\nI have watched the government talks where you address the money making schemes that have ripped off genuine tradesmen for a long long time, \nI feel it would be a better path to make to scrap all schemes and bring a ONE government monitored scheme that I know I would join, I feel that nearly all electricians would join this ONE scheme as the general public and tradesmen are confused by the vario\nus registers and schemes that have flooded the market since Part P.\nIn short get rid of the schemes and have one government monitored scheme.\nTo join this scheme you need to have all the qualifications that are needed with the core courses covered in a col\nlege at least one day a week for 3 years.\nIn the long run you will have qualified electricians carrying out electrical work. \nIf the government were to make it a legal requirement to get the rental market to have their electrics checked every year like gas\n has to be then the safety will increase in homes across the country.\nThank you for taking the time to read this\n3 December 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
