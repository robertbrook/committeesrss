"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written evidence from t\nhe Confederation of Passenger Transport UK (CPT)\n (WRT 004)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nThe Confederation of Passenger Transport UK (CPT) welcomes the opportunity to provide evidence to the Transport Select Committee for their inquiry into \nwinter resilience in transport. CPT would \nbe happy to provide f\nurther information \nif it would assist the Committee.  \n&#xa0;Following the inclement winter of 2009/10 where substantial parts of the country failed to cope with the pressures the extreme weather placed upon it CPT \nparticipated in and \nprovi\nded evidence to the DfT report led by David Quarmby and also the report conducted by the Local Government Association. \n Our \nevidence \nshowed \nthat where the \nHighways Agency and local authority\n \nh\nighways departments had worked in partnership to plan a \ncoordinated response to decide what level of bus services\n could \nbe provided\n,\n and concentrated on delivering that plan\n,\n bus services in those \nareas were \nbetter than where they had been no \ncoordination and \na \nrather \nhaphazard response by local authorities and\n their road gritting teams. There is now an acknowledgement that roads around bus depots need to be part of the priority gritting routes if bus services \nare to be maintained \neven when the depots are located in industrial estates and away from main roads.\n&#xa0;\nSince then \nCPT \nha\ns\n asked a number of \nits\n members across the country whether there has been any improvement in communications between the local authorities and the bus companies to draw up winter resilience plans to decide how both parties will react \nshould\n \nsnow and ice \ndevelop \non the local bus network. The responses have been mixed across the country\n.  F\nor example\n,\n \nNorthumbria\n and Arriva now meet more regularly to decide what bus routes they will try to keep operational in a priority order\n,\n whereas \nin \nDerby\n and Derbyshire \nbus routes have dropped off the priority roads list\n.\n The position in \nBristol\n has improved dramatically\n.\n \nBristol City Council and First have agreed on the main roads and bus routes the council will treat as priority routes for gritting and t\nhis plan is scheduled for review each October. \n&#xa0;\nThe bus companies have also made a number of changes with many now geared up to getting the latest information out to customers through their websites, social media, local radio etc.\n&#xa0;\nThere is general concer\nn that this winter, \ndue to budgetary constraints\n,\n \nl\nocal \na\nuthorities may not be able to provide the level of gritting services they have in previous years and \nthat \nthis may impair \nthe ability of \nbus compan\nies\n to provide the same levels of services\n.\n The posi\ntion\n,\n of course\n,\n will not be known \nunless and \nuntil extreme weather arrives this winter. \n However, \nCPT expects that at the very least the dialogue on winter resilience plans will continue between local authorities and the bus companies even if only a very \nlimited response is available by the local authority\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013 \n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n"
