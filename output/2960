[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Written e[bold]vidence from the Department for Transport[bold] (SRN 008)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Questions[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Investment[bold]1.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The commitments 
[normal]we 
[normal]made in the Spending Review constitute the biggest ever upgrade of our 
[normal]existing 
[normal]strategic national roads network, tripling annual investment on major roads enhancements from today’s level to over £3bn by 2020/21.
[normal]1.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This 
[normal]will allow us to address the backlog o
[normal]f repairs and deliver a world-class road network that can meet our future needs, transforming performance by 
[normal]improving connectivity, capacity and journey reliability
[normal].
[normal]1.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Investment can also enhance the standard of safety for road users. Our safest roads are t
[normal]hose where we’ve already invested – where junctions are safe, where dual carriageways 
[normal]and motorways 
[normal]take much of the risk out of overtaking and where surfaces and alignments 
[normal]reflect
[normal] modern
[normal] standards
[normal]. For example improving 
[normal]busy 
[normal]at-grade junctions to 
[normal]grade-separated standard would not only mean better flowing traffic but potential safety improvements of 25%-50%.
[normal]1.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In 
[normal]Action for Roads 
[normal]we made clear that a
[normal]ny improvements to the network will need to be made in a way that supports our
[normal] quality of life and sustainability
[normal] outcomes. This means that our vision for roads must 
[normal]b
[normal]e designed to minimise environmental impacts and also address existing problems. The scale of investment which we intend to deliver means that we can afford to invest 
[normal]in environmental safeguards. Greater use of measures such as tunnels, green bridges, noise mitigation
[normal] and measures to control air quality impacts
[normal], means that there 
[normal]does not need to be 
[normal]a stark choice between a well-functioning road network and a well-protec
[normal]ted environment
[normal].
[normal]1.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We will build on and expand existing cooperation with environmental and other 
[normal]bodies
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]roads 
[normal]investment 
[normal]will 
[normal]be accompanied by an aggressive policy of decarbonisation, to address the carbon consequences of motoring and move us to a lowe
[normal]r-impact future.  
[normal]1.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Government has made an unprecedented long-term commitment to speeding the transition to low emission motoring in the 
[normal]UK
[normal], including the goal of seeing every car on the 
[normal]UK
[normal]’s roads effectively zero emission by 2050.  
[normal]Action for Roads 
[normal]committed an additional £500m to support the switch to the latest ultra-low emission vehicles
[normal], 
[normal]which builds upon existing funding and the
[normal] £1 billion
[normal] 
[normal]of joint industry and g
[normal]overnment funding for an Advanced Propulsion Centre.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]This will 
[normal]support
[normal] 
[normal]improvements
[normal] in air quality 
[normal]as well as
[normal] 
[normal]reductions in
[normal] carbon 
[normal]and greenhouse gas emissions
[normal].
[normal]1.7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We also want to ensure that improvements to 
[normal]the 
[normal]SRN
[normal] 
[normal]take account of the needs of non-motorised users, such as cyclists and walkers. This includes addressing key areas where major
[normal] roads create a barrier to cyclists and walkers, improving safe access for cyclists, especially around junctions, and taking account of their needs in the design of road improvements. 
[normal]The Highways Agency has 
[normal]already 
[normal]been working with Sustrans to 
[normal]identify s
[normal]pecific
[normal] improvements 
[normal]across the
[normal] network. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Reform[bold]1.8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our strategic road network needs to be well-funded, with the right investment in the right places. However, it also needs to be well run in order to ensure that investment delivers value for money for
[normal] 
[normal]road users and taxpayers. 
[normal]1.9.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Action for Roads
[normal] set out a range of significant reforms, building on the recommendations of Alan Cook’s 2011 
[normal]independent report ‘
[normal]A Fresh Start for the Strategic Road Network
[normal],
[normal]to improve performance and efficiency. These included:
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.10.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We expect these reforms to generate major efficiency savings across the roads programme. We will be launching a consultation on our more detailed proposals for reforming the Highways Agency in the near future.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is important that transport planning is integrated with land use planning so that transport facilities can be developed to meet future needs at the outset. 
[normal]In May 2012 we set out 
[normal]plans for 
[normal]route based strategies (RBS
[normal]s
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]to 
[normal]identify 
[normal]the management and enhancement 
[normal]needs 
[normal]of our road network
[normal],
[normal] tak
[normal]ing
[normal] account of local needs and interests
[normal], including
[normal] local authorities, Local Enterprise Partnerships, motorists’ organis
[normal]ations, environmental groups and others
[normal].
[normal]2.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Recent H
[normal]A schemes already include successful links with local transport –
[normal]for example 
[normal]new improvements to the A453 will connect directly to park and ride facilities on the Nottingham Express Transit extension. 
[normal]Over t
[normal]he next two years RBS
[normal]s
[normal] will cover all of the network and 
[normal]help identify where these synergies exist
[normal], and will form a key part of the evidence that will inform the first Roads Investment Strategy
[normal]. 
[normal]This may include identifying
[normal] cases where the best way to addr
[normal]ess capacity issues on the 
[normal]SRN
[normal] will be to do something
[normal] on other networks.
[normal] 
[normal]More broadly, w
[normal]e will also seek to 
[normal]align road 
[normal]and
[normal] 
[normal]rail investment strategies 
[normal]from 2017. 
[normal]2.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We should not be looking to choose between investing in roads and investing in rail if we want to remain internationally competitive. 
[normal]That is why they Government has committed to significant, complementary investments in both our road and rail networks.
[normal] T
[normal]r
[normal]ansformative projects such as HS2 and Crossrail are investments in our national economic success. It is important that these networks serve to complement one another to enhance the 
[normal]UK
[normal]’s connectivity. Subject to consultation, the proposed HS2 stations at Bi
[normal]rmingham International, 
[normal]Manchester
[normal] 
[normal]Airport
[normal], East Midlands and
[normal] 
[normal]Sheffield
[normal] will all be located close to existing motorways.
[normal]2.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]D
[normal]epartment 
[normal]has committed
[normal] to publish
[normal]ing
[normal] a 
[normal]National Networks 
[normal]National Policy Statement (NN NPS) by the end of the year which will set
[normal] out the policy and planning framework within which applications for planning consent for nationally significant road, rail and rail freight interchange developments are considered. 
[normal]The 
[normal]NN 
[normal]NPS
[normal] will make an important contribution to removing planning barrie
[normal]rs to growth by providing clarity and certainty to scheme promoters and decision-makers on the government’s priorities for development.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The N
[normal]ational 
[normal]T
[normal]ransport 
[normal]M
[normal]odel (NTM)
[normal] is designed to forecast long-term trends (currently 2010 to 2040 in five year intervals) based on:
[normal]3.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The three key drivers for road traffic are population, income and the costs
[normal] of road transport
[normal]. Between 2010-2040 the population in 
[normal]England
[normal] is expected to rise by 20%, GDP 
[normal]per capita is projected to 
[normal]rise by 57% and the fuel cost of driving is projected to fall by 28%. By 2040 
[normal]SRN
[normal] traffic is forecast 
[normal](in the central case) 
[normal]to be 46% higher than in 2010, implying an increase in congestion (measured
[normal] 
[normal]as lost time) of about 114%.
[normal]3.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]B
[normal]ackcasting exercise
[normal]s, which 
[normal]input past economic and demographic drivers into the NTM accurately 
[normal]support projections of
[normal] actual traffic growth on all roads in 
[normal]England
[normal], 
[normal]and 
[normal]give us confidence in our forecast
[normal]s
[normal], 
[normal]though we acknowledge that our model tends to 
[normal]ov
[normal]erestimate traffic in urban areas (e.g. 
[normal]London
[normal]) and underestimate traffic in rural areas
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]We continually work to update and improve our modelling and understanding on what and why something is happening and the impact on the future.
[normal]3.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, u
[normal]ncertainty is inherently part of forecasting and predicting future behaviour and trends. 
[normal]T
[normal]raffic trends and outcomes depend on a large number of variables, economic (
[normal]GDP
[normal], oil prices) and behavioural (people preferences, trends and social habits). 
[normal]Forecasts
[normal] must be interpreted as best estimates given 
[normal]the 
[normal]current state of
[normal] 
[normal]information and assumptions. We seek
[normal] to 
[normal]reflect
[normal] this uncertainty by using 
[normal]scenario analysis and 
[normal]sensitivity analysis to understand 
[normal]the 
[normal]impact
[normal] of different assumptions
[normal] and 
[normal]a range of potentia
[normal]l alternative outcome
[normal]s
[normal]. 
[normal]3.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We are exploring any changing patterns in the demand to travel, 
[normal]using the latest National Travel Survey (NTS) data
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]through the re-estimation of the 
[normal]‘
[normal]trip rates
[normal]’
[normal], and the resultant number of trips to and from an area
[normal]. These are
[normal] us
[normal]ed in 
[normal]our
[normal] National Transport Model (NTM) and 
[normal]also
[normal] feed into local roads schemes modelling and appraisal. 
[normal]The first stage of 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]project
[normal] 
[normal]is 
[normal]addressing three key topics:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The second stage of the trip rates project will further investigate the drivers behind any travel demand changes in trip rates observed from the first stage.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Government has committed 
[normal]a substantial increase in investment 
[normal]on the 
[normal]SRN
[normal], which 
[normal]will 
[normal]help address long-term issues of capacity.
[normal]4.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Much of the additional capacity 
[normal]on the motorway network 
[normal]will be provided through application of 
[normal]smart
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]motorways
[normal] (also known as ‘managed motorways’)
[normal]. This is to help get the best out of some of the most con
[normal]&#xad;
[normal]gested sec
[normal]&#xad;
[normal]tions of our motor
[normal]&#xad;
[normal]way net
[normal]&#xad;
[normal]work. 
[normal]4.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Government will also 
[normal]include
[normal] upgrade
[normal]s to
[normal] the national non
[normal]-motorway network managed by the H
[normal]ighways 
[normal]A
[normal]gency
[normal], with a 
[normal]significant 
[normal]proportion moved to dual-lane and grade-separated road ‘expressway’ standard to ensure free-flowing traffic nationwide. As part of this, the Government will tackle some of the most notori
[normal]ous and long-standing road hot spots in the country. Roads which are widely recognised as being in need of a solution to alleviate congestion and tackle enduring problems.
[normal]4.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Government will identify and fund solutions, initially through feasibility studi
[normal]es, to look at problems and identify potential schemes on the A303 to the south west, the A27 on the south coast, the A1 north of 
[normal]Newcastle
[normal], A1 Newcastle-Gateshead Western by-pass, 
[normal]the A47 
[normal]and trans-Pennine routes between Sheffield and 
[normal]Manchester
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Innovat[bold]ive technology[bold]4.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]Govern
[normal]ment recognises the important role of technology 
[normal]and information 
[normal]in improving how people travel. Academia and industry are typically at the forefront of identifying the opportunities and challenges presented by new technologies, an
[normal]d in pushing the boundaries of what is possible. The role for Government is to provide the right environment and support to allow new technologies to flourish
[normal], including, for example,
[normal] 
[normal]through sett
[normal]ing 
[normal]a clear
[normal] strategic vision and policy framework
[normal], 
[normal]removing 
[normal]barriers to commercialisation
[normal], developing standards and bringing stakeholders together to address common issues
[normal].
[normal]4.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Department for Transport and the Highways Agency are already making effective use of innovative technologies to improve reliability, effici
[normal]ency and safety
[normal] on the strategic roads for which they are responsible.
[normal]4.7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Following the success of the M42
[normal] 
[normal]smart motorway pilot scheme
[normal] -
[normal] 
[normal]which 
[normal]dramatically improved safety
[normal] and
[normal] 
[normal]reliability of 
[normal]journeys, as well as reduced emissions and
[normal] noise -
[normal] the 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment is
[normal] 
[normal]making a large scale commitment
[normal] to this technology. Of the 26 new Highways Agency national roads schemes due to start work by 2015, 13 are 
[normal]smart 
[normal]motorway schemes (see fig 2.4 in 
[normal]Action for Roads
[normal]). 
[normal]4.8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We have also provided funding to police forces in England
[normal] for 3D laser scanners to enable faster evidence capture by the police 
[normal]following incidents, ensuring that lanes can be re-opened as soon as possible, minimising
[normal] disruption to 
[normal]road users
[normal] and surrounding areas
[normal].
[normal]4.9.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Department for Transport and the Highways A
[normal]gency are also exploring the potential benefits and implications of
[normal] 
[normal]emerging technologies that will influence our roads in the future
[normal], as well as being closely involved in discussions at European level.
[normal] A particular area of interest is ‘cooperative systems
[normal]’ where 
[normal]vehicles cooperate with one another
[normal] and/or the road infrastructure. 
[normal]4.10.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]DfT has been working with researchers at 
[normal]Oxford
[normal] 
[normal]University
[normal] and Nissan to develop a ground-breaking trial for semi-autonomous cars, ensuring that government legislation does
[normal] no
[normal]t bl
[normal]ock innovation. 
[normal]DfT is 
[normal]also 
[normal]currently in the process of commissioning a feasibility study
[normal] 
[normal]to examine
[normal] the 
[normal]potential benefits and impacts of 
[normal]‘platooning’ for heavy vehicles on strategic roads,
[normal] and the possibility of UK trials
[normal].
[normal]4.11.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Government’s plans for 
[normal]reforming the 
[normal]Highways 
[normal]A
[normal]gency will 
[normal]also 
[normal]provide 
[normal]greater freedom, flexibility and in
[normal]centives
[normal] for the SRN road operator 
[normal]to develop innovative techniques to improve network management
[normal] and deliver more efficiently
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment is committed to investing in our national road infrastructure to improve capacity, reduce conges
[normal]tion and enhance connectivity across the country. 
[normal]In 
[normal]Investing in Britain’s Future
[normal], the Government outlined a dramatic increase in the level of public investment in infrastructure of all kinds, including roads. 
[normal]This will fund the biggest-ever upgrade of our existing network. 
[normal]5.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In delivering this investment, we will consider the ways in which the private sector can best help speed delivery and drive efficiency.
[normal]  
[normal]5.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We continue to rule out tolls as a mechanism to fund
[normal] existing roads. However
[normal],
[normal] t
[normal]here will be cases where the combination of the significant expense of the scheme and the distribution of the benefits means that it is fair that users meet some of the costs of the scheme, rather than general taxpayers. This wou
[normal]ld be in very limited circumstances where schemes deliver new roads or transform an existing road into an entirely new route beyond all recognition and there is a strong economic and commercial case for a contribution from tolling.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]5.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]‘
[normal]Action for Roads
[normal]’
[normal] has
[normal] set out the Government’s plans for reforming the Highways Agency, making it more efficient, more secure, and giving it the freedoms needed to match the best performance in the private sector. 
[normal] 
[normal]5.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]International experience, as well as lessons from the way oth
[normal]er types of infrastructure are run in the 
[normal]UK
[normal], suggests that this could lead to more efficiency, quicker delivery and better forward planning.
[normal] [bold]As discussed in ‘
[normal]Action for Roads
[normal]’ 
[normal]most European countries, such as 
[normal]France
[normal], 
[normal]Austria
[normal] and 
[normal]Sweden
[normal], run their 
[normal]strategic roads at much greater distance from central government.
[normal]5.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We are confident that our programme of reforms will allow 
[normal]England
[normal]’s roads to catch up wit
[normal]h its international competitors
[normal]. We will continue to keep 
[normal]the potential contribution of private finan
[normal]ce
[normal] under review, but further institution
[normal]al change would only come after full 
[normal]discussion 
[normal]with the public and stakeholder groups. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The management of the 
[normal]SRN
[normal] will always be a partnership between the network operator on the one hand and a range of private sector contractors on the other. Successful cooperation is vital to a well-run and cost-effective road network.
[normal]6.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The
[normal] transformation
[normal] to set up the Highways Agen
[normal]cy as a
[normal] 
[normal]publicly-owned company
[normal], as laid out in 
[normal]‘
[normal]Action for Roads
[normal]’
[normal] is aligned with the recommendations made in 
[normal]Alan Cook
[normal]’s independent 
[normal]2011 
[normal]report 
[normal]and 
[normal]will
[normal] 
[normal]substantially improve the network operator’s performance
[normal]. 
[normal]We will provide more details of the Governm
[normal]ent’s proposals for reform of the Agency in our forthcoming consultation.
[normal]6.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]These changes
[normal] 
[normal]represent
[normal] a clear break from 
[normal]the 
[normal]short-term thinking and stop-start culture
[normal] that has affected the management of the network to date
[normal]. It will put in place the structures
[normal], commitments and relationships to support a more ambitious infrastructure programme, and allow the 
[normal]SRN
[normal] to operate more like the best-performing infrastructure providers in other sectors. 
[normal]6.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It will mean a clearer, more strategic role for government – provid
[normal]ing a strong, certain framework against which the managers of the 
[normal]SRN
[normal] could be held to account, and a network operator who can prioritise network management over government processes. 
[normal]6.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This will have knock on benefits for suppliers. Credible independence 
[normal]will allow confidence in road investment plans, enabling suppliers to procure materials at lower costs through longer contracts and invest more in recruitment and staff training.
[normal]6.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It will also challenge the supply sector. T
[normal]he 
[normal]new body 
[normal]will be seeking an exp
[normal]ansion in supply, cost savings and doing things faster
[normal], which will bring new challenges to m
[normal]anufacturers and suppliers
[normal].
[normal] We will need industry to step up to help us deliver our objective to have a road network fit for the 21
[normal]st
[normal] century.
