[normal]Written evidence submitted by Walsall Housing Group[bold]1.0 [bold]Executive Summary[bold]This submission
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.0 [bold]About [bold]whg[bold]whg
[normal] is one of the largest social housing providers in the 
[normal]West Midlands
[normal]. It owns and manages around 19,000 properties in the Metropolitan Borough of Walsall, housing almost 40,000 people, around one fifth of the borough’s population. 
[normal]whg
[normal] was founded in 2003 with the transfer of Walsall Council’s housing stock and has since in
[normal]vested over £350 million in 
[normal]that stock.  It 
[normal]has developed a range of services that go beyond the landlord’s traditional contractual role and support customers to sustain their tenancies.
[normal]3.0 [bold]Reason for submission[bold]Whg
[normal] is 
[normal]a large landlord
[normal] 
[normal]and has 
[normal]conducted r
[normal]esearch into the impact of the reforms and expects 
[normal]some challen
[normal]ges for
[normal] 
[normal]itself and its customers
[normal]. It
[normal] believes that its 
[normal]findings, 
[normal]experience
[normal] and 
[normal]development of 
[normal]best practice 
[normal]will help to
[normal] 
[normal]inform 
[normal]the 
[normal]inquiry
[normal] into
[normal] the effects of welfare reform and how housing providers
[normal] can mitigate them.

[normal]4.0 [bold]Implications of the [bold]welfare reforms [bold]on [bold]whg[bold] [bold]and [bold]its customers[bold]w
[normal]hg
[normal] 
[normal]has assessed 
[normal]the potential impacts of 
[normal]the social sector size criteria, the overall benefit cap and the 
[normal]direct payment of Universal Credit
[normal]. These 
[normal]reform 
[normal]measures were chosen because of the direct nature of their impact on housing providers
[normal] and customers
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1 
[normal]Size Criteria 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]w
[normal]hg
[normal] predicted that the social sector size criteria would affect 2,800 customers under-occupying according to the Department for Work and Pensions 
[normal]occupancy 
[normal]rules. This would create a shortfall between rent due and benefit paid of some £1.9 million pounds
[normal] pe
[normal]r annum
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]It is still relatively early in the process of assessing the 
[normal]actual 
[normal]impact, but 
[normal]whg’s
[normal] 
[normal]records 
[normal]at the end of August suggest an increase in rent arrears 
[normal]in excess of £750,000 in this financial year
[normal],
[normal] of which 
[normal]just under £400,000 can be directly attri
[normal]buted to the size criteria
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]The
[normal] shortfall of 
[normal]Housing Benefit represents the amount of total rent
[normal]not be
[normal]ing
[normal] eligible for payment of Housing Benefit and which must be
[normal]paid by 
[normal]whg
[normal] customers from elsewhere within their benefit income or other
[normal]means.
[normal] Initial research showed that 
[normal]1 bedroom under
[normal]-
[normal]occupiers
[normal] had average rents of 
[normal]£86.30
[normal] per week and when a 
[normal]14% 
[normal]deduction was applied, there w
[normal]as 
[normal]a 
[normal]£12.05
[normal] shortfall
[normal]. Where 
[normal]2 or more bedroom
[normal]s were under-occupied incurring a 25% deduction, the average weekly rent
[normal] was 
[normal]£84.82
[normal] with a 
[normal]£21.21
[normal] shortfall
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2 
[normal]Direct payments to Universal Credit claimants
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]H
[normal]ousing 
[normal]Benefit has not 
[normal]been 
[normal]paid 
[normal]directly to 
[normal]the vast majority of 
[normal]benefit claimants in recent years, 
[normal]so 
[normal]it has been difficult to obtain consistent and reliable evidence on the likely magnitude of 
[normal]potential 
[normal]loss of rent
[normal] revenue from switching to payment to claimants 
[normal]when Universal Credit is rolled out. 
[normal]While 
[normal]the direct payment demonstration projects were set 
[normal]up
[normal] to provide such guidance
[normal], it has become apparent that there are many variations by location
[normal], the nature of the stock
[normal] and 
[normal]demographics
[normal]. 
[normal]T
[normal]he guarded 
[normal]culture around the projects 
[normal]has not 
[normal]assisted 
[normal]landlords to 
[normal]obtain 
[normal]a feel for 
[normal]the magnitude of
[normal] 
[normal]direct payments’ likely 
[normal]impact
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Gathering meaningful information has been 
[normal]further complicated by changes to the 
[normal]Universal Credit 
[normal]roll out programme
[normal]. If the roll
[normal] 
[normal]out timescale, geographical spread and complexity of the claims allowed
[normal] 
[normal]is not known, provide
[normal]rs cannot model the rate at which the effects of direct payment will be felt
[normal] without a large margin of error
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Whg
[normal] has therefore erred on the side of prudence by 
[normal]substantially increasing 
[normal]its bad debt provision.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3 
[normal]Overall Benefit Cap
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The benefit cap may
[normal] lead to a loss of rent income
[normal] where 
[normal]families 
[normal]have to adjust to 
[normal]reduced budgets
[normal]. 
[normal]C
[normal]apped households are being asked to prioritise their 
[normal]spending 
[normal]from a shrinking budget and th
[normal]erefore
[normal] housing providers are in competit
[normal]i
[normal]on with other
[normal] demands on the household p
[normal]urse
[normal]. 
[normal]Advice agencies 
[normal]often 
[normal]express the idea t
[normal]hat 
[normal]customers 
[normal]should prioritise the roof over 
[normal]their heads, 
[normal]but the fact that excess
[normal] awards are 
[normal]sliced off 
[normal]benefit to pay for housing 
[normal]sends a subliminal message to tenants that housing 
[normal]is their 
[normal]least priority
[normal]. 
[normal]This w
[normal]ill 
[normal]inevitably lead to rent payments being missed, arrears being built up and tenancies at risk of not being sustained.     
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.0 [bold]whg[bold] Mitigation against the impacts of reform[bold]As a result of the impacts to the organisation and its customers, 
[normal]whg
[normal] 
[normal]developed a
[normal] comprehensive 
[normal]action plan to mitigate the 
[normal]major 
[normal]effects of the reform measures with the aim
[normal]s
[normal] of 
[normal]mitigating the impacts on its customers 
[normal]and 
[normal]maximising 
[normal]its ability to 
[normal]continue to 
[normal]provide 
[normal]excellent 
[normal]housing and related 
[normal]service
[normal]s. 
[normal]Some 
[normal]initiatives from 
[normal]the plan are set out 
[normal]below
[normal].
[normal]5.1 Customer Services Training and Scripting
[normal]The impact of the reforms across 
[normal]whg’s
[normal] customer base meant that as many colleagues as possible needed to be given relevant 
[normal]training 
[normal]about the reforms so that a triage
[normal] service was viable
[normal]. Training enabled 
[normal]whg
[normal] colleagues to help as many customers as possible with queries at the first point of contact, whilst more complex issues were referred to specialist
[normal] colleagues
[normal]. In addition, scripts were developed and available for 
[normal]anyone in the business to access via the internal computer network to use to guide responses to incoming queries. 
[normal]5.2 Communications Strategy
[normal]The broad impact also governed 
[normal]whg’s
[normal] communications strategy. With a large number of affected customers, a variet
[normal]y of
[normal] methods of contact was adopted
[normal] for 
[normal]our diverse customer base. Methods adopted included personal contact, 
[normal]mail shot
[normal], customer leaflets, website information, social media such as Twitter and 
[normal]Facebook
[normal] as well as engaging customers to talk about welfare r
[normal]eform issues in the course of everyday business.
[normal]5.3 Financial Inclusion Review
[normal]F
[normal]inancial inclusion provision was reviewed
[normal] and the 
[normal]decision was taken to recruit three money mentors to supplement the Welfare Benefit and Debt Advice function and provide a tr
[normal]iage service to customers 
[normal]likely to be af
[normal]fected by under-occup
[normal]ation deductions and 
[normal]the benefit cap. It is expected that this work will continue for Universal Credit
[normal] claimants who may be vulnerable and need help to cope with direct benefit payment to them.
[normal]5.4 Direct Debit as Preferred method of Payment
[normal]The replacement of 
[normal]landlord direct 
[normal]payment with 
[normal]direct 
[normal]payment 
[normal]to claimants of 
[normal]Universal Credit 
[normal]will 
[normal]mean that customers 
[normal]will 
[normal]have 
[normal]a responsibility to pay rent where th
[normal]e fact that they pay rent 
[normal]may not necess
[normal]arily be apparent to them under the current Housing Benefit system. The consequence will be that at least some proportion of rent payments will not be made because of the switch.
[normal] 
[normal]To minimise loss
[normal] of rent income from direct payment
[normal], 
[normal]whg
[normal] adopted direct debi
[normal]t as its preferred method of 
[normal]pa
[normal]yment. All new tenants since September 2012 have been required to set up direct debits or find a suitable 
[normal]proxy 
[normal]method
[normal] such as via a budgeting or jam jar account. Extensive work has been done to incorporate affordability and 
[normal]money management training into the pre-tenancy customer experience.
[normal] This training is also available to those 
[normal]customers who approach 
[normal]whg
[normal] to give notice on their tenancy because they are experiencing affordability issues.
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]additional 
[normal]goal was set to get a
[normal]ll existing customers 
[normal]to go on 
[normal]to direct debit. To support this
[normal], 
[normal]a choice of only two direct debit payment days per month has been replaced with ‘any day’ direct debit so that customers can synchronise their rent payment with the date that they receive ben
[normal]efit payments.
[normal] Our latest figures from August 2013 show that direct debit take up is increasing at roughly 400 customers on average each month.
[normal]5.5 
[normal]Budgeting or Jam Jar Accounts
[normal]If a customer does not have a
[normal] bank account or is unsuitably banked, 
[normal]whg
[normal] signpo
[normal]sts its customers to the local 
[normal]Walsave
[normal] credit union
[normal]. 
[normal]Walsave
[normal] 
[normal]offers a budgeting account w
[normal]hich has the 
[normal]facility to mimic a direct debit payment
[normal]. To encourage take up, 
[normal]whg
[normal] pays the first year’s set up and administration costs of £23, which means that 
[normal]customers do not have to pay transaction charges in the first year.
[normal] A personal spending pot is set up and 
[normal]whg
[normal] adds ten pounds to it on setting up the account with the ability to add another five pounds if the customer maintains a clear rent account for six
[normal] months.
[normal] 
[normal]To make it as easy as possible for customers to sign up for a budgeting account, 
[normal]a
[normal] 
[normal]whg
[normal] colleague has been seconded to 
[normal]Walsave
[normal] to be available in the main 
[normal]whg
[normal] reception area 
[normal]so that 
[normal]immediate help
[normal] is available if customers decide that a jam jar acc
[normal]ount is beneficial to them
[normal]. 
[normal]The requirement for customers to pay by direct debit or ‘jam jar’ account attempts to mitigate the 
[normal]effects 
[normal]of customers no longer pa
[normal]y
[normal]ing by benefit direct. 
[normal]whg
[normal] believes that 
[normal]housing should be considered as a
[normal]n essential househol
[normal]d expenditure
[normal] along with council tax
[normal], utilities
[normal] and food
[normal]. In an ideal world, it would 
[normal]prefer
[normal] 
[normal]payment 
[normal]under Universal Credit to be made direct from benefit
[normal]. 
[normal] I
[normal]n the medium to long term
[normal], this 
[normal]would result in lower 
[normal]public sector 
[normal]costs as there would be less h
[normal]omelessness and finance
[normal]-
[normal]related household stre
[normal]ss
[normal].)
[normal]5.6 
[normal]Wincred
[normal] (
[normal]Walsall
[normal] in Credit)
[normal]As planning for reform proceeded, 
[normal]whg
[normal] was 
[normal]wholly 
[normal]aware that it could not do all of the work necessary to mitigate reform on its own. Partnership working was therefore of 
[normal]vital importance
[normal]. 
[normal]In Walsall, financial inclusion work is co-ordinated through the 
[normal]Wincred
[normal] partnership, an umbrella organisation for all partners with an interest in the financial wellbeing of Walsall residents. Members include various department of the lo
[normal]cal authority, 
[normal]Walsave
[normal], Citizens Advice Bureau and various advice and third sector bodies. 
[normal]The partners
[normal] have undertaken campaigns such as one warning vulnerable tenants against the threat of loan sharks and doorstep lenders.  
[normal]5.7 I.T.’s Your Life
[normal]Partners
[normal]hip between 
[normal]whg
[normal] and Walsall Adult and Community College (WACC) brought a 
[normal]new 
[normal]digital inclusion 
[normal]initiative 
[normal]into being
[normal]. A small sample survey early in the process of welfare reform planning showed that only 58% or residents had suitable home-based internet a
[normal]ccess for the purpose of claiming Universal Credit in line with the government’s stated wish for people to claim online.
[normal] The “I.T.’s Your Life” programme was born from th
[normal]e partnership
[normal] with WACC
[normal]. The programme uses public facilities 
[normal]such as public libraries
[normal] 
[normal]to run short courses which enable 
[normal]people to get access to computers, develop skills to use online services and to set up an email address. 
[normal]Crucially, 
[normal]those finishing the course are enabled to 
[normal]m
[normal]ake and manage benefit claims digitally.
[normal]5.8
[normal] Independent Livin
[normal]g Team workshops for external organisations
[normal]Aside from formal partnerships, 
[normal]whg’s
[normal] Independent Living Team organised a series of free workshops 
[normal]at which 
[normal]partner organisations, stakeholders
[normal], 
[normal]NHS and other health and social services
[normal] were 
[normal]given a 
[normal]present
[normal]ation 
[normal]to engage them and make them more aware of welfare reform issues
[normal]. This
[normal] knowledge inform
[normal]ed
[normal] their
[normal] subsequent 
[normal]interactions with 
[normal]the 
[normal]more vulnerable
[normal] customers
[normal] affected by the changes
[normal]. The
[normal] series of eight
[normal] workshops w
[normal]as
[normal] 
[normal]over-subscribed and feedback rated the 
[normal]sessions as excellent
[normal]. The sessions were
[normal] replicated regionally a
[normal]t the request of the 
[normal]West Midlands Best Use of Stock partnership
[normal].
[normal]6.0 [bold]Conclusion[bold]whg’s
[normal] approach to welfare reform recognises that the organisation and our customers will face difficult times a
[normal]s the welfare reforms come into effect and beyond. Plans were developed to include as many mitigating interventions as possible to help sustain tenancies and to maintain services. 
[normal]The mitigations have been positively received in Walsall and it is hoped tha
[normal]t they will help to inform the debate on how tenants, especially vulnerable ones, can be helped
[normal] nationally
[normal]Whilst we cautiously look forward to the introduction of Universal Credit the issue of 
[normal]direct payment of the housing element of Universal credit is o
[normal]ne that should be reviewed. The greater benefit of household stability far outweighs the desire to replicate the household budget of working households.
