[normal]Written evidence from Academy of Medical Sciences (PHE001[bold]7[bold])[bold]&#xa0;[bold] The Academy of Medical Sciences is the independent body in the UK that represents the diverse spectrum of medical science – from basic research through clinical application to healthcare delivery. Our mission is to promote medical science and its translation into benefits for society. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Academy considers that any public health system should have research as a central part of its activity, ensure close integration of public health researchers and practitioners and deliver independent evidence-based advice (for further detail, please see the Academy’s consultation response to the Government’s November 2010 white paper 
[normal]'Healthy lives, healthy people: Our strategy for public health in England
[normal]' and my predecessor’s letter to the Secretary of State regarding the public health strategy, both available at

[normal]).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Consequently, the Academy was pleased to be approached by Public Health England (PHE) at the time of their formation to provide expert input into the development of its research strategy. The Academy convened a high-level meeting in June 2013 between research leaders and representatives from PHE to examine the interface between research and practice in public health. The key issues that were highlighted as critical for PHE to consider in their research strategy are outlined in a three-page meeting note that is now available online (

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We welcome PHE’s continued engagement with the Academy to obtain expert feedback and input from leading researchers and other stakeholders on its emerging research strategy, including the identification of appropriate outcome measures and highlighting any gaps. The Academy and PHE will be jointly hosting a follow-up meeting at the end of November that will bring together public health researchers with representatives from the Department of Health, research funders and public health practice.
