default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default1.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBefore responding to the questions posed by the Committ
defaultee we would make two points.
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultL
defaultocal amenities have been replaced by more centralised units or by more remote
default development, meaning people are having to travel further.
default This is obviously lin
defaultked to a rise in car ownership, b
defaultut a quarter of households in Great
default Britain, for a variet
defaulty of reasons, do not have a car. 
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIsolation is important to define as it is not just people in sparsely populated and rural areas that experience isolation. 
defaultEven
default in urban and suburban areas 
defaultpeople may be isolated due to 
defaultpoor public t
defaultransport and lack of many public amenities.
default&#xa0;
default1.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe strongly welcome this inquiry. 
defaultIt is evident that Government spending cuts are making the issue of isolation worse as passenger transport has been significantly cut over the last three years. 
defaultThe Campaign for
default Better Transport has
default recently
default been working 
defaultto highlight the issues passengers face in isolated communities
default,
default and rural communities in particular
default. O
defaultver the last few months
default we have campaigned
default for sustained
default support of 
defaultrural transport up to an
defaultd beyond the Spen
defaultding Round
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default1.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe have recently published 
defaultfour
default pieces of research of relevance to the Inquiry
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default1.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAll of these studies point towards how important getting public transport right is for low income groups
default&#xa0;
default1.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAll modes of passenger transport are important but it is fair to say the most important
default and most frequently used
default mode of passenger transport in rural areas is the 
defaultbus;
default therefore we shall be focusing strongly on buses and their importance throughout this submission of written evidence. 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default2.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe needs of different groups of passengers are only occasionally taken into account when determining the provision of 
defaultpublic transport to isolated communities. 
defaultThese groups include: 
default&#xa0;default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultElderly defaultPassengersdefault-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultYounger Passengersdefault-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUnemployed Passengersdefault-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLow Income Passengersdefault-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDisabled Passengersdefault&#xa0;default2.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBefore briefly highlighting the needs of 
defaultthese 
defaultdifferent groups of passengers we would 
defaultlike to highlight t
defaulthree points 
defaultwhich 
defaultshould be taken into account when determining provision of public transport to isolated communities.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default2.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe following 
defaultbriefly identifies the needs of user groups that heavily rely on public transport.
default&#xa0;default2.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPassenger Transport and Isolation for the Elderlydefault - 
defaultPublic t
defaultransport isolation for the elderly is a very serious issue. 
defaultPublic t
defaultransport is a lifeline for many
default 
defaultolder people, w
defaultith many 
defaultelderly people unable to drive public transport is the only option and for many people over the age of 65 this option is 
defaultnot available. Public 
defaultt
defaultransport for the elderly enables them to connect with them with friends, family and their community whilst allowing them access to health and social care and other key services. 
default&#xa0;
default2.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOlder people and younger people make more trips by 
defaultpassenger
default transport (bus, coach and rail) than 
defaultany other age group
default. 
defaultT
defaulthis coincides with a decline in the number of people holding
default a car driving licence with 
defaultage;
default only 35 per cent of pensioner households in rural areas have no access to a car.
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthe 
defaultaccessi
defaultbility
default of public transport differs significantly between 
defaulturban and rural 
defaultcommunities. In urban areas the percentage of people who live within 13 minutes of a regular (hourly) bus is around 95%, in rural areas it
default falls to 
default50%
default.
default&#xa0;default2.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPassenger defaultTransport defaultIsolatiodefaultn for the Youngdefault - defaultYoung people travel
default a shorter total distance and make fewer journeys than they used to but must now make longer journeys to reach their most frequent destinations. They make most of their journeys by car but, in common with older people, they use cars less and travel by bus 
defaultmore than people in the middle age groups
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultYoung people make significantly fewer car journeys than they did – down from almost 600 trips per person each year in the mid-1990s to 377 trips in 2011 – and fewer young people now own cars or have driving 
defaultlicences (only 38% of 17-20 year olds now have a driving license compared to 48% in the early 1990s)
default.
default The provision of public transport to compensate for this trend has however not been taken into account by local or central governments. 
default&#xa0;default2.9
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTransport defaultIsoladefaulttion for defaultpeople who are unemployeddefault - defaultThe location of job centres causes difficulties for those in rural areas, particularly when Jobcentre Plus offices insist on weekly or daily signing-on and when offices have closed permanently.
default&#xa0;
default2.10
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThose living in rural ar
defaulteas without access to a car face particular difficulties in finding work due to poor transport provision and a lack of affordable social housing located nearer to employment opportunities. Those on low incomes may also be reluctant to move nearer to jobs d
defaultue to their informal networks of support or family commitments in the area where they currently live
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.11
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTwo out of five jobseekers say lack of transport is a barrier to getting a job. The cost of transport can be a problem getting to interviews and transpo
defaultrt problems can be a deterrent to making job applications
default&#xa0;default2.12
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTransport defaultIsodefaultlation for people on low incomedefaults – defaultPeople on low incomes face similar issues and obstacles to those who 
defaultare out of work.
default&#xa0;
default2.13
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLow income families are more dependent than others on bus 
defaulttravel; buses account for a larger proportion of their income and the cheaper fare deals which involve paying larger lump sums are often unavailable to them. Bus fare increases restrict the ability of households to meet the transport costs of their childre
defaultn for important out of school activities and transport costs can be a barrier to employment for low income families
default&#xa0;
default2.14
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPeople in the lowest income quintile make three times more journeys by bus than people in the highest income quintile
default&#xa0;default2.15
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTransport Isolationdefault for people with disabilitiesdefault - defaultDisabled people are more likely to mention transport as a local concern than non-disabled people, 60 per cent of disabled people have no car in the household and hey use buses around 20 per cent more frequently than non-disa
defaultbled people.
default&#xa0;
default2.16
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultInaccessible transport cuts disabled people off from community and family life.
default defaultFifty per cent say they did not see friends and family
default defaultas often as they’d like because of inaccessible transport and 20% find it difficult or impossible to get 
defaultthe healthcare they need because of inaccessible transport.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default3.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe main challenge to prov
defaultiding better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities is funding. Since 
default2010 central Government funding for buses has been cut by 20% and funding for supported bus services has been cut by 20%
default.
default&#xa0;default3.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSupply and demand is an issue in iso
defaultlated communitie
defaults with
default a higher cost per passenger journey for the operators. The wider benefits to local economies must be considered when making decisions on local transport.
default&#xa0;default3.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIntegrated Transport – defaultDue to the nature of a privatise
defaultd
default rail network and deregulated bus services a huge challenge is getting transport operators to work together to promote integrated transport, which in isolated communities can be vital. 
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNetwork St Albans
default 
defaultwas launched in 2009 to bring together all the orga
defaultnisations which have a role to play in providing/improving transport in the city of St Albans, with the aim to reduce traffic congestion. It was St Albans Local Strategic Partnership (LSP) that formed the basis for developing a public transport related par
defaulttnership to come up with alternatives to single occupancy car use in St Albans.
default 
default  
defaultThe negative impacts imposed on the city and wider area from local traffic congestion and pollution (specifically on Pea Hen Junction), needed a strategic approach, which in
defaultcludes improving public transport service provision and infrastructure.
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGreater integrated transport systems should also be strongly encouraged for isolated areas enabling bus and train operators to work with local authorities to promote cooperation and enabling a greater door to door journey experience from public transport. 
default&#xa0;default3.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA study by the Campaign for Better Transport on door to door journeys identified four key points needed for success
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default4.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCommunity transport 
defaultcan be 
defaulta lifeline in both rural and urban areas. It takes disabled people t
defaulto work, children to school, sick people to healthcare and older people to the shops. It runs local bus routes and provides transport for a wide range of clubs, voluntary bodies and care homes. People shape the services they want and comm
defaultunity transport mak
defaultes it happen.
default&#xa0;default4.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCommunity Transport schemes serving the most remote corners of the country, or schemes working in partnership with other local services like youth clubs or care homes, can really make a huge difference to people who use them. Community Transport is part of
default the Transport mix in isolated communities but not the sole 
defaultsolution to passenger transport
default.
default&#xa0;default4.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCentral Government and Local Authorities are unrealistic if they expect volunteer run community transport projects to fill gaps left by deep bus cuts. Research fr
defaultom the Community Transport Association has shown that community transport can only fill between 10 to 15 per cent
default of former supported transport provision
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe integration of services and pooling for budgets, at both local and national levels, can ensure t
defaulthat public money is made to work harder. Some local authorities have already made savings by integrating the way they contract public bus services, school buses and social services transport. Partnerships between councils, operators and big institutions li
defaultke hospitals and universities have had good results. Taxi buses, NHS transport, travel schemes for post 16 students and social enterprises all have a part to play. In some cases core routes linking towns are met by demand response village services at reque
defaultst stops. 
default&#xa0;
default4.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA ‘Total Transport’ solution for areas affected by cuts to services which would bring together all transport provision in an area
default such as private operators, council run services, 
defaulth
defaultospital 
defaultt
defaultransport
default and social services.
default&#xa0;
default4.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCommunity Rail Partnersh
defaultips play
default an important 
defaultrole in
default providing transport for isolated communities.
default 
defaultThe case for new or reopened connections is increasingly strong, with demand for rail now at its highest level since before the Second World War, despite the network being 
defaultconsiderably smaller than then. Despite the growing case for these connections, there is no clear process in the rail industry for this to happen and many local authorities lack the capacity or skills to progress schemes themselves. Some new lines and stat
defaultions have been built, however, and demand on these new lines and stations has usually been higher than forecast.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default5.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is 
defaultdifficult to say what extent passengers in isolated communities should rely upon taxis as previously described there are many different service users in these areas that all have di
defaultfferent needs and requirements.
default 
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIf taxis are used to replace public trans
defaultport then they should be demand responsive. Can a replacement taxi be adequately used for people in work or education at peak times. How far would this service also booked in advance.
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are various Taxi Voucher Schemes in place across a few 
defaultplaces
default in 
defaultEngland, most notably in London but also in Surrey, Cheshire, Brighton and Hove for example. Outside London these vouchers amount to around £70 per year on the basis that users give up their National Bus Pass in exchange.
default&#xa0;
default6.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA recent Case Study
default by Campaign for Better Transport
default of an area in the North East
default looked at an housing estate where bus cuts had taken place and where the local council had replaced the supported bus service with a r
defaultesidual 
defaultfree 
defaultbus 
defaultservice to the local supermarket. This st
defaultudy found that that some residents were forced into taking taxi’s but only those who could afford to. 
default&#xa0;
default6.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLocal residents were left isolated causing very serious impacts for many such as leaving the house much less to go shopping, visit friends and family. F
defaultinancial impacts due to having to travel by taxis, and most seriously, health and social impacts
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default6.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default“
defaultA lot of older people than me live around here and especially early morning I relied on this bus service. I can't walk very well, I have a stick so walking
default far is not an option unless the weather is dry.

default&#xa0;
default6.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDemand responsive transport can be important for residents in isolated communities
default.
default In Simo
defaultn Norton’s evidence to this committee he highlights the guidelines for good 
defaultdemand responsive service, which include:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default7.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFunding transport services in isolated communities is getting progressively harder and harder with spending cuts across the boar
defaultd since 2010. 
defaultThere must be a greater focus on transport integration and Local Authorities working together with all transport operators. 
default&#xa0;
default7.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDifferent modes of 
defaultt
defaultransport should be working together not against each other – it should not be a case of bus versus rail. 
default&#xa0;
default7.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhilst many argue for spending cuts to transport across the country
default,
default there must be a 
defaultgeneral
default recognition that investing in passenger transport is goo
defaultd for the country with wider benefits experienced economicall
defaulty, socially and environmentally to having a good transport system. People in isolated communities must not be left behind when budgets are cut and savings are made. 
default&#xa0;
default7.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA way forward would be to 
defaultcreate a ring fenced fund from Central Government for local buses which would p
defaultool investment in buses from the Government departments that most benefit 
defaultfrom them – DWP, DfE, DH. This would be d
defaultistributed as now through the Bus Service Operators Grant or t
defaulthrough a new approach that supports buses in rural as well as in urban areas based on accessibility.
