[[[(3) with the Aarhus Convention]]]&#xa0;PUBLIC PARTICIPATION DURING THE PREPARATION OF EXECUTIVE REGULATIONS AND/OR GENERALLY APPLICABLE LEGALLY BINDING NORMATIVE INSTRUMENTS&#xa0;that&#xa0;Each Party shall strive to promote effective public participation at an appropriate stage, and while options are still open, during the preparation by public authorities of executive regulations and other generally applicable legally binding rules that may have a significant effect on the environment.  …&#xa0;the repeal of this provision would seem to represent a threat to compliance with the UK’s obligations under Aarhus.  &#xa0;29th October 2013
