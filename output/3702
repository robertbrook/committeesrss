defaultThe BBC should be like the 
defaultMonarchy :
default it needs to be an excellent, non political ambassador that represents and serves the whole nation. It should also present unbiased, honest and serious information, educate, inspire, uplift, and entertain the nation. 
default2
default              
defaultThe BBC seems to be getting bigger, 'flabbier', less critical of itself, careless, arrogant
default,  and
default outrageously generous to itself with public money. The recent 
defaultSavil
default scandal suggests the BBC can be sloppy and very evasive.
defaultThere are more TV and Radio cha
defaultnnels. The more channels there are, the more diluted the quality of the 
defaultprogrammes
default becomes. But probably Radio and local radio are doing better than TV.  
defaultThere are excellent 
defaultprogrammes
default but fewer of them. Many believe the BBC has been 
defaultdumbing
default down. (We ha
defaultd a black and white TV with one channel - The BBC - I was allowed to stay up for 'The Cherry Orchard'. Now there are many channels with no 
defaultprogrammes
default like the Cherry Orchard.) It seems everything now has to be 'popular' on all channels.  BBC 4 was planned 
defaultas an 'Arts Channel'. But the 'arts' 
defaultprogrammes
default have been watered down.  What is BBC 3 for? Reduce the hours broadcast and 'distill' the 
defaultprogrammes
default into more powerful and potent offerings. 
defaultOriginally, 'heats' were broadcast weekly of 'Young musician of t
defaulthe year'.  Now with more BBC channels, the whole competition is condensed into a couple of 
defaultprogrammes
default (with much time given to what the competitors ate for 
defaultbreakfast,
default and the like than their performances). Why?
defaultThe BBC News channel seems to compare badly 
defaultwith Sky News, 
defaultAlgezeera
default, France 24, and even CNN. The BBC must have the most extensive news network of any? Building themselves (at public expense) the grandest News studio in the world seems to have resulted in a less concise and less interesting station
default.(
defaultAnd why waste so much air time every 1/4 hour with the same trailer?)
defaultRecently on BBC News International, for 12 hours, the main items of International news (every 15 
defaultmins
default) were the stock market floatation of 
default'Twitter' followed by the activities of the 
defaultMayor of Toronto.  
defaultRadio 4 still seems to be excellent but even this station shows clear signs of 
defaultdumbing
default down. One 
defaultprogramme
default in 
defaultparticular  -
default 'Dessert Island disks'. It was an interesting 
defaultprogramme
default with a variety of people. Now most cast-
defaultaways
default are 'cele
defaultbs', and the choice of discs has 
defaultdumbed
default down dramatically. What a pity! 
defaultThe changes at Radio 3 are a national, and even an international, calamity. This once great 
defaultprogramme
default was the envy of musicians throughout the world. It has suffered more fundamental
defaultly than other stations. The excuse given: it needs to appeal to a larger audience. Why? The BBC now offers listeners several more Radio stations. Does anyone worry that the BBC Asian service is only listened to by a small proportion of the nation?  It is i
defaultllogical to dumb down this quality station. Instead, why not nurture new listeners on other stations - Radio 2 and Radio 4 - (Recently, Radio 3 presented 3 weeks of film music, and yet one of the nation's finest composers, was allocated a week-end in this,
default his centenary year!) The strategy has failed: fewer people listen to Radio 3 than ever before. This can only show that more former supporters are leaving than new listeners are joining. Does a second rate station attracting fewer listeners make sense?
defaultTh
defaulte latest listening figures show that the most 
defaultdumbed
default down 
defaultprogramme
default of all - the breakfast show on Radio 3 - lost 100,000 listeners in the last three month 
defaultperiod :
default loosing 16% of its listeners in 3 months is a disaster. The experiment has failed. 
defaultThe BB
defaultC, and its excellent orchestras, 
defaultchampions
default modern music at the Proms as it should. It must be the most generous commissioner of new musical works in the world but does it use its financial clout wisely?  The vast majority of these performances are the prem
defaultiers and also the 
defaultderniers
default. Such a catalogue of total failures seems to be an extraordinary waste of public money.
defaultBBC Radio 3 is paranoid about the success of Classic FM. Why? Both 
defaultprogrammes
default can be different and serve different members of society. 
default(Woul
defaultd any one expect 'Simpson's-in-the-Strand' to add '
defaultbeefburgers
default and chips with mayo' to their menu to attract a larger number of clients?
default Or would anyone expect Oxford or Cambridge to offer 'Media studies' or the like, to attract more students? 
defaultOf course no
defaultt.)
default  And yet 
defaultalmost every change on Radio 3 is 'inspired' by Classic FM.
defaultIt seems that the BBC 
defaulthave
default been poor at appointing staff. Year after year, rather 
defaultcolourless
default executives seem to run the 
defaultorganisation
default. Appointees should have vision, personality, and 
defaultcharacter to lead the various divisions. Does anyone at the BBC now have the vision, enthusiasm and inspiration of an Attenborough, or a Drummond? 
defaultRecently, the new DG made a speech looking back at the quality of the BBC in the days of Lord Reith. Good n
defaultews! But then a couple of weeks later we heard the 'Reith lectures' - given by a transvestite dressed in a farcical dress with orange shoes, and absurdly overdone 'make-up', who sadly seemed to have nothing of consequence to say, broadcast at 9.00am! Who i
defaults the DG trying to kid?
default3
default              
default              
defaultYes. Surely far too many 
defaultprogrammes
default do not relate in 
defaultanyway
default to the high ideals of the Charter. 
defaultImpartiality.
default  Many claim the BBC is politically biased. Probably the balance is not quite right.
default4
default              
default              
defaultThe BBC should have unlimited
default scope, scale and remit within their financial constraints.
default5
default              
default              
defaultWith several channels and stations, 'particular audiences' should be catered for. In the early days of TV, one single national station was able to cater for diverse national interests: excelle
defaultnt international and national news coverage, serious discussions, political debate, 
defaultvisits
default to live theatre, opera, farce, satire, 
defaulthumour
default, light entertainment, and many major sporting events. 
default6
default              
default              
defaultWhat ever
default produces the best quality 
defaultprogrammes
default at the best v
defaultalue for 
defaultlicence
default fee 
defaultpayers.
default It is probably better to pay other (less profligate) 
defaultorganisations
default, to make as many 
defaultprogrammes
default as possible for us.
default7
default              
default              
defaultThe BBC must have the largest collection of radio and TV archives in the world and as all these 
defaultprogrammes
default h
defaultave been paid for by 
defaultlicence
default fee payers, it would be wrong to charge the British public any more to continue to enjoy them.
default8
default              
default              
defaultIt would seem that the BBC is poor at spending money wisely on developing technology.
default9
default              
defaultThe BBC should be publicly funded but i
defaultt has grown too big, is out of control, and shows little concern for the way it spends public money.
default10
default              
defaultThere ought to be. But, does Channel 4 spend its public funds more wisely?
default11
default              
defaultThe arrangements in the UK, though not faultless, are infinitely prefera
defaultble to those in the US.
default12
default              
defaultThe BBC is too vast and unmanageable, and it has become careless and out of control. It lacks vision and focus. Like the NHS, it seems to be over managed and to be pointing in too many directions. It needs to aim at doing less, 
defaultbut doing it more skillfully and enthusiastically. 
defaultAnd with less public money.
default13
default              
defaultProbably not. Would a 5 yearly review be a possibility? As with parliament, if the governors are making a mess of things, it would be an improvement to be able to make signi
defaultficant changes every 5 years.
