[[[Research Councils UK (WSC023)]]]Research Councils UK (RCUK) believe that investment in attracting, training and managing the next generation of world-class researchers makes a major contribution to the impact of research and benefits the economic and social wellbeing of the UK.We will use our position and influence to lead cultural change in the HE sector, in particular through our support for the Vitae® Programme and the Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers, and the development of our recently published statement of expectations (see below) which describes how we expect those in receipt of our funding to promote and lead cultural change in relation to equality and diversity.Our vision is:•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; to ensure that the best potential researchers from a diverse population are attracted into research careers•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; to enhance the quality of research training and the employability of early stage researchers•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; to enhance the impact of UK researchers by promoting improved career development and management of research staff by research organisations.&#xa0;&#xa0;An organization’s success and competitiveness depends on its ability to embrace diversityand draw on the skills, understanding and experience of its people. The potential rewards ofdiversity are significant: recruiting staff from the widest possible pool will unlock talent andmake a major contribution to the impact of research and will benefit the economic and socialwellbeing of the UK. RCUK expects that equality and diversity therefore is embedded at alllevels and in all aspects of normal research practice.&#xa0;RCUK expect those in receipt of Research Council funding to:&#xa0;•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; promote and lead cultural change in relation to equalities and diversity •&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; engage staff at all levels with improving the promotion of equality and diversity•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; ensure all members of the research workforce are trained and supported to address  disincentives and indirect obstacles to recruitment, retention and progression in research careers•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; provide evidence of ways in which equality and diversity issues are managed at both an institutional and department level&#xa0;Why do numbers of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder?&#xa0;When women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? What are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in different employment sectors?What should universities and the higher education sector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice?&#xa0;What role should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers?
