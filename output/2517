defaultThe Residential Landlords Associatio
defaultn (RLA) is the premier national
default 
defaultlandlords association
default operating in Engl
defaultand and Wales. We have some 14,5
default00 subscribers repres
defaultenting a membership of around 17
default,000. Our members own o
defaultr control over 2
default50
default,
default0
default00 units of accommodation. Primarily our members are landlords in their own right but a number are managing and letting agents, some of whom are also landlords. Our members operate in all sub-sectors of the Private Rented Sector (PRS). Properties are rente
defaultd out to families, working people, young professionals, the elderly, students and benefit customers.

defaultIn summary, o
defaultur concerns about the new arrangements 
defaultrelating to Universal Credit are as follows:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWe look at some of the issues further below.
default&#xa0;
default2.2. 
defaultIn the longer term
default:
default&#xa0;
defaulta. There needs to be wider, longer term view of the place of 
defaulthousing benefits;
default&#xa0;
defaultb. It is 
defaultvital to retain the involvement of private landlords in housing provision to benefit claimants
default,
default par
defaultticularly the low paid in work;
default&#xa0;
defaultc. 
defaultBreaking the link between benefit rates and
default market rents is a key concern;
default&#xa0;
defaultd. 
defaultHousing conditions will deteriorate if 
defaultbenefit leve
defaultls do not reflect market rents; and,
default&#xa0;
defaulte. 
defaultIncreasing housing supply is vital. 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default3.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe introduction of Universal Credit
default, particularly around housing costs
default is of particular concern
default to our members as a significant
default number 
defaultlet their
default properties to tenants in receipt of benefits
default. Some operate by choice in this subsector of the market
default or because circumstances dictate this
default. Others become involved because their tenants suffer a change of circumstances, particularly unemployment, which means that they have to claim welfare benefits. 
defaultThis latter group are 
defaultinvoluntary landlords of benefit cust
defaultomers.
default&#xa0;
default3.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultConcerns are not just about
default Universal Credit. The welfare changes which are now in place threaten the provision of housing in the private rented sector to the less well off.  These will be carried throug
defaulth into Universal Credit.  This I
defaultnquiry provides the opportunity to take a longer
default term view. Paying down the deficit is important but as the economy improves longer term decisions are needed about ways in which the private rented sector will play its increasingly important role in housing the less we
defaultll off.
default&#xa0;
default3.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOur concerns
default around Univers
defaultal Credit
default fall under 
defaultfive
default 
defaultkey themes:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.4. 
default              
defaultWe
default acknowledge that the government has listened to stakeholders like ourselves; there are further issues to be addressed as outlined above. T
defaulthe RLA agree that the objective of helping tenants manage their financial affairs is a laudable 
defaultone.  However, this c
defaultomes at considerable risk.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default4.1.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe need fordefault cleardefault communicationdefault betweendefault DWP, defaultldefaultandlords and Local Authoritiesdefault&#xa0;default4.1.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultL
defaultast year the RLA and 
defaultthe Scottish Association of Landlords (
defaultSAL
default)
default conducted a survey of member
defaults to assess attitudes towards Universal Credit. Between 22
defaultnd
default October and 5
defaultth
default November 2012, 1,023 landlords from across the UK took part in the survey.  Results showed that 65.2 per cent of respondents do not support the Government’s plans for universal credit
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.1.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe would urge the Government to be open in their communication with 
defaultprivate landlords regarding Universal Credit to offer reassurance
default to attempt to change this negative perception
default.  With the demand for social housing at an all-time high
default,
default benefit customers are increasingly being encouraged to look to the Private rented sect
defaultor for an alternative to council or hous
defaulting association accommodation.
default&#xa0;
default4.1.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe needs, worries and views of 
defaultLandlords must be considered
default by DWP
default if
default the housing costs part of
default Universal Credit is to 
defaultbe successful. If 
defaultl
defaultandlords decide that they will not support th
defaulte welfare changes the 
defaultless well-off 
defaulttenants will suffer due to a lack of housing options available to them. 
defaultThis will simply put more pressure on an already
default over stretched housing supply.
default&#xa0;
default4.1.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLandlords
default must feel supported through this 
defaulttransition of 
defaultbudgeting 
defaultresponsibility being given to the tenant and must feel able to access the help and support that they may need if things don’t work out. At the moment Universal Credit is a major worry for Landlords - the Gove
defaultrnment cannot ignore this fact and they must pro
defaultvide a resource that can accommoda
defaultte for challenges and queries.
default&#xa0;
default4.1.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe feel that Landlords should be 
defaultable to see how a claim is progressing. 
defaultThe current proposals offer no 
defaultprovision for landlords to c
defaultheck that a claim has been made and there is no 
defaultnotification system so that landlords know that a c
defaultlaim for housing costs 
defaultis actually being paid, which could lead to
default further
default apprehension in the sector.
default&#xa0;
default4.2.    defaultLack of clarity around the default‘guidance’ thatdefault will replace regulationdefault&#xa0;default4.2.1. 
defaultThe RLA will o
defaultbvio
defaultusly strive to support its
default members through this 
defaultperiod of transition
default 
defaultbut 
defaultthe RLA
default,
default 
defaultand othe
defaultr l
defaultandlord
default 
defaulttrade 
defaultassociations
default,
default can only do this w
defaultith clear guidelines.  This will present a challenge as 
defaultthe existing system of regulations 
defaultbegins
default to disappear.  Decisions as to 
defaulthow 
defaultpayment will be made
default will be based
default individually on a case-by-
defaultcase basis 
defaultaccording to guidance
default.  
defaultIf Landlords cannot access information about progress of claims then they will not be willing to take claimants on as tenant
defaults in the first place.
default&#xa0;
default4.2.2. 
defaultWe feel that too much 
defaultdepend
defaults
default on how efficient
defaultly
default 
defaultDWP administers the new system. 
defaultLandlords may have to wait longer for payment with increased risk of d
defaultefault. 
defaultThe greater interval between payments, however, poses r
defaultisks. 
defaultIt is not at all clear 
defaulthow advance payments will work.
default&#xa0;default4.2.3. 
defaultAnother concern for the RLA and its members is the 
defaulthuge risk
default that comes with having
default a
default new
default 
defaultscheme heavily dependent on as yet untried computer systems. 
default Given that the intention is for 
defaultthe 
defaultUnive
defaultrsal Credit system to 
defaultbe digital when possible 
defaultthis is understandably leaving us wondering how this
default will all work out in practice.
default&#xa0;
default4.2.4. 
defaultWe feel that until these uncertainties are addressed by government and tangible guidance is offered around housing co
defaultsts and payment of rent within 
defaultUniversal Credit, l
defaultandlords will continue to be wary of the welfare changes. 
default&#xa0;
default4.3. default   defaultLack of protectiondefault for ldefaultandlord’s interests and financial stabilitydefault&#xa0;
default4.3.1. 
defaultWe feel that there is a common misconception that Landlords in the private rented sector are profiteering from housing benefit. 
defaultThis 
defaultis not the case. According to DCLG's most recent Landlord Survey from 2010
default, 
default79 per cent
default of all landlords earned less than a
default quarter of their income from letting properties in the private rented sector with 2
default1 per cent
default of all landlords earning no income at all.
default We therefore feel it unfair that under the new proposals there are no means of redress for landlords if things go wro
defaultng or no rights of appeal
default as
default potentially 
defaultl
defaultandlords could be left worse off than under the current system
default.  
defaultWe feel that the need for security of income on the landlord’s part
default is still an issue on which private landlords at large require reassurance
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.3.2
default. 
defaultImportant
defaultly, for the PRS the Government is pursuing a policy of using Universal Credit
default to improve financial responsibility and financial ma
defaultnagement skills on the part of c
defaultlaimants.  Whilst we feel that this is a worthwhile exercise in all other parts of 
defaulta claimant’s life, a home is the one thing that needs to be stable for the individual to prosper.  Simulating a monthly salary to benefits claimant
defaults is a risky strategy when a significant number 
defaultwill have bee
defaultn used to weekly rent payments. 
default 
defaultCurrently, p
defaultayment of different benefits at different times of the month also helps these tenants to budget. 
default The long wait between payments and inexperience of money management with benefit claimants could have serious implications on bot
defaulth the landlord and the tenant
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.3.3. 
defaultIt is not fair to expect that a private landlord will 
defaultbe able to absorb the cost and risk of mounting rent arrears compared with a large social landlord as many simply do not operate on that scale or have resources as back up when things go wrong
default. 
defaultMost importantly, they do not have any public subsidy for providing housing for those tenants who would normally rent with a social landlord. 
default&#xa0;
default4.3.4. 
defaultWe appreciate that the intention is that those who cannot manage their own financial affairs or are unl
defaultikely to pay rent should be identified as being vulnerable at
default the outset and arrangements will t
defaulthen
default be
default made which can include direct payment to the landlord.  
defaultThe
default system of vulnerability should be assessed according to the tenant’s interest of keeping a ro
defaultof over their head and the landlord’s interest to receive the money, as well as the public interest of making sure that the benefit is u
defaultsed for its intended purpose. We do question how robust these mechanics currently are.
default&#xa0;
default4.4.    defaultThe greater risk of incrdefaulteasing rent adefaultrrears and homelessness overalldefault&#xa0;default4.4.1. 
defaultThe
default introduction of the Local Housing Allowance and the resulting switch to paying benefit to the tenant instead of direct to the landlord has already had profound implications and landlords have reported increasing problems with arrears.  This ca
defaultn only get w
defaultorse when Universal Credit is rolled out nationally and we would urge the government to listen to the concerns of our members. 
defaultWe remain strongly of the view that
default the tenant should be offered the choice to receive their housing cots directly or for them to
default be paid directly to the landlord.
default&#xa0;
default4.5. default   defaultMonthly paymentsdefault&#xa0;
default4.5.1. 
defaultWe have concerns for tenants who could face budgetary challenges as all of their benefit payments are 
defaultcombined into one monthly sum
default. The long wait between payments and inexperience of 
defaultmoney management could have serious implications on both the landlord and the tenant.   This could lead to the tenant not allocating and saving enough money to pay the rent and getting into debt and rent arrears.  It is essential therefore that the local s
defaultervice framework which is intended to provide budgetary support for claimants is designed with the private sector in mind not just the social sector.
default&#xa0;
default4.6. default   defaultEmphasis on the social sectordefault&#xa0;
default4.6.1. 
defaultWe also feel that there is a lot of emphasis on ensuring that the social sector is prepared for the changes that will come with Universal Credit and how they will support their vulnerable tenants. This sector has the support 
defaultlocal authorities
default to ensure tha
defaultt they are delivering the programme as a partnership.  
defaultThe private rented sector must
default be incorporated into these local delivery partnerships
default effectively
default to prevent landlords from feeling disengaged.  
defaultPrivate landlords
default are very much a part of the local prov
defaultision of housing for the most vulnerable at a time when demand for social housing is high an
defaultd supply low. T
defaulto lose their support in the long term would have detrimental consequences on vulnerable tenants.  A consistent approach a
defaultcross all authorities is nee
defaultded –
default not a postcode lottery.
default&#xa0;
default5.       defaultRecommendationsdefault around Universal Creditdefault&#xa0;
default5.1.    
defaultWe would like to recommend the fo
defaultllowing to the 
defaultIn
defaultquiry:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default6.       defaultThe longer term effects of Welfare Reforms default&#xa0;default6.1.    
defaultWe feel that the welfare changes provide an opportunity to take a wider view on housing supply and ways to ensure that landlords
default in the private rented sector remain willing to continue to provide housing to benefit claimants who are out of work 
defaultor in work but on a low income.
default&#xa0;
default6.2.    
defaultIn terms of the amount of housing costs payable we recognise that the transfer of LHA into Univers
defaultal Credit is relatively seamless with no changes being made to how the rates
default are calculated. 
defaultHowever, we are concerned that by no longer linking local housing allowance rates to market rents there
default are two key wider implications:
default 
default&#xa0;
defaulta. 
defaultThose private landlord
defaults who only rent their properties to benefit claimants because of demand for low rent housing in their areas will not feel there is any incentive to
default continue to invest if the rates
default d
defaulto not rise with market rates. 
defaultThis will then add to the already shortage of
default affordable rental accommodatio
defaultn in the private rented sector.
default&#xa0;
defaultb. 
defaultHousing conditions will be compromised if landlords are not able to increase rent in line with other market rents and in a climate where the cost of living is rising
default. This will affect the way 
defaultlandlords maintain and repair their properties if they do not have the mone
defaulty to spend on their properties.
default&#xa0;
default6.3.    
defaultWe feel that the longer term willingness of private landlords to continue to rent to benefit claimants will be co
defaultmpromised as rents move away from market
default rents. We perceive the fixed one per cent
default maximum rise in rates for 2013/14 and 2014/15 as well as the Government
default’
defaults previous policy of
default linking rises in rates to the Consumer P
defaultr
defaultices I
defaultndex to be a major threat so far as sufficient provision of accommodation to claimants is concerned.  In many areas landlords are able to 
defaultswitch to non-benefit claimants;
default this is something that we have repeatedly warned of and we can back this up by our re
defaultcent survey findings. 
default&#xa0;
default6.4.    
defaultThis must be looked at in the wider context of housing supply. This is particularly true in L
defaultondon and other hotspots.  The G
defaultovernment contend
defaults that it is, 
defaultin effect
default,
default a large purchaser who can use reductions in rates to infl
defaultue
defaultnce the market. W
defaulte question this assertion
default,
default but
default,
default even if it is correct
default,
default it will not work in those areas where the landlord is able to let to a non-benefit claimant.  A far better way is to improve supply which will then let the market restrain rents. 
default&#xa0;
default6
default.5.     
defaultA key function of housing benefit must be support those
default working on low wages. As Beverid
defaultge pointed out
default,
default it is essential that rates of housing benefit reflect local rental market conditions.  If you are on low wages and you do not get this extra sup
defaultport what is the
default point in working at all?
default&#xa0;
default7.       defaultConclusion default&#xa0;default7.1. 
default   
defaultBoth
default the welfare reforms and the introduction of Universal Credit come with considerable risks. 
defaultThere is likely to be
default be a much higher level of arrears, an unwillingness of landlords 
defaultto house benefit claimants (at a time when there is huge pressure on social housing), increased unwillingness by banks to lend for this kind of property (or increased interest rate
defaults
default to reflect the risk), much higher levels of evictions and much greater hom
defaultelessness.
default&#xa0;
default7.2.    
defaultWe recognise
default that this is an evolving system
default.
default 
defaultWhat we do ask is that the C
defaultommittee an
defaultd the G
defaultovernment do not forget the risk that
default private
default landlords will be taking once Universal Credit is rolled out
default more widely and offer a workable system which encourages these landlords to participate in this important subsector of the housing market.
default&#xa0;
default7.3.    
defaultMore widely
default,
default th
defaulte government needs to recognise the long term necessity of providing less well-off tenants w
defaultith sufficient support for their housing costs in light of increasing pressures on incomes. Supply side reforms are vita
defaultl.

defaultAt one stage,

defaultthe temptation 
defaultof having large amounts of housing benefit provided to her directly 
defaultwas too great

defaultHis mother repeatedl

In addition, as recovering alcoholic, the temptation of the rent money being paid into his bank account proved too great and he subsequently suffered a relap
