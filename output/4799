defaultThe need for wider reform of the care systemdefault2.1.1.
default              
defaultThe proposed reforms address important issues of significant concern that were highlighted by the joint inquiry into children missing from care conducted by the APPG for runaway and missing children and adults and the APPG for looked after children and car
defaulte leavers. 
default2.1.2.
default              defaultRecommendation:default We believe that in order for these changes to be effective and to address the reasons why so many children experience a great number of unsuccessful placements, both in foster carer and children’s homedefaultsdefault, the reform must form part of a more comprehensive programme of change and cover children in foster placements as well as those living in residential care. default2.2.1

defaultLegislation and statutory piece
defaults
default of guidance on looked after children and care leavers require the provision of advocacy service
defaults
default to help children participate in 
defaultthe 
defaultdecision-
defaultmaking process. The APPG on looked after children and care leavers recently published a report 
defaultabout
default entitlements
default for looked after children and care leavers. The report highlighted that 
defaultthat very few looked after children and care leavers feel that they have all the information they need about their entitlements. Only 29% of children in care and 17% of care leavers f
defaulteel that they have all the information they need. Many children are not told about their entitlement to advocacy support and not all local authorities are commissioning such services. Two
default pieces of guidance that relate
default to the provisio
defaultn of advocacy services
default locally 
default–

default‘
defaultNational Advocacy Standards (2002) and 
defaultGet it Sorted: Guidance on Providing Effective Advocacy Services for Children and Young People making a Complaint under the Children Act 1989’- are out of date and appear to be archived on the DFE website.
default2.2.3     
defaultThe proposed reforms will be more effective if steps are taken to ens
defaulture that children’s needs are 
defaultat the centre of the decisions made about their placements and that children’s wishes and feelings are taken into consideration when decisions are made, including through the support of 
defaultan

defaultChildren who run away or go missing from caredefault2.3.2
default 
default              
defaultThe police have been rolling out new definitions of ‘absent’ and ‘missing’ 
defaultpeople 
defaultsince April 2013. We have expressed concerns that the implementation of the new definit
defaultions was not underpinned by an 
defaultevaluation of how children classified as ‘absent’, 
defaultinclu
defaultding children running away from children’s home or foster care, will be safeguarded under the new definition of ‘absent’. The University of Portsmouth has recently published research looking at how children ‘classified’ as ‘absent have been safeguarded in 
defaultpolice forces where the new def
defaultinitions have been implemented.

default2.3.3 
default 
default              
defaultThe report highlights issues of concern
default which include that
default that risk assessments are not robust
default enough
default, 
defaultthe 
defaultpolice do not routinely ask whether a child is on 
defaulta 
defaultchild protection order and 
defaultif they are vulnerable and,
default there is
default little involvement of Missing Persons C
defaulto-ordinators. The report also highlights the lack of training for call centre staff and other staff dealing with missing children around the signs of chi
defaultld sexual exploitation. 
default2.3.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default default              defaultRecommendation:default the Department for Educationdefault,default jointly with the Home Officedefault,default should review existing guidance in relation to the implementation of the new police definitions of ‘missing’ and ‘absent’default. They should defaultpropose clear defaultguidance to the police and carers of looked after children on how children classified as ‘absent’ should be safeguarded from the moment they are reported to the police by their families or carers through to when they retudefaultrn home after defaulta defaultmissing episode. default&#xa0;default2.3.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default    
defaultThe government has recently published 
defaulta 
defaultdraft Anti- Slavery bill. We believe that the bill offers an opportunity to address the needs of trafficked children. 
default&#xa0;default2.3.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRecommendation:default the ddefaultraft Anti-Slavery bill should be amended to include provision of an defaultindependent trusted adult – a guardiandefault- todefault support separated children and ensure that they have their voices heard in decisions that affect them in care and legal processes. defaultThey should ensuredefault that these children are placed in appropriate placements that meet their needs.  default&#xa0;default3.1 
default              
default              
defaultWe welcome the proposed reforms to the regulation of residential children’s homes. We believe these reforms can contribute to makin
defaultg residential children’s homes safer places and improve protection measures for vulnerable children placed there, such as children who are at risk of child sexual exploitation and children who run away or go missing from care.
default3.2. 
default              
default              
defaultThe proposed reforms address important issues of significant concern that were highlighted by the joint inquiry into children missing from care conducted by the APPG for runaway and missing children and adults and the APPG for looked after children and car
defaulte leavers. We believe that in order for these changes to be effective, they must form part of a more comprehensive programme of change 
defaultthat is 
defaultfocussed on improving support for children in care and underpinned by a wider programme of reform to improve plac
defaultement stability for children in care and to ensure a greater focus on and scrutiny of how the needs of individual children are met.
default3.3.  
default              
defaultWe welcome the requirement for staff working in children’s homes to be adequately trained
default,
default but recommend that these p
defaultroposals need to be strengthened further. Staff should be required to obtain qualifications and have adequate training around managing risks, dealing with challenging behaviour and listening to and communicating with children before they are recruited to w
defaultork in children’s homes. 
default3.4.  
default              
defaultThe focus on children’s homes and children placed out of authority in children’s homes is welcome
default,
default but we believe that the reforms should be extended to cover children in foster placements, particularly out of authority placements. 
default3.5.
default              
default              
defaultIt is important that Ofsted have appropriate oversight and monitoring of how the changes are implemented by local a
defaultuthorities through single looked after children and child protection inspection. 
default3.6.
default              
default              
defaultChildren's wishes, views and experiences must have greater prominence in the proposed reforms through improved access to advocacy in statutory reviews and independent r
defaulteturn interviews following running away episodes. 
default3.7.
default              default              defaultThe specific needs of trafficked children are not adequately considered in these reforms. We believe that the government should implement changes to protect and safeguard these vulnerable children
default. 
defaultThey should do this
default by: establishing a national system of data collection on trafficked children; providing training to staff in residential care homes regarding the indicators of trafficking and how to support trafficked children; developing a system of i
defaultndependent trusted adults to support separated children and ensure that they have their voices heard in decisions that affect them in care and legal processes; and ensuring that these children are placed in appropriate placements that meet their needs.
