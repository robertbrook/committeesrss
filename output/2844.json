"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) (WRT 023)&#xa0;Summary &#xa0;1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe\n welcome the opportunity to provide written evidence to the Transport Select Committee inquiry into winter resilience in transport.\n \nOur response specifically looks at resilience on Britain’s mainline rail network, but will also make reference to undergroun\nd\n, light railway\n and tram systems.\n \n \n&#xa0;\n2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) is the combined economic regulator for Britain’s mainline railways and the health and safety regulator for all Britain’s railways. As an independent regulator, we play a pivotal role\n in ensuring the industry delivers a safe, effective and efficient system for Government and other funders, tax payers and customers - both passengers and freight.\n \n \n&#xa0;\n3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSpecifically, we regulate and \nmonitor the performance of Network Rail, as stewards of the\n mainline network. We set and monitor targets that determine obligations and funding for a five year control period - for example, performance targets which measure the percentage of trains arriving on time and the \nnumber\n of services which are \ncancelled an\nd significantly late (CaSL).\n \nAll of these are important when considering the resilience of the network to adverse weather and the impact this causes to rail customers. Following previous\n concerns\n, in 2012, we improved the provision of information for passengers by introducing a new licence condition to require operators to provide accurate and timely information to help \npassengers\n better plan their journeys –\n \nespecially relevant during times of di\nsruption.\n \nWe monitor performance against this and can take appropriate enforcement action if required.\n&#xa0;\n4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur response to this particular inquiry can be summarised as follows: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow resilient are the UK’s transport networks (including road, rail and air) to adverse winter weather? How well prepared are the Government, local authorities and transport providers for adverse winter weather? What more should be done to ensure a coordinated response?&#xa0;\n5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOn the mainline railway network, where rail freight traffic is up 17% since 2000-01 and passenger numbers are up 45% in the last deca\nde, customers expect and rely on the network to deliver for them all year round.\n \nRail infrastructure is inherently vulnerable to weather – particularly adverse winter weather.\n \nWithout necessary work to ensure resilience, \nit is\n susceptible to failure\ns \ncausing delays and disruption. This not only is frustrating for\n passengers, but delays to freight trains\n during adverse cold weather\n affect the supply of coal to Britain’s power stations. Network Rail is working to gain more understanding\n of how\n to improve\n its ability to manage its assets and undertake required targeted maintenance, but there is still more work to be done to ensure rail performance is not adversely affected.\n \nThere have been recent positive signs of improvement\n:\n the cross\n-\nindustry approach t\no the issue and opportunity to design\n-\nin ‘research\n-\nbased’ solutions for new infrastructure is particularly welcomed.\n&#xa0;\n6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs we have seen, UK weather patterns are changing. Network Rail need\ns\n to adapt their plans for both infrastructure and operations to meet \nthe challenge posed by this on the railway – particularly taking forward learning from \nprevious incidents\n.\n \nTo increase resilience of rail assets to adverse weather such as extremes of temperature, rainfall and wind, adequate drainage and maintenance is req\nuired.\n \n Without this maintenance the infrastructure is subject to failures.\n \n During 2012 there was an increase in the number and severity of earthwork failures (emban\nkments and slopes which slip\n during bad weather), which were mostly associated with heavy \nrainfall.\n \nTable 1 shows the close correlation between rainfall and earthwork failures.\n&#xa0;\nTable 1 Close correlation between high rainfall and landslips in 2010-13&#xa0;\n7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInfrastructure \nfailures increase potential safety risks and put a heavier reliance on \nproactive inspection and maintenance to identify and control those risks.\n \nFor example, in 2012 ORR served an \nenforcement notice in Scotland \n which required Network Rail to carry out risk assessment on earthwork failures and implement control measures such\n as speed restrictions on parts of a route to reduce the risk of train derailment due to failed earthworks.\n \nWhile reactive control measures can help manage the overall safety risk, they are only an interim measure before more proactive and sustainable resi\nlience and climate change solutions are \nrequir\ned.\n \n&#xa0;\n8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nORR’s scrutiny suggests that Network Rail should identify locations which are particularly vulnerable\n to flooding\n and\n,\n rather than replacing assets ‘like for like’, conventional ballast which is easily washed away could be replaced with concrete slabs to support the track and electrical cabinets could be raised above ground level.\n \nThis opportunity to \n“design-\nin\n”\n solutions\n would increase resilience and recovery times following an incident.\n \n&#xa0;\n9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nprecursor indicator model (PIM),\n developed by\n \nthe industry’s Rail Safety and Standards Board\n \n(\nRSSB\n)\n, shows that following\n improvements\n between 2006-09, risk reduction levelled\n-\noff \nbetween 2009 and 2011; and increased 34% between December 2011 and December 2012 because of weather-caused infrastructure failure. However, we have seen improvement in overall precursor risk reduction trend more recently: it reduced 4% since the start of 2\n013-14.\n \n&#xa0;\n10.\n \nWinter and adverse weather-caused risks also pose similar infrastructure and rolling stock-related risks to Britain’s tram\n,\n \nlight rail \nand underground \nnetworks.\n \nAs these services are often urban in na\nture\n they are less susceptible to weather and \ntemperature\n-caused\n risks, \nbut \nstaff not being able to get to work, or being in the wrong place to do their jobs\n,\n remains a common risk\n. However, running such services, particularly trams, is dependent on road surfaces being cleared of snow and ice.\n&#xa0;\n11.\n \nIn its \nStrategic Business Plan for 2014-2019\n \nand \nresponse to the \nD\nraft determination,\n \nNetwork Rail recognised the need to improve the resilience of the rail infrastructure systems to weather\n,\n to increase reliability and mitigate the risks associated with\n climate change. \nIt is\n seeking to develop “considered evidence-based adaptation strategies” for the UK rail infrastructure focused on key questions:\n&#xa0;\nNetwork\n Rail also has a programme of work to \nmake their assets more resilient to climate change and extreme weather\n – for example targeted work with local water management groups to improve the management of drainage and earthworks.\n&#xa0;\n12.\n \nIn response to the Climate \nChange Act 2008, Network Rail, in conjunction with RSSB has undertaken research to understand and mitigate against likely future climate change scenarios. They have established the Weather Resilience &amp; Climate Change Steering Group (WRCCSG) to develop and \ndeliver a strategy to manage the risk of weather and climate change impact\ns\n on rail performance, in order to achieve the vision of a ‘weather-ready railway’. \n&#xa0;\n13.\n \nThis cross-industry approach is welcomed and ORR would like to see more widespread co-operation \nand collaboration between Network Rail and other railway operators to ensure targeted investment is made to make assets more resilient to severe weather. To encourage this, we are actively working with industry \nthrough groups including\n the \nSustainable Deve\nlopment Steering Group (SDSG), \nRail Delivery Group (RDG) and National Task Force (NTF).\n&#xa0;\n14.\n \nWith\n continued investment by Government in the rail industry, there is the opportunity to “design-in” improved resilience to deal with current and future weather extremes.\n \nThe industry has taken advantage of a range of evidence from European partner railways w\nhere infrastructure has been exposed to extreme heat, cold\n,\n wind and water.\n \nThis has allowed the development of a detailed environmental specification for the European Rail Traffic Management System Programme. It has also enabled climate resilience to be a\nddressed in \nthe specification for the forthcoming electrification of the western route.\n&#xa0;15.\n \nWe have stepped up our monitoring of Network Rail to ensure that it takes a more proactive approach to weather resilience and the adverse effect this has on \nperformance and the delays and disruption incurred by passengers and freight customers.\n \nOur Final Determination for 2014-2019 propose\ns\n a number of national level targets. These were set out in our \nDraft Determination\n and include monitoring Network Rail’s \noverall capability and speed of progress in managing its assets, the quality of the asset data it collects, the success of internal asset management programmes and the condition, performance and failure of each asset type.\n \n&#xa0;\n16.\n \nThere is further evidence that \nthe industry and Network Rail in particular are responding to the issues posed by severe weather.\n \nNetwork Rail has developed \na route-level \nplan\n for the western route, and we expect Network Rail to publish \nroute-level\n resilience and recovery plans by Septem\nber 2014 for all routes.\n \nRecovery plans are essential, but rely on staff being able to travel to work in order to implement them.\n \nSome operators put up key staff in local hotels to reduce\n such\n risk\n \nhowever improved resilience across the whole transport sys\ntem would help to mitigate this further.\n \nWe will monitor closely the industry’s progress against delivering these, but we are aware that only real-life events can stress-test the plans.\n \n&#xa0;\nWhat lessons have been learned since the severe weather experienced in the winter of 2009-10? What practical changes have been made to ensure the UK is now better equipped to deal with severe weather?&#xa0;\n17.\n \nWhile rail customers suffered less disruption than road travellers during the winter of 2010-11, significant lessons have \nbeen learnt right across the rail\nway\n industry.\n \nDuring this period – in particular during the heavy snow\n – \nthe rail industry adopted a pragmatic “get people home” approach, operating emergency timetables rather than trying to meet regulatory performance tar\ngets.\n \nThere has been considerable work across the rail industry to define practical measures that could be implemented both by Network Rail as the infrastructure operator and the train operating companies (TOCs) to improve railway future resilience.\n&#xa0;\n18.\n \nThe s\nnow in winter 2010-11 was particularly severe in Scotland.\n Some delays were caused by frozen points and snowdrifts, but one of the most significant problems was a build-up of compacted ice on the underside of trains. This could take six hours to defrost be\nfore basic safety checks and engineering work\n could take place. More than seventy\n \ntrains needed to be withdrawn from service after carriages were damaged by ice in Scotland alone.\n&#xa0;\n19.\n \nFollowing the events of 2010, First ScotRail\n visited Helsinki, Finland, where heated power showers are routinely used to remove compacted snow and ice from carriages during the winter. In 2011, they trialed this approach using heated showers in poly\n-\ntunnels to enable trains to be defrosted more quic\nkly. \nFollowing the success of this, they have been incorporated into ScotRail\n’s\n depots on a permanent basis and a three-carriage diesel train can now be defrosted in less than two hours.\n&#xa0;\n20.\n \nRail services in south London\n,\n which use a third-rail power supply s\nystem, were also affected during the severe snow of 2010-11.\n \nSince 2010 an extensive winter resilience progr\namme has been adopted, including\n the design and installation of conductor rail\n \nheating and the development of dedicated anti-snow and ice-treatment \ntrains.\n \nSome of Southeastern’s class 375 trains have also been f\nitted with de-icing fluid tanks,\n which can apply \nde-icing\n fluid to the rails\n when required in service.\n&#xa0;\n21.\n \nThe industry has not just focused on mitigating the effects of the snow seen in 2010 but\n has also looked at how to better deal with the disruption to train services from other extreme weather.\n \nFollowing the flooding in November and December 2012 in south west England and Wales, Network Rail carried out a review of infrastructure resilience an\nd the root\n-\ncauses of failure and disruption on the western route. From this work, \nthirty seven \nsites were identified as contributing to 96% of the delays and specifically nine locations were identified for targeted work to improve resilience.\n \nThis work is \nscheduled to take place between 2013 and 2016.\n \n&#xa0;\n22.\n \nNetwork Rail has recently retendered its contract for the maintenance and supply\n \nof its specialised\n \nautumn and winter fleet of rail vehicles designed to keep the railway open during severe weather. Network \nRail has carried out site visits to each depot to assess the current maintenance facilities to establish their suitability for the operation of autumn and winter services. Each depot now has a full summary of works.\n \nORR’s safety inspectors have also inspec\nted train operators management systems to better manage train wheels slipping on rails following leaf-fall in the autumn and when dew forms on the railhead. \n&#xa0;\n23.\n \nThe provision of information to passengers during adverse weather has significantly improved sinc\ne winter 2010.\n \nFrom March 2012\n ORR introduced a new operator licence condition to set out responsibilities and ensure that passengers had access to up to date reliable information to help plan and make their journeys - particularly during severe disruption\n.\n \nIn our associated \nregulatory statement\n we set out how we expected the industry to comply with the\n code of practice on the provision of information to passengers during disruption.\n \nThis sets the following requirements\n:\n&#xa0;\n24.\n \nThe industry has responded positively.\n \nAs detailed in our\n De\ncember 2012 report into passenger information,\n \nmany station staff now have smart phones with access to real-time data, while ticket office staff have better access to up to date information.\n \nWhile this still requires stress-testing in a live situation, th\ne level and quality of information for passengers at stations, online and through social media has and continues to improve across the industry.\n \n \nThe indus\ntry \nupdate their plans annually \nand \nto take into account developments in technology, changes to \npassenger needs and lessons learnt in the light of experience. ORR\n \nengages with industry and \nmonitors\n \nperformance to ensure that all parties fulfil their obligations and in 2014 we intend to review the current code to identify whether further improvements \nare required.\n \nIn addition, the £100\nm\n fund for station improvements in 2014-19 could be used to improve passenger information systems, however this would need to be considered against competing us\nes\n for the fund and decided under the governance procedures.\n&#xa0;\n25.\n \nDuring times of severe weather, passengers often have to make sophisticated travel decisions, taking into consideration the full range of travel modes available to the\nm –\n \nfor example, rail, road, bus, car or\n \nworking\n from home. While the availability and quality of rail information has improved, the passenger experience\n, it\n could be \nfurther \nimproved by \nproviding \neasier access to local and regional cross-modal transport information. This would enable customers to compr\nehensively plan their journey with\n the\n confidence that they have information about all of the travel options open to them. The \nDepartment for Transport\n has set out its view on the value of cross-modal information in the\nir\n recent \nstrategy; \n“\nDoor to Door – a\n strategy for improving sustainable transport.”\n \nWe believe that access to cross-modal transport information is particularly important in times of service disruption and are actively encouraging the industry to continue to make data available to third-part\ny data developers who could develop software applications to provide this functionality\n to the travelling public\n.\n \n \n&#xa0;\n26.\n \nORR places significant \nweight\n on ensuring that the mainline railway delivers for all of its customers and funders; and hopefully the information provided will be useful in informing your inquiry.\nIf clarification of any of the points made above is required, or we can be of further as\nsistance to the inquiry, please do not hesitate to contact me\n.\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n CaSL\n measures the number of trains which are cancelled ( completely or terminated before destination) or significantly late (delays over 30 minutes)\n Network Rail Strategic Business Plan \nwww.networkrail.co.uk/publications/strategic-business-plan-for-cp5/\n OR\nR Investigation into Network Rail breach \nwww.rail-reg.gov.uk/server/show/nav.2961\n Draft determination \nwww.rail-reg.gov.uk/pr13/consultations/draft-determination.php\n \nSource: mainline railway industry’s Safety Management Information System and Centre for Ecology and Hydrology \n Enforcement notice \n \nwww.rail-reg.gov.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.8104\n \n The\n PIM is currently produced quarterly by the \nRail Safety &amp; Standards Board (RSSB), and calculates the current train accident risk profile and associated trends using precursor event data (such as lan\ndslips infrastructure failures)\n Network Rail Strategic B\nusiness Plan \nwww.networkrail.co.uk/publications/strategic-business-plan-for-cp5/\n Network Rail Draft Determination response  \nwww.networkrail.co.uk/publications/delivery-plans/control-period-5/resp\nonse-to-the-draft-determination\n Draft Determination \nwww.r\nail-reg.gov.uk/pr13/consultations/draft-determination.php\n \nORR/\n Network Rail p\nassenger information during disruption\n \nwww.rail-reg.gov.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.10324\n Regulatory st\natement passenger information \nwww.rail-reg.gov.uk/server/show/nav.2738\n Passenger Information Code of practice\n \nhttp://www.atoc.org/clientfiles/files/ACOP015v3%20-%20PIDD%20(2).pdf\n December 2012 Passenger Information report \nwww.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/pdf/Passenger-information.pdf\n DfT Strategy DFT Strategy Door to Door - \nww\nw.gov.uk/government/publications/door-to-door-strategy\n"
