"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the Police and Crime Commissioner for Gloucestershire [CST0044]&#xa0;&#xa0;\nThank you for you\nr\n letter regarding the \nPublic Administration Select Committee’s \ncurrent\n inquiry into crime statistics.  In answer to your questions, I can respond as follows:\n&#xa0;\n1.\n              \nI have set the Gloucestershire Constabulary no targets: they only have the one target set by t\nhe Home Secretary to reduced crime.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n              \nNational Crime Recording Standards (NCRS) and National Standards for Incident Recording (NSIR) audits are undertaken regularly and reported to Chief Officers and my Office both directly and through an Executive Perfo\nrmance Summary. \n&#xa0;\nAudit results across 2013 from Gloucestershire show that 91% of crimes that should be recorded are recorded. \n&#xa0;\nThis figure however fluctuates across the different crime categories, with 96% of acquisitive crimes recorded and 88% of violent\n crimes recorded. As for the classification of crimes, Gloucestershire currently has upwards of 95% of offences categorised correctly.\n&#xa0;\n This is due in the most part to the way that the Constabulary has control of the recording of crimes within the Force Cr\nime Validation &amp; Evaluation Unit.\n&#xa0;\nThe audit process was changed early in 2013 from solely looking at thematic (one crime type at a time) to a regular overall audit.\n&#xa0;\n 400 incidents are looked at every month, split by crime types. Three things are measured:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThis review and change in practice and regular reporting gives\n me confidence in the crime statistics for Gloucestershire to the extent indicated above.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n"
