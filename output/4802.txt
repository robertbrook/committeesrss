[[[ime statistics for your area?]]]North Wales Police employ a “Crime Registrar” whose role it is to monitor and audit recorded crime figures. The Registrar maintains an Audit Plan, which is used to ensure that North Wales Police follows a consistent and accurate process to record crime.  Information from the Audit Plan is shared directly with my Office.  In November 2013, I raised the national issue of the integrity of police crime statistics at a Senior Executive Board meeting.  (The Senior Executive Board is the key forum where, amongst other things, I hold the Chief Constable to account).  I explained the importance of scrutinising crime recording processes and that as North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner I must be satisfied that these processes are fit for purpose. On 4th December 2013 I received a briefing by the Chief Superintendent of Corporate Services to explain the processes North Wales Police use to ensure the robustness of their crime recording activity.North Wales Police have a Crime Recording User Group which is chaired and attended by senior officers within the Force.  The terms of reference for the group include the following:

[[[Aims and Objectives ]]]&#xa0;It is now agreed that my Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner attend that meeting for scrutiny purposes.I have long been aware that the principles North Wales Police apply to their crime recording processes are not necessarily applied to the same extent in other police forces.  This has sometimes led to comparatively less favourable crime statistics for North Wales and is a matter that has been raised by North Wales Police and myself with HMIC.  From what we know at present there is nothing to indicate that we should not trust the crime statistics maintained by North Wales Police.  However, as stated above we are in the process of increasing scrutiny with regard to this subject.&#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
