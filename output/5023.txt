&#xa0;Written evidence from Sandra Sanderson [PCC Progress 15]&#xa0;1. The role of Police and Crime Panels in holding their commissioners to account:&#xa0;The PCC in County X has demonstrated a low level of commitment, in practice, to equal opportunities.  For example: recruiting staff to his/her office without any regard to equally opportunities recruitment and selection processes, thus setting a very poor example as a senior public servant.&#xa0;Also awarding grants under the Local Policing Fund: The PCC gave a significant grant to one local group to before even launching the application process.  Many local organisations were then refused awards on the basis that there was insufficient funding. It is difficult to avoid the appearance of favouritism.&#xa0;It does not appear that the Police and Crime Panel are able to hold the Commissioner to account in areas of equal opportunities and fairness.  &#xa0;2. The role of Commissioners in budget and precept setting:  Again the administration of the Local Policing Fund where a significant grant was given out to one organisation before others where even able to access the application form.  This gives rise to concerns around the Commissioner’s attitude to the budget.  &#xa0;3. Effectiveness of Commissioners in promoting local policing priorities:&#xa0;There has been some consultation in our area around the PCC’s priorities.  However, the major consultation meeting was extremely disappointing for those participating.  Whereas significant dissent was expressed at the consultation meeting, the notes suggested a much greater agreement with the PCC’s plans.  Further, consultation with the third sector has looked very much like a fait accompli.  It was very clear to everyone present that the PCC has decided what the priorities are and it is difficult to avoid the appearance that the consultation is merely a case of “going through the motions.”  For instance, the Commissioner’s office had undertaken a “mapping exercise” of all the third sector agencies involved with crime and crime reduction work.  At the consultation meeting this map was produced but it did not include any of the county hate crime partnerships – despite the fact that these are voluntary sector led partnerships receiving significant funding from the respective Crime Reduction Partnerships and the County Council.&#xa0;The PCC has made it clear that he/she fully supports the notion of a single gateway for victims his/her consultation with the voluntary sector appears mostly to focus on how this may operate, not on the more fundamental questions of whether it is desirable or necessary.  &#xa0;Please note we do not feel able to identify the County as we are an organisation who will be seeking funds from the PCC and fear that if he/she knows we have criticised him/her in this consultation this might affect his/her funding decisions.&#xa0;Sandra SandersonDecember 2013&#xa0;
