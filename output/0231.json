"Written evidence submitted by Professor Niamh Nic Daeid (FSS040)Executive Summary to response:My response is a personal rather than one representing my organisation.  I have limited my comments to matters \nprimarily focusing on research and accreditation.  There are 3 major issues;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nBiographyProfessor Niamh Nic Daeid is professor of Forensic Science at the Centre for Forensic Science, University of Strathclyde.  She has been involved in forensic science \ncase work, \neducation, professional practitioner training (both UK and overseas), foren\nsic science research and \nprofessional development \nfor 19 years.  She is the past editor in chief of Science and Justice (one of only a handful of forensic science dedicated international peer reviewed journals worldwide) and sat on council, including as an office\n bearer (executive council) of\n the Forensic Science Society for 9 years.  During her time on council she managed and ran all of the Society’s professional postgraduate diplomas and administered their research scholarship scheme.  Professor Nic Daeid also chairs the European Network of Forensic Institutes (ENFSI) working group for fire and explosion investigation (representing 63 Forensic science institutes and laboratories from across Europe).  She sits on the Interpol organising committee for the forensic science managers symposium involving the directors of all 190 Interpol represented countries and coordinates the final production of the 3 year forensic science research review for that symposium . Prof. Nic Daeid also acts as a consultant for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).  She runs a large multidisciplinary research group dedicated to various aspects of forensic science research in close collaboration with practitioners across the criminal justice system.  Her research team \nhas \nthe largest peer review publication output in the UK\n.   She has published 115 peer re\nviewed papers (go\nogle scholar), 10 book chapters, \n5 edited book\ns and\n 125 conference presentations.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nConsultation response to Science and Technology Committee follow-up inquiry into Forensic Science.This response reflect personal views and not necessarily the views of my organisation.  I have no interests to declare.\n&#xa0;\n              \n1.1\n              Effective strategy for forensic science: Forensic Science in England and Wales is delivered by forensic science providers accredited by UKAS and, increasingly, by in-house forensic services within police forces. Some in-house police forensic science laboratories have become accredited, and others are moving towards accreditation, however there remains no statutory requirement for them to do so. Forensic Science Providers, on the other hand, are required under police procurement rules to have ISO17025 accreditation for their services.  \n              \n1.2\n              \nThere may be a risk that unaccredited in-house provision of forensic science may not be delivered to the same quality standards as that of the accredited forensic science providers. In-house delivery of forensic services may also contract the commercial forensic science market further as well as reducing access to forensic services at reasonable cost for the defence. \n              1.3\n              Support for forensic science research: The establishment of a Forensic Science Special Interest Group as a TSB Knowledge Transfer Network is a welcome development occurring as a recommendation of the 2011 Silverman Review. However, while the SIG may facilitate R&amp;D discussion, it may not in itself provide adequate sector wide representation of the current research landscape or provide the strong research leadership needed to develop a National forensic science research strategy and framework that draws the strands (academic, law enforcement and legal) together in a balanced way.  Similarly, ‘Live-time forensics’ supported by ACPO establishes areas of research and development desired by the police but does not necessarily address the more fundamental scientific research that is required in order that the courts can have confidence in some of the evidence being presented before them. \n              \n1.4\n              \nIt has been clearly demonstrated by the US National Academy of Science report (2009) that both fundamental and strategic scientific research is required to underpin both existing forensic science applications and drive the future application of novel scientific developments within the criminal justice arena.  Indeed the US National Institute of Justice has just issued two funding calls to support both ‘basic’ and ‘applied’ forensic science research with this purpose in mind.  There remains no consistent government source of funding for forensic science research in the UK.\n              \n1.5\n              \nPartnership agreements and strategic funding initiatives between end user organisations (police, forensic science providers, etc) and key academic centres with a proven track record in research delivery within forensic science is essential to the development of a coherent and balanced research strategy that will serve the whole of the criminal justice sector rather than sub sections of that sector.   Such partnerships must be based on shared values, trust and an understanding that in general the work conducted is for the generation of knowledge to support the common good of society and not only for commercial advantage.  \n&#xa0;\n              \n2.1\n              \nNo Comment\n&#xa0;\n              \n3.1\n              \n(i)\n              \nMarket contraction as more police forces bring forensic services in-\nhouse may put pressure on the current forensic science providers to maintain commercial viability. All forensic science providers working within the police procurement framework have accreditation, however no such requirement is in place as yet for in-house police laboratories although the forensic science regulator clearly favours this approach.  This potentially introduces risk into the quality of forensic science being used, and introduced, into the courts.\n3.2\n              \n(ii) \n              \nThe FSS investment in R&amp;D, in recent years at least, was used primarily to support product development and innovation in order to provide commercial advantage. As such, its closure has not resulted in a large loss of funding (as a partnership resource) available to the higher education sector where fundamental research is more likely to occur. RCUK funding for academic based research in forensic science has not been provided in any significant way since the EPSRC Think Crime program. Currently there appears to be no real appetite to alter this until research in forensic science is valued and prioritised to a greater extent by government and given strategic focus by the research councils.  Such strategic focus has begun to occur in the United States, Australia and some European countries while in the UK, forensic science R&amp;D is in serious danger of falling behind other countries, eroding its reputation, competitiveness and capability in the field.\n&#xa0;\n              \n4.1\n              \nThe Forensic Science Regulator maintains a key role in the promotion and establishment of quality standards in forensic science in England and Wales.  As forensic science provision moves increasingly in-house within police forces, the maintenance of clear unambiguous quality standards as well as staff competence is essential in providing confidence in the criminal justice system.  The Forensic Science Regulator may also at some point in the future require statutory powers within his role particularly when there is the potential for the UK government to opt out of the EC pre-Lisbon police and criminal justice measures.\n&#xa0;              \n5.1\n              \nNo Comment\n&#xa0;\n              \n6.1\n              \nNo Comment\n&#xa0;\n              \n7.1\n              \nThe closure of the FSS has meant the loss of many trained and experienced practitioners from the industry.  Some have gone overseas or left the profession completely while others have been redeployed within the industry or in some cases into academic posts. The FSS also had a number of dedicated teams (for example in evidence evaluation) which made significant contributions to the development of the thinking within these areas and this expertise has largely been disaggregated.\n&#xa0;\n              \n8.1\n              \nNo Comment\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
