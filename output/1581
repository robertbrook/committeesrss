[normal]The UKCCSRC is the focus for academic CCS research throughout the

[normal], with approximately 200 members.  This submission was prepared by the UKCCSRC Management Team using input from
[normal] 
[normal]members, but recognising the principles of academic freedom should

[normal]17.  [bold]ANNEX 1[bold] SUMMARY[bold]Current and recently completed CCS research projects involving UK universities and research institutes[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]A survey of ongoing 
[normal]academic CCS research is necessarily a work in progress and the information presented here should be taken as indicative only.  The Annex lists a total of 24
[normal]4
[normal] grants, of which approximately 20 are from EU funding sources, 1
[normal]1
[normal] from other international fundin
[normal]g
[normal], 
[normal]4
[normal]4
[normal] from industry
[normal]/government
[normal] sources
[normal] and 13 from the UKCCSRC
[normal].  
[normal]Entries for 156
[normal] grants from Research Councils UK ending in 2009 or later are also included; consistent data is
[normal] available for these so further 
[normal]analysis is possible.  The total investment in th
[normal]ese RCUK projects is over £95M.  Approximately 84% of this total (as shown in Figure 1) is from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and a further 8% each from the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and the Economic and S
[normal]ocial Research Council (ESRC).  Reflecting the respective scientific remits of these funding Councils, the majority of funding (42%) is estimated to have gone towards projects that are relevant to CO
[normal]2
[normal] Capture (see Figure 2 and 3).  The next largest  area ,
[normal] Capacity (34%), includes funding such as doctoral training centres or research centres where a core objective is in training, networking or building capacity within the academic community (but often also with some research).  Cross-Cutting Issues (13%) in
[normal]cludes CO
[normal]2
[normal] transport, whole systems analysis, CO
[normal]2
[normal] properties/chemistry, economics, environmental aspects, public perception and policy.  CO
[normal]2
[normal] Storage research for CCS is estimated to have received the least amount of funding (11%) out of these categories.  
[normal]It should be noted that core funding for NERC Research Institutes such as the British Geological Survey are not included here.
