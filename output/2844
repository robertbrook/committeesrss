defaultWritten evidence from the defaultOffice of Rail Regulation (ORR) default(WRT 023)default&#xa0;defaultSummary default&#xa0;default1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe
default welcome the opportunity to provide written evidence to the Transport Select Committee inquiry into winter resilience in transport.
default 
defaultOur response specifically looks at resilience on Britain’s mainline rail network, but will also make reference to undergroun
defaultd
default, light railway
default and tram systems.
default 
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) is the combined economic regulator for Britain’s mainline railways and the health and safety regulator for all Britain’s railways. As an independent regulator, we play a pivotal role
default in ensuring the industry delivers a safe, effective and efficient system for Government and other funders, tax payers and customers - both passengers and freight.
default 
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSpecifically, we regulate and 
defaultmonitor the performance of Network Rail, as stewards of the
default mainline network. We set and monitor targets that determine obligations and funding for a five year control period - for example, performance targets which measure the percentage of trains arriving on time and the 
defaultnumber
default of services which are 
defaultcancelled an
defaultd significantly late (CaSL).
default 
defaultAll of these are important when considering the resilience of the network to adverse weather and the impact this causes to rail customers. Following previous
default concerns
default, in 2012, we improved the provision of information for passengers by introducing a new licence condition to require operators to provide accurate and timely information to help 
defaultpassengers
default better plan their journeys –
default 
defaultespecially relevant during times of di
defaultsruption.
default 
defaultWe monitor performance against this and can take appropriate enforcement action if required.
default&#xa0;
default4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOur response to this particular inquiry can be summarised as follows: 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultHow resilient are the UK’s transport networks (including road, rail and air) to adverse winter weather? How well prepared are the Government, local adefaultuthorities and transport providers for adverse winter weather?default defaultWhat more should be done to ensure a coordinated response?default&#xa0;
default5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOn the mainline railway network, where rail freight traffic is up 17% since 2000-01 and passenger numbers are up 45% in the last deca
defaultde, customers expect and rely on the network to deliver for them all year round.
default 
defaultRail infrastructure is inherently vulnerable to weather – particularly adverse winter weather.
default 
defaultWithout necessary work to ensure resilience, 
defaultit is
default susceptible to failure
defaults 
defaultcausing delays and disruption. This not only is frustrating for
default passengers, but delays to freight trains
default during adverse cold weather
default affect the supply of coal to Britain’s power stations. Network Rail is working to gain more understanding
default of how
default to improve
default its ability to manage its assets and undertake required targeted maintenance, but there is still more work to be done to ensure rail performance is not adversely affected.
default 
defaultThere have been recent positive signs of improvement
default:
default the cross
default-
defaultindustry approach t
defaulto the issue and opportunity to design
default-
defaultin ‘research
default-
defaultbased’ solutions for new infrastructure is particularly welcomed.
default&#xa0;
default6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs we have seen, UK weather patterns are changing. Network Rail need
defaults
default to adapt their plans for both infrastructure and operations to meet 
defaultthe challenge posed by this on the railway – particularly taking forward learning from 
defaultprevious incidents
default.
default 
defaultTo increase resilience of rail assets to adverse weather such as extremes of temperature, rainfall and wind, adequate drainage and maintenance is req
defaultuired.
default 
default Without this maintenance the infrastructure is subject to failures.
default 
default During 2012 there was an increase in the number and severity of earthwork failures (emban
defaultkments and slopes which slip
default during bad weather), which were mostly associated with heavy 
defaultrainfall.
default 
defaultTable 1 shows the close correlation between rainfall and earthwork failures.
default&#xa0;
defaultTable 1 defaultClose correlation between high rainfall and landslips in 2010-13default&#xa0;
default7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultInfrastructure 
defaultfailures increase potential safety risks and put a heavier reliance on 
defaultproactive inspection and maintenance to identify and control those risks.
default 
defaultFor example, in 2012 ORR served an 
defaultenforcement notice in Scotland 
default which required Network Rail to carry out risk assessment on earthwork failures and implement control measures such
default as speed restrictions on parts of a route to reduce the risk of train derailment due to failed earthworks.
default 
defaultWhile reactive control measures can help manage the overall safety risk, they are only an interim measure before more proactive and sustainable resi
defaultlience and climate change solutions are 
defaultrequir
defaulted.
default 
default&#xa0;
default8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultORR’s scrutiny suggests that Network Rail should identify locations which are particularly vulnerable
default to flooding
default and
default,
default rather than replacing assets ‘like for like’, conventional ballast which is easily washed away could be replaced with concrete slabs to support the track and electrical cabinets could be raised above ground level.
default 
defaultThis opportunity to 
default“design-
defaultin
default”
default solutions
default would increase resilience and recovery times following an incident.
default 
default&#xa0;
default9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultprecursor indicator model (PIM),
default developed by
default 
defaultthe industry’s Rail Safety and Standards Board
default 
default(
defaultRSSB
default)
default, shows that following
default improvements
default between 2006-09, risk reduction levelled
default-
defaultoff 
defaultbetween 2009 and 2011; and increased 34% between December 2011 and December 2012 because of weather-caused infrastructure failure. However, we have seen improvement in overall precursor risk reduction trend more recently: it reduced 4% since the start of 2
default013-14.
default 
default&#xa0;
default10.
default 
defaultWinter and adverse weather-caused risks also pose similar infrastructure and rolling stock-related risks to Britain’s tram
default,
default 
defaultlight rail 
defaultand underground 
defaultnetworks.
default 
defaultAs these services are often urban in na
defaultture
default they are less susceptible to weather and 
defaulttemperature
default-caused
default risks, 
defaultbut 
defaultstaff not being able to get to work, or being in the wrong place to do their jobs
default,
default remains a common risk
default. However, running such services, particularly trams, is dependent on road surfaces being cleared of snow and ice.
default&#xa0;
default11.
default 
defaultIn its 
defaultStrategic Business Plan for 2014-2019
default 
defaultand 
defaultresponse to the 
defaultD
defaultraft determination,
default 
defaultNetwork Rail recognised the need to improve the resilience of the rail infrastructure systems to weather
default,
default to increase reliability and mitigate the risks associated with
default climate change. 
defaultIt is
default seeking to develop “considered evidence-based adaptation strategies” for the UK rail infrastructure focused on key questions:
default&#xa0;
defaultNetwork
default Rail also has a programme of work to 
defaultmake their assets more resilient to climate change and extreme weather
default – for example targeted work with local water management groups to improve the management of drainage and earthworks.
default&#xa0;
default12.
default 
defaultIn response to the Climate 
defaultChange Act 2008, Network Rail, in conjunction with RSSB has undertaken research to understand and mitigate against likely future climate change scenarios. They have established the Weather Resilience &amp; Climate Change Steering Group (WRCCSG) to develop and 
defaultdeliver a strategy to manage the risk of weather and climate change impact
defaults
default on rail performance, in order to achieve the vision of a ‘weather-ready railway’. 
default&#xa0;
default13.
default 
defaultThis cross-industry approach is welcomed and ORR would like to see more widespread co-operation 
defaultand collaboration between Network Rail and other railway operators to ensure targeted investment is made to make assets more resilient to severe weather. To encourage this, we are actively working with industry 
defaultthrough groups including
default the 
defaultSustainable Deve
defaultlopment Steering Group (SDSG), 
defaultRail Delivery Group (RDG) and National Task Force (NTF).
default&#xa0;
default14.
default 
defaultWith
default continued investment by Government in the rail industry, there is the opportunity to “design-in” improved resilience to deal with current and future weather extremes.
default 
defaultThe industry has taken advantage of a range of evidence from European partner railways w
defaulthere infrastructure has been exposed to extreme heat, cold
default,
default wind and water.
default 
defaultThis has allowed the development of a detailed environmental specification for the European Rail Traffic Management System Programme. It has also enabled climate resilience to be a
defaultddressed in 
defaultthe specification for the forthcoming electrification of the western route.
default&#xa0;default15.
default 
defaultWe have stepped up our monitoring of Network Rail to ensure that it takes a more proactive approach to weather resilience and the adverse effect this has on 
defaultperformance and the delays and disruption incurred by passengers and freight customers.
default 
defaultOur Final Determination for 2014-2019 propose
defaults
default a number of national level targets. These were set out in our 
defaultDraft Determination
default and include monitoring Network Rail’s 
defaultoverall capability and speed of progress in managing its assets, the quality of the asset data it collects, the success of internal asset management programmes and the condition, performance and failure of each asset type.
default 
default&#xa0;
default16.
default 
defaultThere is further evidence that 
defaultthe industry and Network Rail in particular are responding to the issues posed by severe weather.
default 
defaultNetwork Rail has developed 
defaulta route-level 
defaultplan
default for the western route, and we expect Network Rail to publish 
defaultroute-level
default resilience and recovery plans by Septem
defaultber 2014 for all routes.
default 
defaultRecovery plans are essential, but rely on staff being able to travel to work in order to implement them.
default 
defaultSome operators put up key staff in local hotels to reduce
default such
default risk
default 
defaulthowever improved resilience across the whole transport sys
defaulttem would help to mitigate this further.
default 
defaultWe will monitor closely the industry’s progress against delivering these, but we are aware that only real-life events can stress-test the plans.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat lessons have been learned since the severe weather experienced defaultin the winter of 2009-10?default defaultWhat practical changes have been made to ensure the UK is now better equipped to deal with severe weather?default&#xa0;
default17.
default 
defaultWhile rail customers suffered less disruption than road travellers during the winter of 2010-11, significant lessons have 
defaultbeen learnt right across the rail
defaultway
default industry.
default 
defaultDuring this period – in particular during the heavy snow
default – 
defaultthe rail industry adopted a pragmatic “get people home” approach, operating emergency timetables rather than trying to meet regulatory performance tar
defaultgets.
default 
defaultThere has been considerable work across the rail industry to define practical measures that could be implemented both by Network Rail as the infrastructure operator and the train operating companies (TOCs) to improve railway future resilience.
default&#xa0;
default18.
default 
defaultThe s
defaultnow in winter 2010-11 was particularly severe in Scotland.
default defaultSome delays were caused by frozen points and snowdrifts, but one of the most significant problems was a build-up of compacted ice on the underside of trains. This could take six hours to defrost be
defaultfore basic safety checks and engineering work
default could take place. More than seventy
default 
defaulttrains needed to be withdrawn from service after carriages were damaged by ice in Scotland alone.
default&#xa0;
default19.
default 
defaultFollowing the events of 2010, First ScotRail
default visited Helsinki, Finland, where heated power showers are routinely used to remove compacted snow and ice from carriages during the winter. In 2011, they trialed this approach using heated showers in poly
default-
defaulttunnels to enable trains to be defrosted more quic
defaultkly. 
defaultFollowing the success of this, they have been incorporated into ScotRail
default’s
default depots on a permanent basis and a three-carriage diesel train can now be defrosted in less than two hours.
default&#xa0;
default20.
default 
defaultRail services in south London
default,
default which use a third-rail power supply s
defaultystem, were also affected during the severe snow of 2010-11.
default 
defaultSince 2010 an extensive winter resilience progr
defaultamme has been adopted, including
default the design and installation of conductor rail
default 
defaultheating and the development of dedicated anti-snow and ice-treatment 
defaulttrains.
default 
defaultSome of Southeastern’s class 375 trains have also been f
defaultitted with de-icing fluid tanks,
default which can apply 
defaultde-icing
default fluid to the rails
default when required in service.
default&#xa0;
default21.
default 
defaultThe industry has not just focused on mitigating the effects of the snow seen in 2010 but
default has also looked at how to better deal with the disruption to train services from other extreme weather.
default 
defaultFollowing the flooding in November and December 2012 in south west England and Wales, Network Rail carried out a review of infrastructure resilience an
defaultd the root
default-
defaultcauses of failure and disruption on the western route. From this work, 
defaultthirty seven 
defaultsites were identified as contributing to 96% of the delays and specifically nine locations were identified for targeted work to improve resilience.
default 
defaultThis work is 
defaultscheduled to take place between 2013 and 2016.
default 
default&#xa0;
default22.
default 
defaultNetwork Rail has recently retendered its contract for the maintenance and supply
default 
defaultof its specialised
default 
defaultautumn and winter fleet of rail vehicles designed to keep the railway open during severe weather. Network 
defaultRail has carried out site visits to each depot to assess the current maintenance facilities to establish their suitability for the operation of autumn and winter services. Each depot now has a full summary of works.
default 
defaultORR’s safety inspectors have also inspec
defaultted train operators management systems to better manage train wheels slipping on rails following leaf-fall in the autumn and when dew forms on the railhead. 
default&#xa0;
default23.
default 
defaultThe provision of information to passengers during adverse weather has significantly improved sinc
defaulte winter 2010.
default 
defaultFrom March 2012
default ORR introduced a new operator licence condition to set out responsibilities and ensure that passengers had access to up to date reliable information to help plan and make their journeys - particularly during severe disruption
default.
default 
defaultIn our associated 
defaultregulatory statement
default we set out how we expected the industry to comply with the
default code of practice on the provision of information to passengers during disruption.
default 
defaultThis sets the following requirements
default:
default&#xa0;
default24.
default 
defaultThe industry has responded positively.
default 
defaultAs detailed in our
default De
defaultcember 2012 report into passenger information,
default 
defaultmany station staff now have smart phones with access to real-time data, while ticket office staff have better access to up to date information.
default 
defaultWhile this still requires stress-testing in a live situation, th
defaulte level and quality of information for passengers at stations, online and through social media has and continues to improve across the industry.
default 
default 
defaultThe indus
defaulttry 
defaultupdate their plans annually 
defaultand 
defaultto take into account developments in technology, changes to 
defaultpassenger needs and lessons learnt in the light of experience. ORR
default 
defaultengages with industry and 
defaultmonitors
default 
defaultperformance to ensure that all parties fulfil their obligations and in 2014 we intend to review the current code to identify whether further improvements 
defaultare required.
default 
defaultIn addition, the £100
defaultm
default fund for station improvements in 2014-19 could be used to improve passenger information systems, however this would need to be considered against competing us
defaultes
default for the fund and decided under the governance procedures.
default&#xa0;
default25.
default 
defaultDuring times of severe weather, passengers often have to make sophisticated travel decisions, taking into consideration the full range of travel modes available to the
defaultm –
default 
defaultfor example, rail, road, bus, car or
default 
defaultworking
default from home. While the availability and quality of rail information has improved, the passenger experience
default, it
default could be 
defaultfurther 
defaultimproved by 
defaultproviding 
defaulteasier access to local and regional cross-modal transport information. This would enable customers to compr
defaultehensively plan their journey with
default the
default confidence that they have information about all of the travel options open to them. The 
defaultDepartment for Transport
default has set out its view on the value of cross-modal information in the
defaultir
default recent 
defaultstrategy; 
default“
defaultDoor to Door – a
default strategy for improving sustainable transport.”
default 
defaultWe believe that access to cross-modal transport information is particularly important in times of service disruption and are actively encouraging the industry to continue to make data available to third-part
defaulty data developers who could develop software applications to provide this functionality
default to the travelling public
default.
default 
default 
default&#xa0;
default26.
default 
defaultORR places significant 
defaultweight
default on ensuring that the mainline railway delivers for all of its customers and funders; and hopefully the information provided will be useful in informing your inquiry.

defaultsistance to the inquiry, please do not hesitate to contact me
