"&#xa0;\nUK\n FOOD SECURITY\nA Written Paper submitted by William \nSlinger\n, B.Sc. (\nHons\n) Ag.\n&#xa0;\nI submit this evidence as an individual farmer. I am also the Chairman and founding Director of Connect Plus Ltd a company formed by farmers to develop and market a local milk brand, \nBowland\n Fresh Milk.\nI was co-author of the report “Are UK Farmers in a Common Market?” in 2000, following which in association with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Centre for Political and Diplomatic Studies, I helped to host a group of senior agricultural officials/agriculture ministers from the, then, European Union (EU) Candidate Countries of Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean and established first person relations with all the senior agricultural officials/agriculture ministers from those States, comprising Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, The Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Malta, &amp; Cyprus.\nSubsequently I was consulted by the Curry Commission in respect of their Report and I was invited to, and attended, a conference held in the presence of His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales to review the state of the agricultural sector in respect of supplier’s relationships with the major retailers at \nKendal\n, \nCumbria\n, 2005\nI was invited by His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales to attend and contribute to a review of the state of the agricultural sector, in the presence of His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales, along with the Secretary of State for the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, \nRt\n Hon David \nMilliband\n, and invited others at Keswick, Cumbria, 2007.\nI led a Dairy Value Chain Analysis project team in conjunction with the Food Chain Centre and \nCardiff\n \nBusiness\n \nSchool\n analysing the dairy sector supply chain from farm to end customer which resulted in the production and national publication of “\nBowland\n Fresh – Developing Uniquely Differentiated Products\n \n–A Case Study”\nI was invited by His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales to attend and contribute to a review of the state of the agricultural sector, in the presence of His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales, along with the Secretary of State for the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, \nRt\n Hon Hilary Benn, MP, Sir Donald Curry and invited others at Kendal, Cumbria, 2008\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nINTRODUCTION\n&#xa0;\nThis paper is structured with the principle points outlined in the executive summary followed by a more general rationale. The two main areas considered are food security issues and recommendations as to how food security might be strengthened in the \nUK\n.\n&#xa0;\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nRATIONALE\n&#xa0;\nThe best thing that could be done for food security in the \nUK\n would be for us to ensure that a fair proportion of the money which the consumer pays for food finds its way back to the producer of that food. If we could achieve that then we might be able to dispense with much if not all the expense and paraphernalia of agricultural support payments and put the public’s money to a more useful purpose, or refrain from taking it off them in the first place.\nAgriculture is an issue of critical concern to any nation and one of the primary responsibilities of any government is to ensure the maintenance of a sound and farsighted agricultural policy, of which an adequate supply of safe and affordable food is a major benefit. \nFarmers have been burdened with regulation and we have demanded the best standards in welfare and production. In itself this is a laudable aspiration. We undermine our efforts by failing to ensure that the other producers we allow also to supply the markets which our farmers are expected to compete in adhere to the same high standards that farmers in the \nUnited Kingdom\n are rightly expected to adhere to.\nThe \nUK\n’s agricultural industry must be allowed the freedom to operate in what is a broadly free market economy. However it must be allowed to do so without frequently finding itself rendered economically unviable through no inherent fault of its own, in particular where government can prevent it. In particular one which uses resources to provide their optimum outputs, not necessarily their maximum outputs.\nHistory has shown us that there will be times when farmers are able to derive an adequate return for their produce from the market and times when they are not. Their income can decline to such a degree that it becomes insufficient to sustain their businesses and themselves and their families. We must \nensure, if we are to expect the calibre of farmers to whom future generations are entitled, that our farmers can expect to receive a fair return for their efforts. The link between effort and reward is and must remain at the centre of all moral societies. It cannot be in anyone’s long term interests that the farmer does not receive a fair return.\nIf the farmer is able to secure a fair return for produce in the marketplace we ought to be able to save the public a great deal of money in misdirected agricultural support schemes. Losses in transmission of such support are notorious and unnecessary. To this end any intervention via subsidy payments, such as may be found necessary, ought to be paid on a uniform basis per unit of output to do otherwise is to distort the market in a manner which will be unhelpful in the longer term. \n&#xa0;\nIt seems that the public are prepared to pay some form of support to those farmers who, through their efforts in maintaining and enhancing some of our more scenic areas and those with an amenity value, contribute to the nation’s well-being in respects other than those entirely “market-orientated”. Such support however must be entirely decoupled from production and the level of that support will necessarily be set at a level which the public are content to pay for.\nThere is no reason why for those products in which we enjoy a comparative advantage this country cannot supply as much of its own needs as it can from our own resources. \nGovernment “help” for the processing and marketing of agricultural products is of limited value. The demand for agricultural produce generally remains the same or increases only slowly over time. Agricultural marketing therefore tends to be in effect a move to increase a share of a particular market, rather than in attempting to increase that market. It is especially difficult as agricultural produce on the whole has an inelastic demand. Where government has effectively acted to prevent farmers working together in a viable manner, such as with the case of Milk Marque and the DTI inquiry, farmers have found themselves in an impossible situation.\n&#xa0;\nAlso the form of help offered by government is generally financial when really ideas are what are required and if a diversification scheme is really as viable as it is supposed to be, one has to wonder whether someone wouldn’t have thought of it and be doing that already.\n&#xa0;\nOpinions about farming expressed by our leaders and members of the public today are determined by what was happening yesterday and whatever impression they may be under about what might be happening today. What actually is happening today or what we can expect to be happening tomorrow does not shape it. It will be responsible policy to correct this problem, to facilitate a better decision making process with respect to food and its security of supply.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
