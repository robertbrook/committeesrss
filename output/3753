defaultWritten evidence submitted by defaultKenneth MacLean [FBB0019]default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThis submission is comprised of my replies to and observations relating to
default 
defaultquestions set forth in the Committeeʼs press release of 22 October 2013.
default&#xa0;
defaultI write as a person who
default has listened to BBC radio since the 1940s and viewed
default 
defaultBBC television since the 1950s.
default&#xa0;
defaultAt the end of this document is a statistics section which presents statistics
default 
defaultillustrative of the size of the BBC in the UK media world.
default&#xa0;defaultWhat should the BBC be for and defaultwhat should be the purpose of publicdefault defaultservice broadcasting?default&#xa0;
defaultPerhaps the easiest way to approach the first limb of this question is to ask
default 
defaultʻ
defaultWhat should the BBC 
defaultnot
default be for?ʼ.
default&#xa0;
defaultMy 
defaulthigh level 
defaultanswer to this reversed question is both simple and emphatic:
default 
defaultthe BB
defaultC should not exist to provide the type and quality of radio, TV and
default 
defaultonline content that is, or could be, provided by commercial media
default 
defaultorganisations.
default&#xa0;
defaultIf the BBC does little or nothing of significance over and above mimicking
default 
defaultprivate sector media organisati
defaultons, then it has no reason to exist at all.
default&#xa0;
defaultAnd for the avoidance of doubt, the veracity of this observation is in no way
default 
defaultlessened because the BBC happens to be a giant news and current affairs
default 
defaultorganisation. Clearly, a raison dʼêtre
default for the BBC cannot reside in its size
default 
defaultalone.
default&#xa0;
defaultA further question thus arises, namely ʻDoes the BBC do anything of
default 
defaultsignificance that could not readily be done by other media organisations?ʼ.
default&#xa0;
defaultI address this further question in my answer below to the Commit
defaultteeʼs
default 
defaultquestion concerning the scope, scale and remit of the BBC.
defaultHow well has the BBC performed in the current Charter period indefault defaultachieving its mission and public purposes?default&#xa0;
defaultBeing but an ordinary viewer and listener, I was not familiar with the concept of
default 
defaultthe BBCʼs mission but the BBC website soon informed me that the BBC has a
default 
defaultMission ʻto enrich peopleʼs lives with programmes and services that inform,
default 
defaulteducate and entertainʼ.
default&#xa0;
defaultI am obliged to the BBC in seeking to enrich me because my annual TV tax
default 
defaulttogether
default with that of a multitude of others certainly enriches many senior
default 
defaultmanagers and celebrities at the BBC.
default&#xa0;
defaultGoogling the term ʻpublic purposesʼ immediately located it for me as being in
default 
defaultthe BBC Charter. I was thus able to observe that the first Public Purpose
default of the
default 
defaultBBC is ʻsustaining citizenship and civil societyʼ. I was left wondering if the
default 
defaultcitizen is to exclaim “Gosh, what a wondrous thing is the BBC” or whether he
default 
defaultis to think to himself “Crikey, a bit Orwellian that!”.
default&#xa0;
defaultMy seeking enlightenment in this 
defaultvein also yielded an insight into the ways in
default 
defaultwhich the BBC Trust attempts to impart to the management the strategy that
default 
defaultthe Trust has formulated and the tools that have been constructed for
default 
defaultattempting to monitor the performance of the management. In this 
defaultcontext I
default 
defaultobserved that there exist 
defaultinter alia 
defaultStrategic Objectives whereby, for example,
default 
defaultthe Trust ʻchallengesʼ the BBC to increase the distinctiveness and quality of
default 
defaultoutput, Service Licences, Protocols, Public Purposes and Purpose Remits,
default 
defaultAnnual Tracking
default Surveys, Statements of Programme Policy and Summary
default 
defaultWorkplans.
default&#xa0;
defaultI conclude that the objectives given to the BBC by the Charter (plus
default 
defaultFramework Agreement) are largely of a high-flown flannel nature and that the
default 
defaultmachinery for setting the direction of the BB
defaultC and for assessing performance
default 
defaultis so hideously bureaucratic and so formulaic when put into practice that
default 
defaultmeaningful results are hardly to be expected.
default&#xa0;
defaultFor these reasons I am unable to provide a direct answer to the subject
default 
defaultquestion. I would, however, lik
defaulte to attempt to provide some relevant
default 
defaultobservations to the Committee, and these now follow.
default&#xa0;
defaultI suggest that it is very useful in examining the BBCʼs performance to adopt a
default 
defaultlong timescale and to concentrate on television services.
default&#xa0;
defaultUp until the mid-1950s the
default BBC had a monopoly in TV and I distinctly remember, although I was a teenager, my apprehension when it was announced that commercial TV was to be introduced. I was worried that commercial TV would affect deleteriously the standards of BBC TV. 
default&#xa0;
defaultI cannot p
defaultretend to remember the exact chronology, but the upshot over a
default 
defaultcertain timescale was as feared. The BBC did not stand firm on quality
default 
defaultstandards, but gave in to the temptation of attempting to maintain ratings as
default 
defaultagainst what it perceived to be rival servic
defaultes.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe psychology of the BBCʼs reaction to the inception of commercial TV could
default 
defaultnot be more simple. The BBC bigwigs apprehended that the punters who paid
default 
defaultthe bigwigsʼ salaries and underpinned the bigwigsʼ careers would begin to
default 
defaultcomplain if they had to 
defaultpay compulsorily a licence fee for programmes the
default 
defaultviewership figures of which fell below those of the commercial services.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe adoption of the ratings chasing policy was thus driven by a desire for self
default-
defaultpreservation.
default 
defaultIn the demotic the policy goes, of cou
defaultrse, by the name of ʻratings
default 
defaultwarʼ. The BBC became adept at fighting the ratings war and it has maintained
default 
defaultto the present day its view that being active in that war is vital to the BBCʼs
default 
defaultcontinued existence.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis plain and simple fact about the BBC is publ
defaulticly admitted by very few of
default 
defaultour parliamentarians. Indeed, the flow over the years of MPs and peers who
default 
defaultget upon their feet to proclaim that the BBC provides the ʻgold standardʼ of
default 
defaultbroadcasting quality has never ceased.
default&#xa0;
defaultIs it a prerequisite of being a pol
defaultitician that one can selectively fail to see
default 
defaultelephants in the room? Whatever the answer to that question, the fact is that
default 
defaultwhilst operating ostensibly under strict requirements as to the maintenance of
default 
defaulthigh standards, the BBC has in fact been permitted for
default sixty years, and by all
default 
defaultparties, to consistently produce a general output at that low level which is
default 
defaultdictated by ratings considerations.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis means that scandalously the public have been, and still are being,
default 
defaultcharged, on a compulsory basis, for a sub-sta
defaultndard product.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat scope, scale and remit should the BBC have?default&#xa0;
defaultAs I intimated in my answer to the first question, the BBC should be
default 
defaultgiven scope, scale and remit only if it can provide output which is significantly
default 
defaultdifferent from that which is deliverable by other organisations, including
default 
defaultcommercial companies. A requirement additional to difference is, of course,
default 
defaultpublic value.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs I explained with reference to the second question, albeit that the BBC operates under a
default cloak of ultra-respectable Public Purposes etc., it has in fact over a very long period chosen to maintain a dumbed down output as its continuous response to the output of what it sees as its rivals.
default&#xa0;
defaultHere then we have a problematic situation. In choosing
default to dumb down its
default 
defaultoutput to bolster its programme ratings the BBC has 
defaultipso facto 
defaultbrought itself
default 
defaultdown to the level of its rivals. And in doing this, it has extinguished any
default 
defaultjustification for claiming to be significantly different from its rivals.
default&#xa0;
defaultAt this j
defaultuncture perhaps I hear members of the Committee saying “But what
default 
defaultabout the BBCʼs output of news and current affairs?”. “Surely everyone
default 
defaultacknowledges the BBCʼs pre-eminence in that sphere”.
default&#xa0;
defaultWell, let us consider a comparison of the quality of a commercial 
defaultTV news
default 
defaultservice, Sky News, and a prominent BBC TV news service, BBC News 24.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt cannot be seriously said that one of these services is significantly
default 
defaultsuperior or significantly inferior to the other. Individuals may, of course, favour
default 
defaultone over the other bec
defaultause of personal preference or merely through
default 
defaulthabit.
default&#xa0;
defaultHere it is pertinent to note from the statistical section (pp. 14 &amp; 15) that
default 
defaultwhen it comes to users of the most used TV news sources, most rate
default 
defaultthem reasonably highly in respect of accuracy, trustworthi
defaultness and impartiality.
default 
defaultAnd, as the table on page 15 shows, the news services of ITV and Sky are
default 
defaultrated very much on a par with those of the BBC.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe broadcast media have from their inception been seen as potent in their
default 
defaultpotential for upholding the democrat
defaultic values of this country but representing
default 
defaultequally potently a threat to democracy should they to come under undesirable
default 
defaultcontrol. At the nub of these considerations is the broadcasting of news.
default&#xa0;
defaultPoliticians, in providing for an appropriate framework for the
default operation of the
default 
defaultbroadcast media, have thus put special effort into attempting to ensure that all
default 
defaultradio and TV organisations which broadcast news items do so in a fair,
default 
defaultaccurate, impartial etc. manner. Indeed, it may be said that the provision of
default 
defaultnews acc
defaultording to these criteria lies at the very heart of the concept of public
default 
defaultservice broadcasting, whether one has in mind the BBC or the public service
default 
defaultobligations of the other broadcasters.
default&#xa0;
defaultThus if it is the case that the public see BBC news provision as on
default a level with
default 
defaultthe news provision of other providers, that is, if it does not see the BBCʼs news
default 
defaultprovision as being distinctly more accurate, trustworthy and impartial, then the
default 
defaultBBC has failed the 
defaultAcid Test of Differentiation
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultIf there was any question of 
defaultthe TV news output of non-BBC organisations
default 
defaultbeing significantly inferior to that of the BBC as judged on the crucial criteria
default 
defaultaforementioned, this would be a matter of loud, prolonged and general debate,
default 
defaultnot least,
default 
defaultof course, on prog
defaultr
defaultammes such as 
defaultQuestion
default Time. 
defaultNo such debate
default 
defaultexists.
default&#xa0;
defaultNow as I have already pointed out, in choosing to engage in the ratings war
default 
defaultthe BBC has had to generally dumb down its output to the level of its rivals. As
default 
defaultto whether this general dumbing down includes the BBCʼs news and rel
defaultated
default 
defaultprogrammes can be left for debate, because as has been established the BBC
default 
defaultfails the news-specific 
defaultAcid Test of Differentiation.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe logic thus is that the BBC does not warrant scope, scale or remit because
default 
defaultits continued existence cannot be justified
default on PSB grounds.
default&#xa0;
defaultThat is not to say that the continued existence of the BBC at a drastically
default 
defaultreduced scale (size) might not be justified. On this basis I will now make some
default 
defaultremarks on the present size and scope of activities of the BBC and as to what
default 
defaultmight be an appropriate size/scope in the future.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn my consideration of the size/scope of the present BBC I have in mind the
default 
defaultBBC as a provider of radio, TV and online services.
default&#xa0;
defaultMy contention is that the BBC is far too big. In my view the BBC has been
default 
defaultpe
defaultrmitted to grow to such an extent that it now constitutes a danger to vital
default 
defaultelements of the UK media industry including commercial radio and TV,
default 
defaultnational and local, and to local and national newspapers. The BBC is a grave
default 
defaultimpediment to the establishment of
default a healthily diverse media scene in the UK.
default&#xa0;
defaultI will not dwell on the deleterious effects that BBC TV and radio are having on
default 
defaultthe general media because I am certain that others far more authoritative than
default 
defaultI will make submissions to the Committee. All that I
default will do is to underline the
default 
defaultfact that it is only in a healthily diverse media scene that the public are
default 
defaultexposed to a range of different opinions, views and information from a variety
default 
defaultof sources.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe dominance of the BBC over the three major platforms (TV
default, radio and online) is
default 
defaultamply testified to by facts presented in the statistics section, but it might be helpful
default 
defaulthere to highlight some specific facts about the BBCʼs news dominance which are
default 
defaultrevealed in the said section.
default&#xa0;
defaultAccording to one survey, 78% of those who follow the news use TV therefor,
default 
defaultwith 40% using newspapers, 35% radio and 32% the internet. See 
defaultp. 11
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultAccording to another survey, using slightly different methodology, the figures
default 
defaultare: TV 85%, radio and newspape
defaultrs 53% each and internet 41%. See 
defaultp. 12
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe BBCʼs cross-platform audience reach for news at the retail level is 86%,
default 
defaultthe second and third places being taken by ITV (40%) and Sky (28%). See 
defaultp.
default 
default13
default.
default&#xa0;
default[Clearly all three platforms, but especially TV, are impo
defaultrtant for news and thus
default 
defaultdominance over three platforms, including TV, must be very concerning.]
default&#xa0;
default75% of all TV news viewers use BBC One as a news source, the second most
default 
defaultused being ITV (42%). Also, of the top six TV news services, three are BBC.
default 
defaultSee p. 
default15
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe BBCʼs share of news by channel group increased between 2002 and 2011
default 
defaultfrom 59% to 74%. See p. 
default14.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn respect of the BBC radio presence, the BBC UK-wide radio stations include
default 
defaultthe top three radio stations (Radio 4, Radio 2 and Radio 1) used for news.
default 
defaultMoreover, out of the top fifteen stations, nine are BBC and in aggregate BBC
default 
defaultUK-wide radio stations account for two-thirds of those who use radio for news.
default 
defaultSee p. 
default15
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs to the BBC presence 
defaultonline
default, of the 41% of UK adults who use the internet
default 
defaultfor news, 57% use the BBC website or a BBC app, with Facebook and Google
default 
defaulttaking 19% share each. Sky takes 17%. See p. 
default15
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn December 2011 there were nine online news brands reaching over 2 m
default 
defaultpeople per month. Of these the BBC had the highest reach with 1
default1 m Second
default 
defaultand third came DMGT (6.6 m) and Yahoo (4.1 m). BSkyB came in with 1.3 m.
default 
defaultSee p. 
default15
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere can be no doubt that the BBC is a giant organisation 
defaultper se. 
defaultThis can be
default 
defaultready appreciated by merely examining the list of UK Public Services given in the
default 
defaultJune 2006 Framework Agreement. And as amply demonstrated by the statistics
default 
defaultsection, the BBC is a true monster in the news arena. It is thus not surprising that
default 
defaultaccording to a recent DCMS consultation document on media plurality, the 2011
default 
defaultnews and current 
defaultaffairs spend of the BBC was more than that of the remaining UK
default 
defaulttelevision and radio news broadcasters combined.
default&#xa0;
defaultAdded to the picture of overwhelming dominance in news provision is the startling
default 
defaultfact that the BBC possess this dominant position not only in
default broadcasting but within
default 
defaultand across the three major news platforms of radio, TV and online.
default&#xa0;
defaultFurthermore it is most important to have cognisance of the fact that owing to the
default 
defaultsynergistic interaction between the platforms of the multi-platform BBC, the BBC 
defaulthas
default 
defaulta power more than congruent with the sum of its parts.
default&#xa0;
defaultAll this very disturbing because what it means is that not only does the BBC fail to be
default 
defaultdifferentiated from other media organisations when it comes to TV broadcasting,
default 
defaultnews or general, but in the 
defaultnews function it is a giant which holds an overwhelmingly
default 
defaultdominant position across radio, TV and online.
default&#xa0;
defaultThus all that does differentiate the BBC are the features of 1. giant size, 2. 
defaultT
defaulthe
default 
defaultabsence of advertisements (at least commercial ones) and 3. the imp
defaultosition of the
default 
defaultTV tax.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the present context, as well as embracing the concept of size, the word ʼscopeʼ
default 
defaultconnotes ʻrange of activitiesʼ and this raises a very serious and concerning aspect of
default 
defaultthe BBC in its present form.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the BBC Charter one of the BB
defaultCʼs Public Purposes is ʻhelping to deliver to the
default 
defaultpublic the benefit of emerging communications technologiesʼ. In non-spin language
default 
defaultwhat this means is that the BBC is licensed to spend TV tax payersʼ money to
default 
defaultextend its activities from radio and TV to onli
defaultne. This is reflected in the 2006
default 
defaultFramework Agreement as ʻa comprehensive online content service, with content
default 
defaultserving the whole range of the BBCʼs Public Purposesʼ, meaning that the extension
default 
defaultto online is to be a wholesale one.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs above shown the BBC has
default taken full advantage of this carte blanche and it has
default 
defaultspent highly - at an annual rate of £177m (2012/13 BBC Financial Statements) 
default–
default in
default 
defaultestablishing its commanding presence for news online, although as noted in the
default 
defaultstatistics section (pp. 15 &amp; 16) users o
defaultf news websites rated Sky as fully equivalent
default 
defaultto the BBC for accuracy &amp; reliability, trustworthiness and impartiality &amp; lack of bias.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat then is so very serious and concerning about the BBCʼs so establishing itself in
default 
defaultthe new communications medium of on
defaultline? An indication was given very recently by
default 
defaultthe Home Secretary in a speech she gave to a gathering of the Society of Editors. In
default 
defaulther speech Mrs May made the following observations.
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultLocal newspapers are having a particularly hard time. That has been pa
defaultrtly the
default 
defaultresult of the BBCʼs dominant position on the internet, and its ability to subsidise the
default 
defaultprovision of internet news using the licence fee. This makes it enormously difficult for
default 
defaultlocal newspapers to compete. If the BBC can, as they do, provide all t
defaulthe locally
default 
defaultsignificant news, what is left to motivate the local reader to buy a paper?
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is destroying local newspapers and it could eventually happen to national
default 
defaultnewspapers as well.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis is dangerous for local politics as it is for local journalism.”
default&#xa0;
default“This is a debate that wonʼt go away and I believe that the BBC has to think carefully
default 
defaultabout its presence locally and the impact that has on local democracy.”
default&#xa0;
defaultNo doubt Mrs May, as a senior cabinet minister, was being somewhat circumspect with her comments
default on the BBCʼs online services, but she certainly identified a grave threat to the print media, both local and national. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the years running up to the commencement of the present Charter it may have
default 
defaultappeared simply logical to permit the TV tax funded BBC
default to extent itself onto the
default 
defaultnew online platform. But with the advantage of hindsight we can see that what the
default 
defaultpoliticians did in giving the thumbs-up was rather like that done, with equal facility, by
default 
defaultthe Sorcererʼs Apprentice.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhereas news services of the
default broadcast media are regulated as to impartiality, the
default 
defaultnewspapers are left to grind whatever political or other axe their proprietors fancy.
default 
defaultThus from a political point of view we have on the left the Daily Mirror, the Financial
default 
defaultTimes, the Guardian and the
default Independent, on the right the Daily Express, the Daily
default 
defaultMail and the Telegraph and with a flexible approach (over time) to position on the
default 
defaultpolitical spectrum the Sun and the Times.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe freedom of the press to choose attitudes to news items and issues 
defaultprovides the
default 
defaultpublic with an opportunity to be made aware of a wide range of arguments and
default 
defaultopinions and is 
defaultat the very heart of our democracy in the UK
default.
defaultTherefore any news media entity which poses an existential threat to the newspaper
default 
defaultindustry, whether in 
defaultrespect of printed newspapers or online services, must be
default 
defaultexamined by Parliament with the upmost seriousness and 
defaulturgency, this being all the
default 
defaultmore the case when the entity in question is a public sector entity and thus one
default 
defaultwhich is within the direct sphere 
defaultof influence of Parliament.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn looking to the future, I am not at all sure what would be an appropriate remit for
default 
defaultthe BBC. As I have indicated above, in the present era there would appear to no
default 
defaultmore justification for a nationalised broadcaster and online 
defaultoperator than there is for
default 
defaulta public sector newspaper.
default&#xa0;
defaultI do not, of course, expect to see the BBC disappear suddenly, but it is important to
default 
defaultthe future of democracy in our country that as soon as possible it is drastically
default 
defaultdecreased both in scope and scale
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn its present form the BBC is stifling media diversity and threatening the continued
default 
defaultexistence of our newspapers. This means that the BBC constitutes a threat to our
default 
defaultdemocracy.
default&#xa0;
defaultA much reduced BBC, or a successor organisation, could have one of a numbe
defaultr of
default 
defaultprofiles, but as an indicator I would suggest that the following would be appropriate.
default&#xa0;
defaultTV default defaultOne general channel approximating to an amalgam of present BBC One and
default 
defaultBBC Four, plus BBC Parliament Channel. No regional/local TV services.
default&#xa0;
defaultRadio default defaultTwo
default national channels, approximating respectively to present channels 4 and
default 
default3. No local stations.
default&#xa0;
defaultOnline default defaultExcepting for content strictly connected with BBC services, such as
default 
defaultprogramme listings, BBC Online should be cut away from the BBC to form a
default 
defaultseparate en
defaulttity funded by subscription. An alternative would be a separation of BBC
default 
defaultNews, including online news, from the remainder of the BBC, again funded by
default 
defaultsubscription.
default&#xa0;
defaultMy indications of a future BBC or successor will to some appear over-drastic, but
default 
defaultsuch is th
defaulte state of the present BBC that in the interests of a healthy democracy it is
default 
defaultin dire need of brutal surgery.
default&#xa0;
defaultReturning to the question of remit, in the light of my observations all I can advise is
default 
defaultthat any new Public Purposes or the like are couched in 
defaultterms less Orwellian and
default 
defaultless high-flown than is the case in the present Charter. I would also put in a plea that
default 
defaultthe Big Brother/social engineering tenor of the PSB purposes and characteristics set
default 
defaultout by Ofcom in its PSB Annual Report 2013 (Fig. 1) is fi
defaultrmly eschewed.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat role should the BBC play in developing technology and new ways ofdefault defaultdistributing content?default&#xa0;
defaultThe development of technology relating to TV, radio or online and novel modes of
default 
defaultdistributing content/information/data is the province of the 
defaultlikes of Google, Apple and
default 
defaultSamsung, and not that of a UK public sector broadcasting organisation.
default&#xa0;
defaultHow should the BBC be funded beyond 2016?default&#xa0;
defaultThe TV tax is very unpopular, especially in view of the multitude of sources of
default 
defaultinformation and entertainment now 
defaultavailable to the public on TV (and elsewhere).
default&#xa0;
defaultIn my view the idea of imposing a compulsory tax on the UK public in respect of one
default 
defaultout of a multitude of media outlets is a totally unjustified anachronism. Much would
default 
defaultbe the rejoicing among the populace upo
defaultn the lifting of this unfair imposition.
default&#xa0;
defaultLooking at the matter from a different angle, if the BBCʼs current output truly
default 
defaultrepresents the gold standard of quality in broadcasting as some parliamentarians
default 
defaultregularly claim, why should not the BBC be funded, an
defaultd funded only, by the
default 
defaultvoluntary subscriptions of members of the public.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs set forth above, it is clear that the BBCʼs online services in respect of news are
default 
defaultthreatening the continued existence of national and local newspapers. This supplies
default 
defaultanother and v
defaultital reason as to why, if the BBC is to be permitted to continue to put
default 
defaultout news and current affairs online, the BBC should be funded on a subscription
default 
defaultbasis.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have had ample evidence of late as to the BBCʼs talent for wasting TV tax
default 
defaultpayersʼ money as we
defaultll as to other management shortcomings. Thus an advantage of
default 
defaultfunding the BBC on a subscription basis is that the BBC would, for the first time,
default 
defaulthave to earn its income. This would tighten up management.
default&#xa0;
defaultHow should the BBC be governed, regulated and held adefaultccountable?default&#xa0;
defaultIt is surely clear that the replacement of BBC governors by the BBC Trust has been
default 
defaulta true failure. One cannot be surprise at this since any objective person would
default 
defaultperceive immediately that the concept of a body a part of the BBC being 
defaultresponsible
default 
defaultfor overseeing the BBC and at the same time representing the TV tax payer was
default 
defaultdoomed to failure.
default&#xa0;
defaultThus the BBC, whether it is to exist in the near future in its giant, overbearing,
default 
defaultcompetition suppressing , democracy threatening form or not, mu
defaultst be regulated by
default 
defaulta body outside the BBC. Whether that body is Ofcom in its present or a modified
default 
defaultform is a moot point, but future regulation must be external of the BBC.
default&#xa0;
defaultUK Media Statisticsdefault&#xa0;defaultIntroductiondefault&#xa0;
defaultThis statistics section presents statistics 
defaultillustrative of the present shape of the UK
default 
defaultmedia and more especially of the extent of the BBCʼs operations and of the size of
default 
defaultits presence in the UK media world.
default&#xa0;
defaultEmphasis is placed on the provision of news services. The reason for this is simply
default 
defaultthat the
default availability of a plurality of news sources is essential to the healthy working
default 
defaultof a democracy. In this context “plurality” connotes many rather than few news
default 
defaultservices and, just as importantly, the avoidance of any one media organisation
default 
defaulthaving too much i
defaultnfluence over public opinion and over the political process.
default&#xa0;
defaultSeeking to ensure the existence of many and diverse news sources and the
default 
defaultabsence of too much media power in one or a few hands is the only way of
default 
defaultpromoting range and diversity of information and
default opinion.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe statistics have been derived predominantly from Ofcom documents or from
default 
defaultreport documents commissioned by Ofcom. Abbreviations used in the text to refer to
default

defaultBBCʼs (Comparative) Presence in Radio News
default&#xa0;
defaultBBC UK-wid
defaulte radio stations include the top three radio stations used nowadays for
default 
defaultnews, these being Radio 4 (26%), Radio 2 (25%) and Radio 1 (19%) (A5 pp. 32-33
default 
defaultand Chart 3.4.4).
default&#xa0;
defaultIt may be observed of Chart 
default3.4.4 that 9 of the 15 featured radio stations are BBC
default 
defaultstations and that in aggregate BBC UK-wide stations account for two-thirds of those
default 
defaultwho use radio for news.
default&#xa0;
defaultBBCʼs (Comparative) Presence in Online News
default&#xa0;
defaultOf the 41% of UK adults who say they use the in
defaultternet for news, the main source
default 
defaultused is the BBC website or a BBC app (57%) (A4 4.39 and Fig. 10). Tying for
default 
defaultsecond place are Facebook and Google (19% each), with Sky News website or app
default 
defaultcoming third (17%).
default&#xa0;
defaultAccording to UKOM/Nielsen in December 2011 there
default were then nine online news
default 
defaultbrands reaching over 2 million people each month and of these the BBC had the
default 
defaulthighest reach, with 11 million people. DMGT and Yahoo were next, with 6.6 and 4.1
default 
defaultmillion respectively (A4 4.99 and Fig. 26). BSkyB came in with 1.3 m
defaultillion.
default&#xa0;
defaultEven when looking at the BBCʼs presence online in general terms, i.e. not restricted
default 
defaultto news, it is number five top site in the UK, first and second being google.co.uk and
default 
defaultgoogle.com, followed by facebook.com and youtube.com (Alexa)

default&#xa0;
defaultThe above
default statistics demonstrate that the BBC is a giant media entity in television,
default 
defaultradio and online and that it is a dominant presence on each of these platforms.
default 
defaultFurthermore it must not be forgotten that in the present day the dominance in these
default 
defaultmajor three plat
defaultforms has an interactive effect such as to 
defaultsuperchargdefaulte the overall
default 
defaultimpact of the BBC.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is also important to note that for all of its claims to special status (stemming from a
default 
defaultRoyal Charter, Editorial Guidelines, etc. etc.), in the all-important TV and o
defaultnline
default 
defaultplatforms the BBC is not awarded by the British public with a unique and lofty status
default 
defaultfor impartiality or trustworthiness.
