&#xa0;
[normal]Written evidence submitted by [bold]Kenneth MacLean [FBB0019][bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This submission is comprised of my replies to and observations relating to
[normal] 
[normal]questions set forth in the Committeeʼs press release of 22 October 2013.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I write as a person who
[normal] has listened to BBC radio since the 1940s and viewed
[normal] 
[normal]BBC television since the 1950s.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]At the end of this document is a statistics section which presents statistics
[normal] 
[normal]illustrative of the size of the BBC in the UK media world.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]What should the BBC be for and [bold]what should be the purpose of public[bold] [bold]service broadcasting?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Perhaps the easiest way to approach the first limb of this question is to ask
[normal] 
[normal]ʻ
[normal]What should the BBC 
[normal]not
[normal] be for?ʼ.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]My 
[normal]high level 
[normal]answer to this reversed question is both simple and emphatic:
[normal] 
[normal]the BB
[normal]C should not exist to provide the type and quality of radio, TV and
[normal] 
[normal]online content that is, or could be, provided by commercial media
[normal] 
[normal]organisations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If the BBC does little or nothing of significance over and above mimicking
[normal] 
[normal]private sector media organisati
[normal]ons, then it has no reason to exist at all.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]And for the avoidance of doubt, the veracity of this observation is in no way
[normal] 
[normal]lessened because the BBC happens to be a giant news and current affairs
[normal] 
[normal]organisation. Clearly, a raison dʼêtre
[normal] for the BBC cannot reside in its size
[normal] 
[normal]alone.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A further question thus arises, namely ʻDoes the BBC do anything of
[normal] 
[normal]significance that could not readily be done by other media organisations?ʼ.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I address this further question in my answer below to the Commit
[normal]teeʼs
[normal] 
[normal]question concerning the scope, scale and remit of the BBC.
[normal]How well has the BBC performed in the current Charter period in[bold] [bold]achieving its mission and public purposes?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Being but an ordinary viewer and listener, I was not familiar with the concept of
[normal] 
[normal]the BBCʼs mission but the BBC website soon informed me that the BBC has a
[normal] 
[normal]Mission ʻto enrich peopleʼs lives with programmes and services that inform,
[normal] 
[normal]educate and entertainʼ.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am obliged to the BBC in seeking to enrich me because my annual TV tax
[normal] 
[normal]together
[normal] with that of a multitude of others certainly enriches many senior
[normal] 
[normal]managers and celebrities at the BBC.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Googling the term ʻpublic purposesʼ immediately located it for me as being in
[normal] 
[normal]the BBC Charter. I was thus able to observe that the first Public Purpose
[normal] of the
[normal] 
[normal]BBC is ʻsustaining citizenship and civil societyʼ. I was left wondering if the
[normal] 
[normal]citizen is to exclaim “Gosh, what a wondrous thing is the BBC” or whether he
[normal] 
[normal]is to think to himself “Crikey, a bit Orwellian that!”.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]My seeking enlightenment in this 
[normal]vein also yielded an insight into the ways in
[normal] 
[normal]which the BBC Trust attempts to impart to the management the strategy that
[normal] 
[normal]the Trust has formulated and the tools that have been constructed for
[normal] 
[normal]attempting to monitor the performance of the management. In this 
[normal]context I
[normal] 
[normal]observed that there exist 
[normal]inter alia 
[normal]Strategic Objectives whereby, for example,
[normal] 
[normal]the Trust ʻchallengesʼ the BBC to increase the distinctiveness and quality of
[normal] 
[normal]output, Service Licences, Protocols, Public Purposes and Purpose Remits,
[normal] 
[normal]Annual Tracking
[normal] Surveys, Statements of Programme Policy and Summary
[normal] 
[normal]Workplans.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I conclude that the objectives given to the BBC by the Charter (plus
[normal] 
[normal]Framework Agreement) are largely of a high-flown flannel nature and that the
[normal] 
[normal]machinery for setting the direction of the BB
[normal]C and for assessing performance
[normal] 
[normal]is so hideously bureaucratic and so formulaic when put into practice that
[normal] 
[normal]meaningful results are hardly to be expected.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]For these reasons I am unable to provide a direct answer to the subject
[normal] 
[normal]question. I would, however, lik
[normal]e to attempt to provide some relevant
[normal] 
[normal]observations to the Committee, and these now follow.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I suggest that it is very useful in examining the BBCʼs performance to adopt a
[normal] 
[normal]long timescale and to concentrate on television services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Up until the mid-1950s the
[normal] BBC had a monopoly in TV and I distinctly remember, although I was a teenager, my apprehension when it was announced that commercial TV was to be introduced. I was worried that commercial TV would affect deleteriously the standards of BBC TV. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I cannot p
[normal]retend to remember the exact chronology, but the upshot over a
[normal] 
[normal]certain timescale was as feared. The BBC did not stand firm on quality
[normal] 
[normal]standards, but gave in to the temptation of attempting to maintain ratings as
[normal] 
[normal]against what it perceived to be rival servic
[normal]es.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The psychology of the BBCʼs reaction to the inception of commercial TV could
[normal] 
[normal]not be more simple. The BBC bigwigs apprehended that the punters who paid
[normal] 
[normal]the bigwigsʼ salaries and underpinned the bigwigsʼ careers would begin to
[normal] 
[normal]complain if they had to 
[normal]pay compulsorily a licence fee for programmes the
[normal] 
[normal]viewership figures of which fell below those of the commercial services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The adoption of the ratings chasing policy was thus driven by a desire for self
[normal]-
[normal]preservation.
[normal] 
[normal]In the demotic the policy goes, of cou
[normal]rse, by the name of ʻratings
[normal] 
[normal]warʼ. The BBC became adept at fighting the ratings war and it has maintained
[normal] 
[normal]to the present day its view that being active in that war is vital to the BBCʼs
[normal] 
[normal]continued existence.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This plain and simple fact about the BBC is publ
[normal]icly admitted by very few of
[normal] 
[normal]our parliamentarians. Indeed, the flow over the years of MPs and peers who
[normal] 
[normal]get upon their feet to proclaim that the BBC provides the ʻgold standardʼ of
[normal] 
[normal]broadcasting quality has never ceased.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Is it a prerequisite of being a pol
[normal]itician that one can selectively fail to see
[normal] 
[normal]elephants in the room? Whatever the answer to that question, the fact is that
[normal] 
[normal]whilst operating ostensibly under strict requirements as to the maintenance of
[normal] 
[normal]high standards, the BBC has in fact been permitted for
[normal] sixty years, and by all
[normal] 
[normal]parties, to consistently produce a general output at that low level which is
[normal] 
[normal]dictated by ratings considerations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This means that scandalously the public have been, and still are being,
[normal] 
[normal]charged, on a compulsory basis, for a sub-sta
[normal]ndard product.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What scope, scale and remit should the BBC have?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]As I intimated in my answer to the first question, the BBC should be
[normal] 
[normal]given scope, scale and remit only if it can provide output which is significantly
[normal] 
[normal]different from that which is deliverable by other organisations, including
[normal] 
[normal]commercial companies. A requirement additional to difference is, of course,
[normal] 
[normal]public value.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As I explained with reference to the second question, albeit that the BBC operates under a
[normal] cloak of ultra-respectable Public Purposes etc., it has in fact over a very long period chosen to maintain a dumbed down output as its continuous response to the output of what it sees as its rivals.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Here then we have a problematic situation. In choosing
[normal] to dumb down its
[normal] 
[normal]output to bolster its programme ratings the BBC has 
[normal]ipso facto 
[normal]brought itself
[normal] 
[normal]down to the level of its rivals. And in doing this, it has extinguished any
[normal] 
[normal]justification for claiming to be significantly different from its rivals.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]At this j
[normal]uncture perhaps I hear members of the Committee saying “But what
[normal] 
[normal]about the BBCʼs output of news and current affairs?”. “Surely everyone
[normal] 
[normal]acknowledges the BBCʼs pre-eminence in that sphere”.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Well, let us consider a comparison of the quality of a commercial 
[normal]TV news
[normal] 
[normal]service, Sky News, and a prominent BBC TV news service, BBC News 24.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It cannot be seriously said that one of these services is significantly
[normal] 
[normal]superior or significantly inferior to the other. Individuals may, of course, favour
[normal] 
[normal]one over the other bec
[normal]ause of personal preference or merely through
[normal] 
[normal]habit.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Here it is pertinent to note from the statistical section (pp. 14 &amp; 15) that
[normal] 
[normal]when it comes to users of the most used TV news sources, most rate
[normal] 
[normal]them reasonably highly in respect of accuracy, trustworthi
[normal]ness and impartiality.
[normal] 
[normal]And, as the table on page 15 shows, the news services of ITV and Sky are
[normal] 
[normal]rated very much on a par with those of the BBC.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The broadcast media have from their inception been seen as potent in their
[normal] 
[normal]potential for upholding the democrat
[normal]ic values of this country but representing
[normal] 
[normal]equally potently a threat to democracy should they to come under undesirable
[normal] 
[normal]control. At the nub of these considerations is the broadcasting of news.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Politicians, in providing for an appropriate framework for the
[normal] operation of the
[normal] 
[normal]broadcast media, have thus put special effort into attempting to ensure that all
[normal] 
[normal]radio and TV organisations which broadcast news items do so in a fair,
[normal] 
[normal]accurate, impartial etc. manner. Indeed, it may be said that the provision of
[normal] 
[normal]news acc
[normal]ording to these criteria lies at the very heart of the concept of public
[normal] 
[normal]service broadcasting, whether one has in mind the BBC or the public service
[normal] 
[normal]obligations of the other broadcasters.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Thus if it is the case that the public see BBC news provision as on
[normal] a level with
[normal] 
[normal]the news provision of other providers, that is, if it does not see the BBCʼs news
[normal] 
[normal]provision as being distinctly more accurate, trustworthy and impartial, then the
[normal] 
[normal]BBC has failed the 
[normal]Acid Test of Differentiation
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If there was any question of 
[normal]the TV news output of non-BBC organisations
[normal] 
[normal]being significantly inferior to that of the BBC as judged on the crucial criteria
[normal] 
[normal]aforementioned, this would be a matter of loud, prolonged and general debate,
[normal] 
[normal]not least,
[normal] 
[normal]of course, on prog
[normal]r
[normal]ammes such as 
[normal]Question
[normal] Time. 
[normal]No such debate
[normal] 
[normal]exists.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Now as I have already pointed out, in choosing to engage in the ratings war
[normal] 
[normal]the BBC has had to generally dumb down its output to the level of its rivals. As
[normal] 
[normal]to whether this general dumbing down includes the BBCʼs news and rel
[normal]ated
[normal] 
[normal]programmes can be left for debate, because as has been established the BBC
[normal] 
[normal]fails the news-specific 
[normal]Acid Test of Differentiation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The logic thus is that the BBC does not warrant scope, scale or remit because
[normal] 
[normal]its continued existence cannot be justified
[normal] on PSB grounds.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]That is not to say that the continued existence of the BBC at a drastically
[normal] 
[normal]reduced scale (size) might not be justified. On this basis I will now make some
[normal] 
[normal]remarks on the present size and scope of activities of the BBC and as to what
[normal] 
[normal]might be an appropriate size/scope in the future.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In my consideration of the size/scope of the present BBC I have in mind the
[normal] 
[normal]BBC as a provider of radio, TV and online services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]My contention is that the BBC is far too big. In my view the BBC has been
[normal] 
[normal]pe
[normal]rmitted to grow to such an extent that it now constitutes a danger to vital
[normal] 
[normal]elements of the UK media industry including commercial radio and TV,
[normal] 
[normal]national and local, and to local and national newspapers. The BBC is a grave
[normal] 
[normal]impediment to the establishment of
[normal] a healthily diverse media scene in the UK.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I will not dwell on the deleterious effects that BBC TV and radio are having on
[normal] 
[normal]the general media because I am certain that others far more authoritative than
[normal] 
[normal]I will make submissions to the Committee. All that I
[normal] will do is to underline the
[normal] 
[normal]fact that it is only in a healthily diverse media scene that the public are
[normal] 
[normal]exposed to a range of different opinions, views and information from a variety
[normal] 
[normal]of sources.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The dominance of the BBC over the three major platforms (TV
[normal], radio and online) is
[normal] 
[normal]amply testified to by facts presented in the statistics section, but it might be helpful
[normal] 
[normal]here to highlight some specific facts about the BBCʼs news dominance which are
[normal] 
[normal]revealed in the said section.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]According to one survey, 78% of those who follow the news use TV therefor,
[normal] 
[normal]with 40% using newspapers, 35% radio and 32% the internet. See 
[normal]p. 11
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]According to another survey, using slightly different methodology, the figures
[normal] 
[normal]are: TV 85%, radio and newspape
[normal]rs 53% each and internet 41%. See 
[normal]p. 12
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The BBCʼs cross-platform audience reach for news at the retail level is 86%,
[normal] 
[normal]the second and third places being taken by ITV (40%) and Sky (28%). See 
[normal]p.
[normal] 
[normal]13
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal][Clearly all three platforms, but especially TV, are impo
[normal]rtant for news and thus
[normal] 
[normal]dominance over three platforms, including TV, must be very concerning.]
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]75% of all TV news viewers use BBC One as a news source, the second most
[normal] 
[normal]used being ITV (42%). Also, of the top six TV news services, three are BBC.
[normal] 
[normal]See p. 
[normal]15
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The BBCʼs share of news by channel group increased between 2002 and 2011
[normal] 
[normal]from 59% to 74%. See p. 
[normal]14.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In respect of the BBC radio presence, the BBC UK-wide radio stations include
[normal] 
[normal]the top three radio stations (Radio 4, Radio 2 and Radio 1) used for news.
[normal] 
[normal]Moreover, out of the top fifteen stations, nine are BBC and in aggregate BBC
[normal] 
[normal]UK-wide radio stations account for two-thirds of those who use radio for news.
[normal] 
[normal]See p. 
[normal]15
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As to the BBC presence 
[normal]online
[normal], of the 41% of UK adults who use the internet
[normal] 
[normal]for news, 57% use the BBC website or a BBC app, with Facebook and Google
[normal] 
[normal]taking 19% share each. Sky takes 17%. See p. 
[normal]15
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In December 2011 there were nine online news brands reaching over 2 m
[normal] 
[normal]people per month. Of these the BBC had the highest reach with 1
[normal]1 m Second
[normal] 
[normal]and third came DMGT (6.6 m) and Yahoo (4.1 m). BSkyB came in with 1.3 m.
[normal] 
[normal]See p. 
[normal]15
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There can be no doubt that the BBC is a giant organisation 
[normal]per se. 
[normal]This can be
[normal] 
[normal]ready appreciated by merely examining the list of UK Public Services given in the
[normal] 
[normal]June 2006 Framework Agreement. And as amply demonstrated by the statistics
[normal] 
[normal]section, the BBC is a true monster in the news arena. It is thus not surprising that
[normal] 
[normal]according to a recent DCMS consultation document on media plurality, the 2011
[normal] 
[normal]news and current 
[normal]affairs spend of the BBC was more than that of the remaining UK
[normal] 
[normal]television and radio news broadcasters combined.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Added to the picture of overwhelming dominance in news provision is the startling
[normal] 
[normal]fact that the BBC possess this dominant position not only in
[normal] broadcasting but within
[normal] 
[normal]and across the three major news platforms of radio, TV and online.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Furthermore it is most important to have cognisance of the fact that owing to the
[normal] 
[normal]synergistic interaction between the platforms of the multi-platform BBC, the BBC 
[normal]has
[normal] 
[normal]a power more than congruent with the sum of its parts.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]All this very disturbing because what it means is that not only does the BBC fail to be
[normal] 
[normal]differentiated from other media organisations when it comes to TV broadcasting,
[normal] 
[normal]news or general, but in the 
[normal]news function it is a giant which holds an overwhelmingly
[normal] 
[normal]dominant position across radio, TV and online.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Thus all that does differentiate the BBC are the features of 1. giant size, 2. 
[normal]T
[normal]he
[normal] 
[normal]absence of advertisements (at least commercial ones) and 3. the imp
[normal]osition of the
[normal] 
[normal]TV tax.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the present context, as well as embracing the concept of size, the word ʼscopeʼ
[normal] 
[normal]connotes ʻrange of activitiesʼ and this raises a very serious and concerning aspect of
[normal] 
[normal]the BBC in its present form.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the BBC Charter one of the BB
[normal]Cʼs Public Purposes is ʻhelping to deliver to the
[normal] 
[normal]public the benefit of emerging communications technologiesʼ. In non-spin language
[normal] 
[normal]what this means is that the BBC is licensed to spend TV tax payersʼ money to
[normal] 
[normal]extend its activities from radio and TV to onli
[normal]ne. This is reflected in the 2006
[normal] 
[normal]Framework Agreement as ʻa comprehensive online content service, with content
[normal] 
[normal]serving the whole range of the BBCʼs Public Purposesʼ, meaning that the extension
[normal] 
[normal]to online is to be a wholesale one.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As above shown the BBC has
[normal] taken full advantage of this carte blanche and it has
[normal] 
[normal]spent highly - at an annual rate of £177m (2012/13 BBC Financial Statements) 
[normal]–
[normal] in
[normal] 
[normal]establishing its commanding presence for news online, although as noted in the
[normal] 
[normal]statistics section (pp. 15 &amp; 16) users o
[normal]f news websites rated Sky as fully equivalent
[normal] 
[normal]to the BBC for accuracy &amp; reliability, trustworthiness and impartiality &amp; lack of bias.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What then is so very serious and concerning about the BBCʼs so establishing itself in
[normal] 
[normal]the new communications medium of on
[normal]line? An indication was given very recently by
[normal] 
[normal]the Home Secretary in a speech she gave to a gathering of the Society of Editors. In
[normal] 
[normal]her speech Mrs May made the following observations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]Local newspapers are having a particularly hard time. That has been pa
[normal]rtly the
[normal] 
[normal]result of the BBCʼs dominant position on the internet, and its ability to subsidise the
[normal] 
[normal]provision of internet news using the licence fee. This makes it enormously difficult for
[normal] 
[normal]local newspapers to compete. If the BBC can, as they do, provide all t
[normal]he locally
[normal] 
[normal]significant news, what is left to motivate the local reader to buy a paper?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is destroying local newspapers and it could eventually happen to national
[normal] 
[normal]newspapers as well.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This is dangerous for local politics as it is for local journalism.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“This is a debate that wonʼt go away and I believe that the BBC has to think carefully
[normal] 
[normal]about its presence locally and the impact that has on local democracy.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]No doubt Mrs May, as a senior cabinet minister, was being somewhat circumspect with her comments
[normal] on the BBCʼs online services, but she certainly identified a grave threat to the print media, both local and national. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the years running up to the commencement of the present Charter it may have
[normal] 
[normal]appeared simply logical to permit the TV tax funded BBC
[normal] to extent itself onto the
[normal] 
[normal]new online platform. But with the advantage of hindsight we can see that what the
[normal] 
[normal]politicians did in giving the thumbs-up was rather like that done, with equal facility, by
[normal] 
[normal]the Sorcererʼs Apprentice.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Whereas news services of the
[normal] broadcast media are regulated as to impartiality, the
[normal] 
[normal]newspapers are left to grind whatever political or other axe their proprietors fancy.
[normal] 
[normal]Thus from a political point of view we have on the left the Daily Mirror, the Financial
[normal] 
[normal]Times, the Guardian and the
[normal] Independent, on the right the Daily Express, the Daily
[normal] 
[normal]Mail and the Telegraph and with a flexible approach (over time) to position on the
[normal] 
[normal]political spectrum the Sun and the Times.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The freedom of the press to choose attitudes to news items and issues 
[normal]provides the
[normal] 
[normal]public with an opportunity to be made aware of a wide range of arguments and
[normal] 
[normal]opinions and is 
[normal]at the very heart of our democracy in the UK
[normal].
[normal]Therefore any news media entity which poses an existential threat to the newspaper
[normal] 
[normal]industry, whether in 
[normal]respect of printed newspapers or online services, must be
[normal] 
[normal]examined by Parliament with the upmost seriousness and 
[normal]urgency, this being all the
[normal] 
[normal]more the case when the entity in question is a public sector entity and thus one
[normal] 
[normal]which is within the direct sphere 
[normal]of influence of Parliament.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In looking to the future, I am not at all sure what would be an appropriate remit for
[normal] 
[normal]the BBC. As I have indicated above, in the present era there would appear to no
[normal] 
[normal]more justification for a nationalised broadcaster and online 
[normal]operator than there is for
[normal] 
[normal]a public sector newspaper.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I do not, of course, expect to see the BBC disappear suddenly, but it is important to
[normal] 
[normal]the future of democracy in our country that as soon as possible it is drastically
[normal] 
[normal]decreased both in scope and scale
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In its present form the BBC is stifling media diversity and threatening the continued
[normal] 
[normal]existence of our newspapers. This means that the BBC constitutes a threat to our
[normal] 
[normal]democracy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A much reduced BBC, or a successor organisation, could have one of a numbe
[normal]r of
[normal] 
[normal]profiles, but as an indicator I would suggest that the following would be appropriate.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]TV [bold] [bold]One general channel approximating to an amalgam of present BBC One and
[normal] 
[normal]BBC Four, plus BBC Parliament Channel. No regional/local TV services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Radio [bold] [bold]Two
[normal] national channels, approximating respectively to present channels 4 and
[normal] 
[normal]3. No local stations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Online [bold] [bold]Excepting for content strictly connected with BBC services, such as
[normal] 
[normal]programme listings, BBC Online should be cut away from the BBC to form a
[normal] 
[normal]separate en
[normal]tity funded by subscription. An alternative would be a separation of BBC
[normal] 
[normal]News, including online news, from the remainder of the BBC, again funded by
[normal] 
[normal]subscription.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]My indications of a future BBC or successor will to some appear over-drastic, but
[normal] 
[normal]such is th
[normal]e state of the present BBC that in the interests of a healthy democracy it is
[normal] 
[normal]in dire need of brutal surgery.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Returning to the question of remit, in the light of my observations all I can advise is
[normal] 
[normal]that any new Public Purposes or the like are couched in 
[normal]terms less Orwellian and
[normal] 
[normal]less high-flown than is the case in the present Charter. I would also put in a plea that
[normal] 
[normal]the Big Brother/social engineering tenor of the PSB purposes and characteristics set
[normal] 
[normal]out by Ofcom in its PSB Annual Report 2013 (Fig. 1) is fi
[normal]rmly eschewed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What role should the BBC play in developing technology and new ways of[bold] [bold]distributing content?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The development of technology relating to TV, radio or online and novel modes of
[normal] 
[normal]distributing content/information/data is the province of the 
[normal]likes of Google, Apple and
[normal] 
[normal]Samsung, and not that of a UK public sector broadcasting organisation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How should the BBC be funded beyond 2016?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The TV tax is very unpopular, especially in view of the multitude of sources of
[normal] 
[normal]information and entertainment now 
[normal]available to the public on TV (and elsewhere).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In my view the idea of imposing a compulsory tax on the UK public in respect of one
[normal] 
[normal]out of a multitude of media outlets is a totally unjustified anachronism. Much would
[normal] 
[normal]be the rejoicing among the populace upo
[normal]n the lifting of this unfair imposition.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Looking at the matter from a different angle, if the BBCʼs current output truly
[normal] 
[normal]represents the gold standard of quality in broadcasting as some parliamentarians
[normal] 
[normal]regularly claim, why should not the BBC be funded, an
[normal]d funded only, by the
[normal] 
[normal]voluntary subscriptions of members of the public.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As set forth above, it is clear that the BBCʼs online services in respect of news are
[normal] 
[normal]threatening the continued existence of national and local newspapers. This supplies
[normal] 
[normal]another and v
[normal]ital reason as to why, if the BBC is to be permitted to continue to put
[normal] 
[normal]out news and current affairs online, the BBC should be funded on a subscription
[normal] 
[normal]basis.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We have had ample evidence of late as to the BBCʼs talent for wasting TV tax
[normal] 
[normal]payersʼ money as we
[normal]ll as to other management shortcomings. Thus an advantage of
[normal] 
[normal]funding the BBC on a subscription basis is that the BBC would, for the first time,
[normal] 
[normal]have to earn its income. This would tighten up management.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How should the BBC be governed, regulated and held a[bold]ccountable?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]It is surely clear that the replacement of BBC governors by the BBC Trust has been
[normal] 
[normal]a true failure. One cannot be surprise at this since any objective person would
[normal] 
[normal]perceive immediately that the concept of a body a part of the BBC being 
[normal]responsible
[normal] 
[normal]for overseeing the BBC and at the same time representing the TV tax payer was
[normal] 
[normal]doomed to failure.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Thus the BBC, whether it is to exist in the near future in its giant, overbearing,
[normal] 
[normal]competition suppressing , democracy threatening form or not, mu
[normal]st be regulated by
[normal] 
[normal]a body outside the BBC. Whether that body is Ofcom in its present or a modified
[normal] 
[normal]form is a moot point, but future regulation must be external of the BBC.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]UK Media Statistics[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]This statistics section presents statistics 
[normal]illustrative of the present shape of the UK
[normal] 
[normal]media and more especially of the extent of the BBCʼs operations and of the size of
[normal] 
[normal]its presence in the UK media world.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Emphasis is placed on the provision of news services. The reason for this is simply
[normal] 
[normal]that the
[normal] availability of a plurality of news sources is essential to the healthy working
[normal] 
[normal]of a democracy. In this context “plurality” connotes many rather than few news
[normal] 
[normal]services and, just as importantly, the avoidance of any one media organisation
[normal] 
[normal]having too much i
[normal]nfluence over public opinion and over the political process.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Seeking to ensure the existence of many and diverse news sources and the
[normal] 
[normal]absence of too much media power in one or a few hands is the only way of
[normal] 
[normal]promoting range and diversity of information and
[normal] opinion.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The statistics have been derived predominantly from Ofcom documents or from
[normal] 
[normal]report documents commissioned by Ofcom. Abbreviations used in the text to refer to
[normal] 
[normal]such documents are as follows.

[normal]Media Generally[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]91% of UK adults say they follow the news. 78% use TV for news, 40%
[normal] use print
[normal] 
[normal]newspapers, 35% use radio and 32% use the internet (CMR13 1.9.3 &amp; Fig. 1.93).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]When respondents were asked to what extent they used each platform for types of
[normal] 
[normal]news, i.e. serious news items, breaking news, headlines &amp; summaries, opinions &amp;
[normal] 
[normal]debate
[normal]s and in-depth analysis, TV dominated in each of the 5 categories, only losing
[normal] 
[normal]its dominance when it came to light hearted stories and rumour &amp; gossip (A4 Fig. 2).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]By way of example, A4 Fig. 2 shows that for serious news 81% said they used TV,
[normal] 
[normal]whereas the
[normal] scores for newspapers, radio and the internet were 42%, 38% &amp; 44%
[normal] 
[normal]respectively.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Using somewhat different methodology, Kantar Media reported (A5) that 95% of UK
[normal] 
[normal]adults claim to follow the news via at least one of the four major platforms and that
[normal] 
[normal]TV has t
[normal]he highest reach at 85%, followed by radio and newspapers with 53% each
[normal] 
[normal]and internet with 41%. Internet news usage is on a growing trend (A4 4.8).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]When consumers were asked to rate the importance of platforms to them and the
[normal] 
[normal]ratings were plotted against p
[normal]ercentage usage for news, TV was rated highest in
[normal] 
[normal]importance at 88%, with radio and newspapers both at 55% and internet on
[normal] 
[normal]computer at 37% (A5 Chart 3.1.1b).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In 1970 73% of UK adults used newspapers as a source of news. In 2012 it was
[normal] 
[normal]53% (A4 4.7).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]41% 
[normal]of UK adults use internet for news (A4 4.8).
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]BBC Services[bold]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]According to the BBC itself (

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]BBC Online is 49th of the top 500 sites on the web worldwide (Alexa).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]BBC news services across platforms
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]BBCʼs 
[normal]cross-platform audience reach for news at the retail level is 86%, the
[normal] 
[normal]second and 
[normal]third places being taken by ITV (40%) and Sky (28%) (A4 Fig. 12 -
[normal] 
[normal]reproduced as Fig. 2 in the Consultation Document).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]BBC One (TV) is the most popular news source of news sources 
[normal]across all
[normal] 
[normal]platforms
[normal], with 57% of people using it. It is followed by ITV wit
[normal]h 33%. The top
[normal] 
[normal]newspapers for news are the Sun (10%) and the Daily Mail (8%). The two most
[normal] 
[normal]popular radio stations for news are BBC Radio 2 and BBC Radio 4 (8% each).
[normal] 
[normal](CMR13, p. 107 &amp; Fig. 1.94)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Of the top ten news services six are BBC, including those 
[normal]placed first,
[normal] 
[normal]third and
[normal] 
[normal]fourth (Fig. 1.94). Of the top twenty news services featured in Fig. 1.94 eight are
[normal] 
[normal]BBC, these being 4 TV stations, 3 radio stations and the BBC website.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]When news users were ask to name their most important single news source, 34%
[normal] 
[normal]said BBC One (CMR13, Fig 1.103). ITV was second with 13%. The top newspaper
[normal] 
[normal]according to this criterion was The Sun (1%). Of the eleven ʻmost importantʼ
[normal] 
[normal]sources named in Fig. 1.103 six are BBC sources.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]BBCʼs (Comparative) Presence in TV News
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]75% of all TV news viewers use BBC One as a news source, the second most used
[normal] 
[normal]such source for these viewers being ITV (42%) (A4 Fig. 6).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Fig 6 also shows that of the top six TV news services, three are BBC.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]According to A4 4.83, the total amount of time 
[normal]that adults spend watching the news
[normal] 
[normal]on TV increased gradually between 2007 and 2011, standing at 21 minutes per day
[normal] 
[normal]in 2011, this being predominantly driven by an increase in time spent viewing the
[normal] 
[normal]BBC.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]According to A4 4.84 and Fig. 18, the BBCʼs share of
[normal] TV viewing of news by
[normal] 
[normal]channel group increased between 2002 and 2011 from 59% to 74%, whereas that of
[normal] 
[normal]ITV decreased from 29% to 14%. In 2011 the figures for Channel 4, Channel 5 and
[normal] 
[normal]Sky were 3%, 2% &amp; 8% respectively.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Reference to CMR13 Fig. 1.95 shows tha
[normal]t in 2012 BBC 1 and 2 plus BBC News
[normal] 
[normal]accounted for 75% of TV news viewing, with “BBC other” accounting for another
[normal] 
[normal]13%.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A4 4.86 and Fig. 19 indicate that in 2011 news programmes on BBC One reached
[normal] 
[normal]65% of the adult population in an average week.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]When it co
[normal]mes to users of the most used TV news sources, most rate them
[normal]reasonably highly in respect of accuracy, trustworthiness and impartiality.

[normal]Clearly, whereas BBC is dominant in TV news viewing, it is only average when
[normal] 
[normal]judged by TV news viewers in respect of these fundamental criteria of news
[normal] 
[normal]reportage.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]BBCʼs (Comparative) Presence in Radio News
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]BBC UK-wid
[normal]e radio stations include the top three radio stations used nowadays for
[normal] 
[normal]news, these being Radio 4 (26%), Radio 2 (25%) and Radio 1 (19%) (A5 pp. 32-33
[normal] 
[normal]and Chart 3.4.4).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It may be observed of Chart 
[normal]3.4.4 that 9 of the 15 featured radio stations are BBC
[normal] 
[normal]stations and that in aggregate BBC UK-wide stations account for two-thirds of those
[normal] 
[normal]who use radio for news.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]BBCʼs (Comparative) Presence in Online News
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Of the 41% of UK adults who say they use the in
[normal]ternet for news, the main source
[normal] 
[normal]used is the BBC website or a BBC app (57%) (A4 4.39 and Fig. 10). Tying for
[normal] 
[normal]second place are Facebook and Google (19% each), with Sky News website or app
[normal] 
[normal]coming third (17%).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]According to UKOM/Nielsen in December 2011 there
[normal] were then nine online news
[normal] 
[normal]brands reaching over 2 million people each month and of these the BBC had the
[normal] 
[normal]highest reach, with 11 million people. DMGT and Yahoo were next, with 6.6 and 4.1
[normal] 
[normal]million respectively (A4 4.99 and Fig. 26). BSkyB came in with 1.3 m
[normal]illion.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Even when looking at the BBCʼs presence online in general terms, i.e. not restricted
[normal] 
[normal]to news, it is number five top site in the UK, first and second being google.co.uk and
[normal] 
[normal]google.com, followed by facebook.com and youtube.com (Alexa)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Users of news
[normal] websites rated the broadcasters BBC and Sky fairly evenly across

[normal]*********************
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The above
[normal] statistics demonstrate that the BBC is a giant media entity in television,
[normal] 
[normal]radio and online and that it is a dominant presence on each of these platforms.
[normal] 
[normal]Furthermore it must not be forgotten that in the present day the dominance in these
[normal] 
[normal]major three plat
[normal]forms has an interactive effect such as to 
[normal]supercharg[bold]e the overall
[normal] 
[normal]impact of the BBC.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is also important to note that for all of its claims to special status (stemming from a
[normal] 
[normal]Royal Charter, Editorial Guidelines, etc. etc.), in the all-important TV and o
[normal]nline
[normal] 
[normal]platforms the BBC is not awarded by the British public with a unique and lofty status
[normal] 
[normal]for impartiality or trustworthiness.
