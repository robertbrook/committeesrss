default1. 
defaultThe Children’s Rights Alliance for England (CRAE) seeks the full implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) in 
defaultEngland
default. Our vision is of a society where the human rights of all children are recognised and realised. CRAE protects
default the human rights of children by lobbying government and others who hold power, by bringing or supporting test cases and by using national, regional and international human rights mechanisms. We provide legal information, raise awareness of children’s huma
defaultn rights, and undertake research about children’s access to their rights. We mobilise others, including children and young people, to take action to promote and protect children’s human rights. Each year we publish a review of the state of children’s right

default&#xa0;defaultIntroductiondefault&#xa0;default2
default. 
defaultIn 2010
default the Government made a commitment to give due 
defaultconsideration to the 
defaultUnited Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) 
defaultwhen making new law and policy
default. 
defaultThe Government must comply with this commitment when shaping 
defaultits policy in respect of legal aid.
default Any 
defaultreform to legal aid must ensure that it respects, protects and fulfils children’s rights.

default.
default&#xa0;
default3. 
defaultLegal aid is central to the rule of law – it ensures accountability in the event that public bodies breach the law, including those laws which 
defaultprotect
default children’s rights, by allowing people 
defaultto 
defaultcomplain to the courts. Legal aid also makes the law effecti
defaultve outside of the court room. It makes it a realistic possibility that people can bring a case when their rights are breached – this possibility encourages public bodies to comply with the law. It is also 
defaultan essential element of a fair justice system
default, ensu
defaultring that it is not only the rich and powerful who can access the courts by providing a vital safety net for those who cannot afford to pay for legal assistance. 
defaultLegal aid is an important aspec
defaultt of the right to a fair trial
default and the right to a remedy
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default4
default. 
defaultChildren’s rights, as enshrined in the law, are meaningless un
defaultless children can take action
default 
defaultwhen their
default rights are 
defaultviolated
default. An effective system of legal aid is crucial to ensuring that children are able to access the court to challenge breaches of their ri
defaultghts. This is recognised by the international human rights bodies. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has said:
defaultFor rights to have meaning, effective remedies must be available to redress violations.  This requirement is implicit in the 
default[UNCRC]
default an
defaultd consistently referred to in the other six major international human rights treaties.  Children’s special and dependent status creates real difficulties for them in pursuing remedies for breaches of their rights.  So States need to give particular attenti
defaulton to ensuring that there are effective, child-sensitive procedures available to children and their representatives.  These should 
defaultinclude 
default…
default access to independent complaints procedures and to the courts with necessary legal and other assistance.

default&#xa0;
defaultThe proposed introduction of a residence test for civil legal aid claimants, so as to limit legal aid to those with a “strong connection” with the defaultUKdefault&#xa0;default7
default. 
defaultCRAE does not agree with 
defaultthe introduction of a resi
defaultdence test for civil legal aid claimants
default.
default 
defaultChildren may have strong cases in relation to crucial aspects of their human rights, such as community care, housing and private family law cases, but be unable to meet the residency test. For example, 
defaultunrecognised
default 
defaulttrafficked children who do not claim asylum
default, the children of undocumented migrants, and British children born abroad
default may all be unable to bring proceedings when their rights are breached if this proposal is implemented
default. 
defaultFurthermore, the test is likely to 
defaulthave a discriminatory impact on certain groups of children, in breach of children’
defaults right
default to access justice without discrimination. 
defaultThere must be access to justice and equality before the law for all. The residence test
default clearly undermines both 
defaultof 
defaultthese pri
defaultnciples
default.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe proposed restriction on the scope of legal aid available to prisonersdefault&#xa0;default8
default. 
defaultCRAE does not agree with the proposal to 
defaultcut
default legal aid for 
defaulttreatment cases
default.
default All aspects of prison law should remain within the scope of legal aid for children.
default9
default. 
defaultThe UNCRC is clear that t
defaulthose children who are placed in custody do not lose their fundamental rights, and must continue to enjoy these to the full extent compatible with their deprivation of liberty. This means that children in custody should enjoy all of
default their rights, including adequate food, clothes, health care, education, family contact, religion and belief, 
defaultplay, privacy and protection from violence and abuse. 
defaultYet CRAE’s work has shown that 
defaultchildren in custody are highly vulnerable to treatment which 
defaultbreaches their rights whilst in prison. 
defaultIt is vital that 
defaultchildren should have 
defaultaccess to legal representation to challenge any 
defaultsuch abuses
default. 
default&#xa0;
default1

default. 
defaultThe 
defaultGovernment’s 
defaultproposals are based on 
defaultthe 
defaultnotion that 
defaultinternal complaints 
defaultprocedures 
defaultprovide an adequate means of 
defaultredress in respect of
default 
defaulttreatment
default 
defaultissues. 
defaultHowever, 
defaultsuch 
defaultprocedures 
defaulthave been shown to be inadequate to address children’s rights abuses in the past
default.
default 
defaultIn a judicial review brought by CRAE the court found that if a child had 
defaultcomplained in relation to unlawful restraint ‘
defaulthe would have been met with the riposte that it was perfectly permissible
default’.
default Without recourse to a court, 
defaultinternal complaints mechanisms do not
default secure a
defaultccess to justice for children. 
defaultThe proposed changes to the
default scope of 
defaultlegal aid in relation to prison matters
default will substantially reduce the prospect of external legal scrutiny and accordingly the authorities’ 
defaultaccountability for abuses of children’s rights whilst in prison
default. 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultThe proposal that providers of legal services in applications for judicial review against public bodies should only be paid for work done on the case if the Court grants permission for the application to proceed default&#xa0;

default. 
defaultCRAE does not agree with this 
defaultproposal.
default 
defaultAs the 
defaultMinistry of Justice itself recognised in its earlier consultation on legal aid
default:
default&#xa0;
defaultIn our view, proceedings where the litigant is seeking to hold the state to account by judicial review are important, because these cases are the means to wh
defaultich individual citizens can seek to check the exercise of executive power by appeal to the judiciary. These proceedings therefore represent a crucial way of ensuring that state power is exercised responsibly
default.

default. 
defaultJudicial review is a vital 
defaultlegal 
defaultsafeguard against an unlawful 
defaultor unreasonable 
defaultdecision, 
defaultact or omission by a public
default body
default. 
defaultNot only is it central to 
defaultpromoting good decision-making by public bodies by making them accountable to the public 
defaultbut 
defaultit 
defaultalso provides an important means 
defaultby which in
defaultdividuals can hold the state to account 
defaultand seek redress 
defaultin the event that 
defaulta public body
default do
defaultes
default act unlawfully or 
defaultin breach of a child’s fundamental rights. 
defaultAs previously highlighted by the Children’s Commissioner,
default judicial review proceedings have been wide
defaultly used to uphold children’s rights in nearly every area covered by the UNCRC
default.
default&#xa0;
default1
default3
default. 
defaultThe proposals will undermine the ability of legal representatives to offer legal advice in respect of judicial review, by requiring them to bear the risk that the case may 
defaultbe unsuccessful. 
defaultThis will undermine access to justice for children where their rights have been breached. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultThe proposal that legal aid should be removed for all cases assessed as having “borderline” prospects of successdefault&#xa0;default1
default4
default. 
defaultCRAE does not agree with this proposal. 
defaultThe pro
defaultposals could encourage a risk-a
defaultverse approach by legal providers that would 
defaultundermine access to justice for
default children 
defaultwhere their rights have been breached
default.
default&#xa0;

default5
default. 
defaultIt is often difficult to establish at the outset whether a case is weak or strong. 
defaultAn assessment of a 
defaultchild’s 
defaultcase as borderline
default means that there remains a 
defaultsignificant 
defaultchance that there will be a successful outcome.  
defaultIt does not mean that the case is witho
defaultut merit. 
defaultIt simply may not be possible to assess the merits of the case accur
defaultately because, for example, 
defaultof 
defaultdisputed law or
default fact
defaults
default. 
defaultChildren in such cases should not be denied access to justice.
default&#xa0;
default1
default6
default. 
defaultAppropriate legal representation will be particularly 
defaultim
defaultportant 
defaultin securing access to justice for children in such
default borderline cases which, by definition, are not clear cut. Without representation, 
defaultthere is a serious risk that borderline cases will fail at first instance.  
default&#xa0;
default1
default7
default. 
defaultBorderline cases are often those 
defaultwhich allow the law to develop, and as such are of importance to
default 
defaultthe 
defaultindividual child concerned a
defaultnd to the wider public interest. I
defaultt is crucial that 
defaultsuch cases receive the necessary funding to allow important points of law to be tested.
