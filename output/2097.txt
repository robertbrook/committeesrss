[[[&#xa0;]]]Written evidence from Sanjeev Appicharla (SLC 015)&#xa0;The author has relied upon Systems for Investigation of Railway Interface (SIRI) Methodology to elicit the latent errors that adversely impact safety at level crossings. The details and application case studies of accident(s) using the SIRI Methodology have been published at the IET International System Safety Engineering Conferences [19],[20],[21]. The individual or collective human factor information processing model is based upon the Jens Rasmussen’s Skill-Rules-Knowledge Framework. This is an accepted Framework by human factors academics as well as practitioners [15].   &#xa0;The Parliamentary Note SN 3255 dated 26 January 2012 note sets out the responsibilities of relevant bodies for the safety management of level crossings [14]. It sets out the government and industry’s views on the safety management of level crossings. The document does not contain any formal information model to guide the thinking.  The Figure 3 in this submission provides a partial map of GB stakeholder organisations and the internal departments of Network Rail directly involved in the day to day life of railways. As far as possible, in accordance with the International Standard IEC 15288, this map represents the relations and inter-relations between agencies from whole –part, client –supplier and support-supported perspective in a recursive manner [12]. Client –supplier perspective may be taken to represent end-means perspective as well. The clients namely, people and goods waiting to be transported from one place to another for the GB Rail Industry are represented at the top. The various organisations that compose the GB Rail Industry as a supplier of transport services are assumed to co-ordinate and co-operate their decision and actions to accomplish the work or task of transporting people and goods from one place to another. However, this structural map is insufficient to provide information on the functional organisation of the work or task of transporting people and goods from one place to another and the unwanted outcomes that may result. Therefore, author uses Jens Rasmussen’s Human Performance Shaping Factors (SRK) Framework and recommendations contained in the UK Health and Safety Executive’s Guidance Document Number 238 to populate Management Oversight and Risk Tree as a fault tree representation using cause-effect reasoning to map the harm suffered by people or goods or staff as a result of accident to the agencies involved [15],[24]. Thus, cognitive errors induced into subjective judgements and decisions regarding the hazardous situations are avoided. Failing to learn right lessons from accidents due to cognitive limitations of human information processing ability are, thus, avoided[15],[16].  Researchers like James Reason (1990) and Jens Rasmussen, Annelise Mark Pejtersen and L.P. Goodstein (1994) and Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman  have drawn author’s attention to the fact that false hypothesis of human error and hindsight bias distort the safety risk perceptions[5],[15],[16].  The functional division of the work or task of transporting people and goods from one place to another is currently organised by the Railway Undertaking(s) namely  freight and train operating companies by accessing the track infrastructure provided by the Infrastructure Manager, Network Rail. The Performance Regime and Common Safety Regime are regulated by the ORR whereas the Department of Transport organises franchises and draws up high level requirements to be delivered by Network Rail in the form of High Level Output Specification (HLOS). The ORR prepares Statement of Funds Available (SOFA) and regulates safety by means of prosecuting of duty-holders under the UK Health and Safety Work Act 1974.   The examination of the Schedules by which delays are attributed to the various parties are not relevant to the theme of rail-road interface and thus, left out of the discussions. Nobel Laureate Gary Baker’s Human Capital provides insight into how the work of 20th specialists is co-ordinated within firms and across firms and the role of engineering institutions played in the development of specialisation since 19th century. Gary Baker reckons that 19th century engineers were not specialised [9]. But due to excessive specialisation, 20th specialists may fail to know about the work of other specialities. As per the website information, RSSB is an industry’s co-originating body to support activity amongst its various members numbering 60 and shown in the Figure 3: System View of GB Rail Stakeholder Organisation Map. Railway Group Standards (RGSs) are documents that define mandatory engineering and operational requirements in respect of the mainline railway. The central purpose of RGSs is to enable the different participants in the industry to co-operate safely and efficiently where they need to do so, without having to reinvent the basis of that co-operation every time. Compliance with RGSs is mandatory, through licence conditions, and the content of each RGS is developed and agreed by the GB railway industry, through Standards Committees facilitated by RSSB.RSSB’s role includes drafting the content of standards and assessing their impact, as well as managing meetings, carrying out consultations, and publishing the standards themselves.The CSM relies upon the decision criteria of Expert Judgement to decide whether a change is significant or not. If the change is significant then the procedures within the CSM apply. The results of the technical review are presented in the form of latent errors that endanger the application of the CSM, a risk based approach. As per the clause 4.2 of the European Railway Safety Directive, and article 2 of the Common Safety Method, the Railway organisations must have a system in place to control changes/new projects and manage related risks, taking into account also those relating to occupational safety. Changes can apply to technique/technologies; operational procedures/rules/standards; organisational structure. As per the clause of article 4 (2) of the Railway Safety Directive and article 15(1) of the Railway Interoperability Directive, for a significant change a system approach and a risk assessment is necessary to ensure a safe integration and operation of the structural sub-systems covered by TSI within the system[7],[8]. The ORR Review on the CSM and Level Crossings, based upon their website information, is presented hereafter. The ORR Guidance document notes,” that the CSM presents three ‘risk acceptance principles’ by which the hazards associated with a significant change can be analysed and evaluated:  a) the application of codes of practice, b) a comparison with similar systems (reference systems)  and c)  an explicit risk estimation.  Risk assessment associated with significant organisational changes is not an exact science; it is about managing and organising people, therefore a qualitative or semi-quantitative risk ranking method for assessing organisational changes should meet the requirements of the CSM. There is no defined methodology currently available for risk assessment of organisational change (clause 18). A qualitative risk assessment based on a structured workshop process and the management of a hazard record derived from the workshops should be adequate to meet the requirements of the CSM”.The ORR Guidance Note on Level Crossings notes the following:” The law relating to level crossings is not straightforward as there is a need to balance the interests of road and rail, and take account of the impact of local circumstances that affect the use of the crossing. The law applying to level crossings has evolved over the past 160 years. No single government department controls all level crossing legislation. Currently, laws relating to the highways, railways and health and safety apply.The Law Commission for England and Wales and the Scottish Law Commission are undertaking a joint review of the existing law governing level crossings”.Author has noted that adjusting the laws and regulations applicable to safety by politicians and accident investigators every X years or analysing hazardous events respectively is a method of control by trial and error method.  This is in contrast to the Cognitive Systems Engineering Framework advanced by Jens Rasmussen, Annelise Mark Pejtersen and L.P. Goodstein. This idea of control by trial and error by national politicians to correct for experienced problems is referenced from Jens Rasmussen, Annelise Mark Pejtersen and L.P. Goodstein (pp 18)[15]. Author accepts James Reason’s argument that person’s (decision maker) distance from the front -line activities (and incidentally, from direct hazards) the greater is their potential danger to the system (pp174)[16].James Reason (1990) whilst advancing a general view of accident causation in complex systems noted that identifying latent errors is the challenge faced by human factors researchers concerned with the preserving the safety of complex, high risk systems (pp210)[16] . Author  of this submission notes this focus on ergonomic or behavioural aspects of human beings excludes cybernetic engineers, philosophers, lawyers, organisational theorists and practitioners, and parliamentarians who have to face this challenge as well(pp138-139)[15]. This is because Jens Rasmussen et all argued that actual work systems like railway transport system involve several nested closed-loops with adaptive and self-organising features (pp18-19)[15]. Thus, it is necessary to examine intra- organisational factors and organisational factors that can impact the safety performance in an adverse manner. However, author of this submission does not agree to the ORR idea that there are no qualitative methodologies currently available for risk assessment of organisational change and identifies this as latent error. Author, faced with a challenge of assuring changes to rules and regulations from organisational perspective are safe, conducted a personal survey in 2005. This survey revealed to the author that James Reason’s conceptual framework –the generic error –modelling system (GEMS) can be used to locate the origins of the basic human error types associated with a significant change to individual role in an organisation in conjunction with Swiss Cheese Model. Nancy Leveson’s New Accident Model, STAMP methodology is another methodology available. Management Oversight and Oversight and Risk Tree (engineering model) in conjunction with Jens Rasmussen’s Skill-Rules-Knowledge Framework (human factors model) is another methodology under the name System for Investigation of Railway Interfaces is another methodology available [13],[15],[16],[19]. This can help understand the overall context shaping this behaviour of human elements within a complex system. Sir Charles Haddon Cave investigating the NIMROD Aircraft accident used a hybrid model of Bow Tie Model (engineering model) and Swiss Cheese Model (human factors model) to investigate the contribution of organisational factors as well[4]. The Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the author’s Updated version and James Reason’s original Swiss Cheese Models. These figures do not show feedback loops and their variety and sensitivity as per James Reason’s cybernetic model (pp210)[16]. James Reason’s cybernetic model is accepted by the author and can be represented as loops feed backing opposing the latent failures through modelling accident(s). A similar approach is taken by Prof R.A. Smith of Imperial College, London (ICL) to perform systemic analysis of railway accidents (2005). This paper can be accessed from the R.A. Smith’s ICL website.

[[[Stages of development of organisational accident as per updated Swiss Cheese Model]]]The division of human error cited by James Reason (1990) is due to Rasmussen and Pedersen (1984), (pp173-174)[16]. An entire chapter is devoted to the concept of human error Rasmussen, J., Pejtersen A.M., Goodstein, L.P(1994) (pp 135-159)(15].  The Industry ‘s view point is that at level crossings, some 95% of the risk of accidents arises through some form of misuse by road users – split between a lack of understanding (errors) and wilful acts (violations) can be seen from any of the RSSB’s presentation on Safety at Level Crossings. But this fact statement focusses only on user error’s and does not reveal fallible decisions (latent errors) that kick started the accident sequence (Figure 1). The Updated Swiss Cheese Model (Figure 2) can be validated using the following description of active and latent errors. 

[[[Definition]]]: Active errors are human errors, whose effects are felt almost immediately. For example, a road user entering the level crossing space when it is not safe to do so as in the case of Herefordshire Level Crossing Accident in 2010[21]. This active error affects the risk management practices in an adverse manner at the individual level. The Highway Codes are cumbersome for road users is a noted factors in the UK HSE Research Project published in 2005[25]. 

[[[Definition]]]: Latent errors are human errors whose adverse consequences may lie dormant within the system for a long time, only becoming evident when they combine with other factors to breach system (production) defences.  Author accepts James Reason idea of latent error is intimately bound up with the character of technology and argued that tackling latent errors is the most effective way to improve safety of complex systems (pp174)[16].The following latent errors came to author’s attention in connection with the level crossings. HMRI in the post war years (1945-67) did not pay attention to inherent dangers with the introduction of automatic half barrier crossing technology replacing manned gate crossings. These dangers became evident with the Hixon accident when all the organisations (both railway and non- railway) failed to process the information available with them and the Hixon accident manifested. This is the first instance where the accident investigator used Newtonian mechanics to advise time to arrive be increased from 24 to 32 seconds. Another accident took place at the same site and a bridge was finally built despite the opposing legal requirements and economic arguments (pp46) [22]. The Network Rail signalling project team did not install approaching locking function at the Herefordshire level crossing to prevent the barrier being opened when the signal was cleared for the train causing the accident or civil engineers failing to install bridge at the site or did not locate the stop signal correctly at the site thereby affects the risk management practices in an adverse manner at the level of department level inside Network Rail [21]. Or using FN curves in the form of RSSB Safety Risk Model or using mathematical model of Poisson without paying heed to Andrew Evans’s cautionary advice that empirical or Poisson curves do not provide objective decision criteria for societal risk acceptance in 2003. Further, these models are unable to represent human errors occurring at higher levels of the industry. These latent errors affect the railway practices of risk assessment in an adverse manner at the Industry level [23]. Or the idea expressed by RSSB publication in 2011 that check list of hazards suffices affect the railway practices of risk assessment in an adverse manner at the company level [11]. Or the idea expressed by Stanley Hall and Peter Van Der Mark, GB Rail domain experts, in 2008 that the replacement of level crossings by bridges is the only complete answer, but a cost which is most cases is not justified by the incremental increase in safety. Author is of the opinion that 1,000 odd public level crossings can be replaced with bridges to prevent future disasters, if topography permits. Where topography does not permit, full barrier crossings with TPWS may be installed [22]. Or decision of the 19th century parliament to enact 1842 Railway Regulation Act requiring the Board of Trade powers in Section 13 to authorise railway companies to construct bridges in place of level crossings at their own expense, although it did not give the Board the powers to compel them to do so affect the railway practices of risk assessment and management in an adverse manner at the industry and regulatory level. The section 46 of 1845 states the same requirements but Special Act can override this requirement (pp10) [22]. Or lack of legal and judicial clarity between the various legislative Special Acts concerning Level Crossings and HSWA 1974 as identified by the Law Commission and Scottish Law Commission in 2010 leading to sub-optimal actions by duty-holders. Or failure of the Law Commission and Scottish Law Commission to identify the 1842 Railway Regulation Act as part of their review in 2010. Or decisions of Local authorities to oppose the move to close the public level crossings proposed by Network Rail[20]. Or Network Rail to decision to adopt All Level Crossing Risk Model which does not model and analyse latent errors to prioritise risk posed by level crossings. Or  Network Rail failure to learn lessons by taking a decision to adopt Bow Tie Model as Enterprise Risk Management Model in its April 2013 web communication despite the evidence provided by Sir Charles Haddon Cave in 2009 as to Bow Tie Model’s unsuitability to model organisational factors[4]. Or failure of RSSB and Network Rail to learn from the insight generated by James Reason (1990) that probability or quantitative risk assessments using fault and event trees do not incorporate human errors that seed latent faults into the system when developing the Engineering Safety Management Best Practice in 2000[16],[26]. Or all researchers failing to notice that the level crossing indicators installed are different from traditional signalled traffic lights that regulate road traffic movements. Or British Transport Police’s action to prosecute road users in conjunction with Network Rail for the violation of their duties without recognising the fact the right of way of passage afforded to horse cart users on public highways dates back to ancient times or not paying attention to the fact that there are more than 100 factors that affect the perception of the road users as identified by the UK HSE Report in 2005[25].  Or RAIB failure that to see that RSSB Railway Group Standard failed to specify sufficient braking distance at the protective signal at the Herefordshire Level Crossing Accident in 2011[21]. Or RSSB, RAIB, and ORR failing to notice that Author had pointed out in 2010 that Standards Committee composed by Subject Matter Experts suffers from Group-think Bias thus inserting latent errors into Railway Group Standards by taking risky options [17],[18],[20],[21]. Or Safety Culture of the Industry is still needs to improve as noted by Imperial College London in 2012[2]. Or RSSB and Industry failing to notice that ALARP Principle of Risk Management requires a Code of Practice to be followed and Railway Group Standard(s)on Level Crossing do not constitute Best Practice due to Group-think bias as identified by author  in 2006,2010,2011[19],[20],[21]. The claim that decisions of the RSSB  Standards Committe are fallible by author is supported by RAIB’s report 11/2012. This report states that RSSB the RSSB Standards Committee approved a safety critical deviation to the ERTMS/ETCS Cambrian Project waiving the integration of level crossing functionality into the new signalling systems [18]. Or the writers of the RAIB Report 12/2011 suffer from false dichotomy of subject-object divide when examining the safety of AOCL level crossings. The above latent errors discussed do not represent the stochastic errors, as envisaged by James Reason, that combine to create holes in the physical or administrative barriers to aid the dangerous flow of events that result in the level crossing accident(pp199)[16]. Thus, author wishes to note that ORR observation that organisational factors cannot be identified is not true nor the RSSB or duty –holders have put in sufficient efforts to identify systemic (latent errors in their risk management practices and decision making process at the Standards Committee Level) factors before rushing to blame the individual users for the risk at the rail-road interfaces. &#xa0;Reflecting upon the foregoing, author concludes that members of public have suffered accidents at public and non –public level crossings for the failure of engineers, managers, accident investigators, regulators and government agencies to foresee harm that can result from the inherent danger posed by the automation of level crossings and failure to de-couple the road and rail industries by means of bridges, under-pass or over -pass. The GB Rail safety standards or Railway Signalling Principles do not require the crossing space between the railway and roads to afford free passage to the road user. The miracle cure of Train Protection and Warning System against two centuries old safety problem of train collision(s) had to be legislated as the industry in 1999-2000 failed to foresee its safety benefits and argued against it. Author appeals to the Members of the Transport Select Committee to initiate reforms to the current legal and regulatory practices to afford safety at rail-road interfaces by combating the above latent errors. The Codes of Practice for Engineers and Managers can be subsequently developed through the establishment of National Hazards Committee to tackle latent errors that may arise with High Speed Two, Crossrail, and Network Rail Projects where the plan(s) for the implementation of new signalling technologies are proposed. In this way, the repeating the same mistakes over the last 171 years can be averted.
