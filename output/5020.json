"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Anonymous [PCC Progress 12]\nStaffordshire Police and Crime CommissionerThe questions asked in the public consultation were closed to the point of making the results completely worthless.  For example ‘Do you think it is important that crime is prevented?’ and ‘Do you think it is important to support victims of crime?’.  The exact wording was slightly different but I can no longer find these questions on the PCC website.\nWhen members of the public raised concerns about\n approaches such as the\n’\n Victim G\nateway’ no response \nh\na\ns been given to these concerns and they have only promoted the fact the 90 odd percent of people agreed that it is important to prevent crime\n or support victims not that the proposed approach is very flawed.\nThis \nhas been\n a\ndministered appallingly with £15,000 having been allocated\n to one group \n on the basis of a ‘chat’\n with Matthew Ellis\n prior to any other groups becoming \naware that there was funding available to be applied for.  Once it was available a whole application process was set in place with very short deadlines and little or no guidance\n provided.\n. \nThe guidance notes for the application basically explained the terms used and not actually what they could apply for or how much you could apply for etc.  Some groups were told they had applied for ‘too much’ but then when they had called to get guidance on this matter were told there was no limit and some groups who received money received substantially less than they originally requested and so the PCC clearly had the ability to offer a reduced amount of funding. \nEvents ha\nve been arranged by the PCC to discuss local matters with partners but so many groups did  not receive invites attendance has not been representative.  The Deputy PCC ran one such meeting regarding the ‘victim gateway’ idea and failed to \naccept or \nappreciate contributions from ag\nencies that have been working in\n the County for decades\n.\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
