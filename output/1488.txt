[[[&#xa0;]]]Weight Watchers welcomes the Communities and Local Government Committee’s inquiry into local government procurement, given local government’s new public health responsibilities.  Based on our extensive experience of the procurement and provision of publicly funded lifestyle weight management services for NHS patients, we hope the following points will be helpful to the Committee.&#xa0;&#xa0;Weight Watchers has concerns over future local government procurement of lifestyle weight management services. Over the last eight years we have encountered numerous examples of poor procurement practice related to the commissioning of publicly funded lifestyle weight management services for overweight and obese individuals. For example, many commissioners:&#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Do not understand the reality of weight management. It is a lifelong struggle for the obese, many of whom have a complex range of health, social and economic problems.  This struggle is not fully solved through time-limited interventions.  -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Lack knowledge of the scientific literature on the effectiveness of weight management services. They do not understand what the scientific evidence base indicates in terms of effectiveness. -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Do not use the evidence base to identify best potential providers-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Set unrealistic weight loss outcomes and contract KPIs-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Refuse to engage in pre-tender dialogue, which militates against flexibility and the capability of providers to tailor services to meet the specific needs of target groups.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Bundle services together for individuals with very different weight loss needs, for example seeking one provider to deliver a range of services for adults and children-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Do not ask for evidence of delivery from providers who over-promise to secure contracts&#xa0;In short, there is a lot wrong with the procurement processes connected to commissioning lifestyle weight management services.  Moving the responsibility for procurement of these services to local government provides an excellent opportunity to facilitate the real change required to make sure that people get the best possible service which delivers the best possible outcomes in the most cost effective way.  &#xa0;Whilst we have seen many examples of poor practices, there are also examples of high quality, person centred practices; commissioners, groups and working parties who seek to drive up the quality of procurement in lifestyle weight management services. Harnessing the expertise, knowledge and recommendations from these will be important. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]There is now good evidence that for overweight and obese people, referral to Weight Watchers is significantly more effective and costs the taxpayer less (Jolly et al, 2011; Jebb et al, 2011; Fuller et al, 2012) than the usual care that primary care in the NHS is able to provide.  Yet few commissioners seem to refer to this evidence and procure on this basis.  Services for individuals provided by NHS based health professionals often remain the preferred and more costly option.

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;Around 60% of adults are overweight and obese.  They need support to lose weight to prevent the massive burden of obesity linked conditions such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.  Providing lifestyle weight management services for these people makes good economic sense and to date, Primary Care Trusts have worked to make a range of services available for those with unhealthy weights.  However, there has been massive variation in the services patients can access through primary care, and the reality has been a postcode lottery.  The responsibility for public health and the procurement of lifestyle weight management services has now moved to local government.  These services will be funded through the £2.7 billion public health budget devolved (and theoretically ring-fenced) to local government.  However, anecdotal evidence from Weight Watchers’ public health contacts, who have moved from the NHS into local government, suggests that there has been a loss of skills, knowledge, experience and expertise in weight management services commissioning – and specifically lifestyle behavioural change interventions.  It remains unclear who will commission these vital services, at present it seems that local government are rationalising their procurement professionals; losing highly skilled public health commissioners in favour for more generic profiles that handle a wide portfolio.   &#xa0;There is a very real danger that the procurement of lifestyle weight management services will fall through the gap between local government and Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs). These services, that support people who are already overweight or obese, should be a fundamental part of a comprehensive healthy weight approach in local areas, one that spans prevention and clinical treatment. Early indications from our national view are that local government will largely focus on prevention measures and the NHS will only focus on complex and morbid obesity services that provide weight loss surgery. Behavioural change interventions for individuals, that support people to learn how to change their lifestyles, eating and activity to manage their weight, are at risk of being completely lost in this new procurement landscape. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;Weight Watchers is an example of an evidence-based programme which helps people lose weight and keep it off.  Yet most of the clinical and public health guidance linked to behavioural change weight control interventions seems to encourage commissioners to design, produce, pilot and refine new interventions rather than using those that are already tried and tested.  It takes huge resources and a lot of taxpayers’ money to develop a publicly funded weight management programme that works, is people-centred and achieves the best outcomes.  Surely in an environment where local government knows that it needs to meet huge cost and efficiency savings, one of the main ways it can do this is through procurement processes and specifically procuring ‘off the peg’ services which have a proven track record of effectiveness.  Re-inventing the wheel wastes money.&#xa0;&#xa0;In the absence of a national strategy on procurement of lifestyle weight management services, the organisations responsible for local government procurement should work collaboratively with providers to facilitate the real change required to shape local government procurement going forward. Local government procurement in the future needs to be mutually beneficial to all parties involved:  to local government with regard to value for money and meeting savings targets, and to suppliers in their ability to do more worthwhile business. Presently there is no evidence of such collaboration over weight management services.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]Despite NICE guidance recommending that ‘healthcare agencies should recommend to patients, or consider endorsing, self-help, commercial and community weight management programmes if they follow best practice’,  over the last eight years Weight Watchers has fought for acceptance as an effective referral route for overweight and obese NHS patients.    &#xa0;The previous Government’s obesity strategy, ‘Healthy Weight: Healthy Lives’, promoted partnerships as an essential element to solve the “obesity epidemic”.  Yet this rhetoric seldom became a reality.  In addition there was limited recognition of providers such as Weight Watchers within local obesity strategies or within local obesity care pathways drawn up by PCTs.  Historically Weight Watchers has encountered commercial prejudices (i.e. not being perceived as offering as high a quality service as NHS providers) within NHS commissioning circles where protectionism of public sector providers is often rife.  It is hoped that now local government is responsible for procurement of these services, there will be a sea change in attitudes to providers who have good quality data underpinning the effectiveness of the services they offer and who meet NICE best practice standards. &#xa0;&#xa0;Weight Watchers applauds the overall emphasis in the Health and Social Care Bill that it will be outcomes that matter, not targets or activity alone, with government pledging an end to the production line approach to delivering services.  As such, providers will be paid according to their performance.  However, this principle needs careful application to weight management services.  Helping people lose weight is complex, often requiring behavioural intervention, backed up by regular and lifelong support and review.  Losing weight requires great effort and patients often describe the weight loss journey as ‘an endless battle’ (DH 2010).  Research suggests that high relapse and dropout rates are common in weight loss treatment studies – ranging from 10 – 80% (Inelman et al, 2005). For example, in the Counterweight study where weight management interventions were mediated by practice nurses (2004) retention was 22.5% at 12 months.  There is a danger that if payment by results is insensitively applied to weight management service providers, then only people with lower BMIs (25 – 30 kg/m²) and less complex health and socioeconomic needs will be accepted as eligible by commissioners and this will cause inequalities of access.  Insensitive payment by results KPIs in the weight management arena could discriminate against larger people with complex health problems. The solution is to set realistic KPIs specific to different types of weight management interventions, informed by the evidence-base of what’s healthy and what’s possible (e.g. drug treatments, group support, one to one with a practice nurse, very low calorie diets). These very specific KPIs should be grounded in what the research indicates is achievable and should form the basis for any ‘payment by results’ scheme. It is unfortunate but discussions that we have had with commissioners so far regarding this issue have indicated that their desired results are certainly not based on the evidence of what is achievable for a specific intervention, often seeming being ‘plucked out of the air’. &#xa0;&#xa0;Weight Watchers has provided a consistent voice on the significant policy and strategy changes brought about by the Health and Social Care Act 2012.  It is the only commercial weight management provider on the Government’s expert ‘National Ambition Review Group for Obesity’.  It has been invited to give evidence to numerous parliamentary inquiries and been an active member of the Department of Health’s obesity commissioning task force, which issued best practice guidance on commissioning tier 2 lifestyle weight management services in May 2013 (DH, 2013).  This guidance sets out a template specification for such services and realistic outcomes for interventions.  It should be the reference point for local government procurement of lifestyle weight management services.&#xa0;Over the last eight years Weight Watchers has developed its healthcare services. It:&#xa0;Over the last decade Weight Watchers has made significant investment in research to evaluate the efficacy of its methods, and the effectiveness of its Referral Scheme.  A recently completed randomised controlled trial (Jebb et al 2011) conducted across 3 countries (England, Germany and Australia) revealed that patients referred to Weight Watchers lost significantly more weight (-4.02kg) at one year compared to those who received standard care within primary care (-1.59kg). Of those who completed, patients referred to Weight Watchers lost significantly more weight (-6.87kg) at one year compared to those who received standard care within primary care (-3.17kg). 61% of Weight Watchers patients vs. 32% of standard care patients lost ≥ 5% baseline weight. Dropout rates were also higher in the primary care group (50%) compared to the Weight Watchers group (41%). This independent research shows that when healthcare agencies and the independent sector work in collaboration, changes in health behaviours that result in weight loss outcomes can be significant.&#xa0;In 2009 Weight Watchers commissioned the independent Foresight team to project the economic consequences of larger scale referral to Weight Watchers.  The authors calculated that if just 4% of the adult population (bearing in mind that currently 60% are overweight or obese, this is an extremely conservative analysis) were referred for a 12 session course of Weight Watchers and this resulted in an average BMI drop of 1.5 units (which is what is generally achieved if people complete the course), then this, if maintained over their lifetime, would result in direct healthcare cost savings of  £1,860 per person, and society saving £9 billion up to 2080 (Brown and McPherson, 2009).&#xa0;To support weight maintenance, once any Weight Watchers member reaches a healthy weight, they can attend Weight Watchers meetings free of charge for the rest of their lives. If the member came to Weight Watchers via a local government, public health procured scheme they would be entitled to the same lifetime support – at zero cost to the public purse. &#xa0;
