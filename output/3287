default              
defaultThe Royal Consent is exercised 
defaultautomatically 
defaulton the advice of ministers.
default  
default&#xa0;
default04
default              
defaultCurrent practice is that the Private Secretary of the Bill's sponsoring Minister sends a letter to the Private Secreta
defaultry of 
defaultthe Queen or Prince of Wales as 
defaultappropriate
default setting out how the prerogative or

defaultUnder Cabinet Office guidelines, c
defaultopies of this letter 
defaultare sent to the Queen's solicitors, Messrs Farrer &amp; Co. in Lincoln's Inn, who advise the Royal Household

defaultthe implications of relevant Bills

defaultThe legal authority for the Royal Consentdefault&#xa0;
default07
default              
defaultThe legal 
defaultauthority for the 
defaultrequirement for
default Royal Consent 
defaultis simply parliamentary usage existing since time immemorial.  It is part of "
defaultt
defaulthe law and custom of Parliament", not common law or statute.
default  This means 
defaultthat 
defaultit is within the power of 
defaulteach House to determine
default the existence and 
defaultprocess of the Royal Consent.  
default&#xa0;
default08
default              
defaultThis
default legal fact 
defaultis 
defaultcommonly misunderstood 
defaultor 
defaulttends to be 
defaultobscured 
defaultbecause the bulk of the communications involved are carried out by
default 
defaultor for Ministers of the Crown and the Royal Household.  No doubt 
defaultgovernment and 
defaultroyal officials may feel some 
defaultsense of
default ownership of the whole process, 
defaultbeca
defaultuse 
defaultit is 
defaultthey
default who are doing much of the work
default and 
defaultit is a
default Privy Counsellor who communicates the 
defaultRoyal 
defaultConsent to Parliament. 
default&#xa0;
default09
default              
defaultWhether
default or not the content of a Bill does in fact affect the royal prerogative or the property interests of the Crown or Duchies of Lancaster or Cornwall is a matter for the ultimate judgement of the House authorities in Parliament, meaning in practice the Public
default Bill offices in the Commons and Lords acting in collaboration.
default&#xa0;
default10
default              
defaultSimilar 
defaultprocess
defaultes
default 
defaultfor Royal Consent 
defaultoperate
default in the legislative proceedings
default of the Scottish Parliament an
defaultd National Assembly for Wales. In each case this operates 
defaultunder the authority of st
defaultanding orders required by the
default 
defaultScotland A
defaultct 1998 and Government of Wales Act 2006
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultArguments for and against repealdefault&#xa0;
default11
default              
defaultThe 
defaultcase for maintaining the Royal Consent is simply ceremonial, forming part of the public theatre surround
defaulting the monarchy today, enjoyed by many.  It is part of the 
defaultwide-ranging 
defaultconventional courtesies 
defaultowed to the Queen and Prince of Wales, supporting their dignity an
defaultd national memories of the 
defaulthistorical traditions of monarchy from centuries past when they pr
defaultesided over the operation of the state in all its forms, executive, legislative, and judicial.
default  Politically, the Royal Consent could be viewed as a harmless anachronism.
default&#xa0;
default12
default              
defaultHowever, there are negative aspects to the Royal Consent.  Firstly
default, there is an apparent 
defaultconflict of interest in the Que
defaulten and 
defaultPrinc
defaulte of Wales being involved in legislative 
defaultdecision
defaults
default affecting the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall respectively, since they derive benef
defaultits from these Crown properties.
default  
defaultThis is not to sugge
defaults
defaultt that in 
defaultreality
default they 
defaultever do seek to influence or block 
defaultany such 
defaultlegislative measures
default, 
defaultbut the fact that the present situation provides the opportunity for them to 
defaultdo so
default creates the public appearance of
default bias in the law-making process and feeds criticism
default 
defaultof 
defaultthe monarchy 
defaultand cynicism about its neutrality 
defaultin our public life.
default&#xa0;
default13
default              
defaultSecondly, there is a cost factor in
default maintaining this system of Royal Consent.  It is difficult to qu
defaultantify this in terms of time taken or financial calculation of the support services provided, 
defaultbut it involves 
defaultan 
defaultextensive reading of documentation and letter writing by officials in the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, 
defaultthe Clerks of Legislation in both Ho
defaultuses of Parliament, the Queen's Private Secretary at 
defaultBuckingham Palace, and 
defaultliaison with 
defaultthe Queen's Solicitors
default,
default 
defaultMessrs 
defaultFarrer
default &amp; Co.
default 
default&#xa0;
default14
default              
defaultThirdly, the
default requirement for Royal Consent 
defaultis a procedure that can be manipulated by the government to sabotage a Pri
defaultvate Members' Bill of which is disapproves.
default  
defaultA
default government is perfectly capable of killing off any legislative proposal of which it disapproves, by 
defaultusing its majority to vote down the measure at second reading, or more likely by depriving it of the necessa
defaultry parliamentary time to make progress.  
defaultBut to use the Royal Consent as a procedural device for this end, perhaps to circumvent gover
defaultnment intra-party dissent that m
defaultight
default embarrass ministers
default, could be seen as an unconstitutional misuse of process.
default  
default&#xa0;
default15
default              
defaultThere is also an inherent danger that a misguided future Monarch or Prince of Wales holding strong moral views on the subject-matter of a Bill 
defaultcovered by the Royal Consent procedure 
defaultmight believe he 
defaultor she 
defaultis entitled to imp
defaultose his opinion on 
defaultthe matter.  
defaultNo one imagines the Queen would intervene in this way, but constitutional arrangements governing hereditary public offices should provide for whatever types of personality might succeed by accident of birth. 
default&#xa0;
defaultRoyal Consent and Royal Assent contrasteddefault&#xa0;
default16
default              
defaultIt is instructive to compare 
defaultand contrast the Royal Consent
default taking place 
defaultduring the legislative process
default with the Royal Assent
default taking place 
defaultafter the Bill has completed all 
defaultits parliamentary
default stages
default.  The Royal Assent 
defaultas a requirement before a Bill becomes law 
defaultis a 
defaultcommon law prerogative 
defaultpower, 
defaultand its 
defaultpersonal exercise
default 
defaultis 
defaultunchallengeable 
defaultjudicially or otherwise
default.  
defaultIt is therefore a formidable legal power in the hands of the Monarch personally.  However, as it well known
default,
default there has been no withholding of such Assent (otherwise known as a Royal Veto) since 1707 when Queen Anne refus
defaulted the Scotch Militia Bill.  In 
defaultpractice, this power has become obsolete, and its exercise today would be tantamount to a rejection o
defaultf parliame
defaultntary authority
default, to
defaultgether with the government, and would almost certainly 
defaultprecipitate a forced abdication and/or the monarchy'
defaults replacement by a presidency.  
default&#xa0;
default17
default              
defaultBy co
defaultntrast 
defaultthe Royal Consent has no common law or statutory basis,
default and is essentially a mat
defaultter of parliamentary custom
default.  But despite its
default minimal 
defaultstatus as law
default,
default it carries potentially much greater political significance than Royal Assent.  This is because it provid
defaultes the Monarch
default and Prince of Wales 
defaultwith advance notice of what is being proposed
default by the government
default, and therefore 
defaultthe opportunity to 
defaultexpress an 
defaultopinion 
defaulton the matter 
defaultand 
defaultexert 
defaultpressure on the g
defaultovernment in the event that he or she 
defaultdisagrees.  
defaultEven though the Queen's and Prince's spokesmen have rebutted 
defaultpress speculation 
defaultthat any such 
defaultpressure has been brought in the past,
default the 
defaultexistence of the Consent procedure is 
defaultbound to continue arousing 
defaultunwelcome suspicions 
defaultof Prince Charles' involvement in matters of public policy and government affairs.
default&#xa0;
defaultKeeping the Queen and Prince informeddefault&#xa0;
default18
default              
defaultIt is a principle of natural justice and good governance that 
defaultbodies 
defaultaffected, or likely to be affected,
default by government legislative proposals should be consulted and given the opportunity to express opinions.  There is nothing objectionable per se about the Queen or the Prince being consulted on matters affecting the 
defaultinterests of the 
defaultCrown and 
defaultroyal family, a
defaultnd indeed ministers should welcome their views.  
default&#xa0;
default19
default              
defaultHowever
default the 
defaultprivileged and formal process of
default Royal Consent 
defaultforming an essential element in parliamentary proceedings 
defaultis 
defaultunnecessary for this. 
defaultThere 
defaultare already national pro
defaultcesses of public consultation
default 
defaultwhere property matters affecting the public at large, including the royal Duchies, are concerned
default.  It 
defaultmight be 
defaultcourteous for a government department to give the Queen's o
defaultr Prince's offices notice of 
defaultpending 
defaultpolicy decision
defaults
default that significantly affected the 
defaultCrown estates or 
defaultthe royal 
defaultDuchies, but 
defaultthis does not justify what is effectively a scrutiny reserve and power of veto over parliamentary proceedings on a Bill.  
defaultAnd o
defaultn 
defaultmatters of 
defaultstate where the prerogative might be concerned,
default it is 
defaultalready 
defaultgenerally acce
defaultpted that the royal Head of State 
default"has, under a constitutional monarchy as ours, three rights - the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn"
default,
default and 
defaulta 
defaultdialogue of this kind 
defaulttake
defaults place 
defaultevery week 
defaultat the Queen's 
defaultprime ministerial 
defaultmeetings.  
default&#xa0;
defaultConclusion: implementing the changedefault&#xa0;
default20
default              
defaultIf agreement were reached that the 
defaultRoyal Consent should be abolished
default, then so far as the UK Parliament is concerned, 
defaultbecause the existing 
defaultrequirement is
default founded on parliamentary usage, not common law or statute, 
defaultremoval of the need for Consent
default could be implemented
default by a simple motio
defaultn 
defaultput and resolution passed 
defaultto this effect in each House
default of Parliament.  
default&#xa0;
default21
default              
defaultThe statutory provisions and standing orders pro
defaultviding for the Royal Consent in the legislative proceedings of the Scottish Parliament and National Assembly of Wales are expressed to apply to "
defaulta Bill containing provisions which would, if the Bill were a Bill for an Act of
default Parliament, require" such Conse
defaultnt.  The effect of this is that were the UK Parliament to remove the requirement for Royal Consent, the similar requirements in these two devolved legislatures would lapse.

defaultIn this memora
defaultndum, the Queen's and/or Prince of Wale
defaults
default'
default Consent to legislation is referred to as the 
defaultRoyal Consent.
default 
defaultThe need for the Prince of Wales' consent is 
defaultlimited to provisions af
defaultfecting the Duchy of Cornwall of which he is Duke, his role as Prince and Steward of Scotland, and matters arising that affect his titles or interaction with the Royal Household: see Office of Parliamentary Counsel, 
defaultQueen's or Princ
defaulte's Consent
default, 2012, chapter 3.
default  This is endorsed by recent public statements: 
default"It is a long established convention that the Queen is asked by Parliament to provide consent to those Bills which Parliament has decided would affect Crown interests. The Sover
defaulteign has not refused consent
default to any Bill affecting Crown interests unless advised to do so by ministers" (Buckingham Palace spokesman); "In modern times, the Prince of Wales has never refused to consent to any Bill affecting Duchy of Cornwall interests, un
defaultless advised to do so by ministers.  Every instance of the Prince's consent having been sought and given to legislation is a matter of public record" (Clarence House spokesman): quoted in the 
defaultGuardian
default, 15 January 2013.

default Queen's and Prince's consent published by the Cabinet Office:

default (Office of Parliamentary Counsel, 2012).
default 
defaultIt is unclear who underwrites the legal fees charged for the involvement of this pr
defaultivate firm of Solicitors.
default 
defaultIn current practice, this is normally at Third Reading in the House of Commons, and at Second Reading in the House of Lords.  Although in practice it is usually the minister who announces the Royal Consent, any Member of the Commons or Peer in the Lords ma
defaulty communicate the Royal Consent so long as they are a member of the Privy Council.

default.
default 
defaultThis legal 
defaultfact is recognised by the senior legal adviser in the process, the office of Parliamentary Counsel, whose guidance states, "The decision on whether consent is required
default is for the House authorities" (p.1, para. 1.3) and "The issue of consent is entirely a m

default 
defaultProcedurally such backbench Bills can be introduced on a motion without first going through Royal Consent though subsequently they need normal approval to progress: an example of this where Consent was refused was 
defaultthe Military Actions Against I
defaultraq Bill, 1998-99, 
defaultCommons Hansard
default, 26 January 1999, cols. 145-147 (Tam Dalyell).
default An apparent example of this was the withholding the Royal Consent to the
