[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Written evidence from Professor [bold]R[bold]obert[bold] B[bold]lackburn[bold](QPC 10)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Summary[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The Royal C
[normal]onsent
[normal] procedures currently operating in the legislative process have become an anachronism today and redundant of any practical 
[normal]public 
[normal]purpose beyond royal ceremony. 
[normal]Over time a number of negative attributes associated with the procedures have arisen, am
[normal]ong them time and cost factors for officials and legal advisers, and press speculation 
[normal]over unjustified royal interven
[normal]tion in the legislative process. 
[normal]It is in everyone
[normal]'s interests that the Royal C
[normal]onsent pr
[normal]ocedures are withdrawn.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The [bold]rules and procedures[bold] of the Royal Consent[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]0
[normal]1
[normal]              
[normal]The consent of the Queen 
[normal]or the Pri
[normal]nce of Wales where applicable
[normal] 
[normal]must be 
[normal]sought, granted and communicated to both Houses of Parliament, 
[normal]whenever a matter tou
[normal]ching on the royal prerogative or 
[normal]Crow
[normal]n property 
[normal]is affected, most 
[normal]notab
[normal]ly the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]0
[normal]2
[normal]              
[normal]The substance of the 
[normal]Royal Consent 
[normal]is 
[normal]an 
[normal]agreement to the proposed legislation being considered and debated in each House of 
[normal]Parliament, not that the Queen 
[normal]or 
[normal]the 
[normal]Prince of Wales
[normal]'s
[normal] where applicable 
[normal]necessarily 
[normal]agrees or supports the content of the meas
[normal]ure itself.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]0
[normal]3
[normal]              
[normal]The Royal Consent is exercised 
[normal]automatically 
[normal]on the advice of ministers.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]04
[normal]              
[normal]Current practice is that the Private Secretary of the Bill's sponsoring Minister sends a letter to the Private Secreta
[normal]ry of 
[normal]the Queen or Prince of Wales as 
[normal]appropriate
[normal] setting out how the prerogative or 
[normal]their property interests
[normal] would be affected, together 
[normal]with copies of the Bill.
[normal]  
[normal]In the preparation of this 
[normal]letter
[normal] the advice of Parliamentary Counsel 
[normal]is taken
[normal] 
[normal]who in turn 
[normal]takes advice from
[normal] the 
[normal]Public Bill offices in the House of Commons and House of Lords.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]05
[normal]              
[normal]Under Cabinet Office guidelines, c
[normal]opies of this letter 
[normal]are sent to the Queen's solicitors, Messrs Farrer &amp; Co. in Lincoln's Inn, who advise the Royal Household
[normal], the C
[normal]lerk to the Council of the Duchy of Lancaster and the Secretary to the Duchy of Cornwall on 
[normal]the implications of relevant Bills
[normal] affecting 
[normal]royal interests.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]06
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]Royal 
[normal]Consent is 
[normal]then 
[normal]communicated
[normal] 
[normal]back 
[normal]to the sponsori
[normal]ng department by letter, and 
[normal]is communicated onwards 
[normal]to 
[normal]the Commons and Lords
[normal] b
[normal]y 
[normal]a minister in each House respectively 
[normal]who 
[normal]is 
[normal]also 
[normal]a member
[normal] of 
[normal]the 
[normal]Privy Council at an appropriate stage of the Bill.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The legal authority for the Royal Consent[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]07
[normal]              
[normal]The legal 
[normal]authority for the 
[normal]requirement for
[normal] Royal Consent 
[normal]is simply parliamentary usage existing since time immemorial.  It is part of "
[normal]t
[normal]he law and custom of Parliament", not common law or statute.
[normal]  This means 
[normal]that 
[normal]it is within the power of 
[normal]each House to determine
[normal] the existence and 
[normal]process of the Royal Consent.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]08
[normal]              
[normal]This
[normal] legal fact 
[normal]is 
[normal]commonly misunderstood 
[normal]or 
[normal]tends to be 
[normal]obscured 
[normal]because the bulk of the communications involved are carried out by
[normal] 
[normal]or for Ministers of the Crown and the Royal Household.  No doubt 
[normal]government and 
[normal]royal officials may feel some 
[normal]sense of
[normal] ownership of the whole process, 
[normal]beca
[normal]use 
[normal]it is 
[normal]they
[normal] who are doing much of the work
[normal] and 
[normal]it is a
[normal] Privy Counsellor who communicates the 
[normal]Royal 
[normal]Consent to Parliament. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]09
[normal]              
[normal]Whether
[normal] or not the content of a Bill does in fact affect the royal prerogative or the property interests of the Crown or Duchies of Lancaster or Cornwall is a matter for the ultimate judgement of the House authorities in Parliament, meaning in practice the Public
[normal] Bill offices in the Commons and Lords acting in collaboration.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10
[normal]              
[normal]Similar 
[normal]process
[normal]es
[normal] 
[normal]for Royal Consent 
[normal]operate
[normal] in the legislative proceedings
[normal] of the Scottish Parliament an
[normal]d National Assembly for Wales. In each case this operates 
[normal]under the authority of st
[normal]anding orders required by the
[normal] 
[normal]Scotland A
[normal]ct 1998 and Government of Wales Act 2006
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Arguments for and against repeal[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]11
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]case for maintaining the Royal Consent is simply ceremonial, forming part of the public theatre surround
[normal]ing the monarchy today, enjoyed by many.  It is part of the 
[normal]wide-ranging 
[normal]conventional courtesies 
[normal]owed to the Queen and Prince of Wales, supporting their dignity an
[normal]d national memories of the 
[normal]historical traditions of monarchy from centuries past when they pr
[normal]esided over the operation of the state in all its forms, executive, legislative, and judicial.
[normal]  Politically, the Royal Consent could be viewed as a harmless anachronism.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12
[normal]              
[normal]However, there are negative aspects to the Royal Consent.  Firstly
[normal], there is an apparent 
[normal]conflict of interest in the Que
[normal]en and 
[normal]Princ
[normal]e of Wales being involved in legislative 
[normal]decision
[normal]s
[normal] affecting the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall respectively, since they derive benef
[normal]its from these Crown properties.
[normal]  
[normal]This is not to sugge
[normal]s
[normal]t that in 
[normal]reality
[normal] they 
[normal]ever do seek to influence or block 
[normal]any such 
[normal]legislative measures
[normal], 
[normal]but the fact that the present situation provides the opportunity for them to 
[normal]do so
[normal] creates the public appearance of
[normal] bias in the law-making process and feeds criticism
[normal] 
[normal]of 
[normal]the monarchy 
[normal]and cynicism about its neutrality 
[normal]in our public life.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13
[normal]              
[normal]Secondly, there is a cost factor in
[normal] maintaining this system of Royal Consent.  It is difficult to qu
[normal]antify this in terms of time taken or financial calculation of the support services provided, 
[normal]but it involves 
[normal]an 
[normal]extensive reading of documentation and letter writing by officials in the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, 
[normal]the Clerks of Legislation in both Ho
[normal]uses of Parliament, the Queen's Private Secretary at 
[normal]Buckingham Palace, and 
[normal]liaison with 
[normal]the Queen's Solicitors
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]Messrs 
[normal]Farrer
[normal] &amp; Co.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14
[normal]              
[normal]Thirdly, the
[normal] requirement for Royal Consent 
[normal]is a procedure that can be manipulated by the government to sabotage a Pri
[normal]vate Members' Bill of which is disapproves.
[normal]  
[normal]A
[normal] government is perfectly capable of killing off any legislative proposal of which it disapproves, by 
[normal]using its majority to vote down the measure at second reading, or more likely by depriving it of the necessa
[normal]ry parliamentary time to make progress.  
[normal]But to use the Royal Consent as a procedural device for this end, perhaps to circumvent gover
[normal]nment intra-party dissent that m
[normal]ight
[normal] embarrass ministers
[normal], could be seen as an unconstitutional misuse of process.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15
[normal]              
[normal]There is also an inherent danger that a misguided future Monarch or Prince of Wales holding strong moral views on the subject-matter of a Bill 
[normal]covered by the Royal Consent procedure 
[normal]might believe he 
[normal]or she 
[normal]is entitled to imp
[normal]ose his opinion on 
[normal]the matter.  
[normal]No one imagines the Queen would intervene in this way, but constitutional arrangements governing hereditary public offices should provide for whatever types of personality might succeed by accident of birth. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Royal Consent and Royal Assent contrasted[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]16
[normal]              
[normal]It is instructive to compare 
[normal]and contrast the Royal Consent
[normal] taking place 
[normal]during the legislative process
[normal] with the Royal Assent
[normal] taking place 
[normal]after the Bill has completed all 
[normal]its parliamentary
[normal] stages
[normal].  The Royal Assent 
[normal]as a requirement before a Bill becomes law 
[normal]is a 
[normal]common law prerogative 
[normal]power, 
[normal]and its 
[normal]personal exercise
[normal] 
[normal]is 
[normal]unchallengeable 
[normal]judicially or otherwise
[normal].  
[normal]It is therefore a formidable legal power in the hands of the Monarch personally.  However, as it well known
[normal],
[normal] there has been no withholding of such Assent (otherwise known as a Royal Veto) since 1707 when Queen Anne refus
[normal]ed the Scotch Militia Bill.  In 
[normal]practice, this power has become obsolete, and its exercise today would be tantamount to a rejection o
[normal]f parliame
[normal]ntary authority
[normal], to
[normal]gether with the government, and would almost certainly 
[normal]precipitate a forced abdication and/or the monarchy'
[normal]s replacement by a presidency.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17
[normal]              
[normal]By co
[normal]ntrast 
[normal]the Royal Consent has no common law or statutory basis,
[normal] and is essentially a mat
[normal]ter of parliamentary custom
[normal].  But despite its
[normal] minimal 
[normal]status as law
[normal],
[normal] it carries potentially much greater political significance than Royal Assent.  This is because it provid
[normal]es the Monarch
[normal] and Prince of Wales 
[normal]with advance notice of what is being proposed
[normal] by the government
[normal], and therefore 
[normal]the opportunity to 
[normal]express an 
[normal]opinion 
[normal]on the matter 
[normal]and 
[normal]exert 
[normal]pressure on the g
[normal]overnment in the event that he or she 
[normal]disagrees.  
[normal]Even though the Queen's and Prince's spokesmen have rebutted 
[normal]press speculation 
[normal]that any such 
[normal]pressure has been brought in the past,
[normal] the 
[normal]existence of the Consent procedure is 
[normal]bound to continue arousing 
[normal]unwelcome suspicions 
[normal]of Prince Charles' involvement in matters of public policy and government affairs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Keeping the Queen and Prince informed[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]18
[normal]              
[normal]It is a principle of natural justice and good governance that 
[normal]bodies 
[normal]affected, or likely to be affected,
[normal] by government legislative proposals should be consulted and given the opportunity to express opinions.  There is nothing objectionable per se about the Queen or the Prince being consulted on matters affecting the 
[normal]interests of the 
[normal]Crown and 
[normal]royal family, a
[normal]nd indeed ministers should welcome their views.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]19
[normal]              
[normal]However
[normal] the 
[normal]privileged and formal process of
[normal] Royal Consent 
[normal]forming an essential element in parliamentary proceedings 
[normal]is 
[normal]unnecessary for this. 
[normal]There 
[normal]are already national pro
[normal]cesses of public consultation
[normal] 
[normal]where property matters affecting the public at large, including the royal Duchies, are concerned
[normal].  It 
[normal]might be 
[normal]courteous for a government department to give the Queen's o
[normal]r Prince's offices notice of 
[normal]pending 
[normal]policy decision
[normal]s
[normal] that significantly affected the 
[normal]Crown estates or 
[normal]the royal 
[normal]Duchies, but 
[normal]this does not justify what is effectively a scrutiny reserve and power of veto over parliamentary proceedings on a Bill.  
[normal]And o
[normal]n 
[normal]matters of 
[normal]state where the prerogative might be concerned,
[normal] it is 
[normal]already 
[normal]generally acce
[normal]pted that the royal Head of State 
[normal]"has, under a constitutional monarchy as ours, three rights - the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn"
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]a 
[normal]dialogue of this kind 
[normal]take
[normal]s place 
[normal]every week 
[normal]at the Queen's 
[normal]prime ministerial 
[normal]meetings.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Conclusion: implementing the change[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]20
[normal]              
[normal]If agreement were reached that the 
[normal]Royal Consent should be abolished
[normal], then so far as the UK Parliament is concerned, 
[normal]because the existing 
[normal]requirement is
[normal] founded on parliamentary usage, not common law or statute, 
[normal]removal of the need for Consent
[normal] could be implemented
[normal] by a simple motio
[normal]n 
[normal]put and resolution passed 
[normal]to this effect in each House
[normal] of Parliament.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]21
[normal]              
[normal]The statutory provisions and standing orders pro
[normal]viding for the Royal Consent in the legislative proceedings of the Scottish Parliament and National Assembly of Wales are expressed to apply to "
[normal]a Bill containing provisions which would, if the Bill were a Bill for an Act of
[normal] Parliament, require" such Conse
[normal]nt.  The effect of this is that were the UK Parliament to remove the requirement for Royal Consent, the similar requirements in these two devolved legislatures would lapse.

[normal]In this memora
[normal]ndum, the Queen's and/or Prince of Wale
[normal]s
[normal]'
[normal] Consent to legislation is referred to as the 
[normal]Royal Consent.
[normal] 
[normal]The need for the Prince of Wales' consent is 
[normal]limited to provisions af
[normal]fecting the Duchy of Cornwall of which he is Duke, his role as Prince and Steward of Scotland, and matters arising that affect his titles or interaction with the Royal Household: see Office of Parliamentary Counsel, 
[normal]Queen's or Princ
[normal]e's Consent
[normal], 2012, chapter 3.
[normal]  This is endorsed by recent public statements: 
[normal]"It is a long established convention that the Queen is asked by Parliament to provide consent to those Bills which Parliament has decided would affect Crown interests. The Sover
[normal]eign has not refused consent
[normal] to any Bill affecting Crown interests unless advised to do so by ministers" (Buckingham Palace spokesman); "In modern times, the Prince of Wales has never refused to consent to any Bill affecting Duchy of Cornwall interests, un
[normal]less advised to do so by ministers.  Every instance of the Prince's consent having been sought and given to legislation is a matter of public record" (Clarence House spokesman): quoted in the 
[normal]Guardian
[normal], 15 January 2013.
[normal] 
[normal]Generally see the guidelines on the
[normal] Queen's and Prince's consent published by the Cabinet Office: 
[normal]Guide to Making Legislation
[normal] (2013) and 
[normal]Queen's or Prince's Consent
[normal] (Office of Parliamentary Counsel, 2012).
[normal] 
[normal]It is unclear who underwrites the legal fees charged for the involvement of this pr
[normal]ivate firm of Solicitors.
[normal] 
[normal]In current practice, this is normally at Third Reading in the House of Commons, and at Second Reading in the House of Lords.  Although in practice it is usually the minister who announces the Royal Consent, any Member of the Commons or Peer in the Lords ma
[normal]y communicate the Royal Consent so long as they are a member of the Privy Council.
[normal] 
[normal]On the nature of parliamentary p
[normal]rocedure, see Robert Blackburn &amp;
[normal] Andrew Kennon, 
[normal]Parliament: Functions, Practice &amp; Procedures
[normal] (2nd ed., 2003), pp. 247-253
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]This legal 
[normal]fact is recognised by the senior legal adviser in the process, the office of Parliamentary Counsel, whose guidance states, "The decision on whether consent is required
[normal] is for the House authorities" (p.1, para. 1.3) and "The issue of consent is entirely a m
[normal]atter of House procedure" (p.17).
[normal] 
[normal]Section 22, paragraph 7 of s
[normal]chedule 3 of the 
[normal]Scotland Act 1998 and section 111(4) of t
[normal]he Government of Wales Act 2006.
[normal] 
[normal]It is unclear who underwrites the legal fees charged for the involvement of this private firm of So
[normal]licitors.
[normal] 
[normal]Procedurally such backbench Bills can be introduced on a motion without first going through Royal Consent though subsequently they need normal approval to progress: an example of this where Consent was refused was 
[normal]the Military Actions Against I
[normal]raq Bill, 1998-99, 
[normal]Commons Hansard
[normal], 26 January 1999, cols. 145-147 (Tam Dalyell).
[normal] An apparent example of this was the withholding the Royal Consent to the 
[normal]Military Actions Against Iraq Bill, 1998-99, 
[normal]Commons Hansard
[normal], 26 January 1999, cols. 145-147, prese
[normal]nted by Tam Dalyell.
