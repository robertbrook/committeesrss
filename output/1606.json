"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Mike Mason (HOT27)Abstract\nThis paper focuses solely on domestic heating.  \nIt \nshows\n that in order to meet the obligations of the Climate Change Act, and also the policy objectives for aviation by 2050, the UK’s domestic heating has to be completely decarbonised.  This can either be done by electricity, or perhaps using new technologies to synthesise methane\n or hydrogen\n using spare summer electricity.\n  No other renewable resources, such as biomass or biogas, can make other than marginal contributions.\nThe fundamental problems are twofold – generating the required energy, and meeting the peak power demands.  \nThe solutions dwarf\n the challenge of decarbonising the existing electricity grid.  \nBoth of these problems are essentially intractable with current technology\n.\nThe problems can be alleviated by the extensive, and expensive, use of insulation and heat pumps – no other current technology will make other than a very marginal contribution.  However even the most optimistic assessment of the potential savings leaves a new carbon free power requirement that is greater than the entire current generating capacity of the UK.  European connection is unlikely to help.\nThere are ways to approach the solution, but they involve intense, well funded, research programs that consider the entire energy system as a whole unit – from power source to house\n thermostat\n.  The market alone cannot deliver the degree of \ncohenernce\n needed – it will require substantial Government involvement and support.\nThere are also policy measures which could be implemented quickly and cheaply that would be more effective than the existing RHI and Green Deal in the domestic sector, and would help accelerate substantially the decarbonisation of heat.\n&#xa0;\nLow estimate\nHigh estimate\nLoft Insulation (270mm)\n£200\n£700\nSolid Wall insulation\n£5,500\n£13,000\nDouble Glazing\n£3,300\n£6,500\nTOTAL£9,000£20,200&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n UK GHG emissions in 1990 were about 766 million tonnes CO\n2\n(e).  The UK population in 2050 is expected to be 78 million.  1.8 tonnes per person reflects a national emission limit of 140 million tonnes CO\n2\n(e), or 18% of 1990 emissions.\n Note the difference between CO\n2\n emissions and CO\n2\n(e) or CO\n2\n equivalent emissions.\n A\ndding 37.5 million tonnes \nnon-\nCO\n2\n emissions from aviation to the accounts increases the baseline GHG emissions in 1990 by 37.5Mt, and also increases the allowance in 2050 - \nby 2\n0% of 37.5 or 7.5 Mt\n a year.\n  However because these 37.5 Mt of emissions will continue through 2050, the emissions from sectors other than aviation must be reduced by an extra 30 Mt (37.5-7.5).\n \nhttp://www.decc.gov.uk/assets/decc/11/stats/publications/dukes/5959-dukes-2012-annex-a.pdf\n .  2010 data show domestic energy consumption for all fuels except electricity and bio-energy of 37.7 million tonnes of oil equivalent – at 42GJ/TOE.\n \nhttp://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/Using-this-site/Our-calculations\n \n Cavity wall insulation is ignored in this assessment as it makes savings that are insufficient to achieve anything close to the requirements – all houses will have to have additional insulation.\n \nSee \nwww.myretrofit.blogspot.com\n \n"
