"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence\n from Andrew McCloy TIC 094)\n&#xa0;\n1\n              \nIntroduction\n –\n Andrew McCloy\n&#xa0;\nFrom 2009-13 I was the Business Development Manager for Bakewell &amp; Eyam Community Transport \n(BECT) in Derbyshire, a post funded through the Rur\nal Social Enterprise Programme\n. The aim of this DfT-\nsupport\ned project was to help \nrural C\nommunity \nT\nransport operators adopt a more enterprise-led approach, win more contracts and generate more income. Sinc\ne leaving BECT I have undertaken some consultancy work for the Community Transport Association\n. I am a parish councillor \nand an elected Parish \nM\nember on the Peak District National Park Authority. I also write walking guidebooks and run a website promoting \ncycling in the Peak District. The following submission is from mysel\nf as an individual and not on behalf of any organisation.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2\n              \nSummary\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3\n              \nBus transport in rural areas\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;To what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?&#xa0;\n3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFrom my experience of rural Derbyshire and in particular the villages of the Peak District (not the valley \narteries\n connecting the towns), publicly subsidised service buses are routinely running round \nempty\n \nor near empty \nin the middle of the day. \nThis is even the case at weekends, when visitors and recreational users should be using them. It is a ludicrous situ\nation that points to a funda\nmental lack of understanding of their customers’ needs \nin terms of \nwhere \nthey \nactually want to go and when\n. It also suggests\n a lack of political will to explore new and imaginative solutions for rural public transport delivery.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe problem is being compounded by the local authority (as elsewhere) cutting back services, in particular those deemed fringe or unprofitable \nthat hit the vulnerable users even harder. In my own village the late evening bus back from Bakewell has been a\nxed so that the teenagers now have to rely on lifts or taxis and have stopped using the bus for even the \nearlier \noutward journey. We are in danger of developing a rural generation for whom bus transport is an altogether alien concept!\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nQuite apart from pro\nvision, the marketing and promotion of rural bus services is often poor or lacklustre, especially towards a younger age group. There is little or no regard for the customer profile and what publicity there is tends to be formulaic and unimaginative.\n \nThe po\nrtrayal of b\nus transport in rural areas is \nstaid and comes across as \nthe preserve of the elderly or poor, which is wholly wrong.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhat are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities? How can these services be made more affordable?&#xa0;\n3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere has to be \nan \nacceptance that delivering bus transport for remote rural communities is not and never will \nbe \nas cost effective as it is in urban areas, or even clusters of market towns; but that inhabitants of rural communities sh\nould not be penalised for this. Indeed, it is arguable that people from deep rural areas are more in need of effective and efficient transport solutions, as transport poverty can lead to real \nand not just relative \nsocial isolation.\n&#xa0;\n3.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMore imaginative approa\nches to rural bus transport have to be trialled that seek to integrate services and so reduce unit costs\n (see below)\n; encourage local providers like \nC\nommunity \nT\nransport operators to play a more proactive role; and explore new ways of working like demand \nresponsive minibuses instead of old and inflexible 50-seater coaches (see below).\n&#xa0;\n3.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn my own area (the Derbyshire Peak District) any subsidised bus service deemed visitor-orient\ned is being cut – but this is an entirely \nbackward-looking \nstep\n! In a popular N\national Park visitors should be using buses to get around and reach the remote villages and walks that they are seeking\n, just\n as long as they \ncan\n get to \nthe location, \nthe timetable\n meets their needs and the service is reliable\n. And if they were doing this \nin sufficient number\ns\n the\n routes\n wouldn’t need so much subsidy and the services could \nin turn \nbe more affordable to local people. Local tourism businesses and attractions \nmight then\n sponsor or advertise on the buses more and thus \nhelp drive down costs furt\nher.\n \nRural buses must be marketed to all users so that all users benefit.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow do Government and local authorities identify demand for passenger transport in isolated communities?&#xa0;\n3.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOne of the obvious first steps is to understand the rural communities \nthemselves –\n where people\n want to go, when, how, etc? Parish Councils and community groups can help with accessibility audits to plot work/shopping/health/leisure transport movements of local residents, so that gaps and opportunities can be identified, pilot service ideas can be w\norked up and even more creative solutions such as local travel clubs explored.\n In this way transport should be made a key plank of emerging Neighbourhood Plans\n so that local communities take more ownership of transport matters and themselves identify possi\nble solutions\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTransport operators, social enterprises, local authorities – whoever! – should work hand in hand with these local representatives to explore new delivery models that connect village to village, village to town, etc, and seek to integrate as\n many types of journey as possible\n. For example, a \nshopping\n \nservice from a cluster of villages to a town that is also timed to coincide with the \nhealth centre’s\n opening hours; \nan early morning work/training \nbus\n that goes on to \ndo \na\n school\n run\n; an \nevening \ns\nervice \nfrom villages \nto an adult education centre \nin a nearby town \nthat also visits the local cinema/skate park, etc\n. The aim is to reduce unit costs, create a single market and optimise the operator’s resources. \n&#xa0;\n3.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhink bold, think imaginatively! Instead \nof rigid timetabled services that don’t necessarily correspond with people’s desired journey times and patterns, perhaps a demand responsive approach \nmight\n work best\n in some rural locations\n? Moorlands Connect \nbus \nservice (run by Ashbourne Community Transpo\nrt) is one such example, combining shopping services and even school runs for remote villages on the Staffordshire Moorlands with \nincome\n from visiting walkers and cyclists\n, since \nthe\n buses have bike racks attached\n (\nwww.staffordshire.gov.uk/transport/public\ntransport/buses/connect/\n \nMoorlandsConnect.aspx\n).\n&#xa0;\n3.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nd\nemand responsive transport (DRT) \nconcept \ncan take some understand\ning\n, but essentially only sending a vehicle where it’s needed and when makes perfect sense\n in the rural context where passenger patterns can alter\n (and if \nthe bus i\ns idle for too long there’s something wrong with its coverage, promotion or pricing). \nHowever,\n DRT can also operate very well on a semi-flexible \nor semi-timetabled \nbasis, so that the\n drive\nr can deviate from a set route to collect passengers\n. I\nt’s ideal for a rural bus route that connects a string of villages and hamlets \n(\nwith \nfluctuating passenger numbers) to \na town.\n Although DRT can be expensive to set up, if it’s designed so that it\n incorporates other services (eg \na \ndaily run to a rural primary \nschool, a regular adult social care run, a weekly luncheon club run for elderly villagers, etc) and also marketed to other users like visitors, then it can be cost effective and viable for rur\nal situations. \n&#xa0;\n3.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere needs to be more joined-up thinking from transport authorities and operators, so that, for instance, bus routes from remoter rural locations \nclearly \nact as feeders to main bus routes\n and the \nwider rural \nbus\n network is presented more \nlogically and \ncoherently. As an example, see the Interconnect and Call Connect rur\nal bus networks in Lincolnshire that all feed into each other and are presented as such\n (www.lincsinterconnect.com).\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?&#xa0;\n3.12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCommunity \nT\nransport \noperators (CTOs) \nha\nve\n the potential to \ndeliver effective local solutions for rural people, not least because of their social commitment, \nenerg\ny and enthusiasm, \nlocal knowledge, \nas well as \ncapacity and expertise\n in\n deal\ning\n with elderly a\nnd disabled passengers\n. \nIn fact, there are numerous examples where CTOs are already a lifeline for people with access issues from remote or hard-to-reach rural co\nmmunities. Furthermore\n, many \nCTOs\n \nare already and successfully \nrunning contracted services for local authorities, NHS trusts, and so on. \n&#xa0;\n3.13\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, t\noo many service commissioners still appear to regard CTOs as amateurish and voluntary, fringe transport \nfor\n older people \non the \ncheap\n. \nMany l\nocal authorities in particular need to start embracing Community Transport as part of the solution for delivering rural public transport in deep rural areas and work with them\n on a more level playing field, rather than tur\nning to the commercial operators first every time. Procurement processes still tend to be geared up towards the big operators and it can be a frustrating and difficult nut for CTOs to crack.\n \nI\nt’s\n \nhope\nd\n that the Public Services (Social Value) Act may gradua\nlly begin to change procurement attitudes – but \nthere\n doesn’t seem to be \nmuch evidence of this\n yet.\n \nPerceptions of\n Community Transport must change if CTOs are to play a more fulfilling role.\n&#xa0;\n3.14\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWith some notable exceptions, CTOs themselves are mostly small social enterprises and organisations that are at various stages of \nrelatively\n early \ngrowth. Some will probably choose to stay small and local, but those others that seek to grow need more assis\ntance in terms of business advice and development, \nso that they can \nbuild \ncapacity and \nresilience, \nimprove their \nfinancial know-how and so on. (This is evidenced with the recent sad demise of Little Red Bus and Nene &amp; Ouse Community Transport.)\n&#xa0;\n3.15\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWithout lo\nsing sight of their social goals, these CTOs also need to be encouraged to think more enterprisingly and so overcome \ninternal \ncultural barriers as well as physical \nchallenges\n like cash flow, \nregulations, contract law, accreditation, \netc. \nThere’s a need for\n training for board members/trustees and not just key staff in terms of strategic development and risk taking, for example. Although most CTOs may be young and relatively small, those that I have come across certainly have the drive and commitment to deliv\ner effective transport solutions for rural communities – they just need the right \nsocial enterprise \ntools and opportunities.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.16\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn most instances CTOs will simply be part of the rural transport mix and transport authorities and service commissioners must \nunderstand this a little better, recognising both the strengths and limitations\n of Community Transport\n. While the big commercial \noperators will\n no doubt carry on\n cover\ning\n the main through routes, busy school runs, etc, CTOs are ideally placed to supply the\n feeder services, link the remoter and hard to reach villages, not least because of the composition of their fleets (accessible small minibuses) and expert knowledge \nin terms o\nf both local geography and running demand responsive services. Th\nere are\n already\n work\nable examples\n in some locations, but elsewhere \nnational operators are still paid to trundle \nempty service buses \naround villages\n \nbased on\n inflexible timetables.\n&#xa0;\n3.17\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDespite \nthe shortcomings and barriers\n, where Community Transport is well run \n– \nand in particular works with a progressive local authority \nto address \nparticular \nissue\ns – \nit is quite clear that it can deliver lasting results for rural communities. For instance, see bus routes operated by Third Sector Services and CCVS Trading\n \nin the Co\ntswolds, or the Suffolk Links DRT routes run by \nCoastal Accessible Transport Services\n (\nwww.suffolkonboard.com/suffolk-links-demand-responsive-transport\n)\n.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1\n&#xa0;\n"
