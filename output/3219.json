"Written evidence submitted by Laura Brickell&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSummary&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.  My Aims&#xa0;I am writing as an individual, and one of many,  who would like to live in a rural community, but who is unable to do so for lack of acce\nss to land whereupon I might be allowed to build a modest dwelling and create my income from that land.   \n&#xa0;\nI would wish to join forces with others as a co-operative of some description,  in order to buy a woodland with a view to:   \n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nmanaging the wood\nland for timber, wildlife and \nfuelwood\n \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ncreating a forest garden (food security using perennial woodland and fruiting plants)\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nbuilding our  own houses using the resources of the woodland and the local community to high environmental standards (\nroundwoo\nd\n, \nstrawbale\n and such like)\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ncreating businesses using the resources of the woodland and local community (willow basketry, mushroom farming, market gardening, orchard and berry fruit, cottage food industries, \nbeekeeping, \narts and crafts and such like\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nen\nhancing the attractions for tourists (woodland walks and bike tra\nils, activity days for families)\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nenhancing the facilities and attractions for the local community (educational and volunteering opportunities, forest schools, craft workshops and such like)\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nproviding work opportunities and training for local youth \n&#xa0;\nMany of these ideas are familiar and have proven exciting and successful \nopportunities for community-\nowned woodlands, but in order for rural communities to remain sustainable, multi-generational \npopulations and facilities\n are urgently required.  Housing remains a major problem with rural populations ageing, schools closing and along with them the social f\nabric as facilities dwindle (doctors &amp; dentists, shops, libraries, banks, post-offices, bus services etc \netc\n).\n  Meanwhile, \ncrofting\n lands are increasingly abandoned and unproductive as their tenants age.\n&#xa0;\n2.  The land-ownership pattern is sustained and reinforced by subsidy and taxation arrangements in anumber of ways:&#xa0;-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSubsidy and tax advantages inflate land values, which limits new entrants,\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe use of land as an investment vehicle rewards speculation and inhibits innovation\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSubsidy and tax advantages ensure the price of land is divorced from its productive value,  which rewards inertia and inhibits sustainable development.\n&#xa0;\n3.  A Land Agency should\n function to\n enforce and proactively enable Land Reform\n with a view to increasi\nng productivity, biodiversity, community buy-outs, community owned energy projects and liberating abandoned croft lands, assisting planning permissions for new builds on croft lands, creating new croft and woodland crofts as well as helping newcomers throu\ngh the process of finding and purchasing land and self-build planning.   \n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n"
