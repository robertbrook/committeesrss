"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Gillespie Robertson (CLC003)1.\nCurrent state of public understanding \n(\nand recent changes in that state\n)\n : \n educated adults used to understand \nthe words \n“climate change” as meaning \nobservable and measurable movement\ns\n \nin the ever-changing  global and regional climate over all time-scales \nin the history of planet \nearth \nand \nof \nhuman civilisation\n, \n \nand also as experienced by \nany \nobse\nrvant individual\n throughout \n his or her\n  lifet\nime . \nOver the last one or two decades, \n \neducated \npeople \nhave been surprised and disappointed to see and  hear these words used \nalmost exclusively\n, both\n \nby \nmany\n \nill-informed \npoliticians\n and \n by alarmist doomsayers\n, \n as if they meant “catastrophic \nanthropogenic\n global warming\n (CAGW.) \n”\n My own understanding has improved immeasurably from nearly 5 years of \ncareful and detailed \nreading on all sides \nmostly of the scientific, but also of the \npolitical\n, \n arguments. Above all I have come to understand how the modesty of early climate scientist-historians such as Hubert Lamb has given way to the arrogance of those who pretend \nthat \nmankind’s \nknowledge of \nthe different \nfactors\n which\n drive the earth’s climate is \nanything \nother than minimal\n,\n prim\nitive, and thus incidentally grossly inadequate in terms of supporting any related Governmental policy initiatives other than a need to carry out fundamental research on ALL climate drivers.\n2.\nTrusted voices\n :  those very few\n who concentrate on measurable and observed climate data  and who use moderate and temperate language\n, \n rather than \nthose who rely\n on unproven and falsifiable hypotheses, \n publicise \ncomputer-modelled scenarios,  \nissue public \ndoomsday predictions,  \nand\n/or\n  \nmake highly \npersonal attacks on those who disagree with them.\n3.\nRole of Government\n :  it was the Nazi propagandist Dr. Goebbels,  of eternal infamy,  who said “It is the absolute right of the State to supervise the formation of public opinion.” \n  All decent people should and \nmost \ndo recoil in horror from the direction in which this sort of thinking leads.  The lamentable track record to date of \nU.K. \nGovernment Departments , “scientific advisers” and “publicly funded scientists”  in \nlargely \nsupporting a\n highly dubious \n and often scientifically illiterate \nalarmist \n“climate change” \nmessage to the public underscores the view that \n Governments and their advisers should lean over backwards to avoid ALL  propaganda in respect of “climate science.”\n4.\nImproving public understanding\n :  \nyour questionnaire \nis\n fundamentally \n flawed. It \nstarts from a number of wrong premises  --  \n you appear to proceed from the assumption that CAGW (see above) is true, deadly and happening now. This leads to the second assumption  : that rising scepticism must be because people are ignorant or ill-informed. The third  -- and typically totalitarian  --  assumption then follows, namely that what is needed is re-education. \nBarriers to understanding\n : t\nhe main \none \nis a lack of knowledge. The answer is personal effort to\n obtain, study and interpret  data\n, not \nto read \nGovernment propaganda. \nThe media’s role\n : this is already, and\n is more likely  than  not to \ncontinue to \nbe\n, \n largely negative\n in terms of \nworking against \nthe public interest which Government is supposed to serve \n  : bad news sells, and alarmist \nclimate \npropaganda is “bad news.”\n The worst possible scenario is of a Government-controlled media. To quote the appalling Dr. Goebbels again, “Think of the Press as a great keyboard on which the Government can play.” \n5.\nPublic understanding and policy formation\n:  one can only hope that the public will increasingly recognise\n the folly of \nits \nGovernment behaving like King Canute of legend.  The arrogance and folly of humans p\nretending to have a \n“climate change policy” \nat all,  let alone an effective one, \nis beyond belief\n ;\n  and if one looks at the entire global picture,  the arrogance and folly of the U.K. Government in particular is unparalleled.\n6.\nPublic attitudes and energy policy\n : \n there is much evidence that most politicians are still unaware of the extent to which the educated public is waking up to the folly of recent and current U.K energy policy, based as it is on promoting and subsidising the least efficient, least reliable and highest cost forms of electricity generation on the basis of “climate science” and in the name of “saving the planet from dangerous climate change.”    One must fervently hope that  our political class will very soon wake up to the scientific realities and to the \nextremely damaging \neconomic and social consequences of \nrecent energy policies and initiatives.\n7.\nGovernment expertise in social and behavioural sciences\n : your question is confused,  but has unpleasant Orwellian undertones of totalitarian thinking.\n8.\nCan lessons be learned from other countries\n ?  Global evidence points to increasing public disaffection with \nand (with the exception of small but very well-funded pressure groups) disengagement from \nGovernmental focus on “climate change policy”  as a major societal concern. It seems probable that Governments which continue with  such a focus will \neventually lose public support for their entire political platforms, simply  because of the severe economic and even environmental damage which some of those policies are increasingly wreaking. \n April 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
