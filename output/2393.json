"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Chris Evershed [OLS0025]&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOur young people are the future of the nation.  Without them there\n is no future.  How careful we need then to be in caring for and educating them so that a generation emerges that the country can be proud of.\n&#xa0;\nThe internet has brought considerable benefits to children, society and the business world\n.  However it can, and\n is\n, \nbeing used to corrupt society and the very children that it should benefit.\n  \nIt is a sorrowful statistic \nas stated by\n \nOfcom\n, \nthat 81% of children aged 14 to 16 have viewed adult material online, whilst only 46% of parents have filters \nin place on thei\nr home internet.\n&#xa0;\nPornographic images can be viewed \non the internet \nby young persons, so warping their minds\n. \nThis can only lead to a rapid decline in moral standards, increased delinquency, dysfunctional families, and a proliferation of adults with no mor\nal structure or ability to discriminate bet\nw\neen \nr\night and wrong, good and evil.  Because they see adults engaging in such actions it must be OK.\n&#xa0;\nThe government needs to act now and decisively\n,\n to address this extremely serious problem. \nDefault blocking of\n all adult content should be the standard setting on all equipment sold in the UK that is able to access the internet, combined\n with robust age verification.  Without this, children will continue to be damaged\n irretrievably.\n&#xa0;\nThere is also \na \ntremendous\n increase in child pornography\n polluting the internet, and r\nesearch by the Child Exploitation and Online P\nrotection Centre (CEOP) has alleged\n that more than half of those who\n view child abuse images go on to commit abuse themselves.  \nThis is a proof of the\n vicious spiral of moral decline that sets in \nwhen such activity is allowed.\n \nInternet Search Providers\n should be held\n responsible to track do\nwn child pornography and\n remove such images from the internet.\n \n&#xa0;\nIt is well to remember that the decline and fall o\nf the Roman Empire was not due to \nany lack in the\n military might, by which the\nir\n empire was formed, but by moral decline and degeneracy.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
