default&#xa0;
default2.1
default              
defaultDefra led for the UK on the EU negotiations on the new CAP, working 
defaultclosely 
defaultwith all Devolved Administrations. As EU negotiations draw to a conclusion, Defra is increasing the emphasis on how the new CAP is implemented in England. The 
defaultD
defaultevolved Administrations are similarly looking at how they will implement the new CAP.
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default              
defaultDefra is responsible
default for negotiations at UK level,
default for the development of implementing policies and regulations in England and for the development of 
defaultthe supporting delivery mechanisms including the necessary IT systems, administrative and inspection functions.
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default              
defaultT
defaulthe outcome of negotiations did not 
defaultmove the CAP anything like as far as the UK wanted in the direction of reform. From a UK perspective, 
defaultt
defaulthe CAP should be about helping the EU agriculture sector to become more competitive and market-oriented whilst providing environmental public goods that the market does not reward.
default 
defaultNevertheless, 
defaultDefra is aiming to implement the deal in 
defaulta 
defaultway which 
defaultis
default as simple, affordable and effective as possible. 
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default              
defaultIn August we published two Status Reports, one on the new Rural Development Programme in England
default and one on Direct Payments
default. The former presented an update on developments with some factual background on Rural Development Programme (RDP), whilst the latter we provided a summary of what has been agreed about the new direct payments system and set out our approach to implementation in England. 
default&#xa0;
default2.5
default              
defaultDefra wants to see a competitive farming industry that faces less red tape, takes advantage of export opportunities and is less reliant on public subsidy.  Over the next seven years the UK 
defaultis expected to 
defaultreceive 
defaultabout 
default£17.8 billion under Pillar 1 on direct subsidies and £1.84 billion under Pillar 2 on the environment and rural development (subject to confirmation
default, both figures are 2011 prices
default). Where Defra has greater discretion on how CAP money is spent, we need to make sure it is spent efficiently, in the right places and where it adds greatest public value. Whatever decisions are taken on the implementation of the CAP, and specifically in relation to the potential transfer of money from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2, the majority of CAP payments will still be to farmers through 
defaultthe 
defaultPillar 1 
defaultDirect P
defaultayment
default Scheme
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.6
default              
defaultThe next CAP can make a significant contribution through 
defaultrural development funding 
defaultto improving the environment, 
defaultinvesting in farming competitiveness and growing the wider rural economy in England. 
default&#xa0;
default3.1
default              
defaultWhile 
defaultDefra
default felt the Commission had identified the right challenges in its Communication of 2010 – the need to increase agricultural productivity to meet growing world demand for food and at the same time reduce environmental impact – we were disappointed at the lack of ambition the Commission showed in the package of CAP proposals published on 12 October 2011. The UK did not see how the initial proposals would address the objectives the Commission had identified.
default&#xa0;default3.2
default              
defaultThis was the first CAP Reform to be co-decided with the European Parliament (EP), following the entry into force of the Treaty on the Functioning of the E
defaulturopean 
defaultU
defaultnion
default (Lisbon Treaty). 
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default              
defaultAfter months of detailed negotiations, the Council of Ministers, European Parliament (EP) and European Commission agreed a new CAP deal in principle in June 2013.
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default              
defaultAt the time of the June deal, MEPs had insisted that agreement was still outstanding on elements of the CAP package linked to the EU Budget agreement in February 2013.  These outstanding issues were discussed and resolved with minimal changes to the CAP package in September 2013. The EP is now expected to vote on the CAP package in mid-November followed by final approval from the Council of Ministers in December 2013. 
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default              
defaultCAP implementing legislation will follow from the European Commission; to be agreed by in the first half of 2014.  This legislation will provide the detail to the main CAP regulations agreed this year. The full CAP package will take effect from 2015
default 
defaultwith the 
defaultsCMO
default coming fully into effect before then in 2014.  A transitional regulation for 2014 is being agreed in parallel with the main CAP regulations and will also be subject to final approval in December 2013.
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default              
defaultThe UK negotiated hard to secure a final outcome on the CAP regulations that overall was a significant improvement on the Commission’s original proposals. However, it is still very disappointing and does not move CAP anything like as far as we’d have wanted in the direction of reform.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.1
default              
defaultMany scheme rules are set out in the EU regulations and we have no choice other than to follow them.  However there are aspects where we have options on how we implement elements of CAP. Where there is scope to do so, 
defaultDefra 
defaultis aiming 
defaultto implement the new CAP in England
default in ways which are simple, affordable and effective
default. Simplicity for 
defaultthose 
defaultappl
defaultying 
defaultfor CAP funding as well as for our delivery bodies administering the systems will not only be more efficient but will also 
defaulthelp reduce
default the risk of disallowance. 
defaultDefra’s
default approach to implementing the revised CAP is intended to meet wider government better regulation commitments and to minimise as much as possible the potential burdens on CAP customers.
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default              
defaultDefra is determined to 
defaultlearn from and 
defaultavoid 
defaultrepeating 
defaultthe mistakes of 2005, when policy choices were made that did not work well on the ground. This caused unnecessary uncertainty and delayed payments to a significant number of farmers and ultimately cost the taxpayer dearly 
defaultin EU fines. 
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default              
defaultWe have reviewed 
defaultthe recommendations from the multiple reports that looked in detail at the 2005 implementation to make sure we understand what went wrong then and to ensure it does not happen again. We have identified
default six 
defaultthemes that run through the problems in 2005 that we continuously monitor
default. 
defaultThese are:
default&#xa0;
defaulta)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEnsuring policy is deliverable

default and 
defaultstriving for early certainty where it is possible to

defaultf)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultE
defaultnsure that lines of communication between Defra, agencies and Stakeholders are clear.
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default              
defaultKey stages in the coming months include the following, which may be subject to change:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.5
default              
defaultBeyond January 2015, we will be looking ahead to the next round of CAP negotiations; in particular, what can be done to help ensure a better set of Commission proposals for the next CAP regulations that will take effect after 2020.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.1
default              
defaultWe 
defaultare
default commit
defaultted
default to the principles of co-design and early 
defaultinvolvement
default by working with the interested parties on the best ways to implement the various elements of CAP. 
defaultConsulting widely and engaging openly with the farming industry and other interested groups will 
defaulthelp 
defaultensure we make the right decisions
default for customers and the public purse
default. 
defaultThis will also help us ensure we don’t repeat the mistakes of 2005. 
defaultWe have sought to listen to the widest 
defaultvariety of views on CAP Reform during EU negotiations and ha
defaultve
default maintained this approach as we prepare for implementation in England. 
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default              
defaultOur approach addresses 
defaultrecommendations from the Farm Regulation Task Force.
default For example, we have been working closely with the farming organisations, our delivery bodies and other interested parties on the development of proposals on the implementation of the Direct Payment Schemes and the new environmental land management schemes.
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default              
defaultThe openness of our approach does not mean everyone with an interest in the new 
defaultCAP will agree on everything. There will undoubtedly be strong and divergent views, as there were during the negotiations. There will be difficult decisions. Some elements of the new CAP will increase complexity and it is important that we minimise these where we can.  
default&#xa0;
default5.4
default              
defaultThe Secretary of State, other Ministers, and officials have engaged directly and frequently with the farming industry and other interested groups. Defra has held several events in recent months, attended by Ministers, to hear first-hand from a broad range of 
defaultinterested groups on their thoughts about CAP implementation
default. These events have been informative and have helped to shape the formal public consultation
default. For example, 
defaultMinisters took account of views 
defaultexpressed 
defaultin deciding to consult on as much of the CAP package as possible at this stage, and in framing the consultation questions. 
default&#xa0;
default5.5
default              
defaultCAP touches a wide range of agricultural, rural, environmental and other interests. Defra and its delivery bodies are working closely together to ensure a coherent and consistent approach to engaging with this wide range of interested groups and individuals, drawing on the expertise and understanding shared between the organisations. At a practical level, the relevant teams meet monthly to plan activity. 
default&#xa0;
default5.6
default              
defaultWe will consult formally on the implementation of CAP shortly. Our intention is to make the consultation as comprehensive as possible to help interested parties to reach an informed view on interrelated issues. In some cases the Government already has a clear view on the way forward, or has already had to make decisions due to the long lead 
defaulttime for implementing aspects of the schemes or the need for farmers to have certainty. In these cases the consultation document will set out what we have decided. In other areas we will be seeking views in order to make the best informed choices.
default&#xa0;
default5.7
default              
defaultThere are some constraints that affect the timetable for consultation. We need to notify the Commission formally by 31 December 2013 on whether and to what extent we wish to transfer funds from the CAP budget for direct payments (Pillar 1) to fund rural development (Pillar 2), which is part of this consultation. 
default&#xa0;
default5.8
default              
defaultThere are some detailed issues on which it would not be sensible to reach a view until we have more information from the European Commission about 
defaultthe application of the rules. We plan to engage closely with stakeholders on these issues as the details from the EU processes emerge.
default&#xa0;
default5.9
default              
defaultThe consultation is part of a much broader approach to engagement with interested parties.
default&#xa0;
default5.10
default              
defaultWith the consultation we propose to publish an analysis of the main impacts of the new CAP. This will include evidence on
default the impact 
defaultof the decisions to be taken
default, but 
defaultalso considers 
defaultthe value for money for tax payers, and the costs to consumers of 
defaultCAP as a whole
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default6.1
default              
defaultDefra is aiming to improve customer service and value for money 
defaultand reduce disallowance risk 
defaultthrough developing a new single online CAP application and payment system
default, ready for scheme year 2015
default.
default 
defaultWhile the CAP negotiations have been 
defaultunderway
default 
defaultthe CAP Delivery programme 
defaulthas
default been able to co
defaultntinue development of the 
defaultsystem as 
defaultit is being built
default it in a flexible way that will allow us to integrate any changes 
defaultin implementation 
defaultas they occur
default.  
default&#xa0;
default6.2
default              
defaultThe programme has been consulting with interest groups from to understand user needs and inform the development of a system 
defaultwhich is 
defaulteasy to use and intuitive
default. Fortnightly
default user research is carried out with farmers, land managers, agents and future applicants, who provide feedback on iterations of the system as part of continuous improvement to the design and functionality.  The programme is also more broadly engaging stakeholders, individually and via established consultative groups, customers and staff to get ready for the shift to both this new system and new schemes.
default&#xa0;
default6.3
default              
defaultIn line with the government’s digital agenda, the new CAP service is designed to be “digital by 
defaultdesign
default”. The programme recognises in the 
defaultearly days of the new service, customers will require support to cope with a lot of change and some may have a 
default‘
defaultgenuine need’ to assisted digital entry. The programme is listening to stakeholders’ concerns about the digital by 
defaultdesign
default approach given shortfalls in rural broadband coverage and 
defaultis 
defaultworking with them and the Government Digital Service to 
defaultencourage
default digital uptake and 
defaultto 
defaultformulate options 
defaultfor those who genuinely can’t access the new system
default;
default these may include a role for 
defaulttelephone 
defaultchannels and utilising delivery body advisers
default. The 
defaultSecretary of State will take the 
defaultfinal decision on which option
defaults are available.
default 
default&#xa0;
default6.4
default              
defaultThe programme has
default reduce
defaultd
default 
defaultdelivery risks
default and
default the
default costs of development
default by integrating existing 
defaulttried and tested CAP software where available 
defaultwith 
defaultbespoke 
defaultdevelopment where needed
default. 
defaultThis includes the procurement of 
defaulta system which is used across three European countries and manages 2 million farmers’ 
defaultCAP 
defaultpayments. This 
defaultsystem will
default meet some of 
defaultthe development
default needs, is compliant with the 
defaultrequirements of the 
defaultcurrent CAP 
defaultregulations 
defaultand has not resulted in any disallowance costs. 
defaultThe 
defaultcontract 
defaultfor the 
defaultScheme 
defaultAccounting and Payment function has been awarded to Hitachi.
default&#xa0;
default6.5
default              
defaultThe first piece of completed development is a
default Rural Land Registry (RLR)
default map v
defaultiewer
default, due to be released to RPA customers in November.  This is aimed to encourage
default customers 
defaultto 
defaultmake the transition to online systems
default.  The build is now focusing on development of the CAP services screens and the process for customer registration which will be ready for release in summer 2014. Other 
defaultworkstreams
default are delivering the migration of customer data, business transition and integration with existing systems that will be required.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default7.1
default              
defaultThe Single Common Market Organisation (
defaultsCMO
default) regulation lays down rules for the common organisation of agricultural markets. Market measures set out in the 
defaults
defaultCMO
default regulation include the tools used to provide a safety net at times of market crisis inside the EU
default,
default trade and competition rules, quota systems, specific marketing standards that apply to certain sectors and/or products, individual aid schemes and the promotion of producer organisations 
default(POs) 
defaultand inter-branch organisations
default (IBOs) that operate more widely than POs by working along the supply chain
default. 
defaultThe safety net includes 
defaultintervention, export refunds, private storage aid and the provision of a new crisis reserve
default. T
defaulthe quota systems in the sugar and wine sectors will now be in place for extended periods
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default7.2
default              
defaultIn most cases, the new 
defaultsCMO
default regulation updates existing provisions rather than representing a radical reform, however several of the changes that have been made
default rollback previous CAP reforms and went against the Lisbon Treaty in transferring additional powers to the EP. At Agriculture Council in June
default 2013
default the UK and Germany could not support the 
defaults
defaultCMO
default regulation due to the amendments that had been made in order to reach a compromise with the European Parliament. The UK and Germany therefore abstained in the 
defaultsCMO
default vote to enable agreement on the overall CAP package.
default&#xa0;default7.3
default              
defaultThe revised 
defaultsCMO
default regulation will:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default7.4
default              
defaultThe 
defaultsCMO
default regulation is directly applicable in the UK. However, there are 2 key provisions in the regulation where Member States can decide what approach they wish to take
default:
default whether to extend formal recognition of PO
defaults
default to all sectors, and whether or not to make it compulsory for farmers to have written contracts with processors or distributors. At this stage the Government is yet to be convinced that choosing to implement either of these options would add significant value, as other forms of co-operation are already available to producers that do not necessitate them meeting requirements set by Europe, and the vast majority of domestic farmers already have a written contract with the processing company or distributor that buys their produce. 
default&#xa0;
default7.5
default              
defaultThe 
defaultsCMO
default regulation will come into force from January 1, 2014. 
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default8.1
default              
defaultThe current Single Payments Scheme (SPS) will be replaced under CAP reform from 2015 with a new system of Direct Payments.  
default&#xa0;
default8.2
default              
defaultThe
default Status Report on Direct Payments
default, referred to above,
default describes in detail what has been agreed in the EU, although we still await the final text of the European Direct Payments regulation which is likely to be agreed only in November.
default 
defaultMany of the main parameters of the scheme will be defined in that regulation and in the 
defaultCommission
default implementing regulations which will be agreed in Brussels over the coming months. This 
defaultsection 
defaulttherefore gives only an overview of the Direct Payments system, and reference may be made to the Status Report for further information.
default&#xa0;
default8.3
default              
defaultWe expect 
defaultthe Autumn
default 2013 
defaultconsultation on CAP reform to include 
defaultour proposals for implementation of 
defaultDirect Payments
default, insofar as the European Direct Payments regulation affords discretion to Member States. The consultation paper
default 
defaultwill (among other things) invite views on a series of strategic Direct Payments implementation issues, including:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default8.4
default              
defaultMany features of the S
defaultingle Payment Scheme (S
defaultPS
default)
default will continue, but there are significant changes too.  
defaultFarmers will continue to qualify to receive an annual payment if they meet the conditions defined in the E
defaultU
default regulations. As under SPS, the key conditions will be that the farmer holds entitleme
defaultnts and has eligible land at their
default disposal for the relevant scheme year. In the case of 
defaulttenanted land in England, it will be the tenant who has the land at his disposal and therefore qualifies for the direct payment. 
default&#xa0;
default8.5
default              
defaultThe amount of the payment will depend on the number, and value, of entitlements supported by eligible land. 
defaultFarmers will not have to grow crops or keep livestock to be eligible for payment but 
defaultwill continue to have to meet the rules on cross compliance
default, which will be subject to some amendments
default. In addition, farmers will have to meet a new ‘active farmer test’, and 30% of the payment will depend on implementing greening measures (covered in the next section). There will be a system under which large payments are subject to a reduction. There is also a new scheme for young farmers. 
default&#xa0;
default8.6
default              
defaultThe consultation will not cover the question of whether entitlements should be carried forward from the current scheme or reissued at the start of the new scheme, as stakeholder organisations have stressed to us importance of giving farmers a decision as soon as possible to help with business planning. We therefore plan to announce a decision on this as soon as possible
default.
default&#xa0;
default8.7
default              
defaultThere are a number of other issues where it would not be sensible to decide how we should implement the scheme in England until we have clarity about the detailed rules which will be defined in the implementing regulations. The Commission will be publishing their proposals for these rules in stages over the coming weeks, and we expect the implementing regulations to be agreed by Easter 2014. We will be discussing the detailed aspects of scheme design with stakeholder organisations in the first half of 2014.
default&#xa0;
default8.8
default              
defaultThese issues include a number of detailed aspects of scheme design albeit ones which will be important to the farmers concerned. They include:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default8.9
default              
defaultIn addition to the forma
defaultl consultation in Autumn
default, we will continue to discuss Direct Payments implementation issues with key stakeholders in the Direct Payments Consultative Group, which meets at approximat
defaultely monthly intervals
default.
default8.10
default              
defaultAs Figure 1 shows, UK farmers may receive less per hectare than some other EU Member States but they receive more per farmer than most. However, th
defaultere are many factors which affect competitiveness in agriculture within the 
defaultEU and the impact of differing levels of direct payments in Pillar 1 between Member States has limited effect. The factors which have a greater impact on competitiveness include 
defaultnatural resources, wage leve
defaultls, tax and regulatory policies, and investment in 
defaultinnovation and training.
default  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultFigure 1: Average direct payments per beneficiary and per hectare in each member statedefault&#xa0;
default(Source: European Commission)
default&#xa0;
default8.11
default              
defaultThe new CAP includes a 
defaultprovision that 30% of a farmer’s
default Direct Payment should be conditional on them meeting certain criteria intended to be beneficial to the wider environment. This is referred to as “greening”. Ministers have decided that the broad approach to greening in England should be to adhere to the 
defaultagricultural practices 
defaultset out in the 
defaultDirect
default Payments Regulation and 
defaultis
default announced as part of the consultation package
default.
default&#xa0;
default8.12
default              
defaultThere has been an appetite from stakeholders for early clarity on the approach to greening. Arable farmers need the information as early as possible so that they can begin to make crop plans for the 2015 calendar year. Stakeholder organisations wished for clarity to help put into context their views on such issues as the level of financial transfer between pillars of the CAP and the approach that should be taken to successor 
defaultagri
default-environment schemes.
default&#xa0;
default8.13
default              
defaultTwo b
defaultroad approaches to greening are
default realistically
default 
defaultpossible
default:
default the one where we adhere to the 
defaultspecified agricultural practices
default, or an
defaultother
default based on the 
defaultoption 
defaultto implement greening through a 
defaultN
defaultational Certification Scheme that includes additional measures
default that are equivalent 
defaultto the 
defaultspecified agricultural practices
default. 
defaultMinisters are minded not to choose 
defaultthe second approach because, although it has the potential to bring enhanced environmental benefit, 
defaultwe
default could only do this at increased cost and increased risk
default. 
defaultThere would be increased costs to farmers who chose the equivalent measures, increased implementation costs and delivery risk to delivery agencies and increased risk of disallowance as we moved away from the basic model which we expect to be implemented elsewhere in 
defaultthe EU. Set against this we consider
default that the additional environmental benefits might be small in the context of a Certification Scheme in which farmers were able to choose simpler and cheaper alternatives and so where uptake of the more beneficial options might be low.
default&#xa0;
default8.14
default              
defaultT
defaulthis approach is consistent with the Government’s view that it is Pillar II of the CAP, not Pillar I initiatives such as greening, which provid
defaultes the optimum mechanism to deliver
default the majority of environmental outcomes from English farmland.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default9.1
default              
defaultThe Status Report on the New Rural Development Programme in England (RDP) referred to above, set out our understanding of many aspects of the RDP at that time. 
defaultThe new RDP provides a major opportunity to invest in the rural economy and environment. 
defaultOur plan is for t
defaulthe new programme 
defaultto
default begin formally on 1 January 2015. The Government’s objectives for the next programme in England are to:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default9.2
default              
defaultThe new programme will be governed by a new EU Rural Development Regulation
default, which forms part of the new CAP package being agreed. 
default&#xa0;
default9.3
default              
defaultThe Regulation outlines six broad ‘priorities’ for the EU for rural development. Member States must aim to meet at least four of the priorities in the design 
defaultof
default their programmes. These priorities are broken down into a number of ‘focus areas’ under which Member States are required to identify activity for funding through their programmes. The six priorities are:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default9.4
default              
defaultThe RDP must include at least 30% of EU funding on measures to protect and enhance the environment and at least 5% through the local delivery mechanism known as the LEADER approach.
default&#xa0;
default9.5
default              
defaultDefra will manage the next RDP.  A proportion of RDP funds in England will be channelled through an EU growth programme along with the EU structural funds, with Local Enterprise Partnerships determining how that funding is used.  This element of RDP funding will be used specifically in rural areas for b
defaultuilding knowledge and skills;
default f
defaultunding new and developing micro, small and medium sized business; 
defaultf
defaultunding small scale renewable and broadband Investments; and 
defaults
defaultupport for tourism activities
default.       
default&#xa0;
default9.6
default              
defaultWe believe that 
defaultr
defaultural development offers the best use of taxpayers’ money under the 
defaultCAP
default. It provides crucial funding that helps
default 
defaultimprove the environment
default,
default improve farmers’ competitiveness
default and
default grow the rural economy. 
defaultWe are already committed to spend over £2bn in the next RDP on multi-annual 
defaultagri
default-environment and forestry agreements signed up under the current programme.
default&#xa0;
default9.7
default              
defaultThe Government 
defaultbelieves 
defaultthat 
defaultrewarding farmers for the environmental goods they provide is a much better use of taxpayers’ money than providing direct income support
default.  
defaultTransferring funding to rural development would also increase 
defaultthe 
defaultability to deliver improvements in the productivity and longer term competitiveness of UK agriculture and to help grow the rural economy in England
default. 
defaultWe 
defaulttherefore 
defaultwelcome the flexibility to transfer up to 15% of funds from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2. This is one of the key issues that we will be formally consulting on.
default  It is one of the factors that will determine the available budget in England, along with the allocation of CAP funds between England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.  
default&#xa0;
default9.8
default              
defaultWhatever the final budget
default for the next RDP
default we expect farmers and land-based industries will continue to receive by far the majority share of funding.
default&#xa0;
default9.9
default              
defaultWe want to improve value for money from RDP and to look for opportunities to achieve multiple objectives. We will be looking for views on how to focus the available budget.  More specifically we will be seeking views on:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default9.10
default              
defaultMuch of the 
defaultnew 
defaultprogramme will 
defaulttherefore 
defaultbe invested in environmental schemes that deliver multiple benefits and will be supported by investment in help to farmers to be more competitive and less reliant on subsidies and investment in long term. 
default&#xa0;

default Cross-Compliance is a set of rules that farmers claiming Direct Payments will have to comply with, as those claiming SPS currently do. Cross-Compliance comprises the need to comply with Statutory Management Requirements (SMRs) and to keep land in Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC). Some changes to Cross-Compliance will result from the new CAP.
