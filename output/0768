default&#xa0;
defaultThis model is an efficient use of the 
defaultspecialistsâ€™
default time and ensures that patients access 
defaultthe other services they require
default at the most appropriate point in their rehabilitation 
defaultpathway. This
default reduces waste and duplication, improves effectiveness and aligns with 
defaultthe right care, 
defaultright place, right time
default ethos.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultInterventions are delivered at a time and place to suit the patient and their families. This is often at home but can be a variety of community settings, including libraries, education settings, leisure facilities and the work place as required. Treatment programmes are individualised based on a comprehensive assessment and goals are agreed with the patient. Interventions continue as long as there are agreed, achievable rehabilitation goals
default and the focus is always self-management.
default&#xa0;
defaultFeedback is sought via questionnaire from patients and their families after 6 months with the service and after discharge. The information is used to guide service developments
default.

defaultConclusiondefault&#xa0;
defaultThe experience of the Nottingham Traumatic Brain Injury Service over 21 years demonstrates that a specialist multi professional team working to the case management model is an cost efficient and clinically effective method of providing support and rehabilitation to patients with complex physical, cognitive, psychological and social needs.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe believe that this model is applicable to other groups of patients with complex long term conditions and we would be happy to share our more of our skills, knowledge and experience with the select committee or other interested parties.
