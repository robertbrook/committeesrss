defaultQ137 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Welcome to this meeting of the Scottish Affairs Committee. As you are aware, we are conducting an inquiry into land reform in 
defaultScotland
default. We 
defaultanticipated having two separate panels
default,
default but because of travel difficulties we have me
defaultrged them together. We will take
default questions
default to 
defaultAndrew Leaver of Aigas Community Forest first
default,
default and then swing on to the more general issues
default and the other questions as and when
default. 
default              
defaultWould the members of the panel introduce themselves for the record and indicate to us who they work for?
defaultAndrew Leaverdefault: I am Andrew Leaver. I am the Secretary of Aigas Community Forest, which is a community group based about 16 miles from 
defaultInverness
default. We are attempting to purchase or take control of Forestry Commission land surrounding our village and community.
defaultRachael McCormackdefault: I am Rachael Mc
defaultCormack, Director of Highlands and
default Islands Enterprise.
defaultSandra Dunbardefault: I am Sandra Dunbar, Head of Business Improvement and Internal Audit 
defaultat Highlands and
default Islands Enterprise.
defaultEric Samueldefault: I am Eric Samuel, Senior Policy and Learning Manager at the Big Lottery Fund in 
defaultScotland
default.
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: I am Neil Ritch, the Deputy Director of the Big Lottery Fund in 
defaultScotland
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ138 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default We want to start off by looking at one particular example of a situation which developed where there were some difficulties about the use of state aid. Andrew, 
defaultI wonder whether you could
default tell us a little bit about your organisation and the experience you have had to date with trying to obtain state aid, which I understand has not gone quite as smoothly as you might have hoped.
defaultAndrew Leaverdefault: Our group is attempting to purchase a parcel of land or forest t
defaulthat the Forestry Commission 
defaultdeemed surplus. We started that process five years ago. At that point in time there was no Scottish Land Fund
default,
default but we were encouraged to attempt to do something on the basis that legislation and policy may change.
default              
defaultAbout two years ago—
defaultI lose track of time
default—we
default had been trying different activities. The Scottish Land Fund was relaunched
default,
default and we had a meeting with a member of staff from Highlan
defaultds and
default Islands Enterprise, which was very encouraging. I cannot hold the guy to it—it is not his fault—but he suggested that we could get a large sum of money, in the region of potentially 
default£500,000, which was a big sum in
default the £700,000 purchase price
default,
default and that we should make an application. It was very good.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ139 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Which organisation gave you that impression?
defaultAndrew Leaverdefault: A guy from Highlands and
default Islands Enterprise. Unfortunately what then happened, and I do not know how, is that about two weeks later or shortly afterwards—this is about two years ago now
default—we were informed by Highlands and
default Islands Enterprise that there could be some issues or problems with the allocation of funds from the Scottish Land Fund for the purchase of forestry by community groups. This related to application of the Eur
defaultopean Union state aid regulations. When we went in for a meeting it was made clear to us that the state aid regulations were being applied such that the maximum grant could be 20% of the value of the forest
default, or €200,000, whatever that equivalent may be.
default              
defaultAt that time we were attempting to buy a £700,000 forest
default,
default and the grant that we might have been able to obtain was nowhere near enough to get us toward that £700,000 figure. In the last two years
default,
default we have ha
defaultd to spend more time identifying other potential ways of taking control of the forest. The biggest
default problem was the 
defaultsudden
default—to us—apparent 
defaultapplication of state aid regulations to the Scottish Land Fund.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ140 default&#xa0; 
defaultSir James Paice:default 
defaultThank you very much for that, Mr Leaver. Can we be clear to start
default with
default? T
defaulthe £700,000 
defaultis 
defaultthe full open market valuation
default.
defaultAndrew Leaverdefault: Yes. It is a valuation undertaken by the district valuer.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ141 default&#xa0; 
defaultSir James Paice:default T
defaulthere was no question of a discount on the price; this was purely to enable you to fund the purchase at market pric
defaulte.
defaultAndrew Leaverdefault: It was actually £690,000, to be fair. It was provided by the district valuation service in 
defaultInverness
default as the full market value.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ142 default&#xa0; 
defaultSir James Paice:default I thought that was the case. I just wanted to get that clear
default,
default because there has been some co
defaultnfusion. When 
defaultHighlands and
default Islands
default Enterprise later produced this
default European rule of 20% or €200,000, apart from the inevitable heart attack, shock and all that 
defaultside of it, what did you do
default? Did you seek further clarification on that
default,
default or did you go for any other interpretation of the rules?
defaultAndrew Leaverdefault: We do not have th
defaulte right to appeal. There is nowhere we can go
default for alternative interpretation. I did write to the person here next to me, Rachael McCormack, asking for further information or some explanation. I probably wrote a letter saying, “I can’t believe this. It is an unbelievable occurrence.” Being a community member, you do that. I got a very bald answer just saying, “These are the rules; live with them.” At least that was my interpretation of the letter. We have no other recourse.
default              
defaultWhat was more promising perhaps—I lose track of time but it was probably summe
defaultr 2011, so maybe 18 months ago—wa
defaults that there was talk of trying to get some kind of block exemption for forestry. Different Highlands
default and
default Islands Enterprise staff talked about ideas that they were having and approaches they would make to try and improve things. There were some very good conversations
default,
default but that has led nowhere over this period. We have seen no progress in trying to overcome this interpretation of the state aid rules.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ143 default&#xa0; 
defaultSir James Paice:default Tell us about your plans for the forestry. Were you going to operate it in any commercial way? Would there be any form of trading involved? What were your plans?
defaultAndrew Leaverdefault: There is a story too. When we laun
defaultched our campaign—let’s call it—ou
defaultr attempt to buy the forest in 2009 
defaultwe were supported by Highlands and
default Islands Enterprise. We were told that we needed 
defaultto be a social enterprise; 
defaultwe needed to be an organisation that was run by the community, which was commercially viable and wh
defaultich would generate income that 
defaultcould be reinvested in the community. We pu
defaultt together a business plan that
default was about making money and reinvestment. 
defaultOf course t
defaulthat made us commercial
default,
default and therefore you have to apply the state aid regulations. That was a problem for us.
default              
defaultIn one of the conversations we had with HIE
default,
default it was 
defaultactually suggested to us that if communities were aiming to buy the land for social and environmental reas
defaultons and not economic ones, 
defaultmaybe they would not have to apply the state aid rules
default—maybe
default. 
defaultBut t
defaulthat was a complete reversal of the advice we had received three years previously, which was to be a social enterprise and to make money. We were getting contradictory information. I have to say that that one conversation never went anywhere, so I don’t think much of it. To us
default as
default a community group
default,
default it was a sign of the confusion that was going on within Highlands 
defaultand
default Islands Enterprise at that time.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ144 default&#xa0; 
defaultSir James Paice:default 
defaultJust for clarity, b
defaultefore moving on to the wider issue, I asked you the question about open market value
default,
default but if you had been able to persuade the Forestry Commission to s
defaultell it to you for less than 
defaultmarket value, that too would have fallen foul of state aid, or didn’t this arise?
defaultAndrew Leaverdefault: That did not arise. 
defaultMy understanding of the Forestry Commission is another issue, but t
defaulthe phrase
default the
defaulty 
defaultused 
defaultwas “protecting the taxpayers’ interest” and “getting best value for the taxpayer”, which is about the open market value. I have a whole rake of things to say about how the open market value is come to, but we will save that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ145 default&#xa0; 
defaultSir James Paice:default I am 
defaultabout to open that up for you, because my next question is
default from your evidence
default. You say
default that if the public benefits that could come from community ownership were i
defaultncorporated in the process, 
defaultthe market value might be lower. I think that is what you are suggesting. Basically that is an open question to answer as you wish.
defaultAndrew Leaverdefault: There are two things. 
defaultOn the open market value for forestry, 
defaultI have evidence
default,
default should 
defaultI want
default to read it out
default,
default from the DV
default, who
default clearly states in our valuation, and in valuations for other forests which I h
defaultave received, that the value placed on
default forestry 
defaultdoes not relate to the economic returns that can be gained from harvesting the woodland. It is about the value that is placed on it because of the tax benefits to a pr
defaultivate owner, and a
defaultlso sometimes—not with our particular fo
defaultrest but in other areas of the h
defaultighlands—because of the person
defaultal satisfaction and kudos of
default owning a piece of land on the west coast of Scotland
default. T
defaulthis adds a much inflated market value. 
default              
defaultCommunity groups do not have the same interest in owning a piece of land for vanity reasons
default,
default and certainly do not have the same tax benefits in terms of inheritance and capital gains tax. The inflated value that the market puts on it is a problem for us. It is created by the tax regime that surrounds forestry.
default              
defaultGoing back to your point about a reduced price from the Forestry Commission, it is something we would be very interested in talking to them about, but their interpretation of protecting the taxpayers’ interest and in the public interest purely comes down to how much money they can take back into the coffers. They interpret the Treasury rules such that there ha
defaults to be a financial benefit—
defaulta financial value. Although we are talking about providing social and environmental benefits, they do not come into any calculation in relation to the public interest by the Forestry Commission when they are looking at the value of the land. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ146 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I do not know if you are familiar with it, but that is a bit like the Crown Estate’s response
default to these sorts of issues. I see all the members of the panel nodding, but unfortunatel
defaulty that does not get recorded,
default therefore you have to say something.
defaultAndrew Leaverdefault: I am aware of the Crown Estate’s response, but not in detail.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ147 default&#xa0; 
defaultSir James Paice:default 
defaultWith your permission Chairman, I would like to take in some of the other witnesses. 
defaultI would like to turn to Rachael. On this issue, sticking to forestry before we move to wider issues, what made HIE change its position? Was it new rules, new interpretation of rules or individual misunderstanding of rules? What happened?
defaultRachael McCormackdefault: When the Scottish Land Fund was launched in 2012
default,
default we identified a possible maximum intervention rate of 95%, together with colleagues in the Big Lottery and the Scottish Government. When we are talking with communities, whether it is around a Scottish Land Fund application that might be coming forward or an application in relation to any other fund—indeed an application to HIE for support—we would be at pains not to stifle their ambition. It would not be for HIE at an early stage of the conversation to be talking to a community group about whether or not they ought to aspire to a maximum intervention rate.
default 
defaultWe were also not sighted in those early parts of the conversation on some of the detail, which we would need to start to look at when we had a clear idea about the nature of the proposal coming forward. 
default              
defaultAs all of the Committee will be aware, forestry is a primary activity under the legislation. As such
default,
default the state aid rules that apply are pretty clear and pretty well set out. Having said that, those rules apply to commercial forestry. If an application were to come forward from a community organisation with an emphasis, for instance, on amenity, on educatio
defaultn or
default on biodivers
defaultity and nature conservation,
default there are 
defaultother potential
default routes that we can consider.
default Rather tha
defaultn
default preclude the community from being innovative and looking at what it needs and wants
default to put forward to a funder, 
defaultHIE works with community organisations across the region supporting applications to a range of different sources of funding
default. I
defaultt is not for us to direct the community in terms of its areas of focus. Therefore we would not say “go for this intervention rate or that intervention rate
default,
default” other than to say that there is a maximum int
defaultervention rate available and i
defaultt is ultimately predicated on exactly what constitutes not just the parcel of land or assets that you would like to bring forward but the nature of the activity that you intend to take forward on that asset.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ148 default&#xa0; 
defaultSir James Paice:default You said just now that there may be other ways forward. I think those were your precise words. 
defaultRachael McCormackdefault: Depending on the nature of the activity that the applicant is intending.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ149 default&#xa0; 
defaultSir James Paice:default Are you therefore talking outside the Scottish Land Fund?
defaultRachael McCormackdefault: No. For clarity, in t
defaulterms of the activity—whether i
defaultt is economically or educationally focused or biodiversity, nature conservation or general amenity focused—the state aid rules apply to the pure economic activity. It is that commercial issue that presents the challenge. When we are clear on that
default,
default we then interpret the legislation. It is there to be interpreted
default,
default and I have said on a number of occasions in arenas not dissimilar to this one that the regulation is there and we work jolly hard to navigate a path through that suppor
defaultts the level of ambition within
default our communities. 
default              
defaultA similar example in terms of a large-scale commercial forestry application that came forward to HIE, initially in anticipation of a 95% interven
defaulttion rate from the Scottish Land
default Fund, was the Colintraive and Glendaruel community group looking at over 600 acres of land that they were looking to
default acquire with a view to a degree of commercial activity
default, but actually t
defaulthe primary focus for the community organisation was around so
defaultcial benefit. It was around 
defaultpotential woodland crofts and housing and places for local employment, perhaps
default looking at low-car
defaultbon, locally supplied wood fuel;
default but i
defaultn order to b
defaulte able to resource that, there wa
defaults a commercial component tha
defaultt they need
defaulted
default to extract from the
default asset.
default 
defaultIn discussion with ourselves and my expert staff in our community assets team, they approached a private developer with a view to 
defaulta deal that was brokered with
default the private developer who took rights to the timber
default,
default and the intervention rate from the public purse on a £1.55 million asset acquisition was very low indeed.
default              
defaultF
defaultrom
default my point of view—
defaultperhaps this is a particular opinion—
defaultthat
default demonstrates the innovation that can be brought about when we look outside the box and think a
defaultbout best use of public moneys, how we can bring 
defaultinnovation and new opportunities and 
defaultactually 
defaultchallenge the basis on which we come forward to the public purse from an additionality point of view. There were other avenues for that community and they will not be replicable everywhere else, I am quite sure, but it is a good exemplar of the nature of the opportunity that can derive.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ150 default&#xa0; 
defaultSir James Paice:default I am sure it is and I would dearly love to follow it up, but first 
defaultcan I challenge you?
default Perhaps I have misunderstood
default,
default but you seem to be 
defaultalmost 
defaultcontradicting what you said a few minutes ago. With regard to the Aigas issue
default,
default yo
defaultu used words to the effect of “I
defaultt is not for us to advise community groups what to be doing
default.”
default I think that is what you said, or that is what you implied.
defaultRachael McCormackdefault: It is not for us to stifle ambition. It is not for us to put parameters around the nature of the focus for that community
default,
default and the activity that it wants to pursue. 
defaultWhat
default we will be consistent in
default—
defaultAndrew was right in
defaultasmuch as he talked
default about
default organisations having a commercial focus—is that t
defaulthe language 
defaultwe would use is organisations 
defaultbeing
default sustainable and 
defaultorganisations 
defaultnot creating a position where 
defaultthey become dependent on public 
defaultsector subsidy or repeat asks to the public sector purse. A land undertaking is not something that communities
default take
default 
defaultlightly and it is not something that
default 
defaultwe take lightly. Looking at 
defaultlong-term sustainability is really very key.
default              
defaultChair:default defaultLindsay is desperate to come in on an additional point.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ151 default&#xa0; 
defaultLindsay Roy:default You said, 
defaultunderstand
defaultably,
default that your role is not to stifle ambition. It is not to create unrealistic aspirations either.
defaultRachael McCormackdefault: No; you are quite right.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ152 default&#xa0; 
defaultLindsay Roy:default How do you get that balance?
defaultRachael McCormackdefault: We make practical assessment at the earliest opportunity when information is provided. You are absolutely right to draw it out as a difficult line to tread. We have many years’ experience of working with communities
default,
default and 
defaultwe recognise 
defaultabsolutely 
defaultthat 
defaultdaft expectations 
defaultis a painful place to be
default, without doubt; but we
default have expert staff—I mentioned our assets team—and strengthening community staff in our eight a
defaultrea teams across the h
defaultighlands and
default i
defaultslands. One of the defining factors about relationships that organisations such as Aigas have with HIE is a long-term relationship. We would hope that over time that is a trusted relationship, where we are realistic and challenging but 
defaultwe 
defaultare also very encouraging to ensure that communities come forward with confidence and ambition.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ153 default&#xa0; 
defaultLindsay Roy:default I get the impression from Andrew that 
defaultdisillusion wo
defaultuld be a euphemism. Would that be correct?
defaultAndrew Leaverdefault: Yes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ154 default&#xa0; 
defaultLindsay Roy:default What barriers have you faced and what level of trust do you have in HIE?
defaultAndrew Leaverdefault: We have had some very solid and strong working relationships with different members of staff at HIE, some of whom have left. We have 
defaulthad 
defaultdifferent assessors and different contact managers given to us
default, and they are very good, but we have felt that in the last few years HIE a
defaults an o
defaultrganisation 
defaulthave not gi
defaultven clear and succinct advice; t
defaulthey have not given consistent advice. As a community group that has links with other community groups and gets feedback informally from other people, this is a pattern that we seem to be seeing.
default              
defaultWe can talk about HIE, but 
defaultI have to say that one of the issues is how we apply state aid and whether we should be applying it at all, rather than whether the advice from HIE 
defaultwas good or bad. That could be
default “H
defaulte said, she said” 
defaultall day. There is an issue surrounding
default whether state aid should be applied at all.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ155 default&#xa0; 
defaultSir James Paice:default That is the point we are really trying to get to here. It is not just 
defaultfor, in your case, 
defaultthe forestry example that you represent
default,
default but 
defaultfor 
defaultthe wider issues as well. I appreciate that we have now been joined by Mr Dutton from
default DTAS and Mr Ritch from the Lottery—he introduced himself earlier
default. Perhaps others would want to answer this, but 
defaultthe first point has to be, 
defaultfrom information we have already had
default,
default 
defaulthas there
default been any change in the actual regulations on state aid over the last decade or so
default?
default Is anybody aware of that?
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: This is my seco
defaultnd Land F
defaultu
defaultnd, as it were. When operating Land F
defaultund and
default L
defaultottery schemes
default,
default and investing assets
default as well,
default we have sought to navigate that territory. While the fundamental regulation has not changed, what does change a little is the interpretation of that regulation. That is the b
defaultusiness that we are in as grant-
defaultmakers
default,
default and I would say that is the situation Rachael was describing. You need a certain amount of information about a project in order to try to reach a judgment. It is a really difficult balance to strike
default,
default between
default, “This is really exciting and you should do it” and “There will be some bumps in the road and there may be state aid or other regulatory challenges.” 
default              
defaultWhat we have sought to do in every case we have dealt with is support the community to work as effectively as they can to put together the best funding package they can within whatever regulatory framew
defaultork affects i
defaultt. Where there are buildings and capital projects involved there is a whole bunch of regulatory stuff we work through, through capital experts and support contracts. In relation to state aid
default,
default we look to structure project funding as effectively as we can to work within the rules as we understand them
default,
default based on the advice we have
default,
default to support those communities as best we can.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ156 default&#xa0; 
defaultSir James Paice:default Where has this reinterpretation come from that you imply has taken place?
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: I do not think I would go as far as to say it is a reinterpretation. What we try and do is make some difficult judgments.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ157 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I want to be clear. If this is not a reinterpretation, why is it that things that were previously acceptable are no longer acceptable?
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: I do not think it is the case that things that were previously acceptable are no longer acceptable. It is the case that we have had to structure the package in slightly different ways throughout t
defaulthe life of our investment in these
default things. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ158 default&#xa0; 
defaultJim McGovern:default That is a reinterpretation.
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: 
defaultI suppose w
defaulthat I am trying to say is that we have not seen a particul
defaultar new set of rules that said, “D
defaulto things differently”. We have sought to act as effectively as we can within the advice we have. 
defaultTo that extent, w
defaulte have always been aware of the basic state aid tests
default,
default and we apply them to the cases that we need to fund. We then need to react to what the answers to those questions tell us. Sometimes the judgments you make in relation to those questions are different because case law emerges in relation to state aid. It is not always a precise area. It is not a piece of regulation that is well designed for the kind of business we are in, in terms of supporting communities to buy land, so it does become pretty challenging to try and walk a very straight line on it.
default              
defaultSir James Paice:default defaultMr Dutton wants to come in.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ159 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Mr Dutton, since this is the first time you 
defaultwill have spoken,
default perhaps you could introduce yourself. Tell us who you are and what organisation you are working for.
defaultRory Duttondefault: I am Rory Dutton and I work for the Development Trusts Association of Scotland. We are a charitable company with a membership of over 200 community development trusts, which a
defaultre community organisations that
default lead their own regeneration
default,
default including
default some land trusts and 
defaultother community groups.
default              
defaultWe have obviously come across this issue through our membership. My role as a development officer for the north of Scotland is quite often answering queries such as these from members.
default 
defaultThe general point I would make in connection with that is 
defaultthat 
defaultI would not say there has been a change. I have in a previous incarnation been involved in the public sector. In the last few years
default,
default a lot more agencies, public sector organisations and local authorities have become aware of the state aid rules, whereas before they perhaps were not
default,
default or 
defaultthey thought it was 
defaultnot rea
defaultlly relevant to them. They 
defaultbecome aware of it 
defaultat the time, 
defaultand there is not the knowledge within their organisations about what the state aid rules are, certainly at an operating level. They will tend to be 
defaultpretty 
defaultrisk averse—whether it is a local authority, an agency or whoever—and there are very few points of reference or people they can go and speak to in order to get an opinion on that. The Scottish Government’s own state aid unit has traditionally also been quite conservative and risk averse in its interpretation. Even if agency or local authority staff went somewhere else to get opinions, they have all tended to be quite risk averse
default in their interpretation
default. 
defaultAnother point 
defaultis that a lot of the staff 
defaultdo not have the time to do a detailed state aid analysis of each and every application that comes forward. That is partly against the backdrop of not knowing the ins and outs of it. 
default              
defaultWe have two contracts from the Scottish Government, one of which is to do with asset transfer—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ160 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Just to be clear, when you said that staff did not have the time and so on
default,
default I am not quite clear whose 
defaultstaff you are referring to
default. Is that the staff of the individual projects?
defaultRory Duttondefault: For example, there is a fund called the Enterprise Ready Fund that the Scottish Government launched. It is run through contractors. They have deemed all assistance granted through that to be state aid
default,
default because that
default saves them having to spend 
defaulttime analysing whether each case constitutes state aid or not
default,
default and whether it needs to be taken into account by the rules or whether it falls outwith the rules. That is my point. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ161 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Which organisation is that?
defaultRory Duttondefault: 
defaultThe Enterprise Ready Fund. Going
default to the promotional 
defaultevent for that, the point 
defaultwe picked up on was that everything was going to be treated as state aid. There were some groups within the presentation there who were talking about enterprises where there was no local market, far less any involvemen
defaultt of international trading, 
defaultyet any assistance forthc
defaultoming was going to be deemed 
defaultstate aid and subject to the rules. That is the p
defaultoint I am making. There is 
defaultlack of awareness as to what might and might not be state aid
defaults
default. There is not the knowledge or expertise at an operational level within a lot of organisations
default now
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ162 default&#xa0; 
defaultSir James Paice:default Are you talking about at the applicant level or 
defaultare you talking about 
defaultwhoever is providing public funds?
defaultRory Duttondefault: The grantor of the funding. The onus is on them to tell the applicant whether or not this is state aid and whether it will be done through—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ163 default&#xa0; 
defaultSir James Paice:default And your contention is that these different grantor organisations do not all have the skills and knowledge to do that?
defaultRory Duttondefault: That is right. We work with a lot of local authorities. Asset transfer from local authorities to community groups is not something that people have been doing for a long time. It is a new level of activity. Sta
defaultff are coming in to do that who
default have not been doing this sort of thing before, so they are obviously not familiar with the rules. The
defaultre is a big awareness issue
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ164 default&#xa0; 
defaultSir James Paice:default Befo
defaultre we go too far down that road, 
defaultand I am sure colleagu
defaultes will want to come back to it, 
defaultI would like to stick to the wider issue of forest and land purchase, which is the main area the inquiry is looking into. I think
default,
default Rachael
default, that you
default wanted to come back on what has already been said, but 
defaultfrom 
defaultyour perspective has there been any change in the interpretation? Have you had new legal guidance? Has anything changed in the way that you scrutinise applications for money
default, vis-à-vis state aid
default?
defaultRachael McCormackdefault: Our position 
defaultassessing an application coming forward for support for commercial forestry, whatever the source of funding, has not changed. In terms of the legislation, I am sure the Committee is aware that it is a significant field of legislation that comprises state aid and it is dynamic
default, in
default 
defaultas
default 
defaultmuch as i
defaultt is responsive in terms of case law. As cases are tested and found by the Commission, it is that case law which forms a platform going forward in terms of the contemporary interpretation. As with any significant legislation
default,
default there are reference points along the way
default,
default as 
defaulta
default treaty is interpreted over time and as contemporary interpretation is made by the Commission.
default              
defaultWhat we are aware of is the programme of reform that 
defaultthe Commission has
default under
default way 
defaultfrom 2012
default, and information 
defaultcirculated 
defaultas recently as last spring that
default is looking at the ways in which the state aid legislation can be more readily interpreted, more 
defaultreadily 
defaultsupportive of a growth agenda and 
defaultmore readily 
defaultstrengthening local economic markets. We welcome the reform and the trajectory of that.
default 
defaultI do not know whether there is anythin
defaultg that Sandra would like to add.
defaultSandra Dunbardefault: To 
defaultsupplement what bo
defaultth Neil and Rachael have said, w
defaulte have been quite active within HIE to look at emerging case law to help our understanding of how best to interpret the individual activities that take place. As a principle
default, we try to
default maximise 
defaultthe no 
defaultaid argument because we are very conscious that, for example, de minimis levels are very precious to communities. We do no
defaultt
default want to unnecessarily use that, so we have a principle
default 
defaultof trying, 
defaultas far as possible, 
defaultwithin the regulations and the interpretation tha
defaultt is signed, to maximise the no 
defaultaid argument. Conscious of Rory’s point in particular
default,
default we do not take a position that all assistance is by default aid. We try and look at activities on a case-by-case basis
default,
default using the state aid test
defaults, with
default a point of reference in terms of emerging case law. 
defaultAs Rachael sai
defaultd, the modernisation agenda, 
defaultparticularly the notion of aid
default,
default and the Commission’s consultation that came out last week give us some opportunities. There is a reference there to marginal impact
default,
default and that is perhaps an area of opportunity.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ165 default&#xa0; 
defaultLindsay Roy:default How many of these case law interpretations have applied to developments in 
defaultScotland
default?
defaultSandra Dunbardefault: I cannot answer that. As a point of principle
default,
default in terms of the case law that occurs in another member state, there are enough cases that establish case law that would also apply within other member states.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ166 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Both HIE and the Big Lottery Fund spokespeople have referred to taking advice
default—“advice we have had”
default. 
defaultBoth of you referred to that. 
defaultI am not clear from whom you are getting this advice. Is there a guru somewhere that sits in St Andrew’s House or somewhere else who is the dispenser of advice? Rachael, you are claiming it is you.
defaultRachael McCormackdefault: No, absolutely not. We have an in-house expert
default,
default who is sitting behind me. T
defaulthat is what I was gesturing, 
defaultMr Davidson. In the course of the last 12 months
default,
default we have also—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ167 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultSorry. I just want to be clear about t
defaulthe “in-house expert” and “advice we have had
default.”
default If you say “we”, I presume you mean HIE. Therefore if you are getting your expertise in-house, that is not “we have had
default,
default” because “we have had” implies that it is coming externally.
defaultRachael McCormackdefault: May I clarify?
defaultChair:default defaultYes.
default 
defaultRachael McCormackdefault: W
defaulte have also, in the last 12 months, been working with a number of specialist legal advisers
default,
default looking at the case law that is out there and looking at the opportunities that we might be able to induce as a result of precedent that is set elsewhere in other member states, and how we might apply that to the bespoke circumstances that communities come forward to us with. I would stress and reiterate a point that Sandra made about our consistency of approach over time. I can be confident of that in as much as we look at every single case that comes to us in the context of the parameters that are pressing at that point in time. It is a very bespoke proposal that any community brings to us. No two are the same.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ168 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default defaultYou are saying that your advice has been consistent.
defaultRachael McCormackdefault: Yes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ169 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultChair:default defaultAt the very beginning
default,
default you told us that when Andrew Leaver’s group had approached you, you were “not sighted on the detail
default,” which I take it i
defaults a euphemism for not knowing how the thing worked. 
defaultWhat else does not sighted mean? 
defaultThat is manageme
defaultnt-
defaultspeak for what, exactly?
defaultRachael McCormackdefault: It is management-
defaultspeak for a comprehensive plan, in terms of
default the community
default—
defaultChair:default No, no. You were not sighted on the detail: what does that mean?
defaultRachael McCormackdefault: It means that we were not presented, at the point in time of the early discussion—
defaultChair:default No, no. You refer
defaultred
default to yourselves as not being sighted on the detail of the scheme.
defaultRachael McCormackdefault: No, not at all. I apologise if I have not been clear on that point, Mr Davidson. My point was that we were fully sighted, having worked with colleagues to devise some of the parameters that informed the shape of the Land Fund. What we were not sighted on at the time of early discussions with Aigas was exactly what their proposals would be. Would it be overt commercial? Would it be nature conservation?
default&#xa0;
defaultQ170 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultOkay. 
defaultI will check the record and clarify what you said. You are saying that the advice you have had internally
default,
default and have applied
default,
default has always been consistent and has been changed only as a result of case law which h
defaultas been drawn to your attention.
defaultRachael McCormackdefault: Consistent, absolutely, in the process that we go through, which is to look at every individual case that comes forward.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ171 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultNo, no. Sorry. 
defaultConsistent in the process is not the same thing as consistent in the application. I want to be clear about whether or not you believe you have been consistent in the application.
defaultRachael McCormackdefault: I mentioned the nature of community proposals coming forward. 
defaultBecause they
default are unique in terms of their location, 
defaultin terms of their focus and in terms of
default th
defaulteir emphasis, 
defaultthe process that we go through
default—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ172 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultOkay. 
defaultThat
default’s
default a no then. I understand that. 
defaultCan I turn to the Big Lottery?
default Where do you get advice from?
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: Advice to the Big Lottery as a corporate body comes through our legal team, from BIS and Treasury colleagues. In Scotland
default,
default we are also advised by the state aid unit of the Scottish Government.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ173 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Andrew, I can see that you are bursting to come in on this. We are a bit hesita
defaultnt about discussing too much detail about
default one particular project. I understand the reservations that officers of other organisations might have about discussing your project
default, so maybe you could
default bear that in mind.
defaultAndrew Leaverdefault: It is difficult because I am here to represent a project and a typical community example. However, I find that the information Rachael is presenting difficult to sit and stay quiet with. We had had a good relationship with HIE right up to the point of the conversation where they said it was a strong application to the Land Fund. The people we were working with understood our project.
default              
defaultIn addition to that, when we were asked to come in for a meeting and it was explained to us in detail that state aid would be applied, we were not told it was being applied to our project. We were told it was applied to all forestry applications under the Scottish Land Fund
default—all, as in
default a blanket approach to forestry applications in the
default application of state aid. That was the conversation
default I had in the autumn of 
default2012 with members of HIE staff—not w
defaultith Rachael
default,
default but wi
defaultth members of HIE staff—and t
defaulthat does not balance with the information that she 
defaulthas now provided
default to you. I am not saying that we are not both telling the truth
default—I’m not getting at that—b
defaultut this is the first I have heard that they would apply it on an individual basis to individual applications.
defaultChair:default defaultJim, did you want to come in?
default&#xa0;
defaultQ174 default&#xa0; 
defaultSir James Paice:default 
defaultI think you are right: w
defaulte are at risk of going down a very narrow avenue on Aigas, important as it is. 
defaultThere are 
defaulta couple of points on the broader spectrum that I would like to cover before we 
defaultperhaps 
defaultdrill down further.
default              
defaultMoving away from forestry 
defaultto land estate—there have been a number of such community purchases—are there any differences in the way that either of you apply the state aid rules to something like that
default,
default as opposed to forestry? 
defaultThere is the forestry 20% rule. 
defaultYou used the word “primary” industry earlier on, Rachael. Does t
defaulthe
default 20% rule apply to the rest of the 
defaultwhole 
defaultsphere of farming and agricultural estate?
defaultSandra Dunbardefault: Perhaps I can give an example
default.
default              
defaultSir James Paice:default defaultPlease.
default              
defaultSandra Dunbardefault: 
defaultI will not give the name of the organisation
default. It is an example of a Land Fund transaction 
defaultwhere
default we looked at the component 
defaultactivities. That might help to give the Committee some clarity in terms of how we approach the state aid test
defaults
default as they apply to the activities.
default              
defaultIn this instance
default,
default there were four core components of 
defaultthe activity that was assessed 
defaultas going to take place. One was the potential location of a wind turbine, which had the potential to have an economic activity element to it and be commercial. That was assessed to fall under the state aid characteristics
default,
default and therefore we could not give 
defaultit 
defaulta no aid assessment. That was pursued down a private funding route.
default              
defaultThere was a dilapidated steading which was zoned for development. Therefore the potential for state aid around an economic activity was present. We took the view that a 20% SME general block exemption assistance was appropriate in that case.
default              
defaultThere was an element
default of land, which was the most significant in terms of acreage, which was a
default tenanted
default agricultural farm. The view was taken that there was no proposal within a significant period of time for any change to that, so a no aid argument was taken in respect of that element
default,
default and up to 95% funding was potentially available for that element.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ175 default&#xa0; 
defaultSir James Paice:default You decided that 
defaultletting land to a sitting tenant, 
defaulthaving land let was
default not
default—
defaultSandra Dunbardefault: It was already tenanted.
defaultSir James Paice:default But you are saying that is no
defaultt a commercial activity.
defaultSandra Dunbardefault: It was already tenanted
default,
default and the transaction was just to secure the right to that lease. There was no
default additional economic activity. I think the 
defaultterm is around “fruits of ownership”, which has come out by way of guidance from the Commission 
defaultand 
defaultcase law. That was the rationale
default for taking a position 
defaultof no aid in terms of that strand.
default              
defaultThere was also a potential care farm
default, 
defaultwhich was going to be accessible to individua
defaultls with learning difficulties, so t
defaulthere was an educational objective attached to that. That did not get pursued
default,
default but we would have taken a no aid argument on that aspect of activity in terms of no economic ac
defaulttivity. It would have been cost-
defaultneutral.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ176 default&#xa0; 
defaultSir James Paice:default So you broke the whole project down into different bits and decided that some bits were exempt, for one reason or another, from state
default aid and some bits might not be.
defaultSandra Dunbardefault: Yes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ177 default&#xa0; 
defaultSir James Paice:default Therefore you could provide or organise funding for bits of it
default,
default but not for other bits? Have I put that simply?
defaultSandra Dunbardefault: Yes. We looked at the component activities and applied, in an evidence-based way, the state aid tests that are given to us through the Commission.
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: 
defaultThe aim is to get a funding package that works for that project. 
default 
default              
defaultSir James Paice:default defaultRight.
defaultRachael McCormackdefault: Quite importantly there, it was a combination of public lottery and private sector finance that came together to enable that as a basket asset acquisition. 
default&#xa0;
default              defaultChair:default We started 
defaultby 
defaultfocusing solely on you, Andrew, because you had the great advantage
default of being here, but m
defaultany of our initial questions were
default originally intended for Rory, so perhaps we could
default go back to the running order that we devised when we were talking about you all. I will ask Alan Reid to lead off on some of these.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ178 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reid:default The first question is mainly for Rory. What are the main routes for communities who want to take ownership of land and other assets within the
defaultir
default community?
defaultRory Duttondefault: There is obviously the Scottish Land Fund and the Big Lottery. What we are increasingly involved in is the idea of transfer from the public sector and 
defaultfrom 
defaultlocal authorities
default,
default which hold quite a lot of assets, not all of which are being fully utilised for their primary purposes. In our role
default,
default we have not tended to get too involved in forestry or agriculture
default-
defaulttype cases, but we do a lot of work with groups who are taking on assets from the public sector. When you are getting an asset for less than 
defaultwhat is called 
defaultbest consideration
default,
default because of the wider benefits—wh
defaultich 
defaultlocal authorit
defaulties
default certainly can do—that is deemed to be assistance
default,
default because it is a discount on the value, and therefore that can be considered against the backdrop of state aid. 
default              
defaultOn 
defaultyour first point, yes, the main funding if you want to acquire assets such as estates, forestry, et
defaultc.
default, would be the 
defaultsort of things
default we were discussing before
default, but t
defaulthere are other options for smaller assets. Quite a lot of our members will be involved in taking on smaller blocks of land, quite often 
defaultsmall 
defaultbuildings, et
defaultc
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ179 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reid:default As we are finding out, this is all very complicated. Do you find that organisations in communities, particularly in the voluntary sector, have adequate financial legal back-up to navigate their way through all these difficulties?
defaultRory Duttondefault: No, generally not. If they
default are lucky, if they are in the h
defaultighlands 
defaultand
default i
defaultslands maybe, and they have some resources for a development officer, that helps a lot. If they are lucky and get through phas
defaulte one of a L
defaultottery or Land Fund-
defaulttype application and they get funding for development, then that helps a lot. 
defaultBut g
defaultenerally speaking, you are talking abo
defaultut people in their spare time, and t
defaulthey do need to seek professional advice on 
defaultthe 
defaultlegal 
defaultand
default the property side
default, with surveyors,
default valuations and a
defaultll these sorts of things
default. There is a lack of places they can go for little bits of funding to investigate the feasibility of something, to investigate its condition or its market value.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ180 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I understand the difficulties about ordinary community representatives learning the language that bureaucracies utilise. Do you think that a lot of the rules and so on are unnecessarily complicated?
defaultRory Duttondefault: They are not as complicated as they are made to seem; that is true. As far as the broad principles of the state aid
defaults
default debate are concerned, we took time last year to produce our own guide to state aid
defaults,
default so that hopefully if any groups were 
defaultlooking to take on an asset,
default they could 
defaulthave 
defaulttheir own opinion as to what they th
defaultink it may or may not be and 
defaulttherefore be in a better negotiating position. We are not a leg
defaultal authority on it by any means, but w
defaulte can explain the basics of the European regulation and give groups a better basis to negotiate or discuss with a potential donor or transferor of the asset
default,
default or 
defaultwith a 
defaultgrant-awarding body or something like that. Giving organisations a bit of knowledge and confidence in their own knowledge of the topic does not necessarily mean that they can make progress in the negotiations.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ181 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Why can they not make progress?
defaultRory Duttondefault: I probably came in a bit heavy-handed right at the beginning
default, when
default I had just joined
default you
default. 
defaultIn our experience, quite often—
defaultI am not speaking about HIE here in particular or the Lottery
default; I am talking quite generally
default—in the public sector there is not an awarene
defaultss as to the criteria that make
default something subject to the state aid rules or not. The
defaultrefore, the
defaulty will not be able to engage in that deep level of detail in the discussion
default, and therefore you—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ182 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultSorry. 
defaultI am not clear whether you are suggesting that they do not understand the rules themselves 
defaultand/
defaultor whether they understand the rules a bit but they are essentially risk averse and therefore always err on the side of caution. Presumably nobody ever got fired for turning things down, whereas accepting something that 
defaultmay turn
default out later on to have been beyond the rules might be a cause for rebuke.
defaultRory Duttondefault: I
default think i
defaultt is risk aversion because they are not confident on the ground. They are not confident on what the rules say and do not say
default,
default because they have heard lots of stories about court cases. A lot of hearsay is going around as to what might happen if they make a decision.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ183 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Have there been an
defaulty
default court cases in Scotland about this?
defaultRory Duttondefault: Not that I am aware of, no. What we are trying to do is give people a bit of confidence to say, “If it is not an economic activity
default, the
default state aid
defaults don’t
default apply. If it is not subject to local c
defaultompetition in the marketplace, if it’s not subject to
default international trade, then it is not subject to the state aid rules.” We are trying to give people the confidence to argue their case.
default              
defaultI keep going back to the advice to the public sector from the state aid unit within the Scottish Government. Things are changing there now. We have done quite a lot of work with them recently
default,
default and they are revising their interp
defaultretation. I hope it is 
defaultfollowed 
defaultlikewise 
defaultby an awareness throughout the public sector.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ184 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default T
defaulthey are getting 
defaultless restrictive than they were.
defaultRory Duttondefault: My understanding is that at the senior level within the Scottish Government they are keen to have a more enabling role and a more mature attitude to risk and managing risk, et
defaultc
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ185 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default But that is not necessarily replic
defaultated by the other organisations.
defaultRory Duttondefault: I am saying that is a bit down the road.
defaultChair:default There is a time lag.
defaultRory Duttondefault: There is a time lag. We are in the here and now. What we are talking about is something that hopefully will come—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ186 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default It is not often that you find that the guru in the small office, either in 
defaultWhitehall
default or in St Andrew’s House, is more progressive than the people on the ground. It is usually the case that it is the people in the centre that are holding things back. Here you are suggesting that it is possibly 
defaultgoing to be 
defaultthe other way round.
defaultRory Duttondefault: The local groups and ourselves do not go leafing through case law in 
defaultEurope
default or things like that. We loo
defaultk at the regulations and say, “C
defaultommon
default sense would suggest this” or “C
defaultommon sense would suggest that
default.”
default That is the approach our groups will have, which is a negotiating discussion point. We would not expect our members or any other groups to be up on all the case law. That is the approach they are taking. We would hope that the groups could have this two-way discussion about whether there is an
default established local market 
defaultin this activity; is that product or service subject to international trade between member states? Quite a lot of the assets you are talking about are not blatantly or clearly commercial in international trade
default,
default with a commodity. There are a lot of other areas that also fall foul of the rules.
default              defaultChair:default It is always difficult to construct arguments based on common sense if you are trying to persuade Government agencies or public sector bodies.
default Alan, do you want to continue?
default&#xa0;
defaultQ187 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reid:default Is there anywhere you can go for independent legal advice if you find that the Government agency is saying, “No, we don’t want to take the risk here”? Other than the expensive business of paying for your own lawyers, are there any sources you can go to for independent advice without paying a fortune for it?
defaultRory Duttondefault: The default is basically the state aid unit of the Scottish Government. That is the centre of authority, if you like, within 
defaultScotland
default. You will not find many legal practitioners around the country who are familiar with the ins and outs of it. As I said at the beginning, the state aid rules were not seen a
defaults being particularly relevant; t
defaulthey were not 
defaultreally 
defaultnoticed for many
default, many years—
defaultdecades. It is only now that people have started to say, “Hold fire, we do have to take account of these.” The
defaultre has not been that long build-
defaultup of case law. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ188 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default When people did not pay any attention to them there was not a problem. Now that people are paying more attention to them, they 
defaultare 
defaulta problem.
defaultRory Duttondefault: 
defaultIt is that p
defaulteople are now more aware of the existence of these rules and the potential downside where a decision is wrong
default and they were to be challenged.
default As you say, people will want to play safe and will 
defaultwant to be a bit 
defaultrisk averse.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ189 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default H
defaultow many of your organisations have
default been in a situation where a challenge has been made to any state aid that was proposed?
defaultRory Duttondefault: I am not aware of any formal challenge.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ190 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default So we are operating in an environment where no state aid challenge has ever been made to anything in Scotland
default.
defaultRory Duttondefault: I could not say that.
defaultAndrew Leaverdefault: My understanding in terms of community purchase in forestry and land is that there has been no state aid objection and no state aid challenge. I could not say about other economic activity. Therefore the application of state aid did come as a surprise to community groups. You have spoken to Community Land Scotland
default,
default and they have already told you that. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ191 default&#xa0; 
defaultLindsay Roy:default I
defaultn effect
default,
default in Scotland we
default are not testing the boundaries.
defaultAndrew Leaverdefault: No. That is the risk averse comment that Rory has made
default,
default and
default that
default I know has been provided to you previously in different evidence. The feeling is that somebody has cottoned on to this and thought, “
defaultOh, oh, i
defaultt might be a problem so let’s dial
default it
default back and take no risk
default,”
default and then takes it forward. The trouble is that we are not seeing it being taken forward. As community groups we are still seeing a no-risk approach.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ192 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reid:default Who would have the locus to challenge a decision? Would it be a private company that was seen as a competitor, for example?
defaultRory Duttondefault: Absolutely; a competitor. Even now when discussing a project, if somebody sees a community group as having an unfair advantage over their commercial activities
default,
default they will try and have a word with
default, for example,
default the local authority who may be transferring the asset. I can think of an example where the community was told, “It is against state aid rules
default.”
default They were only talking about local competition in a village about their café. It was not anything to do with international trade whatsoever. It is even debatable whether there was any competition
default,
default or 
defaultwhether the market would 
defaultbe big enough 
defaulteasily 
defaultto h
defaultave two or three 
defaultcafés
default anyway, but t
defaulthe local authority in question said, “No, that is against the state rules and you cannot have a community café.”
default&#xa0;
defaultQ193 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reid:default Was there not
default a de minimis of €200,000 where the state aid rules did not apply. Am I correct in that?
defaultRory Duttondefault:
default They could choose to do that, but q
defaultuite often, if you are talking for example about a large old building with some land or something, it does not take lon
defaultg for a community to start 
defaultc
defaultranking—
defaultbuilding it up 
defaultcumulatively. It is a rolling average over three years.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ194 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reid:default It is €200,000 over three years.
defaultRory Duttondefault: It is a rolling total over three years. It is about £167,000 or something like that
default, and yo
defaultu can soon get that
default. If you get a building for £10,000 that was valued at some
defaultthing much higher than that, it’s immediately making it huge. As somebody
default said earlier, people regard de minimis entitlement
default as
default 
defaulta key community asset
default. They do not want to squander that at all.
defaultAndrew Leaverdefault: On the interpretation of state aid, 
defaultI am not an expert by any means, but w
defaulte have spoken to other people who have looked into this in more detail
default,
default such as the representative bodies of Community Woodlands Association and Community Land Scotland. Their understanding as presented to me, and my understanding from Wikipedia, is that EU state aid
defaults require
default distortion of the i
defaultnternational market and require
default something that will affect international trade. You could argue that by introducing a new player to the forestry market there would be a problem, but here we are talking about community forests
default, who
default are harvesting purely to reinvest income into their own activity. Even at Aigas forest, which is 700 acres, we are lucky if we are producing £120,000 worth of timber. Most of that income is then spent on restocking and re-fencing. The amount of money and trade in the European timber market as affected by a community-owned forest is just a drop in the ocean. We just don’t even touch it. That is why we don’t understand why you would apply state aid rules if it is meant to affect trade between member states and to distort the market. We are just not there.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ195 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reid:default Would your trees be going to a 
defaultsaw
default 
defaultmill within Scotland?
defaultAndrew Leaverdefault: Yes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ196 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reid:default Do any other members of the panel have a comment on what
default Andrew said; that it should 
defaultonly apply when it is distorting international trade? Do the other members of the panel have a view on that?
defaultEric Samueldefault: I was going to come back to the previous point. The big investment area 
defaultthat
default we oper
defaultate as the Big Lottery Fund is Growing Community A
defaultssets, which is about transferring assets over to communities. We do have to take state aid into account there as well. Where we run into most problems
default,
default and we have to do quite a bit of negotiation in some cases
default,
default is where there is purely local competition. If there is a co
defaultmmunity café being set up, 
defaultwe need to make sure that any other competitors in that area are quite happy with that. Rather tha
defaultn state aid, these are the sort
default of problems we run up against more often.
default              
defaultAnother UK programme 
defaultwe operate
defaultd was Village SOS, which wa
defaults all about trying to boost social enterprise in rural communities throughout the UK. There was a challenge there in terms of broadband. One of the projects wanted to introduce broadband and there was a challenge. We had to go down to de minimis in that case. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ197 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reid:default That was not a telecommunications company that was object
defaulting. Was it a competitor of the person or a company in the community?
defaultEric Samueldefault: It was in 
defaultEngland
default. I seem to remember it could have been another co
defaultmmunity company that complained
default that they 
defaultwere getting unfair advantage with
default lottery funding.
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: The risk is where people perceive displacement. The state aid complaint process is a really useful step if you want to create that dispute. The question of interference with international markets is a problematic judgment. The guidance from Government states that it is quite a low bar and that you must take cognisance of the potential to impact international markets in making your jud
defaultgment. You 
defaultfind yourself in that rather strange position of asking yourself, “Will a forest of the scale of Aigas really queer the market?” That is the bar at which you need to make the judgment.
defaultAndrew Leaverdefault: I live in a rural community
default,
default and we can understand displacement and local competition.
default I understand that.
default If you h
defaultave a thriving business and
default HIE were to give a grant to a second thriving business and the first one goes out of business and people lose employment, I can understand arguments against that and why HIE would have to consider that. But EU state aid is nothing to do with that. People are using the hammer of EU state aid to crack a nut.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ198 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default We have had briefings on this and we understand the point about a café opening next to anther café.
defaultAndrew Leaverdefault: But they are applying the rules to forestry.
default              defaultChair:default We understand that is a greyer area. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ199 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reid:default I have one further question. If a rival company successfully challenged a transfer, what penalties are then open to the court? Who would the penalty be against? Would it be against the body that awarded the grant? Would it be 
defaultagainst 
defaultthe community group that received the grant? What penalties are available to the court?
defaultEric Samueldefault: My understanding is that it is the project itself. The money would be taken from them. Again, we 
defaulthave an expert here. They 
defaulthave the right to impose interest conditions on that as well. We are very conscious of that. The 
defaultrules are that the 
defaultonus is on the group to make sure that they are not contravening state aid. We do not accept that—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ200 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reid:default 
defaultI
defaultf you make a mistake
default,
default it is not you that suffer
defaults,
default but the project.
defaultEric Samueldefault: It is the project, and that is why we try to get the thing right as much as we can. 
defaultFine, 
defaultBig Lottery Fund could be made to look stupid, but it is the project that suffers at the end of the day and that is what we don’t want.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ201 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default To what extent is that a judgment for them to make rather than you policing it?
defaultEric Samueldefault: 
defaultFor who to make? T
defaulthe project?
defaultChair:default Yes.
defaultEric Samueldefault: It is a difficult one. As I say, the onus is on them and as you have 
defaultrightly
default mentioned
default,
default they would have the right to go and get legal advice. 
defaultIt’s asking a bit much though. 
defaultThat is why we try and get it right on this side
default,
default and make sure they do not have to do that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ202 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default That’s
default right, but if you say to them, “Look, there is an arguable case here that says that would be state aid and if this proceeds you run the risk that somebody will complain and you will be hit with not only having to pay the money back, in which case you would be no worse off than you were before, but 
defaultyou’d also have to pay
default interest” and 
defaultthey say, “Yes, okay then, we’
defaultll take that risk”, what do you then do? Do you say, “Well, no, we are going to decide and we are not going to give you the money anyway”?
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: There is also a risk to the scheme. Your grant scheme can then be closed down.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ203 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Who would close the grant scheme down?
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: There is a requirement of the European Commission that you can close the scheme.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ204 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Is it one hit and you
default’re
default out?
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: It depends on the judgment of the Commission. Not every case that is 
defaultfound to be 
defaultillegal aid results in the scheme closing down, but it can.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ205 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default How many examples are you aware of where schemes have been closed down throughout the 
defaultUK
default?
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: I am not aware of any within the 
defaultUK
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ206 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Throughout 
defaultEurope
default as a whole then?
defaultRachael McCormackdefault: We could certainly provide that information.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ207 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default But
default you are operating on the basis of a sanction which you are totally unaware
default has ever
default been applied anywhere in Europe, and you are substituting your judgment for the judgment of the community groups by saying, “We are protecting you against the possibility that you might end up having to pay interest on this and we are also safeguarding our own position by not taking the risk that by getting one judgment wrong the whole scheme might be shut down.”
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: 
defaultI suppose o
defaultur caution is in relation to the other organisations who could benefit from the scheme. If a scheme is closed down
default,
default we operate other grant schemes. It is a big problem but it is not the end of our organisation. But if that fund is closed down, then every other
default organisation
default—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ208 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Yes, 
defaultthat’s right, 
defaultbut this is a sanction that has never been applied in the UK as far as you are aware. In fact, you are not aware of any occasion when it has ever been applied in 
defaultEurope
default. Yet you are quoting it to us as being a reason why you do not take any risk.
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: T
defaulthe nature of the advice to us in making our judgment
defaults
default about that risk
default is t
defaulthat is what 
defaultcould happen. You are right;
default I do not have that awareness.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ209 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Who has given you that advic
defaulte about the sanctions that can
default be applied? Is that the Scotland
default Of
defaultfice?
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: The potential 
defaultsanctions 
defaultare advised by both the state aid unit of the Scottish Government and by BIS.
defaultSandra Dunbardefault: To endorse what has been said by my colleagues in terms of the potential penalties, they extend beyond the recovery of the aid plus interest 
defaultfrom the recipient; th
defaultere is also the
default threat of
default legal action 
defaultbeing 
defaulttaken by a competitor
default,
default and 
defaultof 
defaultdamages, so there is potentially a furt
defaulther penalty on the recipient in
default challenges to the scheme.
default              
defaultWe can come back further on this, but I think there was a case in Shetland where the allocation of resources was initially deemed not to be state resources. It was to do with funding that came from oil revenues. It was deemed initially not to be state resources but then found to be state resources. That resulted in a recovery of the element that was deemed to be illegal aid.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ210 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default What then happened to the organisation involved?
defaultSandra Dunbardefault: I couldn’t
default comment on that, but we will try and get some further information. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ211 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default What do you mean by 
default“
defaultcouldn
default’t comment
default”
default?
defaultSandra Dunbardefault: I am not aware of the details, but the issue was around the initial assessment that the resources were not state res
defaultources and therefore not aid. They were
default subsequently deemed to be state resources because the allocation was under the control of a state organisation. We can provide further information, but my understanding was that there was a recovery from the recipient
defaults
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ212 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default That would be helpful to clarify it. We have now identified one case in Scotland
default—ever—where there has been recovery. I
defaults that correct?
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: The judgment
default in relation to Shetland Council
default’s
default charitable trust and Shetland 
defaultLeasing and Property
default company was to do with the purchase of fisheries
default quota.
defaultQ213 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Sorry, is this the same one?
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: Yes. There was a further judgment around the purchase of a 
defaultfailing 
defaultfish factory which did not lead to—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ214 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default But it all comes back to the one question of whether or not this was state aid and whether or not it was controlled by the state. I can see that that is a slightly different issue. I want to explore this question and ask Rory about it. It does seem to me that the organisations who are dealing with the distribution of the money are 
defaultsubstituting their judgment; they are 
defaultmaking a judgment on your behalf, as it were, to avoid you being in danger of having the money taken off you and sanctions applied.  Would your organisations
default,
default in some circumstances
default,
default be willing to take that risk?
defaultJim McGovern:default Chair, just before we move on, in response to the answers from previous witnesses
default,
default are you holding up the fact that no sanctions have ever been applied as evidence
default that
default it has been a huge success?
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: 
defaultYou can attribute anything to it, but 
defaultI think what most people advising in the field would say is that it is evidence of the success of the cautionary approach, but there is an opportunity cost of that
default,
default without a doubt
default,
default in terms of the restriction you create by being cautious in that way. I am aware of that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ215 default&#xa0; 
defaultJim McGovern:default The threat of sanctions prevents anybody 
defaultfrom 
defaultdoing anything that might attract sanctions.
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: It fetters how you make 
defaultthe 
defaultjudgments.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ216 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default There is a balance to be struck
default,
default and that is the issue I want Rory to clarify. Do you feel, on behalf of your organisations, that they are being hyper
default-
defaultcautious
default,
default and that th
defaultere is an element of risk 
defaultthat some of your organisations would be willing to bear? 
defaultSorry, nodding doesn’t get recorded.
defaultRory Duttondefault: 
defaultNo, we forget. 
defaultAbsolutely. I have not seen all the case law, but the communities will have thought about it. That is the thing about communities; when they do so
defaultmething they have researched it. They have
default thought about it and worked it out in a lot of detail in their own 
defaultand 
defaultvolunteers’ time. Communities will often say, “There is no way that will ever be challenged. There is no way that concerns international and there is no way that should be state aid.” They are clearly prepared to take the risk that is seen by the awarding 
defaultagency
default.
default              
defaultThere is a fair point that the gentleman on the end made about the risk to others if the thing is closed down. That is worth bearing in mind. I would say that most communities who have a big issue with a state aid decision are pretty confident that it is not an issue, and they would be taking a risk.
default              
defaultGoing back 
defaulta wee bit 
defaultto the responsibilities, I may be wrong but I seem to remember that there is an onus on the people giving financial assistance to let the community know it is being done through de minimis
default,
default so that they know to add it to their rolling total. I have 
defaultheard—
defaultI have not researched 
defaultit to check
default if it is true—that there have been some retrospectives: “Oh, by the
default way, the money you got at such 
defaulta
defaultnd 
defaultsuch a time was de minimis too
default,
default” and groups suddenly find that this precious asset of a de minimis entitlement is fuller than they thought
default it was. That is something
default I hope is not happening
default,
default but I have heard reports that that may have been happening. 
default              
defaultThe buck does stop with the community group. They lose the money a
defaultnd they may get interest, but 
defaultthere is an onus on the awarding agency
default, I think,
default to notify the community group that it is being awarded under de minimis rules. That may have been happening for the likes of HIE but—
default              defaultChair:default 
defaultThere are practicalities. 
defaultI am conscious that some of this is certainly devolved anyway. Therefore the detailed operation
defaults,
default about informing and so on
default, do
default not seem 
defaultto me 
defaultto be one of the str
defaultategic issues we want to 
defaultaddress ourselves to 
defaultunduly 
defaulthere. It is this question of who bears the risk
default,
default and then potentially the penalty. I want to explore that a little more.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ217 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reid:default There is one area I wanted to pursue 
defaulton
default forestry. It was either Andrew or Rory who said earlier that there are tax benefits to a private owner that do not apply to a community group. When working o
defaultut whether state aid applies, is
default the awarding body allowed to take into account the fact that the community group is not getting the state aid of tax benefits and subtract that from the state aid that you do get? Is that a possible route?
defaultAndrew Leaverdefault: I will make a comment although, to be fair, somebody else needs to answer the question. One thing 
defaultthat 
defaultstruck me on that ta
defaultx benefit thing
default is that t
defaulthe reason that
default forestry prices 
defaultare 
defaultinflated
default, apart from the 
defaultvalue of tax benefits to private owners in particular, but even to commercial owners
default, 
defaultwhat we found that it
default is 
defaultalso 
defaulta different interpretation
default—I’m looking for the
default words. 
default   defaultWhat we are also confused about is 
defaultwhere there is
default transfer of ownership of a forest. The amount of timber you take out will not be altered by the transfer of ownership. It will grow at the rate it grows
default,
default and it will be harvested when it is due to be harvested. The value of the market at the time will pay that value. The transfer of ownership itself will not affect the amount of timber extracted or the value of that timber, which is where it hits the market
default—the extractive market. There is a double issue
default. One is, do they take into account the fact that we do not have the same tax benefits and therefore we ar
defaulte paying over what we would pay?
default Also, because the timber does not change in value just because the ownership is transferred, 
defaultwhy again is that affecting
default the market?
default&#xa0;
defaultQ218 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default There are two issues there.
defaultAndrew Leaverdefault: There are, I’m afraid. I was bringing in something.
default 
defaultChair:default 
defaultI had not quite thought of looking at the question of tax benefits to private owners in the context of state aid and therefore maybe ruling them out on that basis. That is certainly something that we will explore further. On the point about forestry, I had thought, maybe mistakenly, that much of the thrust behind community ownership was to utilise potential assets which were not presently being harvested, marketed or developed and so on. Therefore there was the creation of economic activity rather than just simply a transfer of ownership from one to the other. Presumably if it is a transfer of ownership from the public sector to a community group, then 
defaultthat, if it is viable, could be
default funded 
defaultcommercially 
defaultand need not require funding from HIE or the lottery or anybody else.
defaultAndrew Leaverdefault: Aigas is slightly different from some other forestry groups
default,
default but the principle is the same. The trees were planted 50 years ago and they are near maturity. Somebody will need to harvest them, whether it is the Forestry Commission or whoever. They have deemed the land surpl
defaultus so the Forestry Commission are
default unlikely to be the harvesting 
defaultbody. If we do not buy it,
default they will sell it on the private market. The private owner, whether it is a commercial forestry or a private owner, will need to harvest those tree
defaults. You cannot leave them;
default they will fall down. Somebody will harvest those trees, whether it is us or somebody else.
default              
defaultThe transfer of ownership itself will not affect the value of the timber that is taken out. All it is doing by giving us the grant to purchase it is providing the community with the opportunity to make some money out of that forest instead of a private owner. Somebody is going to make the same amount of money. It is going to hit the market at roughly the same time and give roughly the same value of timber, regardless of the owner. Again that goes back to why apply state aid to that particular transaction.
default              defaultChair:default I think I understand why.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ219 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reid:default Could we have a comment from the Lottery? We have heard that there are tax advantages to the private sector that do not apply to the community sector. Are you allowed to take the tax disadvantages that the community group has into account when working out if the grant is state aid?
defaultEric Samueldefault: We would not fund the private sector u
defaultnder the Land Fund or
default—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ220 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reid:default No; you would not fund the private sector
default,
default but we have heard that the private sector has tax advantages and the community group has tax disadvantages
default,
default but they get a grant. Are you allowed to subtract the tax advantage that a private owner would have from the grant when working out whether this is state aid or not?
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: To work out a balance?
defaultMr Reid:default Yes.
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: It would depend on a whole range of factors. In essence
default,
default we would have to make a judgment on the amount of money we are paying and is it within de minimis or not. You cannot net off the pros and cons, as far as we understand it, and we do not do that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ221 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reid:default Have you had legal advice to that effect?
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: No, but we could seek advice on that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ222 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reid:default Could you seek that and write to us, please?
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: We will certainly raise that with our legal people.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ223 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default You have not done that before? I am just surprised that that question should be asked and you responded by saying, “Look, we have not thought of that” or “We have not considered that previously.”
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: If there were a very obvious option there
default,
default our lega
defaultl team would have identified i
defaultt, but at this point they have not.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ224 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reid:default The point has been made that the reason the community group need a grant is the tax benefits to the private sector. If those tax benefits were not there for the private sector
default,
default the value would be a lot lower and the community group probably would not need a grant. They only need a grant because of the tax advantages. It seems that everything is stacked in favour of the private sector here.
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: The majority of grants that we make to communities to buy property
default are
default relatively small
default on average
default. The original Scottish Land Fund made 117 grants. If you take out four very large ones, the average size is £35,000 so you are well below that kind of level. It is not a particularly common situation for us.
default&#xa0;
default              defaultChair:default 
defaultTo be fair to ourselves, I think we understand that; 
defaultthere is a difference between helping a community to buy a hut to turn it into something, which is very small, and a rural community who want to buy a big chunk of land. Given that our inquiry is on land reform, we are focusing on the land reform elements of it. I will move on to Mike to pick up the third question.
default That’s the third out of about 97. I’ve got another meeting at 11.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ225 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default Before I move on to the third question
default, I want to back up 
defaultthe question Alan was asking. Various different assistances are available to private owners that would form state aid, like feed-in tariffs, renewable obligation certificates, forestry grants and farming subsidies. Are all of these things ever looked at in the calculation of whether it is possible to move across to community ownership rather than a private ownership when you are considering the applications?
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: A range of those benefits are available to community owners too. If you take assistance to renewable energy projects, for example, we have had situations where communities have been funded
default,
default and they chose then to change their funding arrangements from a grant from us to feed-in tariffs, 
defaultbecause that
default offered them a better long-term income stream. It depends on the project and the organisation and what they are trying to do.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ226 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default But you can understand where the question is coming from. We are looking at why state aid 
defaultis a barrier, or 
defaultseems to be a barrier
default,
default for communities 
defaultto buy 
defaultup 
defaultland when, at the same time, the private landowner is already able to access funds 
defaultthat
default are effectively state aid.
defaultRachael McCormackdefault: 
defaultMay I contextualise? 
defaultSince 1997
default,
default HIE has supported 167 community asset acquisitions
default,
default and over 311,000 acres of land is in the ownership of communities during that same period.  I want to put 
defaultthose numbers on the table as 
defaultbalancing statistic
defaults
default. The barrier is the extent to which the land or asset has the potential to affect international trade. When we are talking about commercial forestry in isolation, as opposed to any other sort of land acquisition, it is very specifically prescribed within the treaty. There are very clear guidelines in terms of what can and cannot be done.
default              
defaultOur starting point in any state aid discussion is to maximise a no aid position. There are a number of examples
default,
default and I am happy to give the Committee a specific example which might illustrate the rationale of an individual bespoke a
defaultpproach to the assessment. A
defaultn activity s
defaultupporting 
defaultdevelopment of industrial units for local employment, which if we were to do it in Oban or in Inverness would demonstrably create displacement, would have an impact and would not be eligible for aid. We have supported a community in West Harris to the tune of £154,000
default, based on a no 
defaultaid argument that looks at the history of land ownership
default, the availability of land
default and the activity within the market. We have taken advice from property specialists
default,
default 
defaultand made a strong and robust no 
defaultaid argument to support that community to drive forward its ambition. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ227 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I
default’m sorry;
default I
default don’
defaultt quite understa
defaultnd the wording. What does a “no 
defaultaid argument” mean?
defaultRachael McCormackdefault: That we have looked at every angle of the project
default, we have looked at every angle of 
defaultthe proposal and we have satisfied ourselves
default,
default 
defaultbased on the
default evidence-based approach which HIE takes
default,
default that we can fund that but it would not constitute a state aid.
defaultChair:default defaultWe have to vote and we will be back as quick
defaultly
default as we can. I have been told that there are two votes
default,
default so if you don’t mi
defaultnd talking among yourselves, 
defaultwe’ll be back as soon as we can.
default&#xa0;
defaultSitting suspended for Divisions in the House.
default&#xa0;
defaultOn resuming—
default&#xa0;
default              defaultChair:default I understand that so
defaultme of you have to leave early, so w
defaulte will try and rattle through some of the other questions and answers, if you do not mind. If there are other issues
default that we want to explore
default,
default we may
default write to you
default about some of them
default. We appreciate that we often have a difficulty with people coming down from 
defaultScotland
default. We do not have facilities available to us in Scotland
default with
default broadcasting opportunities. This will go on the internet for those who wish to watch it late at night and then send comments at 
default3
default in the morning
default, which we often get.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ228 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default You will be glad to hear that we are moving away f
defaultrom state aid for a short while, and looking
default more at the general community right to buy. I would like to ask Rory first of all because it generates from the e
defaultvidence that you submitted, which
default really dealt with the community right to buy. It only allows communities in Scotland with a population of 10,000 to apply t
defaulto register an interest in land—effectively rural areas. 
defaultFor example, in the constituency that I represent
default,
default the vast majority
default of
default 
defaultit 
defaultwould not fall within the map
default; I have had a look at the map
default. Yet there are issues 
defaultinvolved in urban areas where 
defaultcommunity right to buy might provide quite a good solution. Why was community right to buy limited to rural areas
default,
default and what impact do you think it would have if it was made universal?
defaultRory Duttondefault: Obviously
default,
default I cannot speak as to wh
defaulty it was limited to rural 
defaultin the first place. 
defaultCertainly, w
defaulte do a lot with urban
default, as well as with rural
default. To have a universal community right to buy—whether it is rural or urban, public or private land—whatever the community size
default,
default would make a lot of sense. I am not talking about vast tracts of land
default,
default but there are a lot of key small bits of land, perhaps a building or whatever, which would make a huge difference to urban communities. My understanding is that if you look at the latest discussion paper coming out from the Scottish Government on the Community Empowerment Bill
default, there is a strong hint 
defaulton the universality of the community right to buy. They are certainly looking at using that mechanism to have an appropriate community right to buy for urban as well as rural areas.
default              
defaultThere are other issues of course. Even with a population of 9,000 in a town, to get 10% in a ballot is a huge challenge. That would be amplified more and more as you went into large
defaultr
default population centres. It is not a question of simply opening it up; you would have to tune it as well.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ229 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default I would be interested in knowing if the others
default, as the funding mechanism for that, 
defaultsee any problems with making that more universal
default.
default 
defaultEric Samueldefault: We have been funding urban communities as well as rural communit
defaulties since 2006. The thing with Growing Community A
defaultssets is that it is not reliant on people making use of community right to buy. The vast majority, as happened in the Land Fund, are negotiated settlements between the buyer and seller. 
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: Roughly £60 million has been invested through the phases of the GCA
default; about
default 65% is in rural 
defaultScotland
default and 35% in urban 
defaultScotland
default. You are talking in the range of £25 million since 2006 invested in urban assets. As 
defaultRory
default mentioned, they are usually fairly strategic small parcels of land.
default              
defaultThe challenge is often around things like valuation and the relative value of urban land in some se
defaultttings
default. 
defaultAs Rory said, t
defaulthe idea of how you measure community support does need tuning in that context. With a larger population base
default,
default a 10% threshold becomes a much greater challenge. In a more dispersed population
default,
default it is sometimes a harder thing to put together. We find that communities are able to do that
default,
default because within our funding programme we can be more flexible and less prescriptive.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ230 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Am I right in thinking that the south of 
defaultScotland
default, right across the country, has been less active in pursuing the opportunities than the north of 
defaultScotland
default? You ten
defaultd to associate the h
defaultighlands and
default i
defaultslands and so on with the idea of community land buy-outs rather than the south of Scotland.
defaultEric Samueldefault: Through the Land Fund certainly, but not in terms of GCA. Dumfries and 
defaultGalloway
default got quite a few award
defaults
default through going—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ231 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Sorry; 
defaultGCA?
defaultEric Samueldefault: Gro
defaultwing Community Assets. That is the
default Big Lottery Fund programme for transferring assets. It depends what you are talking about. When you say “land”, are you talking purely land? In terms of assets—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ232 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default This is an inquiry into land reform rather than an inquiry into you.
defaultEric Samueldefault: But we 
defaultneed to get that clear when we are talking about these things.
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: It is fair to say that it originates in the 
defaultnorth-west and the west h
defaultighlands
default. In the 
defaultwest h
defaultighland
defaults
default, y
defaultou see
default 
defaultthe 
defaultbigger areas of land bought
default—the more iconic areas of land—
defaultand some of the real trailblazers were there. We have seen that ripple out a bit. Particularly in this iteration of the Land Fund
default,
default we have seen significant activity starting to hap
defaultpen in the south of 
defaultScotland
default,
default right down in the Isle of Whithorn, for example, 
defaultJohnstonebridge. 
defaultWe have had quite a few in Dumfries and 
defaultGalloway
default of late. Yes, there
default has been less activity in the b
defaultorders across
default Dumfries and Galloway, south
default Lanarkshire and up into Fife than 
defaultyou would see in the h
defaultighlands and
default i
defaultslands, without a doubt. You have stron
defaultg variety within the h
defaultighlands and
default i
defaultslands as well, so the Western Isles are hugely active
default,
default and Orkney and Shetland much less so. There is a range of factors.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ233 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default I want to press Rory on what he has heard about the possibility of this universal right to buy coming in. Having looked at the consultation that was issued for the Community Empowerment Bill, it certainly has a section 
defaulton
default measures to streamline and extend, but it refers to the rural community right to buy. I do not see any pointer in there heading towards a more universal right to buy.
defaultRory Duttondefault: I will come back on that. I th
defaultought it was mentioned in
default the latest discussion papers but I will have a look at it. It is certainly being talked about and we are very hopeful that it will be
default considered
default. On the rural versus urban, the issues in urban are different in as much as the
defaultre is the
default whole issue of dereliction and not being used
default—of 
defaultland banking. I can think of loads of examples where a key asset in a community has been lying idle and 
defaulthas deteriorated
default. It would be a phenomenal asset for the community
default,
default but somebody is banking it and waiting for the g
defaultood times to come again; 
defaultthey might develop it and sell it on. I would say that in an urban context the whole issue of land banking f
defaultor housing
default—waiting until things pick up and 
defaultrenovating a hotel 
defaultinto flats
default—
defaultis a bigger issue than it is in rural areas. It would make a big difference if it was extended to an urban situation.
default              
defaultAs somebody said earlier, 
defaultcommunity right to buy has not resulted in a lot of direct transactions using the legislation that is there in the background. We would hope that an improved community right to buy would be more useful, whether it is in the urban circumstance of 
defaulta key asset 
defaultwith a lot of potential 
defaultbeing derelict, 
defaultor whether it 
defaultis 
defaultthe absolute right to buy that people talk about to force a sale. That would be part of the evolution.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ234 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default It is also 
defaultsometimes the removal of 
defaultblight in urban situations, where an area is being allowed to go to rack and ruin. The community around about it would love to buy it, just to cut the grass.
defaultRory Duttondefault: Currently, if it was modelled on the current right to buy, they would have to wait until it came on the market. It is not going to come on the market. You can think of examples whe
defaultre it is just sitting there 
defaultdeteriorating and going to rack and ruin. That is both in 
defaultpublic sector and in private
default sector assets.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ235 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default We want to explore what could be done to prevent state aid rules from impeding increased community ownership. We have already covered quite a lot of that. Rory and Andrew, is it fair to say there sh
defaultould be greater clarity, that we
default want a more permissive system of community development and that those involved in administering this scheme 
defaultcould be greatly 
defaultless risk averse? Is that a fair synopsis or is there anything else you think we should add?
defaultRory Duttondefault: There is a further aspect I want to raise. Community enterprises and groups are lumped in with the private sector as commercial enterprises, whereas a lot of communities see th
defaultemselves as very local and small scale—
defaultpublic sector; it is just public ownership on a very small local scale. Yet in all their transactions vis-à-vis state aid
defaults
default and other things they are seen to be just like any other private operator. 
default              
defaultA couple of years ago
default, we 
defaultsuggest
defaulted
default that there might be scope for having a new approved scheme. The European Union can ap
defaultprove schemes; for example, the particular project we were involved in at the time for asset transfers from local authorities to community groups, etc.
default It is just to explore it a bit further
default—that’s the public sector, that’s the private sector and the 
defaultcommunity sector is in the middle. A lot of people in the communities see themselves as being the local public sector.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ236 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default G
defaultreater recognition of the communi
defaultty development aspect of all this:
default is that a fair way of putting it?
defaultRory Duttondefault: Yes. 
defaultAnd there would be 
defaultscope therefore to have specific schemes drawn up so you would not have to go through de minimis. If it was state aid, that is fine and it could go through that scheme. It would have to be quite tightly drawn up, but we believe there is scope to have new schemes as well. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ237 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default We have obviously been critical of other organisations in terms of being risk averse and the like. Given what we are trying to achieve and what could be done to prevent state aid rules from impeding increased community ownership, the sort o
defaultf points that I mentioned 
defaultin terms of greater clarit
defaulty, more recognition of community development and guidance being given to organisations like yourselves to be less risk averse—
defaultthat’s right isn’t it? Yes. Less risk averse.
default              defaultJim McGovern:default To be more risky.
default              defaultChair:default Yes. That is the sort of thing I want to avoid saying. Are there
default other
default recommendations that you think we should be making about how this is handled? Perhaps you could consider it and come back to us about it, because I am conscious that you want to get away.
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: There are a couple of 
defaultimportant 
defaultpoints to make on that. We have been trying to be clear on this for a long time and trying to find ways of supporting communities to buy assets. Between us
default,
default we have invested about £75 million 
defaultin over
default 300,000 acres of land coming into community ownership. That has largely been through willing sellers and negotiated sales at market value. To that extent
default,
default anything that helps us do that
default,
default we would thoroughly welcome
default,
default because that is the business we are in. We are always trying to balance a whole range of factors, which we have previously discussed.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ238 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Do you accept th
defaulte point that was made earlier
default about the aid
defaults
default and assistance given to the private sector having lifted the market value of land quite considerably?
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: I do not know enough about land valuation to give you a worthwhile view on that. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ239 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Having looked at international comparisons, certainly I am aware of some circumstances in A
defaultfrica where it is willing buyer
default and willing seller, but because few of the sellers
default a
defaultre willing—nobody wants to let go of the land—the price of anything that is available just rockets up because of scarcity
default,
default as well as the question of artificial financial assistance. Andrew, do you want to add to that?
defaultAndrew Leaverdefault: I will not quote all the stuff, but we have district value
defaultr
default reports on our purchase and another purchase on the west coast, which clearly state that the value of the forestry land is inflated above its economic value because of the tax benefits and the perceived ownership—the vanity benefits of ownership. That is in a report produced by a valuer.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ240 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default If we do not already have that, then maybe we could have it. I spot a possible witness. 
defaultCould I have some
default further clarification from you
default? It is about
default this question of whether or not the risk of the state aid rules being invoked could be minimised by one community organisation buying the land and a different community organisation then financially develop
defaulting it. If that can be done,
default that looks like a pretty obviou
defaults way of dealing with this. 
defaultRory, is that something that you have been exploring?
defaultRory Duttondefault: I am not familiar enough with the detail. There is quite a complicated thing about whether it is different organisations or whether it can be trading subsidiaries. Quite a lot of the community organisations will have a charitable parent company
default that
default will own the asset, and 
defaultthen there will be 
defaulttrading subsidiaries
default—wholly owned
default companies
default—
defaultwho will run the trading activities on that. I am not knowledgeable enough
default to know how i
defaultt relates to that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ241 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I will ask those who look at t
defaulthese things more closely than us
default, meaning Rachael and Neil. Is that a way forward?
defaultRachael McCormackdefault: Rory has mentioned how that might be interpreted. You would have to look at it through the lens of whether or not there is a relationship and whether it is a
defaultn
default 
defaultovert 
defaultway to manipulate the legislation and find a route through to get to an end, to circumnavigate or take a particular interpretation of the legislation to get to where you want to go. It is certainly something that we would be happy to take away and look at.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ242 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Has nobody ever thought of this before? 
defaultRachael McCormackdefault: Yes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ243 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default We have come to this relatively recently
default,
default and it has occurred to us. Surely you must have co
defaultnsidered this.
default Are there exampl
defaultes where you have one community-
defaultstructured organisation buying 
defaultthe land 
defaultor owning the land and then something else operating it in order to avo
defaultid the state aid rules? A
defaultvoid as distinct from evade, you understand, since avoidance is legal and evasion is not. Your adviser in the background is nodding
default,
default so that is obviously a point of which the organisation is aware. 
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: Historically
default,
default some of those structural solutions have been used and in particular cases they may be helpful, but as Rachael is saying
default,
default in the end the overt gaming o
defaultf the rules is just that and 
defaultnot appropriate in that sense.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ244 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Who decides it is not appropriate?
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: In the sense that if you are completely overtly seeking to game the rules, that seems excessively risky.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ245 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default To whom?
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: Ultimately to the organisation.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ246 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default No; who decides that that is too risky?
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: I suppose we decide that
default,
default because in the end we have to be comfortable with the structural solution
defaults
default that—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ247 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I
defaultt comes ba
defaultck to you being too risk averse.
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: That would be one interpretation.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ248 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default But on something like that you have not gone off to consult the wee man in St Andrew’s House or anything; you have made that decision yourselve
defaults.
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: 
defaultI think a
default number of organisations have sought advice on that and have looked at those structural solutions. They have not come back to us saying that that is what they want to do. It is a wee while since we have had a case that sought to go down that route, to be honest.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ249 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default It strikes me that both organisations are insufficiently entrepreneurial. I get the impression that you are not trying to find ways of helping the community to achieve the things they want to do. You have retreated behind an assumption that if you do som
defaultething wrong, 
defaultsomebody somewhere is going to jump
default on your head. Is that unfair? You
default can understand, having listened to what you have said today, how 
defaultI
default could come to that conclusion.
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: What I would say is that in the past 10 years
default,
default we have managed to achieve substantial investment in a large number of organisations. We have not done that by trying not to help people.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ250 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Your job is essentially to give money away, as I understand it.
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: Yes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ251 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultRight. 
defaultI would have thought that you would be able to manage that. The question then is whether or not that should be the criteria by which you get judged. I am sure you get more requests for your money than you have money to give away.
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: Yes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ252 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default The question is whether or not you are hiding behind difficulties in order to disadvantage particular sets of applicants. In these circumstances it is those who are applying for community land buy-outs and so on, because you are just saying, “This is difficult. We have somebody else that we can give the money to
default,
default so we will meet our target and tick the box in terms of money out the door”, but it 
defaultis not necessarily to those I suspect 
defaulteither the Scottish Government or ourselves would want to prioritise.
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: If you look at our programmes, our assisted community land and asset purchase, the success rate 
defaultin those grant programmes 
defaultis significantly higher than the average grant programme across the board for the Big Lottery Fund. It is something like 80% in the original Scottish Land Fund and upwards of 80% in Growing Community Assets. I do not think it is the case that we are necessarily rejecting large numbers of applicants. We do have
default a challenge on
default state aid and we absolutely recognise that. That may mean that some projects that we could either fund more generously or fund in the first place have been disadvantaged, but generally I do not think it is the case that as an organisation we have set out to avoid funding any particular asset class.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ253 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default In the past
default,
default the Scottish Land Fund gave millions of pounds to Gigha and the South Uist Estate. How does that comply with state aid rules? Would you allow that now?
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: Yes. We funded the Pairc
default Estate last week.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ254 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default That took a very long time, did it not?
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: It took a long time to go through the courts in terms of 
defaultthe 
defaultuse of the right legislation and in terms of the community achieving it with the owner. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ255 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Y
defaultou would say t
defaulthat was not a delay at your end.
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: No.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ256 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I want to 
defaulttry and 
defaultclarify this. If Gigha and South Uist came up today, you would do them again, would you?
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: We would fund Gigha and South Uist again, yes. When we funded both Gigha and South Uist we considered whether or not there were state aid issues with those acquisitions.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ257 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Given the size of them and their 
defaultfair amount of 
defaultsignificance, if anything comes forward from Rory’s organisation or somebody similar th
defaultat fits the same template, 
defaultt
defaulthat should proceed quite easily.
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: Subject to all the usual assessment and everything else, but yes.
defaultChair:default In principle.
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: Yes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ258 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default That 
defaultis very helpful. D
defaulto you want to respond to the points I made about yourselves being insufficiently entrepreneurial and helpful?
defaultRachael McCormackdefault: I was just going to say that another context for that would be 
defaultbeing 
defaultcommitted to working within the legislation. We work extremely—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ259 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default But this is within the legislation as you interpret it. Again it comes back
default to the point about being hyper-
defaultcautious. Rory, are your organisations happy with the people you are dealing with and the views that they are applying in these circumstances?
defaultRory Duttondefault: We are very unhappy with some decisions. I would say things are moving reasonably fast now, so hopefully things will get better.
defaultChair:default Things can only get better.
defaultRory Duttondefault: Our members have not been happy, no; they have been very unhappy in certain examples. That is clearly why we have been involved with Ministers in the Scottish Government, with senior civil serv
defaultants, with the Local Government and Regeneration C
defaultommittee and with the Community Empowerment Bill. A
defaultll these processes we have fed into
default the issue as well.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ260 default&#xa0; 
defaultLindsay Roy:default Can you indicate why people have been unhappy?
defaultRory Duttondefault: People have been unhappy generally
default,
default because this whole issue about state aid has appeared recently and is seen to be an obstacle to them realising their ambitions for their communities. I am not speaking specifically about HIE here. I am just speaking generically about the public sector when they are dealing with state aid
defaults
default and community groups. They do not feel they can have that one-to-one dialogue to progress the issues, talk round them and negotiate an agreed position, or if there is any scope to move. I cannot comment at all on the Aigas case. I am not involved in that at all. Generally there is an increasing number of phone calls I get—put it that way—from people who are frustrated with state aid issues.
default              
defaultI would like to go back to the point we were debating a minute ago vis-à-vis Storas Uibhist and South Uist
default. That is the
default trading company. Sealladh na Beinne Moire is the charitable parent th
defaultat owns the asset. That is well 
defaultestablished among development trusts and land trusts. You have a charitable parent and then you have the trading activity done by a non-charitable trading share company. The charity regulator in Scotland, OSCR, is similarly concerned
default,
default as HMRC 
defaulthave been, 
defaulton the tax issues of charities, et
defaultc
default. It is quite a well established thing to have this charitable parent and trading activities, but you do not want to set that up for a relatively small project. As I said, I am not aware of the ins and outs of it as far as it relates to state aid
defaults
default, but it is a well proven principle as far as charitable taxation goes.
default              
defaultI would also say that the 
defaultlikes of the L
defaultottery would be quite familiar with it. Quite often you will find that a charity will make an application for a development project which, in the end, will be run by 
defaulta different company—
defaulta trading subsidiary or something like that. T
defaulthen t
defaulthey have to have a dialogue with the funders as to how that is going to transfer over into the 
defaultnew thing. These are quite well 
defaultestablished structures. I do not know how it fits within the state aid regulations
default,
default but it may well be a route, as you suggest.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ261 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default There is a process of modernisation of the rules, to some extent, going on at the moment. I understand that the Scottish Government is looking at this. Are you involved in that in any way? Rachael, do you want to express a view?
defaultRachael McCormackdefault: Yes, we are involved
default,
default and during the periods of consultation we have provided detailed information and suggestions. We welcome that review.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ262 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Andrew and Rory, you are nodding as well, as are the Big Lottery Fund. 
defaultFine. 
defaultDo you think the Scottish Government can achieve its target of an additional 
defaulthalf a million 
defaultacres in community ownership by 2020?
defaultAndrew Leaverdefault: Not without substantial change to the mechanisms that they are currently implementing, including state aid
defaults
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ263 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultYes, that was the sort of conclusion we were starting to draw. 
defaultRory, again you are moving your head
default,
default so I think we want to get it on the record.
defaultRory Duttondefault: It is not sheer acres under community ownership that is important; it is the impact in terms of community benefit that is important.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ264 default&#xa0; 
defaultJim McGovern:default What is the target?
defaultRory Duttondefault: I do not honestly know.
defaultAndrew Leaverdefault: The anecdotal understanding is that Alex Salmond stood up and
default said it without consulting his civil servants, but 
defaultI think that is already on your record, because I was reading it previously. That is the common understanding.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ265 default&#xa0; 
defaultJim McGovern:default 
defaultIs it
default Alex Salmond’s target or the Scottish Government’s?
defaultAndrew Leaverdefault: But the civil servants are now required to implement it. Again, through knowledge of friends and colleagues, the civil servants are now looking seriously at that target and the ways in which to approach it, including the body we are dealing with
default,
default which is the Forestry Commission Scotland. The transfer of land for us is through Forestry Commission Scotland. They have to look at that target.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ266 default&#xa0; 
defaultJim McGovern:default When you say how to approach it, do you mean how to achieve it?
defaultAndrew Leaverdefault: How to achieve the target.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ267 default&#xa0; 
defaultJim McGovern:default So it is achievable.
defaultAndrew Leaverdefault: I cannot say whether it is achievable, but I 
defaulthave just read your evidence and I 
defaultwould say what Peter Peacock said. It is a good way forward to make such a statement. Whether it is achievable is another matter.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ268 default&#xa0; 
defaultJim McGovern:default I detect a hint of doubt
default in your answer.
defaultAndrew Leaverdefault: I think most people in 
defaultScotland
default avoid Scottish politics at the moment, so I will stay clear of that just now.
default              defaultChair:default Oh really,
default you surprise me.
defaultRory Duttondefault: W
defaulte did a baseline study in 2012 on community assets. Of the 436,000 acres
default,
default or whatever
default,
default that were in community land at that point, most of that was through 17 large estates at that time. In relation to the 
defaultearlier point about urban land, just 3
default% of the assets
default—not acres but just assets—a
defaultre in the 
default5% 
defaultmost deprived areas. On the merging of the a
defaultgendas, I do not think the Scott
defaultish Government will necessarily always want to concentrate on that sheer physical area of assets
default, rather i
defaultt is on the impact it is having in terms of regeneration, community empowerment and economic activity. I would hope that that target becomes a more added-value target.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ269 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Ah, the target becomes an
default aspiration and then 
defaultit becomes an indicative figure.
defaultRory Duttondefault: No, I meant if you had more community ventures and people employed.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ270 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default It needs to be complemented by other targets, doesn’t it?
defaultRory Duttondefault: Yes.
default&#xa0;
default              defaultChair:default 
defaultBecause w
defaulte are largely looking at the question of land reform
default,
default we have tended to look at it in the context of acreages and so on
default,
default rather than in terms of small urban developments and the like. We will move on to the Scottish Land Fund.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ271 default&#xa0; 
defaultLindsay Roy:default According to the information we have
default,
default the Scottish Land Fund has supported just 22 projects since 2005. To what extent is it fit for purpose? If we take 10 as excellent and one as uns
defaultatisfactory, where does it sit o
defaultn that spectrum?
defaultRachael McCormackdefault: I am not cer
defaulttain in terms of the numbers 
defaultwhether you are aggregating the two periods of the original Scottish Land Fund and the recent one. The current Scottish Land Fund started in July 2012 and has a four-year life
default,
default supported with £9 million of investment from the Scottish Government. There are about 77 applications or referrals from the Big Lottery to HIE that we are dealing with at the moment. There are a number of approvals that have gone through. The acquisition of assets and land by communities is not an overnight occurrence. Communities take it very seriously
default,
default and the due diligence and feasibility work that communities put in up
default 
defaultfront is not inconsiderable. The arrival and the trading of the Land Fund certainly provided a number of communities with the opportunity to start to think about how they might pursue that as an opportunity.
default 
defaultIn terms of the earlier Land Fund, perhaps Neil might have more on that than me.
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: I do. The original Land Fund opened for business in 2001. It had funded 117 acquisitions by 2006. When the original Land Fund closed
default,
default the Big Lottery Fund opened a different funding programme called Growing Community Assets
default, which
default funded most of what the Scottish Land Fund would have funded, but also funded urban assets and asset development. Growing Community Assets, between 2006 and 2010, made 127 awards worth £48 million. I am not quite sure how that 2005 
defaultfigure 
defaulthas been derived.
default              
defaultThe majority of all 
defaultthe original Scottish Land Fund was invested in rural 
defaultScotland
default, which is to say settlements of 10,000
default people or 
defaultfewer.
default Around £35 million-
defaultworth of Growing Community Assets—the first iteration—was invested in rural Scotland. The overall number of projects is nearer to 300.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ272 default&#xa0; 
defaultLindsay Roy:default And tha
defaultt is for the Scottish Land Fund.
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: The current Scottish Land Fund
default,
default which opened in 2012
default,
default has funded 11 live grants and 
defaulthas 
defaulta pipeline of 77 cases.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ273 default&#xa0; 
defaultLindsay Roy:default On that
default scale of one to 10, where does it sit?
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: In terms of effectiveness and response to demand, it has a very high success rate for the types of grant programmes we have. I think it scores quite strongly in terms of effectiveness and meeting demand.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ274 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default But you are turning lots of them down. You are refusing lots of them because of state aid rules.
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: No.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ275 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default If you have an operation,
default patients die and you are looking afterw
defaultards at your success rate, 
defaultit obviously distorts the figures, doesn’t it?
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: Yes, absolutely
default. 
defaultWhat we are doing where projects are constrained by state aid rules is trying to find ways of making those projects happen, as we described earlier. Glendaruel is a good example where using de minimis and negotiating with private investors
default,
default we have been able to do something. 
default              
defaultWhat we are not doing is saying to groups, “We have a state aid issue here and we can
default’
defaultt talk to you.” We are trying to work through those issues and find ways of enabling those projects to happen. That sometimes means different funding packages. Sometimes it means the project does not quite look like they might have wanted it to look. What we are not doing is holding up our hands in horror, holding our noses and walking away when we think there is a state aid issue with it. We are seeking to find ways of making those projects happen. In the end
default,
default we are in the business of trying to fund things. As you pointed out, that is what we are there to do.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ276 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default You ca
defaultn always get money out 
defaultthe door. To be fair, I do not think you all come into work every day 
defaultsaying
default, “Well, whose aspirations can we crush today?” I do accept that. However, there is the issue about whether or not the groups with whom you are dealing are happy about the way in which you are implementing the rules and the rules you are implementing. We are obviously going to be speaking a bit more to some of the organisations. I am just trying to identify what you think their reaction is likely to be. You think they are likely to give you pretty high scor
defaultes for general helpfulness.
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: I do. If I look at the evaluations of programmes done in the past and at the work we have done in talking to people about the service they are getting, what they tell us is that satisfaction levels are pretty high. We
default are a funder. We
default tend to speak to people we have given money to, so we take that attribution into account. When you look at the way grant
default-
defaultmaking operates in Scottish Land and at the kind of support communities receive in working up their project and developing their application, whether that is small simple grants to do a lot of the technical work or expert technical advice or support from advis
defaulters at HIE, it is a pretty high 
defaultquality grant-making offer. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ277 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default We will have to judge some of that. In my constituency
default,
default nobody ever complains about being granted asylum because they have the decision they want. That is the issue for yourselves as well. 
default              
defaultRattling on, d
defaultoes anybody else have any other views about the Scottish Land Fund? Rachael, you were giving visual expression
default.
defaultRachael McCormack: default 
defaultWas I indeed?
defaultChair:default defaultYes, you were indeed,
default and since 
defaultHansard
default does not record that, do you have a view on the merits or otherwise of the Scottish Land Fund?
defaultRachael McCormackdefault: I wanted to give a few more numbers to the Committee. There are 11 Scottish Land Fund approvals that have gone through, only two of which have included an element of state aid. 
defaultThe approach to maximise the no 
defaultaid argument that HIE takes has been able to be delivered in its entirety in nine out of the 11. To my knowledge
default,
default there have been no state aid refusals i
defaultn the way that you describe—
defaultcommunities going away from the Scottish Land Fund per se absolutely not engaged with us any longer. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ278 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default In relation to the target group of 11 that you are measuring
default,
default I am not clear whether or not there were aspirations that were crushed before they got to that stage. People might walk in through your door at the very beginning, but how many of them are just dismissed at that stage? That would be a more realistic assessment of numbers. You might end up with nine out of 
default1,000
default if 
defaultit was a question of people who
default had expressed a desire.
defaultRachael McCormackdefault: The partnership between HIE and the Big Lottery around the Scottish Land Fund is that the Big Lottery undertake an initial appraisal discussion with applicants to determine that they are fit, and then they make a referral on to HIE. We then work very actively with those referred organisations. Those are the 77 that I refer to. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ279 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Could I 
defaultcome back to the question of Gigha and Sout
defaulth Uist?
default Thinking back to the comparison with Andrew’s scheme, both Gigha and South Uist had substantial commercial elements in them, did they not?
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: Gigha is interesting
default,
default because it was bought by the community prior to the land reform legislation. It was done on a clock. It was also done with the asset allotted in a way that they had no choice
default around
default. When the community bought Gigha
default,
default they bought it with a fairly outline plan of what they might do. To a very large extent they were not coming and saying, “We have this very clear commercial vision.” They were able to communicate that they saw potential in the island
default,
default but they clearly had some severe challenges, not least of whi
defaultch was that almost all the housing
default was judged unfit for habitation. They clearly had a whole bunch of d
defaultifficulties
default to deal with and what they have since done has been pretty fantastic. The funding that went into simply transferring the ownership of that asset to the community was, in our view at that time, a reasonable thing to do and did not create a risk that was unacceptable to us.
default              
defaultSubsequently
default,
default over time
default, they have developed
default a range of projects. They have financed those in different ways. The straightforward transfer of ownership of that estate at that time did not present a great difficulty.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ280 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Coming back to Andrew’s scheme, I am aware that it is always a bit difficult building too much on the
default basis of one particular case, but i
defaultt sounds to me from what yo
defaultu are saying that his mistake i
defaults to have a complete package. If he had n
defaultot got the commercial arm—the business plan—
defaultworked out and if it had been much less cohe
defaultrent and less sustainable, 
defaulthe would have had a much greater chance of getting the buying of the location through and then he could work out all the rest of it later on. By then the grant would have been paid and so on.
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: It is 
defaultpartly that, but it is 
defaultalso partly that there is a much clearer set of regulations around the purchase of forestry.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ281 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default This is an issue about forestry in particular. I am just trying to separate these issues. Is it the case that his problem is that he is involved with forestry, and forestry is much more difficult to proceed with? Had it been other things that he was doing
default,
default might it have been much easier to put through? 
defaultEric is enthusiastically nodding at that point.
defaultEric Samueldefault: I think this is where we started this afternoon. There are particular rules around forestry, agriculture and various activities in terms of state aid
default,
default and that is when you run into difficulties. The fact that we have funded a heck of a lot of other projects with no difficulties speaks to that.
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: Forestry is different.
default&#xa0;
default              defaultChair:default We are drawing to a conclusion. Members have had 
defaultto go to other things. Two had m
defaultinisterial meetings
default,
default so they did feel they had to leave. 
defaultColleagues, a
defaultre there any final points that 
defaultyou 
defaultwant to raise? I will then ask 
defaultthe witnesses
default if there is anything you want to get off your chests.
default              defaultJim McGovern:default I would point out that we are outnumbered, Chair.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ282 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I am the person 
defaultwho
default decides whether or not a vote takes place in these circumstances. As I said to you privately before we came in, are there any answers you had prepared to questions that we have not asked? Is there anything you feel that we have not touched on so far that, as part of our inquiry, we ought to be aware of?
defaultAndrew Leaverdefault: You asked earlier about how we could get an extra 
defaulthalf a million
default acres into community ownership. I said that they would need to change approaches. One of the approaches that needs to be looked at—and we have not had a chance to look at it today but it might fall under the remit of your Committee—is the identification of the benefit to the public purse of the sale of the public asset; whether that is a purely financial calculation or whether they should take into account the social and economic benefits. 
default              
defaultWhen we fill in application forms as a community group, whether to get permission to buy or to get the funds to buy, we have to make a point about the economic benefits
default we produce
default, the social benefits 
defaultwe produce 
defaultand the environmental benefits we produce. All three of those are measured equally by the decision makers in our right to buy and 
defaultin 
defaultour funders. But when we go to get a valuation on the land
default,
default because we are buying from the public purse
default,
default they only look at the economic value of that land. They do not look at any of our social or environmental benefits.
default              
defaultWhat really frustrates me—
defaultthis is a personal thing—is I get told that they are protectin
defaultg the taxpayers’ interests, 
defaultyet the community that wants to buy are taxpayers and it would be in our interest to have it transferred. That interpretation of the Treasury rules is something that needs to be looked at. If they could find a different way of interpreting it to include social and environmental benefits, it would bring down asking prices and increase the transfer opportunity of the land.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ283 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default The Big Lottery Fund mentioned something along the same lines. Do you agree with that?
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: What we measure when we choose to fund a community asset purchase are the outcomes that asset will deliver for the community. We look at those on social, economic and environmental terms. For us, it is a social return on investment.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ284 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I think we are quite familiar with this general issue. We have had the same thing with the Crown Estate, for example. General Treasury rules fail to distinguish between price and value. That is an ongoing dispute.
default              
defaultAre there any other issues that you wanted to raise with us? I want to pick up one sub-point that has been pointed out to me. This is for the Big Lottery Fund in particular. You state in your evidence that there was a problem with the way in which the Treasury rules are interpreted via the Scottish 
defaultp
defaultu
defaultblic finance m
defaultanual. Do you have examples of that?
defaultEric Samueldefault: As we said earlier, and as we explain in the evidence, for purely practical reasons, as we have a finite sum of money, we tend to ask applicants who want to take over assets to try and get a reduced value. What you might get in some cases are local authorities saying that they cannot do that. On the other hand we know, because we have experience of it across the last 10 years or so, that they can get round that when they want to do that
default,
default and still comply with the legislation. That is the problem.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ285 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default For the record, you are saying that many of the public bodies, particularly local authorities, would be able to reduce the price if they wished to do so and still be within Treasury guidelines and the Scott
defaultish Government’s finance m
defaultanual.
defaultEric Samueldefault: Our experience is that they do it. It is not for us to inquire how they have done that, but as long as they offer these communities a discount we are quite happy with that. It has happened. There are various ways they can do it. They can still charge full value but give the group a grant for the equivalent amount
default,
default so it is just a total paper exercise. There are ways they can do it.
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: It links to a 
defaultconcern—
defaulta number of communities have said this—that owning the asset is the start of the process for those communities. If you exhaust all of your resources in the purchase of the asset and you do not have capital to then invest in doing things with that asset, that is a difficulty for us. We think we get more return for those communities by investing lottery grant money in developing the asset once you have ownership of it
default,
default than just the bare ownership itself. Where we see public bodies, who have interests in communities doing those things too, ab
defaultle to assist with that cost,
default that feels like a more positive situation for us and for them.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ286 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I 
defaultunderstand that, but arising from what we have said earlier on
default, and
default looking at the Gigha example where it was bought as an asset without the funding for the development element at that stage, the state aid rules in terms of international and local competition are less likely to be applied if it is a less sustainable business plan proven scheme that they ar
defaulte putting forward.
defaultNeil Ritchdefault: Development plans are not always just for commercial activities. They can 
defaultbe for social outcomes as well, so it depends. 
defaultWe are always trying to find ways of doing that in a positive way. Gigha did receive development funding when the purchase went through. They employed some very good development managers
default,
default and that was key to the success of that project. The point was that when that purchase happened, it had to happen quickly and so there was not a detailed plan
default,
default but there was a requirement to develop that detailed plan going forward. 
defaultRory Duttondefault: There is a big difference between local authorities and agencies. There was a statutory instrument from 2010 passed by the Scottish Parliament about the disposal of land by local authorities, which means that local authorities no longer have to go to the Minister. If they can justify transferring an asset, land or building at a nominal sum because of the wider benefits, they can do that. They do not have to ask anybody; it is within their power. Agencies always get bogged down in these Treasury rules. That is where we really want to see the movement
default—in the Treasury rules—
defaultbecause there are a lot of other public agencies, other than local authorities, who have surplus assets.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ287 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Let me clarify this. If the local authorities do not have to seek justi
defaultfication from the Minister, 
defaultdo the other public agencies have to do that, or do they just have to sort it out internally, in which case the Treasury rules are much more likely to be something that are used to hide behind?
defaultRory Duttondefault: The Treasury rules did not apply, as I understand it, to local authorities. They used to have to go to the Minister and now they can do it themselves internally. My understanding is that the agencies are more bound by the Treasury rules. I cannot comment as to how—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ288 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default And there is not a mechanism by which they can appeal to the Minis
defaultter and seek guidance and so on.
defaultEric Samueldefault: There is something in the paper that Andy and his colleagues wrote and that John Elvidge has put together, saying that it is not an insurmo
defaultuntable problem for Government D
defaultepartments.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ289 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default We just wanted to hear some response from you on some of the points. Are there any final
default, final
default points that people want to make?
defaultRory Duttondefault: I want to come back to a point that w
defaultas raised earlier, when
default I was not going to risk looking for a fact in the Scottish Government’s consultation paper on the Community Empowerment Bill. I was asked a question about whether the Scottish Government was indeed minded to make it universal. Would you 
defaultnote 
defaultthat it is on page 18 and in question 17. It follows paragraph 67. It does say that 
default“
defaultthe 
defaultScottish 
defaultGovernment proposes to extend right to buy to communities in all parts of Scotland
default,
default where the Scottish G
defaultovernment is satisfied that it
default is in the public interest.
default”
default So they are asking the qu
defaultestion and they are saying
default that they intend 
defaultdoing
default it; what do you think of it? That answers the question the gentleman asked earlier.
defaultRachael McCormackdefault: 
defaultCould I reiterate a point made by Neil?
default Whilst I appreciate that the Committee is focusing on land reform, the acquisition of land by communities is by no means the end of the journey. Neil referred to it as the start. It is the start perhaps after two or three years of fairly intensive exploration by a com
defaultmunity. Community ownership
default bestow
defaults
default many benefits. Communities fundamentally step forward and take responsibility. They look for new opportunities and plan sustainably. It is innate within their community-owned asset that they are thinking not just about a short-term gain but an inter-generational transfer over time. 
defaultThey respond to community needs because community organisations are charged
default,
default and wish to be charged
default,
default with that remit. Very powerfully, communities have a stake in their own future so local 
defaultpeople are making decisions about local priorities and local needs. They are able to respond with strong development plans. As Neil has said, they include things that they want to do for their community, for their society but also for the local economy. As you study, as you will, the land reform agenda
default,
default I think that is probably the most salient and most powerful agenda for ourselves as HIE.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ290 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultThat was a paean of praise
default for community development
default,
default and we appreciate and understand that. That is why we are in favour of this and 
defaultthat is why we are 
defaulthaving these hearings. What we are trying to investigate is the extent to which organisations like yourselves
default, which 
defaultare the
defaultre to help community groups, 
defaultare doing so,
default and the
default extent 
defaultto which 
defaultyou are being hidebound by rules that could perhaps be changed if a more entrepreneurial attitude was applied either by you or by those giving you guidance.
default              
defaultAre there any final
default, final, final
default points?
default This is your last opportunity. There are two minutes before we are due to close.
defaultRory Duttondefault: The final point is to do with cultural change. We are saying we want a cultural change vis-à-vis the interpretation of state aid
defaults
default. We are also seeking a cultural change across the public sector as regards trusting communities to lead their own development and do that. It is all part of the same scene, whether it is state aid
defaults
default or whatever you are dealing with.
default&#xa0;
default              defaultChair:default On that happy note, let me thank you very much for coming. I appreciate that you have to try and catch a plane. We have finished two minutes early according to the timetable you gave us earlier on. 
default&#xa0;
default
