[[[The British Horse Society - Written evidence]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;It is my pleasure, as Chief Executive of The British Horse Society, to respond to the call for written evidence of the Joint Select Committee on the Draft Deregulation Bill.&#xa0;We are honoured to submit this evidence and contribute to this important step in the process of improving the legal record of public rights of way.&#xa0;We submit this evidence in support of the recommendations made by Defra and the Natural England Stakeholder Working Group on Unrecorded Public Rights of Way, of which The British Horse Society is a participant. We are keen to see Defra and the Natural England Stakeholder Working Groupâ€™s recommendations implemented in full, as they are the consensus view of all interested parties in the rights of way sector, and were designed in the spirit of fairness&#xa0;to be de-regulatory in their overall effect.&#xa0;We believe that the process of setting out the legal framework for recording public rights of way should be conducted in a spirit of mediation and discussion rather than staggering bureaucracy.&#xa0;We would be honoured to be invited to give oral evidence before the Joint Select Committee as part of a delegation representing the different interests found in the Stakeholder Working Group.&#xa0;We would like to join the committee in cutting through the red tape and establish a legal framework for recording public rights of way that is practical, deregulatory and fair to all.&#xa0;Furthermore, we would appreciate the opportunity to explain in person some of the more complex issues found in our submission, specifically why the provisions in Schedule 6 Paragraph 2 of the current Draft Deregulation Bill will not prove deregulatory when applied. &#xa0;I look forward to hearing from you.&#xa0;Lynn PetersenChief Executive&#xa0;18 September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
