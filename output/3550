[normal]Written evidence [bold]from South West Whistleblowers Health Action Group (AMO0005)[bold]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;[bold]My name is Mrs Daphne 
[normal]Havercroft
[normal]. I present this evidence on behalf of the South West Whistleblowers Health Action Group. We are a group of patients and members of the public based in the Bristol and Bath area. Three of us are members of University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Background[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Evidence[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1. [bold]The main points we have raised this year with Monitor are:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.[bold] The underlying issue is the culture in University Hospitals Bristol. Despite the lessons which should have been learned from the Kennedy Inquiry and the Francis Inquiry, the Trust and other NHS organisations in Bristol still prioritise reputation management over openness, transparency and learning. This has been demonstrated most recently in its defensive response to a warning notice served on it by CQC in October 2012 after 
[normal]inspectors found that it had failed to meet three essential standards of quality and safety covering staffing levels, staff training and support, and the overall care and welfare of patients at the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.[bold] When we met Monitor in February we agreed to provide further information and evidence for review. We supplied it in June and drew Monitor’s attention specifically to evidence of very serious irregularities in the conduct of histopathology case reviews which undermine the conclusions of the Royal College of Pathologists and the Inquiry Report. It should be noted that the College has seen this evidence and has not refuted it. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.[bold] We wrote again to Monitor in October 2013 drawing its attention to University Hospitals Bristol’s use of public money to employ legal firm DAC 
[normal]Beachcroft
[normal] to represent it in upholding its position whereby it deems all Freedom of Information requests relating to histopathology and paediatric pathology services “vexatious” and refuses to answer them. We wonder whether the Trust governors are aware of the way in which the Trust is spending public money particularly when it and neighbouring North Bristol NHS Trust have jointly stated that local NHS organisations are facing a £290 million pound shortfall for the next five years. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.[bold] We drew Monitor’s attention 
[normal]to evidence indicating that the Trust may have breached the Freedom of Information Act by blocking release of some information. We have also drawn its attention to our concerns that evidence
[normal] exists to indicate that the 
[normal]way in which the Histopathology Inquiry was commissioned and conducted breached the Data Protection rights of witnesses who voluntarily participated in it. We have asked to meet Monitor to discuss this. Its response is that the Information Commissioner is best placed to investigate these matters in the first instance. Monitor does not seem to appreciate that in order for the Information Commissioner’s Office to investigate alleged breaches of the Data Protection Act 1998, it first requires that we give the Trust the opportunity to respond to the allegations. Our experience is that the Trust’s usual response is to ignore them. We regard this as a matter for Monitor to deal with as the Trust’s regulator because this 
[normal]behaviour
[normal] is a failure of the Trust’s governance which falls within Monitor’s remit. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.[bold] We told Monitor that in Bristol that there are still pockets of bullying and suppression of people (including patients and the public) who try to hold the NHS to account. Yet Monitor and other regulators fail to take it seriously and do anything about it. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.[bold] We informed Monitor that we are concerned that we have seen evidence that indicates that the Trust may be trying to provide a 
[normal]Paediatric
[normal] Pathology Service with insufficient specialist staff. This is a problem which 
[normal]paediatric
[normal] surgeons first raised in 2001, the year the Kennedy Inquiry into child heart deaths was published. Monitor has not acknowledged or responded to this specific and very serious issue. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.[bold] The Histopathology Inquiry Report says that 
[normal]“Overall there is no evidence to lead us to believe that the 
[normal](University Hospitals Bristol)
[normal] department provides anything other than a safe service”
[normal] This is contradicted by the contents of the Report and also by emails we have obtained from the Department of Health under the Freedom of Information Act. On 3
[normal]rd
[normal] December 2010 a member of the Department’s Professional Standards Unit made the following comments about a Briefing Note on the Inquiry written by University Hospitals Bristol and provided to the Department by the Strategic Health Authority’s Communications Director, Andrew 
[normal]Millward
[normal] (now Communications Director of NHS Property Services Limited):
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]“The briefing note raises more questions than it answers not least because it appears to
[normal]be UHB Chief Execs own interpretation of the report. Some of the comments seem to
[normal]perpetuate the rivalry between the two 
[normal]organisations
[normal].”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“The briefing note does mention specific findings about the failings/
[normal]behaviour
[normal] of the
[normal]medical directors and other staff. Do you know whether local disciplinary or remedial
[normal]action was undertaken as a result of this, for any of the individuals concerned? Or has the
[normal]Trust/SHA raised this with the GMC or other regulatory bodies?”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“We would also query the line to take that “there is no serious concern about the
[normal]diagnostic quality of histopathology services”. The culture that appears to have pervaded
[normal]the service at UHB individuals refused to take account of peer reviews etc. This forms part
[normal]of the professional performance of each individual clinician at UHB, and as such did cause
[normal]a problem in the diagnostic quality of the service. Whilst we note that many of the senior
[normal]clinicians involved have since moved on, we did wonder how many original staff were still
[normal]present at both UHB and North Bristol and to what extent this culture may be prevalent
[normal]while senior posts are being filled. Is the SHA aware of whether UHB has involved the
[normal]National Clinical Assessment Service 
[normal](NCAS) 
[normal]at all, in order to assess any individual(s)?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.[bold] The Department’s Ministerial Briefing was issued on 6
[normal]th
[normal] December 2010, two days before the Inquiry Report was released. It was copied to Una O’Brien and Professor Sir Bruce Keogh. It included this statement 
[normal]“If asked to comment on histopathology services at UBH: Department of Health spokesperson said: “The report shows no significantly serious cause for concern about the diagnostic competency of the histopathology services at United Hospitals Bristol Trust.””
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10.[bold] We wonder whether Ms O’Brien and Sir Bruce are aware of how and why the Trust’s line that there was no serious concern about diagnostic quality was upheld in the Department’s Ministerial Briefing, despite the clear reservations about taking that line which were expressed by a member of the Department of Health’s Professional Standards Unit. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11.[bold] On 15
[normal]th
[normal] August 2013 we made this request to Monitor because the Department of Health told us it did not hold answers to the important questions raised by its Professional Standards Unit.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Please provide information held by Monitor relating to the following: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a. Whether or not local disciplinary or remedial action was undertaken as a result of the inquiry for any of the individuals concerned (medical directors and other staff). 
[normal]b. Whether or not the Trust/SHA raised the issues with Monitor. 
[normal]c. Whether or not any individuals implicated in the "problem of the diagnostic quality of the service" were assessed by the National Clinical Assessment Service.’”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12.[bold] Monitor replied on 30
[normal]th
[normal] August 2013 saying that it did not hold the information. We find it strange and very unsettling that a regulator would not hold such important information. We asked CQC the same questions. It too said that it did not hold the information. However it mentioned that it was informed verbally during an inspection that one individual had been referred to the GMC. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13.[bold] Monitor has recently confirmed that it takes our concerns seriously and has followed up some of them with University Hospitals Bristol. In particular Monitor asked the Trust:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14.[bold] Monitor reports that it has received and considered the Trust’s response and scheduled a meeting to discuss them. It advised that it will update us after the meeting, but may be limited in the amount of information it can share with us. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15.[bold] Monitor has missed the point. It is dealing with a Trust Board, including the Chief Executive and Chair, which commissioned a Histopathology Inquiry at public expense. The Inquiry was claimed to be Independent, ignored the most basic requirement to investigate the reasons for clinical and corporate governance failings and based its conclusions on a flawed case review. This was all accepted by the Trust Board. Consequently its opinions are of no reassurance to us because we regard its members as more interested in reputation management than safe care and we do not trust their judgement. Monitor seems unwilling to acknowledge that it is patients and the public who need to be assured that the service is safe. Secrecy does not provide any reassurance. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]16.[bold] As we stated in our evidence for the Committee’s Annual Accountability Hearing with CQC
[normal] [bold]we
[normal] should be able to raise our concerns with the Trust's public and patient governors and have them taken seriously. It is impossible to do so. We have seen evidence confirming that the public and patient governors do not hold meetings with the constituents whose interests they are supposed to represent and have no plans to do so. This undermines the Trust’s obligation to be accountable to the patients and members of the public it serves. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17.[bold] We wish to provide written evidence separately to this Committee and the Public Accounts Committees into the use by the NHS of Inquiries. We will use the Bristol Histopathology Inquiry as a case study. Such inquiries are claimed to be independent, they are paid for by the public and are not governed by statute. We believe that an inquiry by each Committee into the commissioning and conduct of such NHS inquiries would be enlightening to the Committees and the public.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Recommendations [bold]&#xa0;[bold]We thank the Committee for the opportunity to provide written evidence to inform its 2013 Accountability Review with Monitor. We recommend that it refers to our evidence to explore with Monitor how patients and the public can have confidence in a regulator that conducts its regulatory activities in secrecy, fails to intervene when a Foundation Trust and its governors fail to meet their obligations to be open and accountable to patients and the public and does not acknowledge and act 
[normal]on concerns about the safety of children when they are brought to its attention, as in the case of Bristol’s Paediatric Pathology.
