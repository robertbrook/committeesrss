[[[EXECUTIVE SUMMARY]]]Save a Child’s Heart (SACH) welcomes the opportunity to respond to the House of Commons Select Committee inquiry on the UK’s Development Work in the Middle East. SACH is an international, non-governmental, non-political, non-profit organization founded in 1996 in Holon, Israel at the Wolfson Medical Centre (WMC) with the mission of improving the quality of paediatric cardiac care for children from low to lower-middle income countries suffering from rheumatic and congenital heart disease and creating centres of competence in these countries. SACH is fully dedicated to the idea that every child deserves the best medical treatment available, regardless of the child's nationality, religion, race, gender or financial situation. Due to the fact that over 50% of the children, who receive cardiac care from SACH, reside in the West Bank and Gaza, it is of significance for SACH to respond to this inquiry.
