"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence on behalf of Portia, Dr. Elizabeth Pollitzer, Director, 25 August 2013&#xa0;Executive Summary\nBackground of the Organisation\nPortia\n is a not-for-profit organisation\n (\nhttp://www.portiaweeb.org.uk\n)\n based in the UK, originally established in 1997 by a group of \nwomen \nscientists at Imperial College\n \nto advance \ngender equalit\ny in STEM.  M\nost recently\n, Portia led \nthe \ninfluential European \nFP7-funded project\n genSET (\nhttp://www.genderinscience.org\n).  genSET asked science leaders to\n \nexamine\n the research evidence \non gender\n issues in science and produce a\n \nconsensus \nreport with recommendations for action at institutional level. \n This resulted in a report with 13 specific and achievable recommendations. In 2011, genSET \ncreated the Gender Summit platform\n,\n \nhttp://www.gender-summit.com\n to continue the \ndialogue between the \nscientists, policy makers\n and gender scholars, to \njointly consider \nthe \nresearch evidence and agree on the actions\n needed to address gender problems and improve \nquality\n of research. \n&#xa0;\nInformation for the Committee\n&#xa0;\nWhy do numbers of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;1. \nTaking the EU as a whole, \n80% of \nA-Grade (full professor) academic positions are \ntaken by men. This is \na little lower\n th\nan 10 years ago, down from 85%. \n The average \nfemale professor figure for the UK is\n \n20.8%\n (taking all universities together)\n; a\nmong the top 10 universities it ranges between 14% (Imperial College) and 33.8% (University of Bristol).\n2\n. The \nhistorical \nabsence of women in\n research – as participants, \nas \nsubjects, and \nas \nbeneficiaries – has resulted in science \nhaving \nmore\n evidence for men than f\nor w\nomen\n,\n and \nin the ‘male’ \nbeing \naccepted as\n the norm in\n study design, and in \nthe \napplication and communication \nof research. \nThe efficacy of research, therefore, is not the same for women and \nfor \nmen. \nFor example, nearly all that is known about the effects of environmental pollution is\n based on studies involving men, but overwhelmingly, pollutants affect women and m\nen differently. \n \n3. \nWhen researchers \ndo \npay\n attention to \nbiological and social \ndi\nfferences between women and men, \nstunning discoveries\n follow\n.  For example, \nmuscle-derived \nfemale stem cells have \nbetter\n regenerative properties than equivalent male cells\n, and \nthe \nmetabolic profiles of women and men \nare \ndistinctly different\n. \nF\nindings \nsuch as these \nhave huge implications for diagnosis and therapy, and for health economics. \nA brief overview \nof when and why sex and gender matter in science\n can be found in \na 2\n-page “A-Z Guide Why Gender Matters in R&amp;D”\n produced by Portia\n, \nwhich is \navailable at \nhttp://www.portiaweb.org.uk/index.php/publications\n. \nIt\n is not only health where it matters what is female and what is male\n.\n4. P\nromotion to professorial po\nsitions requires\n sound record of research grant applications and performance as Principal Investigator (PI). \n But\n \nfewer women than\n men apply for research g\nrants - \nin numbers that correlate to how many women are pre\nsent at professorial levels\n. \nC\nritically, \nwhen women d\no apply, they are \nminimal\nly but systematically\n less successful than men\n in being awarded a grant\n, even in fields where they are well \nrepresented, such as Life Sciences\n and Social Science, as shown in Figure 1 below.\n \n5. \n W\nomen apply for smaller grants, \nreceiving on\n an average of £44,735 less per grant than men\n.  This means that they have \nless money to engage additional researches \nin the\nir\n project\ns (e.g. \nto provide statistical or data analysis support\n) than the better funded male PIs\n. \n \n6. \nI\nt is important to demonstrate intellectual independence during the early career stage and establish\n \na sufficient \nauthor status by being the primary \nauthor and publishing papers in\n high impact journals.  But even\n at\n this stage\n, men tend to hold higher status pos\nitions and have bigger labs whilst \nwomen have greater teaching loads, as well as the main \nburden of family responsibilities\n, so \nhave fewer hour\ns for research compared to men and \nproduce fewer r\nesearch papers, which \nputs them at a\n clear\n disadvantage\n in\n selection process\nes that\n \nuse men’s productivity as the norm.\n7. \nFigure 1 \nbelow \ncompares\n the success rates for women and men across the three a\nreas \nfunded by E\nuropean \nR\nesearch \nC\nouncil\n (ERC)\n:\n \nPhysical and Engineering Sciences, Life Science, and Social Sciences\n.  A\ncross all three areas men received more grants than women.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n8. \n Furthermore, \nT\nable 1 below compares \nthe \ngender balance \nfound among ERC project teams with\n the gender balance \nfound among the complimentary groups of researchers based \nin universities.  This Table\n show that men\n are routinely favoured in the\n appointments\n to ERC research teams, starting from\n PhD level and continuing at eac\nh next career development step, and this adv\nantage is greater than could be justified by how many women and men are available in the system at each level. So, for example, at PhD level, ERC grants engaged 38% of women and 62% of men, which compares to 49% of female PhDs and 51% of male PhDs across E\nU universities.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n9\n. \nEach \nERC grant\n creates an \nopportunity to engage between 5-\n7 additional researchers to suppo\nrt the PI.  T\nhe 3\n400 \ngrants awarded to-date \nwould create opportunities for involving an additional \n20,000 researchers\n, in total.  Around 20% of ERC \ngrants \nare \nhosted in the UK\n and they represent a very important channel for promotin\ng the advancement of talented j\nunior researchers\n by placing them among the PI’s peers and providing opportunities to gain valuable experience\n as collaborators, co-auth\nors, and members of influential academic\n networks. If women are overlooked when project teams are established, they are left out from research career pathways that can lead them to \nthe \ntop-level positions in STEM.\n10\n. \nAs employers, \nUK \nunivers\nities \nhave been increasingly adopting the\n \nHay System of Job Evaluation.  This\n methodology originated\n in the 1950’s in the USA\n as a way to measure work and \nthe \npayment levels for different types of work\n in manufacturing\n. It is \nn\not we\nll suited to the collegial and team-based\n nature of academic world\n. \nIndividuals are recruited to the specific pathway\n (e.g. teaching,\n teaching plus research, or primarily\n resea\nrch) and can progress along the\n pathway\n but cannot \nmove between pathways\n, e.g. \nfrom teaching to research.\n  This can create \ngender bias \nin recruitment, which cannot be corrected later, \nif men are recruited primarily to the research focused \ncareer \npathway\ns\n and women to the teaching-oriented ones\n, which they may acce\npt not knowing the c\nonsequences\n as a way of managing \nthe pressure of \ncareer-life \nrespons\nibilities during \nearly career stages\n.  \n&#xa0;\nWhen women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? What are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in\n different employment sectors?\n&#xa0;\n11\n. \nThe \nexperience of the \nDaphne Jackson Trust (\nhttp://www.daphnejackson.org\n), whose mission \nis \nto return women trained in STEM\n back to STEM\n after a family related career break\n would be an excellent source of this information.\n \n \nThe Trust was established almost 30 years ago by Prof Daphne Jackson, the first female physics professor in the UK, who observe\nd that it would \nbe \ninconceivable if\n society allowed Marie Curie stack shelves\n in the supermarket just because she had two children, and so it should not be right that talented women scientists are stopped from pursuing their career aspirations because they become mothers. \n The Trust’s experience suggests that when women leave scien\nce they \nwork\n as librarians, \nteachers, \nassistant \neditors, \nproject \nmanagers\n, charity workers\n, in media, accountancy, and in admin-oriented jobs, i.e. mainly in roles where science training has no benefit.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhat should universities and the higher education \nsector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice?\n&#xa0;\n12\n.\n  \n27% of women but only\n \n9% \nof men worry that a career in science will make it impossible for them to have a family. \n \nSupporting women during \nthe critical stage between PhD\n, the post-doc training,\n and early group leader is crucial\n. \n For this, u\nniversities\n must recognise the negative influence of the societal \namb\nivalence in attitudes to \ngender equality.  On the one hand, women are encouraged to p\nursue higher education and on the other they are \ndiscouraged \nfrom \npursuing\n \ncareer aspirations \non the same terms as men.\n \n13\n. \nScience believes itself to be ‘gender neutral’ but this is an illusion that hides a whole range of gender bias effects. \nUniversities \nneed to \nbe pro-active in encouraging \nwomen to apply for research grants, by making sure that women’s teaching loads are not bigger than those of men\n, and that they are mentored appropriately.  When project teams are formed, they should be guid\ned to ensure gender balance.  When \nincluded as \npart of the team, women should not be overlooked\n when there are opportunities for\n collaboration, co-au\nthorship or\n \nco-supervision of students, and \nin the \nengagement in \nacademic \nnetworks (not just women’s \nnetworks)\n.\n14. U\nniversities must recognise the pernicious natur\ne of gender stereotypes and of the\n \ngender bias \neffects \nin recruitment and promotion\n.  \nA \nstudy \nreported in 2012, \nled by Yale university\n,\n in which 127 science faculty from research-intensive univ\nersities were asked to rate the application materials of a student – who was randomly assigned either a male or female name – fo\nr a laboratory manager position, showed that b\noth male and female professors rated the male applicant as significantly more comp\netent and preferable to hire than the (identical) female applicant. They also offered the male applicant a higher starting salary and additional career mentoring support\n.  \nS\ncientists may be rigorously trained to be objective, but just like the society at large, \nhold \ngender beliefs that tend to valorise men\n’s progress\n. \n15\n. \nIn 2010, a panel of science leaders from across Europe met to evaluate available research evidence on ge\nnder issues in science\n. \nThey agreed on 13 specific recommendations, which they felt could be implemented and would produce important benefits for individuals, their institutions, and t\no science. Their report is \navailable at \nhttp://www.genderinscience.org\n .\n \nThe recommendations call for integrated\n \nactions\n to improve: 1) science knowledge making, 2) \ninstitutional practices\n and processes, 3) \ncreation \nof human capital, and 4) \ncompliance with regulation.\n16\n. \nIn \nNorway, despite the acceptance of the quota mechanism for women, not one university has as yet achieved even 30% target of women professors.  Universities must examine their processes and practices for sources of gender bias and weed them out. T\nhe\n \nUniversi\nty \nof Tromso \nimplemented a trial evaluation process designed to simulate the promotion process, thereby ensuring that women candidates can be confident that they are ready for promotion before applying. The Tromso board has also set the conditions that all\n advertised positions will have search committees specifically charged with finding women applicants, requiring that the applicant pool for any particular positi\non has no fewer than 40% women, and has made available \nfunds \nfor department \nchairs and deans \nto\n \nidentify specific support measures \nsuch as \nshort-term buy-outs from teaching duties, statistical support, research assistance, data processing support. \n17\n. \nIn the UK, \nthe National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)\n has made future \nresearch \nfunding \ncond\nitional on the academic partner achieving at least the Silver Award of the Athena SWA\nN Charter for Women in Science\n. The SWAN scheme was introduced in the UK ten years ago to promote gender equality in recruitment\n, advancement and promotion of female acade\nmics. \nFollowing the NIHR decision\n in 2011\n, a\npplications to the SWAN Charter Award soared, trebling in number during 2012-2013.\n18\n.  \nUniversities can also examine their \napproaches to managing their academic \nhuman resources \nto ensure that during \nrecruit\nment women are not channeled into \ncareer pathways that limit opportunities\n to establish intellec\ntual independence and assemble the\n solid record of research experience\n that is needed for advancement in STEM\n. \n1\n9\n.  \nWhilst science institutions may differ grea\ntly in their overall strategies,\n \nand in \ntheir wish to \nmaintain independence and ability to co\nmpete,\n \nthey are\n responsible for \ngender equality in \nthe distribution of \nresearch resources and \nof \nthe associated c\nareer \ndevelopment \nopportunities\n.\n&#xa0;\nWhat role should\n the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers?\n&#xa0;\n20\n. \n The legal framework places \nresponsibility for\n equality and diversity\n on universities as employers but this is a too narrow scope for addressing gender inequalities in science because it overlooks the \nsocial importance\n \nof science institutions and scientists, for example as\n \npolicy advisers to the Government or guardians of \nt\nhe \nethical and social responsibility concerns in \nthe \ns\ncienc\ne governance. The Government could\n insist that the soc\nial importance of science is recognised\n by involving both women and men, equally, in science governance and in major policy consultative roles. \n21\n. The \nNorwegian experience \nshows that\n \nuniversities can easily shrug-off policies promoting positive gender-balancing actions by claiming ‘excellence\n’ to be thei\nr main goal.  The Government could\n insist that the distribution of public research resources (to which wom\nen contribute as taxpayers) should\n not disadvantage women as researchers, as subjects of research and as beneficiaries of \nthe \nsocietal inv\nestment in science and technology.\n22. The Government can also fine-tune the childcare support policies by recognising the special demands placed on women scientists (and men) during early career stage who have childcare responsibilities, such as having to\n attend conferences or work late in the lab to complete experiments.  Their childcare \nissues may be more complex and \ncosts can be higher than those of the parents in other sectors\n,\n \nwith few\n opportunities to increase income without taking time away from res\nearch.\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n She Figures 2012, European Commission, Brussels 2012\n ERC: European Research Council.  It awards grants to individuals, not institutions | DGG: German Research Foundation.
