The case for district heating should therefore be assessed on a site-by-site basis where possible, in the context of other strategic drivers for community energy approaches (e.g. seeding a network of low carbon heat supply that could be used to decarbonise neighbouring existing buildings).\n This study focuses on the most cost-effective energy strategies based on capital costs only. On-going costs (and the impact of support schemes such as the feed-in tariff or renewable heat incentive) have not been considered.\n"
