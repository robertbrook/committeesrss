defaultQ185 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultGood morning and thank you very much. It is very nice to meet you again. I am not going to put great introductions to you of why we are here because I am sure you realise 
defaultthat 
defaultwe are doing an inquiry in youth unemployment
default,
default following the 
defaultD
defaultirective from the European Commission. We are taking evidence from all sorts of people, including the youth who are unemployed
default. We have taken evidence in different 
defaultareas of the 
defaultUK
default, 
defaultincluding 
defaultBirmingham
default and 
defaultLiverpool
default. We have taken evidence from everybody through the 
defaultUK
default, but we decided 
defaultthat the issue was so important that 
defaultwe needed to come to 
defaultBrussels
default,
default and it has been a very worthwhile situation yesterday and today.
defaultIt is kind of you to make this time available to us. We will have transcripts and we will send them to you for correction. I think 
defaultthat 
defaultyou have met them, but on my extreme left is Lord Freeman
default, who has spent
default 40 years in politics, half in the House of Commons and now in the House of Lords, Conservative; Lord Wilson
default,
default ex-
defaultCivil Service, Foreign Office, Governor of Hong Kong and academia, a 
defaultC
defaultross
default-B
defaultencher; Lord Brooke, ex-trade union
default official
default, now 16 years in the House of Lords, Labour; and I am 22 years in the House of Lords and I am a Conservative.
default I came up on a non-political route.
defaultI am going to ask you the first question. How much of a threat to Europe 2020 is the very high youth unemployment throughout the EU?
defaultCommissioner Andor: defaultFirst, let me thank you for coming. I take this as recognition of the interest 
defaultin 
defaultour common work and the importance 
defaultof 
defaultthe role of the European Commission in combating unemployment, and especially youth unemployment in the European Union, in these difficult times. Indeed, we started this mandate of outlining the Europe 2020 strategy with ambitious goals, especially increasing the employment rate in the EU. Of course, it is a very interesting question: how the dynamics of 
defaultthe 
defaultemployment rate and the unemployment rate affect each other. Very often the level of unemployment is seen as a cyclical issue, while the long periods of unemployment also affect employability. They cause damage to the employment rate, too.
defaultThe answer to your question is that such high levels and long periods of youth unemployment significantly threaten our objective of reaching a 75% employment rate in the European Union. This simply means that the entry into the labour market of a generation that is probably better trained than previous generations is an economic problem and a serious social problem and, in some countries, it is a political problem, too.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultDo you think 
defaultthat 
defaultthere is a connection between youth unemployment and industrial policy, where you have 
defaulta 
defaulttandem of growth and jobs?
defaultCommissioner Andor:default Yes. I will tell you why I believe 
defaultthat 
defaultthere is a connection between employment policy focusing on youth unemployment and industrial policy on the other side. Who are the best performers in the European Union from the point of view of youth unemployment? Which are the countries where the youth unemployment rate is lowest? If you look at the rates
default, the countries are 
defaultAustria
default, 
defaultGermany
default and the 
defaultNetherlands
default. In these countries we have strong, competitive and diversified industrial base, which is also geographically spread in a balanced way. That is closely linked with the concept of the Mittelstand in 
defaultGermany
default,
default and I think it is very important to note that some time ago authors like Will Hutton and, more recently, the head of the CBI
default,
default Mr Cridland
default,
default spoke about the importance of the Mittelstand and the need to shift towards that model.
defaultThe 
defaultUK
default went through a period of severe deindustrialisation of the northern regions in 
defaultthe 
default1980s. This period contributed to an increase in competitiveness, but the concentration in the south, of course, creates questions in terms of improving the job opportunities for young people. That also triggered the significant migration from north to south. 
defaultIn the case of the 
defaultbetter performers that I mentioned, contrary to 
defaultthe 
defaultUK
default figure of 21% national youth unemployment, those countries 
defaulthad a 
defaultyouth unemployment rate 
defaultof less than 10%, even 
defaultin the
default crisis
default years.
defaultT
defaulthis shows that access to apprenticeships and job opportunities in all regions of a country is a very important factor because this concept of Mittelstand
default—
defaultthe way 
defaultthat 
defaultGerman industry is organised in predominantly small and medium-sized companies
default—
defaultalso developed certain structures of vocational training, the so-called dual training model: the parallel process of theoretical and practical learning and work experience for young people. Since this has proven to 
defaultbe 
defaulta very good model in recent years, the European Commission also advocated a transfer of this model to other countries.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultCan I just ask for clarification, Mr Commissioner?
defaultCommissioner Andordefault: Yes.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultDi
defaultd 
defaultAustria
default and the 
defaultNetherlands
default 
defaulthave 
defaultthe same sort of apprenticeship scheme, 
defaultwith 
defaultthe emphasis on vocation and education, going back? 
defaultGermany
default has it in its DNA, in effect.
defaultCommissioner Andordefault: Yes.
defaultThe Chairman:default Post-war, did the other two countries develop the same sort of thing? 
defaultCommissioner Andor:default I would say yes. Largely 
defaultthe answer 
defaultis yes, plus we can add 
defaultDenmark
default as another country. The statistics are marginally worse, but the fundamental model is very similar
default,
default and this model also includes something very important that we think is relevant here, which is the strong social dialogue on all levels: company, industry, cross-sector and national level. The co-operation between employers and employees to shape industrial policy and the capacity to invest in skills plays an important role because these organisations play a role in the governance of training, which is relevant here.
defaultQ186 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default 
defaultIn a sense, you have answered my question, which was: what role should different stakeholders play in tackling youth unemployment
default,
default for example, national Governments and businesses or trade unions
default? 
defaultYou made reference to the importance, as you see if, of the social dialogue, which I personally support, but there is a different view held in some countries about the extent to which social dialogue is practised
default. I
defaultn certain European countries there has been a historical opposition
default, 
defaultor at least a change of position has been established over a number of years
default—
defaultand notably in the 
defaultUK
default there ha
defaults been opposition.
default To what extent is the Commission’s role to advocate a particular view when in fact there may be contrary ones held on how the industrial base should be organised?
defaultCommissioner Andor:default The Commission has a responsibility, by respecting the treaty, to promote dialogue, while at the same time respecting the diversity of industrial relation
defaults
default systems in the EU. We cannot force a specific format of industrial relations or social dialogue on countries. Of course, it is very important to ensure that there is an autonomous organisation of either trade unions and employers’ organisations, but we have a responsibility to maintain and cultivate social dialogue for the sake of economic performance and social co-operation, too. The Commission also has capacity to provide financial support from 
defaultthe 
defaultEuropean 
defaultS
defaultocial 
defaultF
defaultund
default,
default but also some other direct resources
default,
default 
defaultto develop 
defaultthe capacities of social partners on various levels. One of your colleagues in the House of Lords, Lord Monks, knows this very well because he has been working here 
defaultfor 
defaulta long period as a general secretary of the ETUC, which is not only involved 
defaultin this area 
defaultbut 
defaultis 
defaultalso strongly supported by the European Commission.
defaultQ187 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Freeman:default 
defaultCommissioner, perhaps I could follow on directly from the question put by Lord Brooke. Because there is no specific universal formal mechanism to apply to all countries, you have to be flexible and understand the social dimensions that apply in any particular country. How can you measure the effectiveness of the EU 
defaultS
defaultocial 
defaultF
defaultund and other sources of finance if you have 
defaultsuch a 
defaultsophisticated approach 
defaultto 
defaultdealing with different countries, all of whom have different industrial and social compositions? How do you make sure the EU’s contribution is most effective and how do you measure success?
defaultCommissioner Andor:default 
defaultAs regards 
defaultthe financial resources of the European Union, the European 
defaultS
defaultocial 
defaultF
defaultund and some others, like the regional fund, are implemented in what we call shared management. Shared management is a system by which it is guaranteed that the programming, implementation and also the first level of control is pursued by the member state itself. I think it has been a very clear tendency that, as closer economic governance has been developing in an evolutionary way in the European Union, there is increasingly close co-operation between the Commission and member states in the programming phase. For example, in the current period, which is a programming period, we have to ensure that the Europe 2020 strategy
default,
default on which the member states agreed in 2010
default,
default is supported by available instruments of the EU, including the financial instruments that are used in shared management.
defaultThe managing authorities of the individual member states are crucial in this context and, indeed, another important shift that we would like to see in the current period is a move towards a more results-based evaluation. What does this mean? Just yesterday I was in European Parliament discussing with the members of the European Parliament the year 2012 on the basis of regulat
defaultion
default, primarily. It is the approach of the Court of Auditors
default,
default and that is why this is always the basis for the evaluation of the EU fund. Nevertheless, the Court of Auditors is also increasingly interested in the results. We are keen to speak more about the actual results. However, there are, very clearly, difficulties.
defaultWhy is that? Through the 
defaultEuropean S
defaultocial 
defaultF
defaultund we can support what is called the supply side of the employment policy
default—
defaultthe development 
defaultand activation 
defaultof skills
default—
defaultwhile we know that the concrete outcomes in 
defaultthe 
defaultlabour market are also affected by the demand side
default,
default where we have some connections but, fundamentally, where the member states themselves have greater room for manoeuvre and greater capacity to influence development. We have been working with the member states. Under 
defaultthe 
defaultLithuanian presidency, there was a very successful conference that I attended in 
defaultVilnius
default last July about a more results-based evaluation of the 
defaultEuropean S
defaultocial 
defaultF
defaultund. We want to integrate this in the current period. We will be interested in all feedback because, indeed, this is a new area where we have to develop a common methodology and a common language together.
defaultLord Freeman:default 
defaultIn measuring achievements, presumably there will be dialogue not only with the Commission but individual member states and trade unions and companies who are obviously on the demand side. In terms of evaluation, is that going to be an annual process at the end of a number of years
default,
default or is it ongoing?
defaultCommissioner Andor:default We can take stock annually and, for example, say that in a particular year 12 million European citizens were assisted by the European 
defaultS
defaultocial 
defaultF
defaultund
default,
default and we can also say, on basis of a concrete sample in a given country or in the EU as a whole, what percentage of the people assisted by 
defaultthe S
defaultocial 
defaultF
defaultund managed to enter a new job within a three-month period. These statistics can be produced. However, we would probably need to see more. The annual evaluation also has certain 
defaultlimitations
default. Because of the business cycle, it not necessarily a fair picture
default;
default 
defaulti
defaultt must be supplemented by longer-term analysis.
defaultQ188 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultI understand absolutely 
defaultabout 
defaultanalysing the outcomes
default,
default but, as a matter of practicality, what
default sort of burden is yet another R
defaultegulation going to put on businesses
default,
default or indeed business as a whole
default,
default and do you think that might have 
defaultthe 
defaulteffect of saying, “Well, we cannot employ anyone else because we have to spend so much time on 
defaultR
defaultegulation”? The reason I am asking that question is 
defaultthat 
defaultthere is a constant moan in the 
defaultUK
default about regulation
default—
defaultand it is not against the EU. It is against the 
defaultUK
default regulatory authorities, also. “If it moves, regulate it”, seems to be the attitude. I am just wondering how you can sell this and 
defaultwhether it 
defaultwould be absolutely imperative that organisations should have to fill in masses 
defaultof 
defaultforms and take them as an actual rule or an order from the EU? I can see 
defaultthat 
defaultthis needs to be treated very gently, particularly in the current circumstances.
defaultCommissioner Andor:default There are two sides to this. On the one hand
default there is
default the use of the financial instrument that we have been mainly discussing here. We were keen to introduce simplifications in the use of the financial instrument, especially concerning the accounting. Of course, lump
default-
defaultsum accounting instead of using the actual costs is supposedly proven by receipts. I think this is a significant simplification and the concrete exercise, which we completed yesterday at the hearing in 
defaultthe 
defaultEuropean Parliament
default,
default also brought up this aspect. There was a very clear
default,
default positive impact of such simplifications on the life of beneficiaries and also on the overall picture in terms of the regularity of 
defaultuse of 
defaultEU funds by member states.
defaultAs 
defaultregards 
defaultthe impact on SMEs, we also had to see the legislative work of the Commission, not only the use of financial resources. This Commission adopted a philosophy 
defaultof 
defaultsmart regulation
default:
default very strong impact assessments before any legislati
defaulton,
default plus, at the same time, an exercise to pursue simplification if necessary: mergers of previous 
defaultD
defaultirectives
default.
default I think this has also resulted in 
defaultthe 
defaultstreamlining of EU legislation in a variety of areas.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultThank you for that. I just hope there is also going to be a post-impact assessment because we are getting keener on that in the 
defaultUK
default.
defaultQ189 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default 
defaultCommissioner, what I wanted to ask you is also connected with results. We gather that the Commission is seeking to define the standards for apprenticeships and for training. There are two things arising from that, please. One is defining apprenticeships. The more we hear about apprenticeships in different countries around European the more it seems that “apprenticeship” means different things in different places. The other bit is exactly the same: diversity. If one is trying to establish standards with a whole number of countries that have very different systems, how do you set about doing it? How effective can one be by defining standards in that way?
defaultCommissioner Andor:default The most important contribution we have made in this area 
defaultis 
defaulta quality framework on traineeships, which the Commission adopted on 4 December, if I am not mistaken. This came under the same youth 
defaultemployment 
defaultpackage that also included the Youth Guarantee a year before. This is a quality framework. This is
default not aiming at a D
defaultirective. Nevertheless, it is a way to present, in a systematic way, what we consider to be good practice, quality traineeships; for example, an ex-ante definition 
defaultof 
defaultwhether a traineeship is paid or not. This is a very important thing from the point of view of transparency
default,
default and a number of other parameters have been discussed in this document. This will be discuss
defaulted
default in the Council. There is a working group that has seen this document and I believe in March the 
defaultEPSCO 
defaultCouncil will have an opportunity to discuss and hopefully welcome this
default,
default and this discussion will have to expand to questions of implementation and how 
defaultto 
defaultmake an impact on the ground.
defaultQ190 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default Could you give us an example of what sort of measures you use to define whether a traineeship meets the requirement or falls below the requirement?
defaultCommissioner Andor:default That is partly the autonomous analytical work of the DG employment
default,
default but 
defaultit 
defaultall also goes through what we call the inter-service consultation. All other portfolios—industry and enterprise, for example, 
defaultor 
defaultinternal markets and education—have a capacity to contribute to this. We also wanted to discuss it with the social partners and this is an important point. We invited the social partners to negotiate ex-ante about this. They opted for a more general discussion on youth employment, so this became a more autonomous proposal of the Commission
default,
default but 
defaultone that was 
defaultbased on 
defaulta 
defaultcross-portfolio analysis of this area.
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default 
defaultJust on apprenticeships, Commissioner, we 
defaulthave 
defaultreceive
defaultd
default what seem to be different definitions of what an apprenticeship is
default,
default and I just wondered how the Commission looks at this, 
defaultand 
defaultwhether there is a defined 
defaultcategory
default of
default,
default “apprenticeship means this and it does not mean that”.
defaultCommissioner Andor:default The European Alliance for Apprenticeships, which was launched in July, is a broad platform. It allows for diversity, but it is true that the focus of activities is the German model. Companies open up positions in much larger numbers for training young people than they would need to employ at a later stage
default—
defaultand this, of course, has been the tradition of German industry for quite a long time. 
defaultIt 
defaultis partly work, but also work-based training under certain criteria. Even if someone at the end does not get employed by the company where the training 
defaulthas
default tak
defaulten
default place, he or she 
defaultwill 
defaultstart the search for a job with much better conditions than would be the case other
defaultwise
default.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultThey are one step up the ladder.
default 
defaultWhat is your view of the opinion of some member states that EU intervention in this area is too prescriptive
default and 
defaultdoes not take fully into account the member states’ different mores and practices
default? 
defaultI think that could be a problem.
defaultSecondly
default,
default 
defaultand 
defaulttangentially to 
defaultthat
default, you talk about apprenticeships. We have had quite a lot of evidence on apprenticeships
default,
default ranging from McDonald
default’
defaults having apprenticeships this year of 10,000 people and Barclays of 400, from memory. The McDonald
default’
defaults apprenticeships, people say, “What is that and what is it going to do?” It only lasts a year, whereas the Barclays one would be a lot longer. However, the retention rate of the people who are apprentices within the McDonald
default’
defaults organisation and then their progression
default 
defaultseems to be very high. We are confused, as we have said already, between the definition of apprenticeships and what they should be. 
defaultAlthough
default they are low skilled and doing what you might say is fairly menial work, they do begin to get skills in terms of customer service delivery, discipline at work and delivering everything on time 
defaultand in 
defaultthe right place. It is a problem. One size just does not fit all.
defaultCommissioner Andor:default Definitely one size does not fit all in the EU, in most cases. Let me stress two points. One of them is that
default,
default for quite some time, at least since the start of 
defaultthe 
defaultEuropean employment strategy and the open method of co-ordination, the idea of finding and sharing best practice has been a guiding principle. If I apply this here, for example, 
defaultwith 
defaulta German or Danish model of dual training, or an Austrian or Finnish model of the Youth Guarantee, if consultation and analysis concludes that these are best practices, I think 
defaultit 
defaultis very much 
defaultin 
defaultthe nature of the process
default,
default and extremely rational and legitimate
default,
default to work 
defaultto 
defaultshar
defaulte
default it with other countries.
defaultThis exercise, as you have seen, stops before proposing 
defaultD
defaultirectives. That would be my response to the question about prescriptiveness. We speak about a quality framework on traineeships, 
defaultor 
defaulta quality framework on restructuring
default,
default for example, while we have also seen demand from some in the European Parliament and other stakeholders for 
defaultD
defaultirectives 
defaulti
defaultn this area, but I think that a 
defaultD
defaultirective on these issues would be one step too far. I think the capacity to discuss these issues among the member states and stakeholders, on the basis of a quality framework, is the right one because it identifies best practice but also allows for application with flexibility within the member states.
defaultQ191 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default 
defaultPerhaps 
defaultwe can come back to the future and the money that is available to apply to the problem of unemployment and long-term relief
default. W
defaulthat generally are expectations of the move in the emphasis on the way that the European Social Fund should be pushed more towards helping 
defaultthe 
defaultyoung unemployed during the forthcoming period? How do you see the states responding? Could you say something about their emerging proposals, please?
defaultTalking of sharing best practice, my concern is that there often is not openness for the public at large to see just what is happening in 
defaultEurope
default—
defaultwhat the states are suggesting and what is being considered
default—
defaultbefore you come to your analysis and reach your conclusions. I wonder sometimes whether there should not be more use made of the internet in presenting to the public at large, en route, proposals that are being made rather than a 
defaultfait accompli
default being presented after decisions have been taken.
defaultFinally, could you comment on the Youth Employment Initiative funds that will be coming to member states after their plans have been examined? Is that money conditional on them signing up to the full Youth Guarantee conditions, such as the full month part of it?
defaultCommissioner Andordefault: Let me start from the beginning. In terms of the resources—what we have available for the new financial period and whether it is enough—I am sure you know that the overall EU budget for the new seven-year period has become smaller than that originally proposed by the European Commission. In this discussion, the 
defaultUK
default was one of the countries that insisted on cutting the proposed budget. Unfortunately, this also affected the European Social Fund. The ESF minimum share within 
defaultthe 
defaultcohesion policy became somewhat less than that originally proposed by the Commission
default—
defaultbut, more importantly, in this case the key question is not so much the overall share in cohesion policy but the absolute sums, which will be smaller than in the previous period.
defaultIt is true that now we have a separate financial instrument, which is the Youth Employment Initiative, which will be front
default-
defaultloaded for the first two years. I think it is absolutely justified to front
default-
defaultload because now we have either a recession in some countries still or we feel the impact of the long recession. This front
default-
defaultloading for 2014 and 2015 is just a smart idea. The Youth Employment Initiative has to work in combination with the 
defaultEU S
defaultocial 
defaultF
defaultund. It was defined nearly a year ago that half of it should come from the ESF and half would be fresh money on top, but even if you add it on the top, the overall figure becomes less than the ESF total in the 2007
default to 20
default13 period. We have to make more out of the same 
defaultnumber of 
defaulteuros
default,
default or less.
defaultThat is why we have been, from the very start, advocating a thematic concentration of the structural and investment fund resources to avoid a fragmentation of this EU resource, to concentrate on some key deliverables, which are also national priorities within the member states. I think what we have seen in the last year is the quick adoption of the Youth Guarantee, the establishment of the Youth Employment Initiative and then two high-level summits, one in Berlin and one in Paris, specifically on youth employment, with the participation of heads of state and 
defaultG
defaultovernment
defaults
default from almost all EU member states.
defaultThe Chairman:default I see. Are you telling us we did not attend? Is that the message?
defaultCommissioner Andordefault: Not the head of the Government. In 
defaultParis
default we had, I think, 24 heads of state and there were a few absent, and also in 
defaultBerlin
default. The 
defaultUK
default was represented by Mr Iain Duncan Smith in both cases, which is very important, of course, given the fact that Mr Duncan Smith does not attend the Council meetings, but he attended this high-level conference of heads of state and 
defaultheads of 
defaultG
defaultovernment, plus the Employment Ministers and the leaders of the public employment services. This is a unique forum to have a focused and efficient discussion on the implementation of the Youth Guarantee and other initiatives, and it very often extends to discussing the EU funds role in all this.
defaultThis series of events will continue, because the forthcoming Italian presidency has already announced that 
defaultit 
defaultwill start in July with a similar event in 
defaultRome
default—
defaulthence the opportunity to step in for those who have been absent so far.
defaultThe Chairman:default I think outside this meeting, I would like to have just a quick word with you.
defaultCommissioner Andordefault: I think this series of events gives evidence that this is a priority for member states. We also witness in the procedure that it makes an impact on the work of government offices if there is high
default-
defaultlevel political attention and regular checking 
defaultof 
defaultprogress
default—it makes an impact on 
defaultwhether the preparations continue in the right way or not.
defaultAs much as possible, we also try to involve the young people themselves, the youth organisations. The European Youth Forum is a very important partner for us to consult, but also on certain occasions the national ones. For example, I have had two meetings with the Spanish Youth Council. Historically, as you know well, 
defaultSpain
default has been the country with the highest level of youth unemployment. Discussing these issues with the Spanish Youth Council was very important for me.
defaultQ192 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default On transparency and also the issue about the conditionality attached to that, 
defaultis it 
defaultvital today to try to be more transparent in opening up the plans that come up from the states, using the internet more
default?
defaultCommissioner Andordefault: Yes. I would say 
defaultit 
defaultis a work in progress to enhance the visibility of all these actions and ensure that the information is spread, because it has to make an impact on the aspirations of young people. They have to be informed that there is a new commitment and they need to know what they are supposed to do in order to benefit in practice from it. 
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default It depends on the money for
default—
defaultCommissioner Andordefault: Exactly, the answer is yes. The point is that for the 
defaultUK
default and many other countries this is also part of the country-specific recommendations, which is the concluding document of the European semester. That was included for the 
defaultUK
default last year and it is very important that the 
defaultUK
default also submits the implementation plan. Just a few countries failed to do so by the deadline, which was 31 December. The 
defaultUK
default is one of the few. I think the other two—
defaultSlovenia
default and 
defaultSlovakia
default—have already caught up.
defaultThe Chairman:default So we are the only ones? There are reasons and they are not sinister. They are very practical reasons, but we are aware of that and we shall take that message back.
defaultCommissioner Andordefault: But it is also important to produce the operational programme for the Youth Employment Initiative, with the agreed parameters if possible.
defaultThe Chairman:default Thank you. We will take that message back.
defaultQ193 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Freeman:default How important is the free movement of young people within the various parts of the European Union? What is the role of the European Union, the Commission in particular, in explaining the benefits
default—
defaultto the extent there are
default benefits—
defaultof such migration?
defaultCommissioner Andordefault: The free movement of workers is a fundamental principle of the single market of the European Union. This is a right that European citizens cherish and we have a responsibility to ensure that this right is not violated anywhere, 
defaultthat 
defaultthere is full respect 
defaultfor 
defaultthe treaties and 
defaultthat 
defaultit also applies after transitional periods for new member states of the European Union. Whether people want to take advantage of this right of course varies in terms of age, nationality and cultural tradition. From surveys we find that more than half 
defaultof all 
defaultyoung people are interested in job opportunities in other countries if they do not find one in close proximity, but some of them, of course, even in those cases for professional reasons, for enriching their skills, knowledge and experience, find this important. I think with increasing numbers of students studying abroad we will also see more professional mobility at a later stage simply because of the easier access and more interest in learning in other countries.
defaultThe Chairman:default I think it does need to be highlighted that there are huge opportunities for people to get increased skills
default, including
default language skills
default,
default and if necessary come back home. It used to happen but it seems to have levelled down a bit now.
defaultQ194 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default Let me be very brief, because I think Lord Brooke really asked th
defaultis
default question, but can I be specific on passing on best practice? To what extent can the Commission play a useful role in that? Take for instance the Youth Employment Initiative. Everybody has put in their bids, except one country that is still missing but doubtless will come very soon. That must be a good sort of treasure trove of examples of how different countries are tackling this. It is very useful for other countries to know. We have also heard that there may be difficulties in publicising this information because of what the member states say, and I just wanted to explore that. How can the Commission help by passing on best practice?
defaultCommissioner Andordefault: There are not only political meetings but also technical meetings. For example, last October, just outside Brussels, there was a very important technical meeting by which the Commission was helping the representatives of the member states, in that preparatory phase, to understand the common objectives and what

defaults written in the documents that had been adopted by the Ministers beforehand. This kind of direct support was announced early on. We announced it in June in the EPSCO Council and the member states were invited into this kind of close collaboration with the Commission in case there are questions or a need

defaultThe Commission is not the only actor in this area. We also work together with the ILO, the International Labour Organisation. They also play an active role in this in specific countries like 
defaultPortugal
default, for example. They were very supportive from the start of the concept of the Youth Guarantee, of course respecting national specificities but sharing the key objectives to limit the length of unemployment and ensure that school-to-work transition works much better in

default than it has in the past.
defaultThe Chairman:default Thank you very much indeed, Commissioner, for your time. I know exactly how busy you are, or I think I do. It has been very useful indeed. You mentioned about the youth and so on, and we have already had witnesses from Liverpool and 
defaultBirmingham
default, but our next evidence session is dealing with youth as well here in 
defaultBrussels
default, so it will be interesting to hear from somebody from the European Youth Forum. We will send you the transcript. We expect our report to be published mid-April, just before Easter, and of course we will send you a copy. But your evidence has been really great and thank you for making yourself available.
defaultCommissioner Andordefault: Thank you very much for coming and I am happy that you found it helpful.
defaultThe Chairman:default It has been very helpful indeed. Thank you.
