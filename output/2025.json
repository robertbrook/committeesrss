"              \n              \n \nCRB 55&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by UK Competitive Telecommunications Association&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\nUKCTA is a trade association promoting the interests of competitive fixed-line telecommunications companies competing against BT, as well as each other, in the residential and business markets. Its role is to develop and promote the interests of its member\ns to Ofcom and the Government. Details of membership of UKCTA can be found at \nwww.ukcta.com\n. UKCTA welcomes the opportunity to respond to this \ncall for evidence since \nthe\n Bill contains a number of provisions with very s\nerious implications for our members. \nLast year UKCTA submitted a response to the BIS consultation document on the implementation of the Consumer Rights Directive.  In this response we have confined our comments to three areas of greatest concern to our me\nmbers\n&#xa0;Quality as a matter of custom – \ns.36 (\n10)\nThe first concern which UKCTA has relates to \nsection 36(10) which provides that “A contract to provide digital content may be treated as making provision about the quality of the digital content as a matter of custom.”\nUKCTA does not believe that it is appropriate to infer that any provision is made \nbased on custom. One of the key \ncharacteristics\n of the market for digital content is that it is continuously evolving and that the pace of change is rapid. The reference to custom might be appropriate in a more static market but it is not appropriate in re\nlation to the provision of digital content. UKCTA would therefore suggest that sub section 10 \nought to be\n deleted.\n&#xa0;Fitness for a particular purpose – Sections 37(1), (3) and (6)\n&#xa0;S. \n37 \n(1) \nSubsection (3) applies to a contract to provide digital content \nif before the contract is made the consumer makes known to the trader (expressly or by implication) any particular purpose for which the consumer is contracting for the digital content.\n&#xa0;\nS. \n37 \n(3) \nThe contract is to be treated as including a term that the\n digital content is reasonably fit for that purpose, whether or not that is a purpose for which digital content of that kind is usually provided.\n&#xa0;\nS. \n37 \n(6)\n              \nA contract to provide digital content may be treated as making provision about\n \nthe fitness of the d\nigital content for a particular purpose as a matter of custom.\n&#xa0;\nUKCTA has members whose business model involves the immediate delivery to \nconsumers \nof digital content, namely digital television content. \nThis is something now offered by all the main consume\nr facing brands on the sector. \nOur members have \ns\nignificant \nconcerns about these \nprovisions and how they will impact on transactions where \nconsumers \nreceive immediate delivery of content at the point of purchase.\n \n&#xa0;\nTypically such transactions involve the p\nrovision of information as to the nature of the content to \nconsumers \nin order that they can make a decision as to whether or not to purchase the content. But t\nhese subsections \nlisted above would introduce for \nconsumers \nthe opportunity to inform suppliers t\nhat they intend to use the digital content for a particular purpose\n. As currently designed, digital content delivery platforms do not then allow providers the opportunity envisaged in the draft bill to \nrespond as to whether or not the digital content \nis in\n fact \nindeed fit for the consumers’ stated purpose. \nWorst still the sub sections require the providers to consider whether an express purpose may have been im\npl\nied by the \nconsumer\n. In a world where \n \nconsumers \nexpect, and are given, immediate delivery of di\ngital content, these sub sections are completely out of step and inappropriate. \n&#xa0;\nThese concerns apply not only to transactions for TV content involving UKCTA members but perhaps even more significantly (given the volume of transactions involved) to purcha\nses of smart phone apps via providers such as the Apple App Store, Google Play and Amazon. \n&#xa0;\nFor example, if a consumer was looking at a\n smart phone app \nwhich was \nof limited functionality but the \nconsumer \nemailed the supplier and either expressly or \nimpliedly de\nscribed a more complex purpose \nfor which they intended to use the app, \nand then immediately downloaded it, under the draft\ning\n currently proposed\n, that App would be deemed fit for that purpose and if it did no\nt perform to the standard the \nconsum\ner\n \nhad stated, he would have a course of action against the supplier.\n In order to protect against exposu\nre to such risk we imagine that, if implemented as currently drafted, \nthe regulations \nmight\n force \nsuppliers of digital content to redesign their deliver\ny platforms to mitigate the risks. Such changes would not enhance the consumer’s purchasing \nexperience;\n we imagine it would be quite the reverse.\n&#xa0;\nUKCTA believes the current drafting is simply not suitable for a market which \ntypically\n involves immediate de\nlivery of digital content to order. Rather than the wording currently proposed UKCTA believes it would be more appropriate to require suppliers to provide greater transparency and information as to the quality and any intended purpose of digital content an\nd to require suppliers to ensure that the content is \nfit for \nany such \npurpose stated by the supplier\n. \n&#xa0;\nF\nailing which\n, if th\ne Government is minded to persevere with the current \ndrafting, \nsuppliers ought to be given an opportunity to respond within a reason\nable period to \nthe consumer and either affirm the consumer’s stated purpose or to explain that the digital content is not suitable for the purpose stated by the consumer \nbefore\n the consumer purchases the content.  If the consumer does not wait for a respon\nse from the trader before purchasing the digital content, the contract should not be treated as including a term that the digital content is reasonably fit for the consumer’s stated purpose.\n We envisage however that such a regime could only work if content\n delivery systems were modified to add an additional \norder step requiring \nconsumers \nto notify suppliers of their intended purpose, and this would inevitably result in delayed delivery of the content. We do not believe this would be regarded as a positive d\nevelopment by consumers. \n&#xa0;\nAs already noted above UKCTA \nhas concerns \nabout the use of \nthe term “as a matter of custom”\n and these concerns apply equally to Section \n36(6).  A\ns with our earlier comment on this point \nwe would suggest deleting this subsection.\n&#xa0;\nUKCTA believes that \nthe reference to a “reasonable period of time” in this subsection could be \ninterpreted by some \nconsumers as overriding the enforceability of express limitations br\nought to the consumer’s attention pr\nior to the point of \npurchase.  For example, if digital content provided by way of a streaming service is \noften \nmade available for a short period of time\n. \nIn those examples with which UKCTA members are familiar \nthis is ma\nde clear to the consumer\n \npr\nior to the point of sale. The period of validity of the content is another factor weighed up by the consumer in determining whether or not to purchase and it should not therefore be open to \nthe consumer \nto seek to use a statutory\n \nprovision to argue that the period \nset by the seller \nwas unreasonable.  \nUKCTA believes that the wording\n should\n be clarified to ensure that such a right would only occur where a seller \ndid not make clear prior to the sale the \ntime period for which the \ncont\nent would be available for streaming by the consumer. \n&#xa0;\nS\n.\n52 - Information provided about the trader or service to be treated as binding \n&#xa0;S.\n52 (1) \n              \nEvery\n contract to provide a service is to be treated as including as a term of the contract (whether or not it does so expressly) anything that - \n&#xa0;\n(a) is spoken or written to the consumer by or on behalf of the trader about the trader or the service, and\n&#xa0;\n(b) \nis taken into account by the consumer when deciding to enter into the contract or when making any decision about the service after entering into the contract.\n&#xa0;UKCTA supports any measures designed to ensure that \nconsumers must be provided with correct and \nup to date information on products and services\n.   \nConsumers\n should\n be able to rely on the information they are given\n. Consumers are already \nprotect\ned \nunder the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (the “CPRs”)\n but UKCTA has concerns th\nat \nth\ne\n drafting \nof section 52 may produce \nunintended consequences.  \nIn our Members’ experience many transactions involve occasions when\n customer service agents are chatting to \nconsumers\n \nto give them some background \ninformation on a particular \nproduct or service. \nThe flexibility which companies \ncurrently \nha\nve\n,\n allows agents to talk to consumers in a friendly, personable way\n whilst providing accurate and clear information\n. \nIt would be regrettable if as a result of section 52 \nconsumers\n \nwere greete\nd with completely scripted and wooden responses because agents were too wary to engage in any other conversation.\n&#xa0;\nOur member companies \ndevote significant time and \neffort in training \ncustomer service agents to make the \nconsumer’s\n \ninteraction with \nthem as e\nasy and pleasant \nas possible. \nInevitably, there will be some\n \nessential \ninformation \nwhich is \nscripted which must be shared with the \nconsumer\n \nso that they fully understand their rights and obligations\n, for example key contractual information so that the con\nsumer understands their rights and \nobligations and\n so that the Communications Provider can be sure of compliance with existing \nconsumer protection and Ofcom regulation\ns\n.\n Typically telephone based \nconversations are followed up by \na postal delivery\n or \nemail \nof\n service or product as well as \ncontractual information\n. This \nalready involves \nthe opportunity to cancel the order if the \nconsumer\n \nchanges their mind within the cooling off period\n specified in existing regulations\n. \n&#xa0;\nIt is possible that although our members do their utmost to ensure their staff do \nnot mislead p\notential \ncustomers, \nsection 52 as currently drafted, would lead to the only prudent course of action being to ensure that contact centre \nagents \nstick rigidly \nto \na \npre prepared \nscript and not to engage with \nconsumers\n \nany further than that, in order to ensure that no unscripted comments were to form part of the contract.  \nThis would in our view lead to a poorer \nconsumer \nexperience across the sector.\n&#xa0;\nAlternatively C\nPs might have to go through the entire contract on the phone with a \nconsumer;\n again we do not believe this would be welcomed by consumers any more than it would be by our members. Our members already do \nhighlight the main terms of the agreement; for exampl\ne the price, minimum term\n, product being purchased\n etc.  \nFull \ncontractual documentation \nis then sent allowing \nconsumers \nto \nconsider it \nwithin the cooling off period. \nConsumers \nare used to transacting in this way and we believe they understand that t\nhe term\ns and conditions \nwhich they receive by post \nconstitute the final contract. \nThey also have the \nopportunity to cancel the contract within any applicable cooling off period. \nAgain this right is increasingly well understood by \nconsumers\n. The consequence of sec\ntion 52 would be that \nconsumers\n \nwere \nable to add additional terms \nto their contract based on their conversation with the contact centre. Each \nconsumer \nwould in effect have a bespoke contract. This would be confusing and would be an enormous administrative \nburden on service providers. The additional costs of recording such bespoke arrangements would be significant and costs would inevitably be passed on in some form or other to consumers. \n&#xa0;\nThere is a considerable body of consumer protection law already whic\nh UKCTA believes adequately protects consumers today. Communications Providers are regulated sector specific regulations and in particular General Condition 9 of the General Conditions of Entitlement regime monitored by Ofcom. This condition sets out certa\nin mandatory provisions which must be included in consumer contracts. \n&#xa0;\nFurther p\nrotection against \nmisrepresentation \nis provided \nby the law of misrepresentation, the CPRs and in addition, the cooling off periods provided for under the current Door Stop \nSelling Regulations\n and \nthe Consumer Protection (\nDistance Selling\n) \nRegulations\n 2000\n (to be replaced by the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Payments) Re\ngulations) that allow \nconsumers\n \nto change their minds if they are unhappy with the products or services or the terms of the contract.  \n&#xa0;\nAlthough the Government has reasoned that clarification to consumer rights is important because ‘consumers are more lik\nely to suffer detriment they are unable to resolve’, for the communications industry that is simply not the case. As part of the General Conditions of Entitlement regime all communications providers are required to be part of an ADR scheme; \nthese arrangeme\nnts are widely regarded as effective and the ADR schemes are well utilised by consumers. \n&#xa0;\nWe consider that this additional layer of consumer protection \nis unnecessary and disproportionate. \n&#xa0;\nS\n.\n 67 (2) &amp; (4) - \nExclusion from assessment of fairness  \n&#xa0;S.\n67\n \n(2)\n              \nSubsection (1) excludes a term from an assessment under section 65(1) only if it is transparent and prominent.\nS.\n67\n \n(4)\n   \nA term is prominent for the purposes of this section if it is brought to the consume\nr’s\n \nattention in such a way that an average consumer would be aware of the term.\n&#xa0;\nUKCTA has\n some concerns about the requirement for price terms to be “prominent” in order to be within the exemption under section 65(1) so that the term\n is not assessable for\n fairness. In the electronic communications sector \nconsumers \nfrequently purchase a “\nbundle” of services, \nand not infrequently they may initially purchase a primary service such as telephony but subsequently supplement this with a service such as broadband,\n superfast broadband or increasingly a TV service. These are often \npriced separately but form part of the same contracts\n. UKCTA is\n concern\ned\n that under the Bill, charges could be subject to an assessment of fairness if they are not brought to the average c\nonsumer’s attention at the time of entering into a contract.\n&#xa0;\nFor example most of the major consumer focussed CPs \noffer \na variety of \nfixed-line telephony \npackages.\n  \nThese typically require the consumer to pay \na monthly subscription cost \nin return for a telephony service and an inclusive allowance \nwhich allows the \nconsumer\n \nto make various types of calls without additional charge, e.g. evening and weekend calls to landline\n numbers within the UK, or calls to overseas landlines, or to mobile \nphones\n.  \nThis is standard practi\nc\ne within the industry and indeed it is difficult to find a service which does not offer some form of calls allowance.  In addition to calls covered by the bundled allowance, these services also \n \nallow \nconsumers \nto \nmake call\ns which do not fall within the inclusive usage allowance.  Although the most \ncommon or \npopular call charges \ncan (and are) \nbe brought prominently to the \nconsumer’s\n \nattention, it \nis simply \nimpractical \nduring the sales process \nto \ndraw a \nconsumer’s \nattention t\no every possible \ncall charge\n which the \nconsumer \nmight incur. The best that can be done is to refer a \nconsumer \nto standard price lists detailing such charges. \n&#xa0;\nAs currently drafted section 67 would mean that any\n call charges not brought to the average cons\numer’s attention at the point of sale, would not fall within the price exemption.\n&#xa0;\nUKCTA fears this will \n considerably lengthen \nsales \ncall\ns\n, and \nin so doing reduce the likelihood that the \nconsumer \nwill absorb other \nmore importan\nt information provided durin\ng the call as they will have simply switched off through boredom while they are given\n information about charges they may or may not incur at a point in the future. \n&#xa0;\nCPs already routinely \nrefer \nconsumers\n \nto pricing information on their website \nin cases whe\nre such \ninformation changes regularly\n. An example of this would be \ncharges for directory enquiry calls which change frequently due to circumstances \nbeyond \n \nthe control of the \nCP. In such cases it is nigh on impossible \nto provide \nconsumers\n \nwith up-to-date information in hard copy documents. \nIndeed the risk of providing out of date information would increases with the use of hard copy rather than electronic information about such charges. \nWould \nsuch electronic information be \nconsidered to be \nsufficiently \n\"prominent\" that the average consumer would be aware of it and so within the exemption in \ns65 (\n1)\n?\n  \nThis seems to UKCTA to be far from clear. \nWe \nwould welcome further clarity on these points. We understand from the BIS workshops that BIS will \nbe discussing this issue with Ofcom to assess the impact on the communications sector. We support transparency for c\nonsumers\n but we would caution against measures which are impractical to implement.\n&#xa0;\nS.71 \n(2) If a term of a consumer contract is especially onerous or unusual, the trader must ensure that the term is drawn particularly to the consumer’s attention.\n&#xa0;\nS.71 \n(3) Whether a term of a contract is especially onerous or unusual is to be determined,\n in particular, by reference to the subject matter of the contract.\n&#xa0;UKCTA has\n similar concerns under s71 (2) to those \nwhich we expressed above in relation to \nsection s67 (4). As explained\n above\n, communications providers\n typically have an extensive \ntariff guide detailing the call charges to all \ntypes of number range and to \ninternational destinations.  \nWhat may be “unusual” for one person may be entirely normal for another. For example most c\nonsu\nmers will never have any occasion to call Kiribati and s\no calls to that country would indeed be out of the ordinary, whereas a \nconsumer \nwith a friend or relative there might find nothing at all unusual in such calls. The Bill’s use \nof the term “unusual” \ndoes little to provide clarity or certainty of what is req\nuired. How are UKCTA members to determine which call charges are unusual and there must be \n“drawn particularly to the consumer’s attention”. This is an even higher test than the “prominence” test under s65 (4)\n. \n&#xa0;\nWe understand from one of our members who a\nttended that a\nt one of the \nrecent \nworkshops\n on this topic,\n BIS confirmed that s71 applied at the time the contract was concluded which would mean that for telephone sales, the agents would be required to read out any “unusual” call charges.   \nUKCTA cannot \nbelieve that \nthis is BIS’ intention but the unintended consequences may be that in the communications sector, in order to avoid the price terms of call charges being assessable for fairness, providers are required to bring all “unusual” charges to the cons\numer’s attention thereby \nnullifying any attempt to give prominence to terms which ought properly to be highlighted for consumers. \n&#xa0;\nWe understand the Government’s desire to enhance consumer protection but we do not believe that a one size fits \nall approach necessarily works. Certain protections, which may operate without any great difficulty in one scenario, may cause difficulties for both providers and consumers in another. In those areas which we have highlighted above, we believe that the spe\ncific measures proposed will cause difficulty in relation to services which involve the immediate delivery of digital content. It is easy to envisage them requiring changes to the delivery systems which will degrade rather than enhance the consumer’s use o\nf the services. \n&#xa0;\nUKCTA believes that the Government ought to look very carefully at the issues we have highlighted and to consider whether in these limited areas, the electronic communications sector ought to be exempt from these particular regulations.  \nT\nhere is \nalready established \nprecedent for this course of action within BIS’s attempts to implement the Regulations.  \nRegulation 6 provides that the Regulations do\n \nn\no\nt apply to contracts for services of a banking, insurance or\n&#xa0;\ninvestment nature.\n&#xa0;\n \nUKCTA und\nerstands this approach was adopted because Government felt that \nregulation of the financial sector was better addressed through sector specific legislation. \nUKCTA believes that the practical difficulties which we have described suggest that the same approa\nch ought to be followed in relation to the Electronic Communications sector. \n&#xa0;\n13\n September 2013\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n \nThe Consumer Protection (Cancellation of Contracts concluded away from Business\n \nPremises) Regulations 1987 [as amended by The Consumer Protection (Cancellation of\n \nContracts Concluded away from Business Premises)\n \n(Amendment) Regulations 1988 \nand 1998]\n"
