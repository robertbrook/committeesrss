[[[Summary ]]]&#xa0;The Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority supports the submission made by National Parks England, on behalf of English National Park Authorities.  &#xa0;This submission is intended to provide more detail in relation to the points made in that submission about Traffic Regulation Orders (TRO).  Specifically:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Comments on ]]]

[[[Section 18 Ascertainment of public rights of way: procedure]]]&#xa0;Section 18 outlines changes to the procedures for ascertaining public rights of way.  This includes simplifying the process to give clarity where there is agreement on changes that should be made to the Definitive Map.&#xa0;The Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority asks that the Committee considers including, within this section, a provision to simplify the process of revoking a Traffic Regulation Order (TRO) made in relation to s.22BB(1) of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984.  Specifically where it prevents use by mechanically propelled vehicles, on an unsealed route, and where later a Definitive Map Modification Order (DMMO) is made under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and clarifies that there are no public rights for mechanically propelled vehicles.  At this point the TRO no longer serves its intended purpose.  However, to revoke the TRO in these circumstances requires the instigation and complete reverse of the consultation and advertising procedures laid out in The National Park Authorities’ Traffic Orders (Procedure) (England) Regulations 2007 SI 2007 No 2542.  It would be in the spirit of the Bill if a TRO, in these circumstances, could be revoked ‘automatically’ when a DMMO is made as outlined above.  We ask that such a provision be applied retrospectively.  &#xa0;

[[[Evidence]]]&#xa0;The Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority has made 10 TROs which have the effect of preventing public use by mechanically propelled vehicles on unsealed routes.  It has recently undertaken a review of these TROs and found them to be very effective in achieving their intended purpose of preserving the amenity, and/or conserving the special qualities of the area through which the routes pass.  (A hyperlink of the Authority’s report of the review is appended for

[[[Appendix 1]]]).  At the time of making the TROs, (most were made in 2008), all of these routes had either proven or possible public rights for motor vehicles.  In respect of two of the routes there have since been Definitive Map Modification Orders that have clarified that those routes do not have public rights for motor vehicles along their full length.  Therefore they cannot be used as through routes by recreational motor vehicles and the TROs are no longer needed.  The Authority is seeking to revoke these TROs.  However, the legislation to revoke a TRO, as it currently stands, is very onerous, because of the number that are likely to be received and the staff resource required to undertake the consultations and respond in accordance with the National Park Authorities’ Traffic Orders (Procedure) (England) Regulations 2007.  &#xa0;The hyperlink of the report attached at 

[[[Appendix 2]]] shows the number and complexity of responses we received when we last made a TRO.  We understand that the Peak District National Park Authority, as part of their more recent TRO consultations, have received ten times this number.&#xa0;In considering this issue we also draw attention to the need for secondary legislation in relation to the National Park Authorities’ Traffic Orders (Procedure) (England) Regulations 2007 SI 2007 No 2542 regulation 14.  Before deciding whether to make an order, the National Park Authority must consider all representations made under the Regulations.  Within 14 days after making an order a National Park Authority must give notice in writing that the order has been made to any person who made representations under regulation 7.  Where a person objected to the Order and the National Park Authority did not accede to those objections, the National Park Authority must give its reasons for not so acceding in the notice given to that person.  The individual nature and complexity of the consultation responses, means that writing to each individual addressing the points they had raised is the clearest way of discharging this duty.  It would be much better, however, if the Regulations allowed the National Park Authority to simply point the individual to a summary report. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Conclusion ]]]&#xa0;In conclusion, as part of the commitment to reduce red tape and the deregulatory process the Yorkshire dales National Park Authority would like to see measures to simplify the TRO making and revoking process on unsealed routes in National Parks.  &#xa0;&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
