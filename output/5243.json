"&#xa0;\nDIS 60&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by Africa Network Campaign on Education For All&#xa0;Quality Education For All Falls Short If Children With Disabilities Are ExcludedIntroductionAfrica Network Campaign on Education For All (ANCEFA) is a voluntary, non-partisan and not-for profit network of national civil society organizations in Africa championing the cause \nof \nquality education for all\n (EFA)\n. The membership currently stand\ns\n at 35 national education coalitions, each of them constituting diverse membership including NGOs, Teachers Unions, Human Rights, Child Rights and Education Rights Activists, Media Practitioners, Researchers, Academia, Community Based Organisations and sub-thematic networks.\n&#xa0;\nANCEFA envisions a \nLiterate and Empowered Africa\n where Quality Education For All is a reality enjoyed by all children, youth and adults, without any hindrances whatsoever. In order to realize its dream, ANCEFA’s mandate is to enhance \nthe \ncapacity of African Civil Society to pus\nh \nefficiently and effectively  for universal access to quality education and development through campaign\ning\n, advocacy, networking, research and resource mobilization.\n&#xa0;\nANCEFA strives to support the emergence of vibrant civil society networks, coalitions and alliances that critically engage in EFA processes at the local, national, regional and international levels, among other core objectives\n;\n and deploys such strategies as coalition building and strengthening, capacity development  \nin \ncampaign\ning\n, lobbying, advocacy, research, networking, and policy analysis, information management, facilitating local, national, regional and international policy dialogues, partnership building, and elections and budget advocacy, among others\n.\n&#xa0;\nStrategic Campaign Focus of ANCEFAIn its current strategic plan, ANCEFA focuses on \ne\nducation \nf\ninancing and \ni\nnclusion (\nw\norking with \np\narliamentarians and \np\nolitical \np\narties and \nb\nuilding EFA \nc\nhampions), \nn\national and \nl\nocal \na\nccountability via \np\nublic \ne\nxpenditure \nt\nracking \ns\nurvey\ns\n and \np\narticipatory \ns\nchool \ng\novernance, \np\nromoting \nq\nuality/\nl\nearning \no\nutcomes with \nt\neachers, \ny\nouth and \nv\nolunteers, \np\narents, and the \nm\nedia as strategic partners; \ns\ntrategic policy engagement for meaningful change in policy and practice around \nearly childhood care and development\n, \nuniversal primary education\n, \no\nut of \ns\nchool \ny\nouth, \ng\nirls\n’\n \na\nccess, \nr\netention and \nc\nompletion, and \na\ndult and \nc\nontinuing \nl\nearning; EFA \nm\nonitoring through Education Watch; and Overseas Development Aid \na\ngenda tracking\n.\n&#xa0;\nWhy Inclusion is the way to go for governments, and donor aid should target thisFor the period  2009 – 2012, ANCEFA\n,\n with the support of Save the Children UK, undertook an action-oriented survey in the E\nconomic \nC\nommunity \nO\nf \nW\nest \nA\nfrican \nS\ntates (ECOWAS)\n region of Africa to underscore the significance of  inclusive \ne\nducation\n,\n and how it would accelerate  access to quality \ne\nducation by children with disabilities. \nMany children\n,\n \nof \nwhom most are psychologically or physically disabled\n,\n are prevented from going to school simply because no one thought about integrating adapted learning, teaching and construction facilities to accommodate them. \nNot less that 5% of the total children population in the countries of the region have been projected to have one disability or another (ANCEFA Report ECOWAS, 2013)\nThe first shocking revelation is that there is absolutely no reliable \ndisaggregated \ndata \n showing\n  statistics \non the number \nof  disabled children, \nless \n \nstill \non the nature of \ntheir \ndisability. ANCEFA and partners thus heavily rooted for an inclusive \ne\nducation process that would ensure that EVERY child is in school\n,\n and LEARNING. Development partners have thus been called upon to support the process\n,\n with governments being asked to take the lead\n,\n since delivery of \ninclusive education \n should be the top priority of every government\n.\n&#xa0;\nFurther, disabled children and girls in rural areas do not go to school and in urban areas, special schools are insufficient. Consequently, most disabled children are totally excluded from the educational system.\n&#xa0;\nInclusive \ne\nducation relates to all children accessing and meaningfully participating in quality \ne\nducation in ways that are responsive to their individual needs. Inclusive education is therefore expected to meet EVERYONE’s rights to Education.\n&#xa0;\nIt is universally agreed that every child has a fundamental right to \ne\nducation\n and that every child CAN Learn. Further every stakeholder\n,\n and \nevery \nlead agenc\ny, \n including governments and donor aid agencies\n,\n should acknowledge and respect differences in children. Education structures, systems and methodologies must meet the needs of \nall \n children, and where historically disabled children have been discriminated against, schools have to accommodate children with special educational needs and redress the past imbalance\n.\n&#xa0;\nIncreasing awareness and vigilance among communities, enhancing capacity building of MPs and journalists on inclusive education, budget tracking and child rights, advocacy on inclusive education and increased budget allocations, popularization of instruments and texts on children\ns’\n rights, \nand \nsensitization and lobbying using diverse means should help address the problem\n.\n&#xa0;\nNational and international partnerships need to be enhanced to tackle the perennial exclusion of the children with disability from education. A call to all international aid agencies to promote this would be a welcome move.\n&#xa0;\n12 December 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n              \n&#xa0;\n International instruments governing Education e.g.\nUDHR, UNCRC, African Charter on the Rights and Wellbeing of the Child\n&#xa0;\n"
