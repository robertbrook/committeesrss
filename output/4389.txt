&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence from esure Group plc (CMI0009)&#xa0;

[[[Executive Summary]]]&#xa0;esure Group plc is a top 10 personal lines insurer providing private car insurance to over 1.3million UK customers through its core brands, esure and Sheilas’ Wheels, plus the smaller First Alternative brand. We are active members of the Association of British Insurers and represented on the ABI’s General Insurance Council. &#xa0;We submitted a detailed response to the original call for evidence by the Transport Select Committee and this paper should be read in conjunction with that response. In addition, we also responded to the Ministry of Justice Consultation regarding the cost and frequency of whiplash claims.&#xa0;As a major UK motor insurer we experience first hand the challenges outlined by both the committee and the MOJ in dealing with fraudulent and exaggerated whiplash claims, the cost of which is a major consideration when setting premium levels for UK consumers. Whilst we take the view that some progress has been made in reducing the costs associated with whiplash claims, there remains more work to do, particularly around tackling fraud.&#xa0;We note the concerns of the Transport Select Committee that there is a desire for clarity around how some of the proposals made thus far will be taken forward. In addition, a further request has been made for stakeholders to set out what more can be done to tackle the whiplash issue.&#xa0;Whilst we have reviewed and contributed to the response formulated by our trade body, the Association of British Insurers, this papers sets out our views on the key issues arising from the debate for the consideration of the committee.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Discussion]]]&#xa0;Why is Further Reform Needed?&#xa0;The starting point when considering the way ahead is to look at the original motivation for trying to reform and improve the compensation system for genuinely injured claimants. The statistics speak for themselves in that the UK population makes a disproportionately higher number of whiplash claims when compared to other European countries.&#xa0;The insurance industry has long campaigned for a system with more teeth to tackle spurious personal injury claims and Government has responded by making a number of changes to the funding of personal injury claims. There can be no dispute that car insurance premiums have been falling over the last 12-months and the latest Confused.Com/Towers Watson Car Insurance Price Index points to a 13.9% reduction over this period.&#xa0;Therefore, it is clear that the industry has been delivering on its promise to offer lower premiums for UK consumers. This has been achieved despite increases in personal injury awards of over 20% in the last 18-months alone.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;There is a clear need for further reform if the savings delivered for consumers are to be sustainable in the medium term and we believe the following are key areas for Government to focus on.&#xa0;Increase in the Small Claims Track&#xa0;We share the committee’s apparent view that the MOJ has been too dismissive of the possibility of raising the Small Claims Track (SCT) limit given that such a small proportion of personal injury claims now fall to be dealt with under the SCT. The current limit has been in place since 1991 and the latest statistics suggest that only 9% of PI claims are dealt with by the SCT.&#xa0;By definition, the SCT is designed and intended for simple, straightforward low value disputes. It is our considered view that straightforward, genuine whiplash claims do not necessarily require the assistance of a Lawyer and claimants should be given an alternative route to compensation. There is often scepticism when an insurer offers to deal with a claimant directly and we believe that the platform for the electronic handling of claims is already in place and that this, when coupled with standardised medico-legal reports, will provide a solution that is fit for purpose and will deliver cost and efficiency benefits. The bulk of whiplash claims do not entail complex legal issues.&#xa0;We strongly believe that Government should look again at increasing the SCT to £5,000 and consider the solutions put forward by the industry that will address any concerns around access to justice. The solutions include:&#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; An improved system of education so that the public have awareness and visibility around how to make a claim, should they ever need to do so.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The mandatory use by claimants and defendants of a software based damages calibration tool ensuring consistent and transparent levels of personal injury damages.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The option of staff to be employed by the Portal Co to process paper claims for those without access to the internet or a personal preference to deal in paper.&#xa0;We believe that this is the biggest opportunity missed by the MOJ and we would urge the committee to probe deeper into the decision to defer any increase for the time being.&#xa0;Tackling Fraud&#xa0;As referred to previously, we share the concerns of the industry that more assistance is needed in tackling the problem of fraud. The ABI is seeking to share greater amounts of data with organisations such as the Motor Accident Solicitors Society (MASS), the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers (APIL), Motor Insurers Bureau (MIB) and the Law Society but this focus is very much on facilitating the detection of fraud.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;A significant difficulty for compensators however is the way in which the Courts deal with fraudulent claims once they have been identified and it is submitted that the Judgment in Summers v Fairclough Holmes (2012) highlights the barriers faced by compensators. The Court concluded that the strike out of a claim on account of fraud is permissible but only at the conclusion of the claim in ‘exceptional circumstances’ by which point substantial legal costs have been incurred. The compensator rarely recovers such costs.&#xa0;We would like to see the law reformed in the area of fraud in personal injury claims with the default position being automatic strike out of a claim where exaggeration or fraud is proven. We urge Government to give approval to the Law Commission proposal to undertake further work in this area.&#xa0;Progressing Reform of Medico-legal Reporting&#xa0;We fully support Government proposals to reform medico-legal reporting in low value claims. A perverse system has developed whereby those preparing the reports are financially incentivised for firstly making a diagnosis of whiplash and then arguably some will secure greater levels of work by providing the lengthiest prognosis period. &#xa0;We are very much of the view that medico-legal reform is one of the easier issues to tackle given the apparent large areas of agreement between the ABI and MASS, the Association of Medical Report Associations (AMRO) and the Forum of Insurance Lawyers (FOIL). We strongly advocate engagement and collaboration between the parties in order to bring absolute financial independence between the medic and those instructing them. Improved training and a system of accreditation is very much needed so that those compiling reports on whiplash actually understand the condition. Standardised instructions (including documentary evidence around the accident itself), reporting and a system of audit/peer review are all essential elements of successful reform in our opinion.&#xa0;Whilst improving the quality and accuracy of medico-legal reports is of paramount importance, the cost of medico-legal reporting is also in need of urgent review. Whilst informal agreements are in place in the form of the AMRO Agreement, there is general acknowledgment that the fees are not enforceable and the Courts regularly depart from these rates and award higher amounts. As with the level of legal costs payable to lawyers, the costs payable for medico-legal reports are now at artificially high levels. Referral fees were previously paid within the current fee structure, so it is clear that excess cost remains within the system. We support an evaluation of the true costs involved in producing a medico-legal report and following consultation/agreement the level of fees payable should be fixed within the CPR.&#xa0;Whilst we accept entirely that your recent call for evidence touches upon other areas outside the scope of this response, we have concentrated on the key areas, which we believe will make a real demonstrable difference in tackling fraud, reducing frequency and containing costs. &#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
