[[[Introduction ]]]&#xa0;

[[[How has antimicrobial resistance developed in the past decade?]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[What are the gaps in our knowledge about antimicrobial resistance?]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Is there sufficient research and investment into new antibiotics or other treatments and methods to ensure continued protection against infection? If not, how could this be rectified?]]]&#xa0;In view of the serious situation relating to AMR, multiple lines of investigation should be taken. This should also include natural product research (e.g. actinomycetes and fungi), and other strategies (e.g. bacteriophage therapy for the treatment of bacterial infections). Pricing of antimicrobial drugs is an area that requires reconsideration. Despite their life-saving properties, antibiotics are relatively inexpensive compared with drugs for cancer and chronic diseases. Furthermore, the emergence of antimicrobial resistance places a constraint on market longevity.  This combination represents a strong disincentive to the development of new antibiotics.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[What measures (including behavioural change) have been most effective in controlling the spread of resistant pathogens, and could such measures be used to control other pathogens?]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[What global coordination and action is required to fight antimicrobial resistance and is the UK contributing enough towards cross-border initiatives?]]]The World Health Organisation already has some global surveillance programmes in place for specific pathogens e.g. influenza viruses (to inform vaccine design), M. tuberculosis and HIV (for drug resistance). However, with the exception of influenza surveillance these do not provide data with sufficient speed to allow for the timely implementation of interventions. The European CDC also conducts surveillance schemes for AMR (EARS-Net) and antimicrobial consumption (ESAC-Net). However, participation is voluntary and the number of participating laboratories submitting data varies from year to year, resulting in biased sampling. The pharmaceutical industry has also set up some initiatives e.g. Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART), which is funded by MSD. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[What are the strengths and weaknesses of the Government’s 2013-2018 strategy for tackling antimicrobial resistance? What changes might be made to further strengthen the Government’s action plan?]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;All of these would be best served by parallel working in the veterinary sphere.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;This response was prepared by Professor Sharon Peacock, supported by the CID coordinator (Ms Anna Davies) and informed by the CID Fellows and including input from the PHG Foundation.&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
