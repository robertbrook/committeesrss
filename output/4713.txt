[[[Executive Summary]]]Our experience in the pre-opening phase, so far, has been that the process for establishing a free school allows a parent-led proposal, without a sponsor or teaching expertise, to attract the necessary support and expertise. The heads of two highly regarded existing schools and their staff generously provided free advice and some at-cost services because they wanted children beyond their own establishments to get the benefit of their demonstrable experience and knowledge. Successful schools are likely to want to see their best practice spread more widely and guiding a free school achieves this. The London Diocesan Board for Schools also provided advice and at-cost services, without asking for faith entrance criteria or intruding upon our policies or approach. Our local authority was helpful in integrating our admissions process closely with their own. The New Schools Network demonstrated how much has already been learnt and converted into guidance which greatly helps proposers.Â   We found the Department easy to work with in the circumstances, though the timetable for setting up the school is demanding. The fact that the EFA takes all responsibility for negotiating sites, though necessary, can make it hard to reassure parents that a site will be found. We would recommend a form of assurance for proposer groups to be able to give out to parents, without jeopardising site negotiations. December 2013&#xa0;
