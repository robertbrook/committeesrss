[[[How do Government and local authorities identify demand for passenger transport in ]]]

[[[isolated communities (including rural and urban areas and island communities)?]]]&#xa0;Given the rural nature of the County and the high distances that people travel to access services in the Key Service Centres, Cumbria County Council has difficulty in meeting the travel needs of all its residents.  The County Council is required to allocate funding to provide home to school, special needs and transport for social care clients.  In addition there is support for bus services where these are not provided commercially and for community transport to provide options when conventional services are not available.  Following work that was done using the Accession model to identify areas where there was not good access to scheduled bus services, it was agreed that it would be helpful to define a level of service that could be sustained by the Council particularly with regard to meeting the needs of more remote communities.&#xa0;This review looked at 790 communities across the County and mapped the available transport provision, where essential services (eg doctors, schools) were situated and where people needed to travel for various purposes.  The aim was to provide a transport network which took into account both bus and rail services (the County has a good rail network).  This led to the Council having agreed criteria for the support of scheduled bus services when they were not provided commercially.  Over 90% of bus services in Cumbria are provided commercially in the main by Stagecoach.&#xa0;The criteria are still applied and take account of the likely sustainability of bus services where there a few people likely to travel.  In some cases where need is identified funding can sometimes be provided on a short term basis to determine whether there is a likelihood that a scheduled bus services will be viable on a longer term basis.  Whilst it is recognised that there may be a need for continued support a value for money criteria is applied as any bus service supported by the County Council needs to have an agreed ratio of fares collected to cost.&#xa0;The County Council is not aware how central government identifies demand for passenger transport.  They will however have information on numbers travelling on concessionary bus passes as regular reports are provided by Cumbria County Council to the Department for Transport.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[To what extend are the needs of different groups of passengers (e.g. people with disabilities, older people, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?]]]&#xa0;In determining the provision to more isolated communities the County Council has over many years developed a range of solutions.  Where scheduled bus services are unlikely to be sustainable even with considerable financial support the transport provision is primarily demand-responsive.  There is an extensive network of Voluntary Car Schemes which are coordinated locally by volunteer coordinators.  In order to supplement the provision of transport for volunteers the County Council provides the “Rural Wheels” service which utilises the down time of small commercial providers.  Anyone over the age of 16 is eligible provided they do not have a scheduled bus service.  Management information regarding this service assists the County Council in providing evidence regarding patterns of travel from isolated communities.   Transport can be tailored to accommodate differing passenger needs within the agreed framework but passengers are required to be as flexible as possible regarding travel times, and occasionally days of the week to ensure the transport resource is utilised as efficiently as possible.&#xa0;

[[[What are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities? How can these challenged be overcome?]]]&#xa0;The availability of funding to provide additional improvements to bus services is the largest challenge as there is not sufficient demand to either run or enhance services without subsidy.  De-regulation of the transport network has resulted in commercial operators selecting the most profitable routes which tend to be in the more urban or densely populated areas leaving isolated communities to look to the local authority to meet their transport needs.  In addition where additional housing has been built in urban areas the nature of these developments do not always consider the needs of operators to be able to serve the areas by bus.  The County Council works where possible with District and Borough Councils as well as developers to encourage sustainable transport through the Travel Planning process.&#xa0;The County Council’s aim is to integrate transport services that are statutorily required and contracts packages of work to link Home to School or Adult Social Care transport with supported scheduled bus services. &#xa0;Increasingly the travel needs in the county have become more diverse as people travel in many different directions to work and services rather than along the traditional routes to the employment in the nearest Key Service Centre.  &#xa0;The County Council became responsible two years ago for administering the English National Concessionary Travel Scheme.  In Cumbria there is a high proportion of use by concessionaires of scheduled bus services.  On the commercial services on average around 38% of passengers are concessionary.  On some routes many of these in rural areas the proportion is much higher.  The Council had challenges during the first year to provide adequate funding to reimburse bus operators.  Consequently a decision was taken to reduce the reimbursement rate paid to operators from 65% to 58%.  In response to this the main operator (Stagecoach) increased their bus fares to people who travel without concessions.  Unfortunately this lead to a decrease in people using buses and paying fares. In addition there is a high proportion of tourist travel in Cumbria particularly in South Lakeland which adds a significant pressure to the budget.   &#xa0;Recently there has also been a reduction in the amount of BSOG that transport operators have been able to claim and the County Council has been advised by Stagecoach that the reduction in the amount of money available together with other factors including the increasing cost of fuel has made some bus services less viable.&#xa0;Access to Health, both GP and hospital appointments is becoming increasingly challenging.  This is due to a number of factors including the change in eligibility criteria for free patient transport, increased patient choice around where consultations can be made and increased availability of appointment times early in the morning, later in the evening and at weekends.   Cumbria County Council continues to engage with “health” to try and address transport issues from a strategic perspective. Whilst there has been some success, this work has not been made any easier by the continued changes in Health governance structures through the transition from the PCT to Clinical Commissioning Groups.  The provision of transport for patients in Cumbria is currently the responsibility of North West Ambulance Services on contract to the CCG’s.  The County Council has also tried to engage with NWAS to have a collaborative approach to providing transport without success.&#xa0;

[[[How effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passenger]]]

[[[ in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The County Council’s definition of Community Transport is not restricted to Voluntary Social Cars and Community Minibus schemes run under either Section 22 or Section 19 Permits.  It also includes demand-responsive transport provided by Commercial Transport Operators under the umbrella of its Rural Wheels Scheme.  The Rural Wheels scheme provides a flexible transport service which only receives financial support when it operates.  This is cost effective from the Council’s perspective when compared with the relatively high cost of supporting bus services particularly in more remote rural areas where there are few people travelling.  The County Council is only able to support the statutory concessionary travel scheme so concessions are only available on scheduled bus services.&#xa0;The provision of Community Transport other than the Rural Wheels type services relies heavily on volunteers which are easier to recruit in some parts of the county than in others.   The volunteers are required to both drive and coordinate requests within schemes.  Experience has shown when community transport schemes have started to pay staff they have soon become unviable. The development of the Rural Wheels scheme across the County has meant that the Council facilitates/supports transport in all areas irrespective of the availability of volunteers.  The development and ongoing support of Community Transport requires both financial and staffing support to achieve the best results.  In this respect the County Council works closely with communities to develop schemes.

[[[&#xa0;]]]Further flexibility in the S19 permit legislation could improve community transport. Such transport schemes can presently only be used by members of the scheme and are not available to the “general public” which prevents use by tourists and visitors. The County Council is developing a new community transport solution “Community Wheels” which will deliver demand-responsive transport using fully accessible community minibuses in partnership with local communities.  The viability of such services could be increased if visitors were able to have some sort of temporary membership that would allow them to pay to use the service. &#xa0;Opening out membership could increase the patronage and therefore viability of some type of community minibus schemes.   However, this could cause tensions with the small commercial provider taxi who would normally provide transport where scheduled bus services or other transport was not available.  The County Council relies heavily on the availability of a large number of small operators to provide transport for children with special needs and social care clients.&#xa0;

[[[To what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rel]]]

[[[y on taxis and other demand-responsive transport services?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Where scheduled services are not available either commercially or the Council is unable to support these services taxis and demand-responsive transport services provide a flexible solution which is likely to be more appropriate for the user if it is door-to-door.   The County Council’s view is that the issue is less likely to be around whether the service is a bus, taxi or minibus, it is more likely to be because people will have to pay for any alternative to scheduled bus services and also that users will need to pre-book the transport.  

[[[&#xa0;]]]Whilst there is an argument that these services are not comparable to scheduled bus services the Council is clear that there needs to be options for people to travel where these services are not financially sustainable. This does enable all residents in Cumbria to travel for essential services however there are difficulties in providing transport for employment.&#xa0;

[[[What are the main challenges associ]]]

[[[ated with funding transport services in isolated commu]]]

[[[nities? How can these services ]]]

[[[be made more affordable?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The need for ongoing revenue funding at a time when the County Council has a number of pressures in maintaining a range of services including transport, the Council had to take the decision three years ago to withdraw support for some 19 bus services.  These services required considerable subsidy to maintain and in some cases alternatives have been found.  The level of bus fares in parts of the County are an issue and this is largely due to the cost of providing services and the distances travelled.  In addition this situation has not been improved by the availability of ENCTS as operators do not receive full fare reimbursed.  The County Council has in the region of 96,000 residents who have concessionary travel passes and in addition a number of tourists travelling in the County who are eligible for “free” transport.”&#xa0;The County has an ageing population and given the current policy to enable people remain in their own homes for as long as possible this will continue to add demand for transport services and consequent financial pressure to transport budgets.  &#xa0;Services can be made more affordable through efficient planning and coordination of transport requests to make sure that people living in the same area travel at a similar time.  This should generate additional income and reduce the net cost of transport. &#xa0;A more affordable and efficient transport network could be developed through further integration of services.  This would require flexibility to allow some types of service to carry the “general public” for example, non-emergency patient transport being linked with social care transport or to improve access to the local GP. &#xa0;Transport services could be means tested so that only those in receipt of certain benefits receive a subsidised transport service.&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0; This was formally approved by the County Council in 2006
