defaultI was a founder and leader of the original Isle of 
defaultEigg
default Trust that raised £1.6 million and bought 
defaultEigg
default into Community ownership in 1997, setting a template for subsequent community buyouts. I am also currently, or have been until recently, the Visiting Professor of Human Ecology at the University of Strathclyde, an Honorary Fellow at Edinburgh University’s School of Divinity, and a Senior Honorary Research Fellow at the University of Glasgow. My work on land, community and environment is best expressed in my book

defaultAurum
default, London, 2001), described by George 
defaultMonbiot
default as “world-changing” and by Bishop James Jones as “life-changing”.

defaultI am confining my testimony to one simple observation that ties in with points 1, 2 and 4 of the Committee’s remit. In this I simply want to state what may be so obvious that it slips through unsaid in the more specialised testimonies that the committee will receive. In my experience, the greatest benefit, and the prime driver of land reform in modern Scotland, is the psychological and spiritual empowerment that precedes the wider socio-economic and environmental benefits. In a nutshell:
default&#xa0;
defaultCommunity land tenure empowers the people because it re-grounds their capacity, dignity and confidence, opening up access to life’s most basic resource and drawing them from disempowerment to empowerment; towards lives more richly abundant. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMy supporting basis for maintaining this is laid out in the paper which was published in a leading international journal jointly with my former student, 
defaultRutger
default 
defaultHenneman
default, who carried out the field work under my partial supervision with the 
defaultLaw and Governance Group at 
defaultWageningen
default University.

defaultThat italicised statement, above, is all that I need to say. It drives what I have elsewhere
default called the Cycle of Belonging, by which, a) a Sense of Place engenders, b) a Sense of Identity, informing, c) a Sense of Values and from that, motivating d) the Sense of Responsibility that drives change and reconstitutes a damaged Sense of Place.
