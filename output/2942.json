"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Heathrow (WRT 027)\n&#xa0;\nWe are grateful for the opportunity to respond to the Committee’s inquiry into winter resilience in transport. I hope this submission is helpful to the Committee and \nI\n look forward to discussing this work in more detail during the oral evidence session lat\ner this month.\n&#xa0;\nResponding efficiently and effectively to extreme weather conditions is critical to our business and to the UK. Our customers and passengers are our priority and \nHeathrow has robust and tested resilience plans in place for the upcoming wint\ner period. \n&#xa0;\nBut\n, we are not complacent. We\n remain committed to\n learning the lessons of previous periods of \nsevere\n weather, and\n an on-going programme of improvement in efficiency and resilience at the airport.\n This includes working hard in collaboration wi\nth airlines and the airport community to continually improve, test and implement our plans.\n&#xa0;\nIt is impossible, of course, to eliminate entirely the risk of disruption at Heathrow. \nAs airports around the world experience, extreme cold and snow will make som\ne level of disruption inevitable. In addition, a\ns you know, the airport operates at around 99% capacity and there is little flexibility with two intensively used runways to close parts of the airfield for anti-icing or snow clearance without consequences.\n \n&#xa0;\nHowever, passengers and businesses rely on Heathrow every day and we work hard to minimise runway closure periods and to keep our operations running at maximum safe capacity whatever the conditions.\n&#xa0;\nWe have detailed resilience plans during severe \nweather events. They include:\n&#xa0;\nThe Snow Plan documents procedures for preparing and clearing of snow and anti-icing of runways, taxiways and aircraft parking stands at Heathrow. The 2013/14 plan has been created and agreed in collaboration with the airport community, including airlines,\n ground handlers and other on-airport businesses that each play a part in keeping the airport operating. \n&#xa0;\nIncident Response Teams in each part of our business stand ready to deploy during periods of disruption, each with clear command and control objectiv\nes and recovery plans. These teams are exercised regularly and actively participate in evaluation toward a continuous improvement of our plans.\n&#xa0;\nIn addition, we hold Winter Resilience workshops with Heathrow staff and the wider airport businesses. These se\nssions outline the key elements of our plans, responsibilities in the event of an incident and how Heathrow’s command and control structure will co-ordinate this activity on both the airfield and the surrounding infrastructure. \n&#xa0;\nOver the last few years, H\neathrow has invested heavily in equipment, processes and training to better predict and respond to severe weather conditions. Over the last six months, we have invested in:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe know that communicating effectively and quickly with passengers is essential and Heathrow has a dedicated Passenger Communications team that proactively use all traditional and social media to communicate and respond to passengers. This is in addition t\no terminal-based information screens, signage and leaflets that explain to passengers their rights and how to access essential information and services. \n&#xa0;\nTo facilitate this, Heathrow has worked closely with airlines to improve communication between our re\nspective operational teams. Heathrow also has a group of over 850 reservists and third party customer support staff who can be mobilised to assist passengers where airlines cannot. This includes providing essential welfare items (water, food etc.), use of \ntelephones for local/international call and facilities to assist passengers with re-booking and accommodation. \n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
