"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the Police and Crime Commissioner for Cleveland [CST0067]&#xa0;&#xa0;\n \nThe following response has been provided to the Chair of the Public Administration Select Committee who is conducting an inquiry into crime statistics. They are interested in the accuracy of police recorded crime and whether they can have confidence in the crime statistics resulting from this data. More information on the inquiry, including the written and oral evidence received so far, is at \nwww.parliament.uk/pasc\n, under “crime statistics”. In order to inform the inquiry, each Police &amp; Crime Commissioner has been asked to respond to the following questions: \n&#xa0;\n1. \n              \nWhat, if any, targets do you set for your police force? What impact do you think this has on police recording crime practices? \n2. \n              \nHow do you assure yourself that the recorded crime figures for your area are correct? To what extent can you trust the crime statistics for your area? \n&#xa0;\nAs Police &amp; Crime Commissioner for Cleveland, I scrutinise performance against the priorities for the public of my area. \n&#xa0;\nEach December, Cleveland Police develops operational plans for the next year of the Police\n \n&amp; Crime Plan, which set out priority areas to support the Police and Crime Commissioner's\n \nobjectives. The way the Force’s Operational Policing Priorities link to the Commissioner’s\n \nkey objectives are shown in the table below.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPCC ObjectiveForce PriorityArea of Focus / MeasurementRet\na\ni\nn\ni\nng\n \na\nn\nd\nDe\nv\ne\nl\no\np\ni\nng\n \nNe\ni\ng\nh\nb\no\nurh\no\nod\n \nP\no\nl\ni\nc\ni\nng\n&#xa0;\nRed\nu\nc\ne\n \nNe\ni\ng\nh\nb\no\nur\nh\no\no\nd\n \nC\nri\nm\ne\n\n    \n \nA\nn\nt\ni\ns\no\nc\ni\na\nl\n \nB\ne\nh\na\nv\ni\no\nu\nr\n \n(\nA\nS\nB\n)\n \n&amp;\n \nC\nr\ni\nm\ni\nn\na\nl\nDa\nm\na\ng\ne\n\n    \n \nHouse\n \nB\nur\ng\nl\na\nr\ny\n\n    \n \nP\ner\ns\no\nn\na\nl\n \nR\no\nb\nb\ne\nr\ny\n&#xa0;\nE\nn\ns\nur\ni\nng\n \na \nB\net\nt\ner\n \nDeal\n \nf\nor\n \nV\ni\nc\nt\ni\nm\ns\n \n&amp;\n \nW\ni\ntn\ne\nss\nes\nI\nm\np\nr\no\nv\ne\n \nS\ne\nr\nv\ni\nc\nes\nt\n \no\n \nVi\nc\nt\ni\nm\ns\n \nA\nnd\n \nW\ni\ntn\ne\nss\nes\n\n    \n \nQ\nu\na\nl\ni\nt\ny\n \nO\nf\n \nS\ne\nr\nvi\nc\ne\n\n    \n \nRep\ne\nat\n \nVi\nc\nt\ni\nm\ni\ns\nat\ni\non\n&#xa0;\nP\nr\not\ne\nc\nt\ni\nng\n \nP\ne\no\np\nl\ne\n\n    \n \nS\ne\nx\nu\na\nl\n \nE\nx\np\nl\no\ni\nt\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n \no\nf C\nh\ni\nl\nd\nr\nen\n\n    \n \nHate\n \nI\nn\nc\ni\nd\ne\nn\nts\n\n    \n \nS\ne\nx\nu\na\nl\n \nO\nff\ne\nn\nd\ni\nng\n\n    \n \nDo\nm\ne\ns\nt\ni\nc\n \nA\nb\nu\ns\ne\n\n    \n \nH\ni\ngh\n \nR\ni\ns\nk\n \nM\ni\nss\ni\nng\n \nP\ne\no\np\nl\ne\nD\ni\nv\nert\ni\nn\ng\n \nP\ne\no\np\nl\ne\nf\nr\no\nm \nO\nf\nf\ne\nn\nd\ni\nn\ng\n,\n \nw\ni\nt\nh\n \na\n \nf\no\nc\nus\n \non\n \nReh\na\nb\ni\nli\nt\nat\ni\non\n \na\nn\nd\n \nthe\n \nP\nr\ne\nv\ne\nn\nt\ni\non\n \nof\nRe\n-\no\nff\ne\nn\nd\ni\nng\n&#xa0;\nRed\nu\nc\ne\n \nO\nf\nf\ne\nn\nd\ni\nng\n \nand\n P\nr\ne\nv\nent\nR\ne\n-\no\nf\nf\ne\nn\nd\ni\nng\n\n    \n \nRe\ns\ntorat\niv\ne\n \nJu\ns\nt\ni\nc\ne\n\n    \n \nIn\nt\ne\ng\nr\na\nted\n \nO\nff\ne\nn\nd\ne\nr\n \nM\na\nn\nag\ne\nm\ne\nn\nt\n\n    \n \nS\ne\nx\nu\na\nl\n \nA\nnd\n \nV\ni\no\nl\ne\nn\nt\n \nO\nff\ne\nn\nd\ners\n&#xa0;\nT\na\nc\nk\nl\ne\n \nS\neri\no\nus\n \na\nnd\n \nOr\ng\na\nn\ni\ns\ned\nC\nr\ni\nm\ne\n\n    \n \nOr\ng\na\nn\ni\ns\ne\nd\n \nC\nr\ni\nm\ne\n \nG\nr\noups\n\n    \n \nC\nr\ni\nm\ni\nn\na\nl\n \nU\ns\ne \nO\nf\n \nT\nhe\n \nR\noads\n\n    \n \nP\nr\no\nc\ne\ne\nds\n \nO\nf\n \nC\nr\ni\nm\ne\nDe\nv\ne\nl\no\np\ni\nng\n \nB\net\nt\ner\nCo\n-\nord\ni\nn\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n,\n \nCo\nm\nm\nu\nni\nc\nat\ni\non\n \na\nnd\n \nP\nart\nn\ner\ns\nh\ni\np\n \nb\ne\nt\nween\n \nAg\ne\nn\nc\ni\nes\n \nto\n \nm\na\nk\ne\n \nthe\n \nB\ne\ns\nt\n \nU\ns\ne\n \nof\n \nRe\ns\no\nu\nrc\nes\n&#xa0;\nE\nf\nf\ne\nc\nt\ni\nv\ne\n \nU\ns\ne\n \nof\n \nR\ne\ns\nou\nr\nc\nes\n&#xa0;\n\n    \n \nFor\nc\ne\n \nS\ntru\nc\nture\n\n    \n \nDe\nv\ne\nl\no\np\n \nOur\n \nL\ne\na\nd\ners\n\n    \n \nE\nff\ne\nc\nt\niv\ne\n \nP\nartner\ns\nh\ni\nps\n\n    \n \nA\nc\nt\ni\nn\ng\n \nP\nr\no\nf\ne\nss\ni\no\nn\na\nl\nl\ny\n&#xa0;\nIn developing the Police &amp; Crime Plan, the PCC takes account of public consultation, listens to partners and considers current levels of crime and disorder. It may be at times,  through circumstances beyond the Force’s control, that a target can be met very quickly. For example, in 2013-14, a three year target to surpass a baseline of funds received from the Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA) was set, based on trend analysis in this area. This target was achieved within three months due to numerous positive outcomes from high level cases. \n&#xa0;\nTargets, where there is a victim of crime, can at times be driven not only by current crime levels, but to provide opportunities where the police can improve a support service. These targets do stimulate crime reporting but can also improve the positive outcome rate. In 2013-14, Cleveland Police are targeting the reporting of serious sexual offences, domestic abuse and hate crime. \n&#xa0;\nPolice performance data is made available to the Office of the PCC for a large number of strategic policing and organisational areas. The PCC attends the Strategic Performance Group (SPG), chaired by the Deputy Chief Constable and attended by senior Police Officers and the Crime Registrar. Monthly content includes: \n&#xa0;\n\n\nYear-to-date analysis of operational policing priorities, \n\n\nCrime performance \n\n\nAntisocial behaviour data, \n\n\nPublic confidence and victim satisfaction levels, \n\n\nArrest/custody performance, and \n\n\nCrime registrar compliance. \n&#xa0;\nThe latter particularly focuses on the accuracy of National Crime Recording System (NCRS) information, with ‘voided crime’, ‘no crime’, ‘crimes failing the 72 hour rule’ and ‘conversion of incidents to crime’ all monitored with performance within set tolerances reported and assessed. The Crime Registrar also undertakes monthly thematic audits of the National Standard for Incident Recording (NSIR) counting rules, reporting all findings to the SPG. Any resulting corrective action is embedded in Control Room processes to ensure compliance and resilience. \n&#xa0;\nIn December 2013, Cleveland was subject to an HMIC crime data integrity ‘fact finding’ visit which fulfils stage 1 of a national crime data integrity inspection. Independent inspectors from HMIC, working on behalf of the Home Office, assessed the integrity of policing processes and practices and the management, reporting, recording and investigation of crime. Initial feedback indicates that Cleveland has robust and appropriate systems for ensuring integrity and transparency in crime management. A full inspection is due next year. \n&#xa0;\nPCC Performance Scrutiny \n&#xa0;\nThe Office of the PCC also conducts its own scrutiny of crime performance via a dedicated Performance Team, who assesses all data provided by the Force. They liaise with the \nForce Executive and their Performance Team on a regular basis to ensure I am briefed of any particular performance issues or evolving trends. \n&#xa0;\nAs PCC, I meet with the Chief Constable on a weekly basis to consider current and future issues, including performance management, via a structured agenda.\n&#xa0;\nOn a quarterly basis, I conduct Performance Scrutiny Meetings, where the Deputy Chief Constable answers posed questions on quarterly performance issues. Performance Exception Reports are presented, where the Force’s priorities are examined to assess if annual targets are and will be met, with any good performance highlighted and areas for improvement challenged. Since September 2013, I have been publishing these Exception Reports monthly on my website, to further inform the public and provide an extra layer of transparency in local crime performance. \n&#xa0;\nConclusion \n&#xa0;\nThe PCC, Home Office and more importantly, the public, must have complete faith that crime figures and data reported by the police is as accurate as possible and genuinely reflects the climate of crime today. \n&#xa0;\nI can conclude that through my regular involvement in both the monitoring and challenging of the crime figures, I have confidence in the accuracy and integrity of the Cleveland Police crime recording processes and that information is reported, processed, managed, and challenged appropriately. This is further satisfied by the integrity and transparency in crime management being highlighted by HMIC in their recent fact finding visit.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n"
