defaultIntroducing the Women’s Engineering Society
default&#xa0;defaultThe Women’s Eng
defaultineering Society is a volunteer-le
defaultd, small charity in existence for over 90 years. Our members represent all sectors, are qualified in subjects from maths, 
defaultchemistry and biosciences through to PhD rocket scientists and all manner of engineering disciplines. They have entered technical professions through a variety of routes: engineering or science degrees, apprenticeships and even arts/humanities backgrounds.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Women’s Engineering Society was founded in 1919 and has a history of working closely with government on issues relating to women and work with particular relevance to science, technology and engineering. The Society draws its members from a broad ran
defaultge of sectors including defence, manufacturing, sciences, banking and finance and all stages of education
default,
default and policy making. Members also reflect all career and life stages.
default&#xa0;
defaultOur submission 
defaultincludes

defaultFactual information of which we would like the com
defaultmittee to be aware 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe issue of women engineers and scientists goes 
defaultback to
default WW1 as seen in historical record of the Women’s Engineering Society (WES). Since the early years there have been almost annual enquiries into aspects of this issue for many years
default and ‘wake-up calls’ followed by short term projects every decade since the 1970s
default and even before
default. The progress has been modest, at best, and short term at worst. There is too much fragmentation of effort and re-invention of wheels. There is a need for act
defaultion rather than examining, over and over again, why the situation exists. In the meantime, expensively-educated women are ‘lost’ to STEM careers in droves, for reasons not of their choosing. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTable 1 lists some of the many projects undertaken to help prog
defaultress women in their chosen careers as a timeline. 
defaultNote that this list represents just the last 30 years and there were numerous schemes and projects from about 1970 onwards, and even many efforts both during and 
defaultbetween
default the two world wars.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default“There have 
defaultbeen many laudable schemes that have attempted to stem this loss of talent, but which, because of their often ad hoc, partial and short-term nature, have failed to have a sustained impact.”

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;
defaultAll of the 
defaultrecommendations
default apply equally to women in industry, not least because we believe the nation would benefit if it was easy to move backwards and forwards between academia and industry during 
defaulta
default ca
defaultreer.
default These measures should be coordin
defaultated by a body at the heart of the STEM academic/policy or funding community.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhy do numbers of women i
defaultn STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder?
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe “Leaky Pipeline”. 
defaultIt has been understood for decades that, even when the proportion of students of STEM subjects who are women is similar to or higher than that of men, by the time academic careers are reaching the possibility of a first tenured lectureship, the percentage 
defaultof women has already started to decline and by the time of the professorship stage, women are typically about 15% of the total, at best. Female undergraduates and even postgraduate students commonly deny this will happen to them and are stunned and aghast 
defaultwhen it does. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default1
defaultStatistics on this “Leaky pipeline” pattern are frequently presented in one of two forms: “The impossible pursuit graph”, in which the two lines (male and female %) never cross due to the lower % of women entering first degrees in that 
defaultsubject; and “The scissor diagram”, in which the lines cross, usually in the PhD/Postdoc stage, due to significant drop-out at some point after the first degree.
default&#xa0;
default2
default“It is no secret that many women join WES after a few years in the workplace, whether in i
defaultndustry, education or academia, when they feel they can no longer ignore the evidence piling up that all is not quite right, that the playing field is not quite level.”
default&#xa0;
default3
defaultThe “Two-body” problem. 
default&#xa0;
defaultRelationships can ‘fix’ one partner in a place where the 
defaultother partner cannot find appropriate work. In a heterosexual relationship it is commonplace for the man to be a few years older than the woman and hence likely to be in a more advanced and secure employment, which makes any decision to uproot, in order fo
defaultr the woman to take appropriate work, even harder.  How many new PhD women move out of STEM due to this? As there is a continuing, possibly even worse, culture of fixed term employment contracts in both the teaching-only and research areas of Higher educat
defaultion, the legislation seems to work against early career STEM workers gaining ‘tenure’.
default&#xa0;
default4
default“
defaultFor me the real difficulty was moving from fixed term post-doc positions to a permanent contract.
default&#xa0;
default The fixed term employee regulations 2002 made it difficult to kee
defaultp employment in the same geographical area (causing difficulty of maintaining two careers),”
default&#xa0;
default5
defaultChild bearing and child/elder caring. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAre Principal Investigators in charge of appointing early career researchers still recruiting men to avoid maternity le
defaultave costs or ‘inconveniences’ during their projects? Women still report being asked (illegal) questions about their ‘family plans’ at interview. Could all UK Research Council funding streams guarantee additional funding on demand for parental leave cover f
defaultor both male and female staff?
default&#xa0;
default6
defaultHowever, it seems widely unknown that actually parental leave 
defaultsaves
default the university money, even though the university tops up the income above SMP. If this saving can be tracked, the head of department should be able to say to their faculty “XX is off on leave, saving the university £YY. The dept would like to use this to 
defaulthire a post-doc to cover XX’s lectures, and/or an administrative staff member to administrate XX’s exams and marking etc.”
default&#xa0;
default7
default“I hope that things have changed, but I'm not convinced that some STEM departments are yet gender neutral in recruitment, or in t
defaulthe attitude of some older staff to female academics who strive for promotion.
default&#xa0;
default Most of this bias is unconscious, but it can make for an uncomfortable working environment.”
default&#xa0;
default8
default“
defaultCovering family responsibilities for absences at scientific conferences and mee
defaulttings can be tricky, 
defaultand this constrains networking opportunities.
default&#xa0;
default There is some funding available to cover costs, but the cover still has to be found. It can be difficult to balance the time required to establish and maintain an academic career with the 
defaultneeds of a family (this is a cultural issue).”
default&#xa0;
default9
default“I have been completely screwed by an institution where no female Engineering Academic has ever had a (paid) sabbatical, grants &amp; PhD students are taken away by others/terminated due to maternity leave 
default‘absence’.”
default&#xa0;
default10
defaultThere is a lack of affordable child care which fits the demands of a full time academic career.  It is often not clearly understood by new parents that preschool child care is much easier to arrange, assuming it is available and affordable
default at all in their area, than childcare for primary schoolchildren. Childcare in the UK is considered to be amongst the most expensive in the world. An added expense is that it is paid for out of post-tax income, also it is anticipated that all parents emplo
defaultying childcare in their own homes (nannies) will soon have to pay for the nannies’ pensions too.
default&#xa0;
default11
defaultBefore-and-after school or all-day holiday childcare or ‘clubs’ for 5-14 year olds are not available everywhere, even in the big cities. This can further 
defaultconstrain women’s options as academics. Childcare difficulties for school age children can lead to parents using all their annual leave allowance to cover childcare between them and both parents getting no holiday break at all. How many women academics fai
defaultl to thrive in their posts due to these difficulties? 
default&#xa0;
default12
default“I worked in an engineering department which was a thoroughly unpleasant workplace, where bullying was rife, with a sexist head who called me "girl" and told me "don't worry your head about it, gi
defaultrl" and with colleagues who made it clear that I should be at home with my kid and they weren't interested in collaborating with me “because I was a mother and therefore couldn't travel”.”
default&#xa0;
default13
default“One of the biggest factors for many women in deciding whether
default to remain in or return to a STEM career is the provision of good quality, affordable childcare. In many places, suitable childcare is not available near the place of work and does not match the hours that the parents work.  Where such facilities exist, th
defaulte places are often over-subscribed and prohibitively expensive.” [Tapping all our Talents - Women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics: a strategy for Scotland. 2012]
default&#xa0;
default14
defaultChildcare for single parents in order to attend the international con
defaultferences which are essential to career progression, can be impossible if there is no nearby family to take over. There is no such thing as residential childcare in this country, the nearest thing being perhaps the residential ‘summer camps’ run by the comm
defaultercial sector in some parts of the country for older children.
default&#xa0;
default15
defaultLong-hours expectation. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe standard 37-hour week academic contract is almost universally translated by university management into a reality of 60-hour working weeks for many if not most
default academic staff. This is highly anti-family but is required in order to prepare for the teaching load and also achieve the grant applications and research outputs required by all university hierarchies. How many women find that the aggregate of duties - ch
defaultild care, elder care, housework, lecture preparation, research work - all pile up until something has to yield?
default&#xa0;
default16
default“Head of Department came into my office privately and told me I was a fool to get pregnant and that I would as a consequence never get a pe
defaultrmanent post now. His view was that nobody would appoint me with a small baby as I would not be able to put in enough hours to compete with the rest.”
default&#xa0;
default17
default“I was told by the head of department that I could not put my three periods of maternity leave onto 
defaultmy promotion application and CV – he would not support it if I did. It was his opinion that the panel would not support my application if they thought I had small children as I couldn't put the required hours in. In the end I was turned down for internal p
defaultromotion because there were 'gaps' in my publication record (which corresponded to my periods of leave …). At this point I got a Senior Lectureship elsewhere and left!”
default&#xa0;
default18
defaultThe pressure to achieve specified outcomes, especially in connection with the gove
defaultrnment’s assessment schemes (RAE08, REF14 etc), can lead to women in particular being accused of failure to produce the outcomes, whilst still overloading them with far more teaching, administrative and pastoral obligations than their apparently more succe
defaultssful male colleagues. This demonstrably leads to health issues, if nothing else, and still does not achieve the best research for the university.
default&#xa0;
default19
defaultIn addition, this is both exploitative of the staff member and deprives someone else of the opportunity 
defaultto work in academia, since the overworked academic is doing the equivalent of nearly two jobs for the price of one. Thus, thousands of jobs which should be filled by other people, are ‘hidden’ behind the facade of the long hours culture, due to one person 
defaultdoing 60 hours on a 37 hour contract.
default&#xa0;
default20
defaultLack of career path. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMany early career men and women find themselves trapped in multiple fixed term contracts, with a lack of job security. There is no direct route from fixed term research assistant posts to 
defaulttenure-track posts. More women than men are to be found in low status and short term contracts.
default 
defaultThere are still many hidden rules, and male-dominated committees.
default&#xa0;
default21
default“Mentoring has been incredibly useful for me in my career - I would have given up and got
default a teaching job except for my mentor.”
default&#xa0;
default2
default2
defaultAcademe is shrinking numerically due to cuts, and the numbers of academics retiring is reducing due to the changes in pension ages, so there is not much movement further up the academic ladder and so no promotion
default within the same institution may be likely or possible. Family ties may restrict ability to choose to apply for promotion jobs elsewhere. Unless ring-fenced funding is made available to create senior posts associated with career progression for women, the 
defaultcurrent (small) cohort of early and mid career women have no prospect of promotion.
default&#xa0;
default2
default3
defaultLack of visibility and role models at all levels in the university. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSome departments have never had female academics. Most universities have no buildings or even 
defaultrooms named after significant women. Most universities have few or no portraits of women on the walls.
default&#xa0;
default2
default4
default“It is discouraging to [me as a postgrad] see so few women in permanent positions and managerial positions. This applies not just to engineering but
default to the University as a whole, for example the management team have only 25% women and the University Court is similar % female.”
default&#xa0;
default2
default5
default“It is key that young academics (PhDs, post-docs, Early Career Researchers) are able to see that it is possible to be a s
defaultuccessful female in their field. I have been lucky to have some amazingly supportive senior female colleagues, and consider it part of my duties to mentor younger academics of both genders, but particularly to support female scientists and engineers.  If t
defaulthe university wanted to be seen to take this seriously, there should be credit given in promotion cases for time spent on mentoring at all levels from primary school, to one-on-one mentoring with someone going on mat leave, for instance.”
default&#xa0;
default2
default6
defaultThe HE secto
defaultr should be offered a special “Two Cultures into One” grant scheme to enable institutions to commission artists to produce portraits of female STEM achievers for display throughout their buildings.
default&#xa0;
default2
default7
defaultWhen women leave academia, what careers do they 
defaulttransition into? What are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in different employment sectors?
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultThis question might usefully be expanded to include women who move sideways within academia, either into the managerial/adm
defaultinistrative grades, or into other disciplines, such as education or 
defaulthumanities. Arguably, their STEM skills continue to be of use but they are no longer working so directly with their original degree topics.
default&#xa0;
default2
default8
default“I am moving to a humanities department as 
defaultI am more interested in the social, economic, political and legal barriers to the uptake of engineering/science. Engineering [in my previous department] was just about the numbers/technology, it didn't consider if that information was of use to anyone.”
default&#xa0;
default2
default9
defaultInterestingly, only a vanishingly tiny proportion of elected politicians at any level have a STEM background and most of those are from medical careers. Hardly any decision-makers have any personal insight into either the culture or the expertise in STE
defaultM. This is frequently reflected in the low proportion of STEM people (of any gender) featuring in the Honours Lists, or in Top100 (men/women/most powerful/richest etc) lists in the media. A recent list in The Guardian of the top 100 most powerful LGBT peop
defaultle did not feature a single person with a STEM career. STEM is less visible to the media than the many excellent science programmes on the TV might suggest.
default&#xa0;
default30
defaultWhat should universities and the higher education sector do to retain women graduates and PhD 
defaultstudents in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice?
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultUniversities should have to provide paid research sabbatical on return from maternity (or paternity/ adoption/ long-term sick) leave, so that staff do 6 months of only research (no teaching), to get themselves back on track. This should NOT be to the detri
defaultment of other staff so it needs to be funded. 
default&#xa0;
default3
default1
default“I arranged a 6 months funding for xxxx to take a break from teaching on return from her maternity leave in April 2013. I wrote her salary into a bid from EPSRC and the faculty agreed to transfer the full
default sum back to the department to cover her.”
default&#xa0;
default3
default2
defaultThere should be a presumption of agreement to, or even an encouragement of flexible working, both in time and location but not to encourage a long hours' culture whether at home or in the office. Senior women
default in STEM in industry report being able to take “Annualised hours” or compressed weeks/months.
default&#xa0;
default3
default3
defaultClear work load models which make it possible to achieve the targets, without excessive unpaid overtime. There should be an obligation to publish the workloa
defaultd models and audit them to ensure compliance.
default&#xa0;
default3
default4
defaultCompulsory training for 
defaultall
default people who wish to be Principal Investigators or on appointment or promotion panels, involving interviews with people who had some real life issues. The research councils could lead the way by requiring evidence of such training for anyone who wants to be
default a PI applicant to any of their schemes.
default&#xa0;
default3
default5
defaultEncourage those on maternity leave to come into the department for regular meetings with PhD students and RAs etc in their group, and add that time to the total maternity leave period or deduct from full time 
defaulthours on return.
default&#xa0;
default3
default6
defaultResources saved due to parental/sickness leave should be automatically redirected to the cost centre in which they are needed for to pay for cover for teaching etc. The savings to the department for someone earning about £30k gross pe
defaultr year would be at least £11k.
default&#xa0;
default3
default7
defaultVisibility: those universities which have publicly displayed portraits of, for instance, past chair-holders and principals, will normally have an almost exclusively male display. This should be counteracted by commission
defaulting portraits for public areas of women of achievement from amongst staff and alumnae and perhaps also from the wider STEM field. Name buildings and rooms after similar women.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;

default8
defaultWhat role should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers? 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultSchemes to encourage girls and women into STEM degrees and careers have been going on for a long time now and have not shifted the statistics much (see
default table 1); in the last 20 years the proportion of working engineers who are women has gone up from 6% to 8% - not a good return on all the effort. Something else is needed and WES believes it lies in workplace culture or “climate”. Measures that are long-t
defaulterm, 
defaultnot adhoc
