defaultChannel 4 welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee’s inquiry into women’s sport.
defaultWe note, in particular, that the Committee has decided to focus in part on the media coverage of women’s sports. As a 
defaultUK public service
default broadcaster
default that televises a select number of sporting events
default, Channel 4 is committed to providing coverage of women in 
defaultsport, and our response below is confined specificall
defaulty to this aspect of the inquiry, rather than the broader topic of women’s sport.
defaultChannel 4’s coverage of sports has, over the years, tended to 
defaultfocus on one or two major sporting commitments, for example 
defaultcricket from 1999 to 2005 and, latterly, through our coverage of 
defaultdisability
default sport and horseracing
default. In 2013, Channel 4 took over 
defaultlive coverage of all the major horseracing meetings 
defaultin the UK
default.
defaultThese events are both notable for involving sports in which women
default compete on an equal footing, either alongside men’s events (such as women’s athletics) or as competitors with men (for example, the Paralympic sport Boccia and in horseracing where there are an increasing number of female jockeys).
default As such, while Channel 
default4 does not provide as extensive levels of sports coverage as other broadcasters, our coverage of a select number of sports makes a significant contribution to the coverage of female competitors as well as men.
defaultThe following submission 
defaultsets out Channel 4’s 
defaultapproach to coverage in this area, looking at our current range of sports programming and our plans for broadcas
defaultting these sports in the future, which we hope the Committee will find useful as part of their wider inquiry into women’s sport.

defaultmore about the state of play of women’s sport in the UK
default, commissioning a private
default external research project
default 
defaulton this issue for internal information purposes.
defaultWhile recognising that there are reasons to be 
defaultoptimistic about women’s sport – such as the
default impressive
default peak audiences for women’s events at the Olympics and Paralympics and the increasing levels of sponsorship of female athletes at London 2012 – this research found that there are a number of wider deve
defaultlopmental challenges that need to be tackled.
defaultFor example
default, while broadcast coverage may be a necessary condition for popularising women’s sport, it found that is not an exclusive one: many other factors are required to work as part of a virtuous cycle, as 
defaultoutlined in the graphic below:
