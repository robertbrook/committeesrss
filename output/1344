defaultWritten edefaultvidence from the defaultCentre for Mental HealthdefaultIntroductiondefaultCentre for Mental Health is an independent charity working to improve the life chances of people facing or living with mental ill health. We have 
defaultcarried out extensive work on mental health and criminal justice, including examining the support offered to offenders and ways of preventing offending by promoting better mental health and life chances early in life. Our evidence is drawn from that work a
defaultnd demonstrates the importance of investing in mental health promotion and support to reduce offending and reoffending.
defaultOur evidence looks at three areas in which a better response to mental health at different stages of life and 
defaultcontact with 
defaultthe criminal 
defaultjustice system could help to reduce crime and improve community safety. It builds on evidence provided to the previous Justice Select Committee’s inquiry into Justice Reinvestment
default.
defaultMental health treatment requirementdefaultIn 2005
default, the
default Ment
defaultal Health Treatment Re
defaultquirement
default (MHTR) 
defaultwas introduced as one of 12 options for a community sentence in England and Wales
default. 
defaultThe 
defaultMHTR provide
defaults
default sentencers with an option  to deal with the situation where individuals 
defaulthave committed offences that do not require a prison sentence but 
defaultwho need mental health treatment as part of their rehabilitation
default.
default 
defaultRecent research has found that the MHTR offers stability in the lives of people who receive them as part of a community sentence (Scott and Moffatt, 2012).
defaultA
defaultt least 39% of offenders supervis
defaulted by probation services have mental health problems (Brooker et al., 2012)
default.
default By contrast just 1% of community sentences include an MHTR. 
defaultWe believe that the MHTR has unfulfilled potential to enable more people to be diverted from short prison sentences. It can be used on its own or in combination with other requirements. 
defaultRecently introduced flexibilities in the operation of the MHTR, for ex
defaultample in the production of court psychiatric reports, should help to increase uptake but knowledge and confidence about MHTR is low among sentencers, probation services and health and social care.
default Further guidance and support from the Ministry of Justice a
defaultnd Department of Health could help to encourage greater and more effective use of the MHTR.
defaultLiaison and diversiondefaultMental health diversion schemes operate at the interface between criminal justice and mental health. They seek to ensure that people with ment
defaultal health problems who come into contact 
defaultwith the police and courts are identified and directed towards appropriate mental health care, particularly as an alternative to imprisonment. 
defaultThe
default Centre collected evidence that show
defaulted
default well-designed arrangements for
default diversion have the potential to yield multiple benefits, including:
defaultThe Government has committed to
default 
defaultexpanding availability of liaison and diversion services to police stations and courts across England, subject to business case approval.
default This is a welcome development. It is vital that this is completed successfully and sustainably to screen offenders fo
defaultr mental health needs and offer advice and support to criminal justice agencies.
default It is also crucial that liaison and diversion services provide tailored support to children and young people as well as adults as well as gender-specific responses to female o
defaultffenders and appropriate support for people from Black and minority ethnic communities.
defaultPrevention and early defaultinterventiondefaultAbout five per cent of children in England have severe and persistent behavioural problems, while a further 15% have less serious but 
defaultstill marked behavioural difficulties. These children go on to commit 80% of all crime over their lifetimes. People who had the most serious behavioural problems from a young age are 20 times more likely than their peers
default 
defaultto end up in prison by their mid-tw
defaultenties. 
defaultSevere behavioural problems have many causes but in many cases they can be prevented or managed by positive parenting (Centre for Mental Health, 2009b).
defaultParenting
default programmes 
defaultthat strengthen families
default and help parents
default to manage children’s behaviour 
defaultc
defaultan reduce 
defaultthe risk of a child getting involved in offending later in life
default. 
defaultThey also improve the 
defaultmental 
defaulthealth of parents and children alike.
defaultThe total cost of crime attributable to people who had conduct problems in childhood is estimated at about £60 bil
defaultlion a year in England and Wales, equivalent to about £225,000 per person (Centre for Mental Health, 2009b). 
defaultEvidence-based parenting programmes, by contrast, cost about £1,200 per child.
default 
defaultTargeted provision of effective parenting programmes 
defaultthus 
defaultrepresent
defaults excellent value for public money. At present, however, it remains patchy and in many areas inadequate to meet the needs of the local population.
default 
defaultThe Centre recently examined ways in which the provision of effective parenting programmes could be improved.
default These include:
defaultFurther research from the Centre has found that young women involved in gang activity had very high rates of early starting behavioural problems
default as well as multiple vulnerabilities from a young age, including neglect and maltreatment (Khan et al, 2013). This research concluded that all services working with families and children (including adult mental health services, prisons and substance misuse
default services) need to be alert to the risk factors for gang involvement among girls and young women in order to prevent risks accumulating.
