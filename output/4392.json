"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence from Cambridgeshire County Council (LTD0011)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;1.1 \nThe basis for devolving funds and powers to local areas is to pass greater control \nover setting the vision \nand delivering growth \nand ensuring\n that businesses are involved in driving the economic prosperity o\nf their areas. \nThis \ni\ns based on \nLord \nHeseltine's recommendations in his report ' \nNo Stone unturned'\n which called for the creation of a single cash pot, which could be worth up to £49bn, bringing together dispara\nte funding streams from across G\novernment wit\nhout ring fences. However the reality is that funding levels are expected to be closer to £2bn per annum. Most of this is \nunderstood to be \nrecycled funding for \nL\nocal \nA\nuthorities from transport, housing and skills budgets, including some 55% funding from Df\nt. However this funding is to be \nunringfenced\n for LEP’s to bid \nfor \non a competitive basis for a Growth Deal to help secure a share towards driving economic growth in their areas. \n&#xa0;\n1.2 \nThe rational is fully appreciated in that there needs to be greater \ninvolvement of businesses in setting the vision and helping achi\neve economic prosperity for local\n areas. However there needs to be a balanced approach \nincluding democratically elected Members as key decision makers \nto \ntackling\n the \nkey challenges and ensuri\nng that the \nright conditions for growth \nar\ne achieved and sustained into the future. \n&#xa0;\n1.3 \nThe main advantage\ns\n of devolving funding \nare\n that \nit is \nunringfenced\n and provides \ngreater certainty over levels of funding anticipated over a longer period from 2015 -202\n1 (if the allocations announced in the summer of 2014 cover that period rather than simply 2015/16 levels only). \nThi\ns offers greater potential than cyclical funding bid rounds which are generally \nfor specific Departmental deliverables over a very short per\niod and require a detailed business case \nup front – such as Pinch points/\n Growing Places. \n&#xa0;\n1.4 \nThis should help areas with developing a more holistic \nprogramme\n and pipeline of projects focused on delivering economic benefits. The advantage being that there is \nbett\ner potential to deal with the myriad of complex issues and challenges that need to be a\nddressed to create and maintain the right conditions for growth. \n&#xa0;\n1.5 \nOn disadvantages, much of the funding has \nbeen top sliced from \nAuthorities \nbudgets\n, and not all is \nunringfenced\n. \nAlso LEP’s will be\n \nthe key decision makers regarding the priorities for fund\ning for their areas\n, and \nAuthorities will \nnow \nneed to be able to convince LEP’s regarding priorities. \nTherefore i\nn many ways the decision maki\nng powers appear to be \nremoved f\nr\no\nm the democratically elected local \nM\nembers. There is a greater \nfocus on ‘busines\ns’ leading on \nthe priorities for their areas.\n While\n \nb\nusiness involvement is critical in helping to inspire and innovate and \ninform\n the ambitions for local areas\n, this should be\n as part \nof an overall balanced approach led by \ndemocratically elected Members \nwith ultimate responsibility for achieving the agreed outcomes for their communities.\n&#xa0;\n1.6 \nThere is also a risk \nthat money will be spent on \nbidding processes and \nsp\necific support \niniatives\n for a short period without \nnecessarily addressing the \nunderlying challe\nnges and improving the conditions for businesses to grow and thrive\n into the future\n.  \n&#xa0;\n1.7 \nThe \nmodel could be improved \nif Governmen\nt made the funding available to ‘\nLEP area\n’s’\n, \nrather than a specific body \nwith local areas \ndeciding \nwhich \norgansiation\n was best \nplaced to \nlead and \nmanage the funds\n as ‘Accountable Authority\n’\n, much as the LTB arrangement works\n. There are options \nfor different arrangements \nwhich \ncould include County/ Upper Tier Boards, \nLEP, \nEconomic Prosperity Boards, Joint Strategic Committees or \nalternatives. The key issue is th\nat local areas should ideally decide and deals should be based on \noutcomes \nto be delivered \nand funding devolved on that basis. \nGovernment would still set clear criteria and conditions for allocation of funds in LEP areas su\nch as requiring a strong evidence base, or operating across the LEP area or having private sector involvement\n&#xa0;\n1.8 \nIt will be important to enhance t\nhe role of \nlocal Leaders/\n democratically elected members \nwho \nare \nthe \nkey decision makers mandated to deliver \nfor\n their communities.\n \nMost of the duty lies with the local authorities given their statutory functions around \ntransport and \nplanning for growth and prosperity, and \nthey \nare re\nsponsible for delivering on these \nambitions\n.  \n&#xa0;\n1.9 \nD\nevolving funding over at least a 10 year period \nthrough an agreed model \nto deliver agreed outcomes that best fit\n local \ncircumstances\n \nwould enable loca\nl areas to take \ngreater control and \niniative\n. \nThis would \nen\nsure\n a more holistic \napproach\n \nto address some o\nf the complexities necessary to achieve step change \nor structural\n change needed in some areas\n,\n \nto drive forward economic growth and achieve longer term aims rather than a focus on immediate deliverables or targets. \n&#xa0;\n1.10&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe City Deal model is a good example \nwhere in \nCambridge\nshire\n we are \n   \nseeking to agree a Gain S\nhare mechanism to help deliver c\n£\n500m of transport infrastructure investment to support growth and development. Through this mechanism local \npartner\ns\n \nwill\n work together through a combined authority\n and invest up front in infrastructure to encourage \nbusiness growth\n. The are\na\n is to \nretain a share of the uplift in taxes over base to cover costs of additional investment. This type of model will enable the Leaders working with the LEP and key partners to\n invest up front in infrastructure and greatly improve conditions for businesses. Such ambitious plans a\nnd clarity of investment focus is\n vital for businesses to see when they\n are deciding where in the worl\nd to l\nocate or grow. \n&#xa0;\n              \n&#xa0;\n2.1 \nThere is a real lack of resources to assess, \nprioritise\n and deliver local transport sche\nmes across all levels currently.\n&#xa0;\n2.2 \nLEP’s have been set up with minimal resources and are intended to be lean bodies with a focus on achieving through thei\nr partners. However this means that the Authorities \ndeliver many of the aims and \nprovide revenue support for basic operation of the LEP. The \nlack of capacity and resources \nmeans in some case LEP’s are spread t\nhin and don’t have the resource\n or expertise to support on transport schemes. Indeed this is the role for the Local Transport Authorities to assess, \nprioritise\n and deliver local transport schemes. However the difficulty is that Authorities budgets have been reduced significantly from 20\n08 levels, where both integrated transport and maintenance budgets were reduced by almost 45%. \n&#xa0;\n2.3 \nReduced budgets, particularly on the revenue side coupled with a lack of available resource funding from Government, (apart from specific \nprogrammes\n like LSTF \naimed at behavioral changes which has been useful) there have not been resources to undertake early options appraisal \nor \nscheme development work. Therefore in most cases, Local Authorities \ndon’t have a pipeline of projects and focus only on key projects th\ney can commit to in terms of resources \nto progress critical schemes to support growth. M\nost m\najor projects and schemes require significant \nup front\n investment and ofte\nn over a lengthy period of time\n.\n \nExamples for this area include Cambridge Science Park St\nation, which has been in the LTP for \nyears\n, and while there was understood to be a good business case, there was never sufficient major schemes funding to progress \nthe case \nto delivery. Through strong local leadership and a willingness to take the risk, \nCa\nmbridgeshire\n County Council \nis progressing the case to \napproval for \nde\nlivery. However developing the c\nase and designing to a detailed stage has taken some 3 years and cost \nmillions\n to take it to planning \napproval \nstage for Network Rail to take forward to d\nelivery stage. \n&#xa0;\n2.4 \nMost of the current \nGovernment funding tends only to be available when schemes are at an advanced stage and for the most part have all their approvals in place. This means that schemes are unlikely to come forward unless the Local Authorit\nies’ have committed to progressing them. There is little funding available to test options or look for more innovative solutions, \ntherefore \nLocal Authorities \nhave to invest significant \nin terms of \noption appraisal /\nscheme development with little resources,\n partic\nularly at the early stages. The LGF offers potential in terms of \nnow building up a \nprogramme\n \nand pipeline \nfor delivery \nover time to hopefully address priorities\n.\n That is provided there is agreement locally with LEP’s on priorities and funding.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1 \nWhile a focus on the functional economic area is important, \nit\n would be helpful to have a more comprehensive vision and appro\nach across a wider area\n. This would \nhelp ensure join up on approach and priorities around improving access to markets, and fostering relationships between related industries and spreading the benefits of growth\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.2 \nIdeally there needs to be a wider overview \nto ensure clarity and consistency across LEP’s and LTB areas regarding the challenges and priorities. There is a risk that at the moment, particularly for the key corridors that there could be a lack of join up and investment to support addressing key aims\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.3 \nSome good work was done in the past on Regional Transport Plan, and this type of overview would be particularly helpful if linked to an investment plan and join up on priorities for investment \nincluding \nkey \npartners \nlike \nDft\n, Highways Agency and Network\n Rail. This could also then ensure join up on cross boundary priorities for LTB’s and LEP’s. This would be particularly helpful for transport issues which are not related to specific geographies and with a greater focus on corridors and improving links and\n accessibility to and between key destinations to support more efficient movement of people and goods’ \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1 \nThere is a good working relationship at the local level between the Authorities across \nCambridgeshire\n and \nPeterborough\n where the authorities are working closely under the Duty to cooperate particularly on planning and transport matters.\n  As part of this wo\nrk the authorities have agr\need their objectively assessed\n housing needs across the whole area and Members have worked together to develop a \nDraft \nLong Term Transport Strategy to identify the key measures and interventions needed to support growth and conti\nnued economic prosperity looking forward. \n4.2 \nThe Greater Cambridge Greater Peterborough \nShadow \nLocal Transport Body has proven to be an effective and efficient body where the LEP and the Upper tier authorities have worked successfully to develop a robust and\n deliverable major schemes programme within a challenging timescale. The Body was set up to secure devolved major schemes funding in response to \nDft’s\n request and systems were put in place to comply with requirements. Despite being awarded 33% less funding\n than anticipated, the LTB agreed 6 priority schemes within a challenging timescale.  \n&#xa0;\n4.3 \nFurther to this, t\nhe LEP has \nnow \ntasked the LTB with developing a \nprogramme\n of transport schemes to recommend to the LEP for inclusion in \ntheir Strategic Economic Plan \nto drive economic growth. This process is working well despite the challenging timescales. However there is some concern that while the LTB is developing a robust and deliverable \nprogramme\n aimed at supporting and facilitating growth, it is up to the LEP to\n decide on priorities and funding, and the duty will still fall to the Authorities to deliver on most of the \nambitions\n although they may not have the resources to do so.  \n&#xa0;\n4.4 \nLooking forward\n, it is proposed to review \nthe terms of reference \nand remit \nfor the LTB to align with the LEP and \nwider role and geography.\n4.5 \nO\nur LEP has been greatly supportive of transport as a key priority for this area and recognizes the key role this plays in everyday lives and as a key enabler of growth. Indeed our LEP is alre\nady providing some £50m towards supporting the delivery of the A14 improvement scheme and has agreed the \nDf\nT\n funding previously committed to major schemes which is welcome. However there is a risk that the LEP will decide that \nthey\n need to \nprioritise\n other\n area\ns\n \nnow\n, without necessarily understanding that authorities won’t have resources without the LGF to progress key schemes that support and unlock growth.\n&#xa0;\n4.6 \nThere is a good local working relationship between the LEP, LTB and HA, and Dft. However there is a\n lack of clarity regarding future expectations in relation to LGF, in terms of the \nfuture \nrole and remit of the LTB, working cross boundaries and assessment criteria for LGF. More join up in terms of clarity on expectations for key Departments would be hel\npful \nto ensure consistency and c\nertaint\ny regarding the\n arrangements.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n5.1 \nThe funding environment is challenging particularly \ngiven \nthat l\nevels of Integrated Block and Maintenance Block funding have been reduced by some 45% already from 2008 levels. There is uncertainty over what the \nproposed \ntop slice of funding for the \nIntegra\nted B\nlock into the Single Local Growth\n Fund pot will mean for future t\nransport funding from 2015 onwards. In addition, \nDft\n has made it clear that there is unlikely to be any additional funding for \nlocal \ntransport beyond the formula grant and LGF funding. \n5.2 \nLEP \nrepresentatives have\n \nworked closely with the LTB to agree\n \nthe current priority \nmajor schemes \nand \nfunding \nallocations and this commitment has been agreed. However the reality is that \ncurrent funding levels for major schemes are not sufficient to help de\nliver on the priority schemes and although we are hopeful, there is a lack of clarity that \nthe levels of funding necessary \nwill be secured through the Growth Deal\n.\n5.3 \nLTB’s were set up to secure devolved major schemes funding\n from \nDfT\n.\n A\nlthough \nDft\n confirmed there \nis a significant increase in major schemes funding, \nsome \n33% less \nmajor schemes \nfunding \nwas committed \nto the \ncurrent priority schemes than the indicative amounts set out \nearlier.\n  This was \nmost\n disappointing and for our area, as the Aut\nhorities are keen to make progress on the priority schemes\n to support continued growth\n, the authorities agreed to deliver 6 \npriority \nschemes. \nHowever in order to \ndeliver theses, some 80% of the funding is being sourced\n f\nr\no\nm the local authorities, \nmostly\n th\nrough prudential borrowing. In addition there was little or no money available for scheme development or business case development so local partners have had to take on thos\ne costs. In ou\nr case, the LEP has been most supportive and stepped in to cover the \ncosts of independent scrutiny of schemes\n which was an additional \nDft\n requirement.\n \n5.4 \nWhile a major uplift in major schemes funding \nis most welcome \nfrom \nDft\n, it isn’t clear that this funding will be available to support the delivery of major schemes as all of\n this funding is now going into the LGF. The difficulty is that the LGF is \nunringfenced\n and can be spent on LEP priorities towards delivering economic benefits which can vary enormously in terms of outputs. There is also no guarantee that the LEP will see \ntransport as their top priority and therefore no certainty that the funding will support priority transport projects. \n5.5 \nIn addition, LEP’s will be making decision\ns\n on priorities for the funding without necessarily understanding the local government funding \ncontext. There may be an assumption that \nAuthorities\n will carry on with \n‘\nbusiness as usual\n’ and fund\n schemes. However the reality \nis\n that basic\n budgets have been reduced and unless \nAuthoritie\ns\n can access this LGF funding to help deliver priorities, the pro\ngrammes \ncould well\n need to be reduced\n to match the reality of reduced funding\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;6.1 \nDevolving funding to local areas from \n2015 to 2021 is welcome\n. H\nowever \nas the\n funding is going \nthough\n the LEP, \nt\nh\nis\n means that Authorities and other partners need to go \nthough\n another \nbeurocratic\n process to secure funding towards priorities\n, and there may not be agreement on priorities\n. This e\nssentially means that more time will be spent on this new process and making the case \nwith less \nresources \npotentially \nfor delivering the outcomes and outputs. \n&#xa0;\n6.2 \nThe \ndevolution of funds\n is welcome and over a longer period\n, but ideally \nit should be for local\n LEP area\ns\n to decide the best \norgansiation\n/ model for delivery\n. We see the benefit in developing a \nprogramme\n to address the range of challenges to help ensure the right conditions for growth and \ndelivering\n economic benefits. However, \nthere are concerns that \nthere is no guarantee that the LEP or indeed Government will agree the priorities for \nfunding for \nthis area. \nThere needs to be greater recognition of the role of \ndemocratically elected Members \nin agreeing priorities. Members \nhave a \nduty to serve their local areas \nand deliver key outcomes on behalf of their communities\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;7.1 \nHaving an agreed long term vision for growth and economic prosperity is an important starting point. This should be linked to an investment plan with clarity on priorities and \nkey outcomes anticipated over time \nto \nprovide greater certainty to investors regarding ambitions and expectations.\n&#xa0;\n7.2 \nGood collaboration and \na joined up approach on resources to support priorities\n is also helpful in terms of supporting unlocking growth potential\n. \nA\n key area which is pertinent is \nCommunity Infrastructure Levy where resources could be pooled towards delivering infrastructure\n priorities. \nThe funding generated by CIL doesn’t adequately cover the costs of infrastructure needed to support growth. However \nb\ny pooling \nsome \nCIL\n receipts \nacross a wider area, \nthere is greater potential to support \nthe delivery of strategic infrastructure priorities early\n. \n&#xa0;\n7.3 \nProviding local areas with greater freedoms and flexibilities, particularly in terms \nof\n funding will enable areas to ta\nke \nmore of the initiative to support the growth and prosperity of their local areas. One example that \nis providing \nsuccessful in \nCambridgeshire\n \ni\ns the creation of a Rolling Infrastructure Fund\n whereby an \ninitial £8 million o\nf Government funding was used to establish a rolling \nfund.\n This\n funding was originally used to fund the Guided \nBusway\n (£5.75 million) and to act as pump-priming funding for \nAddenbrookes\n Access Road (£2.25 million) during the 2007-08 financial year. During 2008-09 the money was recovered from the Guided \nBusway\n scheme a\nnd then \nreused\n to provide front-funding for the \nAddenbrookes\n Access Road, therefore resulting in all £8 million being used to support spending on this project. \nThe provision of this access road\n help\ned\n unlock up to 4,000 new homes on the Cambridge southern \nfringe \ndevelopment which otherwise would have been delayed due to \ncashflow\n/ recessionary impacts.\n&#xa0;\n7.4 \nIn addition to this, an equity investment of £8 million \nwas made to help bring forward the \ndevelopment as part of the Rolling Fund. \nT\nhese investments will \nno\nw \nrepay with interest, or an equity return, and the funds will then be available for investments to support housing growth across Cambridgeshire in the future. \n&#xa0;8.1 \nCurrently the lines of accountability are clear for local decision making on transport expenditure. Most funding for transport is allocated to the Local Transport Authorities through either the Integrated Transport Block or Maintenance Block by formula, \nwith some \nperiodic \ncompetitive bids for areas like \nPinchpioints\n, Growing Places, LSTF and BBAF.\n&#xa0;\n8.2 \nIn \nCambridgeshire\n funding is then allocated towards the range of requirements identified in the Area Transport Strategies. These have been developed working wi\nth County and Local District Members and clarify the policy objectives and identify the key measures and interventions needed to address issues and support growth. This process works successfully and well, and S106 funding is also collected towards mitigat\ning the impacts of growth and supports the aims\n of the strategies\n.  \n&#xa0;\n8.3 \nLooking forward, from 2015, while the formula grant element will remain with the Local Transport Authorities\n, the amount of funding is being top sliced and\n there is less certainty regard\ning arrangements for local decision making on transport expenditure\n for this and the major schemes funding\n. \n While LTB’s have been set up to receive the devolved funding, this will now be administered by the LEP’s through the single pot. However the assess\nment criteria and decision making processes are unclear. The other issue is that democratically elected Members are not necessarily the decision makers as the LEP’s are primarily business led\n, and the funding will support the LEP’s priorities\n. This is a co\nncern \nas \nthere may not be agreement on funding for priorities which could impact \non the potential for areas to address the key challenges in terms of transport and create the right conditions for growth.  \n&#xa0;\n8.4 \nMore consideration needs to be given the \nimportant role of the LTB in terms of decision making on transport funding. The LTB’s have been set up with clear lines of accountability, and assurance framework\ns\n setting out \nclear assessment and appraisal criteria to ensure value for money and democratic\n accountability. In the Greater Cambridge Greater Peterborough area discussions are taking place about aligning the LTB to better fit the LEP geography and wider remit regarding transport as there is recognition of the important role of this body in terms \nof supporting the LEP and recommending to the LEP a robust and deliverable \nprogramme\n that addresses the challenges and delivers economic benefits.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
