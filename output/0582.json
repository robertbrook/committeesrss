Founded in 2006, the company provides specialist knowledge and expertise in the following areas:\n&#xa0;\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUse of an in-house, novel software tool to assess \ns\npa\nce debris impact risks to\n spacecraft\n;\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDesign and optimisation of impact protection on spacecraft;\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDevelopment of \ninternational \nspace debris mitigation \nguidelines / \nstandards and their application to space systems;\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInnovative space debris mitigation technologies, one of which is currently being patented.\n&#xa0;\nDeclaration of Interests&#xa0;\nPHS Space Ltd provides technical advice and support on space debris matters to a variety of customers, including:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten Evidence&#xa0;\n1/              What are the strengths and weaknesses of the funding, organisation, and work of the European Space Agency?&#xa0;\n1\n.1\n/\n              \nT\nhe greatest strength of ESA is its \ntechnical \nstaff, whos\ne breadth and depth of\n knowledge across the organisation is significant. \nThis expertise, which has brought about\n many successful space \nmissions, s\nhould be\n developed as much as possible.\n \nFor example, more opportunities could be provided for the \ns\necondment of \nESA \nstaff to industry\n,\n national space agencies\n or\n the EU\n. \n&#xa0;\n1.\n2/\n              \nIn terms of\n organisation, ESA has a rigid\n hierarchical structure \nwhich is similar in many respects to a large civil service department\n. \nA flatter organisation with a matrix management system, if implemented correctly, \nwould\n allow greater flexibility in moving staff \nboth \nwithin \nand outside \nthe organisation\n. \nIt would\n also provide a closer relationship between senior management and the technical staff. \nThis should improve\n upward communication flow of importa\nnt advice from technical staff.\n&#xa0;\n1.\n3/\n              \nOne\n area requiring attention\n in ESA\n is t\nhe \nprocess \nthat industry has to follow when \nbiddi\nng for relatively low-value \ncompetitive tenders, \ni.\ne. those less than 500k euros. At present t\nhe process\n is too costly, time-consuming and complicated. This can act as a barrier \nto SMEs\n bidd\ning, since t\nhe size of the investment that must be made, and risk taken, may be a substantial proportion of the SME’s overall business.\n Therefore\n, SMEs are \nforced to consider bidding only for \nthose ESA \ncontracts \nthat they have a significant chance of winning. \nBy contrast, large organis\nations can absorb the \nhigh \nbidding costs much more readily, and therefore they can afford to \nbe more speculative when\n bidding for work. Thus the complexity and cost of the \nESA bidding \nprocess has an inherent \nbias in favour of large organis\nations.  \nThis clearly has a couple of\n (perhaps unintended) consequences. First, the \norganis\nation that wins a contract may not necessarily be the best one to undertake the work. Second, \nthe potential \nfor \nSMEs \nto grow \ncould be\n hindered.\n&#xa0;\n1.\n4/\n              \nAn\n aspect of the ESA \nbidding process that remains a cause for concern is \n“\njuste\n retour”\n. The existence of a\n geogra\nphical return requirement can force\n a bid consortium to include \nsome weaker partners in order to spread the geographical loading. Therefore, it seems inevitable that bid consortia will be sub-optimal in their make-up. \nAs a consequence, o\nne must \nalso presume that some of the resulting contract deliverables from a winning consortium will not be of the highest standard\n achievable\n.\n&#xa0;\n2/              In light of the European Commission’s recent Communication on relations between ESA and the EU (COM 2012 671), what relationship between ESA, the EU and the UK would provide the most effective governance regime? Why?&#xa0;\n2.1\n/\n              \nESA has accomplished much since its inception. There have been notable achievements across all of the space acti\nvity domains. However, given its\n budgetary cons\ntraints, and the emergence of EU\n funding of space-related activities, perhaps now is the time for ESA to focus on certain key areas. There should be a clear demarcation between ESA’s activities and those of the \nEU\n. \nThe greatest\n \ntechnological risk and \nchallenge comes from \nscience missions, \ninterplanetary missions and human spaceflight. \nIt could be argued that \nESA’s undoubted technical expertise would be put to best u\nse by concentrating on these particular\n areas. Where synergies and economies of scale exist, \nESA \nprojects \nsh\nould be pursued in collaboration with national space agencies within Europe\n, such as the UK Space Agency,\n or \nagencies outside of Europe.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n/\n              \nTo complement this approach\n, the \nEU\n could assume respo\nnsibility for \nunmanned, Earth orbital missions since these provide the most immediate \nand obvious \nsocietal benefits to European citizens.\n \nIn recent years the \nEU\n \nhas demonstrated its commitment to Earth orbital space, both in terms of use (e.g. GMES) and in terms of preservation of the environment for future generations (e.g. addressing the space debris problem).\n&#xa0;\n3/              How effective is the EU’s support for research and innovation in the space sector? What effect have changes to the Multi-Annual Financial Framework had on ESA and support for the space sector from the Horizon 2020 programme?&#xa0;\n3.1\n/\n              \nEU support for research and innovation has provided a significant \nboost to the \nEuropean \nspace sector\n, and\n has filled in some sizeable funding gaps\n. This is particularly evident in an area such as space debris\n research\n. Over the past \nthree years several large debris projects have been funded within FP7 to address a variety of important needs. These include the development of methods to mitigate the growth in \norbital \ndebris and technologies for \nactively removing\n debris \nfrom the \nenvironment. \nIn the light of concerns about the Kessler syndrome taking hold, i.e. the onset of an irreversible collision cascade in low Earth orbit\n (LEO)\n, the \nEU\n has approached the debris problem with a sense of urgency. This is lauda\nble. \nEU\n funding \nhas helped many European companies, especially SMEs, to develop promising ideas and technologies. In so doing, the competitiveness of European industry has also been improved. The upcoming Horizon 2020 programme looks set to continue that trend.\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n/\n              \nO\nne problem that the \nEU\n currently appears to suffer from is a lack of staff to oversee the \nspace-related \nresearch being undertaken. \nAt present the \nEU\n has limited in-house technical expertise\n, and therefore it has to invite outside experts to act as project reviewers. This can work quite well if there is a go\nod match between the aims of a project\n and the knowledge of the expert. However, experience shows that this is not always the case.\n Some projects have been\n reviewed by \nexperts who are not sufficiently qualified to provide meaningful inputs. If the \nEU\n is to provide effective oversight of research within Horizon 2020, then it needs to address this problem. One possible solution would be for ESA to provide a number of technical staff to the \nEU\n. This could be on a secondment basis or as a permanent transfer.\n&#xa0;\n4/              How effective has the UK Space Agency been and what improvements could be made? Is the UK effectively exploiting opportunities for growth in the space sector or could more be done?&#xa0;\n4.1\n/\n              \nT\nhe UK Space Agency’s National Space Technology Programme (NTSP) has \ngiv\nen much-needed assistance to\n the development of innovative technologies within the UK space sector. However, the level of investment would seem to fall short of that \nnecessary to satisfy\n the \naspiration\n of \ncreating a \n£40 billion\n-\nturnover \nspace industry \nwithin the UK \nby 2030.\n \nIn addition, c\nalls for proposals need to be more frequent and regular to ensure that promising new ideas can be\n developed quickly and retained by\n the UK\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n/\n              \nThe relationship between funding offered by the NTSP and that offered by the Technology Strategy Board\n (TSB)\n is unclear. It is presumed that there is coordina\ntion between these funding programme\ns regarding the technical \nrequirements in\n calls for proposals. However, an outsider to the process can have poor visibility and understanding of this. For example, it is not clear under what circumstances a proposal should be submitted to the NTSP rather than the TSB.\n&#xa0;\n5/              How resilient is the UK’s space-based infrastructure? Are threats from space debris or solar activity being appropriately mitigated? What role do, or should, ESA and the UK Space Agency play in addressing these issues?&#xa0;\n5.1\n/\n              \nOne of the leading international organisations for addressing the space debris problem is the Inter Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC). This is \nan international governmental forum for the worldwide coordination of activities related to the issues of man-made and natural debris in space. Recently \nIADC has studied the stability of the debris population in low Earth Orbit and found that the population is likely\n to increase by approximately\n 30% in the next 200 years. This projection assumes 90% implementation of mitigation measures in the design and operation of spacecraft (which is not currently achieved). \nIn view of this result, the IADC observes that t\nwo key elements \nare \nrequired for the long-term sustainability o\nf the future LEO environment.\n \nThe first defence is to encourage greater compl\niance with mitigation measures (\nsuch as those contained in the IADC’s space debris mitigation guidelines or \nthe \nISO 24113\n standard)\n. \nSecondly, active debris rem\noval (ADR) should be considered.\n The IADC study concludes that \n“\nthe international community should initiate an effort to investigate the benefits of environment remediation, explore various options, and support the development of the most cost-effective technologies in preparation for actions to better preserve the near-Earth environment for future generations\n”\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.\n2/\n              \nActive debris removal brings with it many challenges. Aside from the technical difficulties in \nsafely \nremoving debris, there are also political, legal and financial hurdles to be overcome.\n The UKSA should make a \nmeaningful contribution towards finding solutions to all of these problems. For example, on the technical side, the UK has \nsignificant \nexpertise in a number of areas, including:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.\n3/\n              \nThe UKSA should encourage \nand support \nthe dev\nelopment of promising new \ndebris mitigation / remediation \nideas, particularly those emerging from SMEs\n. Otherwise there is\n a risk that other countries will\n benefit from the UK’s innovations. At least one such idea is on t\nhe verge of being lost\n from\n the UK because of a lack of\n \nfunding\n opportunities\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.\n4/\n              \nThe\n UK Space Agency\n \nalso \nhas \na long-standing obligation\n to participate in international forums addressing the space debris problem. It h\nas satisfied this obligation\n with the help of a small number of experts who have provided the UKSA with technical support and advice on space debris matters for a number of years. \nAs a result the UKSA has been able to take a leading role in the development of international debris mitigation guidelines and standards, such as those published by the IADC, UN and ISO. This work is on-going, and has now been expanded to include recommendations relating to active debris removal (ADR). To ensure the UK can continue to have a positive influence on these activities, and therefore protect the commercial interests of \nthe \nUK \nspace \nindustry, it is very important that such representat\nion is maintained. However\n, budgetary pressures within the UKSA in recent years have reduced funding for the expert support to a point where meanin\ngful participation has been\n jeopardized.\n&#xa0;\n5.\n5/\n              \nThe UK cannot afford to w\nalk away from its obligations in\n \nthese \ninternational debris mitigation forums if it is serious about g\nrowing the space sector to achieve a £40 billion turnover by 2030\n. Activities such as monitoring and modelling the debris environment, and standardizing \nspacecraft design and operations to mitigate debris are inseparably bound with this economic aspiration. The UKSA should therefore reaffirm its commitment to international space debris mitigation efforts via the IADC, UN and ISO, and take immediate measures to reverse the decline in funding support for expert participation in these forums.\n&#xa0;\n5.\n6/\n              \nESA’s \nfunding of the space debris problem has been variable during the past decade\n. Approximately 10 years ago, a\n \nmanagement \ndecision was made to \ncurtail\n funding of \nspace debris \nresear\nch\n. The rationale for the decision is unclear. Since no serious collisions had happened up to that point, perhaps there was a perception that debris was not a significant problem that deserved funding. \nIn contrast,\n \nESA\n debris experts\n at that time were predicting that \ncollisions would be likely to start within a few years (based on \nsimulat\nions from long-term debris environment evolution models). As it happened, the first major \naccidental \ncollis\nion took place in February 2009\n and the environment has deteriorated substantially since then. It is worth noting that ESA funding of \nspace debris research has increas\ned\n noticeably\n in the past coupl\ne of years\n. This is a welcome development. \nHowever, given the level of concern about the debris problem\n now\n, perhaps there is\n \nscope for further improvement\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.\n7/\n              \nFinally, w\nithin ESA, technical experts are currently studying options for actively removing the \nEnvisat\n satellite from orbit. \nEnvisat\n,\n one of the la\nrgest spacecraft to be launched,\n orbits in a very popular and populous region \nof\n \nlow E\narth orbit\n. After 10 years of operation i\nt suffered a \nsudden and irrecoverable\n failure last year\n and, as a result, became \none of the\n most hazardous debris objects in LEO.\n \nUnfortunately, \nEnvisat\n will now remain in orbit for well over a century unless \nESA can find some method \nto remove it\n safely\n.\n Space debris experts in the UK are also considering possible solutions to this problem.\n&#xa0;\nApril 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
