Written evidence submitted by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (LAI 0038)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction[bold] [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Equality and Human Rights Commission welcomes the opportunity of making a submission to the Joint Committee on Human Rights (JCHR) inquiry 
[normal]into the implications for access to justice of the Government’s proposals for legal aid reform.  In preparing this submission, we have drawn on our response to the Ministry of Justice consultation: Transforming legal aid: delivering a more credible and eff
[normal]icient system
[normal]  and advice from Counsel in relation to that response.  We have also drawn from our Human Rights Review, published in 2012.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Also relevant to this submission is the Commission’s section 31 Assessment of the extent to which HM Treasury met
[normal] its legal obligations to consider the impact of Spending Review decisions on people sharing protected characteristics. This assessment included consideration of the Spending Review announcement of a consultation on major reforms to the legal aid system.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In considering these proposals, the Commission has taken account of the need for economies to be made in public services during a period of 
[normal]austerity.  However, this must be balanced against the UK’s human rights obligations and the requirements of EU la
[normal]w.  Account must also be taken of the obligations of the Ministry of Justice under Part 3 Equality Act 2010, which relates to the provision of services and performance of public functions.  Also relevant is the public sector equality duty under Section 149
[normal] of the Act, which requires public bodies to have due regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations when making decisions or formulating policy.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]C[bold]omments on the proposed introduction of a resid[bold]ence test for civil legal aid claimants, so as to limit legal aid to those with a ‘strong connection’ with the [bold]UK[bold] [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Civil legal aid is currently available regardless of nationality or residence, including for foreign nationals living outside the UK when 
[normal]they are bringing or defending proceedings in this country. The 
[normal]MoJ
[normal] proposes that applicants for civil legal aid would need to be lawfully resident in the UK at the time of applying for legal aid, as well as demonstrating that they had previously been resi
[normal]dent for at least 12 months (either immediately preceding the application or at some point in the past). The residence test would be carried out by the legal aid provider.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Commission’s assessment is that applying a residence test to legal aid applicants may, in particular cases, result in breaches of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which guarantees the right to a fair trial, as well as the pro
[normal]cedural aspects of other ECHR rights. This could affect certain individuals living in this country, or people living abroad whose rights have been breached by the UK (for example, by its armed forces).  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Account must also be taken of Article 14 ECHR, whic
[normal]h guarantees freedom from discrimination on any ground in the enjoyment of ECHR rights.  The 
[normal]MoJ
[normal] proposal is for a test which operates on the basis of residence in the UK, and as such it is more likely to have an adverse impact on non-UK nationals. It is s
[normal]trongly arguable that, in violation of Article 6 read with Article 14, this exclusion unjustifiably discriminates against the group of people who cannot satisfy the residence test, whether defined by the status of ‘non-UK national’ or ‘non-UK resident’. As
[normal] noted by senior counsel in an opinion on this issue recently published in Judicial Review journal,
[normal] where the state chooses to provide legal aid for civil proceedings, it cannot unjustifiably discriminate between the recipients of the scheme. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]Commission's analysis is that the statement of Equalities Impact in Annex K of the April 2013 consultation paper does not provide enough information and gives insufficient attention to whether proposals that are potentially indirectly  discriminatory, incl
[normal]uding the residence test,
[normal] can be objectively justified. 
[normal]The 
[normal]MoJ
[normal] also appears to have given little consideration to how the discriminatory impact of these proposals might be mitigated.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In seeking to justify the residence test proposals, the statement of 
[normal]Equalities Impact refers to the reduction of costs derived from the reform package and suggests that the Government's aim is to achieve this 'in ways that ensure limited public resources are targeted at those cases which justify it and those people who nee
[normal]d it, drive greater efficiency in the provider market and the Legal Aid Agency, and support our wider 
[normal]efforts to transform the justice system.'
[normal]  As noted in our response to the Transforming Legal Aid consultation, case law makes it clear that costs alone 
[normal]are not a legitimate aim that can support the justification of indirect discrimination.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the April 2013 consultation paper, the 
[normal]MoJ
[normal] 
[normal]recognised
[normal] the need for certain specific exceptions to the residence test; in particular, for asylum seekers and armed
[normal] forces personnel. In its response to the consultation, the Government has concluded that additional exceptions should be made: for babies under 12 months who are lawfully resident; for detention cases; for victims of trafficking, domestic violence and for
[normal]ced marriage; for cases relating to the protection of children; and for appeals before the Special Immigration Appeals Commission. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Commission's analysis supports the Government's reconsideration of the exceptions to the residence test, as well as its
[normal] decision to allow individuals a break of up to 30 days in the 12 month period of residence. However, it remains a concern that people who could not satisfy the test would include those who have been given leave to remain for less than a year or who are in
[normal] the first year of  living lawfully in the UK, including spouses, partners and children of long-term residents and EEA nationals, and people who have been granted refugee status. It also excludes British citizens who do not happen to have lived continuousl
[normal]y in the UK for a twelve month period.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Excluded individuals would not receive funding for categories of cases that the Parliament has decided are otherwise important enough to 
[normal]remain within the scope of civil legal aid,
[normal] including: homelessness, commun
[normal]ity care; claims for damages for false imprisonment; mistreatment by the police; misfeasance in public office; public law cases (included challenges to refusals of exceptional funding for legal aid). Also excluded would be foreign nationals who allege that
[normal] their human rights have been breached by agents of the UK state.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Ministry of Justice has 
[normal]emphasised
[normal] the role of 'exceptional circumstances' funding,
[normal] which would be made available by the Director of Legal Aid where a failure to fund the case would br
[normal]each the individual's rights under the ECHR or enforceable EU rights - or where funding is appropriate, having regard to the risk of such a breach.  Funding is limited to the minimum services required to meet these international obligations. While the Comm
[normal]ission acknowledges that exceptional funding does to some degree provide a safety net, its availability does not address the problem of clients being deterred from seeking legal advice in the first place, especially if they believe that they cannot satisfy
[normal] the residence test.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The exceptional funding scheme has been in operation since April 2013. Applications must be submitted to the Legal Aid Agency on a detailed form (14 pages in length), and legal advisers will not be paid for the time involved in tak
[normal]ing instructions from the client and completing the form unless the application for funding is successful.   The fact that providers must take on the risk of not being paid for this work may reduce their willingness to apply for exceptional funding. 
[normal]The P
[normal]ublic Law Project (PLP), which runs a project which assists with exceptional funding applications, has found the process to be onerous 
[normal]and complex, and ill-suited to applications made in person – especially where there are barriers relating to literacy, En
[normal]glish language skills or disability.
[normal]  This conclusion is supported by the small number exceptional funding applications, and their low success rate.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Commission notes that neither the April 2013 consultation paper, nor the Government response to 
[normal]the consultation, explains how the exceptional funding provisions would apply in practice to cases that do not satisfy the residence test.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Equalities Impact statemen
[normal]t published with the April 2013 
[normal]consultation paper suggests that the discriminatory im
[normal]pact of the residence test would, in part, be justified by the exceptional funding scheme. The scheme requires non-residents to establish an individual violation of their ECHR or EU rights, quite apart from the merits of the case for which they would be re
[normal]ceiving funding. As 
[normal]recognised
[normal] in the legal opinion cited above,
[normal] this high-threshold additional requirement is only imposed on non-residents.  As it is 
[normal]part of
[normal] the differential treatment, it cannot be used to justify the differential treatment that the re
[normal]sidence test would involve.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Commission's analysis also suggests the residence test would be difficult to operate in practice.  Lawyers and advisers without expertise in immigration law will not be in a position to determine a client's status accurately. Even a specialist immigrat
[normal]ion practitioner may not be able to ascertain whether or not the person is lawfully resident in the UK unless 
[normal]the client can produce all relevant documents.  Some people may lack evidence that they have been in the UK lawfully for 12 months - for example i
[normal]f they are British citizen or have a right of residence under EU law - or their status may be complicated or unclear for a range of reasons.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The proposed residence test could also deny legal aid to people living outside the UK who want to bring proceedi
[normal]ngs under domestic law because of serious human rights abuses by agents of the UK state. There is a risk that this exclusion would breach the strong procedural obligations under Article 2 ECHR (the right to life) and Article 3 ECHR (freedom from torture an
[normal]d inhuman or degrading treatment).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Implementing the proposed residence test could risk preventing litigation of the highest constitutional importance involving the unlawful killing or improper treatment of overseas nationals by UK troops. Examples of thes
[normal]e cases are:
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The cases of 
[normal]Baha
[normal] 
[normal]Mousa
[normal] (Al-
[normal]Skeini
[normal]) and Al-
[normal]Sweady
[normal], which resulted in public inquiries being established into the ill-treatment of Iraqi civilians and the alleged non-combat killings of Iraqi insurgents by British troops; 
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]R (
[normal]Alaa
[normal]’ 
[normal]Nassif
[normal] 
[normal]Jassim
[normal] Al 
[normal]Bazzouni
[normal]) v The Prime Minister &amp; Others,
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]which involved challenges to the guidelines under which British Intelligence and military agents participate in joint combat operations with third party states overseas; and 
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Ali 
[normal]Zaki
[normal] 
[normal]Mousa
[normal] v Secretary o
[normal]f State for 
[normal]Defence
[normal],
[normal] which concerned whether the processes set up to investigate allegations of ill-treatment by British forces in Iraq are sufficiently independent to satisfy the investigative duties arising under Articles 2 and 3 ECHR.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The residence te
[normal]st could also exclude UK residents who are not physically present in the United Kingdom when they become the victim of unlawful actions.  The 
[normal]Binyam
[normal] Mohammed litigation, for example, concerned UK residents who were kept out of the country as victims of unl
[normal]awful rendition and detention abroad.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If the residence test is implemented, such cases would be much less likely to be litigated in the UK courts or come to public attention - particularly as the Legal Aid Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 h
[normal]as now excluded legal aid for judicial reviews that do not have the potential to produce a direct benefit for the claimant.
[normal]  This will exclude funding for cases such as Maya Evans' judicial review concerning the transfer of detainees to Afghan custody. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]C[bold]omments on the proposed restriction on the scope of legal aid available to prisoners[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Transforming Legal Aid consultation paper proposed removing legal aid for all prison law matters except for cases involving a criminal charge; cases involving an ind
[normal]ividual's ongoing detention and liberty; and cases with an oral hearing which meet criteria set out in case law (for example, the seriousness of the charge or penalty; whether the 
[normal]prisoner is unable to present their own case).
[normal]  As legal aid would no longe
[normal]r be available for cases relating to treatment in prison, the internal complaints system and the prison discipline procedures would be the first port of call.  Additional safeguards would be provided by the Prison and Probation Ombudsman.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In its response 
[normal]to the consultation, the Government has now accepted that legal aid should remain available for Parole Board proceedings where the Board is considering whether to direct release, and advice and assistance in relation to sentence calculation where the date 
[normal]of release is disputed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In responding to the April 2013 consultation, the Commission drew attention to several examples of 'treatment cases' involving human rights issues for which legal aid would no longer be available.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Potential challenges to failures to grant childcare resettlement leave to women prisoners, engaging Article 8 ECHR (the right to respect for private 
[normal]and family life) and Article 14;
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The removal of babies from mothers in prison (R (P) v SSHD, R (Q) v SSHD [
[normal]2001]) e
[normal]ngaging Articles 8 and 14 ECHR;
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Interferences with prisoners’ mail, an issue which may engage Article 6, 8 and 10 ECHR (R v SSHD, ex p Simms [2000]) 
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Cases concerning the lawfulness of practices which jeopardise the confidentiality of communication
[normal]s between prisoners and their lawyers (R v SSHD, ex p Leech [1994] and R (Daly) v SSHD [2001] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A failure to provide suitable food (vegetarian, 
[normal]halal
[normal] or kosher) to prisoners, engaging Article 9 ECHR (the right to respect for freedom of thought, conscience
[normal] and religion) and Article 14.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Commission's analysis remains that there would be risks from the proposed exclusion of this type of case, where the scrutiny of the courts has in the past helped in clarifying whether certain prison practices are lawful.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Although legal aid would remain available for sentence planning and minimum term review applications, it would be excluded for matters such as segregation and 
[normal]categorisation
[normal].  In the Commission’s analysis, this distinction is problematic because 
[normal]categorisa
[normal]tion
[normal] can have an impact on the release date of prisoners.  For example, in the case of R(
[normal]Hirst
[normal]) v SSHD [2001] EWCA 
[normal]Civ
[normal] 378, the Court of Appeal 
[normal]recognised
[normal] that the re-
[normal]categorisation
[normal] of a post-tariff life sentence prisoner from ‘C’ to ‘B’ would delay his ev
[normal]entual release by at least two years.  A related problem may arise for less serious disciplinary matters that do not qualify for criminal legal aid (i.e., they do not involve the award of additional days’ imprisonment), because – if upheld – they may still
[normal] have an impact on subsequent decisions concerning 
[normal]categorisation
[normal], release on temporary 
[normal]licence
[normal] or home detention curfew. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Another major consideration is the impact of limiting legal aid on disabled prisoners, especially those with mental health or learni
[normal]ng difficulties.  The April consultation paper stated that the due regard had been paid to the impact of these proposals on people sharing protected characteristics, including prisoners with learning disabilities and/or 
[normal]mental health issues. However, the C
[normal]ommission’s analysis is that the Equalities Impact statement did not ascertain whether the aim of the reforms, and the degree to which they are likely to be achieved by the proposals, are proportionate to any discriminatory impact.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It also appears that 
[normal]the 
[normal]MoJ
[normal] relied on information that significantly under-records the proportion of prisoners who are disabled.  The Equalities Impact statement quotes data from the Legal Aid Agency showing that six per cent of prisoners had a declared disability.  Other est
[normal]imates vary from five per cent (according to the prison database) to 34 per cent of surveyed prisoners self-reporting disability.
[normal] In relation to mental health, the proportion of mentally ill people in the prison population is not measured routinely.
[normal]  It has been reported that one in ten prisoners has serious mental health problems,
[normal]  and a national evaluation shows that over 70 per cent of adult prisoners have a severe mental illness, substance misuse problem or both.
[normal]  In addition, 62 per cent of ma
[normal]le and 57 per cent of female sentenced prisoners have a personality disorder.
[normal] During 2012, there were over 23,000 recorded incidents of self-harm among prisoners.
[normal]  Research has also identified that 20 to 30 per cent of offenders have learning disabilitie
[normal]s or difficulties that interfere with their ability to cope with the criminal justice system.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]These statistics all indicate the importance of reasonable adjustments being made to support prisoners’ access to the prison complaints process.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We are awa
[normal]re that the National Offender Management Service provides screening with the aim of ensuring that reasonable adjustments are made for disabled prisoners. However, the evidence suggests that many prisoners with disabilities are not recorded as such, for a v
[normal]ariety of reasons.  Crucially, the initial screening in many prisons is by means of self-declaration and many prisoners are reluctant to declare a disability for fear of exposing their vulnerability, or are unaware of their disabled status.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Article 6 in
[normal]cludes the right to legal aid in circumstances where withholding it would make the assertion of a civil claim practically impossible.
[normal] The Commission’s analysis suggests that removing treatment cases from the scope of legal aid may deprive those with subst
[normal]antial mental health or learning difficulties of their right to a fair hearing under Article 6 ECHR because it would be practically impossible for them to have a fair hearing.  Furthermore in some cases, even with reasonable adjustments, some disabled pris
[normal]oners using the internal complaints procedure will lack the equality of arms required by Article 6 ECHR.   For disabled prisoners as a group, this may amount to unjustifiable discrimination, in breach of Article 6 read with Article 14.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]MoJ
[normal] also 
[normal]proposes abolishing the separate, specialist contract category for prison law.  Legal aid providers currently offering this expertise would only be able to continue the work if they are able and 
[normal]willing to expand their remit to cover all other aspects of c
[normal]riminal 
[normal]defence
[normal].  Few specialist prison law firms are likely to be able to expand in this way and, in the Commission’s analysis, this loss of expertise could have a serious impact on prisoners’ access to justice.
[normal]Comments on the proposal that providers of [bold]legal services in applications for judicial review should only be paid for work done on the case if the Court grants permission for the application to proceed[bold]As noted in the Commission’s response to the 
[normal]MoJ
[normal] consultation on ‘Judicial review: proposals for 
[normal]reform’ (December 2012), judicial review has the important function of acting as a check on the exercise of power by public authorities, and to ensure that the decisions of public authorities are lawful. Judicial review is also the principal means of testi
[normal]ng the compatibility of public authority decisions with rights under the ECHR.  It is sometimes the 
[normal]only
[normal] means of appeal from an internal complaints procedure that is not in itself compliant with Article 6 ECHR because it does not qualify as an ‘independen
[normal]t and impartial 
[normal]tribunal’.At
[normal] present, legal aid is available – subject to a means and merits test – to fund applications for permission in judicial review cases. The 
[normal]MoJ
[normal] is proposing that legal aid would not cover the costs of the application except, retro
[normal]spectively, where permission is granted by the court. This means that much of the pre-permission work in judicial review cases would be at the provider’s risk. Although Legal Help would be available for legal research and pre-action correspondence, it does
[normal] not cover the important preparation work that follows the pre-action stage.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Responses to the 
[normal]MoJ
[normal] consultation, including the Commission’s own response, argued that this proposal not only targeted weak judicial 
[normal]review cases, but would also unfairly affect
[normal] cases with merit where the case concludes before the court considers the application for permission, and no order as to costs is made.  The 
[normal]MoJ
[normal] had also failed to consider the genuine uncertainty faced by practitioners when assessing the merits of a judic
[normal]ial review – particularly as they do not have possession of all relevant documents and because judges have inconsistent approaches to permission applications.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]MoJ
[normal] has now revised its proposals in response to these concerns. It proposes to allow the L
[normal]egal Aid Agency discretion to pay providers in certain cases that conclude before a permission decision by the court, where costs have not been agreed as part of a settlement. The discretion would be exercised according to certain criteria, including the r
[normal]eason for the provider not obtaining a costs agreement, the extent to which the clients obtained the remedy or redress they were seeking in the proceedings, and the likelihood that the court would have granted permission had the application been considered
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Government is currently consulting on this proposal as part of a package of further reforms to judicial review.
[normal]  These reforms, designed to tackle what the Government perceives to be the ‘abuse of judicial review,’
[normal] include the following proposals:
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Amending (by legislation) the test for ‘standing’ to prevent cases being brought by claimants with ‘little or no direct interest in the matter’
[normal];
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Where judicial reviews are challenging procedural defects (for example, a failure to consult), allowing 
[normal]the ‘no difference’ 
[normal]defence
[normal] to be considered at the permission stage – or else changing the threshold for assessing whether the same decision would be reached to  ‘highly likely’ rather than ‘inevitable’
[normal];
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Considering alternative mechanisms for resolving di
[normal]sputes relating to the Public Sector Equality Duty (PSED) and seeking evidence on the volume and nature of PSED challenges
[normal];
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Changing the costs rules so the court would routinely consider awarding the costs of an oral permission hearing to the unsuccessful 
[normal]party
[normal];
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Tightening up the approach to protective costs orders, including a presumption of a ‘cross cap’
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Thus, the impact of the revised proposal for legal aid in permission cases needs to be seen as part of this wider package of proposed reforms.  The Com
[normal]mission will be responding separately to the 
[normal]MoJ
[normal] consultation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]While the revised legal aid proposal meets some of the points that the Commission raised in its response to the April 2013 consultation, our analysis is that it will not address all of them.  
[normal]The claimant will still have to run a series of financial risks because of uncertainty about whether or not the case will be given permission by the court, whether it will become academic or be conceded before permission is granted, whether or not 
[normal]the defe
[normal]ndant will agree to pay costs as part of a settlement agreement, whether the court will order ‘inter 
[normal]partes
[normal]’ costs following a costs hearing, or whether the Legal Aid Agency will use its discretion to pay costs at legal aid rates.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The proposed list of fac
[normal]tors that the Legal Aid Agency would take into account in considering the exercise of discretion will offer little certainty to claimant solicitors. Given the unpredictability of the outcome of applications for permission when considered by the court, one 
[normal]may assume that the Legal Aid Agency’s assessment of the likelihood that the application would have been granted will be equally uncertain. As pointed out in the Commission's earlier consultation response, the new funding regime will make it almost impossi
[normal]ble to accommodate ‘rolled up’ hearings – where the question of permission is adjourned to be decided at the same time as the substantive claim.  Claimants’ lawyers will want to avoid the risk of preparing the whole case without knowing whether permission 
[normal]will be granted.  While rolled up hearings can offer a cost efficient use of the court’s time, judges will be mindful of the increased financial risks for claimants and may be unwilling to list legally aided cases in this way.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the Commission’s analysis
[normal], the revised proposal for legal aid in applications for permission in judicial review may well deter important applications in cases that would have succeeded.  This could have a negative impact on access to justice, raising concerns about compliance with
[normal] Article 6 ECHR and access to justice for victims of breaches of other Articles of the ECHR. It may also have an impact on individuals’ ability to bring judicial reviews based wholly or partly on alleged breaches of the PSED. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Commission's analysis s
[normal]uggests that it is important to monitor the cumulative impact of the current and proposed reforms to identify and mitigate, as far as possible, any adverse effects on an individual’s right of access to the courts to challenge the exercise of Government pow
[normal]er.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It should be noted that, following the December 2012 consultation on judicial review, the Government has now removed the right to an oral renewal of an application where it is assessed by a judge, on the papers, as being ‘totally without merit’. The 
[normal]Commission's analysis supports the suggestion put forward in some responses to the April 2013 consultation that, as an alternative, the Government should consider only withholding legal aid where a permission application is certified as ‘totally without me
[normal]rit.’
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]C[bold]omments on the proposal that legal aid should be removed for all cases assessed as having ‘borderline’ prospects of success.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]‘Borderline’ cases are those for which the outcome is difficult to predict, and where the chances of success are not clearly less than 50 per cent but cannot be stated to be better than 50 per cent. They are not the same as cases with a ‘poor’ prospect of 
[normal]success. At present, funding is granted for around 100 borderline cases per year, many of which have a significant wider public interest or overwhelming importance to the client. The 
[normal]MoJ
[normal] proposes to exclude borderline cases from legal aid, subject to a rig
[normal]ht of appeal to an independent funding adjudicator.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]UK law is developed not just by statute but also by decisions of the higher courts, setting precedents that the lower courts must follow. Many important cases dealing with novel legal arguments that ul
[normal]timately changed the law could not have been categorized in advance as having better than 50 per cent chance of success. One example is the case of 
[normal]Rahmatullah
[normal] v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs &amp; 
[normal]Anor
[normal] (2012), where the application h
[normal]ad previously been refused by the Divisional Court. However, the Court of Appeal, followed by the Supreme Court, unanimously accepted that habeas corpus was available to a Pakistani citizen detained by British forces in Iraq.  
[normal]It would be reasonable to des
[normal]cribe as ‘borderline’ any case in which two of the UK's higher courts have reached different conclusions. For instance, in HJ and HT v Secretary of State for the Home Department
[normal] the Supreme Court held for the first time that refugee status could be based 
[normal]on persecution for reasons of homosexuality, and that there was no need to assess whether or not a person could avoid persecution by being 'discreet' if returned to their country of origin.  This case had previously been rejected by the Court of Appeal (fo
[normal]llowing an earlier Court of Appeal authority). Pursuing 'borderline' cases such as this one allows the law to be clarified for everyone’s benefit – including for the Government – and guides the lower courts for future cases. This represents a saving in cos
[normal]ts in the longer term.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the Commission’s analysis, the proposal to cease funding for borderline cases, while offering limited cost savings, could have unintended downstream consequences given the significance of many such cases in emerging areas of law.
[normal] It is widely accepted that predicting the prospects of success in individual claims is not a 
[normal]straightforward task.  In the Commission’s assessment, if the Government implements the proposal to withdraw legal aid for borderline cases, the courts could be d
[normal]eprived of the opportunity of resolving some important legal questions. In addition, too much would rest on the vicissitudes of the ‘prospects of success’ assessment in deciding whether such cases should be publically funded. 
[normal]&#xa0;
