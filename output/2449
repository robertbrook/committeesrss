Written evidence submitted by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (LAI 0038)default&#xa0;defaultIntroductiondefault default&#xa0;
defaultThe Equality and Human Rights Commission welcomes the opportunity of making a submission to the Joint Committee on Human Rights (JCHR) inquiry 
defaultinto the implications for access to justice of the Government’s proposals for legal aid reform.  In preparing this submission, we have drawn on our response to the Ministry of Justice consultation: Transforming legal aid: delivering a more credible and eff
defaulticient system
default  and advice from Counsel in relation to that response.  We have also drawn from our Human Rights Review, published in 2012.
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultAlso relevant to this submission is the Commission’s section 31 Assessment of the extent to which HM Treasury met
default its legal obligations to consider the impact of Spending Review decisions on people sharing protected characteristics. This assessment included consideration of the Spending Review announcement of a consultation on major reforms to the legal aid system.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIn considering these proposals, the Commission has taken account of the need for economies to be made in public services during a period of 
defaultausterity.  However, this must be balanced against the UK’s human rights obligations and the requirements of EU la
defaultw.  Account must also be taken of the obligations of the Ministry of Justice under Part 3 Equality Act 2010, which relates to the provision of services and performance of public functions.  Also relevant is the public sector equality duty under Section 149
default of the Act, which requires public bodies to have due regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations when making decisions or formulating policy.  
default&#xa0;
defaultCdefaultomments on the proposed introduction of a residdefaultence test for civil legal aid claimants, so as to limit legal aid to those with a ‘strong connection’ with the defaultUKdefault default&#xa0;
defaultCivil legal aid is currently available regardless of nationality or residence, including for foreign nationals living outside the UK when 
defaultthey are bringing or defending proceedings in this country. The 
defaultMoJ
default proposes that applicants for civil legal aid would need to be lawfully resident in the UK at the time of applying for legal aid, as well as demonstrating that they had previously been resi
defaultdent for at least 12 months (either immediately preceding the application or at some point in the past). The residence test would be carried out by the legal aid provider.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Commission’s assessment is that applying a residence test to legal aid applicants may, in particular cases, result in breaches of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which guarantees the right to a fair trial, as well as the pro
defaultcedural aspects of other ECHR rights. This could affect certain individuals living in this country, or people living abroad whose rights have been breached by the UK (for example, by its armed forces).  
default&#xa0;
defaultAccount must also be taken of Article 14 ECHR, whic
defaulth guarantees freedom from discrimination on any ground in the enjoyment of ECHR rights.  The 
defaultMoJ
default proposal is for a test which operates on the basis of residence in the UK, and as such it is more likely to have an adverse impact on non-UK nationals. It is s
defaulttrongly arguable that, in violation of Article 6 read with Article 14, this exclusion unjustifiably discriminates against the group of people who cannot satisfy the residence test, whether defined by the status of ‘non-UK national’ or ‘non-UK resident’. As
default noted by senior counsel in an opinion on this issue recently published in Judicial Review journal,
default where the state chooses to provide legal aid for civil proceedings, it cannot unjustifiably discriminate between the recipients of the scheme. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultCommission's analysis is that the statement of Equalities Impact in Annex K of the April 2013 consultation paper does not provide enough information and gives insufficient attention to whether proposals that are potentially indirectly  discriminatory, incl
defaultuding the residence test,
default can be objectively justified. 
defaultThe 
defaultMoJ
default also appears to have given little consideration to how the discriminatory impact of these proposals might be mitigated.  
default&#xa0;
defaultIn seeking to justify the residence test proposals, the statement of 
defaultEqualities Impact refers to the reduction of costs derived from the reform package and suggests that the Government's aim is to achieve this 'in ways that ensure limited public resources are targeted at those cases which justify it and those people who nee
defaultd it, drive greater efficiency in the provider market and the Legal Aid Agency, and support our wider 
defaultefforts to transform the justice system.'
default  As noted in our response to the Transforming Legal Aid consultation, case law makes it clear that costs alone 
defaultare not a legitimate aim that can support the justification of indirect discrimination.
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the April 2013 consultation paper, the 
defaultMoJ
default 
defaultrecognised
default the need for certain specific exceptions to the residence test; in particular, for asylum seekers and armed
default forces personnel. In its response to the consultation, the Government has concluded that additional exceptions should be made: for babies under 12 months who are lawfully resident; for detention cases; for victims of trafficking, domestic violence and for
defaultced marriage; for cases relating to the protection of children; and for appeals before the Special Immigration Appeals Commission. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Commission's analysis supports the Government's reconsideration of the exceptions to the residence test, as well as its
default decision to allow individuals a break of up to 30 days in the 12 month period of residence. However, it remains a concern that people who could not satisfy the test would include those who have been given leave to remain for less than a year or who are in
default the first year of  living lawfully in the UK, including spouses, partners and children of long-term residents and EEA nationals, and people who have been granted refugee status. It also excludes British citizens who do not happen to have lived continuousl
defaulty in the UK for a twelve month period.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultExcluded individuals would not receive funding for categories of cases that the Parliament has decided are otherwise important enough to 
defaultremain within the scope of civil legal aid,
default including: homelessness, commun
defaultity care; claims for damages for false imprisonment; mistreatment by the police; misfeasance in public office; public law cases (included challenges to refusals of exceptional funding for legal aid). Also excluded would be foreign nationals who allege that
default their human rights have been breached by agents of the UK state.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Ministry of Justice has 
defaultemphasised
default the role of 'exceptional circumstances' funding,
default which would be made available by the Director of Legal Aid where a failure to fund the case would br
defaulteach the individual's rights under the ECHR or enforceable EU rights - or where funding is appropriate, having regard to the risk of such a breach.  Funding is limited to the minimum services required to meet these international obligations. While the Comm
defaultission acknowledges that exceptional funding does to some degree provide a safety net, its availability does not address the problem of clients being deterred from seeking legal advice in the first place, especially if they believe that they cannot satisfy
default the residence test.   
default&#xa0;
defaultThe exceptional funding scheme has been in operation since April 2013. Applications must be submitted to the Legal Aid Agency on a detailed form (14 pages in length), and legal advisers will not be paid for the time involved in tak
defaulting instructions from the client and completing the form unless the application for funding is successful.   The fact that providers must take on the risk of not being paid for this work may reduce their willingness to apply for exceptional funding. 
defaultThe P
defaultublic Law Project (PLP), which runs a project which assists with exceptional funding applications, has found the process to be onerous 
defaultand complex, and ill-suited to applications made in person – especially where there are barriers relating to literacy, En
defaultglish language skills or disability.
default  This conclusion is supported by the small number exceptional funding applications, and their low success rate.
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Commission notes that neither the April 2013 consultation paper, nor the Government response to 
defaultthe consultation, explains how the exceptional funding provisions would apply in practice to cases that do not satisfy the residence test.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Equalities Impact statemen
defaultt published with the April 2013 
defaultconsultation paper suggests that the discriminatory im
defaultpact of the residence test would, in part, be justified by the exceptional funding scheme. The scheme requires non-residents to establish an individual violation of their ECHR or EU rights, quite apart from the merits of the case for which they would be re
defaultceiving funding. As 
defaultrecognised
default in the legal opinion cited above,
default this high-threshold additional requirement is only imposed on non-residents.  As it is 
defaultpart of
default the differential treatment, it cannot be used to justify the differential treatment that the re
defaultsidence test would involve.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Commission's analysis also suggests the residence test would be difficult to operate in practice.  Lawyers and advisers without expertise in immigration law will not be in a position to determine a client's status accurately. Even a specialist immigrat
defaultion practitioner may not be able to ascertain whether or not the person is lawfully resident in the UK unless 
defaultthe client can produce all relevant documents.  Some people may lack evidence that they have been in the UK lawfully for 12 months - for example i
defaultf they are British citizen or have a right of residence under EU law - or their status may be complicated or unclear for a range of reasons.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe proposed residence test could also deny legal aid to people living outside the UK who want to bring proceedi
defaultngs under domestic law because of serious human rights abuses by agents of the UK state. There is a risk that this exclusion would breach the strong procedural obligations under Article 2 ECHR (the right to life) and Article 3 ECHR (freedom from torture an
defaultd inhuman or degrading treatment).
default&#xa0;
defaultImplementing the proposed residence test could risk preventing litigation of the highest constitutional importance involving the unlawful killing or improper treatment of overseas nationals by UK troops. Examples of thes
defaulte cases are:
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe cases of 
defaultBaha
default 
defaultMousa
default (Al-
defaultSkeini
default) and Al-
defaultSweady
default, which resulted in public inquiries being established into the ill-treatment of Iraqi civilians and the alleged non-combat killings of Iraqi insurgents by British troops; 
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultR (
defaultAlaa
default’ 
defaultNassif
default 
defaultJassim
default Al 
defaultBazzouni
default) v The Prime Minister &amp; Others,
default 
default 
defaultwhich involved challenges to the guidelines under which British Intelligence and military agents participate in joint combat operations with third party states overseas; and 
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAli 
defaultZaki
default 
defaultMousa
default v Secretary o
defaultf State for 
defaultDefence
default,
default which concerned whether the processes set up to investigate allegations of ill-treatment by British forces in Iraq are sufficiently independent to satisfy the investigative duties arising under Articles 2 and 3 ECHR.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe residence te
defaultst could also exclude UK residents who are not physically present in the United Kingdom when they become the victim of unlawful actions.  The 
defaultBinyam
default Mohammed litigation, for example, concerned UK residents who were kept out of the country as victims of unl
defaultawful rendition and detention abroad.
default&#xa0;
defaultIf the residence test is implemented, such cases would be much less likely to be litigated in the UK courts or come to public attention - particularly as the Legal Aid Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 h
defaultas now excluded legal aid for judicial reviews that do not have the potential to produce a direct benefit for the claimant.
default  This will exclude funding for cases such as Maya Evans' judicial review concerning the transfer of detainees to Afghan custody. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCdefaultomments on the proposed restriction on the scope of legal aid available to prisonersdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe Transforming Legal Aid consultation paper proposed removing legal aid for all prison law matters except for cases involving a criminal charge; cases involving an ind
defaultividual's ongoing detention and liberty; and cases with an oral hearing which meet criteria set out in case law (for example, the seriousness of the charge or penalty; whether the 
defaultprisoner is unable to present their own case).
default  As legal aid would no longe
defaultr be available for cases relating to treatment in prison, the internal complaints system and the prison discipline procedures would be the first port of call.  Additional safeguards would be provided by the Prison and Probation Ombudsman.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn its response 
defaultto the consultation, the Government has now accepted that legal aid should remain available for Parole Board proceedings where the Board is considering whether to direct release, and advice and assistance in relation to sentence calculation where the date 
defaultof release is disputed.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn responding to the April 2013 consultation, the Commission drew attention to several examples of 'treatment cases' involving human rights issues for which legal aid would no longer be available.
default&#xa0;
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPotential challenges to failures to grant childcare resettlement leave to women prisoners, engaging Article 8 ECHR (the right to respect for private 
defaultand family life) and Article 14;
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe removal of babies from mothers in prison (R (P) v SSHD, R (Q) v SSHD [
default2001]) e
defaultngaging Articles 8 and 14 ECHR;
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultInterferences with prisoners’ mail, an issue which may engage Article 6, 8 and 10 ECHR (R v SSHD, ex p Simms [2000]) 
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCases concerning the lawfulness of practices which jeopardise the confidentiality of communication
defaults between prisoners and their lawyers (R v SSHD, ex p Leech [1994] and R (Daly) v SSHD [2001] 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA failure to provide suitable food (vegetarian, 
defaulthalal
default or kosher) to prisoners, engaging Article 9 ECHR (the right to respect for freedom of thought, conscience
default and religion) and Article 14.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Commission's analysis remains that there would be risks from the proposed exclusion of this type of case, where the scrutiny of the courts has in the past helped in clarifying whether certain prison practices are lawful.
default&#xa0;
defaultAlthough legal aid would remain available for sentence planning and minimum term review applications, it would be excluded for matters such as segregation and 
defaultcategorisation
default.  In the Commission’s analysis, this distinction is problematic because 
defaultcategorisa
defaulttion
default can have an impact on the release date of prisoners.  For example, in the case of R(
defaultHirst
default) v SSHD [2001] EWCA 
defaultCiv
default 378, the Court of Appeal 
defaultrecognised
default that the re-
defaultcategorisation
default of a post-tariff life sentence prisoner from ‘C’ to ‘B’ would delay his ev
defaultentual release by at least two years.  A related problem may arise for less serious disciplinary matters that do not qualify for criminal legal aid (i.e., they do not involve the award of additional days’ imprisonment), because – if upheld – they may still
default have an impact on subsequent decisions concerning 
defaultcategorisation
default, release on temporary 
defaultlicence
default or home detention curfew. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAnother major consideration is the impact of limiting legal aid on disabled prisoners, especially those with mental health or learni
defaultng difficulties.  The April consultation paper stated that the due regard had been paid to the impact of these proposals on people sharing protected characteristics, including prisoners with learning disabilities and/or 
defaultmental health issues. However, the C
defaultommission’s analysis is that the Equalities Impact statement did not ascertain whether the aim of the reforms, and the degree to which they are likely to be achieved by the proposals, are proportionate to any discriminatory impact.  
default&#xa0;
defaultIt also appears that 
defaultthe 
defaultMoJ
default relied on information that significantly under-records the proportion of prisoners who are disabled.  The Equalities Impact statement quotes data from the Legal Aid Agency showing that six per cent of prisoners had a declared disability.  Other est
defaultimates vary from five per cent (according to the prison database) to 34 per cent of surveyed prisoners self-reporting disability.
default In relation to mental health, the proportion of mentally ill people in the prison population is not measured routinely.
default  It has been reported that one in ten prisoners has serious mental health problems,
default  and a national evaluation shows that over 70 per cent of adult prisoners have a severe mental illness, substance misuse problem or both.
default  In addition, 62 per cent of ma
defaultle and 57 per cent of female sentenced prisoners have a personality disorder.
default During 2012, there were over 23,000 recorded incidents of self-harm among prisoners.
default  Research has also identified that 20 to 30 per cent of offenders have learning disabilitie
defaults or difficulties that interfere with their ability to cope with the criminal justice system.
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultThese statistics all indicate the importance of reasonable adjustments being made to support prisoners’ access to the prison complaints process.  
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are awa
defaultre that the National Offender Management Service provides screening with the aim of ensuring that reasonable adjustments are made for disabled prisoners. However, the evidence suggests that many prisoners with disabilities are not recorded as such, for a v
defaultariety of reasons.  Crucially, the initial screening in many prisons is by means of self-declaration and many prisoners are reluctant to declare a disability for fear of exposing their vulnerability, or are unaware of their disabled status.  
default&#xa0;
defaultArticle 6 in
defaultcludes the right to legal aid in circumstances where withholding it would make the assertion of a civil claim practically impossible.
default The Commission’s analysis suggests that removing treatment cases from the scope of legal aid may deprive those with subst
defaultantial mental health or learning difficulties of their right to a fair hearing under Article 6 ECHR because it would be practically impossible for them to have a fair hearing.  Furthermore in some cases, even with reasonable adjustments, some disabled pris
defaultoners using the internal complaints procedure will lack the equality of arms required by Article 6 ECHR.   For disabled prisoners as a group, this may amount to unjustifiable discrimination, in breach of Article 6 read with Article 14.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultMoJ
default also 
defaultproposes abolishing the separate, specialist contract category for prison law.  Legal aid providers currently offering this expertise would only be able to continue the work if they are able and 
defaultwilling to expand their remit to cover all other aspects of c
defaultriminal 
defaultdefence
default.  Few specialist prison law firms are likely to be able to expand in this way and, in the Commission’s analysis, this loss of expertise could have a serious impact on prisoners’ access to justice.
defaultComments on the proposal that providers of defaultlegal services in applications for judicial review should only be paid for work done on the case if the Court grants permission for the application to proceeddefaultAs noted in the Commission’s response to the 
defaultMoJ
default consultation on ‘Judicial review: proposals for 
defaultreform’ (December 2012), judicial review has the important function of acting as a check on the exercise of power by public authorities, and to ensure that the decisions of public authorities are lawful. Judicial review is also the principal means of testi
defaultng the compatibility of public authority decisions with rights under the ECHR.  It is sometimes the 
defaultonly
default means of appeal from an internal complaints procedure that is not in itself compliant with Article 6 ECHR because it does not qualify as an ‘independen
defaultt and impartial 
defaulttribunal’.At
default present, legal aid is available – subject to a means and merits test – to fund applications for permission in judicial review cases. The 
defaultMoJ
default is proposing that legal aid would not cover the costs of the application except, retro
defaultspectively, where permission is granted by the court. This means that much of the pre-permission work in judicial review cases would be at the provider’s risk. Although Legal Help would be available for legal research and pre-action correspondence, it does
default not cover the important preparation work that follows the pre-action stage.
default&#xa0;
defaultResponses to the 
defaultMoJ
default consultation, including the Commission’s own response, argued that this proposal not only targeted weak judicial 
defaultreview cases, but would also unfairly affect
default cases with merit where the case concludes before the court considers the application for permission, and no order as to costs is made.  The 
defaultMoJ
default had also failed to consider the genuine uncertainty faced by practitioners when assessing the merits of a judic
defaultial review – particularly as they do not have possession of all relevant documents and because judges have inconsistent approaches to permission applications.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultMoJ
default has now revised its proposals in response to these concerns. It proposes to allow the L
defaultegal Aid Agency discretion to pay providers in certain cases that conclude before a permission decision by the court, where costs have not been agreed as part of a settlement. The discretion would be exercised according to certain criteria, including the r
defaulteason for the provider not obtaining a costs agreement, the extent to which the clients obtained the remedy or redress they were seeking in the proceedings, and the likelihood that the court would have granted permission had the application been considered
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Government is currently consulting on this proposal as part of a package of further reforms to judicial review.
default  These reforms, designed to tackle what the Government perceives to be the ‘abuse of judicial review,’
default include the following proposals:
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAmending (by legislation) the test for ‘standing’ to prevent cases being brought by claimants with ‘little or no direct interest in the matter’
default;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhere judicial reviews are challenging procedural defects (for example, a failure to consult), allowing 
defaultthe ‘no difference’ 
defaultdefence
default to be considered at the permission stage – or else changing the threshold for assessing whether the same decision would be reached to  ‘highly likely’ rather than ‘inevitable’
default;
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultConsidering alternative mechanisms for resolving di
defaultsputes relating to the Public Sector Equality Duty (PSED) and seeking evidence on the volume and nature of PSED challenges
default;
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChanging the costs rules so the court would routinely consider awarding the costs of an oral permission hearing to the unsuccessful 
defaultparty
default;
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTightening up the approach to protective costs orders, including a presumption of a ‘cross cap’
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThus, the impact of the revised proposal for legal aid in permission cases needs to be seen as part of this wider package of proposed reforms.  The Com
defaultmission will be responding separately to the 
defaultMoJ
default consultation.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhile the revised legal aid proposal meets some of the points that the Commission raised in its response to the April 2013 consultation, our analysis is that it will not address all of them.  
defaultThe claimant will still have to run a series of financial risks because of uncertainty about whether or not the case will be given permission by the court, whether it will become academic or be conceded before permission is granted, whether or not 
defaultthe defe
defaultndant will agree to pay costs as part of a settlement agreement, whether the court will order ‘inter 
defaultpartes
default’ costs following a costs hearing, or whether the Legal Aid Agency will use its discretion to pay costs at legal aid rates.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe proposed list of fac
defaulttors that the Legal Aid Agency would take into account in considering the exercise of discretion will offer little certainty to claimant solicitors. Given the unpredictability of the outcome of applications for permission when considered by the court, one 
defaultmay assume that the Legal Aid Agency’s assessment of the likelihood that the application would have been granted will be equally uncertain. As pointed out in the Commission's earlier consultation response, the new funding regime will make it almost impossi
defaultble to accommodate ‘rolled up’ hearings – where the question of permission is adjourned to be decided at the same time as the substantive claim.  Claimants’ lawyers will want to avoid the risk of preparing the whole case without knowing whether permission 
defaultwill be granted.  While rolled up hearings can offer a cost efficient use of the court’s time, judges will be mindful of the increased financial risks for claimants and may be unwilling to list legally aided cases in this way.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the Commission’s analysis
default, the revised proposal for legal aid in applications for permission in judicial review may well deter important applications in cases that would have succeeded.  This could have a negative impact on access to justice, raising concerns about compliance with
default Article 6 ECHR and access to justice for victims of breaches of other Articles of the ECHR. It may also have an impact on individuals’ ability to bring judicial reviews based wholly or partly on alleged breaches of the PSED. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Commission's analysis s
defaultuggests that it is important to monitor the cumulative impact of the current and proposed reforms to identify and mitigate, as far as possible, any adverse effects on an individual’s right of access to the courts to challenge the exercise of Government pow
defaulter.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt should be noted that, following the December 2012 consultation on judicial review, the Government has now removed the right to an oral renewal of an application where it is assessed by a judge, on the papers, as being ‘totally without merit’. The 
defaultCommission's analysis supports the suggestion put forward in some responses to the April 2013 consultation that, as an alternative, the Government should consider only withholding legal aid where a permission application is certified as ‘totally without me
defaultrit.’
default&#xa0;defaultCdefaultomments on the proposal that legal aid should be removed for all cases assessed as having ‘borderline’ prospects of success.default&#xa0;
default‘Borderline’ cases are those for which the outcome is difficult to predict, and where the chances of success are not clearly less than 50 per cent but cannot be stated to be better than 50 per cent. They are not the same as cases with a ‘poor’ prospect of 
defaultsuccess. At present, funding is granted for around 100 borderline cases per year, many of which have a significant wider public interest or overwhelming importance to the client. The 
defaultMoJ
default proposes to exclude borderline cases from legal aid, subject to a rig
defaultht of appeal to an independent funding adjudicator.  
default&#xa0;
defaultUK law is developed not just by statute but also by decisions of the higher courts, setting precedents that the lower courts must follow. Many important cases dealing with novel legal arguments that ul
defaulttimately changed the law could not have been categorized in advance as having better than 50 per cent chance of success. One example is the case of 
defaultRahmatullah
default v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs &amp; 
defaultAnor
default (2012), where the application h
defaultad previously been refused by the Divisional Court. However, the Court of Appeal, followed by the Supreme Court, unanimously accepted that habeas corpus was available to a Pakistani citizen detained by British forces in Iraq.  
defaultIt would be reasonable to des
defaultcribe as ‘borderline’ any case in which two of the UK's higher courts have reached different conclusions. For instance, in HJ and HT v Secretary of State for the Home Department
default the Supreme Court held for the first time that refugee status could be based 
defaulton persecution for reasons of homosexuality, and that there was no need to assess whether or not a person could avoid persecution by being 'discreet' if returned to their country of origin.  This case had previously been rejected by the Court of Appeal (fo
defaultllowing an earlier Court of Appeal authority). Pursuing 'borderline' cases such as this one allows the law to be clarified for everyone’s benefit – including for the Government – and guides the lower courts for future cases. This represents a saving in cos
defaultts in the longer term.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the Commission’s analysis, the proposal to cease funding for borderline cases, while offering limited cost savings, could have unintended downstream consequences given the significance of many such cases in emerging areas of law.
default It is widely accepted that predicting the prospects of success in individual claims is not a 
defaultstraightforward task.  In the Commission’s assessment, if the Government implements the proposal to withdraw legal aid for borderline cases, the courts could be d
defaulteprived of the opportunity of resolving some important legal questions. In addition, too much would rest on the vicissitudes of the ‘prospects of success’ assessment in deciding whether such cases should be publically funded.
