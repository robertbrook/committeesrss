[[[Executive Summary]]]The answers to the following eight questions are based on my experience of working in meteorology and hydrology for the last 50 years (see ‘My background’ below). I have no ties with the IPCC and no involvement with any coal, oil or gas organisation. My answers are as objective as possible. Questions are in bold font, answers in italics. Questions concerning government policy are not considered; only scientific matters are addressed.&#xa0;My backgroundI was head of Applied Physics at the Institute of Hydrology (now the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology) for 25 years, since when I have been Director of TerraData Ltd, a consultancy in environmental monitoring. All of this work has concerned the development and use of instruments for measuring the main climatic variables and has involved travel to many remote parts of the world where I have witnessed first-hand how the climate is measured under a great variety of conditions. I am currently working on better snowfall measurements in Antarctica, improved methods of measuring air temperature and investigating how climate model projections of temperature compare with the instrument record. I am a Fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society (RMetS) and have written several books (www.ianstrangeways.org.uk) and many articles and papers, as well as giving talks and university lectures (the Open University and Newcastle University), on these interrelated topics. I was awarded the Gordon Manley Weather Prize in 2005 ‘for outstanding contributions to the RMetS journal Weather’ and the Vaisala Award in 2012 ‘in recognition of my work in the field of observation and instrumentation of significant value to the science of meteorology’.  The questions addressed in this note are very important indeed and being directly related to the above work, called for a response from me.&#xa0;
