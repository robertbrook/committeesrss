"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nT\nransport for London\n (SRN 050)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;1.\n              \nIntroduction&#xa0;1.1\n              \nWe are grateful for \nthe opportunity to contribute to the Committee’s inquiry \n              \ninto \nthe Strategic Road Network\n. \n&#xa0;\n1.\n2\n              \nWe welcome the publication of the \nAction for Roads\n Command Paper\n as it \nprovides clarity on the way in which the national strategic road network, integral to London’s own growth and development plans, will be developed.\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n              \nW\nhil\ne \nthe Mayor is responsible f\nor the major \nroads in London\n (amounting to five per cent of the network)\n,\n through the Transport\n for London Road Network (TLRN)\n, \nwith more local roads being the responsibility of the London boroughs\n, this strategy matters to \nLondon\n in the following ways:\nmotorway\n network in the vicinity of London\n will affect London's roads, which are already among the busiest and most congested in the country.\n&#xa0;\n1.4    \n  \nThrough the Mayor’s Roads Task Force\n (RTF),\n London has developed an\n \n              \nambitious vision\n \nand direction for all its roads\n,\n with \nthree\n \naims:\n&#xa0;\n2\n.\n              How will the policies set out in the Government’s ‘Action for Roads’ Command Paper improve the strategic road network for all road users, whilst also improving the environment? &#xa0;\n2.1  \n              \nWe welcome the D\nepartment \nf\nor \nT\nransport\n’s \n(\nDfT’s\n) \nvision for Britain’s road\ns\n \n              \nand agree that a well-functioning road network and a well-protected \n              \nenvironment are not mutually \nexclusive. The new structure and committed \n              \nfunding for the Highways Agency\n (\nHA) outlined in the report should enable \n              \nbetter collaboration between the HA\n \nand\n other strategic agencies such as \n              \nTransport for London\n, as the quality of the national road network impacts on \n              \nthe London network\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.2 \n              \nHowever, we recommend that the report should more strongly emphasise the varied uses of roads and the differing dema\nnds\n placed upon the roads by their \nusers. \nFor London, t\nhe \nRTF \nidentified six functions of roads and streets – to enable movement, to provide space for ‘living’, to unlock development potential, to enable deliveries and other kerbside activity, to contribut\ne to safety, and to contribute to an improved environment. \nAlthough ‘movement’ is key, many of these other functions \nwould be relevant to the national strategic road network.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n              \nFurthermore, the RTF recommended that both the ‘movement’ and the ‘place’ function of roads and streets should inform the way they are managed and developed. \nIt \nproposed a framework, whic\nh we have\n adopted, consisting of nine street types representing those\n with low to strategic importance for ‘movement’ and for ‘place’. The RTF\n \nthen set out priorities and minimum service standards for other users for each of the nine street types.\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n              \nA toolkit of appropriate interventions was then set out for each street \ntype. \nFor roads in London \nwith strategic importance for \n‘\nmovement\n’ and local ‘place’ importance\n (\nie\n the most relevant to the national strategic road network)\n, the RTF proposed the following approach to ‘movement’ and ‘place’:\n&#xa0;\nPrioritiesProviding for other usersTools&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.5\n              \nDe\nspite a strong emphasis on improving ‘place’, the \nRTF recommended that \nthe road network still needed \nto fulfil its movement function\n - that \nthe road network as a whole must continue to operate reliably and offer reasonable journeys times for essential user\ns.\n&#xa0;\n2.6\n              \nTo achieve this it\n proposed that measures to mitigate \nagainst any \nincrease in congestion – through either or both of demand management and the provision of alternative space – would be essential and should be investigated. \n&#xa0;\n2.7\n              \nThe resulting \napproach can be summarised, therefore, as to apply specific measures to each section of road to ensure it meets the needs of its users according to its street-type, and to also apply strategic measures to ensure the road network as a whole continues to ful\nfil its movement role.\n&#xa0;\n2.8\n              \nWe \nconsider \nthat \nthis approach is most likely to ensure the needs of all users (and the envir\nonment) is likely to be met.  We are \ncurrently applying the street-type approach to the TLRN\n \n(as well as working with willing borough\ns\n \nto apply it to their roads) and exploring innovative ways in which to manage de\nmand and to provide alternative\n/replacement space for vehicles to mitigate congestion impacts.\n&#xa0;\n2.9\n              \nWe\n \nare happy to discuss the application of\n \nthe RT\nF approach \nwith \nthe \nDfT\n and HA \nfurther in relation to \nthe\n \ndevelopment and implementation of their ambitious plans for \nEngland’s \nroads\n to best meet the needs of all road users and improve the environment\n.\n&#xa0;\n3\n.\n              \nHow does the Government’s policy for roads link with planning for other                 transport modes?&#xa0;\n3.1\n              \n‘Action for Roads’\n makes the point\n \nthat the Government is investing significantly in all forms of transport in England, especially in the rail network.\n \nIt \nsays\n,\n given the extent of \npopulation \ngrowth\n and in the movement of freight\n, \nthat \nnot all journeys can be removed from the road network and \nthat \nthe \nnature of many journeys means that other modes cannot always offer an \nalternative \nto car travel on the strategic road network.\n&#xa0;\n3.\n2\n              \nHowever, t\nh\ne extent\n of the Government’s \njoined-up approach\n is not described in detail within ‘Action for Roads’ but\n is \nbriefly \noutlined in the \nDfT’s\n \nsubsequent \ndocument ‘Transport – an engine for growth’, published August 2013\n. We\n welcome\n this further document which \ncalls fo\nr ‘thinking of our transport network as a connected whole, not a series of separate systems’. \n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nThis position is consistent with the\n Mayor’s Transport Strategy\n which sets out a balanced approach across modes to supporting economic growth and development, improving quality of life and achieving other goals in London. It is also consistent with \nthe\n view\n of the RTF. \nThis is not a question of competition between roa\nd and public transport\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.\n4\n    \nWe\n \ntherefore \nwelcome\n the Government’s inten\ntion, described in ‘Transport an\n           \nengine for gr\nowth’ to make clear\n \nfive \nyear funding provisions for the Highways Agency, Transport for London, HS2, local highways maintenance, local major schemes (outside London) and integrated transport. \nThis better aligns with the current rail investment planning and delivery process.\n W\ne bel\nieve that \nthis more \nco-ordinated approach between road\n, \nrail\n and London \ninvestment strategies \nis essential to meet the needs of all users\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.5\n              \nInvestment both in the strategic road and rail \nnetworks,\n and in London’s strategic transport networks must \ncontinue to\n \nrecognise London’s context of population and economic growth.  This will be \ncritical in\n \ndelivering the full potential of London’s growth areas and the economic potential in all parts of the city\n. T\nhe road networks alone, whether strategic or lo\ncal, will not be able to fully accommodate\n this\n growth, which is projected to see London’s population grow to 10 million, and employment grow to 5.6 million people by 2031\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.\n6\n              \nI\nn this respect we welcome the intention of a future Roads Investment Strategy\n being part of a wider integrated approach to investm\nent in all modes of transport. \nW\ne strongly encourage \nG\novernment to ensure that investment decisions on roads and rail occur in an aligned and timely manner that focuses on addressing key problems both on\n the road and rail networks, whilst ensuring that this investment supports wider spatial, economic, social and environmental objectives.\n&#xa0;\n3.\n7\n              \nW\ne welcome the \nr\neference\n in ‘Action for Roads’\n to the\n \nstrategic road network’s linkages to local networks, and in \nLondon’s case \nthis would apply \npa\nrticularly where HA\n motorways interface with London’s own\n \nroad net\nworks which are critical points\n.\n  \nWe \nalso \nwelcome the acknowledgement that walking and cycling investments\n, \nwhich enable more sustainable ways of travel on the \nroad n\network\n, also form part of the plans \nfor the strategic road network\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.8 \n              \nHowever, w\ne \nconsider that demand management will also be required to meet our strategic goals. The \nRTF\n \nhas hig\nhlighted vario\nus aspects for us\n to explore, including re-timing and ‘\nremoding\n’ freight and servicing, smarter charging, smart work centres and practices, next generation travel demand management schemes, active network management, parking policy and land use planning. W\ne would like to see greater recognition of these tools in the development of the strategic Roads Investment Strategy in so far as they apply to this network.\n&#xa0;\n3.\n9\n              \nThe commitment \nin ‘Action for Roads’ \nto greater funding certainty and flexibility for the str\nategic\n \nroad network through the establishment of a Roads Investment Strategy is to be welcomed.  However, such an investment strategy cannot operate in isolation from planning mechanisms and funding streams for other transport modes, in particular those fo\nr \nthe national rail network\n, and the Mayor’s transport networks in London.\n \nIn add\ni\ntion\n, the establishment of Road Investment Strategies must not be to the\n \ndetriment of either the scope of, or investment levels for, the \nn\national Rail Investment Strategy or \nfor the heavily\n-\nused transport networks within London.  Onl\ny \nthrough the proper resourcing of all elements of our strategic \ntransport \nnetworks can the demand for travel in and a\nround London be met in the most \neconomically, environmentally and financially s\nustainable way.  \n&#xa0;\n4\n.\n              How reliable is the Government’s forecast for growth in demand for the               strategic road network? How should the Government deal with               uncertainty in its forecast?&#xa0;4.1    \nGrowth forecasts for demand on the strategic network are importa\nnt for us as \n         \nthey\n will impact on the level of traffic on London’s roads. \nThe way in which the \n         Government deals with uncertainty is also important to us, as it will determine \n         \nhow\n we interpret them alongside our own forecasts. \nIn its \nreporting of the \n         \ncurrent\n forecasts, the \nDfT\n takes account of uncertainty in population \n         \nforecasting\n, growth in GDP and the price of oil by setting out a range of future \n         \nout-tur\nns\n in terms of traffic growth. \nGovernment de\nfines a central case although \n         \nthis\n is not presented as \nthe most likely scenario or the \nbest scenario for \n         \nplanning\n. \nThe \nDfT\n says it will continue to review how it should represent \n         \nuncertainty\n in the forecasts.  \nWe \nsupport this \napproach.\n              \n4.2    \nThe \nDfT\n (o\nn page 1 of \nRoad Transport Forecasts 2013)\n makes clear\n \n         \nthat\n the Government forecasts for the growth in demand for the strategic road \n  \n         \nnetwork\n in England should not be viewed as what \ni\nt think\ns\n will happen bu\nt \n  \n         \nshould\n be treated as what may happen based on:\n&#xa0;\n4.3    \nThere \nare\n areas of further uncertainty. The \nDfT\n acknowledges (o\nn page 7, Box \n   \n         \n2 of its document \nRoad Transport Forecasts 2013\n) that its forecasts are \n  \n         \ndesigned\n to project national traffic levels and not regional or local traffic levels.  \n         \nThe \nDfT\n also accepts that it needs to revisit its London forecast, particularly in \n         \nrelation\n to several key factors which are not yet taken into account in producing \n         \nthe\n traffic forecasts.\n These are:\n&#xa0;\n4.4     \n              \nThe above \nfactors\n would add considerable complexity to forecasting the \n   \n          \n              \ngrowth\n in demand for the strategic road network.  However\n, we\n support the \n          \n              \nDfT’s\n view that G\novernment forecasts should address these issues in order \n          \n              \nto\n \nimprove the \nforecasts.\n&#xa0;\n4.5\n              \nWe \nrecognise the challenges of forecasting and, especially in the context of\n \nsubstantial projected population growth in the UK and London, believe this is a challenge well worth addressing.  \nWe\n welcome the recognition by \nDfT\n of the need to \nstrengthen some aspects of its road traffic forecasting, especially for regional and l\nocal areas \nand \nwe are \nwilling to work with the D\nepartment \nto assist in this\n task\n, especially on sharing our current analysis on the drivers of demand\n.\n&#xa0;\n5\n.\n                How can we improve the reliability and efficiency of travel on the               strategic road network? What impact will new technology have? &#xa0;\n5.1\n              \nOur work w\nith the RTF\n concluded that a broad set of measures is required to achieve all the desired outcomes for London’s roads and streets\n over the \nnext \ntwenty or so years\n, including \nthe \nefficient and reliable movement on the strategic road network in London. These are\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnsuri\nng infrastructure and assets are fit for the future\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMore efficient / flexible use of space\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIntelligent systems and management\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nChanging behaviour / managing demand\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSubstitute/relocated/enhanced capacity\n&#xa0;\n5.2 \n              \nAll five of these will be required to improve \nreliability and efficiency of London’s strategic road network, as described in our response to Question 1\n, and could be considered for the \nnational strategic road network\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.3\n              \nI\nnvesting in new technology will enable us to significantly improve our capabil\nity to manage flows on London’s strategic roads more effectively. This will enable us to better respond to planned events and incidents as they occur, and to \nhelp\n mitigate the impact on congestion of higher levels of cycling and ‘place’ improvements.\n \nThe \nvision\n \noutlined in \nAction for Roads\n, of technology playing an\n \never\n-\nincreasing role in improving traffic management and safety on the UK’s\n \nstrategic road network,\n \nis one we \ntherefore \nshare in relation to Lo\nndon’s strategic road network. \n&#xa0;\n5.4 \n              \nWe are currently extending \nSCOOT\n \nto a further 1500 sites. SCOOT can increase the effective cap\nacity of a junction by about 12 per cent\n. We are also developing\n an\n ‘active network management’ capability which will \nenable us \nto manage the volume of flows acr\noss the network and could be used, for example, to \nprotect \ncritical parts of the strategic road network\n \nfrom becoming \noverly \ncongested. We are also developing new technology including ‘co-operative systems’ which would enable better real time management of\n the network, responding almost instantly to incidents on the network, for example. \n&#xa0;\n5.5\n              \nWhile this technology creates the essential foundation for the reliable and efficient operation of the strategic network, it alone would be insufficient to cater for \nlonger term growth in London. It is probable that this is also the case for the national strategic road network.\n&#xa0;\n5.6\n              \nWe are\n therefore investigating the case for further demand management measures to reduce \npressure on the network\n as well as the case for p\nroviding substitute, relocated or enhanced \nroad space\n.\n Anal\nysis conducted for the RTF\n concluded that \nthe application of both \ndemand management \nand\n \nincreased road space\n \nmeasures would be most effective at supporting long term growth.\n&#xa0;\n5.7\n              \nIn particular, we \nare\n looking at the extent to which out-of-hours deliveries could be encouraged and the extent to which this could relieve congestion. Other measures being explored include targeted behaviour change initiatives, ‘c\nar \nlite\n’\n development in \ngrowth areas, and s\npatially targeted initiatives in inner and outer London such as ‘G\nreen zones\n’, c\nar clubs\n, \nDIY streets\n and \nmeasures to complement cycling investment. All these measures are likely to be relevant to the national strategic road network.\n&#xa0;\n5.8\n              \nWe are\n investigat\ning measures \nto \nprovid\ne\n additional space\n. These range \nfrom junction improvements, fly\n-\nunders\n, mini-tunnels through to longer cross-city and orbital tunnels\n as means to better cater for essential strategic movement whilst mitigating the impact i\nt can have on local communities. \nAgain, we suggest\n that such measu\nres c\nould be considered\n, where appropriate,\n for the national strategic road network to ensure reliable and efficie\nnt movement in the longer term.\n&#xa0;\n6.  \n              \nWhat mechanisms are there for Government to increase investment in                        strategic roads and attract new investors? Are there good examples               from other countries that could be applied in the UK? &#xa0;\n6.1\n      \nThere are several mechanisms by which the Government could increase investment in strategic roads, which would benefit the London’s roads by improving traffic flow and relieving congestion. These mechanisms include investing more in pension funds and provi\nding stability for revenue streams. \nThe proposed new structure for the HA, the Roads \nInvestment Strategy \nand greater certainty on the funding for HA outlined\n \nin \nAction for Roads\n should help \nto \ndeliver a long\n-\nterm plan for the road network and attract inves\ntment from the private sector.\n&#xa0;\n6.2     \n              \nIn terms of increasing investment in strategic road\ns\n, there should be greater \n          \n              \nfocus\n on encouraging investment from pension funds, sovereign wealth funds \n          \n              \nand\n similar. Pension funds are able to provide funding on a large scale and \n          \n              \nare\n (in the current market) relatively cheaper than bank funding and but more \n          \n              \nimportantly\n they can support the project through the whole investment cycle.  \n        \n          \n              \nA key factor to securing this is to structure the opportunity as a low risk, low \n          \n              \nvolatility\n investment with long\n-\nterm revenue streams.  Bond financing should \n   \n         \n              \nalso\n be considered as another suitable source for fu\nnding and maintaining the \n         \n              \nstrategic\n road network wholly or in conjunction with the pension funds (and \n              \nthe\n \nlike).\n&#xa0;\n6.3 \n   \n              \nPrivate investors will also be seeking \na separate\n and clearly defined revenue \n \n         \n              \nstream\n to cover payments and cer\ntainty around future investment to gain the \n         \n              \nconfidence\n needed to plan ahead and invest.\n&#xa0;\n6.4\n \n              \nThe proposed \nfive-\nyear funding settlement for \nthe \nHA will help in providing some\n \nstability around revenue streams. The HA will benefit from having a \nfixed\n \nproportion of the current taxes paid by motorist\ns\n (V\nehicle \nE\nxcise \nD\nuty\n and\n \nfuel duty) allocated to\n \nit, as this will establish an independent revenue stream, and attract private\n \ninvestment.\n&#xa0;\n6.5 \n \n              \nNonetheless with the growing deficit and reducing taxe\ns paid by motorist due \n              \nto\n \nvehicle efficiencies, the HA may still require a separate revenue stream in \n              \nsome form of a user charge to be able to deliver the new capacity and attract \n              \nthe long\n-\nterm private investment.\n&#xa0;\n6.6 \n  \n              \n‘Standard tolling’ or ‘user cha\nrging’ can in some cases be seen as too \n        \n              \nrudimentary\n and may be more suitable for a new crossing with no alternatives.  \n        \n              \nIt may not be the most appropriate way to fund a network of strategic roads \n   \n        \n              \nrequiring\n different level of upgrade and investment. An alternative approach, \n  \n        \n              \nsuch\n as setting up an ‘access charge’ to use the strategic road network could \n    \n        \n              \nbe\n like buying \na \nseason ticket and may have a reduced impact on changing \n              \nthe\n \nuser \nbehaviour. \nThe use of differential charges that cater for both ‘heavy \n              \nusers’\n \nand \n‘light users’ may also be worth consider\ning\n.\n&#xa0;\n6.7\n \n \n \n              \nAnother alternative could be a ‘user fee’ based on mileage travelled on the \n    \n        \n              \nstrategic\n road network. Under this model those who use it the most and \n              \nbenefit from the infrastructure pay the most.  This approach is possibl\ny\n more \n              \ntransparent\n than an access charge in that is reflects the cost of each journey \n        \n              \nand\n is therefor\ne more likely to have a more direct impact on behaviour \n              \nchange.\n&#xa0;\n6.8 \n  \n              \nThis approach has been adopted by oth\ner countries around the world. \nAs \n   \n        \n              \nexamples\n, a similar system is in operation in New Zealand for some vehicle \n        \n              \ntypes\n, while Oregon’s Department for Transport have recently completed pilot \n        \n              \nstudies\n for a similar system and are proposing to introduce it by 2015. \n&#xa0;\n6.9\n              \nThe RTF recommended that we\n explore the potential for developer contributions to contribute\n towards\n funding for road improvements. \nThis source may also be applicable to the national strategic road network.\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n              \n              \n                     \n7\n Split Cycle Offset Optimisation Technique.  This is a dynamic traffic control system which responds reactively to traffic flow approaching a junction on a second-by-second basis and adapts signal timings for each arm of the junction accordingly.\n"
