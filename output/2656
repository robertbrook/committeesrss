defaultThe Children’s Society supports nearly 50,000 children and young people every year through our specialist 
defaultservices and children’s centres. We believe in achieving a better childhood for every child but have a particular focus on children who have nowhere else to turn, such as children living in poverty, young refugees, children at risk on the streets, disabled
default children and children in trouble with the law. We seek to give a voice to children and young people and influence policy and practice so they have a better chance in life.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe believe that every child has the right to a decent home that their family can a
defaultfford. We welcome the opportunity to raise our concerns with the committee about the impact that reforms to housing support in the welfare system could have on this.

defaultIntroductiondefault&#xa0;
defaultThis submission focuses on the following three key areas of reform:
default&#xa0;
default1. Local Housing Allowance (LHA) 
defaultreforms
default2. The household benefit cap
default3. Localisation of support with housing costs
default4. Housing support in Universal Credit
default&#xa0;defaultKey issues:

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default1. Local Housing Allowance (LHA) reformsdefault&#xa0;
defaultHousing Benefit for clai
defaultmants in the private rental sector has gone through a period of radical change:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAs a result of a combination of these changes, if rental prices rise rapidly, prices will increasingly 
defaultdraw away from eligible rents for LHA purposes.
default&#xa0;
defaultFigure 1: Shortfall between LHA eligible rent (English averagedefault) and actual expected rent 2010-2013default, by size of propertydefault&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe losses are greatest for larger families. A low income
default family with four or more children requiring a four bedroom property  in private rental accommodation can expect to see a shortfall of £24 per week (£1250 per year) as a result of changes to LHA entitlements between 2010 and 2013.
default&#xa0;
defaultFor a family in a three 
defaultbedroom home, between 2010 and 2013, the average eligible rent of a private rental property has fallen by around £8 per week. Over the same period
default, we would have expected rents to have risen by £6 per week. This would leave a £14 per week shortfall betwee
defaultn eligible rents and actual expected rental prices – around £730 per year.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis is shown in the table below. Clearly, the change from the 50
defaultth
default to 30
defaultth
default percentile of local rents had a major impact in 2011. However, since then, the gap has continued to widen as a result of LHA rates rising more slowly than private rents.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultFigure 2: Eligible rent and expected rent for three bedroom property (English averadefaultge) 2010-2013default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is notable that the government did not expect changes to LHA entitlement to increase eligible rents with inflation rather than local rents, to create behavioural change, given the costs of moving home.
default&#xa0;
default“No beha
defaultvioural impact is assumed over the forecast period as differences in rents will be small in the early years compared to the transaction costs of moving. The current estimate of the anticipated reduction in benefit expenditure is in the order of £400m in 20
default14/15 (real terms, 2012/13 prices).”
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are concerned that that given the costs of moving home and the lack of availability of affordable private rental properties, many families will reduce disposable income as a consequence of reductions in their LHA 
defaultpayments. This means that money intended to cover the costs of living is needed to cover shortfalls in assistance with housing costs.
default&#xa0;
defaultGiven the evidence that private rental prices are increasing faster than Housing Benefit rates, it is unsurprising that i
defaultt is becoming increasingly common for families to become homeless as a result of Assured Shorthold Tenancies ending and not being renewed.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe table below shows the number of households accepted as being owed a main homelessness duty by their local auth
defaultority, who lost their last home as a result of the end of an Assured Shorthold Tenancy. The number have nearly tripled since 2010.
default&#xa0;
defaultFigure 3: households accepted as owed a main homelessness duty by the Local Authority who lost their last home as a result odefaultf the end of an Assured Shorthold Tenancy: 2010-2013default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAs private sector housing is becoming increasingly unaffordable, access to social housing is also becoming increasingly limited. Numbers of households on social housing waiti
defaultng lists has increased by more than 800,000 since 1997, including a rise of around 100,000 since 2010 (see figure 4). 
default&#xa0;
defaultFigure 4: Local Authorities’ housing waiting lists 1997-2012default&#xa0;
defaultIt is crucial that the lowest income families a
defaultre able to afford the cost of their home. We are concerned that for those families on the very lowest incomes the increasing gaps between eligible rents for Housing Benefit and private rents, combined with increasing inaccessibility of social housing are t
defaultogether making housing unaffordable for many families with children. 
default&#xa0;
defaultDuring a recent debate in the House of Lords regarding linking the uprating of local LHA rates to CPI, Lord Freud committed to review the situation if local allowance rates and rents 
defaultbecome out of step
default.
defaultRecommendation 1: The government should commit to a review of the affordability of private rental sector accommodation following reforms to LHA since 2011. default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default2. The household benefit capdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe household benefit cap applies a maximum 
defaultbenefit entitlement of £500 per week for most out of work families with children. Housing Benefit entitlement is reduced in order to reduce household entitlement to this limit
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe following table shows how the income of families in private rental housin
defaultg after the cap is applied, may compare to the poverty line for their household
default.

default&#xa0;
defaultFor families with 4 or more children with an average private rental sector rent, benefit levels fall increasingly far below the poverty line as a result of the cap. For families with 5 or more children, their income after housing costs could be less than 
default5
default0%
default of the poverty line.
default&#xa0;
defaultSuggestions have been made that the level of the cap be further reduced – one MP suggested a cap of £17000 (£327 per week). This would reduce disposable incomes after the cap is applied still further.
default A couple
default with four or more chi
defaultldren 
defaultc
defaultould have their disposable income limited to around £91 per week
default (about £2 per person per day)
default –
default with which they would need to cover all of their household needs, including food, clothes, transport and utilities.  T
defaulthis is less than 20% of the income
default they would need to be lifted out of poverty.
default&#xa0;defaultFigure 5. Disposable income after cap applied (out of work couple with average private rental sector rent for a relevant property size, and varying numbers of children) compared to poverty line for each defaulthousehold size.default&#xa0;
defaultThe benefit cap is already having severe consequences for households in the private rental sector, including households who succeed in making the move into work.
default&#xa0;
defaultOne The Children’s Society family support worker s
defaultupporting a family affected by the benefit cap told us:
default&#xa0;
default“The family have been served a section 21 notice as a result of their inability to pay full rent.
default&#xa0;
default They have been awarded a discretionary housing payment however there is still a shortfall.
default&#xa0;
default The family is large - 5 children - and have lost £92 pound a week
default with the introduction of the cap.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultSince the introduction of the cap mum has got herself a part time job of 16 hours which now means she comes off of the benefit cap and can now reapply for housing benefit to assist.
default&#xa0;
default They are still being evicted though 
defaultas they have already gone into arrears.”
default&#xa0;
defaultWe welcome the Government’s assurances that they will monitor the impact of the benefit cap and review it in 2014 following its first year of operation.  
default&#xa0;
defaultRecommendation 2: Given that around three quarters of those affected by the cap are children, it is particularly important that the review pays specific regard to the impact of the benefit cap on the well-being of children.  It is important that as part ofdefault this the review considers – default&#xa0;
default3. Localisation of support with housing costsdefault&#xa0;
defaultIncreasingly, support with housing costs is determined on a l
defaultocal, and discretionary basis. Local authorities have been provided with additional funding for Discretionary Housing Payments (DHP) to help deal with difficult cases caused by reforms, such as the benefit cap. Additionally, following the abolition of part
defaults of the discretionary Social Fund, local authorities have been allocated resources to introduce local welfare assistance schemes to provide support for families.  
default&#xa0;
defaulti. Discretionary Housing Payments default&#xa0;
defaultIn 2010/11 £20 million was available to local authorit
defaulties for DHP, this was increased to £30 million in 2011/2012 and £60 m illion in 2012/2013.  The 2013/14 allocation included an additional £30 million and £65 million to address the social rented sector size criteria and the benefit cap respectively, as wel
defaultl as £5 million to support the most sparsely populated areas. In 2014/15 The DHP pot available will be £125 million.
default&#xa0;defaultFigure 6: Discretionary Housing Payment funding (Great Britain) 2010-2015default&#xa0;
defaultClearly, local authorities have been given considerably more scope to address families housing needs on a local basis. The challenge is to ensure that this support gets to those families who need this most. 
default&#xa0;defaultRecommendation 3: The Department for Work and Pdefaultensions could do more to assist local authorities in advertising their schemes.default 
defaultThe gov.uk website should host links to all local DHP schemes in order to ensure that people looking to find out about their local scheme are able to find this online.default&#xa0;defaultLocal Adefaultuthorities should ensure that family information services are effectively communicating information about their local DHP scheme.default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultii. The introduction of local welfare assistance schemesdefaultFrom April 2013, crisis loans for living expenses and community 
defaultcare grants were abolished. Instead, funding was provided for local authority administered welfare assistance schemes.
defaultOur recent report 
defaultNowhere to turn
default 
defaultexamined the local emergency and community support now available through local welfare assistance sche
defaultmes. We found that the vast majority of the schemes are providing support for similar needs that were covered by crisis loans and community care grants. 
default&#xa0;
defaultA significant exception is that some schemes have stated that they will not be providing rent in adva
defaultnce. For example, Medway council states that their local welfare provision is scheme is “
defaultnot a rent deposit scheme or a rent in advance scheme
default” and Buckingham council’s
default scheme also states it does not provide this support.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are concerned that the areas 
defaultwhere local welfare schemes do not provide support for rent in advance, families will find it more difficult to access permanent housing and this could lead to increased homelessness. Research from Crisis found that 69% of housing advisors who work in priv
defaultate rented housing access schemes have used crisis loans to fund rent in advance. As one housing adviser who responded to the Crisis survey said: “
defaultCrisis loans are absolutely vital in enabling clients to source rent in advance
default”. 
default&#xa0;defaultRecommendation 4: Local wdefaultelfare assistance schemes should make provision for rent in advance.default&#xa0;
defaultOur 
defaultNowhere to turn 
defaultreport also found that the majority of local schemes had some form of residency or local connection entitlement criteria. Around half of schemes indicated that the 
defaultclaimant needed to be resident within the borough. In three stricter cases claimants had to have been resident for at least a year before they could apply for help.
default&#xa0;defaultFigure 7: Local welfare assistance eligibility – residency criteriadefault&#xa0;
defaultReforms to housing 
defaultbenefit in both the private and social rented sectors are likely to lead to more low income households moving home and area. Our concern is that families will not be eligible for support through local welfare assistance schemes if they have to move to area
defaults with strict residency criteria. Only a small number of local welfare assistance schemes allowed claimants to apply for assistance if they were moving into the area or if they had a local connection, such as family living there. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSome schemes had excepti
defaultons to residency criteria such as families fleeing domestic violence, care leavers housed outside the local area or homeless households, but this was not universal. 
default&#xa0;defaultRecommendation 5: Local authorities should not set extended periods of residency before defaulthouseholds can get access to local welfare assistance.default&#xa0;defaultRecommendation 6: Exemptions from residency crdefaultiteria should be established,default specifieddefault and transparently communicateddefault for all local welfare assistance schemes.default&#xa0;default4. Housing support in Universal Creditdefault&#xa0;
defaultSupport with housing costs is radically changing as a result of the introduction of Universal Credit. Help with housing costs is rolled into the provision of other support. This will mean that a significant additional cohort of middle income renting famili
defaultes will receive support with housing costs.
default&#xa0;
defaultFor example, a single parent family with two children and with eligible rent of £100 per week would stop being entitled to Housing Benefit when the parent earned £395 per week (£20500 per year) or more. Under Un
defaultiversal Credit, they will continue to be entitled to receive some help with their rental costs with an income of up to around £655 per week (£34000 per year).
default&#xa0;
defaultThe introduction of Universal Credit will raise a number of challenges made all the more importa
defaultnt as a result of the increased cohort of claimants receiving help with their housing costs. This section will consider three issues in particular: 
default&#xa0;defaulti. Variations in work allowances by levels of housing costdefault&#xa0;
defaultIt has always been intended that under Universal Credit, households would have different levels of work allowances depending on whether they have housing costs. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, initally, DWP stated there would be different levels of allowance for households wit
defaulth and without housing costs, with the level of "maximum" allowance reduced by 1.5 x the level of housing costs claimed, until it reached a "minimum" level.
default&#xa0;
defaultSo, for example, the "maximum" allowance for a lone parent with two children would be £8,800 per ye
defaultar, and the minimum would be £3,150.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, UC regulations now provide for only a maximum level of work allowance (for households without housing costs), and a minimum level (for those with housing costs). We are concerned this measure actually makes th
defaulte system considerably more complicated, since households with low levels of housing costs in receipt of UC would have to make a determination of whether they would be better off claiming for help with housing costs but receiving a reduced earnings disregar
defaultd, or making no claim for help with housing costs. For example:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultRecommendation 7: There should be a minimum and maximum level of disregard, with the maximum reduced by 1.5 x the rate of housing costs until they reach the minimum ddefaultisregard.default&#xa0;defaultii. Housing costs for owner-occupiersdefaultAs with the current system, Universal Credit makes some provision for help with housing costs for home owners. We are very concerned by the "zero earnings rule" to be introduced within the Support for 
defaultMortgage Interest (SMI) regulations which mean that SMI can only be applied where the household is undertaking no paid work
default.  This is considerably less generous than the current system where the attachment of SMI to out of work income replacement benefits
default means that households may receive support on working up to 16, or in some cases 24, hours per week.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe regulations note that for those attempting part-time work, the removal of SMI will "
defaultin part be compensated by the operation of the full disregard
default".  H
defaultowever, for households undertaking very small amounts of paid work this compensation will be extremely limited, or non-existent.
default&#xa0;
defaultMany parents attempt part time work to keep labour market skills up to date and as a route back into long term employment, for
default example, parents who are disabled and are considering making a move back into work.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis new rule risks creating great complexity in accepting money for any period of employment, and creates an enormous “cliff edge” of entitlement.  In the worst cases, c
defaultlaimants may find that they lose very significant amounts of money as a result of taking on a couple of hours of work, and as a result losing their SMI entitlement.
default&#xa0;defaultRecommendation 8: Households earning up to the level of their maximum earnings disregard sdefaulthould be entitled to receive SMI payments as part of their Universal Credit claimdefault.  default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultiii. Direct payment to tenantsdefault&#xa0;
defaultUnder Universal Credit, payments for housing costs will normally be paid directly to the tenant (rather than to the landlord). This will
default be a significant change for many households living in the social rented sector who currently have payments made to their landlord.
defaultThe government believes this will promote financial capability and independence. However, we are concerned that some familie
defaults with children may struggle to manage their rental payments.
default&#xa0;
defaultOne survey
default found that 86% of social tenants believe “strongly” that it is better for housing benefit to be paid direct to the landlord and 35% were not confident that they can keep up rental p
defaultayments if they receive their rent direct.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe direct payments demonstration project has been established in six areas across Britain. In May, 17% of the total claimants had had their payments switched back to their landlord
default.
defaultAdditionally, concerns have
default been raised in the project review that the outcomes achieved within the pilot areas required resource intensive interventions and may not be scalable following the roll out of Universal Credit
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe government do acknowledge that some households will req
defaultuire alternative payment arrangements (APAs) for payment of housing costs. The current guidance on the application of APAs specifies two tiers of problem which would indicate claimants that are “highly likely” and those that are “less likely” to require al
defaultternative payments
default.
default&#xa0;defaultRecommendation 9: Claimants with a history of rent arrears, those with current rent arrearsdefault, and families that have previously been homeless should be considered “highly likely” to require APAs for their housing costs.default&#xa0;defaultRecommendation 10: The Local Support Services Framework for Universal Credit needs to ensure that sufficient support is provided to enable resource-intensive interventions from local delivery partners, to identify families that may require housing paymentsdefault made direct to landlords.default&#xa0;default27 September 2013default&#xa0;

defaultWe have said that we are committed to making savings from this measure up to 2014-15. If it then becomes apparent that local allowance rates and rents are out of step, they can (during the debate this was later changed to “will”) be 
defaultreconsidered.”
default Following the introduction of Universal Credit, overall Universal Credit entitlement will be reduced since Housing Benefit will no longer exist as a separate entitlement.
