[normal]              
[normal]Passenger Focus is the official, independent consumer 
[normal]watchdog 
[normal]representing the interests of rail users 
[normal]throughout Great Britain 
[normal]and bus, coach and tram users 
[normal]across England
[normal],
[normal] outside 
[normal]London

[normal]Passenger Focus welcomes the opportunity to submit evidence to the Transport 
[normal]Committee’

[normal]              
[normal]Analysis 
[normal]of the National Passenger Survey
[normal] (NPS)
[normal] shows that b
[normal]y far the greatest 
[normal]‘
[normal]driver
[normal]’
[normal] of passengers’ overall satisfaction with a rail journey 
[normal]is whether the train is punctua
[normal]l.  At 
[normal]42% it dwarfs all other factors.  
[normal]The 
[normal]largest 
[normal]‘
[normal]driver
[normal]’
[normal] of overall dissatisfaction
[normal], 
[normal]however,
[normal] is how well a train company deal
[normal]s
[normal] with delays
[normal] – 
[normal]51%.
[normal]  This gives a good indication of passengers’ requirements during bouts of severe weather, which can be summarised as:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Minimising disruption in the first place[bold]2.2
[normal]              
[normal]In recent years th
[normal]ere have been a number of initiatives to ensure that the railway is less 
[normal]susceptible
[normal] to snow and ice than it has been in the past, some led by train operators and some by Network Rail.  
[normal]For 
[normal]example, m
[normal]odifications to prevent snow damaging electric traction motor
[normal]s and heating the third rail at key locations to prevent icing
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]              
[normal]It is impossible for Passenger Focus to judge w
[normal]hether what has been delivered so far
[normal] 
[normal]is sufficien
[normal]t.  However, 
[normal]it is 
[normal]worth noting that train performance
[normal] (as measured by the Public Performance Measure) 
[normal]in winter 2012/13 was worse than 2011/12 – 
[normal]although 
[normal]factors
[normal] other than the weather may have been involved.
[normal] 
[normal] We 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]support the Office of Rail Regulation’s requirement
[normal] for robust weather resilience proposals in Network Rail’s Control Period 5 (2014-19) Delivery Plan.

[normal]              
[normal]In terms of what more should be done, it would perhaps be helpful 
[normal]if
[normal], 
[normal]route by route
[normal], 
[normal]Network Rail and train companies 
[normal]were explicit 
[normal]about 
[normal]what further measures they 
[normal]could
[normal] take
[normal] to make the railway more resilient to severe weather 
[normal](i.e. over and above 
[normal]those already in
[normal]-
[normal]hand and 
[normal]required to achieve Control Period 5 2014-2019 
[normal]punctuality

[normal]s).  
[normal]T
[normal]hen the 
[normal]industry, stakeholders and government could consider w
[normal]hat further improvements would 
[normal]represent 
[normal]value for money.
[normal]  A similar approach could be used to identify w
[normal]hat more could be done to improve resilience 
[normal]to 
[normal]flooding, high winds, lightning str
[normal]ikes
[normal] and exceptionally high temperatures.

[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]NPS
[normal] 
[normal]question 
[normal]which
[normal] tracks opinion in this area asks passengers 
[normal]to 
[normal]rate the handling of delay
[normal].  The long-term trend shows improvement, 
[normal]albeit 
[normal]modest and 
[normal]starting from a low bas
[normal]e.  The proportion of passengers saying that their delay was handed “well” was 
[normal]38
[normal]% in the 
[normal]Spring
[normal] 2013 NPS.

[normal]6
[normal]              
[normal]Passenger Focus research
[normal] suggests that various factors 
[normal]contribute to how passengers rate the handling of disruption
[normal], including
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]7
[normal]              
[normal]I
[normal]nformation at times of disruption 
[normal]is heading 
[normal]slowly in the right direction
[normal].  Many more train companies now have ‘rainbow boards’ on their websites giving ‘at 
[normal]a glance’ status of the service
[normal]; p
[normal]assengers
[normal] following most train companies on Twitter 
[normal]receive 
[normal]marked
[normal]ly better information than in the past
[normal]; and it is now possible for pre-prepared ‘snow timetables’ to show through electronic journey planners the evening before
[normal].  
[normal]However, 
[normal]we continue to see inaccur
[normal]acies, inconsistencies and ambiguities at times of disruption, whether the cause 
[normal]is winter weather 
[normal]or not.
[normal]  A 
[normal]remaining 
[normal]weakness is the 
[normal]in
[normal]ability to give an accurate estimate of how long 
[normal]a disruption will last, 
[normal]even some hours into an incident, let alone 
[normal]an indication of how long knock
[normal]-
[normal]on delays will continue to affect journeys.

[normal]Information.[bold]  
[normal]After observations over winter 2012/13, Passenger Focus 
[normal]highlighted 
[normal]– via the 
[normal]rail industry’s 
[normal]National Taskforce – 
[normal]four areas of continuing weakness
[normal] in informati
[normal]on provision during disruption
[normal]:
[normal]as
[normal] necessary
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]9
[normal]              
[normal]Empathy and practical action.[bold]  
[normal]The tendency of train companies to
[normal] sometimes
[normal] give the impression 
[normal]t
[normal]hat they do not “treat me with respect
[normal] [as a paying customer]” is a particular problem at times of service disruptio
[normal]n, whether caused by 
[normal]winter 
[normal]weather 
[normal]or anything else.  
[normal]Passengers also get the impression that the 
[normal]rail 
[normal]industry can be slow with practical action
[normal] to minimise th
[normal]eir inconvenience
[normal].  
[normal]Passenger Focus continues to highlight specific areas that contribute to th
[normal]ese
[normal] impression
[normal]s
[normal], including:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]0
[normal]              
[normal]Welfare of passengers.[bold]  
[normal]Occasionally, 
[normal]the way 
[normal]disruption 
[normal]is handled g
[normal]ets close to the line between 
[normal]poor 
[normal]customer service and failure to safeguard the welfare of passengers.
[normal]  Incidents at Kings Cross on 19 February (200 passengers forced to ‘sleep’ overnight on a train in the station
[normal]; at Virginia Water on 9 May (passengers arrived home 
[normal]around midnight h
[normal]aving left Waterloo at 1720 
[normal]after a tree fell across the railway); and at 
[normal]Pewsey
[normal] on 4 August
[normal] (Penzance to Paddington train 
[normal]stuck for 5 hours).  
[normal]Incident reviews often find a culture of “don’t worry, this problem will sort itself out in half an hour”, with 
[normal]no
[normal] parallel
[normal] “but what
[normal] about the passengers 
[normal]if it doesn’t
[normal]?”  
[normal]Since the Kings Cross incident, Passenger Focus has written to all train companies about late-night service 
[normal]disruption,
[normal] and most have replied that their arrangements would have prevented a similar
[normal] incident.  
[normal]Nevertheless
[normal],
[normal] incidents keep 
[normal]happening
[normal] which, if they had coincided with extreme winter weather (or extreme heat)
[normal],
[normal] could have led to serious 
[normal]passenger 
[normal]welfare issues.
[normal]2.
[normal]11
[normal]              
[normal]Information needs – extreme weather.  [bold]Passengers’ information requirements during disruption caused by winter weather are largely the same as during any other disruption.  However, when snow has 
[normal]fallen
[normal] passengers have an extra requirement – because they have reason to suspect that trains 
[normal]may
[normal] b
[normal]e affected.  Train companies still have more to do to help passengers answer th
[normal]e
[normal] initial “can I get there?” question when 
[normal]they 
[normal]open their curtains to snow, or hear about it on the radio.  This is as much about reassurance that all 
[normal]is
[normal] 
[normal]well
[normal] as it
[normal] is about wa
[normal]rning of disruption.  For commuters, the question “and will I get home again
[normal]?
[normal]” will also be in their mind.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]1
[normal]2
[normal]              
[normal]‘snow [bold]timetables[bold]’[bold] – commuter networks[bold].[bold]  Passenger Focus is in principle persuaded by the argument 
[normal]that
[normal],
[normal] faced with a horrendous weather forecast
[normal] it is in 
[normal]passengers’ interests if commuter train 
[normal]companies 
[normal]run a timetable 
[normal]they are 
[normal]confident can be 
[normal]delivered 
[normal]despite the weather.
[normal]  Attempting to deliver the impossible and failing spectacularly does not help
[normal] anybody
[normal].  
[normal]With effective communications it should be possible 
[normal]for train companies 
[normal]to get the message to commuters that a ‘snow timetable’ will run tomorrow, with full details of what that means made available quickly
[normal].  However, ‘snow timetables’ must
[normal] 
[normal]stil
[normal]l 
[normal]meet the needs of passengers
[normal] – 
[normal]in
[normal] 
[normal]terms of continuing to run trains from all stations 
[normal]wherever p
[normal]ossible and providing 
[normal]enou
[normal]g
[normal]h coaches 
[normal]that 
[normal]pass
[normal]engers do not get left behind.  Passenger Focus felt that South West Trains did not 
[normal]quite 
[normal]get this right when th
[normal]ey implemented a ‘snow timetable’ in January 2013 and they have undertaken to review arrangements for the coming winter.
[normal]  
[normal]T
[normal]here is always 
[normal]the potential 
[normal]that the 
[normal]forecast snow does not materialise and 
[normal]passengers conclud
[normal]e 
[normal]that the train company has redu
[normal]ced t
[normal]he service unnecessarily.  To reduce th
[normal]at
[normal] risk, the time by which 
[normal]it 
[normal]must 
[normal]be 
[normal]decide
[normal]d
[normal] whether to run a ‘snow timetable’ the 
[normal]next 
[normal]day should be 
[normal]a
[normal]s late as possible, while still allowing the revised 
[normal]times 
[normal]to show 
[normal]in 
[normal]journey planning systems that evening.  The
[normal] industry should also enhance its capability to restore the normal timetable, or elements of 
[normal]it,
[normal] if it becomes clear the ‘snow timetable’ is not needed.
[normal]  
[normal]              
[normal]2.1
[normal]3
[normal]              
[normal]‘snow timetables’ – long-distance operators.[bold]  In contrast, Passenger Focus supports the position taken by some long-distance operators, e.g. 
[normal]CrossCountry
[normal] and Virgin Trains,
[normal] 
[normal]that the fu
[normal]ll timetable 
[normal]should be maintained 
[normal]wherever possible.  Infrequent, long-distance passengers are m
[normal]ore difficult to war
[normal]n 
[normal]that a different timetable will be in operation
[normal], and 
[normal]retiming the 11
[normal]:
[normal]00 to 11
[normal]:
[normal]08
[normal], for example,
[normal] would cause considerable confusion – not least to those whose ticket is for the 11
[normal]:
[normal]00 and no other train.  
[normal]Re-writing the timetable with fewer trai
[normal]ns taking lo
[normal]nger than normal also risks the (reasonable) accusation that it has been done not in passengers’ interests
[normal],
[normal] but purely to boost punctuality statistics.

[normal]              
[normal]While b
[normal]us passengers would
[normal] 
[normal]clearly 
[normal]rather there is 
[normal]no disruption in the first place
[normal], they recognise that bus services will inevitably be impacted when significant snow 
[normal]and/or 
[normal]ice affects the road network.  Nevertheless, bus passengers do expect that reasonable steps 
[normal]will be 
[normal]taken to ensure that buses conti
[normal]nue to run
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]and as reliably as 
[normal]possible, 
[normal]wherever
[normal] it is safe to do so.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. 3
[normal]              
[normal]Passenger Focus published research 
[normal]earlier in 
[normal]2013 
[normal]looking at 
[normal]bus passengers’ experiences of delays and service disruption
[normal].  Although covering experiences 
[normal]of delays 
[normal]resulting from many different causes, i.e. not just severe winter weather, 
[normal]a number of 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]findings 
[normal]and recommendations 
[normal]are relevant to this 
[normal]Inquiry
[normal].  The research found that improvements in two key areas would 
[normal]change
[normal] passengers’ experiences during disruption 
[normal]– information and driver attitude.  Passengers spoke about feeling 
[normal]‘
[normal]powerless
[normal]’
[normal] standin
[normal]g at a bus stop not knowing if a bus will come – as one 
[normal]research respondent 
[normal]put it “it’s mental torture sometimes at bus stops working out whether to stay or whether to go”.  Passengers also said they wanted bus drivers to 
[normal]behave more as the bus company’s 
[normal]customer service representative, providing information, showing empathy and expressing regret.  
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]              
[normal]Passenger Focus’s recommendations in the light of this research include:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. 
[normal]5
[normal]              
[normal]If
[normal] there is disruption 
[normal]to bus services 
[normal]caused by severe 
[normal]winter 
[normal]weather, good in
[normal]formation is key to minimising the impact on passengers.  
[normal]I
[normal]nformation 
[normal]that allows passengers to m
[normal]ake an informed decision – be it 
[normal]to 
[normal]set out earlier, 
[normal]not 
[normal]attempt to travel, find a different way to get there – 
[normal]should b
[normal]e a key 
[normal]objective 
[normal]for 
[normal]bus companies and
[normal]/or local authorities.
[normal]  Providing assurance that buses 
[normal]are
[normal] running, if potentially with delays, is important as well: when it has snowed passengers have reason to doubt it.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1
[normal]              
[normal]Rail.  
[normal]The NPS shows that for rail passengers the way disruption is managed is moving slowly in the right direction, but there 
[normal]remains 
[normal]a considerable way to go.
[normal]  It is important to ask what more could be done to improve the railway’s resilience to snow and ice.  
[normal]When 
[normal]disruption 
[normal]occurs
[normal] 
[normal]information that allows passengers to make an informed choice about what they do is vital.  D
[normal]u
[normal]ring 
[normal]winter 2012/13 
[normal]passenger information 
[normal]was better, but it was 
[normal]far from 
[normal]perf
[normal]ect
[normal] and t
[normal]his 
[normal]paper 
[normal]mentions a number of areas in which furthe
[normal]r improvement is needed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]              
[normal]Bus.  When bus services are disrupted, for any reason, passengers’ key requirement is for information about what is going on – and yet many feel
[normal] 
[normal]there is no effective means to find 
[normal]that 
[normal]out
[normal].  How would a passenger working in their office find out that a bus company had decided it would suspend operations at 16:00 
[normal]because heavy snow is 
[normal]forecast?   In some cases 
[normal]it
[normal] is true
[normal]:
[normal] without a system tracking the location of buses in 
[normal]real-time
[normal], there is
[normal] no means to find out exactly what is happening – but in other
[normal]s 
[normal]Apps 
[normal]exist, 
[normal]but few passengers appear to know about them.  A quick win for the bus industry would be to raise awareness about Apps and other sources of information where reliable 
[normal]real-time
[normal] sys
[normal]tems are in place.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3
[normal]              
[normal]How public transport operators manage service disruption, including that caused by severe winter weather remains an important area 
[normal]of work 
[normal]for Passenger Focus.  If snow and ice causes disruption this winter we will monitor how well 
[normal]train and bus companies cope, including in the vital area of passenger information.
