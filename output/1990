[normal]The Northern Ireland Affairs Committee’s inquiry into the banking structure in Northern Ireland[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The BBA is the leading trade association for the UK banking and financial services sector. We speak for over 200 member banks from 60 countries on the full range of UK and international banking issues. 
[normal]Through 
[normal]our 
[normal]Northern Ireland Advisory Panel, the BBA m
[normal]aintains
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]regular
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]contact with the Northern Ireland Executive
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]and local industry bodies, over and ab
[normal]ove the on-going activity
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]of our
[normal] individual members. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We are pleased to have this opportunity to respond to The Northern Ireland Affairs Committee’s inquiry
[normal] into the banking structure in Northern Ireland.
[normal] Whilst it is not suitable for the BBA
[normal] to comment on the actions of individual members, we are able to provide some broader commentary around the banking sector in Northern Ireland, which we believe will be o
[normal]f assistance to the Committee.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Specifically, the evidence in Annex 1 include
[normal]s
[normal] detail on the following areas:

[normal]The BBA's
[normal] Business Finance 
[normal]Taskforce
[normal] is
[normal] funded by
[normal] 
[normal]the major banks and now operating under the 
[normal]“Better Business Finance
[normal] brand
[normal]” commissioned the 
[normal]research 
[normal]company BDRC-continental to conduct independent research of SMEs across the UK.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The survey provides a robust and respected independent source of informati
[normal]on on the demand for, and availability of, finance for SMEs in the UK
[normal] and the research is overseen by an independent steering committee
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The data below is from the Northern Ireland chapter taken from the 
[normal]second year of annual findings from the 
[normal]SME Finance Monitor (SMEF).
[normal]The results for Northern Ireland are based on 751 interviews (250 per quarter) in Q4 2011, to a profile by size and sector weighted to BIS profile data. 
[normal]This data provides insight into 
[normal]businesses experience as regards finance access in Northern Ireland and serves as a very useful barometer of actual business views.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The data
[normal] covers:
[normal] 
[normal]SME Demographics
[normal], actual borrowing events 1
[normal]2 months
[normal] prior to the survey, expected borrowing events in the
[normal] 
[normal]next 3 months
[normal], demand for future finance and r
[normal]easons for not
[normal] applying for
[normal] borrowing
[normal]. 
[normal]The results are weighted to 136,000 SMEs. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]SME Demographics[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]SMEs in Northern Ireland are very similar demographically to SMEs overall
[normal]; notably half of all SMEs in NI 
[normal]currently use external finance
[normal] and 72% of SMEs in NI have 0 employees, compared to 74% in UK).

[normal]SECTION 3[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The Business Finance initiatives [bold]in [bold]Northern Ireland[bold] [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Better Business Finance[bold]Better Business Finance (BBF) provides impartial information and support to business customers looking to raise finance. The BBF
[normal] is supported by the BBA in conjunction with some of our members and has been created to bring to life the recommendations of the
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Business 
[normal]Finance Taskforce
[normal]. The BBF has three core themes at its heart: improving customer relationships; improving access to finance;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]as well as
[normal] improving information and transparency. It
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]includes supporting businesses through 
[normal]mentoring; 
[normal]the introduction of an 
[normal]independently monitored appeals process for finance applications and providing guidance to UK businesses on how to export abroad or pitch to a bank when seeking finance. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The BBF and its initiatives are gaining good traction with businesses generally but 
[normal]we acknowledge awareness of the mentoring and appeals support in Northern Ireland, as well as the support tools available for businesses such as mentorsme.co.uk, betterbusinessfinance.co.uk and businessfinanceforyou.co.uk, are not as extensive as we would 
[normal]have hoped. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To this end, we are working with the banks and the Northern Ireland Chambers of Commerce upon how we can further invigorate the mentoring scheme and with Professor Russel Griggs, with the CBI, and more generally the Ulster Business School, up
[normal]on how the appeals process and support tools are more widely known. Further detail
[normal]s
[normal] are 
[normal]outlined below
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Awareness Raising[bold]One of the key matters that the SME Finance Monitor 
[normal](SMEFf) 
[normal]highlights is the 
[normal]‘i
[normal]ndirect discouragement
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal]of
[normal] 
[normal]a 
[normal]business to 
[normal]approach its bank 
[normal]to discuss 
[normal]its
[normal] finance need
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]It 
[normal]i
[normal]s important that all parties
[normal]:
[normal] banks; business groups; government
[normal],
[normal] work together in 
[normal]building
[normal] confidence and 
[normal]promoting 
[normal]the support that is available to businesses. To this end the BBA is working with the N
[normal]o
[normal]rthern Ireland banks 
[normal]and business groups on  a series 
[normal]of
[normal] activities to raise awareness through, inter alia:  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Alongside the Better Business Finance Initiatives, the banks continue to work hard upon the deployment of the national UK Enterprise Finance Guarantee
[normal] (EFG) Scheme and Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS).  Both of these Schemes are positive initiatives seeking to support business, with EF
[normal]G
[normal] targeted at helping businesses with a lack of security and FLS seeking to ensure credit is more affordable for custome
[normal]rs. These schemes have had positive impact 
[normal]in Northern Ireland 
[normal]and the banks will continue to work closely with policy makers to ensure their optimal structure for the local Northern Ireland market. Progress of the schemes of course also depends on levels 
[normal]of credit demand which remain subdued.   
[normal]In addition
[normal],
[normal] the BBA with the major banks continues to review ways in which the banking industry can support and develop alternative finance options for business. This includes the establishment of the £2.5bn 
[normal]Busin[bold]ess Growth Fund[bold] 
[normal]in 2011 
[normal]which 
[normal]was
[normal] set up 
[normal]by the major UK banks as part of the commitments made under the Business Finance Taskforce to provide long term patient capital for growing SMEs. Now operating out of 
[normal]7
[normal] 
[normal]locations the BGF has invested
[normal] in the UK
[normal] over GBP 
[normal]150
[normal]m in growing businesses. The BGF 
[normal]continues to work
[normal] 
[normal]with business groups and banks in Northern Ireland, as regards 
[normal]to 
[normal]opportunities there
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The 
[normal]BBA is pleased
[normal] 
[normal]to see
[normal] the number of initiatives, presentations and meetings taking place to help buil
[normal]d a 
[normal]pipeline in Northern Ireland
[normal] across
[normal] 
[normal]a range of sectors
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The BBA has also recently entered into a strategic partnership with the UK Business Angels Association to help business gain greater understanding of the benefits and options from angel investors 
[normal]and is currently working on the rollout of a referral programme, whereby in instances where bank finance is not appropriate
[normal],
[normal] the business has the option to be referred by the bank to a local community development finance provider. 
[normal]L
[normal]ater this year
[normal] the BBA w
[normal]ill
[normal] be assessing how such a programme can be expanded to Northern Ireland
[normal].
[normal]    
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]SECTION 4[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Detailed regional lending data[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The BBA provides quarterly aggregated lending statistics, in confidence, to the Department for Finance and Personnel (DFP) 
[normal]and the Economic Advisory Group (EAG) to aid understanding of credit distribution
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]in the local SME market.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We also supply quarterly aggregated agricultural data to help the Northern Ireland Executive establish a
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]better understanding
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]of income factors affec
[normal]ting farmers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The BBA is also working with the banks and Northern Ireland government upon how this data may be expanded. In addition, as highlighted above, the major banks fund the independent work BDRC Continental undertake 
[normal]to assess
[normal] businesses experience
[normal] with finance.

[normal]SECTION 5[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Branch closure and access to banking in rural communities[bold]BBA members recognise their responsibility in providing a network of services for their customers. Individual firms continue to view a branch 
[normal]footprint as an integral part of their service to customers and continue to compete against each other on the strength of this offering.
[normal] 
[normal]In common with most commercial businesses, banks make
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]their decisions in respect of both provision and withdrawal of b
[normal]ranches based upon demand and profitability. Branches will remain open if they are being used, but if the number of customers coming into the branch falls, then just like any other retail outlet, the bank will need to look carefully at whether it is still 
[normal]viable to keep it open
[normal]. 
[normal]Nevertheless a number of banks have committed to keep a branch open if there are no alternative banks in the vicinity. The increasing availability of cash services through ATMs, Post Offices
[normal] (c11,000 branches in the United Kingdom)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]and cash back via retail outlets has greatly reduced the demand for counter access in recent years.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Direct Debits and Standing Orders have also reduced the need for over the counter bill payments.
[normal]The ways in which customers are demanding their banks pro
[normal]vide services are evolving in new ways and at a tremendous speed that could not have been envisaged even 5 years ago. Offerings such as: location based services, online banking, mobile payments, faster payments and faster account switching only begin to sc
[normal]ratch the surface of recent developments. These services are flexible, convenient and usually provide 24 hours, 7 days a week banking service. 
[normal]T
[normal]he telephone banking network has been well established for many years providing an ea
[normal]sy to use service for custo
[normal]mers;
[normal] 
[normal]a
[normal]s such many personal customers now do not need to go into a bank branch and call centres are able to deal with many other aspects of personal banking. Some banks are also trying to find more cost efficient and effective ways for small businesses to bank ca
[normal]sh rather than queue up at the branch. They understand that this is a problem for small business customers and there are already systems in place for cheques. 
[normal]One recent development of interest has been from the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), whose remit i
[normal]s to 
[normal]make markets work well by promoting and protecting consumer interests throughout the U
[normal]nited 
[normal]K
[normal]ingdom
[normal]. The OFT
[normal]’s paper “Price and choice in remote communities,” published in June 2012, reports
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]on the issues faced by remote communities
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]with views receive
[normal]d from over 500 public bodies, companies and voluntary organisations. 
[normal]The report identifies a range of complimentary actions that businesses, including the banking sector, can take. The suggested solution for banks was to provide services to remote communi
[normal]ties through alternative delivery mechanisms; this included an example of mobile banking facilities where a bricks-and-mortar bank may not be available to local residents and businesses.
