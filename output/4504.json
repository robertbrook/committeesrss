"&#xa0;\n              \nDIS 44&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted from Quality of Life Association&#xa0;&#xa0;1.1 Quality of Life \n(QLA) \nwas the first Lao Civil \nS\nociety \nO\nrganisation to provide assistance and support to \nunexploded ordinance (\nUXO\n)\n survivors in Lao PDR as well as to people with disabilities. In its daily activities, QLA sees the barriers \nthat people with disabilities (\nPWD\n)\n, including survivors, are facing\n,\n and tries \nto \n break them down to empower PWD and develop opportunities for them to participate \nfully in \nsociety\n, to contribute \nto the development of their countries\n,\n and \nto \nadvocate for their rights . \n&#xa0;\n1.2 From QLA experience this can only be achieved if PWD benefit from mainstream and disability specific services as reflected by the twin track approach\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.3 PWD, including survivors, are people with a lot of capabilities\n,\n and not acknowledging \nthis\n would be detrimental to any development efforts. They should thus, directly or via their representative associations, be given \nthe \nopportunity to participate actively \nin \n the definition of policies and programs, \nand in \n their implementation and monitoring\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.4 Development program\ns\n and policies should reflect those considerations so \nas \nto be inclusive of and accessible to PWD, including survivors, from the very moment they are drafted to the moment they are implemented and assessed. Only then\n will\n development efforts  reach the most vulnerable and \nwill \nPWD  benefit from them on an equal basis to other\ns,\n thus making sure no one is left behind.\n&#xa0;2. Introduction of the work of Quality of Life Association&#xa0;\n2.1 To answer the need\ns\n of unexploded ordnance  victims, and people with disabilities  the Quality of Life Association  \nwas \n set up in 2011 and became the first Lao Civil Society Organisation  providing assistance and support services to victims of unexploded ordnance , people with disabilities  and poor families in the Xieng Khouang Province in Lao PDR.  The QLA Operational Team and Board of Directors are made up of Lao nationals, some of whom are UXO survivors. The objective to \nset up the association in Xieng Khuang province because it is one of the most bomb affected areas in Laos. “Xieng Khuang, know for the Plain of Jars, is also the plain of scars.”\n&#xa0;\n2.2 The presence of the buried bombs affects the quality of life of local people in many ways. Economic development is stalled. Children need to learn at an early age that they must be careful around their homes and villages. Agriculture is more difficult and often dangerous. Many people who have survived an accident need expensive medical care and follow-up treatment; families who have lost a loved one also need economic support and new livelihoods.             \n2.3 The QLA supports UXO affected communities and PWD through training on animal raising, weaving and dyeing, and the production of hand-crafted souvenirs. Another important aspect is emergency and long term medical care, including rehabilitation, as well as psycho-social support.\n  \nThe QLA has run training courses for UXO accident survivors, family members of UXO victims and PWD in nine villages of the province\n. The Association\n  targeted \nthese villages \n for assistance after it conducted a survey among local communities.\n“We select 15 people representing 15 families in a village to attend a course. We firstly give priority to a UXO affected family member and UXO survivors and persons with disability because they are our target groups. Our second priority is poor families. After attending a training course on livestock or poultry raising, each person is given 600,000-700,000 kip to use as capital to undertake this activity. Those who attend a training course on weaving, making handicrafts or tailoring can sell their products at the QLA village shop.” \n   \nThe association provides all the materials needed for trainees to make the products and pays them for each item in accordance with their ability and the orders placed by the QLA. A training course on tailoring has taught women how to sew small fabric bags to contain laptops and mobile phones.\n \nThe association will continue to help UXO affected communities and PWD in all districts of the province because a large number of people need assistance and have no permanent job\n \nto provide them with a regular source of income.                                                                      \n&#xa0;\n2.4 \nThe Lao Government ratified the UNCRPD on 2\n5\n September, 2009.\n After the ratification, the National Committee for  Disabled People (NCDP) and the Lao Disabled People’s Association (LDPA) ha\nve\n collaborated with other related Ministries by \ni\ndentify\ning\n \nseven\n Government officials as disability rights officers in \nseven\n targeted ministries\n: \n \nthe \nMinistry of Labour and Social Welfare, \nthe \nM\ninistry \no\nf \nE\nducation\n, \nthe \nM\ninistry \no\nf \nF\ninance\n, \nthe \nM\ninistry \no\nf \nH\nealth\n, \nthe \nM\ninistry \no\nf \nP\nublic Work and Transportation\n, \nthe \nM\ninistry \no\nf \nI\nnformation and \nC\nulture\n, \nthe \nM\ninistry \no\nf \nJ\nustice. They\n then train\ned\n selected government Ministries to formulate and implement Ministerial action plans to support the inclusion and development of persons with disabilities in the Lao PDR. \nThe Lao Disability Decree is issued in order to determine principles, rules and measures \n to be\n taken for the protection of rights and interes\nts of persons with disabilities;\n to formulate policies on treatment, health rehabilitation, vocational training, employment promotion and other policies aiming at promoting self-development and self-reliance \n for persons with disabilities;\n  \nand \nto eliminate all forms of discrimination against persons with disabilities, in order to create \nthe \nconditions for persons with disabilities to participate fully and on \nan \nequal basis in social activities. \nHowever, \nthe Lao Disability Decree is not yet finalized by the Lao Government.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n5\n Nevertheless, as of today in Lao PDR, PWD including survivors, are facing barriers to access basic services such as health, education and employment on \nan \nequal basis \nto \n their peers. This lack of access to basic services leads to reduced opportunities to contribute to the economic, social and cultural life of their families and communities. The result is that PWD may not participate fully \nin \n social and community development and face additional \ndifficulties to elevate their social and economic situation. So, the QLA is encouraging PWD, including survivors, in Xieng Khouang Province to participate in family and community life and contribute to  local development. However, when basic services are developed that are not accessible for UXO survivors and persons with disabilities, the challenges are often too difficult to overcome.  \n&#xa0;\n3. Reason for submitting evidence:&#xa0;\n3.1 Given the fact that QLA is a pioneer in this field in Lao PDR, it was of outmost importance for us to share our views. Besides, Lao PDR being the most affected country in terms of cluster munitions contamination, this was also an opportunity for us to call\n for \n synergies to be made between victim assistance and the broader disability and development frameworks\n -\n to make sure that there exist specific policies for survivors, especially thanks to victim assistance provisions in the Oslo and the Ottawa treaties\n;\n but also \nto make sure \nthat PWD, and thus including survivors, can benefit from the efforts that are made for the development of a country or of a region. Indeed, achieving our goals in term of development is illusory if PWD, including survivors and other vulnerable persons are left behind\n,\n as  has been recalled recently at the highest level with the report of the High \nL\nevel \nP\nanel\n, \n th\nat\n  of the UN Secretary General\n;\n and  the discussions around the post 2015 agenda.\n&#xa0;\n3.2 \nThe Lao PDR is a least developed country experiencing poverty. The country is ranked 133 out of 177 nations in the Global Development index. Approximately 23% of the population lives on less than $1USD per day. Persons with disabilities are particularly vulnerable to poverty  in society. The Lao National Growth and Poverty Eradication Scheme (2003) reported physical and mentally handicapped/blind groups represent the highest percentage (18.5%) of people  at-risk of poverty in Vientiane Municipality. Lack of awareness and understanding by government policy makers and officials lead\ns\n to exclusion of persons with disability from development programs\n \nD\nue to cluster munitions and other UXO \nthere were \nat least 50\n,\n525 mi\nne/\nERW\n casualties, including 29,506 people killed and 21,\n019 injured since 1964\n. Knowing those figures, it is obvious any initiative taken now\n,\n to \ncreate \n a society which is inclusive of PWD and where a broad range of services are accessible to all\n,\n will benefit  future generations and will have long lasting effects for themselves but also for their communities since they are, on \nan \nequal basis to others, actors of change.\n&#xa0;\n3.3 Besides, I am myself a person with disability and I have met the barriers I am trying, as the executive director of QLA, to break. I was lucky to find support and to be able to continue my education and then get a job as it is sadly not the case for all PWD, including survivors who remain the poorest amongst the poor because they often do not have access to such services and opportunities. For instance in my own province there is right now only one Rehabilitation centre in Xiengkhouang city which provide\ns\n such services like rehabilitation, prosthetic and orthotic to survivors and PWD by the CMR and COPE. It is far from most villages where survivors and PWD live and therefore very difficult to access it. For instance my friendwas injured in the \n1970s \n when she was sixteen. And she finally received \nher prosthesis on 4\nth\n April 2010 with the support of Handicap International and COPE. I would wish \nthat \nall survivors and PWD \nquickly \naccess quickly \nthe \nsupports we need\n,\n because it means we can survive as human being. I am also part of a survivor initiative called the Lao Ban Advocates and this experience, thanks to a close collaboration with the Lao Government, including with the NRA, has proved to be efficient. We have been working hand in hand with various stakeholders to raise the voice of survivors and their affected communities\n,\n and to help the government in elaborating a framework for addressing their needs. Such \nan \nexample demonstrates that the motto “Nothing about us without us” is a meaningful one and that joint efforts lead to great results.\n&#xa0;4. Quality of Life recommendations&#xa0;So, to ensure that people with di\nsabilities including UXO survivors are included in development wok, here are a few recommendations that QLA would like to share:\n&#xa0;\n4.1 Policy and programme development sh\nould\n be inspired by lived experiences and therefore\n PWD, including UXO survivors, shall be given the possibility to  participate actively in the discussions and contribute fully to the elaboration of those policies and programs. Indeed UXO survivors and PWD are often left behind, so to ensure an inclusive development, UXO survivors and PWD we should be included in the first planning, discussing and decision making processes related to development framework\ns\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n Disabled Peoples Organizations (DPOs) should play a prominent role in the implementation of policies and programs, and need to be supported \ni\nn order to be able to take the lead in implementing, \nmonitoring and evaluati\nng \n development policies and programs for PWD \nand UXO survivor\ns\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.3\n A twin track approach should be reflected: On \nthe \none hand\n so\n as to ensure that the approach taken, when developing systems, strategies and projects for the general public, is inclusive of PWD, including survivors, be\n it\n in areas like health care services, employment programs, education programs, etc. On the other  specific measures\n,\n sh\nould \n also be taken to support the development and the empowerment of PWD, including survivors. \n&#xa0;\n4.4\n All mainstream services  should  also be designed as to be fully accessible to PWD. Many PWD and survivors are unable to access public buildings\n and\n health care services because th\ne\nse are not accessible. Sometimes, they will not benefit from available services in their communities due to problems \nof \n transportation or the fact they did not get access to information related to such services.\n&#xa0;\n4.5 Along with other factors such as gender and age, policy and program development should make sure that\n data are also disaggregated by disability to ensure PWD, including survivors, benefit from \nprograms \non an equal basis with others. \nThis \n will also help \nin \nmeasuring the impact of those efforts made to tackle poverty and improve people’s li\nves\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.6 Any step taken also implies action to \nsupport and strengthen Disabled Peoples Organizations (DPOs) so they can advocate for the rights of PWD and thus collaborate \nin \n the elaboration of policies that affect them with all the relevant stakeholders.\n              \n&#xa0;\n3 December 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
