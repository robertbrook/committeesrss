&#xa0;[bold]WWC002[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Written evidence submitted by [bold]Diane [bold]Reay[bold], Professor of Education[bold] [bold]University of Cambridge[bold]&#xa0;[bold]This report is primarily ba
[normal]sed on my 
[normal]findings from 8 funded 
[normal]research projects spanning the last 15 years
[normal],
[normal] but it is also grounded in my personal exp
[normal]erience of social mobility as a person 
[normal]who has moved
[normal],
[normal] from a coal mining community
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]into
[normal] 
[normal]the upper echelons of academia 
[normal]via nineteen years  of teaching in working class schools. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Summary points: [bold]&#xa0;[bold]              
[normal]We cannot make sense of contemporary
[normal] white
[normal] working class underachievement 
[normal]without investigating its historical roots
[normal]. 
[normal]              
[normal]Working class underachievement is not just about the attitudes and beha
[normal]viour of the working classes b
[normal]ut also the attitudes 
[normal]and behaviour 
[normal]of the upper and middle classes and the relationships between all three classes
[normal] – ‘no class is an island’
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]Schools reflect wider society’s attitudes and values
[normal] rather than being able to compensate for them
[normal]. An effec
[normal]tive policy for tackling white 
[normal]working class underachievement would have to address economic and social 
[normal] 
[normal]conditions as well as focusing on the educational system. 
[normal]Current policies have increased segregation and polarisation
[normal], 
[normal]both within schools and between them
[normal]. [bold]Social distance between social classes has grown
[normal] in schools, mirroring the growing social distance in wider society. 
[normal] [bold]As the 
[normal]white working classes are increasingly devalued and 
[normal]residualised
[normal] within the educational system their learner ide
[normal]ntities have become more
[normal] fragile and 
[normal]unconfident. 
[normal]W
[normal]e need a
[normal]n educational sy
[normal]stem that accords respect to
[normal] the white workin
[normal]g classes; a system that attributes
[normal] po
[normal]sitive value to
[normal] 
[normal]worki
[normal]ngclassness
[normal]. 
[normal]A range of  s
[normal]trategies focused on curriculum and 
[normal] school level 
[normal]are listed. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.   
[normal]The prevalent commonsense view 
[normal]is either 
[normal]that the white working classes are to blame for their 
[normal]relative 
[normal]underachievement, that it is about cultural deficits, lack of ambition,  and the wrong sorts of attitudes
[normal], 
[normal] 
[normal]or 
[normal]that cer
[normal]tain schools and their staff are failing the working classes. But white working class educational underachievement is far more complex than either the cultural deficit analysis or failing school thesis allows. 
[normal]First, w
[normal]e need  an historical perspective in o
[normal]rder  to understand why schooling has not worked for the working classes
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A brief history of [bold]white [bold]working class underachievement [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.  
[normal]The growing middle-class commitment to worki
[normal]ng-class education in the late 
[normal]eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries w
[normal]as totally different from their ideals for middle-
[normal]class education but was  rather a means  of ensuring that the lower classes  would acquiesce in middle class aspirations
[normal].
[normal] Adam Smith 
[normal]epitomised
[normal] this English bourgeois viewpoint regarding working class educa
[normal]tion in 
[normal]The Wealth of Nations
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]An instructed and intelligent people besides are always more
[normal]decent and orderly than an ignorant one ... less apt to be misled
[normal]into any wanton or unnecessary opposition to the measures of the
[normal]government. (Smith, 1785, p. 
[normal]305)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]For Smith, as well as for the vast majority of the  political  and intellectual elite at the time, the schooling of the working classes was always to be subordinate and inferior to that of the middle classes, designed to contain and pacify rather 
[normal]than to educate and liberate.
[normal]When  state education for all was introduced 
[normal] a hundred years after the publication of 
[normal]The Wealth of 
[normal]Nations  
[normal]the provision of education for working-class children was thought of by and large instrumentally, rather than as lik
[normal]ely to contribute to the life possibilit
[normal]ies of the children themselves. T
[normal]he intention of the dominant classes was still to police and control the working classes ra
[normal]ther than to educate them. A
[normal]ny n
[normal]otion of education as a means of working class educational s
[normal]uccess 
[normal] has always been tempered by the ruling elites’ instrumental view of education as a form of control of the white working classes. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.   
[normal]So d
[normal]enial of working class value within schooling has a long and damaging history dating from the inception of s
[normal]tate schooling for all. This makes the white working class experience of education qualitatively and quantitatively different from that of their BME counterparts. The white working classes bring to their experience of schooling a collective memory of educa
[normal]tional subordination and marginalization that is less the case for BME groups
[normal]. 
[normal]Children negotiate schooling not only directly through their own experiences but also through the 
[normal]sedimented
[normal] experiences of parents and even grandparents. 
[normal]W
[normal]hite working class fa
[normal]milies  expectations of social mobility through education are often minimal, conditioned by their own experiences over several generations. Both the historical legacy, and how it is played out in the present, are different for many BME working class groups
[normal]. Some of these bring histories of educational achievement in their countries of origin. Others, despite a lack of educational credentials, bring a strong conviction that a fresh start in the British educational system will provide crucial opportunities  f
[normal]or their children’s advancement that were denied to them.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Class is relational and results in a [bold] contemporary educational culture of winners and losers[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.   
[normal]The 
[normal] historical legacy of being  the inferior ‘other’ within education resonates in the present. The same two barriers that were present at the inception of state schooling still exist. The working classes continue to have access to relatively low levels of th
[normal]e kind of material, cultural and psychological resources
[normal] that a
[normal]id educational success.  First, most  cannot
[normal] afford the private tuition and the enriching cultural activities that many middle class parents invest in for their children. Nor do they have the s
[normal]ame degree of confidence and sense of entitlement that the middle classes possess  in their interactions with schooling. 
[normal]Second, 
[normal]the negative representations that 
[normal]characterised
[normal] the past  continue in
[normal] the prese
[normal]nt. N
[normal]ow we have skivers and 
[normal]chavs
[normal]  rather than s
[normal]cum  and dross  but the same processes of class 
[normal]othering
[normal] are still at work.  And just as class is relational  in that we cannot fully understand working class 
[normal] attitudes and 
[normal]behaviou
[normal]r
[normal]  without  contextualizing them in relation to middl
[normal]e class attitudes and
[normal] 
[normal]behavi
[normal]our
[normal] so 
[normal]educational success and failure is relational. Those who succeed do so at the expense of others’ failure. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.   
[normal]We may have become ‘an 
[normal]aspirational
[normal] nation’ but we are not a socially mobile one; desires and aspirations cannot compensate for l
[normal]ack of 
[normal]family 
[normal]resources. 
[normal]And as Wilkinson and Pickett point out, educational failure becomes more prevalent as
[normal] societies become more unequal.
[normal] The irony is that the rhetoric of social mobility 
[normal]within 
[normal]education has increased in volume and intensity as 
[normal] it has 
[normal]become less and less possible in practice. We cannot all succeed academically. If we did what counts now as educational success would lose its value. Numerous studies indicate that one of the key lessons middle class children learn is that failure 
[normal]is intolerable, unwanted and belong
[normal]s somewhere else. We see this in the ESRC project I conducted on white middle class parents sending their children to state comprehensives: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I had everything that the working class kids didn't have.  You know everything 
[normal]that my mum and dad had given me and I was more intelligent than they were and there was more going for me than there was for them
[normal]….b
[normal]eing friends with these people made me feel like the one you know who was achieving you know and was superior to them. (Cam
[normal]illa
[normal],  year 
[normal]13 student, 
[normal]white middle class
[normal]).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.   
[normal]Evident also is a sense of intrinsic superiority that was even more potent in the 
[normal] words of the 
[normal]privately educated students I interviewed for a further ESRC project on HE choice: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]I just expected to go t
[normal]o a good university. I knew I was a lot more intelligent 
[normal]              
[normal]and cultured 
[normal]than ordinary kids. (Will, private school student)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Importance of wider social and economic conditions[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]7.   
[normal]Education reflects wider social and economic conditions. We are at a point 
[normal]in time when the power of the working classes economically and socially is diminishing while the power of the elites has increased
[normal], 
[normal] and the middle classes are struggling to maintain their position in  society. There is also a troubling growth in the social distance between the classes. When I was growing up as a working class child in the 50s and 60s, my educational success rested par
[normal]tly on the empathy and kindness of the parents of my middle class classmates who invited me to complete my homework in houses with space and places to concentrate. Today, the middle class parents I interviewed talk of  mistrust and even fear of the white w
[normal]orking classes: 
[normal]              
[normal]He doesn’t bring these children home but at least he knows where they come from
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]I have to admit a great fear was that my son would get in with the scrap metal dealer’s son. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I get anxious at the thought of the girls from the council
[normal] estate coming round because we have so much and they have so little, there is always a nagging fear they might take something. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]A judgmental system: [bold]The impact of educational policies [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]8.   
[normal]There is not the space to discuss the impact of the many polic
[normal]ies introduced over th
[normal]e last 3 decades but  I will use two examples, 
[normal] the contemporary assessment and testing regime 
[normal]and the  growth of setting and streaming in schools to show how 
[normal]large numbers of working class children 
[normal]are 
[normal]see
[normal] to be of 
[normal]low value
[normal] 
[normal]in our c
[normal]urrent educational system
[normal]. 
[normal]W
[normal]hile the 
[normal]stated aim is to raise the achievement of all children, one consequen
[normal]ce of the increased testing
[normal] of students’ learning is
[normal] the fixing of failure in the working classes. 
[normal] While most of my research is on secondary school students I carried out a research study on the impact  of testing on primary age children. Below are two
[normal] quotes from white working class girls: 
[normal]Norma: I’m really worried about the SATs.
[normal]D: Why?
[normal]Norma: Well
[normal] it seems like I’ll get no points or I won’t be able to
[normal]do it, too hard or something.
[normal]D: What would it mean to get no points?
[normal]Norma: Well instead of being a level three I’ll be a nothing and
[normal]do badly – very badly.
[normal]And:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Sharon: I think I’ll get a two, only
[normal] Stuart will get a six.
[normal]D: So if Stuart gets a six, what will that say about him?
[normal]Sharon: He’s heading for a good job and a good life, and it shows
[normal]he’s not 
[normal]gonna
[normal] be living on the streets and stuff like that.
[normal]D: And if you get a level two, what will that 
[normal]say about you?
[normal]Sharon: Um, I might not have a good life in front of me, and I might
[normal]grow up and do something naughty.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The quotes make visible the system of value that produces the middle classes as valuable academic stars whilst simultaneously generating 
[normal]a working class that is represented within the current testing regimes as ‘incapable’ of having a self with value. This is further revealed in Sharon’s poignant summation of class destinies and how they are tied to academic achi
[normal]evement. 
[normal]As the  children’s 
[normal]quotes illustrate, at the micro-level of the classroom there are regular glimpses of the 
[normal]normalising
[normal] and regulatory function of testing on children. However, although children expressed anxieties across class differences, it was not the white middle-class 
[normal]boys panicking about being exposed as no good through the assessment procedures. Rather, it was white working-class girls 
[normal]who agonized the most
[normal] that they would be ‘a nothing’. And the risks of finding they have very little value are disproportionately high
[normal] for such working class girls. These girls, in the context of schooling, inhabit a psychic economy of class defined by fear, anxiety and unease where failure looms large and success is elusive; a place where too often they are seen
[normal] and see themselves as la
[normal]cking value
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.   
[normal]The increase in setting and streaming compounds and reinforces working class pupils
[normal]’
[normal] sense of  failure, they come to see themselves as ‘bottom set kids’  or in ‘a rubbish group’ but it also leads to class segregation 
[normal]in state schooling 
[normal]as these quotes from 
[normal]middle class pupils at state comprehensives 
[normal] show: 
[normal]My friends and I were a bit scared of all the 
[normal]chavs
[normal] there may be in secondary but its fine 
[normal]cos
[normal] we are in the top set and they are all in the bottom sets so I don’t have to see them (O
[normal]livia year 8)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It was quite tough
[normal] in the first year with the 
[normal]cha
[normal]vs
[normal]  but now I’m in year 8 its fine 
[normal]cos
[normal] I’ve been moved up to the higher sets and they’ve been moved down so I’m away from them (Jessie year 8)
[normal]The consequences for the white working classes[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal]0.    
[normal]The findings from the research projects I have conducted 
[normal]reveal how the educational system works to positively affirm white 
[normal]upper and 
[normal]middle class identities, acting as a means of finding yourself as a successful ‘bright’ learner. In contrast, the ed
[normal]ucational system is rarely about positive affirmation for the working classes.  They are at far greater risk of losing rather than finding themselves, of both being unable to construct a successful learner identity and feeling  that their working class roo
[normal]ts and sense of self have no value in a context where working class culture and identity is constructed as a hindrance to academic achievement. The sense of shame and humiliation was palpable throughout the interviews I carried out with white working class
[normal] pupils in London schools fo
[normal]r an ESCR study on pupils’  perspectives on their teaching and learning
[normal]: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Danny: Some teachers say, ‘That isn’t the way you talk’ – like
[normal]putting you down. I think telling you a different way is
[normal]sort of good, but I think the way
[normal] they do it isn’t good
[normal]because they make you look stupid.
[normal]Martin: Those teachers look down on you
[normal]Danny: Yeah, like they think you’re dumb … we don’t expect them
[normal]to treat us like their own children. We’re not. But we are
[normal]still kids. I’d say to them, You’ve
[normal] got kids. You treat them
[normal]with love but you don’t need to love us. All you need to
[normal]do is treat us like humans.
[normal]These commonplace feelings of  shame and humiliation often turned into a sense of futility and pointlessness in relation to academic learning: 
[normal]D
[normal]iane : If you had a choice what would you choose to learn?
[normal]  
[normal]Jason: Nothing 
[normal]George: Nothing 
[normal]Andy: No idea 
[normal]Paul: Definitely nothing we get here
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]11.    
[normal]In the project secondary school students were asked  whether they felt that they had the confidence t
[normal]o act within schooling; whether they felt they belonged, as individuals and as groups, within the school communi
[normal]ty
[normal]. The vast majority of the working class students talked about a sense of  powerlessness and educational worthlessness,  and feelings that the
[normal]y were not really valued and respected within education. But it was 
[normal] white 
[normal]working class boys, in particular, who manifested the 
[normal] greatest sense of 
[normal]alienation
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]12.    
[normal]W
[normal]hite working class students are expected to make difficult choices between prioritizin
[normal]g official pedagogic practices on the one hand and local pedagogic practices on the other,  and for boys in particular, between popularity among the peer group  and an elusive successful learner identity. This is especially so for white working clas
[normal]s boys 
[normal] like Shaun quoted below: 
[normal] 
[normal]Shaun: Like now I am different in the classroom than I am in the playground, I am just different.
[normal]Diane: Right, so how are you different?
[normal]Shaun: In the classroom I am not myself. I am hard working and everything. In the playgrou
[normal]nd, yeah, I’m back to my usual self…just being normal.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Shaun recognizes that,  unlike their middle class counterparts, working class students need to transform their identity in order to succeed. And transformation is a fraught, risky, and often painful struggle if you and your kind have historically been, and
[normal] are currently positioned as ‘other’ to the educated, intelligent and cultured subject. For Shaun academic success is not normative and he has to literally think  and enact himself as ‘other’ in order to attempt to do well. Facing an educational competitio
[normal]n they cannot win they construct  peer group macho and physically aggressive competitions where some of  them can and do win. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Social Justice for the white working classes[bold]13.    
[normal]I 
[normal]grow up during the early years of the welfare state, the daughter of a coal miner living in a newly built council estate. An expanding welfare state 
[normal] 
[normal]and a pervasive rhetoric of providing services and homes fit for working- class war heroes raised
[normal] 
[normal]the sens
[normal]e of pride and entitlement among the working classes. It
[normal] also softened some of the judg
[normal]mental superiority of significant numbers of the middle and upper classes towards those they traditionally viewed as inferior. Also, entering the 
[normal]labour
[normal] market during a 
[normal]period of large-scale expansion of 
[normal] 
[normal]professional jobs meant gaining a middle-class job was much more likely than it is in the economically austere 2010s. Such economic and social circumstances were far more 
[normal]favourable
[normal] to working-class upward mobility  than
[normal] the current situation, and eased what was s
[normal]till a difficult trajectory for man
[normal]y working-class children like myself. 
[normal]14.    
[normal]The roots of my 
[normal]social mobility lay in a
[normal] synergy between 
[normal]a working-class community
[normal] characterized by  a powerful sense o
[normal]f pride in b
[normal]eing working class and 
[normal]a strong and informed political consciousness, and a very particular historical juncture. Without these predisposing
[normal] 
[normal]factors, my social mobility would not have occurred. I certainly would not have been socially mobile as a child grow
[normal]ing up in the early twenty-first century.
[normal]15.    
[normal]W
[normal]e need an educational sy
[normal]stem founded on respect for
[normal] the white working classes
[normal] instead of trying to make them all middle class
[normal]; a system that accords po
[normal]sitive value and meaning to
[normal] 
[normal]worki
[normal]ngclassness
[normal]. 
[normal]W
[normal]hile
[normal] 
[normal]the 3Rs are  important, teaching children to be  caring, respectful,  cooperative, knowledgeable about their own and others’ histories, and well informed about contemporary global 
[normal]issues are equally 
[normal]important. There is a great deal of scope for widening cu
[normal]rrently narrowly conceived teaching and learning oppo
[normal]rtunities, and for  developing 
[normal] pedagogies
[normal]  that  encourage students to question  as well as develop 
[normal]social and political awareness. 
[normal]Teaching for social justice 
[normal]requires a reflexive focus  on all pupils:
[normal] 
[normal] What are their hopes, dreams and 
[normal]aspir
[normal]ations? Their passions and commitments? What skills, abilities, and capacities does eac
[normal]h one bring to the classroom? As Ayers (1998) argues ‘t
[normal]eaching for social justice is teaching that arouses students, engages them
[normal] in a quest to identify obstacles to their full humanity, to their freedom, and then to drive, to move a
[normal]gainst those obstacles
[normal].
[normal]16.    
[normal]A revalorizing of vocational  and working class 
[normal]knowledges
[normal] and a broadening out of what constitutes educational success b
[normal]eyond the nar
[normal]rowly academic is long overdue. T
[normal]here needs to be  not only a 
[normal]focus on, and valuing of, the existing 
[normal]knowledges
[normal] of working-class young people,
[normal] but also pedagogies which 
[normal]emphasise
[normal] 
[normal]collectivist, rather than individualistic approaches to 
[normal]learning.
[normal]17.    
[normal]Until we eradicate class contempt schools will continue to be characterized by pervasive 
[normal]and 
[normal]damaging working class educational failure. 
[normal]T
[normal]he political elites and the middle class majority 
[normal] need 
[normal]to critically 
[normal]analyse
[normal], understand and take re
[normal]sponsibility for a situation that only they
[normal] have the power and resources to
[normal] remedy
[normal], 
[normal] but creating an educational system that 
[normal]works towards decreasing
[normal] the social , economic and educational distance between the social classes, both within schools and wider s
[normal]ociety, would be a good place to start.

[normal]
