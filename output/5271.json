"              \n              \nBUR 14C\nFurther written evidence submitted by the Department for International Development&#xa0;Health Expenditure as a Proportion of DFID Burma’s Budget - Clarification&#xa0;\nHealth now accounts for \nroughly \none third of DFID Burma’s expenditure over the current Operational Plan period (2011/12 to 2014/15) – \nas indicated \nin the table submitted in the Memorandum to the IDC’\ns inquiry (page 5\n). \n A\nn older chart \nreproduced on page 7\n \nof the Memorandum \nindicated\n that health expenditure was closer to half. \nThe di\nfference \narises due to the changing pattern of DFID Burma’s expenditure since the start of the Operational Plan.\n&#xa0;\nIn particular, w\ne have a \ncommitment of up to £80m for the 3MDG Fund\n to 2016\n. Most of this \ncould potentially have \nbe\nen\n \nspent within the O\nperational \nP\nlan\n period\n,\n but over £30m of this will now fall into later years. \nThis is due in part to slower than expected expenditure by \nthe \n3MDG \nFund \nand partly due to DFID Burma prioritising new work in other sectors as the reform environment improved and new opportunities arose. \nWe were also allocated \nadditional \nbudget of \n£6m \nin September\n 2014\n, which was \nallocated to non-health sectors – this also reduced the proportion of our budget spent on health. \nH\nealt\nh\n \nremains our largest area of expenditure\n, \nbut e\nxpenditure in other sectors has grown\n more quickly\n reducing the proportion accounted for by health to about a third\n.\n  In addition to ‘pure’ health programmes, a proportion of our humanitarian budget also goes to funding health services to internally displaced people and refugees in camps\n (note this expenditure is not included in the health expenditure figures quoted above)\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n15 January 2014\nDFID Burma\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
