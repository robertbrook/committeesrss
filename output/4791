[normal]The focus on data accuracy and integrity only addresses one part of the issue surrounding how confident the public and policy makers can be that crime statistics can be relied
[normal] on. The unasked question seems to be whether data can be compared between forces with confidence (i.e. is the data reliable). The answer to this is almost certainly not. There is a degree of flexibility in the system currently that even when recording in 
[normal]accordance with the guidance set out in the National Crime Recording Standards and within agreed time frames there are significant differences in the resulting data. In addition how each force interprets the NCRS can vary slightly but significantly, for ex
[normal]ample the line between anti-social behaviour (a non-crime incident), public disorder (an offence against society) and low level violence (a victim-based crime) is particularly blurred. What is needed to address this is a means of measuring more reliably, a
[normal]nd accounting for, variability in compliance and recording between forces.
