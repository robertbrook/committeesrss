defaultThe cost of the Government's reforms of the financing of higher education – an update defaultJohn Thompson and defaultBahramdefault defaultBekhradniadefault default&#xa0;
default1. 
defaultThis update sets out the information that has become available since our last report on the cost the Government's reforms (Thompson et al, 2012) and considers some of the criticisms made of that report. By far the biggest change has been the announcement on 5 December by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that Government was to ‘abolish the cap on student numbers altogether’. Our first thoughts on this radical development are set out under the final heading – ‘The Autumn Statement’. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe cost of loans default&#xa0;
defaultIntroduction 
default&#xa0;
default2. Student loans are provided to students by the government to pay the fees now charged by universities. The total cost to the Government has the following elements: the number of students, their loan entitlements, the loan take-up rates and the Resource Accounting and Budgeting (RAB) cost – representing the ratio of loan subsidy to the total loans. Student numbers are discussed under the final section of this memorandum ‘The Autumn Statement’. Most of the rest of this discussion concerns the RAB cost. 
default&#xa0;
default3. Any serious attempt to estimate the RAB cost involves the construction of a complex model which needs reliable forecasts of a range of measures, in particular the distribution of the earnings of former students over more than three decades. Rather than make our own model, we have used the BIS ‘simplified model’, available to anyone, to explore various ‘what ifs’, and to assess the plausibility of the various assumptions made in the light of publically available evidence. In our previous report we concluded that the Government’s estimates were highly uncertain, and probably optimistic. The uncertainty is inevitable given the repayment conditions, which mean that a large part of the repayments will be made far in the future, and it is unlikely that a way will be found to significantly reduce this uncertainty. Since March 2011 to the most recent estimate, the Government’s estimate of the RAB cost has increased from 30 per cent to between 35 and 40 per cent (
defaultWilletts
default, 2013d). This most recent estimate still does not take account of our main concerns, in particular the assumption that earnings growth will be uniform. If this turns out not to be the case, which we think is quite likely, the RAB charge could end up higher. 
default&#xa0;
default4. We previously reported that London Economics had estimated the RAB cost at 37.0 per cent in the work they undertook for BIS in estimating the returns to higher education (Conlon G et al, 2011). This is year they completed a study looking at different higher education funding systems (Conlon G, 2013). Their RAB estimate for full-time students with the current fee and repayment conditions was 39.4 per cent. 
default5. The RAB is important. According to the Government a 1 percentage point increase in the RAB equates to £100 million extra expenditure in 2014-15 (
defaultWilletts
default, 2013d). So a 10 percentage point increase amounts to about £1 billion per year of unbudgeted expenditure. It should be appreciated that the RAB expenditure effects the balance sheet of the department, BIS, which, in the context of higher education policy is what we are usually concerned with. However, it does not have immediate impact on the public debt (Public Sector Net Debt or PSND), which increases by the whole amount loaned until repayments are actually made. This other way of accounting for the cost of loans is discussed below in the sections on the discount rate and on the ’
defaultAutumn
default statement’
default.
default 
default6. Following the Autumn Statement it is clear Government is putting the sale of the loans at the heart of its policy for the funding higher education. The RAB cost is relevant to this because the feasibility of selling loans at all, and the proceeds that will come from any sale, depend on both the best estimate of the size and timing of repayments, and the uncertainty associated with that estimate. Both of these are reflected in the RAB estimate. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTake-up and size of fee and maintenance loans 
default&#xa0;
default7. 
defaultThe cost to the Government is affected both by the extent to which loans are taken up and by the size of the loans. In this respect, present evidence suggests that the BIS assumptions about the size of fee loans actually made in 2013 – £7490 according to the SLC, compared to the BIS estimate of £7579 – was, if anything, conservative; while the size of maintenance loans was a little higher than had been assumed.
default8. Taken together the fee and maintenance loans per borrower for 2012-13 ‘new system’ borrowers seem close to what BIS is assuming. However, should the average fee loan increase in future years, which seems likely, there would be increased costs. An increase in the average loan increases costs both by increasing the RAB and by the increase in total sum borrowed. As a rough rule of thumb a £100 increase in the fee loan would increase costs by about £50 million per annum.
default 
default9. We do not yet know for certain what loan take-up will be, but the indications are that it will be higher than previous cost assumptions. If both fee and maintenance rates were 90 per cent, which seems possible, this would increase costs compared to the White Paper assumptions by about £140 million per annum.
defaultFuture average earnings 
default10. The estimates from the BIS model are insensitive to long term growth in average wages. This is because the projected earnings of former students and the future repayment threshold level are both increased annually in line with average earnings. 
default11. However, the BIS model is sensitive to changes in average ‘cash’ earnings between 2009 and 2016. This is because the threshold for the first year of repayments is set at 
default£21,000 (2016 prices) and the graduate earnings data in the model are updated from 2009 in line with average earnings. If the average earning increases are reduced up to 2016 the graduate earnings will be lower relative to the threshold, and repayments will be lower. This potentially impacts on the repayments through the whole 30 year repayment period, because of the annual updating of the threshold. 
default12. The OBR forecasts for earnings in December 2012 (OBR, 2012) reduced the average earnings forecast in the years up to the start of repayments in 2016, and this was probably an important factor in BIS increasing their RAB estimate from 32 per cent to 35 per cent. The most recent OBR forecasts (OBR, 2013), shows a further small reduction in the increase in average earnings between 2009 and 2016.
default Though not enough on its own to lead to a further revision of the RAB, it will bring a further small upward pressure. 
default13. As we have pointed our previously, the distribution of the assumed average increases in earnings can be more important than their average level. In our modelling we showed, for example, that a scenario where the lowest 80 per cent had their long term income growth cut to only a quarter of the OBR projected rate, and all the savings went to enhanced increases to the top 20 per cent, the RAB cost increased by a further 4.2 percentage points. 
default14. It seems likely that, even if the career growth in earnings is maintained on average, the spread will increase. That is, while top earners may see an even bigger growth in earnings over their lifetime, those in the lower range of earnings will not see the growth in earnings over their careers that has been typical, at least for men, for those in ‘graduate’ jobs in the past. In the USA only high earners have seen increases in real earnings over three decades, and in the UK increasing dispersion of graduate earnings is now being observed. 
default15. As we have pointed out previously, the fact that top earners earn very much more does not mean that they will pay any more by way of loan repayments, and their high salaries will not compensate for the lower salaries and consequently lower loan repayments of others. And if median and low earners earn less than has been assumed then that will reduce the loan repayments, and increase the cost to the Government.
defaultEarnings and repayments – NAO report
default 
default16. The NAO report (NAO, 2013) is mainly concerned with the effectiveness of BIS, the SLC and HMRC in the collection of student loan payments, but it also contains some observations about the forecasting methods. These forecasts are discussed in terms of existing loans and repayments, but the observations made are relevant to the new loans being taken out by students starting the university courses from 2012-13. 
default17. Using the BIS model they examined the effect of replacing OBR economic growth and inflation estimates (as used by BIS) by using estimates from the Bank of England and the IMF. These alternatives gave lower RAB vales, showing that the BIS’s choice has been ‘prudent’. However, they warn that even using OBR inputs, the results ‘will not necessarily 
defaultfully reflect the economic climate’. In particular they point to evidence which suggest that past growth in average earnings will not continue as the model assumes, and that there is evidence which suggests that future growth will not be uniform, that is there will be ‘dispersion’ of income growth - which is also an assumed, and which is discussed above. We had identified future earnings growth and especially dispersion as the two most important reasons for treating the RAB estimates as uncertain and optimistic. 
default18. The report shows that the forecast of repayments from BIS’s HERO model exceeded actual repayments in both 2010-11 and 2011-12. This is the same underlying model that has been used to estimate the RAB costs for 2012-13 and later entrants, so we have another indication that the longer term RAB estimates are optimistic. Overall, the NAO report is supportive of the position we have taken.
default 
defaultGovernment’s cost of borrowing - the discount rate default19. The Minister of Universities and Science criticised our earlier report as one sided (
defaultWilletts
default, 2012), mainly because we had neglected to take account of the assumed cost to Government of borrowing, which he said had exaggerated the public costs. He claimed that the Government estimate was at the ‘middle of a range of forecasts’, between that suggested by some (unnamed) economists and the HEPI analysis. 
default20. 
defaultLeunig
default (
defaultLeunig
default, 2012) and 
defaultShephard
default (
defaultShephard
default, 2013) have made the case for Government to reduce the ‘discount rate’, currently set at 2.2 per cent per annum, which is often described as reflecting the cost over and above inflation to Government of borrowing, assuming all loans are repaid. The arguments are complex, but at their heart is the observation that Government could finance student loans through borrowing in the gilts market more cheaply than reflected in the current discount rate. Of course this could change. In future the costs of this borrowing could, probably will, increase, but the cost for the current student cohorts would be fixed by the long term bonds taken out as the loans were made. 
default21. The discount rate used in the RAB calculation is set by the Treasury, and any change in assumptions about this would need to be made by them. Setting the discount rate is made in compliance with international accounting standards. Let us suppose that those standards supported a reduction in the discount rate and it was decided that the rate should be reduced. This would reduce the RAB estimate and BIS’s costs, but the normal concomitant change would be a reduction in BIS’s budget, so that there would not provide extra funds, for example to increase student numbers. Further, suppose the discount rate, and hence the RAB estimate, were reduced, but that repayments were subsequently predicted to be lower than those assumed when the original calculations had been made. Even if the resulting RAB was still lower than the current RAB based on a 2.2 per cent per annum discount rate, it is likely that the Treasury would expect the increased costs due to lower repayment rates and lower RAB to be met from savings within BIS’s remit. The implications for higher education would be just as serious as would be the case with the current discount. 
default22. The main points in the Treasury’s position are anticipated by 
defaultShephard
default, who acknowledges that his argument needs to be more subtle when applied to the National Accounts. The problem can be presented in different ways but, put simply, it arises because though a reduction in the RAB charge will reduce the departmental spending, it will not have the same effect on the Public Sector Net Debt (PSND) which includes the totality of student loans when they are made, not just the RAB costs, and is only reduced when students repay. The ‘student loan book’- the Government asset created by student loans - is not included within the PSND because it is not classified as a liquid asset. The case made by both 
defaultLeunig
default and 
defaultShephard
default hinges on student loans being a special case. So far, it seems, this argument has not been accepted by the Treasury, or if they have, they are unable or unwilling to implement an arrangement which would effectively separate student loans from other Government debt. 
default23. Under these circumstances we think it is unwise to treat the current discount rate as a safety net which ensures the Government higher education policies against lower than expected repayment rates; and indeed, the Government seems to have stopped claiming this as evidence that its RAB estimate is in the middle of two extremes. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe impact of fees on inflation default&#xa0;
default24. Tuition fees are included in the calculation of the both the Retail Price Index (RPI) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The increase in fees from 2012-13 will have therefore increased inflation and thereby various state benefits linked to inflation, thereby increasing expenditure. We estimated this increase to be up to £1.14 billion per annum. 
default25. However, since then Government decided not to continue to update welfare benefits in line with the CPI, most of the impact will not occur. The state pension continues to be uprated with the ‘triple-lock’ guarantee and rises by the highest of average earnings growth, CPI inflation and 2.5 per cent. The CPI figure for September 2013, which would usually inform the increases from April 2014 was, 2.7 per cent, higher than average wage increases at 2.5 per cent. 
default26. We estimated that the 2012-13 increase in fees will have contributed 0.24 per cent to this September’s inflation
default, and as a result the state and public sector pensions would be uprated by 2.7% instead of 2.5 per cent. The 0.2 per cent extra expenditure equates to £290 million.
default 
default&#xa0;
default27. Increased annual costs could be triggered in future years as further cohorts entering universities with the new fee arrangements produce further inflation effects. However, given that welfare benefits are not linked to inflation, this depends on whether inflation in is higher than 2.5 per cent and the percentage increase in average earnings, apart from the small impact on expenditure on public service pensions. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultThe Autumn Statement default&#xa0;
default28. A rising RAB charge would put pressure on public expenditure and in our previous report we considered the ways that any shortfall might be met. One of the possible options was to hold down student numbers, which, in view of the then OBR assumption that numbers would be ‘flat’, seemed to be a likely possibility. So, the news that Government was going to remove controls on student numbers came as a surprise. 
default29. Others have welcomed the announcement because it means more of those who can benefit from higher education will be able to do so. We believe that such a welcome is premature until we know how the expansion will be funded, and what the consequences will be of meeting the increased costs. Not since the early 1990s has the Government given an open-ended commitment to provide funding for as many students as universities might recruit. The consequences for the future shape and costs of higher education are potentially as significant as all that we have seen from the 2012 changes so far. It will take some time to tease out the details and consequences of the changes, but we give our first assessment here. (Unless stated otherwise, all references are to paragraphs in the Autumn Statement (HMT, 2013b) as ‘HMT- paragraph’, or to the OBR Economic and fiscal outlook (OBR, 2013) as ‘OBR – paragraph’.) 
default30. The cap is to be raised for publically funded institutions by 30,000 entrants per year in 2014-15. From 2015-16 the cap is to be removed, which the Government believes will enable a total extra 60,000 entrants per year to be recruited (HMT-1.202).
default This is the number that the Government believes will meet unmet demand. In 2014-15 private institutions are to have their numbers controlled on the basis of 2012-13 levels, but from 2015-16 they will be ‘freed in a similar manner as for HEFCE-funded provision’ (HMT-1.204). Despite the Government representing this announcement of a removal of the cap on student numbers, it may nevertheless represent an implicit cap – present numbers plus 60,000 additional entrants per year. The Government announcement is silent about what will happen if universities seek to recruit more than this number. 
default&#xa0;
default31. An extra 60,000 entrants would represent a significant expansion, particularly as even zero growth would mean an increase in the participation rate up to 2020, due to decreases in the numbers in the relevant age cohorts.
default Were the unmet demand to be less than 60,000, the cap could be lifted at lower cost than is anticipated. In the Government’s eyes this would not represent a failure. The Robbins’ aspiration for all those with the ability and wish for study to be able to find a place would have been met, and, just as important, the Government’s aim to free higher education providers from student number controls as a way to increase competition would be realised. If more than 60,000 students were recruited that would create a budgetary problem, but it might be offset by the introduction of market conditions whose benefits could include downward pressure on costs and improvements in quality. Whether increased competition would improve quality, as is asserted (HMT-1.204), can be contested. It certainly should not be assumed 
defaultthat competition automatically improves quality.
default There is some recognition of this by Government, with their concerns about quality following the rapid expansion of provision by private providers (HMT-1.204). However, the value and risks of competition is a different issue, and here our main concern is with costs of lifting the cap and how those costs will be met. 
default&#xa0;
defaultA Cap without Controls? 
default&#xa0;
default32. Assessing historic unmet demand is difficult, and predicting it in the future is even more difficult, and while the demand may be fully met by a 60,000 increase in entrant numbers, it would be unwise to count on it, particularly with universities encouraged to expand. With the entrepreneurial spirit that the Government wants to cultivate, providers can and probably will find latent demand and even create new demand. Already large numbers of students with no UCAS tariff scores enter higher education. No one can know how many more might be sought out and recruited by universities exercising a new freedom to recruit without limit. And EU students represent an almost unlimited additional potential source of demand. Given the importance the Government attaches to reducing public debt, it seems unlikely that the Treasury would agree to the open-ended financial commitment implied by a complete lifting of student number limits. There is presumably a budget, which means that there must be an assumed limit on student number, or a plan to reduce the unit of public funding if the numbers assumed in the budget are exceeded. 
default&#xa0;
default33. The conundrum is how to remove controls on providers while ensuring the total numbers are within the planned spending commitments, that is how to implement a ‘soft cap’. One option would be to wait and see what happens, with restoring controls as an option in reserve. The Government has said that it ‘reserves the right to 
defaultreimpose
default number controls on institutions that expand their student numbers at the expense of quality’ (HMT-1.204). But this is may not provide any sort of effective control in the event of budget overrun. The problem may not manifest itself as poor quality institutional provision: but the control will anyway need to be exercised for purely budgetary reasons. 
default34
default. 
defaultThe other option would be for Whitehall to become the sector’s admissions tutor by setting minimum entry qualifications for higher education entry; this is the Browne Review proposal. Such an arrangement has major implications for university autonomy and also for widening participation (given the high number of students admitted without qualifications recognised by UCAS). Also the practical problems of defining what constitutes the minimum entry qualifications should not be underestimated. But neither of these two difficulties stopped Government introducing a ‘Browne-
defaultlite
default’ change by removing caps on recruitment of students with high grades. There is a hint that such a ‘soft cap’ might be favoured. The expansion is to provide for young people ‘who have the grades to enter higher education’ (HMT-1.202). What qualifications? What grades? Who decides? 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultMeeting the costs 
default&#xa0;
default35. The cost of the proposed expansion of student and teaching grants is estimated to be £720 million per annum by 2018-19. And the loan subsidy will increase by £700 million per annum ‘in the medium term’ (HMT-1.203). Assuming that the expansion reaches 60,000 entrants per year, and that these are full-time students averaging three years of study
default, this equates to £7900 per student year. This shows an intention to expand without reducing the unit of resource.
default Since the publication of the White Paper introducing £9000 fees and new repayment conditions, the Government’s estimate of the RAB cost has increased from 30 per cent to between 35 and 40 per cent.
default Should there be further increases in the RAB, the £700 million cost for loan subsidies would also increase. We think this is possible, or even likely, given that the extra marginal students recruited would be expected to have lower average earnings on leaving higher education. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHow are these additional spending commitments to be met? The increase in student loans, and student and teaching grants will increase spending by £1.42 billion a year according to the Government’s estimates. Unless savings are made elsewhere, they will need to increase the higher education budget. There is no commitment to such an increase. We are told that ‘this expansion is affordable within a reducing level of public sector net borrowing as a result of the reforms to higher education finance the government has enacted’ (HMT-1.203). Yet the current plans before the decision to expand must surely have taken account of those reforms. The OBR makes clear that such expenditure ‘would reduce the amount available for departments to spend on other things when plans for those years are set out in future spending reviews’ (OBR-1.9). 
default&#xa0;
default36. The increase in student numbers does not only affect departmental expenditure, it also has a distinct and bigger impact on the public debt. Before repayments on the extra loans start being paid to any significant extent the Public Sector Net Debt (PSND) will increase by about £2 billion for each year.
default The solution proposed by the Government to the problem posed by these increased costs is to sell the pre-2012 income contingent loans book, and use the proceeds from this sale to finance the additional loans over the forecast period (HMT-1.203). The sale will be in five tranches and the proceeds for the first four are shown as adding £2.3 billion a year to the ‘Net Cash Requirement’ from 2015-16 to 2018-19 (HMT-2.10, table 2.5). This sale will reduce the future receipts from repayments. According to the OBR, by 2018-19, selling the loan book reduces Government income through loan repayments by ‘just under £1 billion in 2018-19’ (OBR-4.145). So although by then some repayments from the additional entrants in 2014-15 through to 
default2017-18 will have started to come through, the repayment receipts will be negligible in comparison with the £1 billion annual loss of income from the loan book sale. The loss of repayments means that the all five tranches of the sale will only provide net proceeds to cover the increased debt from expansion to 2019-20. From 2020-21 onwards there will be a cumulative shortfall, unless there were further loan book sales. 
default&#xa0;
default37. The future repayments from income contingent loans are more uncertain than repayments from mortgage loans, so this coming sale will be more difficult and the net proceeds are likely to be proportionately lower. The Government is confident that will raise between £10 billion and £15 billion with a central estimate of £12 billion (HMT 2.16). Given the history of attempted loan book sales, some may argue that this policy is not without risk, for example that no deal can be made at a price that makes the sale worthwhile. However, for the purposes of this discussion we will assume that the sale is successful, an
defaultd that it releases £12 billion
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default38. The problem remains that while the proceeds from the tranches of sales last five years, the increased numbers of students continue to add £2 billion a year to the public debt after these sales are completed. When questioned about the sustainability of the approach, a BIS source was reported as saying, ‘new student loans get taken out all the time, so there are always in theory newer loans the government could sell on’ (Ramesh, 2013). Such an argument does not stand up. The loan sale proposed is based on a loan book built up over many years; it cannot be repeated, at least not as frequently as would be required. It has many of the characteristics of a Ponzi scheme, relying on diminishing future income to make good increasing present deficits. When all the pre-2012 student loans are sold, the challenge of selling the loans given to more recent entrants will be much more difficult. This is because the repayment terms for the post 2012-13 entrants are more complex, with a longer repayment period, and more of the repayments expected decades hence. 
default&#xa0;
default39. The problems are s summed up more succinctly by Carl 
defaultEmmerson
default, Deputy Director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. He pointed out that the idea that new loans will be financed by selling the old student loan book is ‘economically nonsense as selling an asset for what it is worth does not strengthen the public finances’.
default 
default&#xa0;
default40. At best the current policy can only be a bridge for a few years prior to an increased budget for higher education, or to 
defaultreduced
default student numbers, or to a cheaper package. The elements of such a lower-cost package have been well rehearsed: maintenance grants turned into loans, less generous loan repayment terms, cuts in the teaching grant or cuts in other parts of the HE budget. 
default&#xa0;
default41. In conclusion, the lifting of the cap is to be welcomed in so far as it will extend opportunities to benefit from higher education. The Government also sees the removal of 
defaultthe cap as a way freeing providers from student number controls and thereby encouraging competition. It should be understood that increased competitions carries risks as well as opportunities. It seems that, after their experience in providing competition from private providers, Government may be recognising at least some of those risks. But a much greater concern is that the proposals do not seem sustainable in the medium term, leading to even greater uncertainty as to what students and HE providers can expect in the near future.

defaultWe have not yet found the source of the estimate of unmet demand at 60,000.

defaultThis is a conservative assumption. According to HEFCE the usual mix of course lengths and non-continuation patterns would imply an average length of 2.7 giving an average cost of £8765
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultThe estimated average public cost for new system students in 2014-15 will be £6500 (
defaultWilletts
default, 2013b, slide 14 of PowerPoint presentation). This is lower than the implied unit cost in the Autumn Statement, even after allowing for four years of inflation, and it has a much higher proportion of loan subsidy (£4200). It has been suggested that the difference could be due to the 2014-15 figures incorporating the proposals to replace grants with loans that have been reported in the Guardian (Malik et al, 2003).
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultA RAB value of 30 per cent was quoted in the White Paper, but the White Paper cost calculations used 32 per cent (Thompson et al, 2011). For the latest estimate see 
defaultWilletts
default, (2013d).

default 
defaultAssuming a RAB charge of 35 per cent; the debt must be £700 million x 100 / 35 = £2 billion. This is for ‘the medium term’. For 2018-19 the figure given is £1.93 billion (HMT-2.10 table 2.5)
default 
defaultWe make this assumption in order to progress our examination of the case made in the Autumn Statement, though a sale is not certain. According to a BIS information sheet, ’the decision to go ahead with any sale has not yet been taken and will require a full assessment of the value for money to the taxpayer of selling the loans versus retaining them’. There is no explanation as to what would happen to the plans to remove the cap should the loans not be sold.
