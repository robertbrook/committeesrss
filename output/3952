[normal]Written evidence submitted by Dr Margaret [bold]Sealey[bold] [FBB0021][bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The present Royal Charter states that “The BBC exists to promote the public interest”. My comments concern two of the areas in which the BBC has this responsibility to promote Public Purposes, namely: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Unfortunately the BBC fails in both of t
[normal]hese Purposes, and I shall be expanding on this
[normal];
[normal] and in some departments (not all – and these are the less subscribed, less popular radio programmes e.g. the Radio 4 
[normal]Sunday
[normal] prog
[normal]ramme from which I have had courteous replies)
[normal] there seems to be little response
[normal] following a comment
[normal] or complaint
[normal]. The output of the television channels, I have found, it is quite useless to remark upon – there is simply no interest in what viewers have to
[normal] say.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Sustaining Citizenship and Civil Society.
[normal]  
[normal]The output from the BBC 
[normal]regularly
[normal] does not encourage responsible behaviour. My particular concerns are the portrayal of vio
[normal]lence and loose sexual values. 
[normal]1)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Violence
[normal].  
[normal]Apart from the depiction of bloody viole
[normal]nce in many programmes – even in wild life programmes, where animal behaviour seems to be presented as a model for human behaviour - i
[normal]n television soaps, for example, people are frequently 
[normal]furious
[normal] and glaring daggers at each other: the way to be is 
[normal]angry
[normal] a
[normal]nd abusive
[normal], and t
[normal]earing people apart
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]at least verbally
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]With regard to wild life programmes, presenters like David Attenborough seem to consider human beings the scourge of the planet. 
[normal]The Scare of overpopulation has been around since Malthus in the 1700’
[normal]s. 
[normal]The population not only eat the cake, they also make it, and in fact are necessary for economic development. Scarcities are brought about by greed, wars and the abuse of the planet. It has been shown by those who have done the mathematics that the whole
[normal] of the earth’s population could be accommodated comfortably in the state of Texas. The real population problem is a catastrophic fall in the birth rate
[normal] in Western countries
[normal], so 
[normal]that 
[normal]there a
[normal]re insufficient young people 
[normal]in a population that can look forward
[normal] to a longer life expectancy
[normal]. Thus the proponents of abortion and contraception are the proponents also of euthanasia. The general idea: hate people. People are a scourge. 
[normal]It is irresponsible broadcasting that is the great scourge, not people who can be in
[normal]fluenced for good or evil
[normal] – by the BBC
[normal].
[normal]2)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Loose Sexual Behaviour
[normal].   Loose sexual behaviour results in family breakdown and endless misery, particularly for the children involved who 
[normal]have no models of commitment and self sacrificing love in their parents, and
[normal] therefore grow up in a kind of de
[normal]s
[normal]pair
[normal] and a sense of alienation from those who should be nearest to them. It is not surprising if they feel alienated from society as a whole. Who can be trusted? Apart from that
[normal], through the attitudes of the media general
[normal]ly, the BBC included,
[normal] they are betrayed and enticed into early sexual experimentation so that sexually transmitted diseases ar
[normal]e epidemic; 
[normal]moreover, 
[normal]a young person becomes prey to
[normal] the psychological 
[normal]and relational 
[normal]problems loose sexual encounters cause
[normal], seve
[normal]rely damaging his/her prospects of forming a stable relationship, fit to build a family on, in the future. Loose sexual behaviour is regularly represented as the way to behave. The BBC 
[normal]are
[normal] among the first to decry aberrant sexual behaviour in others, but t
[normal]he 
[normal]first to present it as a pattern for peoples’ lives. Recently, for example, even on the Radio 4 
[normal]Today
[normal] programme, a family, breakfast programme, a retired football coach was interviewed concerning his debaucheries. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Stimulating Creativity and Cultural 
[normal]Excellence.
[normal]  When one is talking about culture, one has to decide what kind of culture, and cultural excellence, it is t
[normal]hat it is desirable to stimula
[normal]te.  Over sexualisation and violence in programmes do not advance the cause of mutual respect between the 
[normal]sexes, but the tea
[normal]ring apart of society.  Culture -
[normal] drama, music,
[normal] literature, art -
[normal] 
[normal]it always seemed to me, was there to 
[normal]help us to understand our human condition and react wisely and positively in our difficulties, and to be elevated and comforted by beau
[normal]ty, kindness and heroism. The culture of our country in earlier times did this. Th
[normal]e BBC, even when
[normal] presenting classics, does not 
[normal]now 
[normal]do this. 
[normal]The days of 
[normal]Pride and 
[normal]Prejudice
[normal], for example, embodying the values that the author intended, are over. 
[normal]In
[normal] presenti
[normal]ng classics the BBC
[normal] is quite dishonest, ‘interpreting’ them 
[normal]in ways that are quite foreign to the int
[normal]entions of the authors. In
[normal] 
[normal]The L
[normal]ion the Witch and the Wardrobe
[normal] Mr Beaver was carping and rude about Mrs Beaver’s cooking (little boys learn how to be carpi
[normal]ng and rude to their mothers and future wives). In 
[normal]Sherlock Holmes
[normal] I was shocked to hear the following, bad tempered, reply to some young children who understood that the dead went to heaven: “Of course dead people do not go to heaven. They get put into a 
[normal]little wooden box and burned”
[normal] (there is no such thing as a happy afterlife, religion is bosh; violence is the only reality)
[normal]. 
[normal] The recent 
[normal]Father Brown 
[normal]series was a travesty, and typical of the way the BBC now distorts famous names to 
[normal]present its
[normal] own 
[normal]agenda and 
[normal]cultural values
[normal] – which are those of anti religion
[normal] (religion falsely portrayed), 
[normal]sex and violence
[normal].
[normal]              
[normal]Yes, the BBC is dishonest - in giving us biased versions of the news that will sustain a culture of anti religion, sex and violence. People, who 
[normal]were not black, it was said, did not notice the racialist attitudes that were endemic in society. 
[normal]People who are not Catholic do not notice the on going anti Catholic attitudes in the BBC. It can be very subtle or quite blatant. I was amazed recently 
[normal]to he
[normal]ar a 
[normal]good
[normal] report about a Catholic priest (he had done a lot to bring together the warring factions in Northern Ireland) instead of endless reports about their bad deeds. Yes, there are priests who do a lot of good but we do not hear about them. 
[normal]              
[normal]This anti
[normal] religion attitude of the BBC and its biased reporting of events is tied up with its other cultural values. In January every year in Washington
[normal], D.C.
[normal] 
[normal]there is a huge pro-life walk. At the latest t
[normal]here were about 600,
[normal]000 demonstrators
[normal]. Do
[normal] we hear about it o
[normal]n the BBC news? 
[normal]The BBC reports on stem cell
[normal] research not differentiating between
[normal] research that uses - and destroys in the process - human embryos, and the use of adult stem cells.  The former, using embryos, of course, the Catholic Church holds as gravely
[normal] immoral, and it is research that has given rise to no useful treatments but in fact has proved to be dangerous
[normal],
[normal] embryonic stem cells
[normal] being uncontrollable. Adult stem cell treatments have proved very us
[normal]eful indeed and are used in 
[normal]more than a hundred differ
[normal]ent conditions. The Catholic Church 
[normal]unjustly 
[normal]is made out to be anti science because it is against the destruction of human embryos
[normal] as the source of stem cells
[normal].
[normal]              
[normal]Pro-life marches and adult stem cell research, of course, hinder licentious attitudes towards h
[normal]uman
[normal] beings and human
[normal] sexual behaviour and violence towards the products of conception
[normal] (
[normal]babies – women are just ‘pregnant’ these days, not ‘with child’)
[normal]. 
[normal]              
[normal]Since religion has a great influence on culture (we have only to look at the universities founded by
[normal] the Church in the Middle Ages, the great cathedrals, the poems of Dante and the art of Michaelangelo, for example, to see this)
[normal],
[normal] an anti religious attitude profoundly affects culture and cultural values.  The BBC has no right to denigrate the faith and cu
[normal]lture, particularly of 
[normal]our Christian heritage, 
[normal]especially 
[normal]where
[normal] people of faith 
[normal]are obliged 
[normal]to pay for this 
[normal]denigration 
[normal]with their licence fee, the BBC
[normal] thinking they are doing such people a great
[normal] favour by allowing them
[normal] the few hours of religious broadcast
[normal]ing (continuously under threat from the secular section, which greatly dominates the media already
[normal]) that remain to them. Religion affects people’s values, morals, the stability of marriage and the family, and people’s respect for each other. 
[normal]Religion affec
[normal]ts culture:
[normal] c
[normal]ulture affects citizenship
[normal].
[normal] We have seen that the BBC promotes a
[normal]n anti religious
[normal] culture of sexual licence and violence
[normal] that is against good citizenship
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The BBC is a very large organisation, having different departments, and the behaviour I 
[normal]have just outlined does not typify them all, as I have indicated. The Radio 3 programmes are by and large educational, enjoyable and su
[normal]stain a responsible culture,
[normal] 
[normal]but 
[normal]such departments are in the minority.
[normal]              
[normal]Summing Up.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is important, it seems to me, to have a national broadcasting system funded by the people that like government, under God, is of the people, by the people and for the people. I am not against a system funded by a licence fee, it could be used to the gre
[normal]at good of the nation because it is highly influential in forming the cultural values of society. As it is, large parts of the BBC are running amok.
