"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSupplementary written evidence submitted by the Rt Hon Gregory Barker MP, DECC (HOT0062)&#xa0;\nI would like to thank you for inviting me to speak to the Energy &amp;\n Climate Change Committee on Tuesday. I hope you found the information that my officials and I provided helpful. I recognise that on a number of occasions, we could not give you answers in full and undertook to write to you. Having gone through the officia\nl record, I hope that the following further information fulfils that commitment. Please do let us know if there is any further information you require. \nRegulations on Heating ControlsThe Standard Assessment Procedure for demonstrating compliance with Bui\nlding Regulations currently do effectively penalise the construction of a new home without appropriate heating controls – one part of the model adjusts the internal temperature and/or   assumed efficiency of the heating system in line with the effectivenes\ns of the control system. \nSimilarly on the installation of a full new heating system in an existing dwelling there is a requirement under Part L of the Building Regulations that reasonable provision is made for the installation of effective controls includ\ning timer, room thermostat and TRVs.\nIn our Energy Efficiency Strategy we announced a programme to assess the potential of smarter heating controls to reduce domestic energy demand. The evidence base is currently mixed on the issue of the extent to which s\nmarter heating controls reduce energy consumption. It suggests further development is needed to meet user requirements of different groups. DECC have recently published new research to test the usability of five currently available Smarter Heating Controls\n. The findings, published in full on the gov.uk website, highlight the need for further innovation in heating control design and usability.\nThe next stage of the Smarter Heating Controls research programme will be to work closely with industry leads on how\n new products can be improved and to develop further evidence on whether they reduce energy c\nonsumption.\nGreen Deal Application in Devolved AreasThe Green Deal offer is the same across the constituent nations of the UK. However, there were some difference\ns in delivery in Scotland:\nWe collect statistics around the UK for Green Deal \nand\n ECO uptake, as set out below:\n&#xa0;\nGreen Deal&#xa0;\nCountry\nGreen Deal Assessments\nPercentage of Assessments\nTotal number of Cashback \nvouchers paid\n Valid percentage of Cashback vouchers paid\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nGreat Britain44,479100&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nEngland\n41,092\n92\n3,093\n93\n&#xa0;\nWales\n2,085\n5\n219\n7\n&#xa0;\nScotland\n1,302\n3\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nEnergy Company Obligation&#xa0;\nObligation Area\nCountry\nCarbon\n Saving Target (CSO)\nCarbon Savings Community (CSCO)\nAffordable Warmth (HHCRO)\nTotal number of ECO measures delivered \nValid percentage of ECO measures delivered\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nGreat Britain46,05949,53054,092149,681100England\n38,931\n44,045\n44,089\n127,065\n85\nWales\n1,826\n2,269\n3,828\n7,923\n5\nScotland\n5,282\n3,216\n6,118\n14,616\n10\nTotal unique properties37,94445,67850,833134,133&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nRegulatory Approaches around UKThe different regulatory regimes for buildings across the UK are set out in the following legislation: \n&#xa0;\nSAP Treatment of Thermal MassThermal mass is incorporated into SAP via a ‘thermal mass parameter’, which is the summation of the heat capacity of the surfaces in contact with th\ne internal air divided by the total floor area.\nIt influences the result in two ways:\nFirst, greater mass leads to better utilisation of solar gains, particularly when received outside heating periods, since the walls and other surfaces can store heat.\nSec\nondly, it also means that the internal temperature drops less rapidly when the heating is off. \nThese effects act in opposite directions.  The first leads to a reduction in the energy demand to be supplied by the heating system as thermal mass increased, w\nhile the second leads to an increase because of higher internal temperature averaged over 24 hours and thus the potential for greater heat loss depending on the insulation levels. \nFor dwellings with poor or moderate insulation levels, the latter has the g\nreater effect, so that higher mass tends to give a higher space heating energy requirement. For high insulation levels, particularly if coupled with passive solar design, the former can have the greater effect, with higher mass giving a lower energy requir\nement.\nWork of the Heat Network Delivery UnitDuring the first round of bids for the Heat Networks Delivery Unit’s grant support programmes, a total of 131 requests for application forms were received from 84 Local Authorities. This led to 31 Local Authori\nties submitting completing applications relating to 53 separate projects. \nThese projects have been assessed by the department against value for money and other published criteria \nand the\n Secretary of State is expected to make a formal announcement regardi\nng payment of the grants in January 2014.\nThe second round of the grant support programme was opened on 27\nth\n November\n, with\n a deadline for applications of  31\nst\n January. We are happy to keep the Committee updated as to the progress being made.\nVentilation \nThe Green Deal incorporates robust procedures to ensure that work is done by competent installers and in accordance with all relevant requirements of the Building Regulations including Part F Means of ventilation and Part J Combustion appliances.\nFor exis\nting properties, the Green Deal Code of Practice states that where a package of improvements is proposed to be installed under a Green Deal Plan, it is the responsibility of the Green Deal Provider to ensure that the products installed are properly integra\nted with each other and with any previously installed energy efficiency measures in order to minimise the risk of damage to the building fabric as a consequence of inadequate ventilation or inadequate air tightness, particularly where the installed measure\ns include internal or external solid wall insulation systems, cavity wall insulation or replacement or secondary glazing.  \nFor new build, Part F of Building Regulations requires an appropriate ventilation strategy, taking into account the requirements for\n conservation of fuel and energy (and thus the need for air tightness) set out in Part L of Building Regulations. Part L of Building Regulations in turn also takes account of the energy impact of any mechanical or natural ventilation system required under \nPart F.\n&#xa0;\nHeat Pump Bill SavingsThrough their heat pump field trial, EST has provided the main source of evidence on in-situ performance of heat pumps in the UK.\n&#xa0;\n Phase 1 of the field trial measured 83 systems mainly installed in 2008.\n&#xa0;\n DECC analysed these\n results in detail and published a report, which is available on our website:\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publication\ns/analysis-from-the-first-phase-of-the-energy-saving-trust-s-heat-pump-field-trial\nThese results were disappointing but they have been used constructively by DECC and industry to develop improved heat pump installation standards, which have been in plac\ne since April 2012.\nEST’s field trial continued for a second phase with a reduced sample size after interventions had taken place.\n&#xa0;\n DECC’s detailed analysis of these results are available on \nthe same webpage.\n&#xa0;\n They generally show significant improvements w\nhere interventions have been made.\nMore recently, DECC have been running a new metering programme in the Renewable Heat Premium Payment.\n&#xa0;\n The sample size of this field trial is significantly larger than EST’s (approximately 700 systems) but the data collec\ntion exercise will not conclude until October 2014.\nIt is not straightforward to match up metered sites with their previous heating fuel, make assumptions about the metered person’s previous system’s efficiency, heating energy consumption and fuel prices a\nnd produce an estimate of bill savings.\n&#xa0;\n However, by making reasonable assumptions, we should be able to present our new data in a way that estimates the proportion of installations that reduced the occupants’ heating bills.\nWe intend to publish a short re\nport in January showing examples of the data we are collecting in the RHPP metering programme.\n&#xa0;\n In that report we can also include an assessment of the Seasonal Performance Factors required to generate fuel bill savings in different scenarios under particu\nlar assumptions.\nGas Network Strategy GroupThe Department continues to engage with stakeholders. At the moment we are unsure what value a formal Gas Network Strategy Group would add to the conversations and engagement already taking place. However we will\n continue to consider the option and have no objection to a \ngroup being formed if it would add significant value to the process.\nWhole Systems Approach and Integration across Government  \nDECC’s Whole Energy System work is an overarching programme that int\negrates two projects considering electricity system topics and multi-vector challenges (e.g. future of the gas grid, role of hydrogen).\n&#xa0;\n The work is focused on delivering answers to key policy questions from a position that takes in the entire energy syste\nm under a number of scenarios out to 2050. The team is working with key external centres of energy system expertise, including UCL’s Energy Institute, the Energy Technology Institute and National Grid in order to understand what system thinking and modelli\nng is already being undertaken. \n&#xa0;\nEach workstream takes a structured approach to scope potential issues and current practice before defining what capabilities will be required to shape the future decarbonised energy system.\n&#xa0;\n By verifying and building on exi\nsting system modelling capabilities, it will help DECC deliver a fit for purpose energy system at the lowest cost to tax payers.\nThe programme will work with a Whole Systems Modelling Expert Panel containing advisers from a range of other Government depart\nments as well as industry and academia. In this way, we plan to capture insights from all perspectives on the energy system.\nI hope that fulfils our commitment to follow up on those questions in writing. In addition, I would also like to draw your attentio\nn to two minor factual inaccuracies in our\n \nresponses to your questions:\n&#xa0;\nIn addition, we have publ\nished new data on off-gas-grid households since the hearing, which you may find useful. You can find it at \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/\nsystem/uploads/attachment_data/file/266468/off_gas_grid.pdf\n.\nI hope you found these responses helpful. I look forward to the publication of your report.\n.\nDecemeber 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
