[[[Introduction]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;4.1.&#xa0; how to protect public services and continue to reduce the deficit; 4.2.&#xa0; how to ensure economic growth up and down the country; 4.3.&#xa0; how to revitalise local democracy; and 4.4.&#xa0; how to manage the contrasts between people’s experience of devolution in Scotland and Wales in the absence of an equivalent deal for England.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Summary ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;11.1. Place-based finance that provides areas with greater control over their tax, spending and borrowing, allowing a stronger focus on the needs of both local people and the local economy;11.2. Fair, transparent and certain distribution of local government finance led by local government, which could be extended to the funding for other public services;11.3. Five year funding settlements for local public services, providing certainty and the basis for greater service integration, early intervention and investment in growth;11.4. Scrapping the Barnett Formula for allocating funding to the devolved nations, and investing in preventative public services that reduce demand on, more expensive, acute services.&#xa0;

[[[undations for fiscal devolution]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;29.1. Giving local government full control over council tax rates and discounts and removing requirements for referendums;&#xa0;29.2. The full localisation of business rates which, if it took place, would mean local government could be self-funding in 2018-19 when the totality of business rates and council tax exceeds the current funding projections;&#xa0;29.3. Removing the centrally set Housing Revenue Account borrowing cap, allowing councils to build homes to full capacity. We estimate this could result in up to an additional 60,000 new homes over the next five years. Furthermore reforming the classification of council borrowing for housing would bring the UK into line with Europe in the way it classifies this kind of borrowing and end the preoccupation with where the borrowing sits for accounting purposes, rather than the value attained for the investment. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;33.1. employment support where the re-tender of the Work Programme in 2016 provides an opportunity for co-commissioning between local government and the Department of Work and Pensions or a transfer of commissioning responsibility;&#xa0;33.2. a transfer of responsibility for vocational skills, so that provision can be shaped to fit the needs of the local economy and skills mismatches can be corrected, such as training 94,000 people in hair and beauty for 18,000 vacancies nationally;&#xa0;33.3. a new local approach to engaging young people aged between 16 and 25 years in work and learning that substitutes more successful local programmes for the plethora of less successful national programmes; and&#xa0;33.4. local decisions about the investment in roads, bringing the Highways Agency under local control.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;37.1. sharing money fairly around England by taking financial distribution out of the hands of Ministers and replacing it with an agreement across English local government. The current arrangements for funding local government are opaque and subject to change with each new national government. We need a fairer, more transparent and stable system for providing grant to local government based on needs and costs;&#xa0;37.2. wider revenue raising powers including the ability to levy local tourist taxes, reducing the dependence on council tax and business rates and allowing areas the ability to reduce the tax burden on local taxpayers;&#xa0;37.3. five year funding settlements across the public sector that provide more certainty and allow local partners to commit to joint investment and commissioning; and&#xa0;37.4. the development of a market in municipal bonds that gives local government access to alternative forms of finance at more competitive rates than the Public Works Loans Board. The LGA is already undertaking feasibility work on this proposal.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
