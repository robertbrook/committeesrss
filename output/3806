defaultSupplementary evidence defaultfromdefault Rt Hon Alun Michael JP, defaultPolice and Crime defaultCommissioner for South WalesdefaultI am writing to provide supplementary evidence to the oral evidence I gave to the Justice 
defaultSelect Committee on the 11
defaultth
default September and I hope your colleagues will find this helpful.
defaultI very much welcome the Committee's inquiry into the co-ordination of crime reduction 
defaultpolicies. I have argued for many years now that all agencies need to take a partnership 
defaultapproach to crime reduction which is why I introduced Crime Reduction Partnerships as a 
defaultkey element in what became the 1998 Crime and Disorder Act, which I will expand on later. 
defaultIn my view one of the missing links in the system for ensuring a co-orientated approach to 
defaultcrime reduction is to ensure that the courts have a duty to pay full attention to "what works" 
defaultin reducing the likelihood 
defaultanddefault defaultthe seriousness of re-offending. At their best, the police do 
defaultserve the clear policing objective set down by Sir Robert Peel that the first duty of the police 
defaultis to prevent crime and disorder — though that cannot be done in isolation, and many of the levers in preventing crime fall outside of the hands of the police so partnership working is the 
defaultonly way forward.
defaultStrides have been made in working collaboratively with local authorities in particular, and the 
defaultNHS is another crucial partner. While there is still a long way to go, we are moving forward on that journey. I am concerned, however, that there simply hasn't been the same progress in our courts. For example, for some years I have argued that we should be much clearer 
defaultabout 
defaultour 
defaultexpectations of the Criminal Justice System as a whole. You will recall that I 
defaultmoved amendments in the House of Commons when I was a member of your committee 
defaultarguing that the Sentencing Council should be given as its key purpose the responsibility of 
defaultinforming and advising the judiciary (including magistrates) about the effectiveness of 
defaultdifferent sentences in protecting the public through reducing the likelihood of the offender 
defaultreoffending.
defaultThis view is supported by the Ministry of Justice itself which states in its written evidence to
default 
defaultyour Committee that 
default"When passing sentence, the court must have regard to the statutory
default 
defaultpurposes of sentencing, which include the reduction of crime" 
defaultand that regard must be given
default 
defaultto 
default"the cost of different sentences and their relative effectiveness in preventing re-offending... 
defaultUnderstanding what works in reoffending is 
defaulta 
defaultpriority for government.'
defaultA similar view was put forward in the Justice Select Committee's Report on Justice 
defaultReinvestment which says we should be
default:
default"looking to the judiciary to adopt an active role within local criminal justice boards so that the
defaulty
default 
defaultbetter understand the outcomes of their sentencing decisions, and are enabled to draw lessons from what happens to those they sentence; judges and magistrates should be 
defaultencouraged to work closer with criminal justice agencies as has been proved successful in community, and drug and alcohol, court initiatives
defaultand identifies that a holistic approach to reform is necessary 
default"with a very clear and explicit 
defaultstatement of the purpose of the whole system against which organisational aims can be 
defaulttested to assess their contribution to cutting the extent and seriousness of offending and 
defaultreoffending.
default”
defaultBut this message still doesn't seem to be adopted by the judiciary. Recently I asked the 
defaultchairman of the Sentencing Council, Lord Leveson, when he agreed that there was a need 
defaultto put more emphasis on informing the courts about "what works" in making offenders less 
defaultlikely to offend again, and he responded rather bizarrely by saying that we needed to ask 
defaultthat question of community sentences but not of prison sentences. Again, this is complete 
defaultcontrast to the challenge laid down by the Select Committee in 2009 that 
default"the role of the 
defaultSentencing Council 
defaultshould
default.
default be 
defaultto ensure that sentencing practice succeeds in reducing 
defaultoffending and re-offending"' 
defaultIt's encouraging that services like probation and the prisons are 
defaultkeen to work with us and very positive about the help they get from services like education, 
defaulttraining and health that come under Welsh Government.
defaultIt is important to be mindful that the context in Wales is different to that in England. In Wales 
defaultmany of the levers used in crime reduction fall within the remit of the Welsh Government 
defaultsuch as housing, health and education.
default&#xa0;
defaultAnd the Welsh Government has taken its role very seriously. Welsh Ministers have provided 
defaultus with
default 
default500 additional Community Support Officers to work with local communities to reduce 
defaultcrime; they are introducing the world's first legislation specifically targeting preventing 
defaultviolence against women; and they have provided grant funding for an innovative Community 
defaultSpeedwatch project in South Wales to target speeding in the most socio-economically 
defaultdeprived areas. They are also taking a lead role in collaborative working encouraging Local 
defaultGovernment to work on a footprint model, for example in South Wales there is a project 
defaultunderway to merge Bridgend, Swansea and Neath Port Talbot's youth services to share
default 
defaultresilience and best practice across the region.
default&#xa0;
defaultWelsh Government ha
defaults
default also sought to engage Commissioners and the four Welsh Police 
defaultand Crime Commissioners meet ministers regularly. Also, I currently sit on both the Reform 
defaultDelivery Group, and t
defaulthe Finance Sub-Group working in 
defaultpartnership with Ministers and Local 
defaultGovernment leaders to develop a response to current challenges. These are opportunities 
defaultnot afforded to my counterparts on the other side of Offa's Dyke.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, much as I applaud national commitment to crime reduction, it cannot just be done 
defaultnationally. A national strategy for crime reduction will only work as an aggregation of local 
defaultaction and with an understanding of the local context.
default&#xa0;
defaultOne of the key partnerships in reducing crime is the health service, and I take a victim-
defaultcentred approach seeing crime as a public health problem — both in terms of reducing 
defaultvictims who suffer visible injuries as a result of a violent crime, as well as the psychological impact on victims who may have suffered from the effects of long term anti-social behaviour, 
defaultfor example. I have attached an essay I wrote earlier in the year which outlines the approach 
default&#xa0;
defaultI am taking and the ways in which I am working with partners.
default 
defaultI am also working more widely with partners across South Wales to reduce crime through 
defaultSafer South Wales — a board which meets quarterly and brings together the Police with local 
defaultcouncils, Youth Offending Team managers, Probation, the Ambulance and Fire services and 
defaultHealth Board representatives. This gives us a broad range of perspectives to share 
defaultconcerns and work together on a co-ordinated approach. For more specialised issues on 
defaultcriminal justice matters, I have reconstituted the South Wales Criminal Justice Board 
defaultbringing together strategic leads from the Criminal Justice Agencies to work towards a more 
defaultefficient and effective system and increase confidence in the system in South Wales. I also 
defaultmeet the Safer South Wales Action group — a more practitioner led group which co-ordinates 
defaultthe delivery of strategy from Safer South Wales across the force area.
default&#xa0;
defaultThese issues are central to my Police and Crime (Reduction) Plan — I have included 
defaultReduction in the title of my plan, though it is not prescribed in the legislation as I believe this is what should be at the core of everything we do. Prior to becoming an MP, as you know I 
defaultwas a youth worker in some of the most deprived areas of Cardiff and worked with young 
defaultoffenders as well as chairing the (then) City Juvenile Bench. I saw the impact that youth 
defaultoffending had not only on the victims of crime, but on the future of the offenders themselves 
defaultwho became weighted down with criminal records before they even finished school. That is 
defaultwhy I established Youth Offending Teams in the 1998 Crime and Disorder Act which have 
defaultbeen hugely successful in reducing offending. The upper age limit of 18 was there simply 
defaultbecause it made sense to tackle offending at a young age rather than being a fixed ceiling. I 
defaulthave therefore made it a priority in my Plan not only to continue working on tackling youth 
defaultoffending, but to extend this to the 18-25 age group.
default&#xa0;
defaultH
defaultaving said that, it is vital that at the heart of all of my work on crime reduction are victims of 
defaultcrime — and witnesses of crime who often themselves feel victimised. When the Justice Select Committee inquired into the needs of victims, I asked the then Chief Executive of 
defaultVictim Support to summarise what victims want and need. She answered that what victims 
defaultwant, more than anything else (other than not to have become a victim in the first place) is to know that it's not going to happen again
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe need to make sure that victims are treated properly within the criminal justice system. Going to court is too, often an experience of re-victimisation, and that must change. But it is 
defaultalso imperative that we prevent offending, reoffending and re-victimisation — prevention here 
defaultis most definitely better than cure.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe police role is vital - not on their own, but as part of the team with other agencies. 
defaultVictims need to see the police as being "on their side" and I strongly support my Chief 
defaultConstable's commitment to improving victim satisfaction with the police response to crime 
defaultand anti-social behaviour.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis was my philosophy in the development of the 1998 Crime and Disorder Act, not only 
defaultintroducing local partnerships and evidence based policing in Youth Offending Teams but 
defaultextending this into wider community safety through Crime Reduction Partnerships renamed 
default"Community Safety Partnerships" in Wales - which have quietly and effectively beavered 
defaultaway at making the public safer in our communities bringing together the Police, Probation, Fire and Health services with Local Authorities at a local level. This should be a cross party 
defaultmantra because these principles were reinforced in the 2011 Police and Social 
defaultResponsibility Act and in the role of Police and Crime Commissioners.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt's worked across England and Wales, but I suggest that it has worked particularly well in 
defaultSouth Wales because it fits with the nature of strong local communities and the style of police leadership in recent times. We've also seen strong collaboration between the four 
defaultWelsh chief constables and their teams, providing a healthy precursor for the arrival of 
defaultcommissioners with the same combination of being both independent in spirit and 
defaultcollaborative in practical matters. And that's been helped by the style of Government in 
defaultWales, with the emphasis on a "public health" approach and on protecting services and 
defaultcollaborative working.
default&#xa0;
defaultAnother key success of the 1998 Act was the Anti-social Behaviour Order — more commonly 
defaultknown as the ASBO. This arose from widespread public concern with low-level antisocial behaviour and not just with serious crime. Thankfully few people are directly affected by 
defaulthomicide but large numbers of people in South Wales know about litter and graffiti and noise 
defaultnuisance and the trauma of living next to the "neighbours from hell
default.
default”
default&#xa0;
defaultAnd we also recognised the complexity of the public response to crime and disorder. During 
defaultdozens of meetings on run-down estates up and down the country I heard the authentic 
defaultvoice of local anger about local youngsters being out of control, only for the same person to 
defaultsay later in the meeting ".... and there's nothing for the kids to do around here". Many of 
defaultthose who most passionately asked us to be "tough on crime" also demanded action to 
default"tackle the causes of crime".
default&#xa0;
defaultI had never intended for the order to be used against young people who do not have a well 
defaultdeveloped sense of risk — and the high breach rate amongst young people, one of the 
defaultjustifications being used by the current Government to scrap the ASBO, supports my view 
defaultthat these types of orders just don't work for that age group. They were intended for adults and indeed the Act itself applied the ASBO only to adults.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe reason that the ASBO worked well is that whilst the Criminal Justice System is very 
defaultgood at looking a
defaultt a
default snapshot of a single event, it is not very good at dealing with the moving picture of low-level crimes which can have a real impact on quality of life, both for individuals and communities. That's why I believe there is still a key role for the ASBO in tackling crime.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt was introduced as a civil order, which meant that professional witnesses could be used in 
defaultcourt, for example Housing Officers, Community workers, and Police Officers. As intended, 
defaultthat protects victims from any negative repercussions from offenders and makes early 
defaultintervention more likely. A breach of the Order would then be considered a criminal offence 
defaultand be subject to the higher burden of proof, and the offender arrested as a deterrent.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe involvement of housing authorities and local authorities as well as the police was 
defaultanother recognition that crime reduction isn't something the police can deal with in isolation.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe figures show that most anti-social behaviour stops following a letter or some alert from 
defaultan authority that they are committing anti-social behaviour (65% after the first intervention, 86% after two and 93% by the third intervention). I think there is a good case for intervening 
defaultat the start — making people aware that they are causing a problem before neighbourhood relations deteriorate — and using community mediation to let offenders hear how their actions 
defaultare impacting on the lives of others. That's the way to enable people to escape from even 
defaultgetting an order or an injunction against them. Such an approach has benefits socially, 
defaultenvironmentally and financially, and it works.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, I also think that we need some form of deterrent. That was why I thought, and still 
defaultthink, it is vital there is the threat of arrest, a criminal prosecution and potentially even jail for 
defaultserious breaches. Our police tell me that these orders are being used to manage offenders 
defaultwithin the community, through the threat that if they do not comply they are liable to have the 
defaultpolice come knocking. Nationally, changes of direction are damaging to local work and local
default 
defaultaccountability and retard partnerships and working patterns developed over a number of 
defaultyears.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis all links back to the findings of the Justice Reinvestment report by the Justice Select 
defaultCommittee that a number of the levers which affect crime and anti-social behaviour fall 
defaultoutside of the criminal justice system'. A co-ordinated partnership approach is the only way 
defaultto ensure effective crime prevention, and I very much welcome the inquiry by the Select Committee in this area because it is an approach that works.
default&#xa0;
defaultI welcome the Ministry's commitment to providing up to 12 months support for all offenders —
defaultincluding those who have served less than 12 months. But this work needs resources and 
defaultstability and efforts need to be made to ensure this is a truly joined up approach. Drug and 
defaultalcohol intervention, mental health issues, housing services, education and training, 
defaultcounselling and relationship services are all important if the cycle of offending is to be 
defaultbroken. As a local prison governor said to me, it's about making sure on release someone 
defaultturns left to local services, instead of right to the nearest pub.
default&#xa0;
defaultI have heard too many times from prisoners and ex-prisoners that they are better off inside with routine, hot meals and a bed than on the outside. It's shocking that only one third of 
defaultprisoners reported being in paid employment in the 4 weeks before custody, that 13% 
defaultreported never having had a job, 15% were homeless before custody and 25% were 
defaultsuffering from anxiety and depression
defaultv
default.
default 
defaultThat simply isn't right.
default&#xa0;
defaultAgainst this background the forthcoming changes to the Probation Service as well as the 
defaultshift in legislation to tackle anti-social behaviour are deeply worrying. These changes 
defaultthreaten to tear up partnerships and creating a great deal of uncertainty in the sector fuelled 
defaultby a lack of evidence from pilots — which were cancelled in Wales. Mr Richard Johnson told 
defaultthe Committee on 2 July 2013 that if you want the system to work, you would attach funding 
defaultdirectly to an individual that would otherwise go to probation, prisons, police, health, 
defaultemployment and housing to ensure a co-ordinated approach. The worst possible outcome 
defaultwould be a silo mentality with each service only interested in their bit of the puzzle. Ironically 
defaultthere is a better level of collaboration now than for many -years. We can only hope that will survive the current round of changes.
default&#xa0;
defaultAnd Justice cannot be totally divorced from Social Justice. Police and Local Government 
defaultface hugely reduced budgets as are partner agencies and third sector organisations and 
defaultmeanwhile welfare reforms are reducing the support available to people in our poorest 
defaultcommunities. Pushing people to such dire situations can only result in an increase in 
defaultadditional pressure on services later on. It makes early intervention even more difficult at the 
defaultvery time when we need to create head room for services. Prisons and police cells should 
defaultnot be used as a backstop where other agencies have failed.
default&#xa0;
defaultI 
defaultam pleased to say that unlike some past periods of financial crisis, when there was a 
defaulttendency to withdraw into "core services", many public bodies fully appreciate that only joint 
defaultworking can bring about more effective preventative work and improved standards of 
defaultdelivery. Strategic demands from government, the service demands of the end user, and 
defaulteffectiveness in serving the public all require a more joined-up approach in order to enable each part of the public sector to do more with less while coping with the effects of fundin
defaultg 
defaultcuts.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis approach is actually supported in 
defaultrelation to community safety by 
defaultboth the 1998 Crime 
defaultand Disorder Act, and the 2011 P
defaultolice and Social Responsibility 
defaultAct.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 1998 Act states:
default&#xa0;
default"Section 17: Duty to consider crime and disorder implications.
default(1)Without prejudice to any other obligation imposed on it, it shall be the duty 
defaultof each authority to which this section applies to exercise its various functions 
defaultwith 
defaultdue regard to the likely effect of the exercise of those functions on, defaultand the need to do all that it reasonably can to prevent, crime and defaultdisorder in its area."defaultThe 2011 Act reaffirms this, and includes a specific reference to the Police and Crime 
defaultCommissioner's responsibilities with regards to partnership working and engagement with 
defaultthe Criminal Justice System:
default1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Police &amp; Crime Commissioner must, in exercising his functions, have regard to 
defaultthe relevant priorities of each responsible authority.
default2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Commissioner, in exercising his functions, and a 
defaultresponsible authority, defaultin 
defaultexercising its functions conferred by or under section 6 of the Crime and Disorder Act 
default1998 in relation to that police area, 
defaultmust act in co-operation with each other.default3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Commissioner, and 
defaultthe criminal justice bodies defaultwhich exercise functions as 
defaultcriminal justice bodies in that police area, must make arrangements (so far as it is appropriate to do so) for the exercise of functions so as to provide 
defaultan efficient and defaulteffective criminal justice system for the police area.defaultThis is reinstated by the Commissioner's Oath of Office, which unlike the oath on becoming 
defaultan MP pledges to serve the people living within the force area, and specifically spells out 
defaultwhat the responsibilities of the Commissioner are, as follows:
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultI will serve all the people of South Wales in the office of Police and Crime 
defaultCommissioner.
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultI will act with integrity and diligence in my role and, to the best of my ability, 
defaultwill execute the duties of my office to ensure that the police are able to cut 
defaultcrime and protect the public.
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultI will give a voice to the public, especially victims of crime, and work with other
defaultservices to ensure the safety of the community and effective criminal justice.
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultI will take all steps within my power to ensure transparency of my decisions, 
defaultso that I may be properly held to account by the public.
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultI will not interfere with the operational independence of police officers.
defaultThis is a very powerful set of requirements and I often use it when explaining the role of the 
defaultCommissioner, not just to external organisations but also to the force and Chief Officers to 
defaultshow that I have to have regard to all those factors which affect crime prevention and 
defaultreduction. Part of this remit, explicitly, is ensuring an 
defaulteffective and efficient defaultcriminal justice 
defaultsystem.
defaultAnother approach which I have taken as the cornerstone of my work are Peel's 9 principles 
defaultfor policing:
default1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe basic mission for which the police exist is to prevent crime and disorder.
default2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe ability of the police to perform their duties is dependent upon the public 
defaultapproval of police actions.
default3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPolice must secure the willing co-operation of the public in voluntary 
defaultobservation of the law to be able to secure and maintain the respect of the 
defaultpublic.
default4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe degree of co-operation of the public that can be secured diminishes 
defaultproportionately to the necessity of the use of physical force.
default5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPolice seek and preserve public favour not by catering to public opinion, but 
defaultby constantly demonstrating absolute impartial service to the law.
default6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPolice use physical force to the extent necessary to secure observance of the 
defaultlaw or to restore order only when the exercise of persuasion, advice, and 
defaultwarning is found to be insufficient.
default7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPolice, at all times, should maintain a relationship with the public that gives 
defaultreality to the historic tradition that the police are the public and the public are 
defaultthe police; the police being only members of the public who are paid to give full-time attention to duties which are incumbent upon every citizen in the 
defaultinterests of community welfare and existence.
default8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPolice should always direct their action strictly towards their functions, and 
defaultnever appear to usurp the powers of the judiciary.
default9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe test of police efficiency is the absence of crime and disorder, not the 
defaultvisible evidence of police action in dealing with it
default&#xa0;
defaultAlthough these nine principles have stood the test of time, I believe a 10
defaultth
default principle needs to 
defaultbe added to follow on from this to recognise that perception and reality are not the same. 
defaultWhen the public are bombarded with "bad news stories" it is not surprising that the fear of 
defaultcrime is often greater than the reality. My suggested 10
defaultth
default principle would be:
default"Understand the real levels of crime, not just what is reported, and defaultshare this knowledge with the public to reduce the fear of crime."defaultAs well as the communications challenge this presents, there is a need to understand the 
defaulttrue levels of crime rather than depending just on what is reported to the police. You will be 
defaultaware of the work of Professor Jonathan Shepherd in Cardiff who has worked scientifically 
defaultto help the police and the council to drastically reduce levels of city centre violence through 
defaultanalysis of the experience of victims presenting at A&amp;E.
defaultIn the 1990s police, councillors and media alike knew that violence was random and 
defaultunpredictable in Cardiff City Centre. Police and NHS and others had to wait to see what 
defaulthappened and react. The first results of the analysis of A&amp;E Data showed that this was 
defaultsimply untrue. Violence was concentrated quite disproportionately in a small number of 
defaultlocations. That information led to prophylactic deployment of police, discussions with 
defaultrelevant licensees, better information for all emergency services and a significant drop in 
defaultviolent incidents. Analysis of injuries led to the use of toughened glass and a reduction in the 
defaultseriousness of many offences.
defaultInformation can be anonymised and used to target resources by time and location to prevent 
defaultfurther violence. We are applying that sort of analytic approach to other manifestations of 
defaultviolence and indeed other aspects of crime.
defaultIn these circumstances a focus on evidence (of need and of "what works") is essential to 
defaultidentifying the most efficient course of action and the most effective partnership approach. 
defaultReduction of pressure on partners is itself a tangible benefit, as is the cut in the number of 
defaultvictims and the reduction of public fear and concern. It has to be underpinned by the 
defaultprinciple of strategic agreement and tactical delivery.
defaultAt the core of this approach is a need to identify specific local places of concern with regards 
defaultto incidents of violent crime using injury reports from Accident and Emergency units in 
defaultaddition to recorded incidents and police intelligence. Data on "hotspots" of violent incidents 
defaultenables police deployment to target problem areas and cut offending. Better deployment of 
defaultparamedics, ambulances and other emergency services can cut demand so that fewer people become victims of violent crime, fewer people present at A&amp;E and the injuries 
defaultpresented are less serious.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is through these approaches and in partnership with agencies and voluntary groups across South Wales that I am trying to develop a co-ordinated, evidence-based approach to crime 
defaultprevention. This is dependent on building relationships and understanding local needs and 
defaultthe local context which needs to be recognised by Ministers, and by the Treasury. 
defaultConsistent local action can change the national scene, but national action is only truly 
defaulteffective if it empowers effective local action.

default"The Police are the public and the public are the police."
defaultMy second champion is Tony Blair whose approach was famously summed up in a single message

default"We must be Tough on Crime and Tough on the Causes of Crime."
defaultActually, it nearly didn't become famous. Tony became tired of repeating the message, and as his deputy I 
defaulthad to keep reinstating it in one speech after another until a sarcastic comment by Michael Howard (Home 
defaultSecretary at the time) provided the oxygen of media attention and we were able to expound and develop the practical ideas that underpinned the slogan.
defaultWe identified widespread public concern with low-level antisocial behaviour and not just with serious 
defaultcrime. Thankfully few people are directly affected by homicide but large numbers of people in South 
defaultWales know about litter and graffiti and noise nuisance and the trauma of living next to the "neighbours from hell".
defaultAnd we also recognised the complexity of the public response to crime and disorder. During dozens of meetings on run-down estates up and down the country I heard the authentic voice of local anger about 
defaultlocal youngsters being out of control, only for the same person to say later in the meeting ".... and there's 
defaultnothing for the kids to do around here". Many of those who most passionately asked us to be "tough on 
defaultcrime" also demanded action to "tackle the causes of crime". Our "slogan" grew out of listening to local 
defaultexperience.
defaultThe imperative for sophisticated and responsible police leadership became clear after the polarised period of the Miners' Strike, when many Chief Constables sought to re-connect the polic
defaulte with the
default community. 
defaultThey also gave enthusiastic support to the principles of partnership set out in the Crime and Disorder Act 
default1998. Crime and Disorder Partnerships, Youth Offending Teams, the Youth Justice Board and preventative 
defaultinterventions like the Anti-social Behaviour Order have all helped to make a real and lasting impact on 
defaultcrime levels across England and Wales. As Peel rightly said, 
default"the efficiency and effectiveness of the police defaultis proved through the absence of crime and not through the evidence of police action in dealing with defaultcrime".defaultThe most significant statement of evidence-based principles came in December 2009 with a unanimous 
defaultcross-party report from the Justice Select Committee after a major investigation into 
defaultJustice Reinvestment. default"If you had all the money that goes into the Criminal Justice System today, would you spend it in the same 
defaultway
default?" Simp
defaultle answer
default: "No!"
default&#xa0;
defaultIt showed that most of the public policy factors that affect levels of crime and disorder are outside the 
defaulthands of the police and the Criminal Justice System. Education, skills training, jobs, opportunity, housing, 
defaultsubstance misuse, alcohol abuse, mental health and early intervention to "nip things in the bud" 
defaultDOdefault defaultaffect 
defaultcrime levels.
defaultIn particular, mental health is an issue that is raised regularly. Research has shown that 70% of the prison 
defaultpopulation has two or more mental health disorders. So we are failing to identify people with mental 
defaulthealth conditions and failing to get them to the help they need. Individuals with mental health needs 
defaultoften end up in police custody instead of getting the help they need. In contrast the NHS is expected to 
defaulthelp those with other on-going (or even "untreatable") conditions, like diabetes or a heart condition. A 
defaultcrisis for them may result in fast transit to A&amp;E, but not a trip to police cells and that's what needs to 
defaultchange.
defaultSo, if most of the levers are outside the hands of the police, how can a Police &amp; Crime Commissioner make 
defaulta real impact
default?
defaultFor me, it comes down to three
default key approaches

defaultA partnership approach to prevention
defaultHere's what they mean in practice:
defaultA defaultvictim-based approachdefaultWhen the Justice Select Committee enquired into the needs of victims, I asked the then Chief Executive of 
defaultVictim Support to summarise what victims want and need. She answered that what victims want, more 
defaultthan anything else (other than not to have become a victim in the first place) is to know that it's not going 
defaultto happen again.
defaultWe need to make sure that victims are treated properly within the criminal justice system. Going to court 
defaultis too often an experience of re-victimisation, and that must change. But it is also imperative that we 
defaultprevent offending, re-offending and re-victimisation .
defaultThe police role is vital - not on their own, but as part of the team with other agencies. Victims need to see 
defaultthe police as being "on their side" and I strongly support my Chief Constable's commitment to improving 
defaultthe satisfaction of victims with the police response to crime and anti-social behaviour.
defaultRestorative justice too must be victim-centred, enabling the victim's voice to be heard while challenging 
defaultthe offender and tackling the "relational deficit" which is exhibited by so many offenders.
defaultEvidence-based approachdefaultPreparing evidence for the court is central to police professionalism, so it may seem redundant to demand an evidence-based approach to policing. But an evidence-based approach to crime reduction i
defaults different,
default and for a time was not seen as central to the police as a "blue light" service. The "blue light service" of 
defaultreactive policing is essential to the public and central to the role of the police - but it's 
defaultreactive defaultrather than 
defaultpreventative.default&#xa0;
defaultThe "can do" attitude of the police to tackling problems is a great strength. When a problem arises, their 
defaultinstinctive response is "let me take that away and sort it". —However this can be a weakness if the levers of 
defaultpreventative action lie with other people. So the big challenge for a Commissioner is to endorse the 
defaultaction-orientated approach while leading the search for "what works" and taking a clinical approach to 
defaultasking "why does this bad stuff happen?" and bringing about change.
defaultMy passionate belief in the partnership approach comes from a history of working across different 
defaultagencies long before I entered Parliament. I worked with young offenders, I sought to reduce offending 
defaultlocally, I worked in an analytic interagency context as a youth worker and I chaired the city's Juvenile 
defaultBench (as it then was). An "action research" project in the Ely area of Cardiff with a young researcher —
defaultnow Prof Howard Williamson of the University of South Wales made a massive impact on me. Intensive 
defaultwork proved that people in different professions "knew" the area in general, but totally misunderstood the 
defaultdetail at the granular local level. It also proved that a silo approach by agencies and professions is not just 
defaultineffective but totally counter-productive.
defaultEarlier, being involved in a major project on "Working Together for Children and their Families", led by the 
defaultlate great Barbara Kahan, opened my eyes to the ineffectiveness of a great deal of public policy.
defaultWe now have ample proof that an evidence-based approach to partnership works. The Crime and Disorder 
defaultReduction Partnerships required by the 1998 Act (Community Safety Partnerships in Wales) are a clear 
defaultsuccess, although the methodology of audit, evidence collection and analysis has not been as methodical 
defaultas I intended.
defaultThe effectiveness of a rigorous approach is shown by the Cardiff Violence Reduction Programme led by 
defaultProf Jonathan Shepherd of Cardiff University's Medical School. Jonathan approached me in the mid-90s to 
defaultargue that a scientific approach could cut violence significantly. His in-tray for treatment of facial injuries 
defaultfrom car accidents was going down (in number and seriousness) but his in-tray of victims of violence was escalating.
defaultIt's a long story, but analysing incidents which brought victims of violence to A&amp;E led to significant and 
defaultsustained reductions in the number and seriousness of violent incidents. Peer-reviewed published 
defaultevidence puts this beyond doubt. A crucial aspect of my Police and Crime Plan, supported by the Welsh 
defaultHealth Minister, Mark Drakeford AM, is to take a similar baseline approach to all Accident and Emergency 
defaultDepartments across South Wales.
defaultCommitment to partnership and preventative approaches defaultSo an analytic approach is vital and partnership works - provided partnership is much more than different 
defaultprofessionals just feeling comfortable with each other. I am convinced that other aspects of crime will 
defaultrespond to a similar clinical and rigorous approach. That's why partnership needs to permeate all agencies 
defaultand translate into activity on the ground — as happens in the late night triage in Cardiff where health, 
defaultpolice, local authority and Third Sector staff work amazingly well together.
defaultThe benefits are obvious and borne out in the statistics: If police have fewer crimes to deal with, they can 
defaultfocus their limited resources on improving interventions, increasing the sanction-detection levels, 
defaultimproving victim satisfaction and improving engagement with the wider public. That's consistent with Sir Robert Peel's messages. It's good for a surgeon to have fewer cases in his in-tray, for courts to deal with 
defaultfewer cases and subsequently for police officers to be s
defaultpared wasteful hours in court ……. 
defaultand it's good
default for those who do not become victims.
default&#xa0;
defaultI can only speak for South Wales, where the police have pursued this approach for several years and we 
defaulthave the enthusiastic engagement of local councils and others. The 2010 Comprehensive Spending 
defaultReview's severe cuts, compounded now by further cuts, puts this success at risk. Above all, we need to 
defaultavoid what I saw in previous recessions when many agencies retreated into their silo, narrowed their focus 
defaultand reduced interagency cooperation. Certainly in Wales there is good evidence that things are different 
defaultthis time : Welsh Government, local councils and others understand that in tough times you need more 
defaultjoint working, not less.
defaultThat's where the Police and Crime Commissioner can add value.
defaultIf many crime reduction levers are outside the hands of the police, are the police less important as a Force 
defaultand as a Profession? Certainly not
default: The role of police officers is enormously complex, coping with an 
defaultamazing range of demands from local antisocial behaviour to terrorism and extremism, from traffic to the 
defaultnight time economy, from helping vulnerable elderly people to tackling thugs and crooks, and much, much 
defaultmore. Clear operational direction by the chief constable is vital, complemented by the role of the
default 
defaultindividual police officer - a citizen to whom we have given powers to act on behalf of the rest of us.
defaultMinisterial statements and Media headlines about Police and Crime Commissioners talked of "powers" and 
default"holding chief constables to account". That's important, but any interested observer should study the "Commissioners Oath of Office". An MP's oath refers vaguely to serving the Queen as some sort of proxy 
defaultfor public service, whereas the Commissioner's Oath is detailed, complex and specific. It reflects the 
defaultcomplex role of a Commissioner, which in turn reflects the complex role of the police and I have promised 
defaultspecifically to serve the people and communities of South Wales.
defaultThe formal duties of a Commissioner are important, but it's the "and Crime" part of the role that allows an imaginative and enthusiastic Commissioner to make a real impact as a real partner for the Chief Constable, 
defaultmutually challenging but with clear areas of responsibility. The Commissioner can make the connections 
defaultacross public bodies in general and carry out the explicit duty to provide an "efficient and effective criminal 
defaultjustice system" in the local police area. Our leadership is about driving down crime 
defaultand defaultsupporting 
defaultexcellence in policing.
defaultThe way forward is clear — it's through a "public health" approach to policing. The Media portray well the 
defaultexcitement of "blue light" activities in the NHS and in the police, but it's the hidden, painstaking, evidence-based approach to making things better that matter for victims and patients. To put it another way, fewer 
defaultvictims and fewer patient spells success.
defaultThere's just one problem.
defaultFor years I believed that cutting crime would lead to people feeling safer, but that's not how it works. 
defaultWhen I ask public meetings whether the centre of Cardiff is safer or less safe than it was ten years ago, 
defaultmost people say "worse". In fact it's far safer — shown by the reduced number and seriousness of injuries 
defaultthat take victims of violence to A&amp;E.
defaultSo I want to add a "
defaultTenth Principle" to Peel's nine
default:
default&#xa0;
default"We must understand the real levels of crime, not just what is reported, and share this knowledge with the public to reduce the fear of crime".default&#xa0;
defaultAs newspapers struggle to survive, as aspects of social media become shrill and intolerant, and as the 
defaultcacophony of public opinion becomes ever more deafening, it sometimes seems hopeless to argue for 
defaulttrusting the public with the facts. Local residents are a part of the solution, rather than part of the problem. 
defaultChurchill described democracy as the worst form of government, except for all the others that have been 
defaulttried. That applies equally to the public health approach to cutting crime and disorder.
defaultIt won't make headlines, but having been given leadership responsibility by the electorate, that's the direction in which the Police and Crime Commissioner should lead the police and the public.defaultRt Hon Alun Michaeldefault7defaultthdefault September 2013default&#xa0;
