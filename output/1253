[normal]Written evidence submitted by [bold]Siraj[bold] Ahmed [bold]Shaik[bold] (WSC005)[bold]Executive Summary[bold]1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This evidence has a primary focus on computer science, which is an important STEM subject and 
[normal]underpins a large majority of professional roles in the 
[normal]Information Technology (
[normal]IT
[normal]) 
[normal]industry both in private and public sectors. 
[normal]2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Some of the key messages included in this evidence are summarised as follows
[normal]All of the above issues are systematically addressed in dedicated sections 
[normal]below. This is followed by 
[normal]a set of 
[normal]brief 
[normal]recommendations
[normal].
[normal]The final item in this document is 
[normal]a list o
[normal]f references
[normal] that have been 
[normal]consulted 
[normal]for compiling this 
[normal]document. 
[normal]This 
[normal]is important as it serves as a set of surveys, scientific observations an
[normal]d studies, and research contributions, 
[normal]that form the basis of a set of coherent views presented in this document. 
[normal] 
[normal]Author[bold] (and Declaration of Interest)[bold]3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This evidence is submitted in 
[normal]personal capacity by Dr. Siraj Ahmed Shaikh, who is a Reader in the Department of Computing at the Faculty of Engineering and Computing, Coventry University, Coventry, UK. He has been actively involved in teaching and research of computer science for over 
[normal]12 years. He holds a PhD in Computer Science and a MA in Higher and Professional Education. 
[normal]He is a Chartered Scientist (Member of the Science Council) and a Chartered Fellow of the BCS-The Chartered Institute of IT. 
[normal]4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As part of his day-to-day professional
[normal] activities, he works with female colleagues (both senior and junior in rank), and female students (in class room and one-to-one supervisory capacity).
[normal]5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The set of views and opinions presented in this document 
[normal]belong solely to the 
[normal]author and do not represen
[normal]t 
[normal]the views of 
[normal]Coventry University.
[normal]The Image P[bold]roblem[bold]6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]From a philosophical perspective, computer science has been criticised from a feminist perspective and called ‘another masculine science’. The underlying epistemology – the nature of knowledge – for 
[normal]the subject has been shown to be ‘masculinist’ and ‘decontextualised from its objects of study’, attributed with abstraction, reductionism, sacredness and value-freeness. Such 
[normal]characterisations reinforce traditional 
[normal]stereotype of science
[normal] as an exclusive 
[normal]do
[normal]main of male scientists.
[normal] 
[normal]7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]education process does not 
[normal]help the image problem either. 
[normal]The subject is typically aligned with mathematics and e
[normal]ngineering, carrying forward a
[normal] ‘pure’ and ‘masculine’ image as students progress through school and university education. 
[normal]At school, there is some evidence to suggest that there is a 
[normal]general lack of enjoyment of computer use by girls, not helped by a 
[normal]lack of well-trained I
[normal]T teachers an
[normal]d staff. 
[normal]8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A contributing factor is also to do with the associated professional culture
[normal], which in the case of 
[normal]computer science 
[normal]is seen as highly demanding, male dominated, individually isolating, ‘nerdy’ and ‘boring’
[normal]. 
[normal]This 
[normal]do
[normal]es
[normal] not help school girls’ percep
[normal]tion of 
[normal]the 
[normal]IT
[normal] 
[normal]profession 
[normal]who are encouraged to make early career choices in an increasingly competitive world. 
[normal]Confid[bold]ence and S[bold]elf-E[bold]steem[bold]9
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There is 
[normal]evidence of lack of self-belief and confidence 
[normal]in
[normal] female students in their ability to perform 
[normal]and progress 
[normal]in computer science as a subject. 
[normal]Surveys show
[normal] this gap between perceived and actual ability 
[normal]of female students despite being successful in the discipline. 
[normal]The findings include
[normal] 
[normal]that 
[normal]female students are less likely to correct a professor in cla
[normal]ss than their
[normal] male counterparts
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]a 
[normal]lack of self-confidence in software programming abilities in female students
[normal], which lies at the heart of many high-paid
[normal] IT jobs.
[normal]10
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A lack of an adequate number of women is in itself an excluding factor for women from a subject. A critical mass is necessary for a particular subgroup to influence the group it belongs to in any way. In order for women to constructively participate in the
[normal] discourse and reshape gender relations in classrooms, a critical mass of women is necessary among men. Studies have shown, while examining various 
[normal]university 
[normal]departmental characteristics that affect retention of female students, computer science departmen
[normal]ts with a higher number of female students are more likely to retain them
[normal],
[normal] as gender-related perceptions and tensions 
[normal]are less likely to be prevalent. 
[normal] 
[normal]Lack of Role Models[bold]11
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]An aspect of the critical mass factor, which serves as both a cause and a consequen
[normal]ce of it, is the lack of mentoring and female role models in 
[normal]computer science
[normal]. The media coverage of the IT industry moguls, like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs (along with so many others – mostly men), projects an image of a male-dominated profession where wom
[normal]en are either not present at all or their achievements have not been significant. A lack of female role models propagates the masculine image further, one where only geeky, workaholic men, with no family or social responsibilities
[normal] and,
[normal] with an unethical ‘h
[normal]ackers’ mentality can survive
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]12
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he role model process ought to start early for girls, with teachers at schools to act as examples of women working with computers. 
[normal]Surveys on
[normal] 
[normal]gender and computer use in schools
[normal] 
[normal]find a correlation between the number of women
[normal] teachers at school and the gender equality in terms of computer use. 
[normal]13
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The presence of female 
[normal]academic staff 
[normal]in universities 
[normal]is one important source of mentoring. Fresh new students look up to their lecturers and professors for inspiration and future guida
[normal]nce. What better example of successful women in 
[normal]computer science 
[normal]can be served t
[normal]o female students than their 
[normal]tutors? 
[normal]Evidence suggests that 
[normal]this is particularly important as a positive higher education environment 
[normal]serves to inspire 
[normal]women
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]positive fee
[normal]dback is more important to them
[normal] than their male counterparts
[normal].
[normal]14
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]S
[normal]ome other evidence suggests
[normal] that university 
[normal]departments with 
[normal]less 
[normal]female 
[normal]academics 
[normal]lost female student
[normal]s at high rates relative to men
[normal]. 
[normal]Recent figures show that 
[normal]in the UK 
[normal]only one in 20 computin
[normal]g professors, one in eight computing researchers and one in four PhD students are female
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Reversing Trends[bold]15
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]C
[normal]omputer science
[normal] as a discipline is unique, both in its history, as young but fast developing and, in its nature as problem-solving, algorithmic and technology-oriented. In recent years, its boundaries have expanded to overlap and adjoin a number of other disciplines, inc
[normal]luding business and management (information systems), philosophy and psychology (human computer interaction and artificial intelligence), physiology (genetic algorithms and neural networks), digital art and graphics (multimedia and entertainment) and lingu
[normal]istics, which have been traditionally outside the realm of science. It is important to observe this 
[normal]so that it offers a unique proposition for sustaining and welcoming many more women in IT-related careers, as 
[normal]opposed to traditional sciences and many other
[normal] STEM subjects
[normal].
[normal]16
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The IT 
[normal]industry more re
[normal]cently has launched some encouraging initiatives 
[normal]which offer hope and 
[normal]a bright future for a lot of women entering IT-related careers. The notable of these initiatives include The Google Anita Borg Memorial Scholarship
[normal], Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, 
[normal]Athena SWAN (an initiative of the Equality Change Unit (ECU) and UK Research Councils (UKRC)) 
[normal]and BCSWomen (a specialist group of the British Computer Society dedicated to women members). 
[normal]Recommendations[bold]17
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Computer Science, along with 
[normal]the 
[normal]wider 
[normal]range of 
[normal]STEM subjects,
[normal] 
[normal]need
[normal]s
[normal] an image makeover. 
[normal]A 
[normal]coordinated 
[normal]national effort is needed to 
[normal]address 
[normal]this and raise the profile of STEM as 
[normal]progressive and welcoming careers 
[normal]for women.
[normal] 
[normal]This has to be 
[normal]realised thro
[normal]ugh a
[normal] mix of 
[normal]top-down 
[normal]and bottom-up policy 
[normal]initiatives
[normal], and should be a medium- to long-term goal. 
[normal]No quick fixes would serve to be effective. 
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]18
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The early years, through school and university education, are critical 
[normal]if we
[normal] are to allow women to raise confidenc
[normal]e and self-esteem.
[normal] 
[normal]A variety of areas need particular attention including 
[normal]appropriate 
[normal]training
[normal] of school staff in STEM subjects, 
[normal]female
[normal] mentoring
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]after-school 
[normal]resources
[normal],
[normal] to overcome cultural and confidence issues for female students. 
[normal]19
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Large industry players, such as Google, IBM, Intel and 
[normal]Microsoft
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]are beginning to play a positive role for women scientists in the IT sector. 
[normal]The go
[normal]vernment and the third-sector 
[normal]need to work with 
[normal]them to 
[normal]address this jointly, through more scholarships and
[normal] internships,
[normal] better recognition of achievement of women in STEM sectors, 
[normal]dedicated professional networking opportunities, 
[normal]and more family-friendly 
[normal]working policies 
[normal]to allow for a 
[normal]better 
[normal]work-life balance.
