"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Greater Manchester Combined Authority and Transport for Greater Manchester (LTD0024)Greater Manch\nester Combined Authority (GMCA)\n has welcomed the Government’s policy to devolve resources, decision-making and functions away from Whitehall and toward the city region.\n This submission\n to the Committee\n highlights in particular:\n1.              What is the rationale for the Government’s proposals to devolve to a local level decision-making on transport expenditure? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Government’s approach? Are there better models? \n1.1\n              \nGreater Manchester established the\n first Combined Authority in t\nhe country\n \nin April 2011, reflecting the importa\nnce given to governance at the heart of our city region growth strategy, alongside the GMLEP, building on the long-standing\n tradition of effective joint working \nacross local public and private sector partners in the city region. \n1.2\n              \nWe share Government’s \nview that an over-centralised state can act as a barrier to the most effective\n local\n public sector reform and economic growth\n; and w\ne \nhave developed\n a compelling case for how devolution\n can\n yield significant benefits\n at both the local and national level\n.\n \nDe\nvolution\n to the right level of local government enables effective coordination and prioritisation of spending to be maintained in support of local growth and regeneration objectives. \nMoreo\nver, a\nt a time when public resources are scarce,\n we believe\n that\n i\nt is more important than ever that we allow places with mature governance arrangements and clear strategies to determine their own transport priorities to drive GVA and growth.\n1.\n3\n              \nCity region governance in Greater Manchester mirrors the conurbation’s func\ntional economic area\n \nthat generates an annual GVA of £48 billion\n and is \nhome to\n a growing population of over 2.7 million people. \nDevolution has enabled decisions and funding considerations in relation to transport to be\n \nmade in a much broader context,\n including strategic planning, future housing and employment site development, \ntown centre regeneration -\n and provides for a fuller understanding of environmental impacts. \n1.4\n              \nThis has enabled\n GMCA and the GM Local Enterprise Partnership \nto secure\n a long \nterm consensus \non policy direction and spending priorities, as set out in \nthe\n recently revised\n G\nreater \nM\nanchester\n Strategy, \nStronger Together\n, with a clear focus on growth and value for money. \nCritically\n, through the GVA-led investment criteria that we hav\ne developed and adopted locally, we are able to ensure that our investment priorities are consistently focussed on growth in a way that Government department appraisal \napproaches cannot, with\n this\n being\n particularly so in the case of \nDfT\n’s\n transport apprai\nsal methodologies\n.  \n2.              Do local bodies (including local authorities, local enterprise partnerships, passenger transport executives, integrated transport authorities and local transport boards) have the capacity to assess, prioritise and deliver local transport schemes? What would the optimum delivery body look like?2.1\n              \nOur\n city region governance system is supported by t\nhe transport expertise developed by Transport for Greater Manchester (\nTfGM\n, the renamed GM Passeng\ner Transport Executive) providing\n \npo\nlicy support, technical appraisal and the delivery capability required for transport schem\nes of all sizes and complexity. \nThis evolving, adaptable \nand\n a\nccountable governance structure has \nensured that Greater Manchester is well placed to\n work with Governme\nnt’s\n new approach to funding major transport schemes\n to maximise local and national policy objectives\n.\n We look forward to developing further aspects of devolution through the new Growth Deal that we intend to agree with Government in 2014 with a view to pr\nogressing reform and \nefficiency across all agencies involved in delivering transport investment and services in Greater Manchester\n.\n  \n \n2.2\n              \nT\nhe o\nptimum delivery body\n depend\ns\n on local circumstances\n and requirements\n; \nit is to some extent \na corollary of the devolutionary process that different arrangements will emerge as appropriate responses for \ndifferent\n geographies and circumstances. \nTherefore, we welcome the Government\n’s\n continued\n policy\n intention, as established under the recent City D\neal policy, to establish local arrangements for devolution that reflect local governance arrangements and local priorities in different parts of the country\n, so that those who are ready to progress with devolution quickly are able to do so\n.\n \nThis is importa\nnt in the case of Greater Manchester, where we have strong governance and delivery capacity already in place, thanks to the £2 billion transport investment programme underway here, and are therefore ready to accelerate the rate of devolution to a greater d\negree than will be the case elsewhere. \n \n3.              What is the best way of dealing with major transport schemes that cross local authority boundaries or have wider regional impact? \n&#xa0;\n3\n.1\n              \n              \nGreater Manchester maintains a dialogue with neighbouring authorities, \nwith a view to \naddressing\n connectivity\n barriers that if\n resolved collaboratively can yield benefits for the wider economic area.\n \nThis contemporary form of engagement offers\n significant\n benefits over the previous regional\n model, which attempted to determine\n \ncollaboration\n between local authorities on the basis of artificial boundaries such as the North West. In the absence of these structural constraints, Greater Manchester has established new cross-boundary working, with South and West Yorkshire for example,\n that better reflect economic interdependencies and opportunities to secure improvements through economies of scale.\n&#xa0;\n3\n.3\n              \nWe see further scope for collaboration in the future, particularly if the providers of key motorway and rail infrastructure linking \nGreater Manchester with neighbouring areas are also drawn into close working arrangements with us. However, under current arrangements that limit the funding available to local transport, neighbouring authorities are often constrained in their ability to c\nollaborate in direct spending partnerships. Long-term funding deals with authorities would provide greater scope for cross-\nboundary spending partnerships.\n4.              How effectively do local bodies work with each other and with Government departments and national transport agencies?              \n4\n.1\n              \nIn recent years, northern transport authorities have demonstrated their ability to collectively prioritise and promote \ngenuinely transformative transport schemes that deliver cross-boundary impacts\n. \nThe \nNorthern Hub\n rail investmen\nt programme was established as a national investment priority following a concerted effort\n by all northern partners\n \nand Network Rail \nto promote a clear and consistent business case for the expansion of rail capacity to secure regional benefits\n. \nCloser \nworking between \nTfGM\n, Greater Manchester highway authorities\n and the Highways Agency has also begun to bring benefits \nthrough a series of protocols that establish common principles for working across adjacent parts of the strategic and local highway system\n.\n \nFurther effective\n project-based\n joint working \nhas also taken place \nin relation to a number of schemes, such as the construction of the \nOrdsall\n Chord (a key element of the Northern Hub), a complex scheme which involves local highways\n and planning authorit\nies, Highways Agency, Network Rail and\n \nTfGM\n.\n&#xa0;\n4\n.2\n              \nThis local approach to regular and effective\n working \nis\n increasingly\n mirrored at a\n planning and governance\n level, with regular dialogue \nnow in place\n between \nTfGM\n, the Highways Agency, Network Rail\n and \nDfT\n \nt\nhrough a series of officer \nengagement channels\n.  In addition, representatives of Network Rail and other agencies attend meetings of the Transport for Greater Manchester Committee, both to brief members on specific infrastructure developments and to respond\n to service issues.\n&#xa0;\n4\n.3\n              \nWe see scope to take these relationships further to ensure consistent alignment\n between local economic priorities and \ninvestment decisions made by national bodies,\n such as Network Rail and the Highways Agency.\n \nWe are keen, for \nexample, to explore the opportunities offered by the forthcoming revised Highways Agency arrangements to align investment activities across the local and strategic highways system in Greater Manchester.\n&#xa0;\n4.4\n              \nIn the context of rail\n devolution\n and preparatio\nn for HS2\n,\n we \nare proposing \na \nre\nfresh\ned\n relationship \nwith\n Network Rail\n to ensure that national investment supports local growth priorities and to promote partnership spending arrangements\n.\n Critically,\n \nHS2 offers a unique opportunity to secure long-term gro\nwth and regeneration in Greater Manchester, subject to the right levels of facility being secured at Manchester Piccadilly in particular. This will require long-term partnership funding arrangements with Network Rail that enable optimal scheduling of inves\ntment across Control Periods 5, 6 and 7 to ensure that transformational facilities can be delivered to unlock regeneration benefits at the earliest opportunity.\n5.              Do the current funding streams for major local transport schemes meet the needs of local authorities? How do current funding streams compare with previous arrangements?&#xa0;\n5\n.1\n              \nEffective devolution requires\n a predictable and stable funding regime over the long term\n. \nT\nhe \nlevel of funding available for major local transport schemes\n \nhas \nhistorically\n \nbeen\n significantly\n below \nthat required to meet economic growth potential. \nT\nhere remains a substantial funding gap between the large city regions outside London and the capital itself, with Treasury figures showing that the total public spend per head on t\nransport in London is 2.3 times greater than the spend per head for the North of England and the West Midlands combined (source: \npteg\n).\n In addition\n, the process for determining major scheme funding decisions has been constrained by a scheme-by-scheme analy\nsis by central government. Collectively, this has undermined the ability of authorities to promote the programmes of infrastructure investment that give wealth creators the confidence to undertake entrepreneurial investment in a local economy, as has been \nseen in London from the Docklands Light Railway onwards. \n&#xa0;\n5\n.2\n              \nL\nocally, the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities\n \nsought to address this through \nthe £1.5 billion GM Transport Fund (GMTF)\n in 2009. This\n initiative built on the “self-help” approach to transport infrastructure provision that Greater \nManchester adopted two years’ earlier to unlock a funding package for the £575 million \nMetrolink\n Phase 3(a) programme, more than half of which \nwas\n provided by \nlocal funding. GMTF \nsupports the delivery \nof economically focused transport investment \nthrough long-term commitments made both locally and for \ncentral government major scheme funding\n \nas\n set out below\n. \n&#xa0;\nFunding SourceCapital Buying Power (£ m)Share of totalDfT\n Major Scheme Funding\n448\n29%\nRing Fenced \nDfT\n contribution to the SEMMMS scheme\n165\n11%\nLTP\n Integrated Transport Block (ITB)\n Top Slice\n147\n10%\nPrudential Borrowing supported by contributions from the Levy, \nMetrolink\n revenues and third parties\n775\n50%\nTotal1,535100%&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5\n.3\n              \nH\nence, major scheme transport funding in Greater Manchester is now a complex product of direct (major schemes) and indirect (top-sliced ITB) central government funding alongside local prudential borrowing. \nT\nhrough the\n 2012\n City Deal\n, GMCA has agreed the principle of an\n \n“\nEarn Back\n”\n model\n with Government, which\n builds on the self-sufficiency \napproach to\n delivering infrastructure investment. The model uses a formula to provide a\n long-term\n revenue stream to\n support further long\n-term investment, subject to\n additional GVA, \nmeasured i\nn changes in rateable values\n at the Greater Manchester level,\n being\n created relative to a 2015 baseline. Earn Back, therefore, provides\n both a future revenue stream and\n an additional incentive for Grea\nter Manchester to prioritise local government spending to maximise GVA growth.\n \nMore recently, a number of other city regions have indicated their intention to develop self-reliance models as part of moves towards revised governance, demonstrating the impor\ntance of this approach. \n&#xa0;\n5.4\n              \nHowever, these new approaches will require consistent long-term commitment from all transport funding partners if their impact is to be sustained over the long-term. For example, through the forthcoming Local Growth Fund arran\ngement, Greater Manchester has been allocated a core provision of £110 million from 2015/16 to 2020/21, extending to £199 million by 2024/25. Whilst it is welcome to see Government establishing longer-term core allocations of major sche\nme funding, the scal\ne of funding should be viewed alongside spending priorities for the city region. \n \nFor the period to the end of the current decade alone, the Greater Manchester LTB has identified a minimum investment pip\neline of more than £300 million\n schemes,\n \nalongside the £350 million \nMetrolink\n extension to Trafford Park \nto support\n growth in the country’s largest industrial park, which is also home to the Trafford Centre and adjacent to the nationally important M60/M62 motorway. Beyond this, \nGMCA has\n set out t\nhe case for a major programme of tram-train developments, combining the country’s largest tram system with one of the fastest growing urban rail markets to enable growth to be sustained into the 2020s\n, alongside the delivery of transformational HS2 facilit\nies discussed at 4.4 above\n. \n&#xa0;\n5\n.6\n              \nT\nhe Committee is\n also\n encouraged to not overlook the importance of\n ITB\n funding, which enables\n local \ntransport authorities to directly deliver smaller investment schemes, such as\n local access\n and highways pinch-point\n measures\n, \nand acts as a long-term\n funding source to\n secure optimal larger solutions that could not be supported through development contributions alone\n. \nSince the CSR in 2010, ITB funding has reduced by \naround 50% compared to levels\n under the LTP2 period \nto \n2010/11\n. \nWe welcome the fact that ITB has been maintained as a p\nolicy for 2015/16 onwards, \nbut note\n that the £458 million per annum to be made available for ITB nationally\n will still be around 30% lower than the national provision in 2010/11. \nIn additio\nn\n, we have concerns about the likely \nallocation arrangements for\n the\n £258 million\n of ITB following r\necent consultation o\nn future\n allocation\n \nformula\n options\n, \nwhich suggested \na \nshift in funding away from the m\netropolitan areas\n.\n&#xa0;\n5\n.7\n              \nThe reduction in ITB has been \nin part offset by \na wide range of\n \nDfT\n funding competitions. \nHowever, this approach to funding \nruns the risk of undermining Government’s devolution intentions\n. In addition, the short-term natu\nre of funding competitions\n present\ns\n challenges for local transport authorities in planning for the long-term and\n in encouraging\n long-term private\n sector commitments to local investment\n or regeneration initiatives. \nFurthermore, \nsignifica\nnt staff resources are required to put together competi\ntive bids\n. In Greater Manchester, officers have addressed this challenge by taking \na\n city region-wide approach to bids, coord\ninated by \nTfGM\n. However, this has proved\n increasingly challenging for local authorities elsewhere\n and risks doing so here too in th\ne context of further reductions in local authority funding\n. \n&#xa0;\n5\n.8\n              \nFinally,\n we would highlight \nthe \nwider\n implications of further reductions in the local authority revenue support grant, \nfollowing\n the\n recent Spending Round\n. \nConsistent a\nccess to revenue funds \nfor \non-going travel services and promotion measures\n, which\n \nare \nessential in sustaining modal shift amongst commuters,\n \nhas been a long-standing \nissue\n.\n R\neduced local authority revenues have already brought reductions in local supported\n bus services and other travel support measures in many areas of the country\n;\n and\n they\n are likely to place increasing downward pressure on budgets for transport services in the major city regions outside London. The element of revenue funding provided thro\nugh the Local Sustainable Transport Fund (LSTF) has been a welcome change in this regard, \nalbeit that LSTF is still time-limited in nature even after t\nhe recent commitment to its extension\n for 2015/16. The recent national LSTF conference highlighted the ch\nallenges that this will bring beyond 2015/16 for authorities in sustaining support for local carbon and active travel measures. \n6.              What impact will the devolution in 2015 of funding to Local Transport Bodies and the introduction of the Single Local Growth Fund have?6\n.1\n              \nAs already set out above, Greater Manchester is well-prepared for the further devolution and changes to transport spending governance that the LGF will bring.\n Our governance arrangements remain the subject of on-going review, and we \nwelcome\n the opportunity through a future Growth Deal to establish local arrangements across the entire Greater Manchester investment framework, which \nmay remove the need for an explicit LTB. \n We will\n also be \nbe\n looking to utilise this\n opportunity to secure furthe\nr parallel reforms that ensure that the impact of LGF funds can be best maximised through clear long-term partnership and programme based investment frameworks across all local transport agencies operating in the city region. \n7.              How can local authorities attract greater investment from the private sector for the delivery and maintenance of local transport infrastructure? What scope is there for the use of alternative funding streams?7\n.1\n              \nAs set out under question 5\n above, a core long-term central governmen\nt funding commitment to local transport funding is a key component in attracting private sector funding. As also set out earlier, the Greater Manchester authorities recognise that not all of this funding can be accessed through traditional major schemes fu\nnding channels, but rather requires all parts of the public sector to align spending programmes in the interests of consistency. This could potentially include greater use of European Structural Investment Funds\n if UK Government can be persuaded of the cas\ne to press for greater deployment of EU SI Funds to support transport schemes that unlock real low carbon economic opportunity.\n \n7\n.2\n              \nIt also requires innovative thinking on the relationship between transport spending and future ret\nurns to the Treasury as \nshown in principle by the\n Earn Back model and in the current example of the funding agreement established for the transport infrastructure needed to support the Battersea/Nine Elms development in London. Looking towards the delivery of HS2 facilities, such\n as the proposed stations in Manchester, we see a need to develop this innovative approach to finance further\n, alongside the need for a long-term rail funding regime discussed \nabove,\n so as to ensure that transport facilities are delivered at a scale and pa\nce that ensures the wider economic impact of transport investment – in the form of new local employment and regeneration – is fully realised in practice.\n8.              How clear are the lines of accountability for local decision making on transport expenditure?8\n.1\n              \nA\ns set out above, \nG\nreater Manchester has established clear lines of accountability and a robust governance framework \nfor transport expenditure decision making\n. However, there remains some uncertainty over the specific role that \nDfT\n will play in supporting \ndevolved delivery of transport investment from April 2015. We would welcome clarity on this at the earliest opportunity\n, so as\n to ensure that systems can be best develop\ned to support shared objectives.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
