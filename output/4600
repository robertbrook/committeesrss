defaultCommentator's Background
default&#xa0;
defaultFirstly, not being an Aviation professional, I need to set out my background, so that my comments can be put into context.
default&#xa0;
defaultI graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering in 1970, following a 4 year Student Apprenticeship with BP. I obtained Professional Engineering status at age 28, becoming an M I 
defaultMech
default E. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFrom 1970, until 1987, I worked for BP on the design of major oi
defaultl and gas projects, including the Magnus Oil Platform, 
defaultSullom
default 
defaultVoe
default Oil Terminal, 
defaultAbu
default Dhabi liquefied natural gas plant, the Miller oil platform, etc. These projects were all technically challenging and had budgets, in terms of 2013 £'s, of circa £500 millio
defaultn to £1+ billion. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the course of this work, I was part of one accident investigation team, and was also part of an internal Safety Review Team auditing the design 
defaultof  BP's
default Buchan oil facility. During the time I spent on the various Projects, I flew, as
default a passenger, on various Helicopters including the Boeing Chinook, the Super Puma, etc. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFrom 1987 until 2003 I worked for the Department 
defaultof  Energy
default, and then the Department of Trade and Industry, firstly as a Senior, then Principal, Professional Technolo
defaultgy Officer (PPTO) - providing advice and recommendations on the development of oil and gas fields. On the Exploration and Development side, I was the Department 
defaultof  Energy
default Co-ordinator for the scrutiny of  Occidental's proposals for the Piper Bravo platfor
defaultm, following the tragic loss of the Piper Alpha platform, where 167 men perished. Of course there were considerable `Safety' overtones doing this work, which eventually led to the transfer 
defaultof  Safety
default responsibility from the Safety Division of  D Energy to 
defaultthe HSE. Towards the end of my time in DTI, I was DTI observer on the HSE Offshore Safety review panel, which involved discussions with the Unions, the Petroleum Industry Trade body, and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, 
defaultetc
default&#xa0;
defaultI also have some background 
defaultin the design, build and operation of various radio controlled Model Aircraft, including Model helicopters, and hold two competence Certificates from the British Model Flying Association. Given this overall technical background, I have experience in Fluid 
defaultMechanics, Thermodynamics, Rotating Machinery, Stress Analysis, and the theory of Flight. I have no experience 
defaultof  piloting
default full size Helicopters, but, as a Pupil,  I have flown Cessna 152 type light aircraft and gliders for small number of hours.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addi
defaulttion, I witnessed, from our house in Staines, on April 9
defaultth
default, 1968, the difficulties 
defaultof  Flight
default 712, which passed over us with an engine on fire. I also saw the fireball go up at Heathrow; 5 people died in that incident. The cause was a fatigue failure of a 
defaultlow pressure compressor wheel in an engine. In a similar vein, a BP work colleague from the Magnus Project died in the 
defaultKegworth
default crash, again caused by an engine failure, and crew error. Whilst we lived in Farnborough in Hampshire, two helicopter pilots wer
defaulte killed preparing for a display. Again, when with D En, on one flight to `familiarise' a Minister, my office colleague spotted fuel leaking through the roof lining of the helicopter, as it was about to take off from the platform. Needless to say, the alar
defaultm was raised, and they all disembarked in pretty short 
defaultorder !
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultSo I perhaps see the assertions that Aviation is a very safe form of transport with some reservations. Statistically it is fairly safe; but people are, nevertheless, still being put at risk.
default&#xa0;
defaultAviation activity in the vicinity 
defaultof  Harpenden
default&#xa0;
defaultThe relevance of this is that it led to a number of communications I had with the CAA and 
defaultDfT
default, from which I have been left with considerable concerns.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is a low level 
defaultflightpath
default directly above our hou
defaultse, which was used by light aircraft when we first moved to Harpenden in 1987. Layered above that were the Luton Airport 
defaultflightpaths
default, and often above that, depending on wind direction, `heavy' traffic out of Heathrow 
defaulteg
default fully laden Boeing 747's etc. Gradua
defaultlly what was a fairly benign low level `Cessna 152' type 
defaultflightpath
default became a helicopter route, especially during the `boom' years of 2000-2007. Also guests started to arrive at the nearby Luton 
defaultHoo
default Hotel by Helicopter. I witnessed a number of  helicopter a
defaultctivities which I regarded as dangerous – 
defaulteg
default a `beat up' by a helicopter over nearby 
defaultKinsborne
default Green, and various `rubbernecking' circuits by Robinson R22 helicopter pilots, including one where a Cessna 152 flew in close proximity to a Robinson. The Cessna
default pilot probably could not see the Robinson, as his downward view would be obscured by the engine cowl of the Cessna. Likewise the Robinson pilot would have had to look upwards and backwards over his shoulder to even try to catch a glimpse of the Cessna.
default&#xa0;
defaultA
defaultpart from the collision risk, I was concerned that major mechanical failure 
defaultof  the
default helicopter rotor assembly, or the gearbox, would lead to a situations where `landing clear', as required by the CAA regulations, would be impossible. This failure to `land 
defaultclear' would mean that the Helicopter would crash on our housing development.
default&#xa0;
defaultInvariably, the CAA would comment that they could not track what had happened on the radar, and therefore could offer no comment, other than that a helicopter or plane was permi
defaulttted to fly as close as 500 feet over us, which I regarded as `bonkers'. Similarly, circa 2-3 years ago, there was a photo in the Telegraph newspaper, showing a Robinson helicopter perched on a platform on the bank of the Thames near Henley (I think). Agai
defaultn the comment was that the CAA had inspected the site and it was found to be within the Regulations, which I found deeply worrying. (
defaultas
default an aside, the French apparently ban civilian helicopters from operating within the `
defaultPeriphique
default' in Paris.)
default&#xa0;
defaultI also had 
defaultcorrespondence with the CAA regarding the difficulty reading the Registration markings on Helicopters.  Given that CAA could not provide details from radar plots, and the fact that Transponders are often not used on smaller Helicopters, and the difficultie
defaults of reading the markings, I felt there was no effective safety monitoring 
defaultof  any
default incidents occurring in the low level route above our heads.
default&#xa0;
defaultEven if a helicopter did not suffer main rotor or gearbox failure, I also had misgivings about Helicopters being
default able to safely enter the `glide' (technically autorotation) should there be fuel or (single) engine problems. From what I have read on the Internet, it would seem that it is one thing to do an autorotation practice when the pilot knows it is coming, and q
defaultuite another if alarms come up and there is confusion. In fact there are apparently only a very few seconds to achieve autorotation particularly with `low inertia' rotor heads as per the Robinson R22 helicopter. Even with larger helicopters, apparently onc
defaulte those precious seconds have been lost, it is very difficult, in fact virtually impossible, to recover the machine into a safe autorotation, and a crash results.
default&#xa0;
defaultThree fellow Residents (including one who has a fixed wing Private 
defaultPilots
default Licence) have also
default had serious misgivings about the Police Helicopter in our area, as there is something called the V-H diagram, where V is velocity, and 
defaultH is
default height, in the flight manual of all Helicopters. This diagram is also called the `Dead Man's Curve', because there 
defaultare some combinations 
defaultof  speed
default and height from which it is impossible to enter auto-rotation, and therefore a crash is inevitable. We subsequently met the Police Chief Superintendent, and the Police Flight Operations Manager, and 
defaultexpressed our concerns ab
defaultout very low level flight. So, sadly, the recent Glasgow Police helicopter accident was one that I consider was waiting to happen, given the accident statistics for helicopters. My criteria for deploying a Police Helicopter would involve the question `is l
defaultife at 
defaultrisk' ?
default&#xa0;
default(Colin 
defaultMacRae
default, the rally driver, was killed in a helicopter accident, and Noel Edmonds, the TV personality, gave up helicopter flying after a friend was killed in another accident. From a recent US helicopter symposium it was reported in th
defaulte Press that helicopters had accidents 7.5 times in 100,000 operational hours 
defaultvs
default 0.175 accidents on the same basis for fixed wing aircraft. By my calculator 
defaultthat  makesdefault the accident risk about 42 times greater for the helicopter.default)
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultNorth Sea activity
default&#xa0;
defaultGen
defaulterally, North Sea Oil Platform operations personnel have significant technical training, and are highly aware of safety. As such they are more observant, and probably more critical, than the General Public. They are also aware that changing North Sea weath
defaulter conditions can cause problems, and that on landing on the Platform, the helicopter has to avoid the hot exhaust plumes from Power Generation, and avoid the flare stack. 
defaultdrilling
default derrick, large cranes, etc. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAlso, many of the maintenance (and sometimes 
defaultSafety) issues on North Sea Platforms are caused by rotating machinery such as gas turbines, gas compressors, main oil line pumps etc. Often these items are large precision items of many thousands 
defaultof  horsepower
default. So, knowing the lengths that Platform perso
defaultnnel have to go to keep this machinery running efficiently, it is no surprise that many oil workers are more than happy to disembark their flimsy helicopter, which is also full of rotating equipment such as shafts, gas turbines, gearboxes, 
defaultetc
default, all of whic
defaulth are built down to a stringent weight limit. Their flight may be in darkness, and in high winds and low visibility. Also the Helicopter is inherently more prone to damaging vibration, from rotor blade vortex `chopping', which can cause `fatigue' of compon
defaultents, necessitating replacement of critical components after a certain number of operational hours.
default&#xa0;
defaultNorth Sea Helicopter regulation
default&#xa0;
defaultGenerally, and following on from my North Sea experience, I believe it is a mistake for a `sponsoring' Department, such as
default 
defaultDfT
default, to oversee and possibly influence the CAA. There is always the concern when the Chancellor/Treasury wishes to expand a sector for economic 
defaultbenefit, that
default this message is subliminally passed down to a Department such as the 
defaultDfT
default/CAA. (Possibly we shall 
defaultsee a political U-turn on expanding Heathrow, on the back of GDP growth, business expansion, and never mind Climate Change, Particulates, 
defaultNOx
default, noise, 
defaultetc
default ?
default).
default&#xa0;
defaultFinally, we have the 
defaultwell known
default issue of the Civil Servant who does not want to make waves and up
defaultset his Director General, Minister etc. This may be because of cost pressures from the Aviation sector, `Euro' involvement, and the perceived need for `light touch' regulation, as often expressed by Ministers.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Oil Industry goes through various cycles 
defaultof `boom and bust' and cost pressures are always there, particularly in lean times. These pressures can then be passed down the supply chain to vendors such as Helicopter Operators. Thus there can often be debate with the unions such as the Transport &amp; Gen
defaulteral, for the 
defaultOffshore
default workers, and on the other hand BALPA, representing the Pilots, and the Helicopter Operating Company. I certainly would not want to be on a Helicopter piloted by an over stressed, tired Pilot.
default&#xa0;
defaultAlso, my concern is that although the CA
defaultA may have personnel with considerable aviation experience, maybe with the Military, that possibly these people have become conditioned to flying regimes with a much higher risk factor than for Civilian operations. I once had a Helicopter ride in Abu Dhabi
default with an ex Vietnam pilot, and that flight was `interesting'.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe other potential issue is that the CAA may tend to attract and 
defaultrecruit  `
defaultAviation Enthusiasts' who will possibly lean in the direction of the Aviation Industry.
default&#xa0;
defaultConclusion
default&#xa0;
defaultI have no doubt that there are many hard working professional people in the Helicopter Operations sector, doing their very best. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, I do view helicopter operations as intrinsically much more dangerous than that of that fixed wing operations. As the
default saying 
defaultgoes  -
default`Helicopters don't fly, they just beat the air to death ...'
default&#xa0;
defaultDespite CAA's probable protestations, it should be investigated if  the `Safety' aspects of Helicopter Operations would be served better by them being under the wing of the HSE, o
defaultr similar arm's length regime away from a sponsoring Department such as 
defaultDfT.
default&#xa0;
defaultFinally, I consider Helicopter operations should always 
defaultchallenged
default with the question `is this flight really 
defaultnecessary' ?
default Certainly for overland transportation, where there are th
defaulte Railways and Fixed wing options, maybe the answer should often be a `
defaultNo' ?
