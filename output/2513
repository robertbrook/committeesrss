default, legal organisations
default and individual

default 
defaultunited

defaultovernment's proposed attack on legal aid

default&#xa0;
defaultThe proposals are vague as to how the res
defaultidence test will be satisfied. Our members 
defaultsupport marginalised groups like domestic violence victims and child migrants and have drawn attention to the difficulties that clients will face when they need to provide evidence about residence and legal status. The residence test
default will present a bar to 
defaultthose who will be eligible for legal aid but unable to prove it.
default&#xa0;
defaultWorse still, the proposals will ine
defaultvitably result in those in despe
defaultrate need of legal help be
defaulting prevented from getting it. 
defaultThis will not only have dire consequences for the people involved but will promote a culture of impunity where abuse and unlawful action against those who cannot afford to pay for legal aid will go unchecked.  This is unacceptable in our view and will weak
defaulten the 
defaultrule of law by creating a two-t

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultWe are an alliance

defaultof charities, community groups, grass roots and other campaigning groups, trade unions
default, legal organisations
default and individuals wh
defaulto are u
defaultnited in our opposition to the G
defaultovernment's proposed attack on legal aid and the criminal justice
default&#xa0;
defaultsystem
default.
default These legal aid proposals are part of the larger assault on essential parts of the welfare state.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThis submission provides evidence in relat
defaultion to the proposed introduction of a residence test for civil legal aid claimants so as to limit legal aid to those with a ‘s
defaulttrong connection with the UK’. 
defaultThe reason we have focused on the residence test is that this proposal is most likely to affect 
defaultthose who our members support and advocate for and deny 
defaultindiv
defaultiduals access to justice. 
defaultWe are also concerned about the other areas to be considered by the Committee, including the proposals to change payments in judicial reviews which will make it hard for
default individuals to find lawyers and the proposals to remove legal a
defaultid for most prison law issues. 
defaultHowever, we are aware that others will be addressing the Committee on these important issues
default.
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are aware that the JCHR’s call for evidence was issued prior 
defaultto the consultation on j
defaultudicial review published on 
default6 September 2013.
default We have deep concerns about 
defaultprop
defaultosals that would
default restrict campaigning groups from brin
defaultg
defaulting judicial review
defaults or having costs protection. 
defaultIt is in our view vital that the residence test i
defaults seen in the context of these proposed wider restrictions on civil society that will prevent groups from accessing justice on behalf of those who are unable to help themselves.
default&#xa0;defaultWe have grave concerns about how this policy will work
default in practice.
default  The p
defaultr
defaulto
defaultposals are unclear about what will be required to prove that a person has the appropri
defaultate amount of lawful residence. 
defaultWe are concerned that efforts to prove this will distract from th
defaulte important task of getting 
defaultlegal help that is needed and 
defaultwill 
defaultdeter vulnerable people from getting legal assistance.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Government’s proposals would require legal aid providers to see and retain 
defaulteviden
defaultce on their files about lawful residence. T
defaulthis 
defaultwill 
defaultplace a
default substantial bureaucr
defaultatic burden 
defaulton 
defaultadvisers and could deter them from undertaking work for migrants as the risk of incorrect assessment would lead to a claim for their work being refused. The assessment is
default 
defaultalso 
defaultlikely to be
default far more complex 
defaultthan 
defaultthe Government suggests, espec
defaultially for providers who do not specialise in immigration, an area which is now largely out of scope for legal aid
default. 
defaultOne of our members, Just Rights, observes it can take a specialist j
defaultudge days to determine questions on lawful re
defaultsidency
default 
defaultand a
default lawyer committ
defaulted to protecting the rights of children and young people will simply not
default have the resources to do
default this.
default 
defaultThe Association of Prison Lawyers argues it is too 
defaultsimplistic to suggest that the provider will be able to make a straightforward judgement based upon 
defaulta passport
default as the Government has previously asserted. Neither does a stamp in a passport give an easy answer. 
defaultFurther, prisoners simply do not have easy access 
defaultto such documents, if they 
defaulthave them
default at all
default.
default T
defaulthe Home Office 
defaultwill also 
defaulthold passports when an ap
defaultplication is under consideration
default and communicating with them to get documents back or clarify issues of status
default is very difficult. 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Coram Children’s Legal Centre agrees that the Government has vastly simplified the issue of understanding both what is
default lawful residence and how it can be proven.
default They give the example of European Economic Area (EEA) 
defaultnationals, whose lawful residence
default 
defaultcomes from the exercise of rights under the Treaties that set up the European Union. The rights of EEA nationals exist with
defaultout the need for documents like a visa. For example, a French national working here is lawfully resident by the fact of their employment. Also, migrants who have made an application to extend their leave or appeal against the refusal of leave have lawful p
defaultermission to be in the UK under a provision of the law that automatically extends status while an application is pending
default.
default 
defaultIn the experience of our members, such subtleties of immigration law are commonly misunderstood by public bodies such as the Departme
defaultnt of Work and Pensions and private individuals like employers. The existence of a mechanism for NHS staff to check the immigration status of patients in secondary healthcare with the Home Office recognises both the complexity of this area and that sometim
defaultes documentary evidence of status will not exist.
default It is unreasonable to expect a legal aid lawyer to make determinations about lawful residence when most have no expertise in immigration law and the same burden is not placed on other public servants.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn 
defaultaddition to proving lawful residence at the point of an application for legal aid, t
defaulthe
default Government will require migrants to show a 12-month continuous period of residence at any point in the past. This could raise difficulties for an applicant and legal aid
default provider if the period had taken place long ago, as illustrated by the 
defaultCoram Children’s Legal Centre
default:
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultM is a national of France. When she was at university she lived in the UK for a year on an exchange programme. She is now 27 and has been living in the
default UK for the past six months with her young child and has been working. She and her child are about to be evicted and would qualify for legal aid for her housing matter, but her housing solicitor is unsure whether she meets the residence test. M cannot reme
defaultmber exactly how long she was in the UK when at university and cannot locate the exact dates to prove it was for 12 months. Additionally, during this time she went back to France during the holidays to see her parents and does not know whether this means s
defaulthe was not ‘continuously’ in the UK. Her housing solicitor asks her for evidence of her being in the UK lawfully, and does not know what to do when M says she has no visa or document to prove her lawful residence.
default”
default 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultIt is clear
default that the residence test will result in excluding some of the most vulnerable in our communities from justice.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is clear that the residence test is designed to shut out foreign nationals from challenging government complicity in torture, i
defaultnhumane and degrading treatment. This would include those subjected to extraordinary rendition and detention at 
defaultGuantanamo Bay 
defaultsuch as
default 
defaultBinyam Mohamed and 
defaultBisher Al-
defaultRawi
default, whose lawyers acted to secure their release while they were still outside the UK
default.
default If 
defaultthe residence test is 
defaultimposed, 
defaultnot one of Reprieve’s clients who have been victims of human rights violations associated with the ‘war on terror’ would be eligible for legal aid
default.
default Repri
defaulte
defaultve cite
defaults
default how 
defaultYunus
default 
defaultRahmatullah
default, a Pakistani citizen wrongfully arreste
defaultd by British forces in Iraq in February 2004 and handed over to US forces for rendition to 
defaultBagram
default, may not have been able to bring a judicial review claim in the UK enabling him to be formally identified. As has been widely reported, Mr 
defaultRahmatullah’s
default writ 
defaultof habeas relief was recently u
defaultpheld by the UK Supreme Court, 
defaultreaffirming the importance of the UK’s obligations t
defaultowards those it takes into its 
defaultcustody
default.
default 
defaultThe Justice Alliance believes that this is tantamount to immunity for unlawful Government action agai
defaultnst those without independent means.
default Challenging unlawful 
defaultbehaviour is 
defaultin the public interest, to reinforce the values we hold as a society, and for how Britain is seen by the rest of the world. And as stated by
default 
defaultthe Government’s 
defaultTreasury Counsel:
default&#xa0;
default“..
defaultto pr
defaultevent people bringing legal proceedings who are subject to the actions of the UK acting abroad, often in ways which are alleged to be contrary to the most fundamental human rights, is in our view impossible to reconcile with the rule of law.
default”
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultThe people and communities most likely to be hit by the residence test are also the most likely to be at risk of unlawful abuse.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe recent case of s
defaulte
defaultxual exploitation at Yarl
default’s W
defaultood 
defaultimmmigration removal
default 
defaultc
defaultentre
default illustrates how individuals most likely to fall foul of the residence test can be prime candid
defaultates for institutional abuse. Wi
defaultt
defaulth
defaultout the ava
defaulti
defaultlability of legal aid 
defaultto 
defaultdemand a full investigation, we are concerned that such practices will continue with 
defaultimpunity.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Justice Alliance also highlights the over representation of people from non British backgrounds in other cases of state abuse. The family of 
defaultJean 
defaultCharles de Menezes, an innocent member of the public shot dead by police,
default would have been preve
defaultnted from commencing civil pr
defaultoceedings to expose the police’s attempted cover up surrounding Jean Charles’ killing because they would not meet the residence t
defaultest.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Government has stated that victims of trafficking will now be 
defaultexempt from the residence test for certain cases. However, they will be subject to the test for any case that is not about an application for leave to enter or remain, employment or a claim for damages in connection with their trafficking. 
defaultThe consequence 
defaultof this is that an alleged victim of trafficking may be denied legal assistance at the time it is most needed.
default They will still have to pass the residence test to get help with cases falling under any other area of law like housing or community care. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultresidence test would also prevent an applicant getting legal aid to challenge the Government’s decision that there are no reasonable grounds to conclude they are a potential victim of trafficking. This is what happened in a recent landmark case in the High
default Court,
default where a claimant was removed to Nigeria after the Home Office determined she was not a victim of trafficking. This court found the decision to be unlawful and the Government has been ordered to return her to the UK. This claimant would have failed
default the residence test as she was brought here on a visitor’s visa for six months by her trafficker and was not lawfully resident at the point where she applied for legal aid and did not have 12 months of lawful residence.
default&#xa0;
defaultThat judgment
default found that the Home O
defaultffice policy on "historical victims" of trafficking is 
defaultitself 
defaultunlawful
default and this will have wide ranging implications for many other people. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultVictims of domestic violence are also likely to suffer because of the re
defaultsidence test. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Government has now introduced an exemption to the residence test for certain victims of domestic violence who need legal advice on an immigration application, but this would not extend protection to everyone who needed help. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultSouth
defaultall Black Sisters have told us about ‘Raheena’ who
default 
defaultarrived in the UK in May 2012. 
default&#xa0;
default“Although her husband was a British National, Raheena was granted ‘leave outside the immigration rules’ as she was unable to satisfy the criteria for a spouse visa. Raheena
default was subjected to violence and 
defaultabuse from her husband on a daily basis, and kept a prisoner in her own home. As part of the abuse, her husband often threatened to send her back to Ethiopia and to forcibly remove her daughter from her care. Raheena fled the
default matrimonial home in December 2012. She was refused assistance by Social Services as they claimed that they only owed her daughter a duty of care as she alone was a British National. Raheena approached Southall Black Sisters and we assisted her in submitti
defaultng an application for the Destitution Domestic Violence Concession (‘DDV Concession’) as she had been treated for all intents and purposes by the immigration authorities as a spousal visa applicant. This was refused. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWith our assistance, Raheena 
defaultinstructed immigration solicitors in March 2013 who challenged the UK
default 
defaultB
defaultorder 
defaultA
defaultgency
default’s 
default(UKBA) 
defaultdecision by way of judicial review. At a hearing at the High Court, the judge agreed with our view and overturned the UKBA’s decision not to accept Raheena’s appli
defaultcation for the DDV Concession. The High Court also ordered the local authority to assist Raheena and her daughter with accommodation and support under the relevant provisions of Children Act 1989. 
default&#xa0;
defaultRaheena then instructed her immigration solicitor to submi
defaultt an application for settlement under the Domestic Violence Rule, 
defaultwhich 
defaultshe was granted legal aid for as a result of the successful judicial review.”
default&#xa0;
defaultUnder the residence test, Raheena would not have been eligible for legal aid to challenge the UKBA’s deci
defaultsion by way of judicial review
default 
defaultas she had not been resident in the UK for 12 months. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultMany of those with the most pressing housing and community care needs would also suffer under the residence test.  Again, the Southall Black Sisters 
defaulthave told us the story of 
defaultJenna who fled Uganda in 2009 fearing persecution on th
defaulte grounds of sexual orient
defaultation:
default&#xa0;
default“Jenna’s partner was killed by a mob following the discovery that they were homosexuals. Jenna entered the UK on a visitor’s visa which she overstayed. Jenna then claimed asylum on two occasions and on both occasions, she was refused. As of Februar
defaulty 2012, she once again became an overstayer. In August 2012, Jenna was raped in the UK as a result of which, she fell pregnant. When she was 
defaultseven
default months
default’
default pregnant, Jenna approached her local authority for help which was refused. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn April 2013, Jenna atte
defaultnded a routine hospital appointment where she disclosed her homelessness and destitution to the midwife who referred her to our services. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSouthall Black Sisters 
defaultassisted Jenna in instructing community care solicitors who intervened on her behalf and 
defaulteventually sent a pre-action protocol letter. On receipt of the letter, Jenna was immediately accommodated by her local authority.”
default&#xa0;
defaultUnder the residence test, 
default Jenna would be excluded from legal advice 
defaultfrom
default solicitors who were able to quickly and effective
defaultly help her obtain accommodation. Had she not obtained this advice, it is likely that she would still be homeless and her child could have been taken into care, depriving the child of its mother and creating an additional and unnecessary burden on public f
defaultinances. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe
default residence test would also exclude migrants with significant support needs despite a legitimate right to be in the UK. The
default Coram Children’s Legal Centre
default give the example of a child with leave to remain as a refugee dependent who would fail t
defaulthe residence test because he had not been in the UK for twelve months. This child would lose the chance to get help that could ensure his best interests and welfare are met, through no fault of his own:
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultL and her son came to the UK three months ago from 
defaultIran through refugee family reunion to join L’s husband. L’s son is eight and has autism and L is struggling to know how to find him suitable support and education. The local authority has not done an assessment and has not complied with its duties to L’s 
defaultson. L was advised to call the Civil Legal Advice telephone gateway and established that she is eligible for legal aid and that her son’s special educational needs fall within the scope of legal aid. However, she and her son have only been in the UK for th
defaultree months, so he will have to wait another nine months before he passes the residence test and can qualify for legal aid.
default”
default&#xa0;
defaultWe recommend that:
default&#xa0;
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultthe JCHR consider the proposals to restrict legal aid in the wider cont
defaultext of legal aid, including any measure to restrict representative 
defaultgroups from bringing applications for judicial review;
default&#xa0;
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultthe JC
defaultHR seeks evidence from the Minis
defaulttry of Justice as to how the proposed scheme will work and the impact that the proposed require
defaultments are like
defaultly to have on access to justice;
default&#xa0;
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe JCHR concludes that the residence test must not be brought into force.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWe would be happy to provide further evidence or oral evidence if this would assist the committee.
