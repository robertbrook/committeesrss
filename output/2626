[normal]Written evidence submitted by British Naturism [OLS0073][bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Introduction[bold]As stated by the Committee, the online world poses 
[normal]hazards
[normal],
[normal] ranging from images of child abuse to trolling
[normal],
[normal] that are the converse of the immense benefits of unimpeded communication and free speech provided by the 
[normal]internet
[normal], and so any attempt to mitigate harm has to be proportionate and avoid disadvantageou
[normal]s consequences.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]British Naturism (BN) is the national organisation that represents naturists in the UK. A full description of
[normal] Naturism is on BN’s website 
[normal][1] but, in short, 
[normal]Naturism is the enjoyment of life in every usual way, save that clothes are needed
[normal] only for physical protection.
[normal]Naturism contains, among other things, a clear 
[normal]belief[bold] about
[normal] the universality and acceptability
[normal] 
[normal]of our one
[normal] true possession—the human body—and its wholeness.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our concerns in the debate about Child Safety Online arise when cons
[normal]idering topics such as:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We deal first with the three issues highlighted by the Committee:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1. Protecting minors from adult content[bold]We agree that minors should be protected from some online content, but qualify this
[normal] stance as follows:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1 Evidence[bold]. Any classification of content as "adult" or "inappropriate" must be based on factual evidence, not on emotion, myth or prejudice. The preferences of an ill-informed, perhaps bigoted, minority cannot be allowed to overrule
[normal] the reasonable attitudes of the majority. For example, some people believe that seeing an image of a naked body is harmful to children, but there is simply no evidence that this is the case. On the contrary, there is much evidence that links prudish attit
[normal]udes to the body with high levels of eating disorders, body shame and 
[normal]body anxiety in young people
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2 Minors.[bold] The use of the term "age appropriate" should not be used in legislation without careful definition. Age verification is used, for example, by gambling websites where the possession of a valid credit card forms both the financial security and implicit veri
[normal]fication of the person’s right to gamble. But in the general case of free access to 
[normal]unsuitable websites,
[normal] 
[normal]it is unclear to us what mechanism could be devised that verifies the age of
[normal] the individual who has made initial access, but does not 
[normal]block the
[normal] unverif
[normal]iable 
[normal]access by
[normal], say
[normal], another family member or friend to whom control of the device is passed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3 Filters.[bold] Some filters are centrally defined black lists (e.g. Google SafeSearch), others depend on white lists (e.g. TwoTen). Our opinion is that white list
[normal]s are feasible for protecting the youngest children, black lists have drawbacks:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4 Regulation.[bold] Unlike an industry centred on physical media (films, DVDs, video games) where classification of titles can help the public protec
[normal]t 
[normal]itself
[normal] from unwanted material, the internet presents a different kind and scale of challenge. By design the internet is constantly growing and changing, so that regulation by any one country is limited to rather crude blocks on major websites
[normal] (usually th
[normal]ose 
[normal]that authorities consider politically 
[normal]destabilising)
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Satellite mediated mobile telecoms will tend to dissolve national boundaries 
[normal]and render such 
[normal]control
[normal]s less effective
[normal]. The suggestion that Ofcom could perform a role like that of the BBFC is clearly 
[normal]infeasible, and the suggestion that Ofcom can set attainable standards for filtering and for age verification is probably 
[normal]not practicable either.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. Filtering out extreme material (e.g. images of child abuse, and information promoting terrorism and violen[bold]ce)[bold]We understand "extreme material" principally to mean content that is already defined as illegal, and we expect that ownership of and access to such content should be prevented by legal means. Organisations such as the Internet Wat
[normal]ch Foundation already 
[normal]provide 
[normal]service
[normal]s that identify
[normal] such dangers, as do i
[normal]nvestigators in the Police and s
[normal]ome charities that have protection in their aims. To the extent that filtering can be made to work, such material should continue to be blocked internationally.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. Prevent[bold] abusive and threatening comments on social media[bold]We are concerned about the misuse of social media by irresponsible citizens (both adults and children), but think that individual occurrences of such abuse should be identified by those closest to perpetrat
[normal]ors and remedial action taken. Legislation already exists to deal with such obviously anti-social behaviour if it persists and causes harm, and both sanctions and education can follow.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Returning to the topics we listed in the Introduction: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. Naturists’[bold] use of online methods to maintain and promote nat[bold]urism[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].1 Blocking.[bold] ISPs 
[normal]and MPOs 
[normal]must not be forced or allowed secretly to make inaccessible any website which contains images of the naked human body that
[normal] 
[normal]are not remotely pornographic [2
[normal]]. So, for examp
[normal]le, the completely legitimate and informative websites that we and 
[normal]other
[normal] naturists use should never be threatened by over-zealous blocking, especially if there is either no channel for redress or only one entailing expensive litigation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2 Libel.[bold] Naturis
[normal]m is a popular, accepted and wholesome lifestyle all over Europe. British naturists should not be forced by legislation into an association with pornography. It would be unacceptable for naturist websites to be subject to filters that may be lifted only by
[normal] their legitimate users signing up for or opting into a service that, though dubbed “adult”, is considered pornographic by not only service providers but also by other authorities who increasingly try to monitor individuals’ electronic communications. Inde
[normal]ed, such a website and its users could in that circumstance consider that they had been libelled,
[normal] 
[normal]and initiate legal action.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3 Human rights[bold]. Freedom of expression protects the inter
[normal]ests and images of naturism
[normal]. There are no restrictions of Art.10 rights due to pressing social need in this 
[normal]context
[normal]. Indeed, there is a Human R
[normal]ights ruling 
[normal]which places
[normal] a positive duty on national governments to protect freedom of expression. The current discussions 
[normal]about
[normal] legislatio
[normal]n 
[normal]give
[normal] an opportunity to make 
[normal]much more accountable those large
[normal] corporations that have 
[normal]de facto
[normal] monopolies over some aspects of modern life. The 
[normal]current
[normal] campaigns to stop Facebook censoring breast feeding illustrate why this is necessary.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. Prejudice aga[bold]inst minority groups (such as naturists) can[bold] drown evidence which supports them[bold]5.1[bold] Largely covered in §1.1 above. 
[normal]5.2[bold] Blocking or filtering material that not only does no harm to children, but is actually useful or necessary to them, is harmful. Indeed, 
[normal]such blocking would encourage attitudes known to result in 
[normal]widespread
[normal] and often serious damage. A
[normal]ddition
[normal]al
[normal] to §1.1, p
[normal]rudish attitudes 
[normal]also 
[normal]exacerbate 
[normal]body knowledge related indicators such as teenage pregnancy
[normal] 
[normal][3
[normal]].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6. Concerns abou[bold]t body image issues in c[bold]hildren[bold]This subject has see
[normal]n much discussion in recent
[normal] years. The overwhelming conclusion is that better education within families and by teachers is needed to mitigate the harmful effects of commercial fashion industry advertising and the concomitant peer pressure experienced by children. BN believes that a 
[normal]proper understanding and acceptance of the human body from an early age provides the best background against which such education can be laid. To risk suppressing this kind of basic information from internet sources would not be helpful.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7. [bold]Safeguarding[bold] e[bold]ducation in Art, Science, Medical health and W[bold]ellbeing, Sex and Relationships[bold]It 
[normal]must be recognised that it 
[normal]is 
[normal]how
[normal] 
[normal]bodies are
[normal] shown that matters, not 
[normal]what
[normal] is shown
[normal]. Legislation must take due account of the social and cultural value of material that happens
[normal] to contains imagery of naked humans. None of the areas listed here is trivial; all may have to refer to the human body as it actually is. Despite the r
[normal]eservations 
[normal]of some minorities
[normal], the right to publish and consume such important material is of paramount
[normal] significanc
[normal]e to every new generation in our culture and country.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8. Conclusion[bold]In summary, we look to parenting and education to inform children of the risks inherent in internet use, to established authorities to block illegal content, and to society in
[normal] general to continue to broaden its tolerance of harmless and potentially valuable 
[normal]attitudes
[normal]. [4]

[normal]Notes[bold]&#xa0;[bold][1] 
[normal]http://www.bn.org.uk/articles.php/_/information/about-naturism/what-is-naturism-r18
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal][2] Pornography has no universally accepted definition. We tak
[normal]e the view that pornography is that sexual material which is in some proven way harmful to society by its influence on adults or children. Thus, accepted sex and health educational material is not pornographic, nor are images of the naked human in Naturist
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]Artistic, Scientific and Medical
[normal] contexts.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal][3] We observe, in UNICEF research on teenage birth rates in the rich nations, a clear correlation between high such birth rates and prudish attitudes across the countries studied. The correlation is
[normal] near perfe
[normal]ct, the causal mechanisms well underst
[normal]ood, and the effects large.

[normal]ng campaign by B
[normal]N to help keep N
[normal]aturism, its ideals and its value to society
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]legitimate and recognised. We would be more than happy to interact with the Select Committee on any of the above issues and opinions or on related ones.
