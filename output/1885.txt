[[[Channel 4 (CLC056)]]]&#xa0;Introduction Channel 4 has been asked to give evidence to the Science and Technology Select Committee inquiry on public understanding of climate, in particular in relation to the role of media in raising awareness of such issues. While it is important for the preservation of editorial independence that specific issues concerning editorial coverage are not subject to political interference, Channel 4 is happy to provide the Committee with information on the broader media landscape that it operates in – including our regulatory framework, our broad approach to science programming and how it delivers to our remit, and examples of specific programmes that relate to climate issues. The below note outlines these points in further detail below. &#xa0;Channel 4 Channel 4 is an independent publicly-owned, commercially-funded public service broadcaster, with a statutory remit to be innovative, experimental and distinctive. Unlike the other commercially-funded public service broadcasters, Channel 4 is not shareholder-owned: commercial revenues are the means by which Channel 4 fulfils its public service remit. In addition, Channel 4‟s not-for-profit status ensures that the maximum amount of its revenues are reinvested in the delivery of its public service remit. &#xa0;Channel 4‟s remit specifically states that it must provide “a broad range of high quality and diverse programming” including “programmes of an educational nature and other programmes of educative value.” This remit was updated by the Digital Economy Act 2010 which, among other requirements, states that Channel 4 must support and stimulate well-informed debate on a wide range of issues, as well as promoting alternative views and new perspectives. &#xa0;We recognise that the media, including broadcasters, has an important role to play in improving public understanding, and raising awareness, of key issues of national and international interest, including scientific and environmental issues. Channel 4 regularly commissions programmes that cover these topics, including over the past few years, a number of programmes looking at the impact of, and reasons behind, changes to our climate. &#xa0;As a commercially-funded public service broadcaster, Channel 4 must also ensure that its programming is as engaging and compelling to viewers as possible. Viewers appreciate genuinely bold and distinctive content that takes a unique and alternative look at scientific issues. In recent years, we have sought to maximise the impact and scale of this content through a number of ambitious formats – including live broadcasts, second-screen interactive experiences, and studio debates – thereby further helping to attract audiences that may not otherwise traditionally watch science-related programming. &#xa0;Channel 4‟s approach to scientific programmes Factual programmes in areas such as science, including climate change, are important aspects of the traditional bedrock of public service television. Channel 4 recognises that such content needs to be both interesting and accessible in order to reach large audiences. In recent years it has sought to achieve this by focusing on issues that directly affect viewers (such as weather extremes) while ensuring that individuals with a real understanding of the scientific issues under discussion are featured often. This approach has proved popular with our target audience, with 95% of the UK‟s most popular factual programmes amongst 16-29 year olds in 2012 being original Channel 4 commissions. &#xa0;In line with our remit, Channel 4 is also committed to demonstrating innovation and creativity in its wider approach to science programming and has, on a number of occasions in recent years, broadcast ambitious programmes that have sought to explore key scientific issues in imaginative and distinctive ways. These include: &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Examples of Channel 4 programmes relating to climate issues In recent years Channel 4 has provided a number of programmes aimed at improving public knowledge of the debate surrounding climate change. While some of these programmes have investigated the very issue of climate change itself, including a live studio discussion examining the best approach to tackling climate change in the long-term, much of our programming in this area has taken a broader look at the day-to-day effect of changes to our environment, such as changes to our weather systems, which we believe play an equally important educational role. In addition, Channel 4 News regularly provides coverage of climate change issues, both through its day-to-day analysis of policy developments and within its special reports. &#xa0;Below is a list of examples of programmes that Channel 4 has broadcast in recent years on this issue – either directly examining the case of climate change or looking at changes to our climate and the scientific reasoning behind it. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Channel 4 News Channel 4‟s flagship news programme – Channel 4 News – can also play an important role in informing our viewing audience about developments in the climate change sector, which, in turn, helps to promote greater understanding of the wider climate change debate. &#xa0;Channel 4 News has, in recent years, covered a number of climate issues, with our dedicated Science Editor, Tom Clarke, providing insight and analysis into these issues both on-screen and online. In addition, the Channel 4 News website provides a dedicated “climate change” webpage collating all our coverage on related topics. &#xa0;As a daily news programme, Channel 4 News keeps viewers up-to-date with the key policy developments relating to climate change as and when they are deemed to be editorially relevant. In recent months, for example, the programme has covered events such as the extension of the Kyoto Protocol to further nations , the announcement that Arctic ice levels have reached an all-time low, and the publication of the Energy Bill. A wide range of specialists on climate change are interviewed as part of these news articles in order to ensure that viewers are well informed about the broad range of views in this area.&#xa0;In addition, Channel 4 News has also sought to provide viewers with further analysis of key issues in this area through a series of special reports focused in part on the effects of climate change. These have included: &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Channel 4 believes that this in-depth news coverage, in addition to our wider programming outlined above, plays an important role in helping to improve public understanding of what is meant by climate change. The wide range of contributors included in this content also helps to ensure that viewers are provided with a plurality of views in this area, thereby further benefiting their understanding of climate change. &#xa0;Ofcom Broadcasting Code As with all of Channel 4‟s content, our coverage of scientific and climate-related topics is subject to the Ofcom Broadcasting Code, which requires programmes to meet a number of rigorous rules aimed at protecting viewers and contributors. &#xa0;In particular, the Code requires all broadcasters to ensure “due accuracy” in its news coverage and wider programming. In addition, broadcasters must ensure that there is “due impartiality” on matters relating to current public policy and, where it applies, on matters of political or industrial controversy. Channel 4’s experienced Legal and Compliance team provides expert advice to commissioners on the application of the Ofcom Broadcasting Code across all of our content to ensure that we comply fully with its rules regarding “due impartiality”. &#xa0;In addition, the Code also includes rules relating to “fairness”, which governs how broadcasters treat the individuals or organisations directly affected by programmes. Contributions must be represented fairly following editing of a programme, and steps must be taken by broadcasters to ensure that material facts have not been presented, disregarded or omitted in a way that is unfair to an individual or organisation. If a programme makes significant allegations regarding individuals or organisations, those concerned should normally be given an appropriate and timely opportunity to respond. &#xa0;This Code, in addition to Channel 4‟s own internal legal and compliance procedures, helps to ensure that our coverage of sensitive and polarising issues, such as climate related issues, is fair, accurate and balanced. &#xa0;Channel 4 hopes that this submission is of assistance to the Science and Technology Select Committee. &#xa0;July 2013&#xa0; http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-plane-crash http://www.channel4.com/programmes/drugs-live-the-ecstasy-trial http://www.channel4.com/programmes/how-to-build-a-bionic-man http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-worlds-weirdest-weather http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-year-britain-flooded http://www.channel4.com/programmes/is-our-weather-getting-worse http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-year-the-earth-went-wild http://www.channel4.com/programmes/up-in-smoke http://www.channel4.com/programmes/what-the-green-movement-got-wrong http://www.channel4.com/programmes/man-on-earth http://www.channel4.com/news/climate-change-kyoto-protocol-extensions-for-the-rich http://www.channel4.com/news/arctic-ice-levels-at-all-time-low http://www.channel4.com/news/energy-bill-the-short-term-cost-of-a-greener-future http://www.channel4.com/news/british-countryside-nature-wildlife http://www.channel4.com/news/whatever-happened-to-global-warming http://www.channel4.com/news/al-gore-uk-putting-business-before-green-short-sighted http://www.channel4.com/news/tom-clarke-in-the-arctic http://www.channel4.com/news/climate-change-environment-crisis
