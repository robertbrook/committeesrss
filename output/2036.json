"&#xa0;\nRocking the BOAT – Written evidence&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAmendments to \nThe\n Draft Deregulation Bill\n&#xa0;\nRocking the BOAT is a small local campaigning group formed following a public enquiry in February 2010 in which a little local lane known as \nChertpit\n Lane, from the village of Great \nLongstone\n, Derbyshire was classified as a Byway Open \nTo\n All Traffic or BOAT. The inspector at the time gave very little weight, if any to local public opinion, which was large over 90 residents attended the enquiry and the decision was based on historical evidence from ancient maps dating back 1650 and implied use of horse and carriage. Appeals to Derbyshire county council highways authority were made to implement a traffic regulation order without success, rocking the BOAT submitted a request in February 2012 for a traffic regulation order to the Peak District National Park Authority, the PDNPA are currently going through the public consultation process  \n&#xa0;\n Little or no credence was given to the current use of the lane by other soft user groups, walkers, runners, cyclists, horse riders, local education establishments, Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme and families and the dangers of making a small rural green track into a BOAT\n,  allowing\n legal use of the lane for recreational mechanical propelled vehicles and the loss of amenity and safety issues which come with it .\n&#xa0;\nChertpit\n Lane is a 1 mile long narrow (2m at narrowest) unsealed limestone lane with limestone dry stone walls either side the rout of the lane from Dale Farm a livery  rises to give extensive views of the peak district,  with access to \nLongstone\n Edge. The effect of the implementation of a BOAT on this local lane is a tragic loss of amenity to the local community, with the increased use of the lane by trail bikes, 4x4’s and quad bikes. This has had a dramatic affect on use by other soft user groups with usage being greatly reduced.\n&#xa0;\nSince the opening of \nChertpit\n Lane as a BOAT Derbyshire Highways Authority have seen it necessary to carry out repairs to the surface, initially in March 2011 which levelled a section of the lane for greater access for 4x4s but removed the character of the lane. In November 2012 further repairs were carried out to approximately 500m section which involved the resurfacing of the lane with road \nplanings\n, the charm and character of the \nlane  has\n now been completely altered, and now some 9 months since those repairs were completed the lane is once again in need of repair, due to the over use of the lane by recreational vehicles causing enhanced erosion. This is an unnecessary cost to the local tax payers and is unsustainable, with repairs being required on a regular basis\n. \nTo summarise in  3 ½ years since the re classification of \nChertpit\n lane to BOAT status it has gone from a tranquil grass covered lane, safe for all soft user groups to a dangerous, damaged, noisy tarmac  covered Lane, with a loss of amenity to the community and visitors to the Peak District.\nPlease view photographs attached \npages  2\n – 8, of damage caused by recreational vehicles and \nChertpit\n Lane in use by various user groups. \nChertpit\n Lane is not an \nexception  within\n the Peak District National Park with recreational vehicles  causing similar problems to communities thought the National Park.\n&#xa0;\nTo address these problems outlined above there is an opportunity for amendments to be made to the deregulation bill for green lanes to be given back to the communities for their quiet enjoyment.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n We \npropose :\n-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIn addition to the views of “rocking the BOAT” we expressly support the formal submissions made by The Green Lanes Environmental Action Group (GLEAM)\n,by\n the Green Lanes Protection Group (GLPG), by the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance (PDGLA) and the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance (YDGLA )\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDavid MacDonald\n&#xa0;\nChair rocking the BOAT\n&#xa0;\n15\nth\n September 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nChert\npit\n &amp; Leys Lane Record and Comparitive Pictures from 2010  to 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2010 \nA\n green lane\n              \n damage to wall footing   September 2012 \n&#xa0;\n1\nSeptember 2010 before DCC works\nSeptember 2010 4x4 on narrow section\nWalkers are trapped in front of the 4x4’s\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2010  A green lane\nSeptember2012\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2011  level surface\nSeptember 2012 Rutted &amp; lose surface\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2011 level surface\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n              \nSeptember 2011 Rutted &amp; lose stone surface\nOctober 2010 A green lane\n              \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2012\nDecember 2011 4x4 convoy \nDecember 2011 Oil deposits left \nby 4x4 convoy\n&#xa0;\nJuly 2012 Verge damage \nJuly 2012 4X4 tyre tracks tight to walls \nJuly 2012 Damage to wall adjacent to gate post     \nApril 2012 4x4 Tyre tracks over right verge/wall\n \nMarch 2012 4x4 come off the lane knock down wall\nMarch 2012 verge and wall damage\n&#xa0;\n \nMarch 2012 wall pushed over by 4x4\nApril 2011 Wall fall into lane\n \nJuly 2012 Conservation of Melancholy Thistle       \nMarch 2012 Tyre tracks against wall &amp; damage\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2012 \nLongstone\n Chase\nSeptember 2012 Cyclists avoid ruts\nNovember 2011 Cyclists &amp; 3xTrial bikes\n2012Trail Bike at \nspeed  at\n Dale Farm\nJune 2012 \nWaiting\n for convoy to pass\nMarch \n2012  9\n Trail bikes through narrow section\n&#xa0;\n \nJuly 2012 4X4 debris       \nJuly 2012 4x4 gouge marks\n&#xa0;\nAug 2013 tarmac \nplanings\n ware ruts\nAugust 2013 wear to \nplanings\n              \n              \n              \n              \n \n \nAugust 2013 Now a dangerous surface trail bike skid 15m long\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nAugust 2013 low visibility for fast moving trail bikes\nAugust 2013 Ware to \nplanings\n fused together\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n8\n&#xa0;\n Pictures not published here\n Picture not published here\n \nPicture not published here.\n \nPicture not published here.\n \nPicture not published here.\n \nPicture not published here.\n \nPicture not published here.\n \nPicture not published here.\n"
