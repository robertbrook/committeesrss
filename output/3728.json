"BRC26\n&#xa0;\nWritten submission from Mr Stephen Evans MIETDCLG Electrical Competent Person SchemeI have watched the video from the HOC Communities and Local Government Committee meeting held on the 2\nnd\n September 2013 and \nsubsequently \nsubmit my response to \nthis below.\n1. As I am broadly in agreement with what other contributors have so far submitted, I will refrain from repeating many of the points already raised. However, I would like to provide my views on the standards of training \nand changes to the\n regis\ntration system.\n2. \nTo briefly outline my knowledge of the industry, I am a\nn\n electrician\n with 40\n years of experience and have worked\n in both commercial and domestic environments\n and\n was\n \na \nPart P accredited\n contractor\n when it was first introduced.\n I am a ful\nl member of the IET (institution of Engineering and Technology) and a registered electrician at technician grade with the JIB.\n3. \nDuring the last 7 years I have mainly\n worked\n as a freelance trainer for both private training providers and FE Colleges. This work has involved delivery of courses for industry recognised qualifications relating to the IET wiring regulations\n (BS7671)\n and Inspection and Testing. In addition, I am a q\nualified NVQ assessor and verifier and have \nhelped\n many apprentices\n achieve the Level 3 NVQ that is recognised within the industry as the minimum \nstandard of competency.\n4. \nAs has been pointed-out by other contributors, one of the negative \naspects\n of Part \nP\n, which was initially welcomed by the trade as a way to improve standards,\n has been the\n way it’s\n been hijacked by\n private training providers offering very short courses \n(at very high prices\n)\n \nfor \nanyone\n to become \na domestic electrician\n.  And whilst domesti\nc electrical systems are the least technically challenging,\n they still require a high level of compe\ntency to be installed correctly and these\n skills certainly can’t be learnt in just a few weeks\n. Moreover, \nto make matters worse, \nthese short courses have be\nen encouraged by the various Part P scheme operators because they provide a \ngood \nsource for new members and \nan easy way to boost\n revenue\ns. \n5. \nUnfortunately, this is a classic case of a\n good idea having unintended consequences and t\nhe sad fact is that\n over\nall\n \nstandards of domestic electrical installation work have\n \nnot improved at all and in \nmany\n \ninstances\n are actually worse\n.  As mentioned above, I \nhave worked\n for a private training company who provided these courses\n and\n witnessed first-hand the \nfolly\n of this policy.  \n&#xa0;\n6. \nIn my opinion, and contrary to the wishes of the \ncurrent \naccreditation bodies\n, the\n way forward is \nto \nmove away from \nthe \nprofit based registration schemes and \nadopt a single \nsystem of accreditation\n - which\n the public can easily unders\ntand\n \nand\n \nsimilar to\n the \ngas industry \nmodel\n (Gas Safe)\n -\n whereby \nANY \nindividual working in the electrical industry must be suitably competent\n and assessed on a regular basis\n. \n It should also \nrequire all electricians to be \nsuitably qualified to \nthe \nstandards\n recognised by the JIB\n ECS scheme,\n wh\nich\n, in addition to \nrequiring the relevant \ntechnical \ncertificates\n, require\ns\n proof of\n suitable\n experience\n.\n7. \nI greatly welcome the DCLG \ncommittee’s \ninvestigation into this matter\n and strongly hope your conclusions are t\no recommend \na root-and-branch overhaul \nof the current accreditation system \nas\n currently\n it \nbenefits nobody except the scheme operators themselves.\n However, if this is not possible then\n at the very least\n,\n \nfor the sake of clarity, \na single register\n of\n all \ncertified \ninstallers should be adopted\n (or enforced by government) similar to that\n proposed by NAPIT\n.\n8. Finally, I was slightly dismayed that the committee did not challenge Emma Clancy’s claim that her organisation represents eighty percent of contractor\ns who carry-out ninety percent of all electrical work. This may be true for the electrical contracting industry\n as a whole\n but \nthe \nDCLG committee \nis only considering the domestic market and I would be surprised if this percentage claim was so high in this \nsegment of the industry?\nI trust you will find my above contribution of interest and if you think I can be of further assistance please don’t hesitate to contact me.\n24\n November 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
