"Written evidence from the Lymphoedema Support Network (LTC 10)&#xa0;\nSummary&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;3.1 \nPrevention.\nWhilst the primary \nform of \nlymphoedema\n cannot be prevented research suggests that in \nits\n secondary form, particularly in relation to breast cancer\n,\n quality patient information and e\narly intervention\ns can reduce the chance of developing lymphoedema or limit its consequences (\nTorres Lacomba M et al (2010). Effectiveness of early physiotherapy to prevent lymphoedema after surgery for breast cancer; a randomised, single blinded, clinical trial. BMJ; 340; B5396\n). This approach is reliant on both healthcare professionals and those at risk knowing about the\n \ncondition and risk reduction factors. The LSN produces a wide range of patient information that is available via NHS Choices and the Information prescription initiative. Patients who are in contact with the LSN report that many GPs and community and hospital nurses have an alarming lack of knowledge about the condition and it is certainly true that the recognition, prevention and management of lymphoedema is not a priority in nursing, medical or physiotherapy training programmes. Last year the LSN commissioned \na BMJ \neLearning\n module on the subject aimed at GPs. In the first 12 months 2\n,\n141 UK doctors/physicians had completed the unit and whilst that is pleasing it is against a total number of GPs approaching 31,000 all of whom will be responsible for the long term condition support of lymphoedema patients.\n3.2 \nTreatmentAlthough lymphoedema is not currently a curable condition\n,\n treatmen\nt\ns are available to reduce and control the associated swelling and skin changes and reduce the\n \nmost common\n \ncomplications of cellulitis and leaking fluid (lymphorrhoea) (\nKo DSC et al (1998) Effective treatment of lymphoedema of the \nextremities\n. Atch surgery; 133; 452-458). \nThese treatments include\n: \n- External compression – via multi-layer bandaging, intermittent pneumatic compression devices and, most commonly, compression garments.\n- Skin care\n- Exercise and movement\n- Specialised massage – manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) or a \nself-administered\n version of this called simple lymphatic drainage (SLD)\n3.3 \nEmerging technologiesNo drug therapies have proven to be consistently effective for most types of lymphoedema. \nA number of important new technologies are being developed which will influence the future management of the condition – these include genetic, new methods of compression, surgical techniques such as lymph node transplants, liposuction and low level laser therapy.\n&#xa0;4.1 \nCellulitisDue to the impact on the immune system that lymphoedema has\n,\n the most common complication of lymphoedema is cellulitis. This serious infection is a significant burden on the National Health Service. NHS Choices states that \n‘\nIn England in 2009, around 80,000 people were\n&#xa0;\nadmitted to hospital as a result of cellulitis.\n&#xa0;\nThe number of annual cases of cellulitis has increased three-fold over the past 15 years.’ The cost of hospital admission for cellulitis in Derbyshire, Nottingham and Lincolnshire was approximately £4.1 million in one year against a population of \nApprox.\n 2.5 million. An average admission for cellulitis associated with lymphoedema \nin the previously mentioned Wandsworth study was 12 days and an estimated cost of £2,300.\n&#xa0;4.2 \nImpact on the individualStudies have demonstrated the significant impact lymphoedema has on the lives of those living with it (\nTodd J et al\n (2011) Service user research into social difficulties and appearance concerns in lymphoedema secondary to cancer. Macmillan Cancer Support)\n In the previously mentioned Wandsworth study the following data was found, which is backed up by the Todd study and direct patient feedback from the Lymphoedema Support Network.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n80% of people with lymphoedema had to take time off work for treatment\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n8% had to stop work completely because of their lymphoedema\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n29% had experienced cellulitis in the previous year and 27% of these required hospital admission\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n50% of patients suffered uncontrolled pain\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n36% of people had received NO treatment for their condition.\n&#xa0;\nA case study by the \nL\nymphoedema\n \nS\nupport \nNetwork Nurse\n Advisor\n graphically demonstrated these issues. A 63 year old gentleman developed lymphoedema as a complication of long term venous leg disease – for 18 months his case had been overseen by the community nursing team who had struggled to manage extensive ulceration. Lymphorrhea and the emotional, physical and social burden of illness that the gentleman was living with. He was finally referred to a specialist lymphoedema service with the patient identified goals at commencement of treatment being ‘to stop smelly fluid leaking from my legs, to be able to play with my children again, to reduce my pain, to be able to get back to work and stop claiming benefits\n \nand to get my life back’. The cost of his medical treatment over these 18 months had been £20,560 and this did not include his benefits or other social costs. Following just 9 sessions of treatment, at a total cost of £1,041 the gentleman’s legs were no longer leaking, his pain was significantly reduced, his swelling had reduced from the original 63% larger to just 5% larger, he had been reinstated to his job and was no longer claiming benefits, he said he had his life back! – he also required no visits from community nursing teams and was being supported in his \non-going\n management by his GP.\n&#xa0;\n4.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLack of appropriate initial ass4essment and treatment as well as a failure to support long term management is undoubtedly costing the NHS both in direct terms and in staff time and resources as well as causing many lymphoedema patients to be claiming benefits and needing significant social services input due to reduced mobility, pain and infection.\n&#xa0;\nMay 2013\n"
