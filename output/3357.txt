[[[Joshua, on the effects of losing care]]]:&#xa0;“I was told that I no longer met the criteria… I can dress myself but I’ve had to give up wearing socks. I struggle with shoes and frequently have to ask friends, colleagues, family and even people on the street to rescue my shoes and put them back on when they fall off.”&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Amy, on what social care enables her to do]]]:&#xa0;“It’s about being able to have the same aspirations as others. I hold down a job, live independently and I am able to live life in the way I choose. I believe this is a fundamental right, but it has also given me an immense sense of freedom.”&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;15-minute care visits&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Commissioning&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Funding Social Care&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
