defaultGovernment response to the Justice Select Committee’s call for evidence: Ministry of Justice measures in the JHA opt-outdefault&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are seeking to rejoin those measures that underpin cooperation in the fight against organised crime and protect the British public. 
defaultWhile detailed analysis of each individual measure is included in the five Explanatory Memoranda contained in Command Paper 8671, I have set out more of the Government’s reasoning for wishing to rejoin a number of the 
defaultkey
default measures where the Ministry of Justice has responsibility: the Prison Transfer Framework Decision (PTFD)
default (number 85 on the list)
default, the European Supervision Order (ESO)
default (number 97)
default, the Data Protection Framework Decision (DPFD)
default (number 90)
default, and the Mutual Recognition of Financial Penalties Framework Decision (MRFP)
default (number 59)
default.   
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultPrisoner Transfer Framework Decision (PTFD)default&#xa0;defaultReducing the Foreign National Offender (FNO) population is a top priority for the Government. 
defaultAs a general rule the 
defaultUK
default believes prisoners reintegrate better into society upon their eventual release from prison if they serve their sentence in their country
default. I
defaultn addition
default,
default returning FNOs to serve sentences in their home countries will free up prison spaces and contribute towards savings
default. 
defaultOver the last ten years the 
defaultUK
default has witnessed an increase in the number of EU nationals detained within prisons in 
defaultEngland
default and 
defaultWales
default. The 
defaultUK
default is already party to a number of international prisoner transfer arrangements; however the 
defaultPTFD
default which came into force on 5 December 2011 is important in mitigating this increase as it permits Member States to transfer prisoners without the consent of the prisoner and restricts the grounds on which receiving Member States may refuse to accept transfers. It will enable non-British EU nationals held in prisons here to be returned to their country of nationality to serve their sentences and for British nationals held in other EU Member States to serve their sentences here.  There are currently around 4,000 EU nationals detained in 
defaultEngland
default and 
defaultWales
default which is 37% of the overall prison population.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultUK
default is beginning to see more EU nationals being removed from 
defaultUK
default prisons. So far we have transferred nine prisoners on a voluntary basis and have just completed the first four compulsory transfers (three of which have been transferred to the Netherlands, an EU Member State which has a large number of their nationals in UK prisons, and one to Malta). A further 22 transfer certificates have been referred to other EU jurisdictions and a further tranche of prisoners are under consideration for deportation by Home Office Immigration Enforcement. The PTFD has also allowed us to secure the return of five British national offenders (two from 
defaultItaly
default, two from 
defaultDenmark
default and one from 
defaultBelgium
default).
default&#xa0;
defaultThe EU PT
defaultFD
default, once fully implemented across all Member States, will allow us to more effectively seek the removal of EU FNOs, to serve the remainder of their sentence in their home country with or without their consent. This supports Government policy by enabling FNOs who have no right to remain in the 
defaultUK
default to be removed from the 
defaultUK
default at the earliest opportunity. 
defaultWe are actively encouraging those Member States that have not yet implemented to do so. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe measure is also an important part of the overall reform package for the 
defaultEuropean Arrest Warrant (
defaultEAW
default)
default. Where EAWs are issued for convicted 
defaultUK
default nationals to serve sentences abroad, we can make greater use of the PTFD to help ensure that more 
defaultUK
default nationals are able to serve their sentences in the 
defaultUK
default. As the Home Secretary announced on 9 July, this will mean asking the issuing state to withdraw the warrant and use Prisoner Transfer arrangements instead.
default This is clearly a more efficient use of resources and is in the interests of all concerned.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe use of the PTFD in this way 
defaultcould have prevented the
default&#xa0;
defaultunnecessary
default extraditions of Michael Binnington and Luke Atkinson – sent to 
defaultCyprus
default, only to be returned to the 
defaultUK
default six months later.
default 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultEuropean Supervision Order (ESO)default&#xa0;defaultThe ESO provides a legal framework which in certain circumstances will enable the court in the State where the crime is alleged to transfer the suspect back to their home Member State to await trial, and for the home 
defaultMember State 
defaultto assume responsibility for supervising compliance with any conditions of that bail
default (e.g
default.
default not contacting 
defaultalleged 
defaultvictims or certain witnesses, not visiting certain places, a curfew, surrender of passport etc).
default&#xa0;
defaultWhil
defaulte there is no real experience
default of the impact of the ESO because it has only recently come into force, the potential benefits of the ESO are clear. It will provide a new option for suspects, and the courts dealing with them, to allow those suitable to return home under conditional bail to be supervised there, rather than having to stay and be supervised in the 
defaultMember
default 
defaultState
default where they are accused. It might even allow some suspects who might otherwise be held on remand in the prosecuting 
defaultMember
default 
defaultState
default to be returned home under supervised bail conditions, meaning the prosecuting State can be safe in the knowledge that any bail conditions it considers necessary will be supervised in the suspect’s home 
defaultMember
default 
defaultState
default. The suspect, of course, gets to return home. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is also possible that the ESO might go some way to help avoiding
default&#xa0;
defaultlengthy pre-trial detention for some suspects surrendered under an EAW, as it will allow courts to bail the suspect back to the 
defaultUK
default while they await trial.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis could benefit requested persons where unconditional bail is considered inappropriate. For example, the case of Andrew Symeou is sometimes cited as one which might have benefited from an ESO if it had been available at the time. In this case Mr Symeou spent 10 months in pre-trial detention and a further nine months under locally supervised bail in 
defaultGreece
default. 
defaultThe ESO would have at least given the prosecuting court an alternative to remand or monitoring the bail of the suspect locally. 
defaultIn his review of 
defaultUK
default extradition, Sir Scott Baker
default 
defaultrecommended that the ESO could 
defaultplay a part in
default help
defaulting
default reduce lengthy pre
default-
defaulttrial detention
default for some suspects in some cases who might otherwise be held abroad and the Government agrees with that observation.

defaultData Protection Framework Decision default(DPFDdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe DPFD
default&#xa0;
defaultprovides for the protection of personal data in the area of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. It only applies to data which 
defaultis
default shared across borders, not domestically (for example it would apply in an exchange of data between UK and French police forces, but it would not apply to an exchange of data between the Metropolitan and Thames Valley police forces).  It applies to “competent authorities”, which in the 
defaultUK
default includes the police, Courts, the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) and many government departments. 
defaultA fully-functional law enforcement and criminal justice system within the EU needs to share data in an appropriate manner to protect the public and the rights of individuals. 
defaultThe DPFD achieves this well. It provides a flexible framework which is principles based and places minimum burdens on the criminal justice system. It ensures 
defaultUK
default citizens are protected while simultaneously allowing for the necessary data sharing on criminal matters. By participating in this measure the 
defaultUK
default ensures
default that law enforcement can effectively share data with EU partners without unnecessary red tape or costly burdens
default. 
defaultThe measure is considered “vital” by the Association of Chief Police Officers. In their evidence to the inquiry undertaken by the 
defaultHouse of 
defaultLords E
defaulturopean 
defaultU
defaultnion
default Committee they said “the 
defaultUK
default needs to remain a part of this measure. The reason is that other states may not agree to share such data with any other state under these provisions unless they remain within it”. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe DPFD additionally provides the data protection framework for many other 
defaultpost-Lisbon 
defaultEU JHA measures. These include the Child Sexual Exploitation Directive
default (2012/92/EU)
default, the Victims Directive
default (2012/29/EU) 
defaultand the 
defaultCybercrime Directive
default (2013
default/
default40/EU
default)
default. Participation in the DPFD therefore means that the 
defaultUK
default will be able to fully compliant with these instruments
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultMutual Recognition of Financial Penalties (MRFP)default&#xa0;
defaultThe MRFP ensures that offenders are not able to evade financial penalties
default&#xa0;
defaultsimply because they do not live in the 
defaultMember
default 
defaultState
default where they offend. The measure maintains
default&#xa0;
defaultany deterrent effect of a financial penalty even for people who are resident elsewhere in the 
defaultUnion
default. For example, visitors in the 
defaultUK
default from another 
defaultMember
default 
defaultState
default&#xa0;
defaultmay be less inclined to commit road traffic offences if they know they will likely still have to pay the resulting fine imposed for any offence. 
default&#xa0;defaultThe Framework Decision applies to fines, fines registered as a result of fixed penalty notices, compensation orders, victims surcharge and court costs.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe enforcing 
defaultMember
default 
defaultState
default that collects the financial penalty
default&#xa0;
defaultwill generally
default&#xa0;
defaultkeep it (other than compensation monies that
default&#xa0;
defaultwould generally be
default&#xa0;
defaultremitted back to the victim) as there are often costs associated with enforcement.
default&#xa0;
default The key aim of the measure

defaultbroaden the effectiveness of financial penalties imposed by Member States
