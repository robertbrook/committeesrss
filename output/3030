defaulthe UK Governm

defaultasked the Royal 
defaultSociety and the Royal Academy of Engineering to carry out an independent review of the scientific and engineering evidence relating to the technical aspects of the risks associated with hydraulic fracturing to inform government policymaking about shale gas
default extraction in the UK
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe terms of reference of this review were:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultA Working Group was
default set up to oversee this project. 
defaultThe Working Group met on six occasions when it was briefed by other experts. Consultations with other experts and 
defaultstakeholders were held between meetings. Submissions were received from a number of ind
defaultividuals and learned societies
default. 
defaultI am writing to you as a member of 
defaultthe
default Working Group, although I am writing in 
defaulta
default personal capacity and not necessary on behalf of the two
default academies. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOur key finding was that the 
defaulthealth, safety and environmental risks associated with hydraulic fracturing as a means to extract shale gas can be managed effectively in the UK as long as operational best practices are 
defaultimplemented and enforced t
defaulthrough regulation. 
defaultHydraulic fracturing is an established technology that has been used in the oil and gas industries for many decades. 
defaultThe UK has 60 years’
default experience of regulating onshore and offshore oil and gas industries.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe were keen to stress that
default s
defaulthale gas extraction in the UK is presently at a very small scale, involving only exploratory activities. Uncertainties can be addressed through robust monitoring systems and research activities identified in this report. 
defaultThere is greater uncertainty abou
defaultt the scale
default of production activities should a future shale gas industry develop 
defaultnationwide
default.
default 
defaultTherefore, our other key finding was that a
defaultttention must be paid
defaultto 
defaultthe way in which risks scale up
default. 
defaultCo-ordination of the numerous bodies with regulatory responsibi
defaultlities 
defaultfor shale gas extraction 
defaultmust be maintained. Regulatory capacity may need to be increased.
default&#xa0;
defaultConcerns have been raised about the risk of fractures propagating from shale formations to reach overlying aquifers. The available evidence indicates that th
defaultis risk is very low provided that shale gas extraction takes place at depths of many hundreds of metres or several kilometres. Geological mechanisms constrain the distances that fractures may propagate vertically. Even if communication with overlying aquif
defaulters were possible, suitable pressure conditions would still be necessary for contaminants to flow
default through fractures
default. More likely causes of possible environmental contamination include faulty wells, and leaks and spills associated with surface operations. N
defaulteither cause is unique to shale 
defaultgas. Both
default 
defaultare 
defaultcommon to all oil and gas wells and extractive activities.
default&#xa0;
defaultEnsuring well integrity must remain the highest priority
default to prevent contamination. 
defaultThe probability of well failure is low for a single well if it is designed, constructed and 
defaultabandoned
default according to best practice. The UK’s well examination scheme was set up so that the design of offshore wells could be reviewed by independent, specialist 
defaultexperts. This scheme must be 
defaultapplied appropriately
default for onshore activities. Effects of unforeseen leaks or spills can be mitigated by proper site construction and impermeable lining. Disclosure of the constituents of 
defaultfracturing fluid is already mandatory in
default the UK. Ensuring, where possible, that chemical additives are non-hazardous would help to mitigate the impact of any leak or spill.  
default&#xa0;
defaultConcerns have also been raised about seismicity induced by hydraulic fracturing. Natural seismicity in the UK is low by 
defaultworld standards. On average, the UK experiences seismicity of magnitude 5 M
defaultL
default (
defaultfelt by everyone nearby
default) every twenty years, and of magnitude 4M
defaultL
default 
default(felt by many people) 
defaultevery three to four years.
default 
defaultThe UK has lived with seismicity induced by coal mining activit
defaulties or the settlement of abandoned mines for a long time. British Geological Survey records indicate that coal mining-related seismicity is generally of smaller magnitude than natural seismicity and no larger than 4 M
defaultL
default. Seismicity induced by hydraulic frac
defaultturing is likely to be of 
defaulteven 
defaultsmaller magnitude. There is an emerging consensus that the magnitude of seismicity induced by hydraulic fracturing would be no greater than 3 M
defaultL
default (f
defaultelt by few 
defaultpeople and 
defaultresulting
default in 
defaultnegligible, if any, surface impacts).
default Recen
defaultt seismicity induced by hydraulic fracturing in the UK was of magnitude 2.3 M
defaultL
default and 1.5 M
defaultL 
default(unlikely to be
default felt by anyone)
default. The risk of seismicity induced by hydraulic fracturing can be reduced by traffic light monitoring systems that use real-time seismic 
defaultmonitoring so that operators can respond promptly. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMonitoring should be carried out before, during and after shale gas operations to inform risk assessments. Methane and other contaminants in groundwater should be monitored, as well as potential leakages
default of methane and other gases into the atmosphere. The geology of sites should be characterised and faults identified. Monitoring data should be 
defaultsubmitted to
default the UK’s regulators to manage potential hazards, inform local planning processes and address wider c
defaultoncerns. Monitoring of any potential leaks of methane would provide data to assess the carbon footprint of shale gas extraction. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultUK’s goal based approach to 
defaultregulation is to be commended
default, requiring o
defaultperators to identify and assess risks in a way that
default fosters innovation and continuous improvement in risk management
default.
default 
defaultThe UK’s 
defaulthealth and safety regulators and environmental regulators
default should work together to 
defaultdevelop
default guidelines specific 
defaultto
default shale gas extraction to help 
defaultoperators carry out goal based risk 
defaultassessments according
default to the principle of 
defaultreducing risks to As Low As Reasonably 
defaultPracticable (ALARP). 
defaultRisk assessments should be 
defaultsubmitted to the regulators for scrutiny and then 
defaultenforced through monitoring activities and inspections. It is mandatory for o
defaultperators to report 
defaultwell failures, as well as other accidents and incidents
default to the UK’s regulators. 
defaultMechanisms should be put in place so that reports can also be shared between operators to improve risk assessments and promote best practices across the indu
defaultstry
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultAn Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) should be mandatory for all shale gas operations. Risks should be assessed across the entire lifecycle of shale gas extraction, 
defaultincluding risks associated with the disposal of 
defaultwastes
default and 
defaultabandonment of wells
default. 
defaultSeismic risks should also feature as part of the ERA.
default&#xa0;
defaultWater requirements can be managed through integrated operational practices, such as recycling and reusing wastewaters where possible. Options for disposing of wastes should be planned from the outset. 
defaultShould 
defaultany onshore disposal wells
default be necessary in the UK, their 
defaultconstruction, regulation and 
defaultsiting
default would
default 
defaultneed
default further consideration.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe report did
default 
defaultnot attempt
default to determine whether 
defaultshale gas extraction
default should go ahead
default in the UK
default. This remains the 
defaultresponsibility of the Government. This report analysed the environmental, health and safety
default 
defaultrisks 
defaultassociated with shale gas extraction 
defaultto inform decision making. 
defaultNeither risks associated with the subsequent use of shale gas nor c
defaultlimate
default risks 
defaultwere
default analysed.
default 
defaultDecision making would benefit from research into the 
defaultclimate risks associated with 
defaultboth 
defaultthe extraction
default and use of shale gas. Further benefit would also be derived from research into the public acceptability of 
defaultall
default 
defaultthese 
defaultrisks in the context of the UK’s en
defaultergy, climate and economic policies.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn December 2012, the Secretary of State for Energy informed the House of Commons that the temporary suspension on shale gas activities in the UK would be lifted. In the same speech, he added that he ‘
defaulthad the 
defaultbenefit o
defaultf the comprehensive and authoritative review of the risks of 
defaultfracking
default by the Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering 
default...
default. I can announce that the Government accepts all the recommendations of the ac
defaultademies’ report addressed to it’.
default  The Secretary o
defaultf State 
default‘
defaultplaced in the Libraries of both Houses and placed on my Department’s website a full synopsis of the questions raised and of the Government’s responses to them as well as a response on all of the recommendation
defaults of the academies’ study group’. The 
defaulttwo academies have been liaising with government, industry and regulatory officials to discuss how the recommendations are to be implemented.
