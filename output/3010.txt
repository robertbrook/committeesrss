[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;Written evidence from the South East Local Transport Board (SRN 024)&#xa0;&#xa0;The South East Local Transport Board (SELTB) welcomes this opportunity to provide input to the Select Committee’s Inquiry into the Strategic Road Network (SRN).&#xa0;The SELTB is working closely with the South East Local Enterprise Partnership (SELEP), local authorities and businesses in the preparation of SELEP’s Strategic Economic Plan. The LEP-wide growth priorities emerging from this work clearly require a high quality SRN to provide real and direct economic benefits. &#xa0;The SELTB shares the concerns of its Local Transport Authorities in relation to Highways Agency procedures in relation to the delivery of schemes and attracting private sector funding. In its separate submission to the Committee, Kent County Council has provided examples of how private sector funding may be secured and where Local Transport Authorities could provide schemes on the SRN more efficiently and cost effectively than the Highways Agency. The SELTB is of the opinion that similar examples could be provided across the UK.&#xa0;In the context of the set questions the SELTB offers the following responses.&#xa0;&#xa0;Highways Agency schemes generally have been motor vehicle-centric with little regard to other users apart from the need to safely accommodate them. Any policies that will result in greater emphasis given on encouraging sustainable transport would be welcome. However, at a very recent stakeholders meeting with the Highways Agency and their consultants relating to the proposed improvements at the M25/A13 Junction 30, consideration for non-motorised modes on the A13 appear to have been minimal in developing the scheme.  Whilst new policies to “maximise green gains”, “decarbonising roads” and providing a “network for walkers and cycles” are welcomed, the SELTB has reservations about the extent to which these will be delivered.&#xa0;&#xa0;The answer to the previous question also relates to this question. In addition the SELTB welcomes the current engagement on the Route Based Strategies and anticipates that this may be a means to provide useful input to enable the link between roads policy and planning for other transport modes. It is good to see the traditional stand of seeking to over-protect the trunk road network moderated by the need to stimulate economic development. This is to be encouraged and applauded. However, further work is required, for example policies such as Circular 02/2013 need relaxing to encourage the delivery of schemes that would stimulate development, economic growth and job creation; thus allowing the SRN to play its full part in supporting regeneration and economic prosperity. The standard practice of automatically issuing holding notifications on schemes gives uncertainty to developers who immediately conclude there are problems in delivering their schemes. In relation to the threshold for intervention being related to when there may be “severe” impacts, without any definition of what “severe” means, adds further uncertainty at this time when the viability of schemes is a concern. Currently there are concerns about the unreasonably high level of contributions initially sought by the Highways Agency for S106/S278 agreements. An example of this is a new warehouse development at Tilbury for which the Highways Agency initially sought a contribution of £1m. Following discussions with Thurrock Council this was reduced to a more reasonable amount of £100k. The initial figure sought clearly could have unnecessarily made the scheme unviable and stopped this job-creating development had Thurrock Council not intervened.&#xa0;&#xa0;The SELTB recognises that we live in a changing economic world resulting in uncertainties in forecasting traffic growth. The SELTB would advise the Government to remain transparent in its processes and the assumptions it has made in its modelling, and undertake regular reality checks on its forecasts. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The Government has made steps forward in embracing technology such as the introduction of Managed Motorways and the provision of traffic information to drivers. The SELTB supports the Government’s proposals to further develop such technology to reduce congestion, improve safety and to increase journey-time reliability.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;        The introduction of funding certainty over a longer period would attract new investors together with more flexibility on the development and delivery of schemes. The SELTB’s Local Transport Authorities can provide examples of where they could be delivering Highways Agency schemes more efficiently and cost-effectively and how private sector funding may be secured. Kent County Council’s separate submission to the Committee provides examples of these. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;        The SELTB recommends that the Government listens to the stakeholders’ concerns and action is taken to allow local delivery of major road schemes, provide greater flexibility in policies governing Highways Agency procedures, and take a more proactive approach to attracting private sector funding to deliver schemes and improve the SRN.&#xa0;Thurrock Council’s Director of Planning and Transportation, David Bull, would be pleased to represent the SELTB and provide oral evidence at a Select Committee hearing on this matter. &#xa0;October 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
