[[[s (DWB 08)]]]&#xa0;The Federation of Small Businesses Wales welcomes the opportunity to present its views to the Welsh Affairs Committee on the draft Wales Bill. FSB Wales is the authoritative voice of small businesses in Wales. With 10,000 members, a Welsh Policy Unit, two regional committees and twelve branch committees; FSB Wales is in constant contact with small businesses at a grassroots level.  It undertakes a monthly online survey of its members as well as an annual membership survey on a wide range of issues and concerns facing small business.&#xa0;

[[[n]]]&#xa0;FSB Wales has been heavily involved with the Commission on Devolution in Wales (Silk Commission). In order to inform our responses to both parts of the Silk Commission, FSB Wales undertook four consultation events with members across Wales, two in North Wales and two in South Wales. This enabled us to submit informed positions on both parts of the Silk Commission’s work and to engage fully in the details of the Welsh devolution settlement.&#xa0;

[[[l]]]&#xa0;FSB Wales broadly welcomes the draft Wales Bill and believes it largely reflects the recommendations of the Silk Commission, which were based on a strong body of evidence. However, there are a number of areas that need to be addressed or clarified in relation to the Bill as it passes through Parliament. They are as follows:&#xa0;

[[[ ]]]The draft Wales Bill appears to contain no reference to the full devolution of Non-Domestic Rates, despite the Explanatory Memorandum stating; “The draft Bill also implements the Commission’s recommendation to fully devolve business rates in Wales”.1 As both the Silk Commission part one report and the UK Government’s response note, legislation relating to Business Rates is already devolved under the Government of Wales Act 2006, although the wording relates only to ‘local government finance’. This ambiguity has led to a situation where it is not clear which mechanism will enable the full devolution of business rates and whether this will be as the result of initiation from Welsh Government or the UK Government.&#xa0;While the Scottish experience is not directly transferable to Wales due to the important differences between reserved and conferred models of devolution, the Scotland 1998 Act has a far more explicit wording on this matter, stating in an exception to a reservation on financial and economic matters; “Local taxes to fund local authority expenditure (for example, council tax and non-domestic rates)”2. FSB Wales suggests that the draft Wales Bill could be amended to create a similar explicit statement to provide clarity. This could be done either by amending Schedule 7 paragraph 12 of the Government of Wales Act 2006 to include wording similar to the Scotland Act 1998 or by placing non-domestic rates explicitly&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;1 Draft Wales Bill.

This would be carried out with agreement from both the Welsh and UK Governments.&#xa0;

[[[ ]]]FSB Wales has been supportive of the income tax proposals outlined in the Silk Commission’s recommendations noting that income tax is also a form of business tax for many of our self-employed members. However, FSB Wales believes the ‘lock-step’ model proposed in the draft Bill is ill suited for devolution. FSB Wales believes the lock-step model is unlikely to be used by the current or future Welsh Governments as it does not provide sufficient flexibility in policy decision making. For instance, a policy of reducing the higherrate of taxation could be examined under the Silk Commission’s original proposals that couldprove beneficial to our members.&#xa0;This is significant because the availability of capital borrowing powers is contingent on the level of income tax devolution available to the Welsh Government, following a successful referendum. The lock-step model is less attractive and would therefore discourage the Welsh Government from pursuing devolution and the additional capital borrowing powers that would accompany it.&#xa0;

[[[ ]]]The Silk Commission recommended the devolution of Air Passenger Duty (APD) on short haul flights; bringing Wales into line with Northern Ireland’s current competencies. FSB Wales was disappointed not to see further consideration of this issue as was the case with Stamp Duty Land Tax and believes devolution of this tax would be beneficial to businesses in Wales. Our position remains that the rationale behind fiscal autonomy is the potential to create attractive differences in tax policy in Wales. FSB Wales maintains that Air Passenger Duty has similar characteristics to Stamp Duty Land Tax, including an immobile tax base, and is therefore suitable for devolution to Wales. The decision to omit APD for short haul flights in the Wales Bill is therefore counterintuitive.&#xa0;

[[[n]]]: FSB Wales notes that the Silk Commission recommended Corporation Tax should be devolved to Wales only if similar devolution occurs in Northern Ireland and Scotland. The Commission also stated in recommendation 9 that there should be a presumption in favour of devolution for any new UK taxes3. While FSB Wales members consulted in our initial response were undecided on whether Corporation Tax should be devolved they felt Wales should not be at a competitive disadvantage if similar opportunities were to arise in Scotland and Northern Ireland. This necessitates a mechanism within the Wales Bill for adding additional taxes to the Welsh Government and National Assembly’s remit. FSB Wales believes this should be included in the Wales Bill.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;3 Commission on Devolution in Wales. 2012. Empowerment and Responsibility: Financial Powers to StrengthenWales .

[[[ ]]]While not recommending the devolution of Corporation Tax or National Insurance Contributions, the Silk Commission did suggest in recommendations 14 and 15 that the Welsh Government should be able to fund differential reliefs in Wales4. Both these recommendations were accepted by the UK Government. This could be used for instance to provide capital allowances in enterprise zones, or a targeted reduction in employer NICs to accompany schemes such as Jobs Growth Wales. This could provide a more efficient means of supporting the employment of targeted groups. While recognising that welfare issues are not devolved, such an approach would allow the Welsh Government the flexibility to stimulate employment and job creation in a targeted way.&#xa0;FSB Wales would like further clarification on the mechanism that would allow this to take place. If primary legislation is required to enable this to happen then this should be done through the Wales Bill. Recommendation 10 also suggested that the Welsh Government should be able to fund tax reliefs on other taxes in agreement with the UK government5. This issue should be considered by the Committee.&#xa0;

[[[ ]]]The Silk Commission suggested any new fiscal powers should be accompanied by appropriate treasury capacity in Wales. While this is largely a matter for the Welsh Government, FSB Wales has previously argued that far more robust economic statistics are needed on the Welsh economy to inform decision making on tax changes. For instance, the Scottish Government will receive identical tax powers under the Scotland Act 2012 but has a number of economic publications to aid its decision making such as; Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland, quarterly GDP figures and significant input output data developed under the Scottish National Accounts Project6. All this enables tax changes to be modelled and better informs decision making. FSB Wales would argue similar provision should be made for Wales.&#xa0;Returning to the draft Wales Bill, FSB Wales would like to see the Bill amended to include provisions for Tax Impact Assessments. This would seek to adopt best practice in assessing the impact of policy measures in a similar way to Regulatory Impact Assessments as specified under the Government of Wales Act 2006 for all Welsh legislation. Ideally, the process governing this would be thorough, including early implementation in the decision making process and well resourced analysis with independent input to ensure impacts are properly measured. However, FSB Wales recognises that the exact impact assessment process would be a matter for the Welsh Government and not for the draft Wales Bill.&#xa0;
