"&#xa0;\nThe Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI) has over 23,000 members who work in the public, private, v\noluntary and education sectors.\n It is a charity \nwhose\n purpose\n is\n to develop the art and science of town planning for the benefit of the public. \nT\nhe RTPI develops and shapes policy affecting the built environment, works to raise professional standards and supports members through continu\nous education, practice advice, training and development.\n&#xa0;\nUp and down the country planners are working on the creation of rou\nnded communities \ntogether \nwith the homes, \njobs \nand facilities \nthey need. The centralisation of most investment decisions by the public sector and regulated industries causes delay and \nmakes it harder to deliver \nplans to \nshape and \nimprove individual places.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThere is merit in choosing \nfunctional economic areas\n, for example \ntravel to work\n areas\n for devolution\n. In practice \nmany of \nthe areas of local enterprise partnerships have a lot to recommend them – voluntary formation, suitable size, and some institutional memory. However some solution to the issue of overlapping LEPs \nis\n needed.\n \nWe note that the areas of LEPs bear some resemblance to the areas proposed by the Royal (Redcliffe-Maud) \nCommission on Local Government \nin 1969. It is interesting that associations based on voluntary cooperation can resemble areas drawn up by technical exp\nerts\n.\nOur forthcoming policy paper on strategic planning (mid 2014) will address how planning over areas larger than a single local authority could best be undertaken.\n Some key issues such as housing and waste need solutions at subnational level. \nT\nhe use o\nf larger areas makes the scope for initiatives for investment now to save later easier. \nThis is because savings in one sectoral budget may only be realised by investments in another. Larger areas \ncould be\n more able to absorb the peaks and troughs on spendi\nng involved.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe right public services \n(and other functions, including \npolicy making\n) \nshould be delivered at the right level.  There is substanti\nal sco\npe for devolution of services c\nurrently administered by Whitehall; however a subregional level is not necessarily the only level to which they might be devolved.  Individual local authorities may also be suitable\n, as indeed may areas larger than subr\negions, depending on the function\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThere are some advantages in allowing\n \nfor a variety of forms of governance of devolved areas so \nas to \nenable them to choose.  \nProf\nessor\n Janice Morphet\n of University College London\n has identified several possible \ncurrent \nmodels\n:\nJoint Committee set up by two or more local authorities using 1972 Local Government Act s101. It would have directly elected councillors (not necessarily lea\nders) as members and it can pool part or all of any powers or services for which the constituent local authorities are responsible including planning, transport, waste, environment, regeneration. Once policies and powers are pooled, all decisions must be t\naken by the joint committee and cannot be taken again in any of the individual local authority member authorities i.e. principle of one vote per issue remains. A joint committee can be set up quickly; local authority experience of using this approach \nis \nco\nnsiderable; \nit is \neasy to use once established; \nand there is \nclear accountability\n. On the other hand decisions taken by a group of l\nocal authorities\n may not suit an individual \none\n so \nthere \nneed\ns to be\n good pre-decision processes. \n&#xa0;\nCombined Authority under\n the\n Local Democracy etc Act 2009. The \nmembership would probably be\n \ncouncil leaders or directly elected mayors. It needs consent of the Secretary of State. Once policies and powers are pooled, all decisions must be taken by the combined authority and canno\nt be taken again in any of the individual local authority member authorities i.e. principle of one vote per issue remains. It is the model preferred by the Coalition government so it is more likely to be supported through funding devolution. \nThis\n is \nhoweve\nr quite \ntime consuming to set up.\n&#xa0;\nSupervisory Board such as\n proposed by Lord Heseltine for Greater Birmingham and Solihull LEP\n.  It would comprise local authorities represented by their leaders. Again once powers pooled, they cannot be taken \nback \nagain b\ny the authorities. It is easy to set up and establishes a clear local authority relationship to the LEP. On the other hand there is no clear legal route so this would need to be discussed; it is unlikely to work on informal basis\n.\n&#xa0;\nA City Deal under \nno spe\ncific domestic legislation but with links to the 2009 Lisbon Treaty and the 2011 EU Directive on Cohesion Policy 2014-2020\n. Requires bid to central government and appears to involve a fair amount of working behind the scenes, which can appear excluding.\n&#xa0;\nThe question of \nbusiness involvement is critical. We note that the CBI has \nexpressed concern at the multiplicity of arrangements (eg LEPs running alongside City Deals) in the context of the capacity of business people to engage\n. One benefit of a more devo\nlved structure for economic growth and housing could be easier business involvement.\n \nHowever however increased variety does add complexity for business and other \nstakeholders who need to engage across the country. Other European countries tend to adopt mor\ne uniform models of devolution.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSee our response to question 3.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe RTPI has for some time been concerned that the current arrangements for securing development on the ground in our local areas are highly unsatisfactory. \nD\nue to the privatisation of utilities and transport operators and the\n parallel creation of multiple\n \ngovernment agencies (HCA, Environment, Nature, Heritage) \nit has been getting harder to get\n decision makers who have the power to control resources to \nwork\n together to get sites off the ground\n and things to happen locally\n. Decisions on releasing resources \nand also making vital compromises necessary to achieve development frequently have to be referred to head offices at national level (or \neven \nboard rooms in other countries).  Decision makers have multiple other priorities \nand drivers: \n achieving development in given localities are not one of them\n.\n&#xa0;\nSome of our own work with partners has provided recent demonstrations of the difficulties local areas face in making jobs and housing growth happen.  For example the RTPI is a member of a pri\nvate-led partnership, the Local Infrastructure Demonstrators Pilots Programme, along with the Civil Engineering Contractors’ Association and the Department for Business Innovation and Skills\n,\n which aims to progress stalled local projects with the potential\n to release economic growth. This process has been strongly informative in relation to the difficulties faced by local areas in achieving their objectives. Some of the difficulties stem from the centralised nature of investment decisions in government\n, its\n agencies and in privatised utility and transport companies (many of whose decisions are even made outside the country, let alone in London)\n.\n&#xa0;\nIn Northamptonsh\nire, County Council staff have \npointed out to us  that there are two key barriers: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNorthamptonshire is a county with clear and a\nmbitious plans for growth\n: there are over 35000 homes with planning permission, with potential for over 80000 homes. There is scope for 70000 additional jobs. But there are significant infrastructure gaps. Bridg\ning these is difficult in a climate of reduced public spending (especially on \ni\nnvestment\n as \nopposed to welfare) culture of bidding for and dependency on central funds,  and both local (local authority/LEP) silos and national silos (BIS, CLG, etc). The solution the County Council has come up with is a Revolving Infrastructure Fund which propos\nes to  pool the various schemes which could be used for the overall infrastructure investment needed in the area ie Community Infrastructure Levy, New Homes Bonus, Business Rates, Get Britain Building Fund, Growing Places Fund, Local Infrastructure Fund, R\negional Growth and Local Major Transport Scheme funding).  The aim is to be able to use this large combination of funds to repay loans used to construct key road schemes such as on the A45 and A43 trunk roads. Over a 20-year period (in the case of the A45)\n the year-end debt balance would be zero. However this solution was (July 2013) not yet authorised and required a complicated set of sign-offs from a series of different central authorities. It would also leave the County Council with potentially some cons\niderable risks, which increases the cost of borrowing and may cause problems with securing agreement from financial controllers. One may surmise that a single pot of funding would greatly assist here.\n&#xa0;\nThe issue of how to energise local growth has been the\n concern of other initiatives. The Local Government Association and the British Property Federation ran a year-long project in 2011-12 to look at how local authorities’ aspirations for growth could be \nrealised\n.  One conclusion was that “government should \nenable more decisions regarding the funding of local infrastructure to be taken locally”. For example in relation to \nCornwall, there has been concern that the fragmentation\n of and delay to spending decisions pertaining to investment for growth has slowed c\nonsiderably the rate of development and also caused valuable opportunities in the pre 2008 period to be lost. For example it took \nover 10 years to obtain the necessary funding to deliver a major new road scheme that will provide access to 64 acres of devel\nopment land and create more than 5,000 new jobs and 6,000 homes in the Camborne, Pool and Redruth area.\n This development proposal\n was originally initiated in an \nUrban Framework Plan in 2001. Cornwall County Council said “we firmly believe that if more deci\nsions regarding the funding of local infrastructure were taken locally it would accelerate the delivery of major regeneration projects”.\n&#xa0;\nMany commentators have referred to not only the multiplicity of bodies involved in development needed for homes and jo\nbs, but also to the variety of unrelated funding streams.  This is not confined to the present Coalition government. For example in Hull  there were over \n20\n \nstrategic partnerships, policy statements and local delivery vehicles\n set up in response to central\nly-determined policy initiatives, sometimes even arising in the same government department\n. \nThis produced a number of challenges:\n• Varying timespans.\n• Varying geographies eg neighbourhood, city, subregion \n• Scale of operation: long term large capital \nfunding projects and short term regeneration\nprojects \n• Widely varying organisational structures which also change over time (eg an urban regeneration company to an economic development company\n• Succession planning\n&#xa0;\nDue to the orchestration of these vari\nous national programmes at national level the experience on the ground \nin Hull was\n disconnected and unsatisfactory. For example “housing conditions might have been improved through a housing market renewal pathfinder, but better health facilities and schoo\nls may not be programmed through LIFT and BSF programmes for delivery towards the end of the next decade”. \n This kind of sectoral allocation of funds misses the opportunities for different sectors to benefit each other mutually and to accrue positive feedb\nack. \nOur recent paper on \nDelivering Large Scale Housing \n \n and on transport infrastructure\n  both testify to the complex nature of development and the requirement for a variety of sectors to pull together to achieve growth. \nSimilar experiences are reporte\nd from Birmingham City Council\n.\n We would \nalso \nrecommend reconsideration of the findings from the Total Place exercise conducted by government and va\nrious local authorities 2008-10\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nSome evidence of the restriction that strong centralisation and departmental fragmentation \nimposes on \nto local growth can be adduced from comparisons with countries where there is more local control of investment streams.\n “\nAn interesting example is Amersfo\nort in the central part of the\n \nNetherlands. There are three major town extension schemes being implemented. The\n \nmunicipality, through the planning process, set out the vision and master planned the projects.\n \nIn the case of Vathorst, this is a 20-year proje\nct that when completed will comprise 11,000\n \nhomes (30% of which will be social housing), a new shopping centre, a railway station and an\n \noffice/business park. The municipality (which owned roughly half of the site) set up a\n \ndevelopment company as a joint v\nenture with five private landowners and developers. The\n \ncompany was able to access low cost loans with the help of the council to ensure that the\n \ninfrastructure was put in at an early stage. The municipality planned, organised and project\n \nmanaged this aspe\nct of the development.\n”\n&#xa0;\n“\nCouncils \n[in other European countries] \nare able to undertake activities unless specifically prohibited by legislation. There are also relatively high degrees of financial autonomy as well as fiscal incentives such as retaining \nincreased property taxation income from the effects of new housebuilding. Urban regeneration in British cities would be more effectively co-ordinated if local government was less constrained because of legislation and the inability to raise funds.\n”\n&#xa0;\nResea\nrch led by Professor Michael Parkinson as part of the ESPON Programme\n suggests a positive correlation between decentralisation and innovation, with cities in Federal and Nordic systems performing better in terms of patent numbers. The research also reinforces the assertion that decentralisation has an impact on economic per\nformance. Germany has the most decentralised policy-making system in Europe and also has one of the most balanced urban growth systems: “its key features are the levels of decentralisation, commitment to long term planning and action, the allocation of pow\ners to regional and urban authorities, the focus upon innovation, education, research and development.”\n&#xa0;\nThe \nESPON \nstudy also looks at Leeds and suggests that the city would have been “more successful if there had been more decentralisation of powers”. It \nasserts that economic growth would have been greater had there been devolution of power – the lack of a coherent strategic industrial and innovation policy and support for public transport infrastructure have been particular hindrances. The research conclu\ndes with the recommendation that Leeds “would be helped in its post-recession strategy for growth by a national policy framework that involves genuine devolution of powers as part of a broader programme for rebalancing the economy.”\nAccording to the Heselt\nine Review \n, the\n United Kingdom (UK) has highly centralised government in comparison to other OECD countries. \nL\nocal government in the UK accounts for 30%\n of public spending\n, whereas in the US and Sweden local government accounts for almost half. Denmark a\nnd Canada’s local governments account for 70% of public expenditure. The negative consequences of disempowering local governments are not just confined to \nlocal areas\n; \nthe Heseltine review also provides information on international competitiveness \n.\n&#xa0;\n It w\nould appear that \nalthough the UK ranks quite highly in the majority of \nworld\n rankings \nof competitiveness\n, typically \nthe\n countries that are more competitive than the UK are those countries with comparably more government expenditure taking place at local le\nvel. \nF\nurther decentralisation would \npotentially enable \nUK competitiveness\n&#xa0;\nto rise further up the rankings\n given the benefits experienced in countries with more decentralised expenditure\n.\n&#xa0;\nT\nhe OECD surveyed\n 24 distinct global regions deciphering what successful and unsuccessful regions hold in common\n. One characteristic of the more successful regions is “the deliberate adoption of a horizontal approach to regional development focused on better coordination \nof sectoral policies and \nmobilisation\n of local assets and resources rather than reliance on external support”. Of the 24 regions surveyed, 12 regions displayed above average growth, and two thirds of that group \nadjusted policies \nto local assets rather than\n using policies passed through a centralised government, and embraced cross-border co-operation beyond administrative boundaries.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe system currently being promoted by the Coalition gov\nernment is based on competition between areas for both funds and powers at the same time. There are drawbacks to a system based on bidding, which are that the areas which may be most in need of support may also be those which have less capacity to mount go\nod bids. In all areas the resources available for \n any \n function which is not front line service delivery are intensely squeezed. This may be of particular concern to \nrural areas with dispersed populations. \n&#xa0;\nThe Smith Institute has reported on current arr\nangements to East Midlands Councils and concluded that “if funds are awarded to areas that happen to have the most developed capacity to bid successfully, rather than necessarily the strongest case in terms of need and opportunity, then that investment wil\nl have a less than optimal impact, as well as reinforcing entrenched \ninequalities\n”\n Yet in the UK as a whole there is already a formula-based system of devolution to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, so the principle of a non-bidding system has been ac\ncepted. \n&#xa0;\nGiven the variable geometry arising from a bidding system,\n \nWhitehall departments and their agencies \nwill\n need to become astute in undertaking negotiations with the devolved areas regarding cross border issues. Probably the most serious of these would be matters of housing, transport and economic growth across the boundary of Greater London.  As things curren\ntly stand, the appetite for effective joint working to be rewarded by devolution is weakest in the parts of England adjoining London. Unless this changes, it poses serious challenges to planning the area which produces nearly 40% of UK GDP.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nGoing further with the current bidding system \n(despite its disadvantages) \nwould have the \nbenefit\n of providing opportunities for increased capacit\ny building and also sharing of best practice from areas with more evolved levels of cooperation. However given the time required to instigate more fundamental reform it would be preferable for \nthe two processes to take place in paralle\nl\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe continued \nsqueeze on local authority capacity and resources may result in some areas exploring fundamental change (such as Shropshire did recently, choosing voluntary unitary status). Likew\ni\nse the constraints on resour\nc\nes and capacity in \nWhitehall \n \nwill necessitate \nnew approaches, greater departmental alignment and hopefully more devolution and empowerment.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;As the Local Government Association has indicated\n, t\nhe long term \nfinancial \nsustainability of local government in its current fo\nrm is \nenormously challenging\n. A recent past in which high levels of centralisation have been combined with (and to an extent justified by) high levels of central government spending looks likely to be gone for some time, if not for good. Alternatives could\n include more ability to raise \nand allocate \nmoney locally, with taxing land in one form or other being a possibility. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFor \nfurther details please contact Richard Blyth, Head of Policy, Practice and Research\n:\n \n020 7929 8178 \nrichard.blyth@rtpi.org.uk\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nRoyal Town Planning Institute\nThe RTPI is a charity registered in England (262865) and Scotland (SC 037841)\n&#xa0;\n9 January 201\n4\n&#xa0;\n                           \npage \n1 \nPers comm June 2013\n \nhttp://centreofenterprise.\nc\nom/2013/03/15/greater-birmingham-project/\n \n \nhttp://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2013:0146:FIN:EN:pdf\n \n \nThe UK’s Growth Landscape\n, CBI,\n October 2012\n \nUnlocking Growth Through Partnership\n, BPF and LGA, 2012\n \nhttp://www.dmu.ac.uk/documents/business-and-law-documents/research/cchr/researchpaper3coordinatingregeneration-improvingeffectivenessinlocaldelivery.pdf\n RTPI, September 2013\n RTPI, forthcoming January 2014\n Waheed Nazir \nDelivering the growth agenda:\n The experiences of Birmingham City Council \n Paper delivered at the 41\nst\n Oxford Joint Planning Law Confer\ne\nnce, September 2013\n \nSee for example\n: \n \nhttp://www.localleadership.gov.uk/totalplace/news/pilots-final-reports/\n \n \nas footnote 6\n \nhttp://www.dmu.ac.uk/documents/business-and-law-documents/research/cchr/researchpaper3coor\ndinatingregeneration-improvingeffectivenessinlocaldelivery.pdf\n Secondary Growth Poles and Territorial Development in Europe Final Report (2012): \nhttp://www.espon.eu/export/sites/default/Documents/Projects/AppliedResearch/SGPTD/SGPTD_Final_Report_-_Final_Version_27.09.12.pdf\n \n \nLord Heseletine:\nNo Stone Unturned, BIS, 2012 p 29\n \nibid\n p 16\n \nOrganisation for \nEconomic Cooperatio\nn and Development: \nPromoting \n&#xa0;\nGrowth in All Regions: Lesso\nns from across the OECD\n, Paris, 2012. \n \nD Gilhespy and R Clark \nHousing and Growth in the East Midlands \n, Smith Institute, September 2012\n18\n \nSee for example\n \nLGA briefing for the \nWestminster Hall \ndebate on the financial sustainability of local government 7 Jan 2014\n"
