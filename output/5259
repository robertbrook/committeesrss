&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Written evidence submitted by the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO) (BTO0028)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Yes.  SaBTO has worked with the UK blood services, the UK health departments and the 
[normal]r
[normal]egulators to ensure that UK policies on who can donate blood and blood products, tissues and organs are evidence-based.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]For example we provided advice on the donor deferral of men who have had sex with men in relation to blood donation in 2011 and in relation to tissue and cell donation in 2013.  Our advice, which is based on the UK evidence base, has been accepted and implemented in England, Scotland and Wales.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]No.  The UK blood services are required to meet the requirements of the Blood Safety and Quality Regulations 2005, which derive from requirements set by a number of EU Directives.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]SaBTO supports the UK blood services
[normal]’ approach to donor selection
[normal] 
[normal]that
[normal],
[normal] within the regulatory structure
[normal],
[normal] ensure
[normal]s
[normal] that evidence based donor 
[normal]deferral and exclusion 
[normal]policies are appropriate for the UK donor population.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]SaBTO currently provides robust independent scientific evidence based advice to Government on matters within the Committee
[normal]’
[normal]s remit (attached at A
[normal]ppendi
[normal]x A).  Details of current members and their short biographies are at A
[normal]ppendi
[normal]x B.  Advice from SaBTO is provided to all four UK health departments.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]SaBTO was established in 2008, replacing a previous committee with a narrower remit
[normal],
[normal] the 
[normal]Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Blood, Tissues &amp; Organs for Transplantation (MSBTO).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]SaBTO works closely with other committees where interests are common, including the National Expert Panel on New and Emerging Infections (NEPNEI) and the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP).
[normal] 
[normal]In addition, SaBTO does not only rely on the (considerable) experience of its 
[normal]constituent
[normal] members. 
[normal] 
[normal]Rather, 
[normal]SaBTO’s key working method 
[normal]is to establish
[normal] short term working groups 
[normal]that comprise both 
[normal]SaBTO members and additional experts
[normal] outside SaBTO. 
[normal] 
[normal]This has been particularly effective in enabling SaBTO to work responsively, effectively, and with a wide evidence base. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]SaBTO papers and minutes of meetings are publically available, redacted where appropriate for reasons 
[normal]such as
[normal] commercial confidentiality, at:
[normal]https://www.gov.uk/government/policy-advisory-groups/advisory-committee-on-the-safety-of-blood-tissues-and-organs
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]SaBTO has, from its foundation, taken a continuing interest in prion disease, and has reviewed existing and potential new risk reduction measures.  SaBTO’s summary of such measures is available at:
[normal]https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/current-measures-to-reduce-the-risk-of-vcjd-transmission-by-blood
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]SaBTO has considered potential new prion disease risk reduction measures as they come forward, and has provided advice when appropriate evidence is available.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]SaBTO, and in particular SaBTO’s 
[normal]vCJD Sub G
[normal]roup, has considered and used the latest version of the 
[normal]analytical 
[normal]paper “
[normal]vCJD and transfusion of blood components: An updated risk assessment
[normal]” in its work.  SaBTO is reassured that the latest evidence is used in development of this paper and that the Department remains committed to further revisions as and when significant new evidence becomes available.  SaBTO has noted that the latest edition of the paper, publically available at: 
[normal]https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vcjd-and-transfusion-of-blood-components-updated-risk-assessment
[normal], 
[normal]takes into account the most recent evidence on the prevalence of abnormal prion protein in archived UK appendix tissue.  SaBTO recently used the risk assessment when considering
[normal],
[normal] at the September 2013 meeting
[normal],
[normal] the sourcing of platelets by apheresis; relevant papers and minutes are publically available at:
[normal]https://www.gov.uk/government/policy-advisory-groups/advisory-committee-on-the-safety-of-blood-tissues-and-organs
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]SaBTO recognises that the assumptions used in the risk assessment paper are p
[normal]recautionary in approach, but currently considers this appropriate whilst many scientific uncertainties remain with regard to prions in general and vCJD in particular.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]SaBTO recognises that further risk reduction measures may be proposed in the 
[normal]future including the development and potential use of blood tests for detecting vCJD infection,
[normal] which may help health services take more targeted action.  However in all cases SaBTO would wish to consider the potential implications for introduction of such measures not only for the services themselves but for each donor and recipient.  SaBTO acknowledges the important contribution to such potential future considerations provided by the Department of Health’s 2009 paper 
[normal]Mapping out the consequences of screening blood donations for PrP
[normal]Sc
[normal].  If ever a test were to be considered for introduction
[normal],
[normal] SaBTO would consider 
[normal]amongst other issues 
[normal]the levels of 
[normal]sensitivity and specificity of the test (the highest possible would be 
[normal]necessary 
[normal]with the requirements set by the IVD Directive as a minimum), the availability of 
[normal]a 
[normal]confirmatory assay (no test on donors could be considered without one), and the views of donors and recipients (particularly from heavily transfused individuals 
[normal]including 
[normal]sickle, thalassaemia and myelodysplasia patients).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]SaBTO welcomes the success to date of the strategy, and notes that the NHSBT remains committed to patient 
[normal]welfare
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]SaBTO has a current workstream on Donor Organ Risk Assessment (DORA) aimed at providing evidence based advice on the use of organs available for transplant.  The DORA 
[normal]working group is reviewing
[normal] the evidence base for decision making in organ acceptance and transplantation, looking particularly at specific diagnoses, donor behaviours and characterisations. SaBTO will produce a series of guidance documents and/or position papers, reflecting the best available evidence, to support decision making and identify where any changes in practice would be beneficial.  The aim of the guidance will be to inform clinicians and patients and support shared decision making
[normal],
[normal] and to maximise the successful transplantation of patients and the utilisation of suitable organs.  The first piece of guidance in this programme should be available in 2014 and will cover 
[normal]the use of organs from deceased donors with cancer or a history of cancer.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This is 
[normal]mainly 
[normal]a question for 
[normal]NHSBT (for organ donation across 
[normal]the UK
[normal]), 
[normal]the UK
[normal] blood services
[normal] 
[normal]and others 
[normal](for blood and tissue donation)
[normal].  
[normal]That said, SaBTO's remit includes a consideration of the sufficiency of supply of blood, tissues and organs and this factor is taken into account in all major discussions both at the main SaBTO meetings and within working group sessions
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]One aspect of this is how better to use the Donation after Cardiac Death (DCD) donor.  The use of extracorporeal normothermic perfusion of DCD donations may recover more DCD organs and improve accessibility to organs.  
[normal]A second development would be to 
[normal]review 
[normal]the provision of organ donor screening by NHSBT which 
[normal]may provide opportunities for improved service, 
[normal]particular
[normal]ly with regard to
[normal] more unusual testing for 
[normal]T cruzi
[normal] and malaria. 
[normal] 
[normal]It 
[normal]may 
[normal]also encourage better and more definitive
[normal] “
[normal]confirmatory” testing.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Information from other countries is, often, obtained prior to decision making. 
[normal] 
[normal]For example, when providing
[normal] advice on proposals that affect screening and donation practices SaBTO, where appropriate, considers practices in 
[normal]and evidence from 
[normal]other countries.  
[normal]Instances include when it 
[normal]advised on MSM donor deferrals, provision of 
[normal]cytomegalovirus seronegative
[normal] bl
[normal]ood and West Nile Virus testing
[normal].
[normal]  The upcoming discussions on hepatitis E screening will take account of the wider EU practices
[normal].

[normal]Terms of Reference for the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood,[bold]Tissues and Organs (SaBTO)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Committee will advise Ministers of the UK Government and the Devolved Administrations as well as UK Health Departments on the most appropriate ways to ensure the safety of blood, cells, tissues and organs for transfusion / transplantation. Its remit includes providing advice on the microbiological safety of gametes and stem cells, in liaison with the relevant regulatory authorities. The Committee will provide independent advice on risk management for Ministers and UK Health Departments to consider.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In formulating its advice, the Committee will:
