default&#xa0;
default1.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultYes.  SaBTO has worked with the UK blood services, the UK health departments and the 
defaultr
defaultegulators to ensure that UK policies on who can donate blood and blood products, tissues and organs are evidence-based.
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFor example we provided advice on the donor deferral of men who have had sex with men in relation to blood donation in 2011 and in relation to tissue and cell donation in 2013.  Our advice, which is based on the UK evidence base, has been accepted and implemented in England, Scotland and Wales.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNo.  The UK blood services are required to meet the requirements of the Blood Safety and Quality Regulations 2005, which derive from requirements set by a number of EU Directives.
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSaBTO supports the UK blood services
default’ approach to donor selection
default 
defaultthat
default,
default within the regulatory structure
default,
default ensure
defaults
default that evidence based donor 
defaultdeferral and exclusion 
defaultpolicies are appropriate for the UK donor population.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSaBTO currently provides robust independent scientific evidence based advice to Government on matters within the Committee
default’
defaults remit (attached at A
defaultppendi
defaultx A).  Details of current members and their short biographies are at A
defaultppendi
defaultx B.  Advice from SaBTO is provided to all four UK health departments.
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSaBTO was established in 2008, replacing a previous committee with a narrower remit
default,
default the 
defaultAdvisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Blood, Tissues &amp; Organs for Transplantation (MSBTO).
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSaBTO works closely with other committees where interests are common, including the National Expert Panel on New and Emerging Infections (NEPNEI) and the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP).
default 
defaultIn addition, SaBTO does not only rely on the (considerable) experience of its 
defaultconstituent
default members. 
default 
defaultRather, 
defaultSaBTO’s key working method 
defaultis to establish
default short term working groups 
defaultthat comprise both 
defaultSaBTO members and additional experts
default outside SaBTO. 
default 
defaultThis has been particularly effective in enabling SaBTO to work responsively, effectively, and with a wide evidence base. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSaBTO papers and minutes of meetings are publically available, redacted where appropriate for reasons 
defaultsuch as
default commercial confidentiality, at:

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSaBTO has, from its foundation, taken a continuing interest in prion disease, and has reviewed existing and potential new risk reduction measures.  SaBTO’s summary of such measures is available at:
defaulthttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/current-measures-to-reduce-the-risk-of-vcjd-transmission-by-blood
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSaBTO has considered potential new prion disease risk reduction measures as they come forward, and has provided advice when appropriate evidence is available.
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSaBTO, and in particular SaBTO’s 
defaultvCJD Sub G
defaultroup, has considered and used the latest version of the 
defaultanalytical 
defaultpaper “
defaultvCJD and transfusion of blood components: An updated risk assessment
default” in its work.  SaBTO is reassured that the latest evidence is used in development of this paper and that the Department remains committed to further revisions as and when significant new evidence becomes available.  SaBTO has noted that the latest edition of the paper, publically available at: 
defaulthttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vcjd-and-transfusion-of-blood-components-updated-risk-assessment
default, 
defaulttakes into account the most recent evidence on the prevalence of abnormal prion protein in archived UK appendix tissue.  SaBTO recently used the risk assessment when considering
default,
default at the September 2013 meeting
default,
default the sourcing of platelets by apheresis; relevant papers and minutes are publically available at:
defaulthttps://www.gov.uk/government/policy-advisory-groups/advisory-committee-on-the-safety-of-blood-tissues-and-organs
default&#xa0;
default5.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSaBTO recognises that the assumptions used in the risk assessment paper are p
defaultrecautionary in approach, but currently considers this appropriate whilst many scientific uncertainties remain with regard to prions in general and vCJD in particular.
default&#xa0;
default5.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSaBTO recognises that further risk reduction measures may be proposed in the 
defaultfuture including the development and potential use of blood tests for detecting vCJD infection,
default which may help health services take more targeted action.  However in all cases SaBTO would wish to consider the potential implications for introduction of such measures not only for the services themselves but for each donor and recipient.  SaBTO acknowledges the important contribution to such potential future considerations provided by the Department of Health’s 2009 paper 
defaultMapping out the consequences of screening blood donations for PrP
defaultSc
default.  If ever a test were to be considered for introduction
default,
default SaBTO would consider 
defaultamongst other issues 
defaultthe levels of 
defaultsensitivity and specificity of the test (the highest possible would be 
defaultnecessary 
defaultwith the requirements set by the IVD Directive as a minimum), the availability of 
defaulta 
defaultconfirmatory assay (no test on donors could be considered without one), and the views of donors and recipients (particularly from heavily transfused individuals 
defaultincluding 
defaultsickle, thalassaemia and myelodysplasia patients).
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default6.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSaBTO welcomes the success to date of the strategy, and notes that the NHSBT remains committed to patient 
defaultwelfare
default.
default&#xa0;
default6.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSaBTO has a current workstream on Donor Organ Risk Assessment (DORA) aimed at providing evidence based advice on the use of organs available for transplant.  The DORA 
defaultworking group is reviewing
default the evidence base for decision making in organ acceptance and transplantation, looking particularly at specific diagnoses, donor behaviours and characterisations. SaBTO will produce a series of guidance documents and/or position papers, reflecting the best available evidence, to support decision making and identify where any changes in practice would be beneficial.  The aim of the guidance will be to inform clinicians and patients and support shared decision making
default,
default and to maximise the successful transplantation of patients and the utilisation of suitable organs.  The first piece of guidance in this programme should be available in 2014 and will cover 
defaultthe use of organs from deceased donors with cancer or a history of cancer.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default7.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis is 
defaultmainly 
defaulta question for 
defaultNHSBT (for organ donation across 
defaultthe UK
default), 
defaultthe UK
default blood services
default 
defaultand others 
default(for blood and tissue donation)
default.  
defaultThat said, SaBTO's remit includes a consideration of the sufficiency of supply of blood, tissues and organs and this factor is taken into account in all major discussions both at the main SaBTO meetings and within working group sessions
default.
default&#xa0;
default7.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOne aspect of this is how better to use the Donation after Cardiac Death (DCD) donor.  The use of extracorporeal normothermic perfusion of DCD donations may recover more DCD organs and improve accessibility to organs.  
defaultA second development would be to 
defaultreview 
defaultthe provision of organ donor screening by NHSBT which 
defaultmay provide opportunities for improved service, 
defaultparticular
defaultly with regard to
default more unusual testing for 
defaultT cruzi
default and malaria. 
default 
defaultIt 
defaultmay 
defaultalso encourage better and more definitive
default “
defaultconfirmatory” testing.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default8.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultInformation from other countries is, often, obtained prior to decision making. 
default 
defaultFor example, when providing
default advice on proposals that affect screening and donation practices SaBTO, where appropriate, considers practices in 
defaultand evidence from 
defaultother countries.  
defaultInstances include when it 
defaultadvised on MSM donor deferrals, provision of 
defaultcytomegalovirus seronegative
default bl
defaultood and West Nile Virus testing
default.
default  The upcoming discussions on hepatitis E screening will take account of the wider EU practices
default.

defaultTerms of Reference for the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood,defaultTissues and Organs (SaBTO)default&#xa0;
defaultThe Committee will advise Ministers of the UK Government and the Devolved Administrations as well as UK Health Departments on the most appropriate ways to ensure the safety of blood, cells, tissues and organs for transfusion / transplantation. Its remit includes providing advice on the microbiological safety of gametes and stem cells, in liaison with the relevant regulatory authorities. The Committee will provide independent advice on risk management for Ministers and UK Health Departments to consider.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn formulating its advice, the Committee will:
