"BRC52\nWritten Evidence Submitted by the Joint Industry Board for the Electrical Contracting SummaryThe Joint Industry Board for the Electrical Contracting Industry1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Joint Industry Board for the Electrical Contracting Industry (JIB) \nis a not for profit organisation. It \nwas established in 1968 by The Electrical Contractors’ Association and \nthe Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunication and Plumbing Union (now part of Unite the Union).\n Further information on the JIB is available on its website at \nwww.jib.org.uk\nThe Electrotechnical Certification Scheme2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Electrotechnical Certification Scheme (ECS) is jointly owned by the Joint Industry Board (JIB) and its sister organisation, the Scottish Joint Industry Board (SJIB).\n The primary aims\n of the Scheme \nare\n to set standards for individual competence\n, to ass\ness competence against the standards within the Scheme and to accredit competence through the issue of ECS cards to individuals.\n3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Scheme developed from the JIB and SJIB Grading Systems, which were introduced in 1968 by the JIB and in 1969 by the SJIB.\n4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe UK Register of Electricians was established in 1993 to accredit electricians who could demonstrate competence equivalent to the standards of the National Vocational Qualification (N/SVQ) at Level 3.\n5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn 1999 the JIB Grading System was merged with the UK \nRegister of Electricians to form \none industry recognised scheme under \nthe \nElectrotechnical Certification Scheme (\nECS\n). Th\ne\n scheme became available to all individuals who could demonstrate that they met the \nrequired \nstandard\ns.\n6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe ECS was affiliated to the Construction Skills Certification Scheme (CSCS) in 2002 \nfollowing the introduction of \nHealth and Safety Assessments\n. These were implemented following a call in February 2001 by the Deputy Prime Minister for the construction in\ndustry to improve its safety record.\n7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA total of over 111,000 cards are held across the UK, with\n 98,000\n \ncards currently held by individuals based in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, of which over 48,000 are Installation Electrician\ns. \nA further 13,000 \ncards are held by individuals based in Scotland.\n8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFurther information on the ECS is available on its website at \nwww.ecscard.org.uk\nPart ‘P’ of the Building Regulations9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe introduction of Part ‘P’\n of the Building Reg\nulations\n \nin 2005 set minimum standards for the first time for electrical installation work in dwellings.\n10.\n \nCompetent Person Schemes \ntook the domestic sector forward\n by\n introduc\ning the registration of Qualified Supervisors by\n \ne\nlectrical companies\n. The\n \nQualified Supervisor\n is\n responsible for signing off work and in doing so warranting that the work has been undertaken in accordance with \nall parts \nof the Building Regulations and that the electrical installation has been executed in accordance with \nthe UK \nwiring regulations (\nBS 7671\n)\n. \n11.\n \nThe use of initial and subsequent annual assessments \nof the electrical business \nby \na\n Competent Person Scheme helps to set and maintain standards.\n12.\n \nThe concept of Competent Person Schemes\n,\n which ensure that companies comply wit\nh Building Standards\n,\n is however incomplete without the accreditation of the competence of the individuals who actually undertake the work.\n13.\n \nIt should be noted that whilst the Qualified Supervisor is responsible for \nsigning off work under Part ‘P’, \nthey\n may\n not have personally undertaken the work. This point is particularly important in the case of electrical installations and repairs because much of the work is hidden\n. \n14.\n \nThe JIB offer\ns\n to work with the Competent Person Schemes to accredit the competence of e\nach individual who undertakes electrical installation work in the domestic sector in England and Wales within the scope of Part ‘P’ of the Building Regulations.\n15.\n \nIn each case the individual’s qualifications and experience will be considered in accordance wi\nth the rules of the ECS and an \nappropriate \nECS card will be issued to that individual.\n16.\n \nThe ECS will then become the UK wide scheme for the accreditation of the competence of electricians\n. This will provide c\nonfidence\n for\n consumers and \nclarity for \nthe industry. \n&#xa0;\nThe Benefits of this Proposal17.\n \nThis proposal is intended to deliver the following benefits:\n4 December 2013\n1\n&#xa0;\n"
