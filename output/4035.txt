[[[TRANSFORMING REHABILITATION: EVIDENCE SESSION]]]In advance of the session on 4 December the Committee has been invited to an informal briefing session with senior officials from the Department about the reforms.In this briefing, I have asked officials to focus on the progress that has been made in the Transforming Rehabilitation Programme so far and the work that the Department has been doing with Probation Trusts to prepare them for the transition to the new system. Jeremy and I will then pick up any other questions you have during our evidence session.I know that you have also asked for sight of the Programme's risk register in advance of our evidence session. The process of identifying and managing potential risks to the delivery of any programme is an ongoing process, as is establishing activities which mitigate those risks. Doing so is good practice and in the public interest, and it is my view that the public interest is ultimately best served by doing so in a protected environment. This allows for full and frank evaluation to take place and, for this reason, I am unable to provide you with the risk register at this stage. My officials will obviously be able to talk to you about the high level risks that they are managing and mitigating against, but they will not share detail on the risk register itself with the Committee.&#xa0;
