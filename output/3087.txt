[[[Written evidence from Clean Highways (SRN 041)]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Background]]]In March 2010 Mike Penning MP said in a debate in Westminster Hall on Motorway Litter that “our road networks, in particular our motorways are blighted by rubbish. I am aware that there is legislation in place however … it is frankly not working“. Rather disappointingly none of the Highways Agency’s Business Plans published during his subsequent tenure as minister with responsibility for the motorways contained any reference to this problem.The prime objective of Clean Highways is to find out why the legislation is not working and advise the Government accordingly. I am now working closely with Andrew Gwynne MP. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Statutory Duty]]]The Secretary of State for Transport has a duty under the S89 (1) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (EPA) in respect to the trunk roads and motorways for which he is responsible 

[[[to ensure, so far as is practicable, that they are kept clear of litter and refuse.]]] In doing so he has to have regard to the Litter Code of Practice.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Relevance]]]Any failings in this regard should be taken into account in considering the reforms required to improve the management of the network. Also, efficient travel should include the concept of travel in a clean environment.

[[[ontract mismanagement]]]&#xa0;The contractor could then devise his own programme of inspections and cleansing, and be motivated to execute it in a timely and thorough manner.However this is not what happens.&#xa0;The Agency does not carry out any formal monitoring of the cleanliness of this motorway.&#xa0;&#xa0;Please refer to my e-mail to the Permanent Secretary and the unhelpful reply I received.&#xa0;Further reading&#xa0;October 2013&#xa0;
