[[[Gerges]]], Professor of International Law and Chair in Contemporary Middle East Studies, London School of Economics, gave evidence.              

[[[Q1 Chair:]]] May I welcome members of the public to this session of the Foreign Affairs Committee? We are having a one-off evidence session on developments in Syria. I am pleased to welcome our first witness—apologies if I get the pronunciation wrong—Professor Fawaz Gerges, who is professor of international law and chair in contemporary Middle East studies at the London School of Economics. Professor, welcome. It is very good of you to find time to come and see us.              Turning immediately to the military situation in Syria, would you say that one side or the other has the upper hand militarily?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Gerges]]]

[[[:]]] I would argue that neither side has the capacity or the capability to deliver a decisive blow, even though I would also argue that, at this particular moment, the Syrian regime has a bit of an edge over the opposition. But while the regime is making some major tactical advances—in particular in Homs, Damascus, Qalamoun and even Aleppo, which surprised many of us—I do not think it can win decisively against the opposition.              If we focus on the military situation in terms of the balance of power, what is most alarming to me as an observer of Syria is the marginalisation of the main oppositional force in Syria. Even though the balance of power has not shifted dramatically in the last two years or so, the democratic opposition, represented by the Syrian National Coalition, has not been able to make major inroads inside Syria, and, most importantly, the Free Syrian Army has become more of a skeleton in the last year or so. As you know, it has lost most of its assets—the brigades that were fighting under the umbrella of the Free Syrian Army. Unfortunately for Syria and the Syrian people, it has become more of a banker, providing resources and arms supplies to the various factions, but it is no longer a major fighting force inside Syria.&#xa0;              

[[[Q2 Chair:]]] There is a proliferation of opposition groups at the moment, some armed and some unarmed. Why are they not coalescing to form a solid opposition?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Gerges]]]

[[[:]]] First, as you know, the opposition has been fragmented from the outset, for a variety of reasons. The opposition has been baptised by blood and fire in the last three and a half years. Syria’s is one of the most repressive regimes in the Middle East, and a civil society open space hardly existed. There is a great deal of bickering among the various oppositional factions. Regional powers have also played a highly negative role in supporting certain factions and in pouring fuel on the raging fire among various oppositional factions.&#xa0;              

[[[Q3 Chair:]]] We are coming to regional powers in a minute, but just on the groups that are there on the ground, there is no obvious coalescence at all. Is that because of political objectives or because they have different backers?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Gerges]]]

[[[:]]] In the last few weeks, we have seen the emergence of the so-called Jabhat al-Islamiyyah, the Islamic Front, and this is one of the first major attempts on the part of the armed opposition inside Syria to coalesce. The Islamic Front is made up mainly of relatively moderate Salafi groups that are not affiliated with al-Qaeda-like groups, like al-Nusra and the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham. It is the first attempt on the part of the armed opposition to coalesce. The so-called Islamic Front is an umbrella under which many armed factions have coalesced. The jury is still out on whether the Islamic Front will be able not only to coalesce in terms of an organisational structure, but become an effective fighting machine inside Syria.&#xa0;              

[[[Q4 Mark ]]]

[[[Hendrick]]]

[[[:]]] Coming on to the regional powers, could you give us an assessment of the extent to which the Governments of Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia are assisting the anti-Assad forces in Syria?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Gerges]]]

[[[:]]] My take on the Syrian conflict, and I could be wrong, is that, looking at the big picture, the internal Syrian element is one of the least important now, even though this started as a political uprising—a revolution—against the Assad regime. The conflict has mutated—in fact, what we are witnessing in Syria is a fierce geo-strategic struggle between, on the one hand Saudi Arabia and its allies, and on the other hand Iran. This fierce geo-strategic struggle has major sectarian connotations. So, unfortunately for the Syrian people, Syria in many ways has become more of a battlefield for regional powers. You have Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey and to a lesser extent the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait. On the other hand you have Iran and Iraq. Iraq is the most fascinating element in this equation, because, I would argue, that Iraq is a very important player in providing critical assets and support for the Assad regime, not to mention Hezbollah.              These are really the big five powers and my take on it is that without an agreement among the regional powers, in particular between Saudi Arabia and Iran, the various Syrian groups, including the Syrian regime, would not be able to reach an agreement. That is why, at the end of the day, hardly anything would take place in Geneva II unless there is a kind of implicit agreement between Saudi Arabia and Iran.&#xa0;

[[[              ]]]

[[[Q5 Mark ]]]

[[[Hendrick]]]

[[[:]]] The question was, though, about the extent to which those Governments are assisting. I will come on to Iran later, but are you saying that the Turks, Qataris and Saudis, through their Governments, are heavily supporting the anti-Assad forces?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Gerges]]]

[[[:]]] I take it for granted that Saudi Arabia is now the spearhead, supporting the so-called Islamic Front. My understanding is that the Islamic Front is basically a Saudi-supported armed coalition and Saudi Arabia—in particular the Saudi intelligence services—are in charge of the Syrian portfolio now. Saudi Arabia has taken over from Qatar in the last eight months or so. So even though initially Qatar and Turkey were the major supporters of both the political and the armed opposition, Saudi Arabia is now the spearhead and it is trying to find a kind of alternative to the al-Nusra Front and the Islamic State in Iraq, because they are terrified that the jihadi Salafi groups are gaining the upper hand in some areas inside Syria.&#xa0;

[[[              ]]]

[[[Q6 Mark ]]]

[[[Hendrick]]]

[[[:]]] How much non-governmental support do you think is coming from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey as well?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Gerges]]]

[[[:]]] You put your finger on the pulse of the really critical question why jihadi Salafi elements have gained the upper hand. We not only have to talk about governmental support for the various armed factions, we know a great deal of resources—private resources—are flowing from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Turkey, Lebanon and other places to some of the extremist elements that have really gained momentum. Based on everything I know in terms of open sources, I do not believe that Turkey, Qatar or Saudi Arabia are funding the extremist factions inside Syria; but we know, based on multiple sources, that private individuals and businessmen are providing the assets that have enabled the jihadi Salafi elements to really gain the upper hand in some parts of Syria.&#xa0;

[[[              ]]]

[[[Q7 Mark ]]]

[[[Hendrick]]]

[[[:]]] What sort of strength of forces are the Iranians providing, and how much co-ordination do you think there is with Hezbollah coming from Lebanon?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Gerges]]]

[[[:]]] I would argue that without Iran’s logistical, political and financial support, the Assad regime would not have survived as long as it has. Again, we miss the big picture by looking at how many Revolutionary Guards are inside Syria; this is not about numbers. What is really most surprising about the Syrian Army is that it has not only remained an intact fighting force in the last two or three years, but it has become a deadlier fighting force in the last two and a half years. The question is why the Syrian Army has survived as long as it has and why it has adjusted and adapted to urban warfare. It is because of the retraining and restructuring that the Syrian Army has undergone by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. Based on everything that we know, there has been a restructuring of the Syrian Army. If you look at the last three years or so, the army now has more capacity to go on the offensive; its fighting capabilities have increased a great deal and improved a great deal. I would argue this is in a considerable sense due to the restructuring that it has undergone by the Revolutionary Guards.              Secondly, when Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, said that he made a strategic decision to intervene in Syria, I had no doubt in my mind that military conditions on the ground inside Syria were going to change. The question is not whether Hezbollah has sent 4,000 or 10,000 fighters. These are very skilled, determined and ideologically committed fighters. If you look at the battles in Homs, in Damascus and in other parts, you see that, basically, Hezbollah as a spearhead, as a vanguard force, has been able to allow the Syrian regime to achieve a certain breakthrough in the field. So yes, Iran and Hezbollah have made a critical difference on the battlefields inside Syria in the last year or so.&#xa0;

[[[              ]]]

[[[Q8]]] 

[[[Andrew ]]]

[[[Rosindell]]]

[[[:]]] One of the greatest concerns for people in this country is UK citizens going over to Syria to take part in the conflict, who potentially become radicalised and then perhaps return to the UK. What do you think drives them to do this? What response should the authorities here have to this problem?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Gerges]]]

[[[:]]] You are asking a big question and we have to speculate a great deal. Whenever we talk about foreign fighters, we look to the Afghanistan theatre, the Afghanistan-Pakistan experience. We measure everything in terms of what happened in Afghanistan in the 1980s and how the Afghan war radicalised and militarised foreign fighters, some of whom returned home to Britain or Spain or other countries. We are talking about small numbers. The numbers that we have seen are, give or take—no-one knows the number—about 1,000 fighters from Western countries.&#xa0;

[[[              ]]]

[[[Q9 Andrew ]]]

[[[Rosindell]]]

[[[:]]] In Syria?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Gerges]]]

[[[:]]] In Syria.&#xa0;

[[[              ]]]

[[[Q10]]] 

[[[Andrew ]]]

[[[Rosindell]]]

[[[:]]] The police say that around 200 British citizens have travelled to Syria for this purpose.              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Gerges]]]

[[[:]]] I said out of the 7,000 or 8,000 foreign fighters that we think exist in Syria, there are about 1,000 fighters from Europe and the United States, two hundred of which probably are British.              My take on it is that most of the fighters who have gone to Syria to fight were inspired and motivated by the massacres that have been taking place inside Syria. I do not think they were following Osama bin Laden’s or Ayman al-Zawahiri’s call to go to Syria. They were basically inspired by the massacre of the children and the mutilations—the crimes committed by the Assad regime—in the same way that many fighters were motivated by the call to help their Afghani counterparts, co-religionists, in Afghanistan.              The problem is that you never know what is going to happen on a battlefield in terms of militarisation and radicalisation. My take on it is that, in the same way that many of us feared that the thousands of fighters in Iraq would come back to haunt European and Western societies and that did not materialise, my hope is that this will not really materialise in the case of Syria either. I do not think it will, but do not take my word for it. If I were a person responsible for security in Britain and France, I would worry a great deal about what 200 or even 100 fighters returning home would do.&#xa0;

[[[              ]]]

[[[Q11 Sir Menzies Campbell: ]]]I am going to ask you to speculate again, Professor, but I am quite certain that the speculation will be thoroughly informed. What do you think of the various explanations that have been offered for the use of chemical weapons on 21 August? What prompted that? Some people have suggested it was the act of a rogue commander in the middle echelon of command, others that there was a more sinister purpose. What is your take on that?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Gerges]]]

[[[:]]] I did a piece in the morning in The Guardian, in which I said I was surprised that the regime used chemical weapons at that particular moment, because it was gaining the upper hand. The opposition were very encircled and besieged, and also the UN team arrived. It was mind-boggling. I think the Americans say, and I take their word for it in this particular sense, that a commander wanted to clear the area, because there was a major offensive in Ghouta. Ghouta is an eastern suburb of Damascus. The idea behind it is that operational commanders on the ground wanted to cleanse the area. According to American intelligence—you know all this stuff—they heard certain conversations in which a politician or official reprimanded one of the commanders for using chemical weapons on such a large scale. They were hoping that such use would not be detected by the international community. Again, I am citing American intelligence that officials at the highest levels knew of the chemical weapons. As you know, that was not the first time.&#xa0;              

[[[Q12 Sir Menzies Campbell:]]] But it was on a wholesale basis?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Gerges]]]

[[[:]]] Yes, because, what you need to understand is that Ghouta suburb is one of the most important theatres for the Assad regime. This is the gateway not only to the international airport, but to Damascus. The battle for Damascus is life and death for the Assad regime. This is not a tactical battle. Some elements of the regime have made it very clear that they would bring down the temple on the heads of everyone if Damascus appeared to fall. This sounded a very rational explanation on the part of the commander; “This is the battle; am I going to use a limited quantity of imported chemical weapons to make the breakthrough in the Ghouta suburb?&#xa0;              

[[[Q13 Sir Menzies Campbell:]]] How far, if indeed to any extent, did that prompt Assad to accept the proposals for disarmament of chemical weapons, and how would you assess the role of Russia in that process?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Gerges]]]

[[[:]]] You know more than I do on this. Whatever Russia wants, Russia will most likely get. It is as simple as that. I talked about Iran; Russia is more important than Iran in providing military hardware, diplomatic support and recognition for the Assad regime. The Russians made it very clear: there is no wiggle room here. The Foreign Minister and the President—Russians at the highest levels—wanted Assad to give up his chemical weapons, and Assad has decided to do that.              The big question I would ask myself if I were Assad is: would I give up all my chemical weapons? No, I would not, because I would think, “This is a prolonged war,” and I would try to maintain a certain amount. You are talking about 1,000 tonnes of chemical weapons—who knows whether it is 1,100 tonnes of chemical weapons? Yes, on the whole, Syria most likely would be disarmed of most of its chemical weapons. I myself would not give up all the chemical weapons, if I were sitting in Damascus today.&#xa0;              

[[[Q14 Sir Menzies Campbell:]]] That is an interesting piece of evidence, because the Committee recently heard from another source the belief that Assad might have kept up to 25%.              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Gerges]]]

[[[:]]] I am speculating. I am saying that is a theoretical point of view.&#xa0;              

[[[Q15 Sir Menzies Campbell:]]] Let me put it this way: if that information were correct, would you be surprised by it?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Gerges]]]

[[[:]]] Yes, I would be surprised by 25% because, first, they would realise that the American and European powers probably would know this. They also would realise that Russia would be very upset about its credibility, and Russia also wants to exercise influence. The fact is that the Russians are saying, “We will deliver Syria. Would you deliver the opposition?”. This is very important. Again, I am speculating, but I would not say 25%. I would say 5% or 10%.&#xa0;              

[[[Q16 Sir Menzies Campbell:]]] But you would not be surprised by a percentage?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Gerges]]]

[[[:]]] Not at all.&#xa0;              

[[[Q17 Sir Menzies Campbell:]]] Let us move on to something else that also involves the Russians, although perhaps not in the direct way you have described. Who do you think needs to participate in Geneva II for it to be credible? A related issue that I am sure you will understand is that the British Government have so far declined to accept the view that Iran should participate. First, who do you think should participate? Secondly, are the British Government right to hold to their position that unless Iran signs up to Geneva I, it is not entitled to sit at the table for Geneva II?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Gerges]]]

[[[:]]] I think Lakhdar Brahimi is correct to insist that all the powers that exercise considerable influence in Syria should participate in Geneva II. If our reading is correct and Iran is a pivotal player in maintaining the Assad regime, then Iran would probably play a critical part in making Geneva II a success. My take is that everyone would say that Iran is not only a pivotal player, but maintains and has sustained the Assad regime.              Despite reservations about Iranian conduct in other theatres, I think there is a new leadership within Iran. President Hassan Rouhani and his Foreign Minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, have made it very clear that Iran would like to play a positive role. My take on it is that if we are genuine and serious about making Geneva II a success, you cannot go round the questions of Iran and Saudi Arabia. It is not only Britain saying this; the United States and France say that Iran should accept Geneva. As you all know, one of the major obstacles to Iran’s participation in Geneva II is Saudi Arabia, which has put a veto on this.&#xa0;              

[[[Q18]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[Sir Menzies Campbell:]]] It is not just the success of the conference that matters, but the success of any outcome determined by the conference.              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Gerges]]]

[[[:]]] Absolutely.&#xa0;

[[[              ]]]

[[[Q19 Sir Menzies Campbell:]]] In that sense, do you think that there is any merit in the notion that if Iran is allowed to participate, it would be bound into the process and have an interest in a successful outcome?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Gerges]]]

[[[:]]] I think the Iranians are not ideologically wedded to Assad himself, in the same way that the Russians are not really wedded to Assad. This is a marriage of convenience—John Kerry’s words, not mine. Would the Iranians bargain? Absolutely. They invented modern diplomacy; it was not invented in Westphalia. It came from bazaari diplomacy. The Iranians would bargain. We need to understand that this is a fierce regional struggle. It is not only about what Britain, France and the United States want. You are talking about a fierce regional geo-strategic struggle taking place between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Without an agreement among the regional powers, I very much doubt whether Geneva II would even take place, let alone have any kind of fruitful result.              You cannot dance around the question of Iran if we are serious about producing a positive outcome. Iran is pivotal in the same way that Saudi Arabia is pivotal. In the same way that Iran exercises considerable influence over the Assad regime, Saudi Arabia also now exercises considerable influence over the opposition. Ahmad Jarba, the President of the Syrian national coalition, would not go to Geneva unless Saudi Arabia gave him the go-ahead. That is how bad it is. This tells you that the internal variable in the Syrian conflict is now one of the least important variables. The regional variable has now exceeded the internal variable in importance.&#xa0;              

[[[Q20 Mike Gapes:]]] Can I ask you about the failure of the international community to act two and a half years ago? Has that made the situation in Syria much worse? Linked to that, what would have been the effects of a decision to have military strikes against the Assad regime, which were under consideration at the end of August?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Gerges]]]

[[[:]]] To give you my take, once British, American and French fighter jets drop bombs on Syria, the whole calculus of the conflict changes. Again, we all know history, and the history of the region. That is my reading of the situation. It would have played into the hands of the Assad regime: “This is again another colonial war—another Iraq. The West is intervening.” It would have turned Assad into an Arab hero. In fact, many of the people who basically are sceptical about Assad would say, “Look, the West is back at it again.”

[[[              ]]]

[[[Q21 Mike Gapes:]]] Would that have been the same if there had been a decision two and half years ago to impose a no-fly zone at that point, before the radicalisation of rebels?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Gerges]]]

[[[:]]] You are asking a very counter-factual question. It would not have been the same, I agree with you. There are two questions I want to address, although I know our time is limited. First, there was a major strategic blunder on the part of the western powers, particularly when the American President said that Assad must go; Assad’s days were numbered and he must go. Yet that particular strategic statement was not backed by any kind.              Of course, the British followed by repeating the same; and the French and what have you. I do not think that President Barack Obama had given any strategic or major calculation. In fact, we know now that US intelligence services had a different assessment of Assad’s days; that his ship was not sinking, contrary to what the American President said. In that particular sense, there was a calculation; a combination of economic warfare, psychological warfare, regional pressure with Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia supporting the opposition. All those elements would have basically brought about a tipping point that Assad would be forced to.              The big question is why the West gets it wrong. There are a variety of reasons. First, we underestimated Assad’s ability to fight to the bitter end. We underestimated the social base of support that Assad had—whether it is 30%. In particular, we underestimated the capacity of the Syrian Army to fight and remain an intact force. We underestimated the capacity of regional allies to support Assad. The most important thing we underestimated was the pivotal support that Russia provided, too. All those basic factors have allowed Assad to survive.              I do not think there was any major strategic calculation on the part of Britain. To me, the biggest, very alarming and sad development is what has happened to the opposition; what has happened to the Syrian National Coalition—we come back to the start of my talk—and what has happened to the Free Syrian Army. [Interruption.] &#xa0;              

[[[Chair:]]] We have to go and vote, I’m afraid. Are you able to wait until we come back?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Gerges]]]

[[[:]]] Of course.

[[[              ]]]

[[[Chair:]]] I apologise to witnesses. It is the price of democracy, I’m afraid. If it is just one vote, I would be grateful if colleagues could be back in 12 minutes.&#xa0;              Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.              On resuming—&#xa0;              

[[[Q23 Mike Gapes:]]] Professor Gerges, you referred to the Syrian opposition. May I ask you about the interesting developments among the Kurdish opposition in Syria? I recently went to the Domiz refugee camp in Iraqi Kurdistan. There are 75,000 Syrian Kurd refugees in the camp, and there are, I am told, a total of some 200,000 or 250,000 Kurdish refugees in the Iraqi Kurdistan region. My instinct is that those people will not be going back for a considerable time, because they are well looked after and many of the men are able to work and are supported by the Kurdish regional Government. It is clear from the conversations I had there that many of the Kurds in Iraq are anti-Assad, yet the main fighting group among the Kurdish-Syrian population, the PYD, seem now to be working in league with Assad against some of the al-Qaeda-linked elements. What are the long-term implications of that and the fact that the Kurdish region of Syria now seems effectively to be under the control of the PYD?

[[[              ]]]

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Gerges]]]

[[[:]]] Yes, as you said, there are major divisions among the Syrian Kurds. The PYD does not speak for all the Kurdish political elements. Yes, the PYD is implicitly working indirectly with the Assad regime and is seizing the opportunity because it realises that this is a historic moment to have autonomy, as opposed to a state within a state. The PYD has been successful in clearing most of the Kurdish areas of the al-Qaeda and al-Nusra fronts. The PYD has had some major battles with the Free Syrian Army, too.              The long-term implications are extremely alarming because, as you will know, the areas in which the Kurdish communities exist are not really pure Kurdish. You have Arabs and Christians, which tells you that, ultimately, there will be ethnic cleansing, particularly if the PYD decides to pursue the strategy of having an autonomous Kurdish area. I do not think the Syrian opposition, whether you are talking about the Salafi elements or the Free Syrian Army, would allow the Kurdish areas to establish an autonomous zone within Syria itself. That is not to mention the question of Turkey. Turkey, as you know, is very much opposed to any kind of autonomous Kurdish area on its border.              So there are major implications, but that tells you a great deal about how the Syrian conflict has mutated over the past almost three years. It started as a political uprising and mutated into an armed internal struggle. Now you are talking about multiple conflicts collapsing into one. Various communities, particularly the Kurds, are trying to seize this moment to establish an autonomous zone inside Syria.&#xa0;              

[[[Q24 Mike Gapes:]]] You mentioned the attitude of the Turkish Government. Does the autonomous area controlled by the PYD assist or undermine the rapprochement between the Turkish Government and the PKK within Turkey?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Gerges]]]

[[[:]]] I do not think it has any major implications, because, obviously, the Erdogan Government has made a strategic decision for rapprochement with its own Kurdish community and with Kurdistan. What we have seen in the past few weeks has been historic in many ways.              I think the Erdogan Government has also recognised the long-term security implications of what is happening inside Syria. If you really observe clearly, the Turkish Government are moving more and more towards believing in a political solution. They are no longer the spearhead of all-out war against Assad. They realise that their security is deeply and directly affected, and not just by the Kurdish element—remember that al-Qaeda elements are basically on the Turkish-Syrian border—and that affects the short and long-term security interests of Turkey.&#xa0;              

[[[Q25 Sandra Osborne:]]] Who is supplying arms and by which routes are they going? To what extent is each of Syria’s neighbours facilitating or permitting supply of arms to Syria, to either the opposition or the Government?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Gerges]]]

[[[:]]] Turkey has always been the major outlet for arms and matériel for the opposition. After the militarisation of the Syrian uprising, Turkey made a strategic decision to open its front, including free for all. When the western powers argue, “Why would you allow certain extremist elements to use you?” Turkey says, “Look, we have open borders. We have made a decision to support the opposition. And how do we tell?” Any person can go to Turkey—you do not need a visa now, so you have the 1,000 European or western individuals who mainly use Turkey as the major outlet. I do not think that Turkey has consciously either supported or allowed jihadist elements to enter Syria, but Turkey has had an open policy, even though in the last few months the Turkish intelligence services have become much more conscious and are targeting some of the extremist elements who are entering Turkey.              The new development in the Saudi policy—I am talking about open sources again; I do not have any intelligence—is that Jordan has become a major second front for certain Free Syrian Army assets trained in Jordan by American, British and other forces These are very specific groups. They are using Daraa in particular as the major front to target the soft belly of the Assad regime. Saudi intelligence services in particular are in charge of the Daraa front. Jordan is very important, but it is a more targeted and focused front, trying to achieve an operational breakthrough by attacking Daraa, because from Daraa you go to Damascus, the Qalamoun and so on.              So far the Assad regime is terrified about this particular front. In fact, once the major battles in Qalamoun, which is on the Lebanese-Syrian front, are over, which will most likely be in the next few weeks because the Syrian Government are investing considerable resources, you will see this as the new front. Assad will fight to show the Saudis that they cannot make a breakthrough in Daraa, because that is a very important front. So we have Turkey and Jordan and initially Lebanon. The Assad regime and Hezbollah have tightened the Lebanese-Syrian borders area, so few resources are flowing from Lebanon to Syria. Jordan and Turkey are the major fronts by which the opposition is gaining arms.              The Syrian Government is being provided with major strategic assets by Russia—we know that. There is also Iran, and the biggest story in this conflict is how Iraq has emerged as a critical player. The Tehran-Baghdad-Damascus road is really the lifeline of the Assad regime for a variety of reasons. Remember, the Assad Government requires tremendous resources in terms of ammunition, weapons, petroleum, food and what have you. That is not just in terms of Iranians; you also have fighters. We do not know the number of fighters, but they are flowing from Iraq into Syria as well to help some of the regime elements, particularly in Damascus.              

[[[Chair:]]] We are running very tight on time, Professor Gerges, so I would be grateful if you could keep your answers brief. Thank you.&#xa0;              

[[[Q26 Sandra Osborne:]]] What evidence is there that instability in Syria is generating significant new support for extremism and internal opposition in neighbouring countries?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Gerges]]]

[[[:]]] That is a very important question. Lebanon is in the eye of the storm. The reverberations of the Syrian crisis are being felt on Arab streets. Lebanon really is teetering on the brink of collapse. Certain areas of Lebanon are also split along sectarian lines. Certain extremist elements have established a major base in Lebanon—they had been there before the Syrian crisis, but the crisis has aggravated the situation in Lebanon. The Salafi jihadi current has a stronger footing in Lebanon.              In Iraq, it is a two-way street. Remember what is happening in Iraq: on average, 1,000 Iraqis are being killed each month. It was al-Qaeda in Iraq that established the al-Nusra Front in Syria. Now, the various elements in Syria are also playing a major role in intensifying the insurgency in Iraq itself, so you have a two-way street between Iraq and Syria. Jordan is terrified. It is terrified of the political instability, particularly because of the flow of Salafi jihadi elements in Syria. We estimate that there are between 1,000 and 2,000 Salafi jihadi Jordanians fighting in Syria; a few hundred have been killed.              To come back to Turkey, it is also concerned about the short and long-term security implications of the Syrian conflict. When the Americans and the British say, “We are concerned about the spillover effects of the Syrian conflicts into the neighbourhood,” this is a Syrian concern. Go to Lebanon, go to Tripoli, go to the Bekaa Valley, go to Baghdad—you hear the same story. The biggest story now is what you do with more than 10,000 extremist fighters who are fighting inside Syria, some of whom might return to Iraq, Lebanon and neighbouring countries to battle existing authorities there.&#xa0;              

[[[Q27 Sandra Osborne:]]] So if there was a civil war in Lebanon, for example, what could the UK and the western powers do try to prevent that or to assist?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Gerges]]]

[[[:]]] Lebanon has its own problems, as you know. There are multiple challenges. The basic divide is between the al-Hariri camp and the Hezbollah camp; you also have a sectarian divide—that particular divide has taken on sectarian connotations. The Syrian conflict has also exacerbated the Lebanese conflict. The most important point to impress on Lebanese of all political persuasions is the need to establish a Government. You know that there is no functioning Government in Lebanon, and the presidential election most likely will not take place, so ultimately you have a deadlock. It would take a spark—a major black swan—in Lebanon for the country basically to implode. It is a major situation. When we talk about Syria, we not just talking about security inside Syria; we are talking about geostrategic security. The neighbourhood is as affected as Syria itself.&#xa0;              

[[[Q28 Mark ]]]

[[[Hendrick]]]

[[[:]]] Can we view what is going on in Syria in terms of a Sunni-Shi’a conflict? Obviously the borders were drawn up many years ago, mainly as a result of colonialism, and they probably bear very little resemblance to genuine communities. Will Syria still exist after this?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Gerges]]]

[[[:]]] The Syrian conflict did not start as a sectarian conflict. The sectarian divide in Syria is a product of the war itself. It is a recent development. I think that we miss the big picture by saying that it is a sectarian divide. What has now happened is that the geostrategic rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran has taken on sectarian connotations. You have sectarian mobilisation. You have major material and ideological resources invested in trying to mobilise both camps. The reality is that the sectarian divide masks geostrategic interests. The geostrategic struggle is what matters—that is the independent variable. The sectarian divide is basically used as an asset by the geostrategic powers in order to mobilise their own communities.              So what does Hezbollah say? “We intervened not only to save the Assad regime, but to save the shrine of Zainab, one of the most sacred Shi’a shrines in Syria.” Many Shi’a Iraqis are coming to Syria and mobilising on the fact that the Shi’a community and shrines are being threatened. What does Saudi Arabia and its allies say? “The Shi’as are coming. The Shi’as are infiltrating the heartland of the Sunni Arab world.” But the reality, as we know, is that this is a geostrategic struggle. At the end of the day, I deeply believe—I could be wrong—that the Syrian people will be able to overcome this sectarian divide if a regional agreement is found between, in particular, Saudi Arabia and Iraq.&#xa0;              

[[[Chair:]]] Professor Gerges, I am sorry you were interrupted so much, but thank you for your time.&#xa0;

[[[Examination of Witness]]]Witness: Shashank Joshi, Research Fellow, Royal United Services Institute, gave evidence.              

[[[Chair:]]] Our second witness today needs no introduction as far as this Committee is concerned. Shashank Joshi, research fellow at RUSI, thank you for coming. It is good to see you again.              

[[[Shashank Joshi:]]] Good afternoon.&#xa0;              

[[[Q29 Chair:]]] Is there any reason why the opposition is not coalescing together into a coherent opposition? It seems to be fragmented. What is your assessment of this?              

[[[Shashank Joshi:]]] I do not see why its natural tendency should be to coalesce in the first place. First, there are ideological differences involved. You have the jihadis at one end of the spectrum; you have what Professor Gerges called moderate Salafis, although some may disagree that they are moderate, groups that have coalesced into the Islamic Front, which is itself a coalition of three previous umbrella groups plus others; and then you have the FSA with its Supreme Military Council, which itself has some brigades and battalions that have overlapping membership with the Islamic Front. There is no natural reason why these ideologically differently inclined groups should coalesce in the first place.              On top of that, you have geographic differences—these groups are active in different places. So even within the Islamic Front, some of these groups have turf to defend; they can extract rent and they can smuggle in particular areas. And you have external sources of support. You have Saudi Arabia supporting not only the Islamic Front, as Professor Gerges rightly identified, but specific groups within that, so they have an incentive to maintain that support and avoid sharing the spoils of those outside resources with others.              In a way, I am not sure why they should coalesce. Their objectives are different. Their threshold for what constitutes victory is different. We have already seen six out of seven groups in this Islamic Front, which is one of the most significant bodies in Syria now, say that any attendance at the Geneva II talks by the moderate opposition would be considered completely unacceptable and would invite retaliation, so they have different objectives as well. Does that go some way to addressing that point?&#xa0;              

[[[Q30 Chair:]]] Yes, that is a good answer. We have received reports that the Islamic Front has overrun General Idris’s camp. Have you heard anything about that?              

[[[Shashank Joshi:]]] General Idris himself is formally based in Turkey.              

[[[Chair:]]] I thought it was just on the Syrian side.              

[[[Shashank Joshi:]]] I have not seen that report.

[[[              ]]]

[[[Chair:]]] There is a report: Islamic Front fighters take over Free Syrian Army bases near Turkish border.              

[[[Shashank Joshi:]]] It is entirely possible. General Idris has ostensibly welcomed the Islamic Front, but he has little choice. He has haemorrhaged fighters and brigades to this.              What is interesting is that there is a gentle tug of war now. Those who were supporting the Islamic Front say. “This is our only hope for pulling fighters away from the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham.” Some have said that they can work tactically with Jabhat al-Nusra and pull it away from ISIS, because those two al-Qaeda groups themselves have their own differences. I think the Free Syrian Army’s calculation was that if they were fated to have this front and lose members to it, at least it would weaken the jihadis themselves. Ultimately—this is a bit of speculation—it will consume them.&#xa0;              

[[[Q31 Rory Stewart:]]] Professor Gerges emphasised strongly that we had underestimated the strength of Assad. He said that the British and American Governments had called on Assad to step down and he specified that we had underestimated the support in the Syrian population for Assad, the capacity of the Syrian Army, the importance of Iran and the role of Russia. Why did we make this mistake?              

[[[Shashank Joshi:]]] First, comparisons may have been made with Libya, which was fresh in the memory at the time of the early stages of the Syria conflict. One of the major differences is that Libya’s army peeled away, or fractured in half, very early on. The entire eastern half basically melted away, whereas Syria’s armed forces and particularly its special forces—&#xa0;              

[[[Q32 Rory Stewart:]]] Sorry, because we are so short of time, I am specifically asking how did the Foreign Office and the State Department get it wrong? There will be many answers, but what within the institutional structures, procedures and consultation mechanisms led them not to spot the things you point out in relation to Libya?              

[[[Shashank Joshi:]]] I don’t know. If I had to point to one thing, it would be underestimating the degree to which the opposition would fragment.

[[[              ]]]

[[[Rory Stewart:]]] So in your view and in your experience of the foreign policy system—consultations, the relationship between think-tanks and Government, the way in which policy is made—what is leading us to come to the wrong conclusions? We can all list what they got wrong, but how did they get it wrong?              

[[[Shashank Joshi:]]] In the Syrian case, one important factor may have been lack of access to information on what is happening on the ground. It was not easy to access what was going on. The embassies were evacuated early on, because these were very dangerous and opaque areas to operate in, so most of the information we were getting early on was from the Turkish side—people in southern Turkey, including, in terms of intelligence, the CIA, which was operating in southern Turkey, speaking to members of the FSA. Perhaps they did not have access to the granular detail of what was going on further inside Syria. I am speculating.&#xa0;

[[[              ]]]

[[[Q33 Rory Stewart:]]] So what reforms could we introduce to ensure that in future, with situations as important as this, we are able to get a more reliable assessment?              

[[[Shashank Joshi:]]] If the problem is a lack of presence, one of the solutions is to remain inside the country as long as possible, but is that a reform? I am not sure. There were concrete security reasons why the UK, the US and others could not stay in Damascus. You can argue that there should have been more pressure on countries like Turkey early on in the conflict to provide more information and monitor the opposition on their soil, but it is difficult to say what might have occurred.&#xa0;              

[[[Q34 Rory Stewart:]]] Essentially, what you are describing is a situation in which the confirmation bias was that Assad was weak. So presumably what was required were voices from inside Syria who were able to put the other side of the story. There needed to be a way for you, or foreign ministries, or journalists, to question the information they received. They were, as you say, essentially receiving information from the Free Syrian Army, which had an interest in saying that the Assad regime was weak and was going to collapse in an instant. It is not simply about keeping diplomatic staff on the ground, it is about finding ways for systems such as the Foreign Office and State Department to listen to the other side of the story and question their conventional wisdom.

[[[              ]]]

[[[Shashank Joshi:]]] Yes, I agree, but it is also a question of military analysis: simply understanding how much strength the military had, which is not just about listening to the other side. It wasn’t just to do with social support. There were plenty of people saying, “Assad has the support of his people,” and in many cases saying so on fairly spurious grounds. People were saying that 50% of the population supported Assad. Part of the issue was that we just got the military analysis wrong and that was pure lack of information. I am not sure that it was just about structures, it was about the information available to us as well.&#xa0;              

[[[Q35 Rory Stewart:]]] So do you think that the fundamental problem was not, as Professor Gerges said, that we underestimated the credibility of Assad, the support in the population and the support from Iran and Russia, which are political issues; you put 90% of the emphasis on the capacity of the Syrian Army?              

[[[Shashank Joshi:]]] Well, no. Professor Gerges is right to point to Iran as well in sheer financial support, military support and Hezbollah’s involvement. We also underestimated that. The reason may have simply been misunderstanding their stakes in the conflict.&#xa0;              

[[[Q36 Rory Stewart:]]] What is your assessment of President Obama’s handling of the Syrian crisis?              

[[[Shashank Joshi:]]] I think his ambivalence early on was very damaging. He sent a lot of people into southern Turkey promising rebels things he would never deliver on, and the sense of embitterment had a very negative impact on how the rebellion proceeded. But after that point, once he made the decision he was not going to support the rebels, he has not handled it terribly badly. I think his decision to show flexibility and to adopt the disarmament plan with Russia was, by and large, a sensible one. Otherwise, I think he was correct not to get pulled into the conflict very early on, purely on the whims of Gulf allies; I do not think that was necessarily the wrong decision.&#xa0;              

[[[Q37 Rory Stewart:]]] What do you think will be the implications of Obama’s policy for the US’s long-term presence in the Middle East? What has it meant for American credibility? What will it mean for the next 10 years of US relations in the Middle East?              

[[[Shashank Joshi:]]] It is only one part of his Middle East policy. It will probably mean there is a long-term jihadist threat emanating from the Syrian area across all the US allies in the region, particularly Jordan, southern Turkey and Iraq, but that is only a narrow part of his Middle East policy. He has had very strong successes in Iran; I do not think his position with the Gulf monarchies is as dire as is made out; and he has at least restarted the Israel-Palestine talks. All those things will sit alongside the failure of the US to resolve the conflict in Syria.&#xa0;

[[[              ]]]

[[[Q38 Mark ]]]

[[[Hendrick]]]

[[[:]]] How do you think neighbouring countries—Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and, of course, Iran—are influencing the dynamics of what is happening inside Syria? If you could pull out your crystal ball, how might that play out in the medium to long term?              

[[[Shashank Joshi:]]] Taking the neighbouring countries in turn, Israel’s role is pretty minimal. It is engaging in sporadic strikes against Syrian targets where it sees a transfer of advanced weaponry, but otherwise, by and large, it supports the stalemate, which it sees as weakening multiple foes.              Jordan was initially ambivalent, but once it had US forces stationed on its soil, it was eager to see much more done to minimise the growth of jihadist factions. It even suggested the use of American drone strikes from its territory.              We talked about finance coming from the Gulf for some of the extremist actors. I think Turkey is still allowing some of that to occur in its border areas, because it ultimately sees groups such as the Islamic Front as a useful buffer against not just ISIS, but Kurds. Although it is more open to Geneva II than it was a year ago, when it was pleading for all-out military intervention, I think it still sees support for groups like the Islamic Front as its primary means of influence in Syria.              Iraq, I think, is preoccupied by its own escalating levels of violence. It still allows Iranian overflights of arms into Syria. It is still allowing many Shi’a volunteers from Iraqi groups to fight inside Syria. It still sees a victory by the opposition as tantamount to a victory by fundamentalist Sunni forces that would catalyse much greater violence and political upheaval in Iraq, but I think it is not an active player in the same way that Turkey and Saudi Arabia are.&#xa0;              

[[[Q39 Mark ]]]

[[[Hendrick]]]

[[[:]]] On the question of jihadis, a lot of people are travelling to Syria, and they are getting all sorts of experience and training. As we saw when we did our inquiry into North and West Africa, the downfall of the Libyan regime saw a lot of jihadis move south. We saw what happened in Mali, where many of the people involved came from Libya. Do you see similar movements of people happening when the situation in Syria stabilises to some degree? Do you see people moving out and looking to destabilise other parts of the region?              

[[[Shashank Joshi:]]] Yes, and I think this is where I would differ slightly from Professor Gerges, who said the numbers of European Muslim fighters and foreign fighters is fairly small. This is the largest European Muslim foreign fighting contingent in modern history, and the numbers are obviously much bigger if you include regional people travelling there. We talk a lot about the risk to the UK, and that is obviously there, but the bigger risk in my view is groups like ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra becoming entrenched in north and north-east Syria, and using that as a platform for attacks against regional targets—targets in southern Turkey or targets in places like Amman, where I think there is a much more permissive environment for these groups to operate. Iraq obviously has such a high degree of violence—it doesn’t need Syria to be a springboard for violence. It has its own platforms within. Again, one of the reasons why Hezbollah is so keen to fight in the Qalamoun mountain area—to sever these links and fight where it is fighting now—is not just to aid the Syrian regime. It is not just at the orders of Iran. It is also to prevent Sunni fundamentalist groups re-entering Lebanon and attacking its own strongholds, as we have seen over the past eight or nine months. In other words, even Hezbollah itself sees this problem as affecting its own areas in Beirut.&#xa0;

[[[              ]]]

[[[Q40 Mark ]]]

[[[Hendrick]]]

[[[:]]] Do you think there is anything that the West—meaning the United States or Britain and France—could have or should have done earlier that might have made the outcome in Syria less harmful and more manageable in terms of finding a solution that can lead to a Geneva II that satisfies most of the players in the area?              

[[[Shashank Joshi:]]] It is possible that a more concerted effort to secure a diplomatic solution very early on, before the opposition had become so fragmented, before the extremists within the opposition ranks had become so powerful as they are now and before the moderate opposition had become so enfeebled, might have had more chances of success. I am not sure that that would have yielded much because at that time, Russia’s position was completely unyielding as well. It is possible that we could have done much more to restrict the inflow of funds to extremists from non-official sources early in the conflict, particularly from Turkey. That is something I think that could have been done much earlier on as well.&#xa0;

[[[              ]]]

[[[Q41 Mike Gapes:]]] Can I take up this point about extremist connections? We heard earlier about the Iraqi Maliki Government giving political support to the Assad regime and perhaps other support as well. On the other hand, we have jihadist groups coming out of Iraq originally, going into Syria, and now we have Syrian jihadis coming back into Iraq, including the terrorist attack on the Kurdish region in September, which I understand has links to this conflict. Is there therefore going to have to be an internal political settlement in Iraq before we can stabilise the situation in Syria?              

[[[Shashank Joshi:]]] No, I am not sure that is the case. It wouldn’t hurt of course. Both of the branches of al-Qaeda in Syria are sort of offshoots of al-Qaeda’s branch in Iraq—both ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra. By and large, I don’t think they require sanctuary or support in Iraq to sustain themselves in Syria. Of course, it is the case that a more inclusive political settlement in Syria, one in which Iraqi Sunni communities did not feel victimised by the Maliki Government, would be beneficial to dampening support for extremists in Iraq, and that would have a knock-on effect in Syria. But I am not sure: this is sufficiently internal to Syria that it doesn’t really require a wholesale political settlement in Iraq.&#xa0;

[[[              ]]]

[[[Q42 Chair:]]] Moving to the chemical weapons situation, do you think that the disarmament process is weakening Assad and not making any difference at all?              

[[[Shashank Joshi:]]] I think it isn’t making any difference. I think it temporarily strengthened him insofar as there was stronger US interest in continuity of government. That is, those units protecting chemical weapons, particularly specialised units of the Syrian armed forces—the US had far less interest and was inclined to see them preserved and stay in one piece. That obviously constitutes a sort of safety net for Assad. I think a lot of the criticism directed at the CW deal—the disarmament plan—was criticising the US for precluding actions that it was never going to take anyway. That is, for preventing it from engaging in a wholesale intervention. I mean, as we heard from Secretary of State John Kerry, it was going to be an “unbelievably small” strike. It was not going to be a regime-threatening strike. It would have targeted some elite military units and would have had a concrete impact on Assad’s effectiveness, but after that point, now that the disarmament effort is under way, I do not see why it would particularly strengthen Assad. Once the process continues, there will be less and less need for co-operation with the Assad regime anyway and he will be almost back to where he started.&#xa0;

[[[              ]]]

[[[Q43 Chair:]]] The whole chemical weapons situation, in effect, led to the announcement that Geneva II would take place on 22 January. You mentioned Russia in answer to a question from Mr Hendrick. Do you think we need Iran at the table?              

[[[Shashank Joshi:]]] It depends on the point of Geneva II. If the point is to reach a comprehensive political settlement that can secure peace, you need all combatants and their supporters, which absolutely includes Iran. But my question would be: who in Iran? Iran is not necessarily a perfectly monolithic state. The nuclear deal was successful because the Supreme Leader empowered his President and his Foreign Minister to deal on the specific issue of the nuclear programme. On Syria, there are other parts of the Iranian state that have more levers on policy, notably the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. They are not going to be sitting at the table at Geneva II; it will be the Foreign Ministry. Those on the Iranian side who are able to make concessions and deal will not be attending the Geneva II process. Personally, I do not see that anything productive will come out of Geneva II next month.              

[[[Chair:]]] How depressing.              

[[[Shashank Joshi:]]] Look at the opposition. How can it? Six of the Islamic Front’s seven groups are saying that anyone who attends from the FSA will be treated as a collaborator with Assad. You have the coalition itself saying that it will attend only under stringent conditions, including humanitarian corridors. If you want the Islamic Front at the table, I just do not see the Assad regime negotiating with them. I just cannot see what comes out of this. If the purpose is much more modest—if it is only to secure tactical-level humanitarian access—I see absolutely no harm in having people around a table to discuss that.&#xa0;              

[[[Q44 Chair:]]] As I understand it, Geneva II is just aimed at tactical positioning.              

[[[Shashank Joshi:]]] Geneva I had principles of political transition, so the ultimate aim is still a political transition away from the Assad regime.&#xa0;              

[[[Q45 Mike Gapes:]]] May I ask you about the debate on arming the opposition? The European Union, at British and French insistence, ended its arms embargo, but it has not subsequently supplied lethal equipment to the opposition. What would have been the effect of doing so? What are the implications of the current position for the standing of the UK and the other EU countries with regard to the attitude of the opposition?              

[[[Shashank Joshi:]]] It depends on the level of vetting that would have been applied. President Obama signed a secret finding for the CIA to provide arms in April, but almost nothing happened for several months. The subsequent flow was an absolute trickle because the procedures for who could get the arms were so stringent. The trade-off is, the more stringent your vetting, the smaller your flow of arms. The Obama Administration’s nominee to run special operations at the Defence Department was asked about that in a congressional hearing. He was asked, “Would the US programme to train rebels at the present level make a strategic difference?” He said, “No, it wouldn’t.”&#xa0;              

[[[Q46 Mike Gapes:]]] What about the EU?              

[[[Shashank Joshi:]]] Well, the EU would not have done so on any greater scale than the US, so there is absolutely no way that it would have made more of a difference than US supplies.&#xa0;              

[[[Q47 Mike Gapes:]]] What about the attitude and the perception among the opposition?              

[[[Shashank Joshi:]]] Which opposition?&#xa0;              

[[[Q48 Mike Gapes:]]] Presumably we were not going to be arming the al-Nusra Front, but arguing for supposedly secular or moderate opposition. What is their attitude to the fact that they thought they were going to be given great assistance, particularly by the US but also by European countries, but now they are not?              

[[[Shashank Joshi:]]] There was obviously a sense of embitterment, and I am sure that did persuade some proportion of the moderate opposition to move in the direction of groups such as the Islamic Front when they felt that there was going to be no serious outside support form those who had suggested that there might be. However, I think they would also have been sorely disappointed by the scale at which the support would actually have occurred. Would it actually have brought sufficient good will to stave off the developments that we are now seeing? I am not so sure about that.&#xa0;              

[[[Q49 Mike Gapes:]]] What about the abortive decision on the air strikes, which we touched on earlier? How has that been perceived by the opposition, as well as by the Assad regime? Assad is obviously relieved because he is able to have at least another year in power while the chemical deal is concluded, but how do the opposition perceive what happened?              

[[[Shashank Joshi:]]] They were furious and understandably so. They expected huge tactical opportunities opening up, particularly around Damascus. The way in which the reversal occurred was seen as particularly galling, and I think that they saw this deal as having essentially legitimised Assad’s grip on power. I would not agree with all those assessments, but it would be silly to deny that they were absolutely furious.&#xa0;              

[[[Q50 Mike Gapes:]]] Does that make it likely that any opposition-led Syria—if there is such a thing—would be more radical and hostile to western interests than would otherwise have been the case?              

[[[Shashank Joshi:]]] Possibly, but I would also say, look at Libya, where there was extensive NATO air support for rebels and many of those rebels, who were the beneficiaries of that support, are still perfectly happy to have alliances of expedience with al-Qaeda-aligned militias in the east of Libya. So, on the whole, I think it does buy good will, and we did engender some bitterness. Would it have had a huge change in attitude of the opposition beyond what would otherwise have been the case? I am not persuaded.&#xa0;              

[[[Q51 Mike Gapes:]]] Do you agree with Professor Gerges that a military strike would have been a disaster?              

[[[Shashank Joshi:]]] No, I don’t agree at all. I think it could have had a powerful deterrent effect. I also think that the diplomatic solution that was reached was a sensible one.&#xa0;              

[[[Q52 Sandra Osborne:]]] Can I ask you about the situation in Lebanon and the prospect of a civil war there? How likely do you think that is and what can the UK and others do to shore up the situation?              

[[[Shashank Joshi:]]] It is very hard, because Lebanon almost asymptotically approaches civil war every year. It is particularly fragile at the moment because of this neutral sense of vulnerability. Hezbollah feels its own strongholds have been continuously attacked since May and that the rise of a Syrian opposition within Syria poses dangers to it that it hasn’t seen in a long while. I think the Syrian opposition within Lebanon sees opportunities here as well. On the whole, everyone understands Hezbollah remains the single most powerful military actor within Lebanon and that a breakdown of the status quo would not necessarily mean Hezbollah falling from power, but only a messy war in which Hezbollah would once again emerge on top.              I am not sure that Hezbollah’s opponents really want to pull down the entire system just yet. I also think its grip on power is fairly strong. We have seen a series of pretty impressive attacks, notably the attack on the Iranian embassy in Beirut, which was almost unprecedented in that sense, but it is not really threatening Hezbollah’s grip on power, in my opinion.              Overall, Hezbollah’s political standing within Lebanon has plummeted. Its cross-sectarian appeal has plummeted—it is seen more and more as a sectarian actor than it ever was, particularly compared with how it was in 2006, when it was seen to resist Israeli aggression by many segments of Lebanese society. So it is severely weakened, but I am not sure that I would predict a civil war within the next year or so in Lebanon.&#xa0;              

[[[Q53 Sandra Osborne:]]] What about the situation with refugees from Syria? Lebanon, in particular, but other neighbouring countries already support quite high numbers of refugees, including the Palestinians. What is going to happen with that in the longer term? How sustainable is that for the foreseeable future?              

[[[Shashank Joshi:]]] It poses a lot of risks, particularly radicalisation within those camps. If they come to be seen as sources of support for Sunni extremists by Hezbollah, you could see some pretty messy conflicts emerge. Hezbollah is already very concerned about hitting back at what it sees as Sunni areas of support in parts of Lebanon. They could easily become more militarised. They could easily become sources of extremism, radicalisation and militancy. From a purely humanitarian point of view, the more the fighting escalates around places like Damascus, the greater these flows will become. The Lebanese state is not in a position to provide adequate care for these groups over the longer term. We have known that for a while and the same is true in Jordan as well. So that is not a new development as such.&#xa0;

[[[              ]]]

[[[Chair:]]] Thank you very much for coming along. As ever, your evidence is to the point. We really appreciate it and hope we can call on your services again.              

[[[Shashank Joshi:]]] Of course, you’re welcome.&#xa0;

[[[Examination of Witnesses]]]Witnesses: 

[[[Shiraz]]]

[[[ Maher]]], Senior Fellow, International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation, King’s College London, and 

[[[Dr Rim ]]]

[[[Turkmani]]], Director, Madani, gave evidence.&#xa0;              

[[[Q54 Chair:]]] For our third and final session of the day, I welcome Shiraz Maher, Senior Fellow, International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation, King’s College London, and Dr Rim Turkmani, Director of Madani.              Dr Turkmani, I looked up what Madani is, and it seems you are very much focused on a peaceful solution in Syria. Do you feel that is rather pushing water uphill at the moment?              

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Turkmani]]]

[[[:]]] I do not see anything but a peaceful solution to this crisis. There is no violent way or military strategy that can end this crisis. Certainly, speaking as somebody who does not believe that violence is the right way to settle any conflict, we do still insist on peaceful solutions.              

[[[Q55 Chair:]]] Mr Maher, you are an expert on radicalisation. Do you feel that there is any prospect that the various warring groups can gel together as a co-ordinated opposition?              

[[[Shiraz Maher:]]] I think I would largely agree with the answer given by Shashank in that respect. There is no real reason or incentive for them to coalesce into one broad opposition. The problem we have now as well is that, of course, at some stage there will need to be a political solution and a negotiated settlement to end this crisis. The problem now is very complicated because of the presence al-Qaeda-aligned fighters from Jabhat al-Nusra and ISIS, ad-Dawla al-Islamiyya. Even if we were able to cajole some of the groups in the Islamic Front to come to the table to negotiate—I think we will be able to, with the passage of time, though not at this stage—we still face a huge, quite insurmountable, problem about how we resolve the problem of the jihadists now.&#xa0;

[[[              ]]]

[[[Q56 Rory Stewart]]]

[[[:]]] Dr Turkmani, when the UK Parliament voted on whether to intervene in Syria, what do you think would have been the consequence if they had intervened in the way proposed?              

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Turkmani]]]

[[[:]]] This is a very complex conflict. It is difficult to make any prediction, but the strategy that was proposed suggested that it did not aim to end the regime. I think what would have happened is a weaker regime. Nobody still would be able to finish it, and the regime itself would not be able to settle the crisis. I certainly think it would have seen direct interference from supporters of the regime, such as Iran, that would have been even stronger than the current involvement. I think everybody underestimated the desire of Russia, Iran and China to support the regime. Any direct military attack on the Syrian regime would have been seen as a direct attack on Russia and Iran. I do not think the recent breakthrough on the diplomatic front between Iran and the US would have been achieved had there been a military strike against the Syrian regime.&#xa0;              

[[[Q57 Rory Stewart:]]] What do you think, as a Syrian who is an opponent of Bashar al-Assad? What is your sense of how elements of the Syrian population would have perceived a western intervention and military strike of that sort?              

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Turkmani]]]

[[[:]]] People were very divided. At the moment when intervention was proposed, people had already lost hope. Most Syrians were living under very severe conditions, suffering from cold weather and hunger. So many would have said, “Yes, anything that brings a solution.” At the same time, many people said, “No, we don’t want western intervention.” I think that people would have been more interested in seeing the result of this. Probably, if the strike had ended the regime, they would have said, “That is great,” but most of the people I spoke to failed to see an end to the regime through military strikes—certainly not at that level—when the strike was mentioned.&#xa0;              

[[[Q58 Rory Stewart:]]] The Professor stated that the West underestimated Assad’s strength and support, and underestimated the Syrian army. What in your experience leads the British Government to make such mistakes in their assessment?              

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Turkmani]]]

[[[:]]] I think the UK misread the situation from the start. Its research on Syria was already very weak. If you look at think-tanks and universities in the UK, you can see that very little analysis and research is done on Syria. The same applies to the experts at the Foreign Office, even those who speak Arabic and focus on Syria. To compensate for that, the UK should have focused on its embassy staff in Syria early on in the crisis. They should have been kept on the ground to listen to people. The UK should listen to the Syrians and not to people sitting outside the country. It should not have followed the American strategy and should have listened to Syrians.              The UK quickly cut all diplomatic ties and withdrew all ambassadors and embassy staff. We wanted them to be ambassadors for the people, not for the regime. We did not want the ambassador to go and talk to the regime; we wanted him to read the situation and to talk to the Syrian people to see what they wanted. Very early on, economic sanctions were applied just to respond to the pressure from the public, who were saying that something must be done. Although we argued a lot for them, there was the view from inside Syria that sanctions never change a regime, and that the people, not the regime, would pay the price. Sanctions legitimise the illegal economy and de-legitimise the official economy, and that is what happened. That is one reason why we have a war economy right now. Nobody listened to the views. These are old views that we have written and that have appeared in statements and letters from people inside Syria. Nobody has listened. We argued that the UK should not increase international polarisation by joining a bloc against a bloc. We said that it is becoming an international conflict, and we need an international consensus to resolve it.              Joining the Friends of Syria will not help Syrians. Just thinking “We need to oppose the regime” is sticking to the strategy that we have to do whatever it takes to bash the regime, which is not helping Syrians. We have to help the Syrians. I think the UK failed to listen to voices from inside the country and very quickly followed the US strategy, which was already not very clear.&#xa0;              

[[[Q59 Rory Stewart:]]] So it is a failure of the embassy. Your perception, as a British Syrian, is that the embassy was not getting out and talking to people on the ground enough.              

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Turkmani]]]

[[[:]]] I think that when the embassy staff were in Syria, they were talking to people, but they were quickly asked to leave Damascus. When they were back in the UK, they were quickly swapped with people who had not been in Syria. Simon Collis, the ambassador in Damascus, was sent somewhere else. Frances Guy was appointed and she has done great work, but after she established good relations with the Syrian opposition, she was swapped with somebody else who had not been to Syria and who did not know the situation inside. Even the staff of the Syria desk are changed all the time. The people who worked at the embassy, who knew the people and who had a much better reading of the situation inside Syria, were moved to completely different departments.&#xa0;

[[[              ]]]

[[[Q60 Rory Stewart:]]] Finally, what is your sense, Shiraz, of how the British Government have failed to listen to voices and to get their assessment right? What mechanisms led the British Government to underestimate the resilience of the Syrian regime, for example?              

[[[Shiraz Maher:]]] Three points spring to mind. We fundamentally failed to understand fully the unique composition of Syrian society, and how the various tensions and otherwise would play out, as accentuated by the crisis. There was a sense that we had seen this before. We saw it with Egypt and Libya, where the Governments put on pro-Government demonstrations in an attempt to bolster support and to demonstrate the legitimacy of their own regimes. Of course, they crumbled away very quickly in both cases. Early on in Syria, when the Government put on their own displays of power, we were perhaps more dismissive.              There is certainly residual support for Assad. It is by no means a majority, but there is certainly a degree of support that he enjoys that is untypical of the kind of support that the other fallen regimes in Egypt or Libya had. There was a sense that we had seen this before, and that there would be a terminal ebbing of support for the Government as time went on. Of course, divisions have hardened, so the rebel side has hardened into a protracted position and the supporters of the regime have become quite entrenched in their position.&#xa0;              

[[[Q61 Rory Stewart:]]] So how did the British Government get it wrong? What can they do to reform their systems to make sure they do not make the same mistakes again in other conflicts?              

[[[Shiraz Maher:]]] I would echo what Shashank said in his testimony, and what Dr Turkmani said: there needs to be data collection on the ground by embassy staff. I do not think it is just about embassy staff, though. The Foreign Office, like other Departments, is getting better at reaching out beyond the echo chamber of Westminster and talking not just to academics, but think-tanks, journalists, NGOs and groups that have a perspective on the ground, to get a better sense of what other stakeholders are experiencing and sensing.&#xa0;              

[[[Q62 Mark ]]]

[[[Hendrick]]]

[[[:]]] You both seem very critical of the Foreign Office’s knowledge of things, or the viewpoint that it took. Would you go so far as to say that when President Obama said that Assad would go, and that was almost immediately echoed here in London by our Prime Minister, the UK was just echoing the Americans, or was that based on objective analysis by the Foreign Office?              

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Turkmani]]]

[[[:]]] I think part of it was echoing the Americans; the other part was misreading the situation and the lack of brave political leadership in the UK. The UK had a great opportunity to lead politically in the Syrian crisis and to present a new vision, sticking to one strategy and to what it said, but it failed that opportunity. Very quickly, it fell into a polarising attitude, giving strong statements that did not necessarily help the Syrian people.&#xa0;              

[[[Q63 Mark ]]]

[[[Hendrick]]]

[[[:]]] Do you think this Government were seeing things through the prism of, for example, Libya and uprisings elsewhere, rather than seeing the genuine complexity in Syria, which we can see now?              

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Turkmani]]]

[[[:]]] I think in Libya, Tunisia and Egypt, some people expected that the Syrian regime would fall the same way the other Arab regimes fell, but they did not really understand the nature of the Syrian regime—how strongly the regime, the state, the intelligence services and the army are almost one thing. You cannot just overthrow this regime by making its President step down. There was so much focus on the President—more than he deserved—and the regime was far more complex than the person of the President. We can see this today: the regime is still committing huge atrocities, not just because of that one person, but because of what the Syrian regime is.              

[[[Shiraz Maher:]]] I do not wish to come across as critical of the Foreign Office. I actually think that the Foreign Office and other Government agencies that have been tasked with dealing with the various eruptions of the Arab Spring have been dealing with quite a unique and unforeseeable series of events—a series of events that are not just localised, but often intertwined with a far greater series of regional issues. I think everyone is probably working as hard as they possibly can to make sense of these things and to contextualise them as best they can. Of course, there was a sense—I think you are right, in so far as our reading of Syria was characterised by events in North Africa—that the Government would eventually fall and that there would be a terminal decline. That has obviously proved not to be the case.&#xa0;              

[[[Q64 Mark ]]]

[[[Hendrick]]]

[[[:]]] Can I go on to the issue of jihadis? Dr Turkmani, you talk about not being able to solve anything through the use of military force. Some extremists—affiliates of al-Qaeda—do not really consider Shi’a to be genuine Muslims; they see a natural conflict there, and they see them as the enemy. If there is such a strong religious and ideological difference, how can it be resolved in any other way than by the method they are trying to use at the moment, which is conflict? Can I also ask you about the sense that this will come back home to wherever the jihadis come from? This will go back to the country they came from. They will have been hardened and trained, and to them, what they are doing seems totally justifiable, through their own understanding—or misunderstanding—of their doctrine. How are we going to resolve these issues? How do we get round that?              

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Turkmani]]]

[[[:]]] I think this applies not only to the jihadis who are fighting the regime, but to the extremists who are fighting on the side of the regime, such as people from Hezbollah, Iran or Iraq. The issue here is that, yes, the new authority may be obliged to fight in other ways those who refuse to join any peaceful solution, but the peaceful solution has to be offered first, and it has never been an option. On the contrary, the option of escalating the violence created the ground that gave rise to all the jihadists. There was no jihadist group in Syria that began straight away in an area of Syria where there was no fighting. Jihadism does not arise from a safe area. First violence spreads into the area, with the regime attacking the people and people responding. Then it gets far more complex, and becomes a pointless conflict with support from outside for both sides. That creates a perfect environment for jihadism. You have a failed state, you have violence and you have people who are desperate. This makes it very easy for people to be recruited.              I am a Syrian, I know Syrian people and I grew up in Syria. I want to emphasise that the people who make up the body of these groups are not as you describe. They are merely Syrians who found no other options and no other way to go. They were very desperate. Yes, the leadership of the jihadist groups is extreme and will continue to fight any coming authority, regardless of who wins this conflict, but we have a chance of taking these human resources from them if we offer peace. If we look at young Syrians who are joining the jihadists because there is no other way, I think we have a huge opportunity to weaken this extreme mentality.              

[[[Shiraz Maher:]]] You mentioned the sectarian element and disregard for the Shi’a community. I want to add to that in two ways. First, I largely echo what Dr Turkmani said about what is happening on the ground in Syrian society. Prior to the uprising, it was not an extremist society. It was not a society where there was a great flourishing of these takfiri ideas, for want of a better phrase. Clearly, that is flourishing right now in the current context.              My second point is that I diverge a little from others in thinking that it is getting increasingly difficult to de-radicalise people. People are being brutalised by conflict and being radicalised by what they have seen. You have to bear in mind the organisations’ memberships. Jabhat al-Nusra has more of a Syrian character, whereas ISIS, ad-Dawla al-Islamiyya, or the Islamic State is more composed of a foreign fighter contingent, and of foreigners per se who came with that organisation. They are not fighting 24 hours a day. They might spend two days of the week fighting, and they spend the rest of their time in religious indoctrination classes. A large part of the classes involves really absorbing and imbibing the al-Qaeda narrative and its world view.              Our centre has been in touch with a number of Britons who are in Syria right now, fighting with jihadist organisations. It is quite telling: we can see from our interactions with them that they have adopted wholesale that ideology and that world view. They must have been radicalised to an extent before leaving the West, because that would have motivated their departure. However, if they were not already highly radicalised before they left the West, we can say with a degree of confidence that even those who do return to the West will bring with them the very devastating world view that we have seen proliferate over the last decade or so.&#xa0;              

[[[Q65 Mike Gapes:]]] May I put to you a scenario that you might say is fanciful? If the international community and particularly the United States had decided to bring in a no-fly zone in April or May 2011, before the radicalisation, and had not betrayed the secular people who were calling for democratic change, might the circumstances now be completely different? I suggest that because there was no stomach here or in Washington for any form of involvement, and because of weariness about Afghanistan, Iraq and wherever, interventionism was not fashionable. It therefore did not happen, and we now reap the consequences of that.              

[[[Shiraz Maher:]]] My perception is that you are correct. That was very much my view in 2011 and even up until the start of 2012. Once the siege of Baba Amr in Homs started, where Marie Colvin was killed, I think that was the real tipping point, when Syrian people themselves really started to realise that there was no alternative but to pick up arms and to form military resistance against the regime.              Into that vacuum, of course, the people that were best placed to capitalise on that chaos were the jihadists. It was their narrative that could offer salvation, their narrative that offered confidence; and of course they had an ability to pick up arms and resources, and to reactivate informal networks, around the Gulf in particular, of funding and foreign fighters and so on, that they had utilised against western coalition forces in Iraq. So they had the expertise, the know-how and the ability to exploit the growing chaos within Syria.              I think if you look at what a lot of the Syrian opposition was saying at the time, it was calling for a degree of intervention, but that does not mean putting boots on the ground. I think, particularly in public discourse, there was a real lack of understanding: people imagined an Iraq type of scenario, where we literally had tanks and soldiers rolling through into the capital. If we had imposed some sort of no-fly zone, and worked with the rebels on the ground, we could have, in the way we did in Libya, established a transitional authority on the ground. One of the big problems we have in Syria right now is that there is no one who can claim to represent the opposition and is on the ground and holds legitimacy. We have heard lots about the Syrian Islamic Front right now saying that the Syrian National Council does not represent them, that they will not be represented at Geneva, and that is because they are not on the ground; they are not within Syria, and we have had no ability to set up a transitional authority inside the country.&#xa0;              

[[[Q66 Mike Gapes:]]] Dr Turkmani, do you agree with that view?              

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Turkmani]]]

[[[:]]] No, I don’t.&#xa0;              

[[[Q67 Mike Gapes:]]] Why not?              

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Turkmani]]]

[[[:]]] I completely disagree. In the period that you refer to, people were being killed mainly in non-violent demonstrations and in the basement of the intelligence offices, in detention centres. I do not see how a no-fly zone can protect those people.&#xa0;              

[[[Q68 Mike Gapes:]]] What could have protected them?              

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Turkmani]]]

[[[:]]] Maybe not to put the killer in the corner. I think the main killer was the Syrian regime. The Syrian regime is the Syrian Mukhabarat intelligence, the leadership of the army and the presidency, and these have been pushed further and further into the corner. They were pushed into a corner where they felt an existential threat—[Laughter.]&#xa0;              

[[[Q69 Mike Gapes:]]] I do not understand what you mean by “put in the corner”. If a regime is carrying out brutal violence against peaceful protesters, how can the peaceful protesters prevent that brutal violence, except, presumably, by no longer protesting? Is that—              

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Turkmani]]]

[[[:]]] You did not ask me what the protesters should do. You asked what the external forces should have done. What I am saying is: who had the power in that country? It was the regime. I am talking about the period you referred to: the first four months. It was the regime that was the strongest party; it was the regime that was killing, right? So when this regime was confronted with any level of violence, even just one bullet, it would respond 100 times more violently. So surely by confronting it with violence, we were just calling for more and more violence from the regime.              There are so many examples. I will just give you one that I know of. The area of al-Waer, the suburb of Homs where my sister and family live, was a safe area, where most of the people of Homs resorted to. It was safe; it was highly populated. The regime did not interfere with this area—not because of its good will, but, for whatever reason, it did not interfere with it. Once fighting groups took a decision to enter this area—and there was a firm decision; it was not self-defence—the regime decided to send missiles and to apply a blockade. Somebody died in the cold weather in that rich area. So, yes, violence got the worst out of the regime. We knew that it is in control of the country, and this is how it is going to respond, and kill its own people. There is nothing funny about this.              

[[[Mike Gapes:]]] I am not finding it funny.              

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Turkmani]]]

[[[:]]] I am not talking to you, sir.              

[[[Chair:]]] Before you go any further, Mike, can I just say to members of the audience here that we listen to witnesses with respect in this Committee, and if you are unable to do so, then I am going to ask you to leave the Committee.&#xa0;              

[[[Q70 Mike Gapes:]]] Can I ask about the attitude of the opposition now to intervention? It is a similar question to what I asked earlier. Clearly, the decision was taken in August not to have military action. There was also, in effect, a decision not to provide lethal weaponry to the opposition, even though the European Union had lifted its arms embargo. What is your take on the opposition’s attitude to the international community, given the failure from 2011 and where we are now? Has that played a major role in radicalisation?              

[[[Shiraz Maher:]]] It is very problematic to talk about a monolithic opposition in this regard. If we start at the jihadist end of the spectrum, there is no desire to see any form of western or European interaction or involvement in the Syrian conflict. They want to do it themselves and they believe they have the ability to do this, so there is no desire or will to see any form of co-operation.              As you move towards the more conservative Salafi organisations that form part of the new Islamic Front, with groups such as Liwa al-Tawhid and so on, they have their own channels and ability to get weapons, arms, munitions and so on. They are doing that largely through gulf and private networks as well as semi-formal ones. Again, as we talk to them, the perception seems to be very much, “We know what we are doing and we know who we are dealing with. We are happy to continue.”              I think there is a sense that, essentially, people have given up on the West. It is very interesting to watch the migration of the chants and slogans of the Syrian revolution over the last three years as that is a good barometer of what people have been seeing. Now, there is very much a sense of, “This is not your revolution any more, Obama. This is for us, and we will take it in this direction—whether you like it or not.” That is the point: the West has lost any ability to have any say any more in what the future trajectory of Syria or its revolution is.&#xa0;              

[[[Q71 Mike Gapes:]]] So the choice now is between a Ba’athist regime backed by Russia, Iran and Hezbollah and a radicalised Islamist movement that rejects democratic, western, secular values?              

[[[Shiraz Maher:]]] Unfortunately, my reading of the situation is that the great loss and betrayal of the Syrian revolution is that it has fallen to one of two scenarios—essentially, you are faced with the chip pan and the fire. It did not have to be that way, but unfortunately it has degenerated into such a state now that that is what we are faced with. You have to bear in mind that the strongest fighting forces right now are, if not the al-Qaeda elements, the conservative Islamists on the ground. The FSA has largely become a redundant fighting force on the ground. So who is left, ultimately, to take the military campaign forward?&#xa0;              

[[[Q72 Mike Gapes:]]] Do you agree with that perception, Dr Turkmani?              

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Turkmani]]]

[[[:]]] No, it is not either the regime or a radicalised opposition. I think this is how the regime wanted us to see things. It created the image of an evil opponent so that we would say, “It is this or the regime,” so that the answer would be the regime. The answer has to be power sharing, but power sharing means no more regime. If Geneva I or Geneva II is implemented, the result will be a new coalition and new authority. The regime will be part of that, but the whole thing will not be the regime.&#xa0;              

[[[Q73 Mike Gapes:]]] Why should anyone in the Assad regime or the Alawite community agree to those terms at this moment?              

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Turkmani]]]

[[[:]]] Because it is the only safe exit. The regime itself in two and a half years failed to deliver. It failed to win politically and it failed to win militarily—it failed on every front and it cannot carry on like this any more. The regime failed its own loyalists and it did not even deliver what it promised its own state supporters, such as Russia and Iran. It failed to lead and it failed to manage the conflict, so it cannot carry on like this. The only safe exit now is through the only channel open to the regime: to share power in the Government of Syria. I am not saying that it will accept that necessarily. There does not seem to be enough international will for that to happen. The regime is now behaving as a Russian agent, not as a regime for its own people. So if the international balance does not change, I do not see a real political change happening out of this.              However, I would like to emphasise that here we are all talking about the military groups and the regime, and nobody is talking about the Syrian people, especially those who started the uprising and the Syrian civil society. The new emerging power in Syria is the Syrian civil society. It is still in its infancy and still cannot be compared to the international mature civil society, but there are numerous Syrian civil groups that are very active on the ground and able to deliver on the ground. It is in their best interest for the killing to stop, to have a ceasefire and for the crisis to be over, whereas it is not necessarily in the best interest of warlords to end the crisis. If there are to be peace talks, I would rather have at the table those who have an interest in ending the crisis, not just parties that are gaining from the continuation of the conflict. That is why I would argue that there should be much stronger involvement of the new player on the ground: Syrian civil society.&#xa0;              

[[[Q74 Sandra Osborne:]]] What is your take on the refugee situation and the people who have been displaced within Syria? How can a civil society develop in such circumstances, within such a violent situation, in a way that could bring about peace?              

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Turkmani]]]

[[[:]]] What was the first part of the question? I am sorry, I did not hear it.              

[[[Sandra Osborne:]]] It was about the refugees and people who have been displaced within Syria. How does that square with the development of a civil society that could bring about peace in such violent circumstances? I do not really understand how that is practical.              

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Turkmani]]]

[[[:]]] Even within the refugee community itself—there are now millions outside Syria—there are numerous civil society groups serving that community. I just came back from Gaziantep in Turkey, where there are half a million Syrians and numerous civil society groups responding to the needs of the Syrian society, or helping the Syrian society inside the country. There are still so many Syrians inside the country, and we have to ask: who is running the society? Is it the political groups? No. Is it the military groups? No. It is the silent player in the background: the newly emerging civil society. It is delivering services, offering protection, delivering food, assisting the wounded and doing media work. The more I engage with it, the more I look for them and am impressed with their ability to be active in an environment so very hostile to any civil action.              I want to go back to the point about where the UK got it wrong, and to the point about civil society. It is a public movement, and public movements take time to develop leadership. When the UK decided to recognise the opposition in exile as the sole legitimate representative of the Syrian people, it actually removed the opportunity for the real leadership—the grass roots leadership—to emerge from within civil society circles to lead the movement and become its real voice, expressing the real needs of Syrian society and calling for a solution. Instead, the UK recognised people who live most of the time in France or in the UK. The people inside Syria were saying, “Those people do not represent us.”              I would say that the leadership model was applied was wrong. The leadership should have come from the bottom up, not from the top down. I think there was interference with the Syrian public movement to impose a particular leadership on them and to recognise a particular player as the sole legitimate representative. Who is any non-Syrian party to decide who is the legitimate representative? The Syrian regime is not legitimate; how can anyone else decide who the legitimate party is?&#xa0;              

[[[Q75 Sandra Osborne:]]] Do you agree with the previous witness that there is potential for radicalisation among refugees both within Syria and in other countries, such as Lebanon? What are your views on that?              

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Turkmani]]]

[[[:]]] On radicalisation?

[[[              ]]]

[[[Sandra Osborne:]]] Yes, on extremism—the potential to become involved and radicalised because of being in these camps and having the experience of a refugee. I think you will have heard the previous witness suggest that.              

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Turkmani]]]

[[[:]]] Most of the people in the camps are women and children and the elderly, so it is difficult to radicalise them. However, there is now a new emerging group that is really dangerous: children at 12 or 13 years old are being routed in the same direction as happened to those in the Palestinian camps, where the PLO got more human resources. They are now being called to join this violent conflict. This is certainly very dangerous but again who is in the camps? It is certainly not the fighters, not the young people who have been brutalised.&#xa0;&#xa0;              

[[[Q76 Sandra Osborne:]]] Do you have any comments?              

[[[Shiraz Maher:]]] People have been brutalised on such a large scale and, of course, people in the camps are not immune to that. They are suffering in a unique and particular way that exposes them and makes them vulnerable to radicalisation. We are seeing younger people than before being radicalised—the example of the Palestinian connection is a good one. Certainly, again, with a lot of the jihadists we interact with and talk to and whose media output we monitor, you are seeing individuals as young as 13 and 14 serving within their ranks—not to a significant extent but it is happening. Again, if this conflict is protracted and continues over many years you would expect to see those numbers grow over time.              I want to come back to one of the points about the civil society. It is difficult to see quite what shape and manner this civil society movement we are hearing about is taking. Ultimately, if they are the ones delivering the infrastructure now away from the state—delivering food into certain areas and so on—you have to ask who is opening up the supply lines to ensure those food supplies can get in. You are seeing a starvation campaign take place right now on the outskirts of Damascus. Who was it who went down to those parts to try to reopen supply routes in? It was the jihadist fighters, unfortunately. So even these civil society organisations are having to cut deals and do business with the jihadists.              Ultimately, no matter who goes to the talking table now in order to cut a deal and to make a political union that can resolve the conflict and bring it to an end, I don’t see how that is possible unless the jihadists, who are increasingly dominating the fighting, agree to it. They, of course, as we have seen over many, many years are not ones to negotiate and are not ones to enter into any kind of political settlement. You are right, Dr Turkmani, to say this is precisely what Assad wanted. Assad, looking at this conflict back in 2011, was looking at what happened to Gaddafi and so on, thinking “How do I prevent the West coming in? I have to create this counterweight.” So the West is faced with this bipolar disparity, Assad on the one hand and the jihadists on the other. It has been a masterstroke by the Ba’athist regime in what it has produced.&#xa0;              

[[[Q77 Chair:]]] A final question: is there anything that could be done to persuade President Assad to allow food and medicine through to the communities under siege? Do you think he would agree to it under any circumstances?              

[[[Shiraz Maher:]]] I have seen no evidence of that at any stage of this conflict.&#xa0;              

[[[Q78 Chair:]]] Is he using the lack of food and medicine as a tool of repression?              

[[[Shiraz Maher:]]] It is a tool of repression. As Professor Gerges pointed out, Damascus is obviously the jewel in the crown. They are making it very clear that the fight for Damascus will be an existential zero sum game. In that context, they are willing to show already the extent to which they will go to defend the capital.              

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Turkmani]]]

[[[:]]] I have been involved in some negotiations to allow humanitarian aid into some of the areas under siege. The regime did not collaborate in most of these cases.              It always helps if there is a mediator and a monitor, and we don’t have those two elements for any negotiations to succeed. The international community withdrew the very limited numbers of political teams and monitors who were present in Syria at some point. Without them, people will have to go to the jihadists or the Red Crescent or whoever is a player right now on the Syrian land.              I think the focus has to go back on to the humanitarian situation. It is unimaginable that in the 21st century we have people dying of hunger and of the cold weather in a rich country like Syria. It is unbelievable. It is a shame on all of us. Any player who is a party to this conflict is responsible for this. We have to shift back the focus on to the humanitarian crisis and to pressure whoever, whether it is the regime or any other player, to allow humanitarian access for those people.              It does not always work, but the pressure has to carry on. Everybody has to be made responsible. There must be further engagement; we need more people in Syria. We need Mr Brahimi’s team to be larger—in Syria, for example, there are few people. What can they do? There is no international presence and the regime can do whatever it wants. It can get away with anything. There are hardly any journalists, diplomats or monitors. Without those, it is certainly going to be very difficult for any deal to succeed and to carry on.              A ceasefire is desperately needed. This is a complex crisis and we cannot see a simple solution, but certainly a ceasefire can be applied in certain areas of Syria. I sent at least one very important ceasefire plan to the representative of the UK Government to the Syrian opposition. I told them that the regime agreed to the plan, and Mr Annan agreed to it. I did not even get an answer by e-mail that they had seen the plan. When I asked about it again, it was completely ignored, and that was more than a year ago when it was possible to have a ceasefire.              I really want to stress that we have to put peace as the A and B option—not just A; not just say we want peace, and option B is to lift the ban on arming on other fronts. If we believe in peace, we have to be committed to peace. We have to do whatever it takes to achieve peace. The UK has claimed it is all for peaceful transition, but in reality we have not seen a strategy that is strong enough to support this claim.              

[[[Chair:]]] You have to recognise there are limits to what a single country can do from several thousand miles away. Anyway, thank you very much for giving us your opinions, both of you. It is very much appreciated.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;              Oral evidence: The crisis in Syria and the impact upon its neighbours, HC 899                            3
