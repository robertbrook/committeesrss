defaultDoes the Government have an effective strategy for forensic science in the UK and is it sufficient to support forensic science R&amp;D and criminal justice?default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultDid the FSS transition and closure run smoothly and within budget?default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat impacts have the FSS’s closure had on (i) the criminal justice system and (ii) forensic science R&amp;D and training? In particular, have the appropriate quality standards and accreditation been rigorously maintained? (please provide evidence/examples)default&#xa0;

defaultHas the closure of the FSS resulted in a loss of intellectual wealth through its scientists leaving the forensic science profession, or the UK? (please provide evidence/examples)default&#xa0;
default30 reporting officers (ROs) from 
defaultthe 
defaultFSS London homicide team were TUPE’d to the MPS evidence recovery laboratory at Lambeth, together with approximately 70 examiners from the FSS homicide and sexual offences teams.  On face of it, this may be counted as them still being in forensic science profession, however the 30 ROs have effectively been deskilled by the operating model employed by the MPS – their new role is 
defaultfocused on the 
defaultrecover
defaulty of
default evidence rather than 
defaultits evaluation.  These 30 ROs
default are currently being trained to search items for blood and other body fluids and evidence types.  In the FSS these ROs, many of whom have 10-20 years of experience, carried out case evaluations and complex DNA interpretation as
default 
defaultwell as file review (peer review of another scientist’s statement).  In the MPS model they are not 
defaultable
default to use the
defaultir
default evaluation and DNA skills
default,
default resulting in a great loss of skill to the CJS and those who hold these skills at other FSPs being given increasing workloads. The TUPE’d staff are 
defaultcurrently
default undergo
defaulting a long
default training program 
defaultwhich is progressing slowly, 
defaultsuch that many are not yet signed off as competent to examine items themselves a year after transfer.  The same applies to file review – we understand that none of the 30 ROs are yet signed off to do MPS file review, something which many of them were highly skilled with in the FSS.   
default&#xa0;
defaultFor the FSS London ROs from the sexual offences team – at the present time the majority are still in forensic science.  This comprises 2 who became freelance consultants, one became a lecturer in forensic science and 12 went to other forensic providers (but largely on short term contracts) - however 4 of those 12 have 
defaultrecently
default been made redundant 
defaultby LGC
default.  In addition, 3 people left the profession
default;
default others are considering doing so as they are now without jobs or very unhappy in their current roles.
default&#xa0;defaultAre current arrangements for the FSS’s archives satisfactory? How could arrangements for the retention of case files and forensic materials in the UK be improved?default&#xa0;
