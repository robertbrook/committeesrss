[[[- Written evidence]]]&#xa0;The&#xa0;Byways and Bridleways Trust is one of the bodies prescribed in the&#xa0;Wildlife and Countryside Act &#xa0;1981 to receive notice of public path orders.&#xa0; Our interest is in the higher status public rights of way, especially in correct recording on the definitive map.&#xa0; BBT is pleased to answer questions 1 - 7 of the current Call for Written Evidence, and would like at the appropriate time to submit more detailed evidence on Clauses 12 - 18 and Schedule 6.&#xa0;Answers to General Questions as applying to Clauses 12-18 and Schedule 6 only:-&#xa0;Q1. Not in our opinion.&#xa0;Q2. A possible advantage is that amended primary legislation is easier for the citizen to find and understand. The legislative process is more open and can be better informed.&#xa0;Q3. We have some reservations and would like to offer detailed evidence at the appropriate time.&#xa0;Q4.&#xa0;Effectively - yes.&#xa0; Fairly - again we have some reservations, especially for voluntary bodies and individuals.&#xa0;Q5. It will benefit businesses concerned with activity in the countryside, if it succeeds in achieving a comprehensive network of bridleways and byways.&#xa0;Q6. There is potential for substantial benefit to consumers if, following legislation, the will is there on all sides to speed up completion of the definitive map and achieve a comprehensive network for riders, horse drivers&#xa0;and cyclists, not just for walkers.&#xa0;Q7.iv. A fully completed definitive map provides a very useful resource for education in various skills and branches of knowledge at all levels.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; vi.&#xa0; If the Bill succeeds in getting the historic ways fairly recorded, it will be of substantial benefit&#xa0;in enabling&#xa0;individuals to improve their health and well-being by activity in the countryside of their own choice and in their own time, as well as increasing the opportunities available for organised expeditions.&#xa0;I have to add that the definitive map process, begun in 1949, is a highly complex affair which several successive Acts have not succeeded in simplifying: the present economic climate and cut backs in Local Authority staffing do jeopardise the success of these proposals.&#xa0;Elizabeth Kirk&#xa0;&#xa0;( Lady Kirk, Trustee, Byways and Bridleways Trust.)16 September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
