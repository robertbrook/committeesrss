"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;DCLG Select Committee inquiry into Local Government Procurement&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by the West London Alliance&#xa0;Background to the West London Alliance&#xa0;\nThe WLA is a partnership of six\n&#xa0;\nWest London councils - Barnet, Brent, Ealing, Harrow, \nHillingdon and Hounslow.\n&#xa0;\nThese councils serve a population of 1.8 million people and have a joint annual expenditure of £3.8bn a year. There are over 77,000 VAT registered business and nearly 700,000 employees active in this West London area.\n&#xa0;\nThe WLA a\nims to: promote the interests of West London residents and businesses; improve and develop public services; and to reduce their costs through collaboration.\n&#xa0;\nIn addition to\n&#xa0;\nrepresenting the interests of West London in terms of economic development, transpor\nt and spatial planning policy, the WLA\n&#xa0;\nfacilitates a number of major improvement and efficiency programmes.\n&#xa0;\nThe WLA is also a founder member of the West London Partnership (WLP) which brings together the public, private and voluntary sectors in West Lond\non to promote the economic, social and environmental interests of West London businesses and residents.\n&#xa0;\nExecutive Summary&#xa0;\nThe West London Alliance coordinates collaborative procurement activity with and on behalf of member boroughs&#xa0;There are currently \nseven major\n \nimprovement and efficiency programmes in which WLA members collaborate when programmes align with their council’s objectives and plans.  Some programmes also involve working with other councils in London, particularly the Tri-Boroughs (Hammersm\nith &amp; Fulham, Westminster and the Royal Borough of Kensington &amp; Chelsea).  \n&#xa0;\nThe seven programmes are;\n&#xa0;\nFurther programmes are in development\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nAs well as improving services, the aim is to achieve savings\n and/\nor avoi\nd costs. The area target for this is at least £57m in the period up to 2016/17.  Programme delivery has been supported by grant aid from a number of sources, particularly Capital Ambition.  DCLG grant was awarded to LBH&amp;F on behalf of the WL Housing Partne\nrship, while the WestTrans Partnership secured grant from the TfL Sub Regional Fund.\n&#xa0;\nNB: Due to the nature of the WLA’s Collaborative Procurement activities this submission to the CLG select committee focuses mainly on questions 2 and 3. \nAccordingly Boroughs themselves will respond on the other four CLG questions directly.&#xa0;\nCollaborative Protocol&#xa0;\nIn managing WLA multi borough procurements we adopt a protocol that requires \nthe nomination of a lead borough for\n; \np\nrocurement\n, legal service, financial \nadvice, technical specification, HR, TUPE, IT, quality, safety and environment.\n  \nThe lead borough may be different for each discipline and each project. \n&#xa0;\nThe protocol requires that we place our collective trust on the integrity and robustness of the lead \nboroughs internal policies\n, \nprocesses \nand people \nto ensure rectitude.\n \n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe following extracts from the WLA’s annual report highlight some WLA partner boroughs \nsuccesses\n.\n&#xa0;\nParticipating councils: Barnet, Brent, Ealing, Hammersmith and Fulham, Harrow, Hillingdon, Hounslow.&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nParticipating councils: Barnet, Brent, Ealing, Hammersmith and Fulham, Harrow, Hillingdon, Hounslow, Kensington and Chelsea, Westminster.&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

A det\nailed analysis of the business case for collaboration and a business proposition for the creation of a public health procurement hub was produced, demonstrating potential efficiency savings. \n&#xa0;\nKey achievements in 2012/13&#xa0;•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDeveloped an agreed proposal for c\nollaborative procurement for public health services \n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCollaboration on the procurement of the GUM services from West London providers \n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDeveloped the basis of a commissioning programme to be delivered in 2013/14 onwards \n&#xa0;\nThe\n West London Alliance supports and facilitates a considerable amount of knowledge sharing and networking activity which\n \nsupport\ns\n council services\n in \n \nfuture \nplanning through the\n provision of \n intelligence, learning and benchmarking \nand \nprovides\n opportunities for joint \nprocurement \nactivities and collaboration\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nThe key officers groups which meet on a regular basis are the West London\n;\n Treasurers, Environment Directors, Planning Policy Officers, Regeneration Officers, Heads of Procurement,\n Proper\nty and Estates Managers,\n Leisure Officers and Information Managers.  \n&#xa0;\nThe WLA also facilitates two Improvement and Efficiency Network events each year. These bring together council officers to discuss common issues and challenges and share best practice.\n&#xa0;\nIn addition to networking within West London, the WLA has been contributing to and learning from the experience of other councils in London\n and beyond\n. Since 2011 it has chaired the London Collaborative Efficiency Network (LCEN) and the London Economic De\nvelopment Sub-Regions Group.  The latter discusses key issues affecting \nprocurement in \nLondon such as\n;\n employment, funding opportunities and wider strategic economic development issues. \n&#xa0;\nThe West London councils are represented on the London Procurement S\ntrategy Board by representatives from the Heads of Procurement and Treasurers Groups. They have been developing important linkages between the London-wide programme and the West London Procurement Board and Hub.  \n&#xa0;\nWLA observations specifically related to cross borough procurement projects&#xa0;Some points worthy of further exploration;\n              \nMost boroughs are very supportive of collaboration at the top level of the political and administrative \nstrata.  It makes sense after all to seek economies of scale and to reduce management overheads for both the contracting entities as well as the client organisations.\n&#xa0;\nPolitical realities however have to be recognised and taken into consideration.\nBoroughs\n will have their own individual Missions Statements, Visions and Policy Directives.  These will have been develop\ned\n from manifestos and electoral promises with a view to delivering to resident\ns\n outcomes that are politically desirable and that politicians \nare\n held accountable for.\n&#xa0;\nWhen viewed across a multi borough environment, aligning procurement activity that dovetails these absolutes into collective deliverables is \nchallenging\n.  There will always be borough specific imperatives from a local perspective\n that need to be understood.\n \nThat said, the common theme across all public sector bodies is the obligation to \noperate\n as efficient\nly\n as possible, to seek and to gain best value, and to drive out excess costs.\n&#xa0;\nIt is \narguably the job of procurement \nprofessi\nonals\n and their client organisations to make the economic case for collaboration. To do this they have to understand how such a case may be constructed and where derived benefits will flow from.  \nT\nhis goes beyond simply specifying a requirement and multipl\nying this up across a number of boroughs. It is more about understanding from a bidding \ncontractor’s\n perspective how they can\n be incentivised to\n reshape the way services are configured and delivered so that costs can be driven out and benefits delivered in\n parallel with enhancing the quality of the outcomes. These skills are and this knowledge is not always readily available in-house to boroughs. \n&#xa0;\nIt is often at this client / procurement level that collaborations become frustrated as there can be a disconn\nect between the high level political will and the ability of the departmental teams to\n; \na) \nbe able\n to \nsee\n the benefits of such and \nmake change \nhappen, \nb) be able to and objectively assess and \narticulate \nupwards \nthe benefits \nand \nrisks involved with making s\nuch changes\n.\n&#xa0;\nAs mentioned previously collaboration can be frustrated where it is not high enough on \nthe\n agenda to bring it to the forefront of peoples thinking and more importantly their future planning.\n \nMore often than not \nborough \nprocurers\n are content with satisfying the\nir\n immediate requirements, rather than planning for the future. They will often cite lack of resources, time or other priorities as matters that divert them from pursuing collaboration.\n&#xa0;\nAn underlying issue may be that collaboration threatens the status quo within an individual borough and individuals or the departments they work in may see it as portending the future and their control over it.   As with all change unless people can see th\neir role in the future they may well challenge it or seek to frustrate it.\n&#xa0;\nOther matters that can frustrate collaboration or procurement improvement can be;\n&#xa0;\n•\n              \nLack of vision / Apathy / Parochialism / Lack of confidence•              Organisational inadequacy / inadequate skill base to take on new challenges•              Limited capacity or confidence in dealing with a changed risk/ reward profile•              Mistrust of partners in other boroughs / Political alignment•              Fear of lack of control / individual budgeting / Poor understanding of risk•              High staff turnover / churn / overabundance of interim staff &#xa0;\nThese matters can be overcome through dialogue and working with colleagues to share a clear vision of the future from senior levels downwards, however this takes time and care\n. Peoples concerns need to be aired and valued and they need to know that they will be supported in any new initiative. \n&#xa0;\nStaff will need to recognise that the general direction of travel within the procurement fraternity is towards collaboration and that \nthey will be given support to up skill and embrace this on behalf, not only of their own employers, but also the wider regional public sector community.\n&#xa0;\nAs previously discussed, many \nlocal authority procurement staff were traditionally recruited on the basis that they were required to understand the corporate and European procurement rules and are able to ensure control over and compliance with these strictly controlled requirements.\n \nT\nhis offers up a level of protection for Authorities from challenges from aggrieved bidders and also from the EU commission itself from charges of non-compliance. Both of which can incur costly remedies if \na borough is \nfound to be at fault.\n&#xa0;\nThis being the\n case then the room for a\n more\n entrepreneurial approach to procurement is not only limited but could be viewed as being positively discouraged by more risk adverse boroughs.\n&#xa0;\nAs a norm then it could be suggested that the staff that populate procurement dep\nartments may not have the\n incentive\n,\n \naptitude or the proficiency to engage fully in what the private sector may classify as normal commercially lead behaviour\n. \nN\negotiation and deal making \nmay therefore \nnot be familiar territory for them.\n&#xa0;\nIt is relatively easy to hide behind process and restrictive rules to avoid being commercial driven, however without challenging the status quo and testing the art of the possible the ability to drive through change and make value driven deals will be frus\ntrated. \n&#xa0;\nTraining can be given to enhance commercial skills however instilling the confidence into individuals to plan for and to use these skill in a live procurement environment may be more of a problem if those staff are not naturally inclined to engag\ne in this activity or do not believe they were recruited to do so.\n&#xa0;4.              What Skills, Knowledge Training and Education are required?&#xa0;\nFor most borough \nstaff\n \nmulti\n borough collaborative\n procurement \nprojects\n are novel. They tend to be ‘first off’ \n/ \n‘one\n off’ e\nxercises for them.\n By necessity then \nthe WLA \ntraining focus is in this area.\n \nWhilst not wishing to make collaborative procurement training an industry in its own right, there is an opportunity and benefits to sharing best practice between boroughs and \nbetween London borough regions on this topic.\n&#xa0;\nTemplate and example documents are kept on the WLA knowledge portal\n -\n which is a\nlso a\n \nr\nepository for lessons learned material\n,\n \nFAQ’s, d\no\n’s\n \nand \ndon’ts\n, \ncase studies \nand links to best practice.\n \nAll material deve\nloped by our projects is recycled as learning material for others.\n \nWe also maintain an ‘experienced practitioner’ network to act as a touch stone for future projects\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nCollaborative Workshops (example)&#xa0;\nIn June 2013 the WLA ran a procurement workshop\n entitled \nListening, Learning and Improving. \nThis was c\nhaired by one of our Chief Executives and peopled with strategic directors, procurement and delivery staff, as well as Legal, IT, HR and other representatives. \n&#xa0;\nObjective; \nshar\ning\n experiences both goo\nd and bad and discuss\ning\n solutions to problems and how resolutions were achieved\n, \ntest\ning\n whether optimum solutions were found. Or how we could have done better?\n Thus b\nuilding up a network of \n‘people who can’ \nwithin our boroughs - such that they can be \ncalled on in the future to help, support and if necessary lead on future procurements\n. \nPeople who can \nare not necessarily procurement professionals.\n&#xa0;\nWe also run regular procurement \nlearning \nworkshop sessions for the WLA and other boroughs to attend. Each \nWorksop is themed and for each we invite guest speakers to discuss relevant procurement and supply issues.\n&#xa0;\nTopics covered to date have included;\n&#xa0;\n•              Green Deal / •              Eco / Fuel Poverty / London Living Wage / RE:FIT / RE:NEW•              Social Inclusion / Third Sector engagement•              SME / Cross River Partnership / Involving Local Suppliers•              Collaborative Procurement•              GPS initiatives - Contingent labour•              Digital Inclusion / Pan London roads and highways framework - GLA&#xa0;\nWe have also had in attendance at our workshops re\npresentatives from;\n \nnon WLA b\noroughs, London Councils, GLA, Central Government Departments, \ncontractors, \ntrade bodies, \nregional efficiency agencies specialist industry experts.\n&#xa0;\nWithin the WLA\n we have created a formal network of boards, network groups, directors, senior staff and operational staff - flowing down from the Chief Executives - who meet every 4 weeks. To ensure ownership of all matters related to procurement and other collaboration.\nSee attached chart.\n&#xa0;\nIn terms of procurement the focus of this activity is the Procurement Board.  Which is the governing body for the WLA head of procurement\n’\ns programme and to which the annual business plan is presented, debated and signed off.\n \nThis Bo\nard \nis \nchaired by the Chief Executive of Hounslow Council and it has wide membership across the WLA group of\n; Head of Legal Services (Brent\n), Director of Finance (Hillingdon), Me\nmbers (from Hounslow and Barnet\n), Treasurer (Kensington and Chelsea), Head of \nProcurement (Ealing), Director of Environment (Harrow) and the Director of the WLA.\n&#xa0;\nA\nll spend \ncategories \nare represented in the attached diagram\n, \neach hav\ning\n a board that look\ns\n for collaborat\niv\ne opportunities\n, \nbe that Property, Estates, Children’s \n/\n Adult\n services, Transport, Environment, Highways, Waste, Parking, Customer Services, etc. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWithin the WLA we operate a standardised \nBenefit Realisation \nprocess. The concept is aimed at making the link between the cost savings and the benefits identified and established in a business case and secured from a procurement competition, to that which Finance Directors within a borough recognise as being delive\nred on the ground. Thus closing the budgeting\n /\n \nprocurement \ncycle loop where historically there has been little or no correlation between the costs and benefits that \nare \nclaim\ned as\n resultant from a procurement activity\n.\n&#xa0;\nWhilst this requires extra work as \nit is a planned discipline within the procurement and finance departments of a borough \n–\n it\n is useful in that it helps\n in bringing credibility and corporate ownership to the savings claims.\n&#xa0;\nThe Benefits Realisation process if overseen by a Board made up o\nf the Finance Directors from all of the boroughs, and is  chaired by an independent Treasurer from outside of the immediate WLA group.\n&#xa0;\nFor further information see the WLA annual report 2012/13 \n&#xa0;\nhttp://www.westlondonalliance.org/WLA/wla.nsf/Publications/WPB-474/$file/WLA%20Annual%20Report%202012-13%20-%20Final.pdf\n&#xa0;\n"
