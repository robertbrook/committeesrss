&#xa0;
Declaration of interest:
This submission represents the 
sole 
view of Manlove Forensics Ltd, based in South Oxfordshire, near Wantage.  Our company is one of the smaller suppliers of forensic science services to the 
Criminal Justice System (CJS). 
Our company is entirely owned and run by its two founding directors.  We cover a wide range of evidence types but those that we provide to Police are mainly in relation to footwear and firearms evidence as well as a number of specialist ecological services.  Our staff are highly experienced and all our scientists have been working within the CJS since before the FSS closure.  We feel we are well placed to address the issues which you have requested a response.
