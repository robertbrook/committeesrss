defaultQ1 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Good afternoon and welcome.  Thank you very much for coming in to share your experiences of 
defaultBurma
default and your thoughts about where it might be heading.  As you know, the Committee is heading out there next week, and two of us have actually been out with the Speaker’s group in July.  We are looking at democracy and development, and the link between the two, given the way things have changed.  I just wondered, first of all, for the record, if you could introduce yourselves and your organisation.  
defaultShihab Uddin Ahamaddefault: My name is Shihab.  I am the Country Director from ActionAid 
defaultMyanmar
default, and I have been living in 
defaultMyanmar
default for the last seven years.
defaultBrian Wakleydefault: My name is Brian Wakley and I am the Chief Executive for Cord.
defaultTucker McCravydefault: My name is Tucker McCravy, and I am the Regional Programme Manager for Peacebuilding in the Cord Asia region.
defaultDan Collisondefault: I am Dan Collison.  I work for Save the Children.  I am the Head of Programme Support for Save the Children International in 
defaultLondon
default here, but I lived and worked in 
defaultMyanmar
default, in 
defaultBurma
default, between 2008 and 2011, originally managing the response to Cyclone Nargis.
defaultChris White:default Before we start, can I just, for the record, express an interest?  I had a relationship with Cord, having visited 
defaultChad
default with Cord before I became an MP.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ2 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default On the basis of what you said, we are perfectly relaxed, as far as I can see, about “
defaultBurma
default” and “
defaultMyanmar
default”.  They are becoming increasingly interchangeable, but we know there are some sensitivities there.  As I say, thank you for coming in.  We obviously see 
defaultBurma
default as being in a unique position, I suppose, after 50 years of being repressed, shut in and no development, top
default&#x2011;
defaultdown but opening up, which 
defaultpossibly offers 
defaultgreat potential for the people but also 
defaultcarries 
defaulta huge amount of risk.  Perhaps the thing to do really is to ask you to give us your thoughts at the moment.  What is your view?  Briefly, all of you, what is your take on the current situation?  How do you think it is going and what do you think are the key challenges?  If you are able to
default offer 
defaulta few key points 
defaultin answer 
defaultthat would be helpful.
defaultDan Collisondefault: You are right: it is a period of unprecedented and unforeseen change.  If I compare my experience when arriving in 
defaultMyanmar
default in 2008, there was a situation of fear and oppression that pervaded the country at the time, and things have changed dramatically.  There are lots and lots of reasons for that change, and we do not necessarily want to spend time exploring them now, although we could do, but there is good stuff happening, really profound change—the relaxation of censorship laws, the currency flotation, the tender of telecoms, the ceasefires.  For Save the Children, there is even what might seem like small stuff—the raising of the age of juveniles from 16 to 18.  There is lots of stuff going on; these changes are meaningful but fragile.  
defaultOne of the reasons for that is that the institutions in 
defaultMyanmar
default remain so weak—the parliament, the administration and the courts—and these changes are not necessarily being felt in people’s lives yet.  While you have big economic change happening at policy level, the everyday person is seeing massive hikes in electricity costs, food prices going up of course and the very serious inter
default&#x2011;
defaultcommunal anti
default&#x2011;
defaultMuslim violence that you have seen in recent months.  These are threats to stability, but it is fair to say that 
defaultin terms of 
defaultthe changes we have seen over the last two years, I do not know about anybody else, but very few people saw them coming, if anybody.  We think that, despite these threats, the changes are hopefully largely irreversible.
defaultTucker McCravydefault: Just to echo what my colleague has said, there are unprecedented opportunities right now in 
defaultMyanmar
default for building a peaceful and democratic society.  There are a number of concurrent change processes that are happening, which make it quite challenging for both the leadership of the country, as well as 
defaultthe 
defaultinternational donors and actors to engage in.  One 
defaultchange 
defaultis the move from an autocratic style of leadership to one that is more democratic
default;
default 
defaultanother 
defaultis the move from more state
default&#x2011;
defaultcontrolled and more closed economies to an open
default&#x2011;
defaultmarket economy.  The third one, which is something that greatly interests us, is the movement from an ethically or religiously divided society into one that embraces the principles of pluralism.  
defaultIf we had to name perhaps the greatest challenge, the recent religious violence, the recent spates of attacks against Muslims, represents the single greatest challenge to 
defaultMyanmar
default, because it could be the thread that unravels the entire ball of yarn, so to speak, in the democratic reform process.  With the international community in 
defaultMyanmar
default in the spotlight and the processes moving forward in a very positive way, this could be something that, if not directly and concisely addressed by the leadership, could undo a lot of the positive changes.  There is the larger question of what the role of the military is in either supporting or, in some 
defaultways, implicitly opposing these changes.  The larger processes of state
default&#x2011;
defaultbuilding and folding the democratic process towards democracy and development into the project of building a peaceful, sustainable and just society in Myanmar is the greatest challenge that we are facing right now.
defaultShihab Uddin Ahamaddefault: I fully endorse both my colleagues.  I want to add that, because of these 50 or 60 years, they never had a chance to understand what democracy is and what human rights are.  The understanding of democracy and human rights of the 
defaultMyanmar
default leaders and the people are very different from what we understand.  The people, the majority of wh
defaultom
default are Burmese, do not believe that other ethnic groups or people with different religious identities have the same rights.  A change in the Government is not enough.  Working on that is not enough.  That is what I see as the major challenge for development, bringing a culture of democracy and for peace.  
default              
defaultThe second challenge
default at the moment is that 
defaultalthough Burma’s Government is very keen, particularly at the leadership level, for reform, the real capacity within the Burmese Government and their leaders to take this 
defaultprocess 
defaultforward alone is probably not enough.  Then the question is how far the international community will intervene and engage without taking the leadership role and letting the
default Burmese Government 
defaultlead the process.  
defaultThe other one is the issue of economic development, particularly what kind of model of economic development we will propose and participate in with them.  That is probably one of the major issues at this moment.  
defaultThose are 
defaultthe main challenges.
defaultChair:default Thank you very much.  Obviously our Committee has a particular responsibility to look at DFID’s operation, its potential and its strategy, so we have a number of questions on that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ3 default&#xa0; 
defaultFiona Bruce:default Thank you very much for outlining the main challenges that you sense at the moment.  My question really is: which of these do you think DFID is particularly specialised to assist with?  We would like your comment on the statement that DFID has made that it has taken a “high cost, high risk but also high return” approach to 
defaultBurma
default.  Do you think this is the case and do you think it is the correct approach?
defaultShihab Uddin Ahamaddefault: The UK Government probably has the longest history of engagement with 
defaultBurma
default.  Even DFID’s team was pretty new when they started sometime in 2009 or 2010, but even the 
defaultBangkok
default team had very good engagement with the different actors.  Currently
default,
default probably the largest team of any donor is DFID.  They understand very well the DNA of the society, the pulse of the people and, at the same time, they are playing a leadership role at this moment with other donors, particularly since Cyclone Nargis.  I would say that DFID is in a good place to take the lead role in development.  That is their advantage.
default              
defaultAnother advantage I see is that DFID’s approach to engaging with development actors is 
defaultflexible 
defaultcompared 
defaultwith that of 
defaultmany other donors, most of whose aid is very tight.  DFID is flexible in terms of different approaches and interventions.  The third 
defaultadvantage 
defaultis the DFID’s team understanding and the way they engage with civil society.  That puts them in a very good place for international relations with local society and, at the same time, the political society.  They are quite engaged and they understand the political society and politics of 
defaultBurma
default.  
defaultTucker McCravydefault: I concur with my colleague.  DFID globally has significant expertise in state
default&#x2011;
defaultbuilding and, in particular, a very clear strategy 
defaulton
default building peaceful states and societies, which looks at a number of key areas that are germane to the situation in 
defaultMyanmar
default.  They are: 
defaulttrying to address the root causes of conflict; building in conflict resolution mechanisms; looking at how to contribute to sustainable political settlements; and also building capable, accountable and responsive governments.  That is a theme that has come up and will come up, again and again.  
defaultI agree with my colleague that DFID has a particular stature in the 
defaultMyanmar
default context, because it is one of the largest, if not the largest, bilateral donor and also because of its relations with the Government, both in terms of political society and civil society.  They are well placed both 
defaultto 
defaultengage with civil society to continue to develop civil society, 
defaultand 
defaultto strengthen government at the same time and, more importantly, to put those two development partners in dialogue with one another, because any sustainable democratic process or any sustainable process of resolution of grievances 
defaultwill 
defaultinvolve the need to bring both of those actors to the table.  Using their long experience in 
defaultMyanmar
default and using the global framework of their state
default&#x2011;
defaultbuilding strategy makes them very well placed to address a number of the challenges
default that we outlined in answer to 
defaultthe first question.  
defaultDan Collisondefault: Aid flows to 
defaultMyanmar
default are still relatively small, particularly in comparison 
defaultwith 
defaultsome of its neighbouring countries.  
defaultMyanmar
default receives about $10 per capita in aid support, which is about 20% of the aid on offer to 
defaultCambodia
default.  I am not saying that 
defaultCambodia
default is a great example because, as we were discussing on the way in, perhaps when we come to the later part of the question about “What next?” or, a generation on from now, how aid will look, I do not think that any of us would think that where Cambodia is at presents a very good model in terms of aid dependency.  
defaultThere are a lot of tempting opportunities for a donor like DFID now, during this period of change.  Do you focus on education, micro
default&#x2011;
defaultfinance, parliamentary reform or parliamentary support and capacity-building?  Aid flows might increase a bit, but perhaps not dramatically.  It is really the international financial institutions 
defaultsuch as 
defaultthe World Bank that are going to be big financiers of growth over the next few years.  Agencies like DFID can really play a strong role in influencing how those big IFIs go about their business in 
defaultMyanmar
default.
default              
defaultIn terms of what DFID might usefully focus on, and indeed has been 
defaultdoing 
defaultfor a number of years, on the one hand, there is clear need and opportunity to invest in the supply side of service provision.  The health service and the education services are at a very low ebb.  Whether it is investing in township
default&#x2011;
defaultlevel hardware, facility
default&#x2011;
defaultlevel support or what you could call the software—the training and capacity-building of teachers and community health workers—that is a big job that the international community can and does support.
default              
defaultThe other thing that we have not really mentioned yet is the incredibly high levels of rural poverty in 
defaultMyanmar
default, and what the aid effort and agencies like DFID can do to try to tackle some of that.  Per capita income, relative to its neighbours, is tiny.  Per capita income in 
defaultMyanmar
default is 6.3% of what it is in 
defaultThailand
default, so the discrepancies around the region are very stark.  
defaultOne thing that perhaps DFID could focus on, and has been 
defaultdoing 
defaultthrough its contributions to the Livelihoods multi
default&#x2011;
defaultdonor fund, which is LIFT as you know, is around access to financial services for the poorest, trying to break the very damaging cycles of debt and credit that characterise most people’s lives in rural Myanmar, where the landless poor do not have access to credit, rely very much on debt or mortgaging their labour to get them through the agricultural season.  The two need to go together; there is no point in increasing people’s incomes so that they can access services that are still so poor.  
defaultIn terms of the risk and return, I like what my colleagues have been saying; the investments in building civil society are a bit unknown.  They are potentially risky because you 
defaultdo not quite know what you are going to spark off, but that is where the really creative aid assistance can be made in 
defaultMyanmar
default over the next few years.  If we get on to it, we have some fabulous examples of how that can contribute, not only to development but also to democratisation, as people get active, get engaged and get information.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ4 default&#xa0; 
defaultHugh Bayley:default Let me just follow up to Dan Collison first.  We were in 
defaultPakistan
default not to
defaulto
default long ago and 
defaultwere 
defaulthorrified to see the impact that debt bondage has on people.  You were just talking about bonded labour.  In what 
defaultsectors 
defaultis this a particular problem?  Which NGOs and/or state development agencies have been trying to address these problems?
defaultDan Collisondefault: It is a problem for the landless poor.  It is also a problem for small producers, because financial services are so poorly developed, and access to credit, through even the rudimentary banking system, is either very difficult or lending rates are so very high.  It means, on the one hand, small producers cannot get credit to grow their businesses and, therefore, employ the masses of landless labourers.  The landless labourers, as I said, mortgage their labour for rice farming, fishing rights and that sort of thing ahead of time, and are constantly repaying that to their landowners.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ5 default&#xa0; 
defaultHugh Bayley:default Who are their champions, if you wanted to break that cycle of indebtedness?
defaultDan Collisondefault: In terms of the donor and aid community, the LIFT multi
default&#x2011;
defaultdonor fund, of which DFID is a major contributor, has been set up with an eye to trying to do something at scale about these problems of livelihoods and income poverty, predominantly in rural areas, but looking at rural areas in many of the ethnic minority areas as well.  There is good experience and lots to build on in two areas.  One is around improving access to micro
default&#x2011;
defaultfinance.  There has been very mixed experience with micro
default&#x2011;
defaultfinance in other parts of the world, but access to credit is so poor in 
defaultMyanmar
default at the moment that, where micro
default&#x2011;
defaultfinance has taken root, it is a very valued and valuable service.  Working out the details of how that is managed effectively and sustainably is a big challenge, but it is high on the agenda for the multi
default&#x2011;
defaultdonor LIFT consortium.
default              
defaultThe other one worth considering, which is more problematic in terms of sustainability, but very effective in terms of helping people to get a leg up out of poverty, are cash transfers, which are essentially social protection mechanisms.  They are costly but we have seen, even in the recovery from Cyclone Nargis that, given a bit of cash support, families can quickly either rebuild and/or enhance their productive assets, so that it actually does lift them further out of poverty.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ6 default&#xa0; 
defaultFiona O'Donnell:default Can I just quickly come in, Dan, and ask if anyone else has anything to add?  Could you say a bit about the impact of climate change on rural poverty, and what the capacity is in 
defaultBurma
default to tackle the effects?
defaultDan Collisondefault: I will have a go, just because clearly the country is prone to extreme climate events.  Nargis was one.  There were other strong cyclones afterwards.  Cyclone Giri destroyed parts of Rakhine state.  I do not have the science in front of me at all.  You might be able to have a go at that, 
defaultShihab, 
defaultseeing as you are on the ground.  
defaultShihab Uddin Ahamaddefault: I could bring or at least send a publication about the climate change impact.  I would be very happy to forward that to my colleagues.  It is very clear, in the article I was writing, that our focus on 
defaultBurma
default is more about the political issues, but the thing is we did not notice how much this country has been impacted by climate change.  The simple logic 
defaultis it is a neighbour country of 
defaultBangladesh
default.  If 
defaultBangladesh
default has that level of climate change impact, why not 
defaultMyanmar
default?  
defaultThe difference between the climate change impact in 
defaultBurma
default and 
defaultBangladesh
default is that, in 
defaultBangladesh
default, the main area of impact is the coastal belt but, in 
defaultBurma
default, it is the big three regions in the middle part, which are serially affected by drought.  If you look at the story of poverty that the UNDP research 
defaultreveals, 
defaulta huge concentration of food poverty is in the middle part of Burma—those three states—and 
defaultthat 
defaultis because of that drought.  
defaultWe had huge investment, although not many other NGOs gave investment to the middle part of Burma, because girls are being trafficked to the neighbouring countries to the border of China and Thailand, because there is no way they could manage their food, because they have no agricultural production and no water.  Children cannot go to school because they have to go three or four kilometres away just to collect drinking water.  This is 
defaultone aspect that we did not no
defaulttice much about Burma
default, but we 
defaulthave documented these things recently through our research and photographs, and we are requesting that partner organisations that do a lot of work on climate change should look at that research.  DFID could take a leading role here but, unfortunately, 
defaultaccording to 
defaultDFID’s operational strategy
default,
default they are not concentrating on climate change.
defaultChair:default We will discuss that with them, but obviously they will tend to say that they cannot do everything.  That is where Hugh Bayley’s question about co
default&#x2011;
defaultordination might be relevant, so back to Hugh.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ7 default&#xa0; 
defaultHugh Bayley:default The circumstances have changed rapidly in 
defaultBurma
default and now there are many, many donors rushing to respond to needs, so can you say something about how big a problem donor co
default&#x2011;
defaultordination is and whether there are things DFID could do to get better and more efficient use of resources, through better co
default&#x2011;
defaultordination?
defaultShihab Uddin Ahamaddefault: From my experience on the ground, I can tell that most of the aid agencies, for some unknown reason, do not like co
default&#x2011;
defaultordination.  They want to go their own way.  DFID is probably the only organisation, 
defaultalong 
defaultwith AusAID
default,
default that appreciates or participates in co
default&#x2011;
defaultordination.  
defaultChina
default, 
defaultJapan
default and 
defaultIndia
default are three donors that do not want to 
defaultattend 
defaultco
default&#x2011;
defaultordination meetings at all, but the European Union, DFID, AusAID, the Swiss Government, Swedish Government, Danish Government and Norwegian Government 
defaultopt for 
defaultco
default&#x2011;
defaultordination.  
defaultThis is very important, particularly in the current situation where we are expecting that many aid agencies will be able to engage with the Government, 
defaultbut to 
defaultengage with the Government we 
defaultparticularly 
defaultneed co
default&#x2011;
defaultordination.  Who is contributing 
defaultto 
defaultwhich part?  
defaultIn particular, to introduce 
defaulta strong accountability system, we need co
default&#x2011;
defaultordination, and I can see that DFID is in a very good position to co
default&#x2011;
defaultordinate that.
defaultTucker McCravydefault: I would like to broaden the question a little bit, and look at the question of aid effectiveness generally speaking, of which co
default&#x2011;
defaultordination is one part.  If you look at the Paris Principles and the Busan Principles, they look at things 
defaultsuch as 
defaulthow much aid matches the priorities of the host-country Government and how much ownership there is of the aid intervention that is taking place.  These are all considerations that are relevant to the 
defaultMyanmar
default context.  
defaultWhen we look at, for example, some of the ill effects of 
defaultthe 
defaultlack of co
default&#x2011;
defaultordination, some of the principles of “do no harm” with aid effectiveness apply.  If you have duplication of efforts or if you have, in some cases, aid in humanitarian situations which, by virtue of the particular group to which resources are being given, actually creates or engenders further conflict, then that 
defaultis 
defaultpart of the co
default&#x2011;
defaultordination question.  
defaultA
defaults my colleague has mentioned, 
defaultyou also have to consider 
defaultthe logistical ability of the Government to entertain so many donors that come in with requests or even international organisations that come in with requests for meetings or requests for scoping missions, or just general visits to the Government
default.  That leads to 
defaultwhat is called a problem with absorptive capacity.  There is simply no time for the Government to engage and effectively pass policy discussions, in planning and formulation, when they are entertaining so many people who are coming to offer their good will and good services.  
defaultThat seconds what my colleague was saying
default.  If 
defaultco
default&#x2011;
defaultordination is not properly done and if it does not harmonise with the needs of the host
default&#x2011;
defaultcountry Government, in a broader framework of effectiveness, then consideration of “do no harm” 
defaultprinciples 
defaultappl
defaulties.  That is a very i
defaultmportant 
defaultconsideration 
defaultas well.
defaultDan Collisondefault: The instruments of multi
default&#x2011;
defaultdonor funds do present quite a good means for co
default&#x2011;
defaultordination, and there were quite a number of them at work in Myanmar well: the Global Fund for HIV, TB and malaria; the one we have mentioned, LIFT, the Livelihoods donor fund; the three diseases or the 3MDG fund for health, which is quite new; and then the one that Save the Children is helping to implement, which is the Myanmar Education Consortium.  As I said, DFID has invested heavily in all of these.  
defaultThey 
defaultrepresent 
defaultgood co
default&#x2011;
defaultordination mechanisms
default, because t
defaulthey reduce transaction costs
default and they 
defaultgive a broad group of partners, donors and NGOs a common advocacy platform.  Rather than, as Tucker said, the Government being assailed by lots of different voices with well-meaning advice, they give a chance for the aid actors to co
default&#x2011;
defaultordinate and streamline their messaging and their approaches to government, based on the evidence of what is working.  Those can be a very good co
default&#x2011;
defaultordination mechanism.  
defaultAlthough s
defaultome of them are quite high
default&#x2011;
defaultcost to run
default, they 
defaultcertainly reduce transaction costs for the donors
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ8 default&#xa0; 
defaultChris White:default This is really for Save the Children.  I would be interested, perhaps not at this time, to understand your comments regarding micro
default&#x2011;
defaultfinance—countries where you think it has worked and countries where you think it has not worked.  Generally
default, 
defaultin the Committee’s experience, 
defaultin 
defaultthe countries where we 
defaulthave 
defaultsee
defaultn
default these very small projects
default, they 
defaulthave been quite successful, so it would be interesting to hear your views.  
defaultI am directing this question to you first
default, Dan,
default as you have argued that DFID should be doing more in terms of education in Burma
default, but anybody else who wants to, pick up
default.  Do you think it should be a higher priority, and do you think its contribution to the multi
default&#x2011;
defaultdonor education fund is sufficient?
defaultDan Collisondefault: I do think it should be a higher priority but, of course, that is a difficult thing to say when earlier I said DFID has to be realistic and prioritise.  There are so many things on the table that one could put one’s support behind.  
defaultMyanmar
default has a young population.  This is an opportunity to invest in the next generation, and well
default&#x2011;
defaulttargeted aid can make a difference to many different facets of education, not just basic education—that means government
default&#x2011;
defaultprovided education, which traditionally NGOs have had a difficult time getting 
defaultto grips with, because the Government has preferred to work with UNICEF on that front—but around formal monastic pre
default&#x2011;
defaultschool, and what we call ECCD: early-years childhood care and development.  There is very important investment in helping children get to grips with learning early on.  They can get to grips with learning in their mother tongue early on.  
defaultThis period of ceasefire reconciliation is 
defaultoffering 
defaulta whole new set of opportunities to think about curriculum development in 
defaultthe 
defaultmother tongue, and how you link the needs for children to learn in their mother tongue in early years with a necessity for a broad national curriculum in the national language.  The role that that can play in reconciliation and state
default&#x2011;
defaultbuilding is very powerful.  
defaultBased on our experience of working in education and working in DFID, you can get very good results working to support teachers to move away from very uninspiring rote
default&#x2011;
defaultlearning techniques and harsh discipline to more of what we call child
default&#x2011;
defaultcentred ways of teaching, whereby children are encouraged to ask questions and be critical thinkers.  That is a very powerful way of getting kids to question the world around them and provides a whole different outlook from what this current generation has been brought up with.  We think there is a
defaultn opportunity for
default very powerful investment there, and this can create a strong platform for reconciliation and nation-building.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ9 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default  In your submission, you made particular reference to the international community’s education programmes in the Karen regime.  Is that, first of all, only in that area?  They have not done it anywhere else.  You have said it has “increased the isolation of these populations”.
defaultDan Collisondefault: I am not so sure that that is entirely true
default, but 
defaultI can see why you would say that.  
defaultChair:default It is not me saying that.
defaultDan Collisondefault: I could see why one might say that.  I think there are probably rather different views on that.  If we are going to get on to the questions of supporting ethnic minority groups, I would rather pass the question over to Cord, because Tucker and Brian are much more focused on that, so perhaps th
defaultis
default is a good opportunity
default to ask them
default.  
defaultR
defaultegarding the multi
default&#x2011;
defaultdonor fund, one of the tremendous opportunities 
defaultpresented by the 
defaultMyanmar Education Consortium it 
defaultthat it 
defaulthas been deliberately designed to get resources into the hands of smaller local NGOs.  When we talk about high risk and high return, there are risks attached to giving funding to small, often institutionally not so well organised, local groups, but the returns can be very powerful.  I like that slightly risky strategy that DFID is pursuing in 
defaultMyanmar
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ10 default&#xa0; 
defaultChris White:default 
defaultOn 
defaulta detailed point, you mention that you are trying to educate the children in a more questioning way.  Do you have a model that that is based on or an experience where you have used that 
defaultmethod 
defaultin other countries, or is that a new development?  What success have you been having?
defaultDan Collisondefault: It is not so new.  Where Save the Children has worked in education in many parts of the world, a principal strategy has been 
defaultto 
defaultwork with teachers
default,
default and often teacher
default&#x2011;
defaulttraining institutions
default,
default to get teachers to teach in a different way, so that they do actually encourage children to interact and to ask questions.  We have seen that approach not just in 
defaultMyanmar
default, but in 
defaultPakistan
default, in 
defaultChina
default and in the 
defaultPhilippines
default, and it produces a much more interactive and interesting learning environment for children, and they therefore do better.
defaultChair:default The Committee did actually see that in action in 
defaultChina
default, before DFID closed the programme.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ11 default&#xa0; 
defaultFiona O'Donnell:default The Global Schools Partnership was another 
defaultexample of 
defaultwhere that kind of practice went on.  Gordon Brown has just returned from a trip to 
defaultMyanmar
default, so it will be interesting to hear what his views are.  I wanted to ask about monastic education and if you have concerns that children are being taught not to welcome and embrace people from ethnic minorities.
defaultShihab Uddin Ahamaddefault: Thank you for raising this issue.  In 
defaultMyanmar
default, we probably need to look at it a bit differently and not 
defaultjust 
defaultto look at education as 
defaultbeing 
defaultvery straightforward.  It is a very important sector in which to invest and engage but 
defaultMyanmar
default is a resource
default&#x2011;
defaultrich country.  If we could help the Government business so that th
defaulte
default country could move forward with economic development and so on, the Government should be able to invest in primary education.  Until they can do that, the international community, to me, should support primary education and the development of the primary education system instead of supporting the religious institution.  The religious institution, whether it is primary level or even higher level, do
defaultes
default not bring good results in the long run in any country.  
defaultThirty years ago, the international community supported madras
defaults
defaulta
defaulth
defaults and, from around the 1980s, gradually the international community started withdrawing that support.  We know what the result was in 
defaultBangladesh
default.  I am not sure whether supporting monastic education is a good strategy, particularly looking at 
defaultthe 
defaultcurrent fundamentalism
default.
default  Also, I believe that the international community should support more secular education, and secular education, particularly at the primary level, can come through the Government’s regular primary education system.  I see the strength of that system as more important, but there will be a time gap until the Government is prepared to deliver primary education for all.  Civil society organisations, and in particular secular organisations, should intervene.
defaultBrian Wakleydefault: Coming back to some of the points on critical thinking, learning and support for education, it is not just 
defaultan issue 
defaultat the primary and secondary
default&#x2011;
defaultschool level; one of the things we would support 
defaultkeenly in education is 
defaultprofessionals helping Governments and local governments, whether through secondments or even 
defaultby 
defaultbringing people over across countries to experience different ways of working.  Part of the critical-thinking approach helps people to ask questions.  In a state where there has been 50 years of control, and people are taught and learn to think in order to be safe and secure, the challenge, as things open up, is trying to encourage that critical reflection, that questioning, that imagining of a different state and of a different space.  
defaultOne of things that Cord has done with its partners in different countries is 
defaultto encourage 
defaultthis learning approach, where you get peer groups working together; you will 
defaultthen 
defaultget different sectors, whether it is government and civil society leaders, thinking about what leadership looks like and asking those questions of how we want things to be.  
default              
defaultAs part of that, on this question of education and the secular approach, I would possibly differ slightly from my colleague, in that there is a lot from a faith
default&#x2011;
defaultbased approach that is very strong
defaultly tied 
defaultwith people’s identity, history and where they are linked to.  
defaultOften, part
default of a threat that is 
defaultenvisaged 
defaultfrom international support is that it comes with a new set of values, principles 
defaultor secular ideas.  
defaultPeople 
defaultmay have some very strong shared values with local religious principles.  Part of critical thinking is helping to engage and share that dialogue and that question of space, and connect to what is good within the faith
default&#x2011;
defaultbased approach and different identities, rather than automatically sidelining what has been a very long history and identity for people.  If and when they reflect on that process, they will connect to it and it will help that change, because they will automatically know 
defaultabout 
defaultthat from their historical and cultural upbringing, whereas there is a whole load of implied new lessons and new learning when you bring
default in
default a secular or rights
default&#x2011;
defaultbased approach, which does not necessarily connect.  That part 
defaultof 
defaultcritical thinking can 
defaultbe delivered 
defaultthrough an education programme, but 
defaultit 
defaultalso needs to be 
defaultapplied 
defaultwhen you are working with local government or local partners as well, in helping that learning approach.
defaultTucker McCravydefault: 
defaultOn education, 
defaultI concur with what Brian is saying.  I think some of the approaches that could and should be taken, and that DFID could think about sponsoring, 
defaultrelate to 
defaultcivic education.  The notion of the work that our colleagues at Save the Children have been doing on more of a child
default&#x2011;
defaultcentred approach to learning—the critical thinking encouraging reflection—
defaultmeans that 
defaultultimately, aside from being a social good in and of itself, the spillover or the benefit is 
defaultthat 
defaultit creates citizens who are more able to ask questions, who are more able to challenge the authority of the local government, to engage with the authority of the local government or, in some sense, to ask themselves questions about what it means to be Burmese: “What are my civic rights?  What are my civic duties?”  Civic education sets the foundation or the groundwork for civic engagement and the idea that local communities can work with local government officials on issues that really matter, participating in decisions that affect their lives.
defaultAnother challenge to the democratic space opening up is that, in democracy, freedom of expression and freedom 
defaultto say 
defaultwhatever you want is accepted, and is openly touted as something, freedom of speech, which is good.  
defaultIn terms of 
defaultmonastic education
default, the issue 
defaultis not only formal education, but 
defaultthose 
defaultmovements that are spearheaded by ethno
default&#x2011;
defaultreligious national monks.  
defaultThe 
default969 Movement in 
defaultMyanmar
default promotes religious intolerance and says, “Muslims have no place in this country.  Buddhism is the religion of the state, so we need to actuate that in policy.”  There have been some moves by the President to nip that in the bud and say that is unacceptable in a society that is promoting pluralism and tolerance of values.  Th
defaultat
default is something we need to instil at every educational level, not only at the adult-learning level, but at the formal and informal education level.  
defaultWe have an opportunity and DFID has an opportunity to learn from the lessons of, for example, 
defaultSri Lanka
default, in looking at how peace education or civic education can be integrated into the curriculum.  In the case of the conflict there, the Sinhalese, the Tamils and the Muslims are really learning how to co
default&#x2011;
defaultexist, how to think of themselves all as not only just part of their ethnic groups or religious groups, but 
defaultas 
defaultpart of a larger identity.  
defaultThat is crucial now, 
defaultbecause it is a generational process.  The children who you are raising now will be the future leaders of the country.  If you are raising them with values of intolerance or 
defaulta 
defaultlack of ability to see their own role in civic engagement, in 30 years from now, you will see that those are the people who run the country. 
default              
defaultLinked to that is this question of 
defaultwhat 
defaultyou focus on 
defaultin 
defaulteducation.  Obviously it is very clear that you need to focus on basic education—primary and secondary education.  There is also a strong argument, and I think Save the Children is doing some work in this area, 
defaultfor 
defaultlooking at 
defaultthe capacity and expertise in 
defaulttertiary education in the universities, looking at the diaspora and the talent that exists abroad, the former political prisoners who were ousted during the rule of military dictatorship, and 
defaultat 
defaultwhat role and what capacity they have to 
defaultshape the 
defaultfuture 
defaultdevelopment of the country.  Sometimes when we think about education, we think, rightly so, about access to quality education at the primary level
default, but we should take 
defaulta broader view of it and think about civic education, peace education and education that may consider, for example, funding scholarships for bright Myanmar students to go aboard and study public policy, in England or the United States, and then 
defaultto 
defaultcome back and 
defaultact as 
defaultcontributing members of this reform policy.  
default              
defaultLastly, 
defaultwe should avoid the mistakes of 
defaultCambodia
default, where civil society has stepped in and has provided a large role as service providers of both education and health.  It has done that very well and is playing a really major role in service delivery, which arguably is the role of the state.  The more we do that, the more we empower civil society.  We have to be conscious and 
defaultaware 
defaultof the fact that we really need to be building the capacity of the state to deliver the goods of education or to be the duty bearers, in some sense, to their population.  If civil society is always fulfilling that role, it links to another one of the questions of the Committee, which is: will 
defaultMyanmar
default ever graduate from aid in a generation?  If the state is actually not being held accountable to fulfil some of those functions, the answer to the question becomes no.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ12 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I think you were about to come on to capacity building
default, Shihab
default.  I just wonder if I could test 
defaultthat 
defaultbit further
default,
default 
defaultbecause 
defaultI think ActionAid
default said in t
defaultheir submission something along the lines of, “For the international community to maximise their contribution, their support must be balanced—respecting the leadership of the Myanmar people and not imposing ideals from outside.”  If I may say so, the rest of your submission seemed to me to set out a lot of ActionAid ideals that you wish the people to adopt.  
defaultThe serious point is, if you are engaging as an international community, how sensitive do you have to be to the local culture and how provocative do you have to be to absolute values?  If you have excessive Burmese nationalism that treats non
default&#x2011;
defaultBurmese as second
default&#x2011;
defaultclass citizens, are we not entitled to say, “Look, if we are engaging with you as a society, that is not an acceptable view of citizenship”?  I am really just trying to test your view.  To what extent are you saying that we have to work with the culture?  To what extent are you saying
default, “Y
defaultou have decided you want to open up; you have decided you want to engage with the world
default”?
default  
defaultIt that when you 
defaulthave a serious discussion
default about 
defaultwhat kinds of values 
defaultpeople 
defaultwant to adopt and the extent to which 
defaultyou 
defaultcan work together to educate people—this is the point I am making—to understand citizenship, as well as how to read, write, count and do all the other things that education gives them
default?
defaultShihab Uddin Ahamaddefault: There are a lot of good parts
default to local culture, but there 
defaultare elements that affect people who do not necessarily buy the same ideas in the same society.  That culture needs to be challenged; sometimes that needs to be challenged boldly.  In 
defaultMyanmar
default, generally the culture is majority Burm
defaultese
default, which 
defaultstems f
defaultrom the religious teaching that tolerance should be very high.  Unfortunately, tolerance is higher 
defaultamong 
defaultthe ethnic groups, which are non
default&#x2011;
defaultBuddhist.  What I am saying is 
defaultthat there is 
defaultinherent good culture in all the different ethnic groups: the Burmese and non
default&#x2011;
defaultBurmese, the Christians, Muslims Buddhists, Hindus and all.  
defaultFor an international community, we should challenge that culture too.  Some cultures are fundamentals of a society, and normally those cultures are not bad.  
defaultHowever, over a period, and 
defaultbecause of a number of different dynamics, 
defaultsome cultures 
defaultbecome 
defaultsomething 
defaultthat is not necessarily the foundation of that particular ethnic group or religious group.  The culture of isolation of the Muslims 
defaultin 
defaultBurma
default stems from the fact that i
defaultt is not 
defaultonly 
defaultthe Burmese 
defaultwho 
defaultisolate them, but 
defaultthe 
defaultMuslims
default, 
defaultbecause of their own culture, 
defaultwho 
defaultisolate themselves.  They do not eat in Burmese houses, neither do they eat in Burmese restaurants.  When we generalise that Burmese isolate Muslims, we also need to look at some elements 
defaultwhich mean 
defaultthat 
defaultMuslims isolate themselves.  
defaultThe majority of 
defaultMuslims never go to Burmese high school
defaults, although there 
defaultare some who go.  These things need to be challenged and addressed.
default              
defaultThere are also some issues about why a Karen child would not be able to go to a Burmese high school.  It is not that they hate the Burmese—that is the Muslims’ case—but the Karen child cannot go because of language issues.  They need to be addressed.  Some of that culture, the top
default&#x2011;
defaultdown, is not inherent, but it is more 
defaultthat the 
defaultculture 
defaulthas changed 
defaultbecause of the long military history.  Some cultures are an imposed culture 
defaultand 
defaultthat can be addressed through b
defaultold 
defaultinterventions, as well as 
defaultthrough 
defaulta number of development interventions that should automatically eliminate those things.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ13 default&#xa0; 
defaultFiona O'Donnell:default The other thing I am conscious of is that we have not spoken at all about gender today, what the opportunities are for girls and women, and just how much DFID is focusing on that.  We will get to that another day.    I want in particular to ask Shihab about your concerns, or ActionAid’s concerns, about the fact that DFID does not deliver any of its aid in budget support, and 
defaultyour 
defaultexpress concerns that we are duplicating and creating extra layers, with too many people delivering the same services.  Is your view, then, that we should be investing more on developing capacity within the Government?  I would be interested to hear what others think about that.  Do you think the Burmese Government is capable at this stage?  I wonder how rigorous is, for example, the committee system and the public accounts committee.  It seems to be very difficult to get information in 
defaultBurma
default about how much they are spending on their military budget.  Would the safeguards be there?  Is 
defaultBurma
default ready yet for the 
defaultUK
default to be delivering budget support?
defaultShihab Uddin Ahamaddefault: As part of ActionAid, I personally work with and engage with almost every level of the Government—central level, regional level and local level.  Where I work I feel that, if some donor could support this process, particularly targeting the 2015 election, 
defaultthe 
defaultGovernment, particularly the current President Thein Sein, is very keen to engage with the international community.  Some of his Ministers are 
defaultalso keen, although 
defaultI cannot guarantee that everyone is.  
defaultAs an organisation, ActionAid is involved in a lot of work on transparency and accountability.  
defaultW
defaulte could invest some money at the local government level, which is detailed 
defaultin our submission, at 
defaultthe township level and at some regional government level—and 
defaultin that context, 
defaultI could see a link with bigger development and the issue of peace and conflict
default—but 
defaultin Myanmar, until the regional government is empowered enough to decide their spending and their development, ultimate peace probably will not come.  Out of 14 regions, seven are ethnic regions.  If the ethnic groups could see that they have the potential to have a federal system, 
defaulton 
defaultwhich we have a question later, and 
defaultthat 
defaultthe
defaulty could rule their 
defaultethnic regions 
defaultand manage their budget and revenue, 
defaultthey would see that, “Yes, we have something to do here.”  I would propose more empowered regional government through some budget support, so that they can decide their education programme, health programme and so on, with other infrastructure development programmes.  
defaultThere is one more important issue. 
defaultThis is a time when Government is quite open and giving access to civil society organisations.  I want to take this as an opportunity to bring up the issue of transparency and accountability, and build the mechanisms of transparency and accountability.  Government is talking about transparency and accountability, and talking about a clean government.  If we are working with social audit and these kinds of issues, 
defaultand 
defaultif there is some support from DFID to the Government, then DFID and the civil society working 
defaulttogether 
defaultwill have more legitimacy to ask about transparency and how much money the
default 
defaultGovernment
default are spending.  
defaultIf 
defaultDFID is giving 50
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion 
defaultto spend 
defaulton education or health
default,
default with that small support, we will be able to see what the total amount is and how it is being spent.  We want to test those waters.  That is why I would probably not propose taking risks 
defaultby providing that to the 
defaultcentral Government, but it is possible 
defaultto risk it 
defaultwith the regional and local governments.
defaultDan Collisondefault: I think that Shihab has proposed a very interesting way to go and, in fact, some of this is already happening.  A good example that we have already mentioned is the 3MDG health fund, which has been set up, including with support from DFID.  Part of it is designed to provide support to the township
default&#x2011;
defaultlevel health system.  That is an interesting thing to try out.  It is not entirely new, because other agencies have been getting resources to that level over recent years as well, but it allows for two things.  
defaultOne is it makes use of the trend towards decentralisation that are going on at the moment but, secondly, the right level of support into the right hands provides a very good platform and opportunity for surrounding other stakeholders, whether community groups or civil society groups, to have an idea about what those revenue flows are and to look for evidence of where the expenditure is.  It is much easier to do that at a township or local level than it is 
defaultwith 
defaulta central budget.  We might still be in a rather experimental phase, but the earlier point about risk versus return seems to be a really creative and much needed part of the investment of the aid portfolio that DFID is following.
defaultTucker McCravydefault: I would concur with the statements of my colleagues.  One of the philosophies that is very strong in Cord is that you do not give people responsibility and authority without giving them power and resources.  It is unfair of us to say, “Yes, we would like the state to deliver these functions.  Yes, we would like the regional governments to do better at service delivery,” without showing them that we have trust or confidence in their ability to do that, and actually giving them the resources, within very carefully regulated frameworks, to do that, because that is where the true capacity development comes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ14 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Would the central Burmese Government allow that or feel comfortable with it?
defaultFiona O'Donnell:default I am just thinking about the Scottish experience as well.
defaultChair:default It is a good question for us to take to DFID, but you cannot do it without the consent of the central Government.  
defaultTucker McCravydefault: Of course it has to be a dialogue.  I would say there are three parts to that model.  One is really looking at local governance and following the principle of subsidiarity, which is that power is most effectively exercised at the level where it is most effective and efficient.  Maybe that is the regional level; maybe that is even the township level.  It is not the same for every function.  It could be different for health as it is for education.  Maybe actually some functions are more effectively exercised at the central Government level, but it is looking at a tripartite model that might be strengthening the deconcentration and decentralisation forms, which put not only the power and the responsibility, but also the resources, in the hands of the local government and the sub
default&#x2011;
defaultnational actors.  It is also looking at civic engagement, which is what my colleagues have been talking about, giving people the opportunity to actually engage with Government and say, “Here is an issue.  We know that you have these resources; how can we work together to solve this issue?”
default              
defaultThe third part, and this is where DFID can play a critical role, is having policy dialogues at ministry level, with the central Government, in saying, “Really we want to help you in public administration reform
default,
default so that you can become more effective at the central level in your devolution exercise.
default”
default  It transcends.  There is a lot of talk about whether we should focus on supply
default&#x2011;
defaultside intervention or if we should focus on demand
default&#x2011;
defaultside interventions.  Using a social accountability framework that incorporates all of those and steps above that is actually more effective.  
defaultIf the international community is showing that we have confidence and trust, as Shihab says, it can really have dividends for the peace process.  It is modelling and setting an example for the international civil society community, which in some ways is the INGO community, which is showing they have trust in the Government.  That has flow
default&#x2011;
defaultover effects and modelling effects for how the Government works or interacts with its local civil society, which is also challenging.  We are setting the standard and saying, “This is really how we would like things to be”, and that is something that can serve as an example for how they then interact with their local civil society.
default&#xa0;defaultQ15 default&#xa0; 
defaultFiona O'Donnell:default In terms of building peace, you think of the Sri Lankan example as well.  There was an opportunity there to move, devolve and build a lasting peace.  As you said, it has gone in the opposite direction and is starting to go back centrally and be more repressive.
defaultTucker McCravydefault: It is an excellent example, because that is a possibility for 
defaultBurma
default.
defaultFiona O'Donnell:default That was the hope there as well, was it not, that we were going to start devolving power?
defaultTucker McCravydefault: 
defaultG
defaultiven the still
default&#x2011;
defaultentrenched power of the military for 
defaultMyanmar
default, there is a real possibility
default that things could start going in rewind or reverse
default.
defaultChair:default It relates to the next question, which is these ethnic conflicts.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ16 default&#xa0; 
defaultFiona Bruce:default Just before I ask about ethnic and religious conflict, can I just go back to the point about federalism?  Clearly for those of us who visited earlier, there is a desire amongst those living certainly in the regions for greater federal government.  What skills do you think would be required on the part of the aid agencies to assist the central Government to appreciate the benefits of that and 
defaultthe delivery 
defaultof a different kind of structure?  Do you think DFID has the capacity within its present expertise?
defaultShihab Uddin Ahamaddefault: Most of the people believe that federalism is the answer.
defaultFiona Bruce:default Yes, we heard this many times.
defaultShihab Uddin Ahamaddefault: Even the 
defaultS
defaultpeaker Shwe Mann, just a few weeks ago, was publicly talking about that.  He wants to promote this federalism.  I have less belief in him anyway.  The thing is, if we look at the population percentage of Burmese versus other, it is 60
default:
default40.  We will know the real percentage after the census next year.  
defaultFederalism is 
defaultthe model way 
defaultby which 
defaultethnic people may be able to see that they have space in this country.  
defaultIn terms of the capacity of DFID, 
defaultit should be engaging 
defaultwith 
defaultP
defaultarliament, which 
defaultmeans 
default the lawmakers.  
defaultOf them, 
default750 
defaultM
defaultembers all are in the 
defaultP
defaultarliament for the first time, including President Thein Sein and Daw Suu Kyi.  Most 
defaultP
defaultarliament 
defaultM
defaultembers have no clue what their 
defaultrole is
default, so there 
defaultis a huge need for capacity development
default, and to empower 
defaultin particular ethnic parliament
defaultary
default 
defaultM
defaultembers.  That could be one of the entry points for DFID to build capacity, as well as promoting this federalism.  DFID could 
defaultalso 
defaultpromote this idea of federalism
default through budget support that empowers the regional government and the regional parliament
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ17 default&#xa0; 
defaultFiona Bruce:default 
defaultOn 
defaultreligious and ethnic conflict, Mr McCravy, you said, “The single greatest challenge to future stability is religious conflict”.  Mr Ahamad, you talked about how, within the ethnic divisions, there really is a human rights perception problem.  I want to ask you if you feel that DFID has prioritised these issues sufficiently strongly.  Do you think they have the capacity to take a lead role in addressing these very serious and key issues?  What should be done by DFID to address them?
defaultTucker McCravydefault: DFID is particularly well placed, because of its global expertise in state
default&#x2011;
defaultbuilding in post
default&#x2011;
defaultconflict environments such as 
defaultMyanmar
default, to do more in the area of peacebuilding.  This is a very challenging process, because going back to the question of whether we impose external agendas or whether we set the standards for how things happen in 
defaultBurma
default is a very tricky question.  Really what we are looking at is helping the leadership of the Myanmar Government to realise that they have taken a journey towards trying to build a more inclusive and a more democratic society, which has certain expectations associated with it.  The international community has expectations associated with this movement in Burma to be more inclusive, to work more towards democratic processes or socio
default-
defaulteconomic development that embraces all people, and to work more towards political solutions, which not only represent the interests of all ethnic and minority groups, but also—and this is a key point—address the drivers of conflict or address the historical grievances of those groups.  
defaultTo go back to the federalism question, decentralisation and deconcentration are very important.  Whatever that model ends us looking like for Myanmar, it is not something that can be imposed externally; it is something that DFID and other international actors can facilitate, but in a neutral sense, and facilitate on the ground that these are the principles of what we are trying to look towards: the principles of devolution, the principles of power moving towards the local level, and the principles of representing interest groups.  If it is a federalist model and that is what 
defaultMyanmar
default wants, that is great.  DFID can stand in as a facilitator, bringing civil society and bringing government together, and contributing technical expertise and resources to make that happen but, at the same time, not imposing that as an agenda.  
defaultWhen we think about peacebuilding, it goes to the question about whether we should be doing democracy over development, or can we do both at the same time?  I do think that DFID is well placed to use the global state
default&#x2011;
defaultbuilding strategy that they have to build more responsive state institutions, but also to look at democracy as not only an end of itself, but as the principle of participation, the principle of expression and the principle of freedom of individual access to information, and also to look at socio
default-
defaulteconomic development and democratic principles as something that fit within the larger framework of the state
default&#x2011;
defaultbuilding process, the ultimate end of which is a more just, peaceful and inclusive society for all.  
defaultYes, I do think that DFID has the technical expertise
default globally
default.  They also have a mandate to do it and the acceptance by the local government and the other INGO communities to step up and to play a more active role in civic education, engaging the Government and providing good offices around settlements for the peace processes, but also expanding this idea that it is 
defaultmore than just the peace processes and the ceasefire agreements with the ethnic armed groups on the borders.  
defaultIt is more about engaging the entire community and, in particular, most importantly, the majority community.  If you go to the centre and interview an ethnic civil society or individual, and you ask them, “Is there a conflict in the country?  Is the country at peace?” they will say, “It is fine, no problem.  Everything is okay,” because it does not touch them on a day-to-day basis.  It is making them see that the future of the country is actually wrapped up in what happens with these ceasefire agreements with the ethnic armed groups, and more largely speaking in the process of how you build a more inclusive body politic that includes those groups and includes the majority together in a democratic framework that really respects the rights of all individuals.  That is a long
default&#x2011;
defaultterm process, but DFID is well placed to support it.
defaultShihab Uddin Ahamaddefault: 
defaultI do no think that t
defaulthe peace process and peacebuilding in 
defaultMyanmar
default are only about some peace dialogues or conferences.  They need to address the structural cause.  In this current situation, 
defaultthere are a 
defaultlot of possibilities for supporting that through institutional arrangements: how we help the reform of these democratic institutions and particularly the political institutions’ electoral process, which will ensure the equal participation of all the minorities.  
defaultIt is e
defaultspecially 
defaultimportant to consider 
defaultone thing
default:
default the whole mindset of Burmese leaders, including Daw Suu Kyi, is the Burmanisation of Myanmar.  
defaultWhile 
defaultthis mindset remains, I do not think that peace will be sustained.  It is Burmanisation of economic development, 
defaultthe 
defaultBurmanisation of the education system, 
defaultthe 
defaultBurmanisation of cultural integration and of political powers.  
defaultJust one example—and I am not sure that what I am going to say is politically correct; forgive me for that, but I am not a politician—is the relationship between DFID or UK Government with Daw Suu Kyi.  Encourage her 
defaultto think 
defaultthat, in the next election, she could build an alliance with the minority or regional political parties.  Currently the tendency and the whole discussion, as far as I understand, is that she is going to run alone with her political party NLD, but if she worked with the current regional parties—the Kachin regional party, the Rakhine regional party and other regional parties—that definitely 
defaultwould 
defaultgive an indication to those parties that they are an alliance.  If not, what is the difference between USDP and NLD?  USDP wants to run the election alone.  It is not just giving access to a few ethnic people in NLD.  That is probably not the answer.  
defaultChair:default She was visiting 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default last week to get some understanding of how the peace process has worked there.  We shall see whether or not she has taken any lessons from that.  It is not perfect, but it has produced working arrangements.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ18 default&#xa0; 
defaultFiona O'Donnell:default 
defaultCan we 
defaultbuild that lasting peace and that inclusive society if you do not go through a process, as they did in 
defaultSouth Africa
default?
default  
defaultSri Lanka
default has turned its back on that process, particularly with the issue of sexual violence against women in the conflict.  Women are being denied access to legal aid.  Soldiers are not being tried in the civil courts.  Can you build that lasting peace?  Also, in terms of what is happening just now with the refugee camps, there are problems, I understand, with the movement of aid and restricting aid into the camps.  Rationing is being cut.  Does that not leave us questioning whether or not the Government really wants to build this new 
defaultBurma
default, where there is a lasting peace and 
defaultwhich 
defaultis inclusive?  
defaultTucker McCravydefault: I have two quick comments.  There are two levels of engagement that DFID could take and any international actor could take.  One is looking at the humanitarian situations, the refugee camps, as you mentioned, and looking at how we engage, for example through the Business Innovation Facility that DFID has, and how we engage with FDI—foreign direct investment—regional companies and international companies, and how we really are firm on the principles of “do no harm”, to come back to 
defaultthat. 
defaultThere is a very real danger
default, i
defaultn fact, it is happening right now in Myanmar in some of the refugee camps in areas along the border, in many places, 
defaultthat 
defaultthe aid that is being given is actually making the conflict situation worse.  
defaultAs a very bare minimum, what we could be looking at is saying, “We want to adopt and respect the principles of ‘do no harm’ in our aid work.  What does that look like in terms of integrating frameworks of programme monitoring, building capacity, so forth and so on, as an immediate first bar?”  For the longer
default&#x2011;
defaultterm activities, once we have done that, how do we then look at all the activities that are involved in transforming this conflict and building a more positive peace, which is a much more challenging activity and endeavour?  
defaultTo come back to what my colleague said, the dangers 
defaultof 
default seeing democracy as an end, rather than just a means to a more peaceful society, are manifold.  Historical examples show us that, sometimes when we create democracies, we initially create more conflict.  Democracy is sometimes the tyranny of the majority.  We should recognise that and see the democratic principles as something that are far more important and dear to us in the process of state
default&#x2011;
defaultbuilding for 
defaultMyanmar
default.
default              
defaultTo come back to something that you said about Aung San Suu Kyi, it is interesting that, I think, if I am not misquoting, in a 2012 visit to DFID here in the 
defaultUK
default, she suggested that aid should not be going to central Government because, if you give resources to the central Government, you only make them stronger.  This is something that we need to look at and examine 
defaultin 
defaultthe context of what you are saying, because this is the work her father had done and was famous for—bringing the ethnic groups together—so it is about how she 
defaultcould 
defaultand should be playing a more positive role in those endeavours.  
defaultChair:default Our programme is still in a state of flux, at the moment, but we are going to have an opportunity to speak to some of the ethnic leaders, Daw
default&#xa0;
defaultSuu herself and some of the other politicians, so we will have an opportunity to tease these things out a bit further and make judgments.  The only thing I can report is that, when I was there with the Speaker—Fiona Bruce was there—we met some of the ethnic minority groups and the basic argument about the Rohingya—and we heard this at the university—was that they are not Burmese.  They are not anybody else’s.  We had a very blunt exchange and said, “You will not get anywhere with that argument.  The international community will not accept that and the neighbours will not accept that.  They are your responsibility.”  That was a shock to them, so I suppose we had some value in having that conversation.   
default&#xa0;
defaultQ19 default&#xa0; 
defaultChris White:default My question is to Cord: your submission says that the extent of the Burmese Government’s engagement with civil society will be the key indicator of democratic economic development.  Can you explain this thought?
defaultTucker McCravydefault: The sense there is again the theme that I have been trying to emphasise in some of 
defaultmy
default remarks
default,
default and that is that, in both democratic and economic development, certainly in democratic development, instilling the principles of democracy, participatory decision
default 
defaultmaking and expression of voice is something that is ultimately the responsibility of 
defaultthe state.  It is ultimately also the role of civil society to hold the state accountable for having done that to make sure that people’s rights are being respected, to make sure that abuse of power is being held in check.  Obviously the Government itself has functions to play in that regard.  
defaultIn terms of 
defaultthe role of economic development, the extractive industries are perhaps what are being referred to here.  The Government is presently engaging in a lot of work around natural resource extraction, which DFID has also been supporting
default.
default  There is a lack of transparency around where those resources are going, around who is being able to access those and where those are being allocated.  Again in a watchdog function, that is the role that civil society might play in making sure that the Government is being held accountable 
defaultfor 
defaulthow those resources are being distributed.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ20 default&#xa0; 
defaultChris White:default Do you think it has developed sufficiently to be an effective watchdog?
defaultTucker McCravydefault: Do I think that civil society has?  It is interesting, because it is a two
default&#x2011;
defaultpart question: both are they developed sufficiently and does Government see that as their role?  Perhaps the answer to the first question is yes, but perhaps the answer to the second question is a tentative no.  In other words, if we look at examples like 
defaultCambodia
default, does the Government look at civil society and say, “Yes, we accept that one of their roles is to make sure that we are doing our job”?  In 
defaultCambodia
default, it is a tentative maybe and maybe a no.  I am not sure in 
defaultMyanmar
default whether the answer is yes.  It is probably maybe.  My colleagues can maybe do something with that.  
defaultDan Collisondefault: Civil society has existed in different forms in 
defaultMyanmar
default for many years, from the YMCA to farmers’ associations.  In about 2005, Save the Children established, with a number of other agencies, a consortium that we called Paung Ku.  It means “bridge”.  It was designed to be a networking body for bringing and strengthening nascent civil society organisations in 
defaultMyanmar
default at that time.  It was very secretive.  We could barely refer to the project by name, and we used codes over phone and email to build up the project because, as I said at the beginning, this was happening when there was essentially a climate of fear and secrecy.  
defaultThings have changed so dramatically.  Now Paung Ku, which was the project that we developed together, is on the verge of becoming an independent organisation and it supports a wide array of civil society organisations, from community
default&#x2011;
defaultbased service delivery to environmental activists, and everything in between, and provides a very valuable service on the coaching and mentoring of those organisations.  If you get a chance to engage with Paung
default&#xa0;
defaultKu when you are there and the very inspirational man who runs the show, he would give you some fantastic insights into the development of civil society and what it can do, as your question led, to promote the process of democratisation that is underway.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ21 default&#xa0; 
defaultChris White:default Do you think there is an appetite for citizens to join these bodies?
defaultDan Collisondefault: I do.  Look at the take
default&#x2011;
defaultup of new media now that censorship laws have been reduced and there is a lot more information out and about.  There is an incredible appetite for information and for debate.  How quickly that translates into a much more vigorous challenging of authority may be a bit hard to judge, because I guess it is still at a rather early stage, but certainly this has unleashed a whole new level of energy around what you could call 
defaultcitizen engagement.  There is absolutely no doubt about it.  Investing in the support of that is going to be a very powerful support to what is going on.
defaultTucker McCravydefault: As a brief follow
default&#x2011;
defaultup, also investing in support of the Government and dialogue and awareness
default&#x2011;
defaultraising of the Government is not a bad thing.  As civil society grows stronger, they will be allowing the citizens to demand more accountability of the Government and not see that as an adversarial relationship.  Again that is what we have in 
defaultCambodia
default; we have a very strong conflict dynamic, where the Government does not understand civil society or local NGOs.  Local NGOs look at the Government as corrupt, the people who are driving the country off the edge of the cliff.  This is really what is preventing 
defaultCambodia
default from achieving a sustainable peace.  
defaultIt is a lesson learned from the region: as civil society becomes stronger, as freedom of access to information becomes stronger, as people really demand that their rights be held accountable, DFID and other international actors need to be working with the Government to show them this is how it functions in a functioning democracy.  This is how it is.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ22 default&#xa0; 
defaultChris White:default You mentioned new media.  What access is there to new media?
defaultDan Collisondefault: I would like to give an example.  It goes back to the earlier point about supporting tertiary education.  I do not know if you ever got the chance to go to any of the universities in 
defaultMyanmar
default, many of which, for a variety of reasons, were spread out to remote parts of the country.  They are really empty shells.  There is not much going on, let alone access to computers and technology.  Even books and teachers are in pretty short supply.  
defaultHaving said that, from a very low base, access to the internet and online education is increasing rapidly.  It is also increasing in universities.  I just want to bring to the Committee’s attention a very interesting initiative run by the University of Manchester to provide online learning and academic resources to universities in Myanmar, both using low
default&#x2011;
defaultbandwidth internet access, but also providing hard drives of massive amounts of learning information from MIT and all of the incredible learning resources that exist these days, which universities have provided.  It is a combination of that kind of academic support, but also the fact that the restrictions that existed on the internet and access to information have pretty much evaporated.  While mobile phone coverage is still pretty low, it is the big frontier for this in 
defaults
defaultouth
default-
defaulteast 
defaultAsia
default—the remaining one, really.  That will happen quickly.  
defaultShihab Uddin Ahamaddefault: My understanding of the civil society that I have been engaging with since 2006 is that, in 
defaultBurma
default, civil society is highly biased.  They are politically biased, religiously biased and ethnically biased.  When you try to engage with them, since their history is that civil society was not much encouraged by the Government, you only have one way to work: with the religious institutions.  Many are from the church.  It is difficult to encourage church
default&#x2011;
defaultbased civil societies, NGOs, to work for Burmese people.  In a village, if there are 80 families, 50 of which are Christian and 30 are Burmese, they do not address these 30 families.  It is the same for the Burmese.  
defaultI would also say that it is ethnically biased.  There is a Kachin civil society, Karen civil society and Burmese civil society.  They are also politically biased.  A civil society is fully leaning towards NLD, and another civil society is fully leaning to the Government.  That is the character, and we have to accept it.  We have to accept that this problem is there, then we will be able to solve it.  That is why I want to raise it here.  Unfortunately, all the presenters here 
defaultare men and probably that is why you noticed—a couple of times you raised the issue of women’s rights and sexual violence.
defaultChair:default We did notice when you came in and sat down.
defaultShihab Uddin Ahamaddefault: Since you are going there, I would strongly recommend that you please talk to the Gender Equality Network.  This is the most incredible network run by very powerful women, and they are doing amazing work.  They did plenty of research in the last two years, and it was evident that there is a huge issue of violence against women—huge.  Sometimes, when you go to 
defaultBurma
default, you see women in the street; they are very confident, they talk confidently and they walk confidently, but the undercurrent of society is huge.  The main problem there is, in a case where a woman of the village has been raped, there is no institution to take care of her.  The legal system will not help them at all.  The state always takes the side of the perpetrator, because the perpetrator offers money.  Those people who actually do the violence have power or connections with power.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ23 default&#xa0; 
defaultHugh Bayley:default It is important to work with civil society to help develop their capacity, but it seems to me that more should be done, and in particular the 
defaultUK
default should do more, to help to strengthen the institution of parliament.  Do you agree?  I can see you nodding; it is clear you do.  I just note from this submission we received from DFID that, in the past two years, some £3.5
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion has gone into civil society strengthening.  Nothing at all has been spent, according to this table, on parliamentary strengthening.  This year, £100,000—that is to say one 26
defaultth
default of what they spent on civil society strengthening—would be spent on parliamentary strengthening.  It gets rather better next year, I have to say.  Even so, you would be talking about spending £1
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion after £60
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion in the country as a whole.  
defaultWhat do you think needs to be done—that is the first question—to make these elected institutions, especially after the elections, more able to express the voice of the people?  How do you think that donors in general might aid that?  Can you see any particular role that DFID could play or the 
defaultUK
default could play?
defaultShihab Uddin Ahamaddefault: I 
defaultmentioned 
defaultthe importance of engaging with 
defaultP
defaultarliament and the electoral process.  This is the right time.  I will just tell you what the situation is
default like: t
defaulthe opposition 
defaultC
defaulthief 
defaultW
defaulthip came to me, and he said that he has no knowledge of what his role is
default;
default  
defaultn
defaulteither do his party really know what exactly is the use of th
defaultat
default 
defaultC
defaulthief 
defaultW
defaulthip.  That is quite obvious, because this is the first time
default there has been one
default.  
defaultTaking advantage of the forthcoming election, we probably need to start engaging with the people who are already in 
defaultP
defaultarliament but, at the same time, offer training or skill
default&#x2011;
defaultbuilding to people who are interested in being elected or participating in the election.  One thing ActionAid, with the support of the FCO, has been doing for the last four years, is investing in providing training 
defaultfor 
defaultpolitical party members, 
defaultbut 
defaultonly women, to increase women’s leadership.  Fortunately in the last election, two of them became 
defaultM
defaultembers of 
defaultP
defaultarliament.  
default              
defaultThe Parliament consists of two Houses, the 
defaultPyithu Hluttaw and the Amyotha Hluttaw, but 
defaultthose institutions also exist at 
defaultregional level
default, but n
defaultobody is actually working with them and helping them
default.
default 
defaultI
defaultn the regions
default,
default the chief 
defaultM
defaultinister is nominated by the Government, 
defaultand 
defaultwhatever he say
defaults
default is the rule; it is not the 
defaultvoice of 
defaultlawmakers.  
defaultDFID could 
defaultintervene
default in that situation
default.
defaultAs a
default particular intervention, 
defaultDFID could help to develop 
defaultthe role of the different lawmakers
default and help them to debate and address the issues. S
defaultpecial focus could be 
defaultplaced on their 
defaultrole to approve the budget.  We are 
defaultcurrently 
defaultworking with parliament
defaultary
default 
defaultM
defaultembers on these 
defaultbudget issues, 
defaultbecause 
defaultthis is the first time the Government has supplied the budget—
defaultall 
default42
default&#xa0;
defaultkilos
default of it
default. I have personally 
defaultchecked 
defaultthe weight of the
default documentation and n
defaulto one could read that, have an idea of how to read it, or how to debate 
defaultit 
defaultor work on 
defaultit. 
default Although the newspapers and even the DFID papers appreciate that 
defaultP
defaultarliament discusses and debates the budget, actually there is no debate.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ24 default&#xa0; 
defaultHugh Bayley:default On that point specifically, at what point does the 
defaultP
defaultarliament vote on the budget, or has it voted on this budget, 
defaultwhich 
defaultit does not understand?  At what point does the 
defaultP
defaultarliament vote to approve or maybe it 
defaultgoes 
defaultthrough the motions of approving the budget?  Has this vote actually taken place or this discussion of the budget, if there is no vote, actually taken place in the 
defaultP
defaultarliament?  I am asking the question to discover whether we should be asking some of the number
default&#x2011;
defaultcrunching experts in our 
defaultP
defaultarliament, perhaps at the National Audit Office, to maybe write a paper about the budget to inform 
defaultM
defaultembers, or is it too late for this year?
defaultShihab Uddin Ahamaddefault: I think it is a good time, because the next budget debate will start from January or February.  At the end of March, they will approve the budget.  They use the same 
defaultformat 
defaultas the British Government.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ25 default&#xa0; 
defaultHugh Bayley:default When will the budget be submitted to parliament?
defaultShihab Uddin Ahamaddefault: They will submit
default it
default, according to last year’s experience, in mid
default&#x2011;
defaultFebruary, but they will have to submit the regional budgets by 31
default&#xa0;
defaultDecember.
defaultHugh Bayley:default You say you have been offering some advice.  You have been pressing for these matters to be—
defaultShihab Uddin Ahamaddefault: We have been doing 
defaultso 
defaultfor the last two years.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ26 default&#xa0; 
defaultHugh Bayley:default This is a side point, really.  We must ask questions of DFID about its overall commitment to parliamentary strengthening but, on this particular point, you have been working in this
default.
default  Would you like to send us a copy of last year’s budget?  
defaultShihab Uddin Ahamaddefault: We would be very happy to do that.
defaultHugh Bayley:default With a note of when you expect this year’s budget to be published, both the regional budget and the federal.
defaultShihab Uddin Ahamaddefault: For the regional budget, it is too late, because they are submitting 
defaultit 
defaulton 31
default&#xa0;
defaultDecember.
defaultHugh Bayley:default Let us concentrate on somewhere where we could make a difference.  If you were to send us that information, I cannot speak for the Chairman, but I would have thought it might make sense for us at least to have a look at it to understand the problem before we visit the country, and think about what our 
defaultP
defaultarliament might be able to do, or DFID might be able to do, to help to make this a more engaging and more real process, rather than a symbolic process.
defaultDan Collisondefault: Just as a supplementary on that, the interesting thing to look into around the budget is that the Government has undertaken a partial flotation of the kyat, the currency.  For many years, there was an official rate and there was a real rate.  The budget was built around the official rate, which meant there was an enormous gap, a huge black hole in the middle of the annual budget, which gave carte blanche for people to line their pockets.  The 
defaultflotation of the currency and the closing of that gap between those two rates, or the elimination of it, has meant that, for the first time, there is an opportunity for a bit more budget transparency.  This opportunity and what you are proposing, 
defaultto provide 
defaultsome of the expertise of the UK 
defaultP
defaultarliament to support budget analysis and understanding, 
defaultto teach 
defaultparliamentary procedure and all of those things, sounds like it would be a very valuable investment.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ27 default&#xa0; 
defaultHugh Bayley:default Here is our last question.  DFID has, on one level, a zero
default&#x2011;
defaultsum game.  It has allocated something like £60
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion of development assistance to 
defaultBurma
default.  This year it is spending next to nothing.  Next year it is proposing to spend £1
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion on parliamentary capacity building and we have identified what might be one priority.  Do you think it should be spending more than that, and possibly at the expense of some of the other governance programmes it has or indeed some of the other wider programmes?  What level of priority would you give to parliamentary strengthening against strengthening the government institutions at one extreme or civil society institutions at the other extreme?
defaultShihab Uddin Ahamaddefault: One particular area that I see has a multiple impact is the debate on the budget, understanding the budget and reading the budget, because that brings much broader transparency.  That debate will help the media and civil society pick up from there and then civil society will also be able to engage.  It is very difficult.  Even though we have talked to more than 20 economists, they have no idea about the budget.  This year the Government even published the budget.  
defaultI recommend that one priority should be to understand the budget. 
default  
defaultKnowledge about other parliamentary procedures, such as 
defaulthow to 
defaulttable 
defaultmotions and debate 
defaultthem, is also important. 
defaultWhat is their role and how will 
defaultMembers 
defaultunderstand that
default?
default  
defaultThirdly, Members should learn about the role of the 
defaultparliamentary standing committee
default.
default  At this moment, what has happened, from my discussions with different parliament
defaultary
default 
defaultM
defaultembers, is that the Government, particularly the Minister or the committee Chair—whoever—
defaulttables 
defaulttheir motions, but it is the military that actually has previous experience about those issues.  They take the lead role in discussions and decisions, and most parliament
defaultary M
defaultembers are simple persons who do not really know what to say on that, unless it is something that is very political, particularly th
defaulte
default issue of ethnic identity or some 
defaultother matter that 
defaultthey know very well.  They have no idea 
defaultabout 
defaultall the technical issues.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ28 default&#xa0; 
defaultFiona Bruce:default Could you also comment on the role of individual members of 
defaultP
defaultarliament as electoral representatives
default and 
defaultwhether they really have an appreciation of what that involves and understand the importance of communicating with their electorate?  We heard a number of times that there were no channels of communication.  This was from people they were representing but then, at the same time, we also heard from 
defaultM
defaultembers that they had almost no resources to run offices individually.  Could you comment on the assistance that may be required for constituency MPs?
defaultTucker McCravydefault: I was just writing down some notes on that
default, but I agree 
defaultwholeheartedly
default with my colleagues’ comments
default.  There is room for more support 
defaultfor
default the Parliament, as well as other elected officials in general.  Something that obtains here is that we need to strengthen both the institutions and the structures that we have been talking about—the processes and the procedures: how you pass the budget, how you deliberate in parliament, how you look at laws and things of this nature—
defaultand 
defaultthe skills and the capacity of individual MPs themselves.  By that, I mean that, if you look at 
defaultP
defaultarliament, you will see that many of the people who sit in 
defaultit 
defaultare former military members or come from authoritarian backgrounds, where they are used to just saying, “Okay, this is what I’ve decided.  I’m going to tell my constituents this is what I am doing.”  It is a very top
default&#x2011;
defaultdown
default,
default autocratic society, which has interesting linkages to the peacebuilding agenda as well.  You find that not only in government; you also find it in civil society as well.  Leadership and management tend to be very top
default&#x2011;
defaultdown, which is a little bit challenging when you are trying to move towards a more democratic and participatory environment.  
defaultSome of these skills around constituency-building, around communication, around representation, around engaging in dialogue with people at the community level—really understanding what the issues are, but also understanding how to be accountable and, on the other side, for civil society and local groups, how to hold their elected officials accountable—are the soft skills that are really critical for a wide range of elected officials, including 
defaultM
defaultembers of 
defaultP
defaultarliament, and including, in parentheses, civil society members themselves.  Across the board, these management and leadership models tend to be very vertical and authoritarian.  That is the third part of the equation: the institutions, structures and processes, but also the skills for the individuals themselves.  
defaultFiona Bruce:default At both national parliament level and also at the federal parliament level—our equivalent of councillors.
defaultTucker McCravydefault: Yes, precisely.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ29 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default That was extremely helpful.  We do have meetings with a number of MPs and other institutions to discuss what actually is happening, because both the 
defaultUK
default parliament and others are engaged, but it would be interesting to find out whether it is enough and what more could be done.  That is helpful.  
defaultPerhaps just a final point to which
default you
default, Dan, alluded right at the beginning.  DFID is saying that they see the international community’s engagement producing a “more stable, peaceful and prosperous country that respects the rights of its people … and is a respected member of the international community”.  That is their ambition; that is what their hope is.  It would therefore become graduated from aid within a generation.  Do you think that is realistic?  Do you think it can happen, or is there a danger that the reverse c
defaultould 
defaulthappen and that it 
defaultcould 
defaultbecome aid
default&#x2011;
defaultdependent?
defaultDan Collisondefault: I was trying to think what a generation away would look like, and I
default&#xa0;
defaultguess it is around 25 years.  That is quite a long time.  If 
defaultMyanmar
default is aid
default&#x2011;
defaultdependent after 25 years, those of us engaged in designing and delivering aid will have really failed.  We should have learned all of the lessons from what has happened in 
defaultCambodia
default and not subject 
defaultMyanmar
default to that sort of fate.  
defaultHaving said that, you need to think ahead and imagine whether or not the poorest members of society, the poorest people in 
defaultMyanmar
default, of which there are millions, will have made sufficient progress that they will be able to send their kids to school and access reasonable health services.  It is very hard to predict that.  I would say that, if we have supported the development of stronger state institutions, if we have made a contribution to strengthening household livelihoods such that, as we said earlier, there is better access to credit and people actually have some routes out of poverty, then an aid programme could look very different.  
defaultIn fact, we would hope it would look very different from what it looks like now.  There would not be these big multi
default&#x2011;
defaultdonor funds distributing large amounts of money through multiple actors.  There might perhaps be a much stronger role for local organisations to take on in aid assistance or funding from outside of the country.  As we said on the role of the large donors, the IFIs, the World Bank, etc, in funding development, DFID should really look to influence those to make sure that aid, as it unfolds in 
defaultMyanmar
default over the next few years, does count and support
defaults
default democratisation and development, rather than tend towards dependency.
default              
defaultIt is kind of an impossible question to answer, but you could envisage that, if things go well, we would not be sitting around the table talking about what sort of an aid programme DFID should be designing
default, but r
defaultather
default,
default it would look very different from what it does.  If things move slowly and if the rights and the protection of the poorest people 
defaultare
default not realised, I can still see there being an argument for continued support along these lines
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ30 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default They have plenty of resources and they are very close to two very big markets.
defaultDan Collisondefault: That is true but, at the same time, 
defaultMyanmar
default is about the same size population
default 
defaultwise as the 
defaultUK
default, but it has an economy the size of 
defaultBristol
default.  The opportunities are there with powerful economies surrounding
default it
default, but whether in 25 years it can grow its economy at sufficient rate to actually stand on its own is hard to say.
defaultShihab Uddin Ahamaddefault: It is a good ambition and I believe it is possible.  
defaultMyanmar
default has all the potential to graduate within the next 25 years to a middle
default&#x2011;
defaultincome country, but there are a few conditions there.  One is whether people will be able to solve conflicts and bring peace.  The other one is that we have to accept that 
defaultMyanmar
default, because of its location, has a huge geopolitical importance, and how that geopolitical context and dynamics will pull them back or push them and help them to move.  Conflict today, as history says, is not necessarily only because of ethnic difference.  
defaultGlobal wealth 
defaultalso has a big impact on the conflict today.
defaultBrian Wakleydefault: I would say that the economic growth that we can foresee in the next generation is definitely an opportunity.  Financially, the economy is going to grow.  The question becomes much more around how the tax regime works, how foreign direct investment actually goes in to supporting long
default&#x2011;
defaultterm sustainable development in country.  It is not from the aid budget, but from internal revenues.  
defaultIn terms of the biggest dangers, looking at the peacebuilding framework, a lot of the challenges are around how good governance is going to work, and how you include minorities and those on the edges of society, where the current conflict dynamics are.  
defaultIt is a question of whether we can 
defaulttackle those root causes and those social attitudes
default.  For some, the desire for 
defaulta federal government 
defaultis about w
defaultho is going to control power
default, and the ability to a
defaultbsorb much more economic power and decision
default 
defaultmaking, rather than the pluralist inclusive democratic process.  The answer 
defaultis that t
defaulthose sides of development, the softer skills, the inclusiveness, the including of the other, and the acceptance and respect of others, 
defaultmust be 
defaulttackled, enabled and supported by the institutions and government structures
default. If not, 
defaultwe will be back in the same place where conflict has re
default&#x2011;
defaultignited and then undermined many of the developments that we may 
defaulthave 
defaultsee
defaultn
default.
defaultTucker McCravydefault: There are a lot of “ifs” here, as my colleagues, with whom I concur, have 
defaultsaid—i
defaultf there can be relatively free and fair elections in 2015, if an inclusive political settlement to some of the ethnic conflicts can be reached, if the Government is successful in 
defaultattracting foreign direct investment, diversifying their economy, building the infrastructure, so forth and so on
default.
default  
defaultDFID can play a role in leading this strategy for the development of 
defaultMyanmar
default along the lines of a state
default&#x2011;
defaultbuilding activity, which looks at building a peaceful, just and inclusive society, but also looks at that being something that is wholly owned and really driven, in many ways, by the 
defaultMyanmar
default people themselves
default. If that is the overriding concern and principle, 
defaultthen
default, for me,
default the answer to graduating from aid

defaultwould actually be yes.  
defaultIt also depends on starting now, doing some of the conceptualising and having some of the dialogue between the donors and the Myanmar Government, and saying, “Okay, in five years what does the situation look like with this roadmap?  In 10 years, what does it look like?  In fifteen years, what does it look like?”  You do not just go from one year to the next and cut off aid.  There is a gradual process.  Maybe “weaning” is a good way to describe it.  
defaultThis is where the lessons learned from

defaultChair:default That is an exciting challenge and an unbreakable one, but one that the Committee is looking forward to getting to grips with.  One of the consequences, I have to say to the Committee, of going away on a visit is that meetings bunch up, so we have two tomorrow: one at 10.45 with the Secretary of State and an informal meeting with the Burma Campaign people tomorrow afternoon.

default I thank all of you?  I think we may well be meeting some of your counterparts when we are in the country.  You have given us some really helpful insight and indeed a focus for some of the questions that we can engage on with both DFID and the other partners we see, and make some judgments.  Thank you very much indeed for both the written evidence you have given and for coming in and answering our questions.
