"Written evidence submitted by the National Association for Youth Justice (NAYJ) (JRR 0003)                            &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nParties shall assure to the child who is capable of forming his or her own views the right to \nexpress those views freely in all matters affectin\ng the child, the views of the child being \ngiven due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child.\n              \n              \nFor this purpose the child shall in particular be provided the opportunity to be heard in any judicial and administrative proceedings \naffecting the child, either directly, or through a representative or appropriate body, in a manner consistent with the procedural rules of national law.\n&#xa0;\nWe also refer the Committee to \nBaroness Hale at paragraph 23 of \nZH (Tanzania) (FC) (Apellant) VSecretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 4 which \nstates,  'This is a binding obligation \nin international law, and the spirit, if not the precise language, has also been translated into our \nnational law.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n'Of course, the judicial review system is an important way to right wrongs, but it is not a      promotional tool for countless Left-wing ca\nmpaigners. So that is why we are publishing our       proposals for change. We will protect the parts of judicial review that are essential to justice,     but stop the abuse.\n \n              \n Britain cannot afford to allow a culture of Left-wing-dominated, single-issu\ne activism to hold \n \n              \n back our country from investing in infrastructure and\n new sources of energy and from\n  \n              \nbringing\n down the cost of our welfare state.\nWe need to make decisions quicker and respond to issues more quickly in what is a true\n global race.\n \nThe Left does not understand this, and believes that our society can do everything for\n  e\nveryone,\n a\nnd that \nthose who work hard to get on in life should pick up the tab.\n \nThey want more money for public services, but at the same time to be able to halt \nthe investments which can deliver the wealth that pays for those services.\nI\nn proposing these changes, I will no doubt be accused of killing justice and destroying Magna\n \n \nCarta\n. Although as the great old lady of British law is approaching her 800th birthd\nay, and the \n \njudicial review system is barely 40, I’m not sure that argument stacks up. But in proposing  these changes, I know we will be doing the right thing for Britain.' \n&#xa0;\nWhilst the Lord Chancellor’s comments may have been in some part specific to ju\ndicial reviews brought on environmental/plann\ning interests the NAYJ has\n concern that he expresses his  views in political terms with a heavy regard towards economical value for money. Judicial review is not political and certainly not a left-win\ng mechanism. It is a means of \nholding those who make and uphold the law to account\n and ensure the correct and just decisions are made, not just speedy ones\n. We sincerely hope that the\n Lord Chancellor regrets these \n comments in light of our submissions in o\nur response on behalf of the need for access to justice  on behalf of Britain’s children.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;“There is no principle more basic \nto our system of law than the mai\nntenance of the rule of law itself and the constitutional protection afforded by judicial review”\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n“\nThe proceedings have been brought by The Howard League for Penal Reform whose history and credentials need no introduction. It undoubtedly \nis, as it claims to be, the leading non-governmental organisation in this country concerned with penal issues and policy. Here I need only to note that in the last decade or so it has had a particular focus on children and young people in the criminal just\nice system.\n”\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n‘...judicial review provides a prompt and efficient remedy for many persons affected by government action in large numbers of cases, often of critical importance to them, which are conceded by public bodies at an early s\ntage, and at little cost either to the public body or the legal aid fund. By ensuring that officials are accountable to the law, judicial review provides a powerful corrective to poor decision making, the importance of which goes well beyond the relatively\n small number of cases which get near a court. We consider that the proposals in the Consultation Paper will undermine the accountability of public bodies to the detriment of society as a whole and the vulnerable in particular’\n.\n&#xa0;      The NAYJ fully agrees with this view and believes it encapsulates the negative impact this will \n      have on access to justice and erosion of human rights.\n&#xa0;Standing and third party interventions&#xa0;\n‘No application for judicial review shall be made unless the leave of the High Court has been obtained in accordance with rules of court; and the court shall n\not grant leave to make such an application unless it considers that the applicant has a sufficient interest\n in the matter to which the application relates.’\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“Given the serious nature of the issues raised concerning young and vulnerable individuals, it would seem strange that a reputable ch\narity such as the Claimant should not be entitled to come to court and raise the kind of issues raised.”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“The first stage test which is applied on application for leave [permission] will lead to a ref\nusal if the applicant has no interest whatsoever and is in truth no more than a meddlesome busybody. If, however, the application appears to be otherwise arguable and there is no other discretionary bar, such as dilatoriness on the part of the applicant, t\nhe applicant may expect to get leave to apply leaving the test of interest or standing to be reapplied as a matter of discretion on the hearing of the substantive application. At the second stage the strength of the applicant’s interest is one of the facto\nrs to be weighed in the balance.”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIn some contexts, it is appropriate to require an applicant for judicial review to demonstrate that he has a particular interest in the matter complained of: the type of interest which is relevant, and therefore required in order to have standing,\n will depend upon the particular context. In other situations, such as where the excess or misuse of power affects the public generally, insistence upon a particular interest could prevent the matter being brought before court, and that in turn might disab\nle the court from performing its function to protect the rule of law.”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“The claim itself is brought in the public interest with the benefit of public funding. It raises issues of real \nsubstance concerning the risk to transferees, and, although the claimant’s standing to bring it was at one time in issue, the point has not been pursued by the Secretary of State.”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“It would, in my view, be a grave lacuna in our system of public law if a pressure group … or even a single public-spirited taxpayer … were prevented \nby outdated technical rules [of \nstanding] from bringing the matter to the attention of the court t\no vindicate the rule of law and get the unlawful conduct stopped.”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCostsPaying for permission work in judicial review cases &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n‘The superficially attractive reason is that it will inhibit the making of long-shot or speculative claims at public \nexpense, but it is supported by no evidence, and the argument advanced in support of it – that the claimant’s lawyer “is in the best position to know the strength of their client’s case” – displays a depressing degree of ignorance about how judicial review\n works. More often than not, it is the defendant authority which holds most of the relevant cards, and in many cases it holds on to them for longer than it is supposed to, either because there is too little time for proper disclosure of documents or becaus\ne sitting tight affords the best hope that the claim will go away. The departmental calculation is that indigent claimants’ lawyers will be deterred from taking on all but sure-fire claims. In proposing that other claimants can be left to their own devices\n without injustice, the paper makes no attempt to confront the consequences: a plethora of claims made by litigants in person, clogging up the courts as judges try to discern arguable points in the chaos of paper, and costing public authorities large sums \nin irrecoverable costs as they attempt to respond to such claims.’\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“\nCutting the cost of legal aid deprives the very people who most need the protection of the courts of the ability to get legal advice and representation. That is true whether one reduces the types of claim which qualify for legal aid or increases\n the stringency of the requirements of eligibility for legal aid. The recent changes have done both. If a person with a potential claim cannot get legal aid, there are two possible consequences. The first is that the claim is dropped: that is a rank denial\n of justice and a blot on the rule of law. The second is that the claim is pursued, in which case it will be pursued inefficiently, and will take up much more of the court staffs’ time and of the judge’s time in and out of court. So that it means greater c\nosts for the court system, and delay for other litigants.\n”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n‘(\ni\n) The cause of the delays complained of is largely historic, thanks to the very recent removal of asylum and immigration cases from the Administrative Court to the Upper Tribunal, which the \njudges proposed in 2009. (ii) Cutting down time limits for JR applications may actually increase the work, due to rushed applications and many more requests for extensions of time. (iii) The cost-cutting proposals risk deterring a significant number of val\nid applications, and will save a pathetically small sum.’\n&#xa0;\nThe NAYJ endorses Lord Neuberger’s comments and would agree that these proposals are\nlikely to result in higher rather than lower costs.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“\nMore immediately, the consultation paper has nothing to say about public authorities which play the judicial review system at public expense... It\n would be straightforward to propose that a public body which unjustifiably resists the grant of permission in a viable case should pay the costs of doing so; but the consultation paper has nothing to say about this, or about penalising late disclosure, or\n about other ways of saving public funds.\n”\n&#xa0;\nArguably some of the successful reviews involving young people in the criminal justice system cited above were cases where the government’s opposition to the application was of this form. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n       matter of course \nrather than just in exceptional circumstances, t\nhe NAYJ be\nlieves this is a matter for the     \n       \ncourt to decide on each individual case. \n&#xa0;\nWasted Costs Orders  &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“Legal representatives will, of course, whether barristers or solicitors, advice clients of the perceived weakness of their case and of the risk of failure. But clients are free to reject advice and insist that cases be litigated. It is rarely if ever safe\n for a court to assume that a hopeless case is being litigated on the advice of the lawyers involved. They are there to present the case; it is (as Samuel Johnson unforgettably pointed out) for the judge and not the lawyers to judge it.” \n              \nGiven that, as \nnoted previously, the legal issues involved in representing children are \nfrequently more complex any increased threat of WCO might result in young people in trouble with the law finding it increasingly difficult to secure representation for judicial \nreview.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nProtective costs orders &#xa0;\nQuestion 26: What is your view on whether it is appropriate to stipulate that PCOs will not be available in any case where there is an individual or private interest regardless of whether there is a wider public interest\n?  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCosts arising from the involvement of third party interveners and non-parties &#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nImpact Assessment and Equalities Impacts &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nProcedural as opposed to substantive defects in decisions &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Public Sector Equality Duty and Judicial Review &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIn Conclusion&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n18 November 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
