[normal]Overview of the Situation[bold]For example
[normal],
[normal] on 12 August 2013, the Prime Minister, David Cameron, stated 
[normal]in the Telegraph
[normal] newspaper
[normal] 
[normal]that he thought fracking should receive public support
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]Furthe
[normal]rmore, HM Treasury in its report 
[normal]Investing on Britain’s Future 
[normal](Command 8669,June 2013) indicated that 
[normal]shale gas exploitation is important in relation to Britain’s future pro
[normal]s
[normal]perity and that the Government is likely to support the process, partly through 
[normal]a
[normal] target of 
[normal]the Environment Agency being able to issue permits by February 2014 within 1-2 weeks of receipt. 
[normal]The Legal and Regulatory Processes[bold](i)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]adequacy 
[normal]of the current legal regime.
[normal]Fracking is a controversial 
[normal]process
[normal] as far as the general public is concerned
[normal].  Consequently,
[normal] 
[normal]simpler, more streamlined 
[normal]and overt 
[normal]regulation could provide the public with the reassurances it needs and thus be welcomed by industry.  
[normal]There is no overall control of the process as a variety of public sector organisations
[normal] and regulators
[normal] are involved and/or consulted at various stages. 
[normal]The
[normal] regulatory process in Wales is complex, partly due to the fact that development of major energy projects is not a devolved function
[normal].  As a result,
[normal] licenses for
[normal] the 
[normal] exploration and development (Petroleum Exploration and Development Licences – PEDLs) of sh
[normal]ale gas resources are granted by the UK Government’s Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC).  
[normal]There are numerous pieces of legislation and regulation relevant to obtaining overall permission to explore and exploit shale gas resources
[normal].  These 
[normal]cover 
[normal]town and country planning; water resources; environmental permitting; hazardous waste; design and construction of wells; operation of borehole sites; dangerous substances and explosive atmospheres; use of works equipment; and mineral mining. 
[normal] 
[normal]Apart from ob
[normal]taining 
[normal]PEDLs 
[normal]from DECC for testing for 
[normal]and extraction of methane gas from shale rock, p
[normal]lanning permission has to be granted by local planning authorities
[normal].
[normal]  Natural Resources Wales and the Health and Safety Executive are 
[normal]also 
[normal]consulted
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]notified 
[normal]and involv
[normal]ed 
[normal]during the processes.  The former is concerned with pollution control
[normal] and
[normal] is served notices of the proposed development
[normal], determines
[normal] and issues abstraction licences and discharge 
[normal]consents
[normal] (and possibly flare emission permits)
[normal], whilst the latter has to agree the drilling activity.  
[normal]The agreement of 
[normal]both 
[normal]landowners on the site concerned 
[normal]and
[normal] adjacent landowners has to be obtained and, i
[normal]f coal seams a
[normal]re affected, which is the case in
[normal] many potential areas of Wales, the Coal Authori
[normal]ty will 
[normal]need to 
[normal]be 
[normal]consulted.
[normal]  
[normal]This complex
[normal], multi-layered
[normal] 
[normal]agency process
[normal] 
[normal]involves 
[normal]a number of risks, such as the potential for communication failures; the loss of opportunity to develop wide expertise 
[normal]in
[normal] fracking, and its environmental and other impacts; 
[normal]the lengthy and complex 
[normal]decision making 
[normal]process acting as a barrier to industry development
[normal]; and confusion amongst the public 
[normal]about
[normal] where responsibility lies and how they can engage with the process of granting approvals and permissions.  
[normal]A
[normal]lthough the UK p
[normal]rocess is more robust than that in the US, there are concerns about whether it is 
[normal]fit for purpose and sufficiently 
[normal]robust 
[normal]to ensure environmental 
[normal]and community 
[normal]impacts are minimised
[normal].

[normal]The 
[normal]resourcing 
[normal]of the regulators and the trans
[normal]parency of the approval
[normal] process
[normal]The adequate resourcing of NRW
[normal],
[normal] as the lead regulator 
[normal]in Wales, 
[normal]in terms of manpower and the necessary expertise
[normal],
[normal] will be essential 
[normal]in providing potential developers with the confidence to explore and possibly exploit resources in Wales.
[normal]  
[normal]Regulation is only as good as the resources available for
[normal] setting appropriate permitting conditions and ensuring their subsequent
[normal] enforcement.  
[normal]It is, therefore, important that 
[normal]NRW regulatory staff 
[normal]possess 
[normal]the necessary background experience to manage the processes of 
[normal]fracking 
[normal]effectively
[normal].  
[normal]For the reasons given
[normal] 
[normal]above, the fact that the process
[normal]es
[normal] 
[normal]for 
[normal]granting permission
[normal]s
[normal] for exploration and extraction 
[normal]of shale gas 
[normal]are so complex 
[normal](
[normal]involv
[normal]ing
[normal] the application o
[normal]f a number of 
[normal]regulatory regimes)
[normal] poses significant obstacles to the development and regulation of this sector
[normal],
[normal] and presents 
[normal]difficulties for the public in terms of hav
[normal]ing
[normal] a clear
[normal] and 
[normal]joined up understanding of the overall process. 
[normal]   
[normal]Conclusion[bold]12.
[normal]T
[normal]he
[normal] technology is evolving and major energy companies, such as Centrica, are now investing in this area. 
[normal] 
[normal]Exploitation of shale gas seems to have the potential benefit of bring
[normal]ing greater security of energy supplies
[normal],
[normal] although there is no definitive assessment of the extent of exploitable shale gas reserves in Wales. 
[normal] 
[normal]M
[normal]ore research is needed
[normal], therefore,
[normal] and the regulators need to keep up to date with developments
[normal],
[normal] as well as playing a
[normal]n 
[normal]active role with the industry, policy developers and the research community
[normal].
[normal]13.  T
[normal]he 
[normal]exploitation of 
[normal]shale gas 
[normal]may have 
[normal]the capacity to
[normal] contribute to the Welsh economy
[normal], but t
[normal]here is still a considerable amount of technical, politica
[normal]l, economic
[normal], regulatory
[normal] and environmental work to be done before it can be relied upon as an economically viable energy source 
[normal]that
[normal] can be 
[normal]exploit
[normal]ed
[normal] in a sustainable way.
[normal]  In particular
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]the legal processes 
[normal]that apply to 
[normal]the process of 
[normal]fracking need to be 
[normal]consolidated
[normal] and simplified.  The current system i
[normal]s
[normal] complex requiring permissions and consents from a number of different 
[normal]regulatory 
[normal]bodies
[normal].  
[normal]Accordingly, it is essential that regulators have adequate resources to maintain and develop expertise in, and exp
[normal]erience of, managing the risks to the public and the environment that arise from exploration and exploitation of Wales’s shale gas reserves.
