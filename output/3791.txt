&#xa0;Written evidence from Amanda Carter (CYS0043)&#xa0;&#xa0;I am writing to contribute to the Transport Committee because every cycle ride I take, I do in fear of being knocked off my bike. There is much can be done to remedy the current flaws in the hotch-potch inadequate provision for cyclists.&#xa0;The road situation is getting worse for cyclists, in my view, because:&#xa0;Suggestions to increase safety of cyclists and pedestrians:&#xa0;* the objection that this would hurt business is not, as far as I understand, the experience of other European countries that operate this strategy. Also, surely pedestrians and cyclists have for too long been forced to accept a disproportionate responsibility for adaptation to the needs of motorised traffic.&#xa0;At the end of the day, we would all hope to have outdoor space which children and the elderly can enjoy safely and without being in fear of their lives.Thank you for doing your part in making this a reality.&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;
