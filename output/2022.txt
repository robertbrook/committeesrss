[[[Chelmorton Parish Council â€“ Written evidence]]]&#xa0;Chelmorton Parish Council wishes to record its support for alterations to legislation on unsurfaced byways.&#xa0;Our parish is located in the Peak District National Park and includes on its Eastern border a section of track known as High Stool Lane. This lane is a constant headache for the Peak District National Park Authority and Derbyshire County Council as we have to report the deteriorating surface to them on a regular basis and ask them to make safe for all users.&#xa0;The lane forms part of both the Pennine Bridleway and Midshires Way being part of the route connecting the end of the High Peak Trail with the Monsal Trail. &#xa0;There are regular convoys of offroad bikes and 4x4 vehicles using the track and also horses and walkers and there is frequent conflict between these activities. The Lane rapidly deteriorates when motorised traffic uses it leaving dangerous potholes often waterlogged that provide a hazard for horses and can make the path impassable for walkers.&#xa0;To complicate matters the track is also essential for local farm traffic to the adjoining fields.&#xa0;Chelmorton Parish Council considers that this track is a prime case for a change in legislation. The costs of these continual major repairs that the Peak Park Rangers carry out with assistance from Derbyshire County Council are a drain on valuable resources. While Chelmorton Parish Council does not wish to see any of these activities stopped, we consider that some lanes need designating for specific activities and making other use unlawful. In this case as the track is part of both a National Bridleway and National Walking route, we would like to see the only motorised traffic allowed to use it be for essential farm use.&#xa0;We have raised this matter with the Peak Park and our County Councillor and understand that until legislation is changed then their hands are tied and they have to accommodate all, but with limited resources the track often becomes only usable by off-road vehicles for long periods.&#xa0;We therefore support measures that give the National Park or Highways Authorities the power to change the status of Green Lanes based on local conditions.&#xa0;Yours faithfully&#xa0;Matthew LovellClerk to Chelmorton Parish Council&#xa0;12th September 2013&#xa0;
