[normal]Further submission from Sheffield City Council[bold]Moor Market, Sheffield [bold]Note on EU Procurement Issues[bold]Background[bold]During the mid
[normal] 2000’s, SCC treated with RREEF with a view to RREEF
[normal] developing a new market building for SCC on block 6 to be purchased by SCC on co
[normal]mpletion of the building. RREEF
[normal] appointed its own desi
[normal]gn team and worked up various schemes for the new market. H
[normal]owever, partly because of RREEF
[normal]’s main interests being as an investor rather than a 
[normal]developer as well as the property market crash of 2008
[normal] and, ultimately, its intention to dispose of its interest,
[normal] the scheme did not progress.
