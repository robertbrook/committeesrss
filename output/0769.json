"Written evidence from Dwayne Johnson (LTC 22)&#xa0;\nAs the Strategic Director, Communities with statutory responsibilities for adult social care in \nHalton\n Borough Council\n \nI do feel it is appropriate and relevant that the end of life care services are not forgotten within the context of managing long term conditions.\n \nIt is often very difficult for our health clinicians to provide an accurate pr\nognosis of life expectancy.\n \nWe\n will be informed that an individual has only a short period of life, when on many occasions individuals survive long after their prognosis.\n \nThere are an increasing number of people surviving longer because of improved health and social care services.\n \nThis \nmeans\n care services are managing a long-term condition whereby their life expectancy was determined to be short. \nIn addition it is important to recognise that many people who have a long term condition are nearing the end of their life.\n I therefore believe that the Committee should be \ncognisant\n of these\n matter\ns\n and feel this of relevance to the Inquiry.\n \nI have provided below \na couple of examples to highlight this to the Committee\n.\n&#xa0;The practical assistance offered to commissioners to support the design of services which promote community-based care and provide for the integration of health and social care in the management of long-term conditions&#xa0;\nThe numbers of people dying in hospital has continued to rise whilst a number of surveys indicate that, given a choice, a large majority of people would choose to be cared for at home. Recent \nresearch by the Nuffield Trust reaffirmed the inter-relation of health and social care at the end of life, and the need to provide a holistic approach focused around the individual and their needs and wishes. \nSocial services have access to and make best use of local intelligence (health and social care data sets) to focus on the design and delivery of end of life care improvements in all sectors.\n \nEngagement with the emerging clinical consortia, commissioning support organisations, and health providers across acute and primary care settings, local hospices and local authorities is well developed to ensure the effective pooling of resources to facilitate the commissioning and design of new services, with a clear understanding of the shared service improvement agenda.\n&#xa0;Current examples of effective integration of services across health, social care and other services which treat and manage long-term conditions&#xa0;\nBest practice in end of life care within local authority services includes working with a wide range of stake holders such as hospices local colleges, social care providers including care homes, extra care schemes, domiciliary providers and supported living establishments.\n \nThese networks have allowed commissioners to develop innovative approaches and interventions to support a range of service user groups. The recent publication of the National End of Life programme\n \nâ€˜Sharing successful strategies for implementing 'Supporting people to live and die well highlights good practice across England demonstrates how effective integration can be to support people with long term conditions and in particular those people nearing the end of their life.\nMay 2013\n"
