"Written evidence submitted by the Legal Action Group (LAG) (LAI 0025)&#xa0;\nCivil Legal Aid- the Secret Legal Service?&#xa0;\nLAG has found a disturbing reduction in the take-up of legal aid cases in civil law for the first quarte\nr of the current year, 2013/14.\n&#xa0;\nThe Legal Aid Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders (LASPO) Act \nintroduced sweeping cuts to scope in legal aid from April this year. What LAG’s research shows is that for the cases which are still covered by legal aid there has been a large reduction in the take-up of legal aid services for these by public. We believe \nthis has been caused by\n a combination of factors\n \nincluding, \nthe reduction\n \nin the number of solicitors firms and charities, such as Citizens Advice Bureaux, offering legal aid\n, a perception amongst the\n \npublic \nthat\n \nthey can\n no\n-longer\n \nget help with any civil law problems \nand \nthe failure by the government to adequately advertise the availability of services.\n&#xa0;\nDownward Trend in Cases&#xa0;\nPrevious figures released by LAG show that the number of civil legal aid cases has been in decline over t\nhe last few years. It is in the social welfare law (SWL) category that the biggest falls have occurred. From just under half a million cases at their peak in 2009-10 the number of SWL cases had dropped to 293,319 last year.\n The following table breaks down\n the figures for legal help and certificated cases for the five categories of SWL-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2009/10\n2010/11\n2011/12\n2012/13\nWelfare benefits\n143,865\n120,042\n110,771\n88,618\nDebt\n&#xa0;\n147,194\n128,179\n109,427\n82,117\nHousing\n&#xa0;\n153,106\n127,840\n118,909\n100,253\nEmployment/Discrimination\n31,796\n25,330\n20,324\n16,148\nCommunity Care\n9,703\n7,060\n7,448\n6,183\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n485,664\n408,451\n366,879\n293,319\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe reducing number of SWL cases is surprising given the continuing difficult economic outlook and the numbers of \ncases reaching the courts and tribunals system. For example in the quarter ending 31\nst\n Dec 2012 there had been a 48% increase in the number of cases brought to the Social Security and Child Support Tribunal.\n Citizens Advice has also reported increasing nu\nmbers of enquiries in the first three quarters of 2012/13. However, in the final quarter Bureaux capacity to deal with specialist cases was reduced as they prepared for the withdrawal of legal aid from much of SWL. \n We believe the reduction in the numbers\n of cases since 2010 has been caused by changes to the system, such as the reduction in the numbers of cases legal aid firm are permitted to commence, rather than a decrease in the numbers of people needing assistance. \n&#xa0;\nThe trend over the last few years \nha\ns been of concern, but the\n latest \nfigures \nfor the first quarter of the current year (outlined below) show that the take-up of legal aid services in common areas of \ncivil \nlaw has fallen off a cliff.\n&#xa0;\nFewer Cases than Predicted&#xa0;\nThe following table shows \nthe percentage number of cases which the government predicted would remain in scope after the cuts were introduced in April-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCategory of law\n&#xa0;\nDebt\n (mainly housing related)\n26%\nEducation\n42%\nDiscrimination\n100%\nHousing\n60%\nWelfare Benefits\n0\n&#xa0;\nThe above table refers to legal help cases. Legal help cases \ninvolve\n initial advice and assistance to a client. Some cases go onto legal representation, but the bulk of cases referred to in this report remain at the legal help level. For example in 2012/13 there were 81,944 new matters started for legal help \nwith\n debt\n prob\nlems\n, but only 353 cases went on to the next level, civil representation.\n&#xa0;\nThe table below shows the total number of \nlegal help \ncases for each category of law for the first quarter of the current year, the projected number of cases \nis \nbased on the governm\nent’s estimates and the percentage shortfall in the number of cases\n has been calculated by LAG\n.\n The analysis is based on figures from the Legal Aid Agency (LAA)\n the new body which was established within the Ministry of Justice from April this year to admi\nnister legal aid. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nApril\nMay\nJune\nTotal\nProjected number of cases\n%Shortfall\nDebt\n173\n146\n157\n476\n1,467\n68%\nEducation\n91\n69\n121\n281\n318\n12%\nDiscrimination\n168\n205\n179\n552\n2,429\n77%\nHousing\n806\n631\n705\n2,142\n3,238\n34%\nWelfare Benefits\n45\n48\n42\n135\n0\n0%\n&#xa0;\n1,2831,0991,2043,5867,452&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nA total of 3,866 less people than predicted received civil legal aid. \nThis is a total shortfall of 52%.  The shortfalls do vary between the \ndifferent \ncategories of law\n, with the lowest being \nin education law \nat\n 12%\n and the\n highest\n \nbeing \nin discrimination law \nat\n 77%.\n  \n&#xa0;\nLAG believes that the very large shortfall in discrimination law can be explained by the 100% reduction in the availability of legal aid for employment law cases. \nIn the employment law category \nthe government projected that 78% of cases\n,\n \nout of a total of 24,000, \nwould be taken from scope\n. T\nhe remaining 22\n% would be discrimination ones. However, m\nost discrimination law cases usually stem from a dispute in the workplace, but as no legal aid is ava\nilable for employment law advice people who have been discriminated against are less likely to seek help.\n Another factor in the low take-up of legal aid for discrimination\n,\n \nas well as debt \ncases\n,\n might also be the government’s decision to shift all initial\n enquiries onto \nthe Civil Legal Advice (CLA) service which is an internet and telephone based \nservice\n.\n&#xa0;\nLow take-up of Housing and Debt Cases&#xa0;\nLegal Aid is \nstill \navailable for people in danger of losing their homes\n, homelessness cases and for some \ndisrepair matters\n. Such cases can be covered by either the debt or housing law categories. \nDebt legal aid contracts were mainly concentrated among advice charities such as Citizens Advice Bureaux. These have seen the biggest reduction in the number of lega\nl aid contract holders\n.\n According to\n the national charity,\n Citizen’s Advice\n,\n there are now only just over 30\n \nof its \nbureaux with legal aid contracts, down from a total of over 160 before the cuts were imposed in April.\n&#xa0;\nBirmingham CAB held one of the largest legal aid contracts in the not for profit sector. The service operates out of four offices in \nBirmingham\n. Prior to April it employed 27 specialist caseworkers in debt and welfare benefits, but according to Emma Cook, \nacting Chief Executive\n of the Bureaux, all \nof \nthese post holders \nhave \nhad to be made redundant or redeployed, “the loss of the £750,000 contract for legal aid meant a third of the service \nwent\n from 31\nst\n March. These specialist services cannot be replaced b\ny volunteers.”\n&#xa0;\nRussell Conway, is an experienced housing law solicitor who recently won the Legal Aid Lawyer of the Year Award for his work in housing and other areas of social welfare law\n. He blames in part the unrelenting bad news on legal aid for the \nreduction in cases, “the public are quite good at picking-up on the grim stuff”, but “find it difficult to know exactly what\n’\ns happened.” He \ns\nays that “some local authorities and social landlords have been peddling the rumour that legal aid for housing cas\nes has been abolished completely\n. Some of my\n clients have been pleasantly surprised when \nI’ve\n told them they can still get legal aid for their case.\n”\n \n&#xa0;\nMany practitioners have told LAG they believe that there is a problem \nover the \nidentification of clients\n who are eligible for legal aid as the rules now are so complex.\n Vicky Ling is a management consultant and author of LAG’\ns Legal Aid Handbook. \nShe\n says that\n “the Legal Aid Agency is now so draconian in their audits that practitioners fear applying for lega\nl aid unless they are absolutely certain it will fall within the rules.” \n&#xa0;\nWelfare benefits cases were cut by 100% from April, but 135 new cases were commenced in April, May and June this year. This is around 3% of the cases which were reported in the same\n period last year. \nLAG believes that these cases are Higher Tribunal, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court cases which relate to an appeal on a point of law,\n&#xa0;\nOnly in family law does the number of cases exceed the projected number of cases significantly \n(14%), but this could be due to a combination of the tapering effect and the greater number of firms still providing services\n, (from April there were 2227 family law legal aid contracts against \n703 housing and debt contracts\n).\n&#xa0;\nLack of Marketing&#xa0;\nPam Kenw\northy is the \nLegal Director\n at the solicitors \nfirm Howells LLP\n. The firm \nwon one of the contracts for the telephone gateway service. \nKenworthy\n believes that both lawyers and the public need to get the message that employment law discrimination cases are st\nill covered by legal aid. “The CLA providers would obviously like the Ministry of Justice to consider raising the profile of the service with stakeholders as it seems daft to have a service that no one knows about.” \n&#xa0;\nThe Legal Aid Practitioners Group \n(LAPG) has expressed concerns to the government about the adequacy of the marketing of legal aid services, “we believe it has been inadequate\n and is some cases unfortunately misleading\n” says Carol Storer, LAPG Director, “the information which is available \ndoes not provide clear guidance to the public about what is covered by legal aid.”\n&#xa0;\nExceptional Cases&#xa0;\nAs part of the provisions in the LASPO Act the government int\nroduced a revamped exceptional funding\n rule to ensure people with cases out of scope c\nan\n get\n assistance if their human rights had been breached\n.\n \nThe LAA had estimated that there would 5-7000 cases granted annually.\n&#xa0;\nF\nigures \nfrom the LAA \nreveal that there were only 233 applications for exceptional funding in \nApril, May and June this year the first\n quarter of \noperation \nfor\n the scheme.  Only two grants of exceptional funding \nto clients \nhave been made in non-inquest cases (funding for inquest cases was usually granted under the previous exceptional funding scheme). The Public Law Project \n(PLP) \nhas \nexpressed concerns about these figures as they are very low compared to the original projections and there is evidence of poor quality decision making in the cases being rejected.\n&#xa0;\nIt is difficult not to conclude that the LAA is being deliberately obstruc\ntive in not allowing many of the claims\n. The PLP talks of the “poor quality of decision-making” in the cases which it has seen and expresses concern about the low number of applicants who seek reviews of the decisions.\n&#xa0;\nLAG has spoken to many practitioner\ns who are not prepared to apply for exceptional funding as they have no guarantee of payment for the work\n unless the application is suc\nc\nessful\n. \nChris Johnson of the Community Law Partnership in \nBirmingham\n has submitted a number of exceptional funding appli\ncations but\n says\n “we cannot afford to keep on doing this work pro-bono.”\n&#xa0;\nCivil Legal Aid under threat&#xa0;The reduced take-up of civil legal aid has been caused by the combination of factors described above, dwindling numbers of firms and agencies \nundertaking legal\n aid\n, increased bureaucratic hurdl\nes before legal aid is granted \nand a low profile, caused by lack of marketing and a public perception that legal aid is no-longer available for civil cases. Either by accident or design\n,\n the government see\nms to be presiding over a secret legal service\n. The fear is if nothing is done to increase the take-up of civil legal aid\n,\n the remaining services will wither away as the lack of use will be used to justify their loss.\n&#xa0;\nLAG calls on the government to increa\nse the profile of civil legal aid services \nthrough better marketing via\n the web and other channels. We are also calling for an urgent review of the exceptional funding mechanism as it is clearly not providing the human rights safety net it was intended to.\n  \n&#xa0;\n25 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n4\nLAG September 2013\n- updated version 25-9-13\n Legal Aid Statistics in \nEngland\n and Wales 2012-2013\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/177045/quarterly-tribs-q3-2012-13.pdf\n See  \nAdvice trends January - March 2013\n&#xa0;\n(\n&#xa0;\n0.52mb)\n Based on Reform of Legal Aid in \nEngland\n \nand \nWales\n: the Government Response, June 2011 Annex A Scope\n Legal Aid Statistics in \nEngland\n and Wales 2012-13, published June 2013\n See Annex to this report\n LAG believes the figures only relate to enquiries made through the CLA telephone service and s\no some figures for housing cases which are not all covered by CLA are missing.
