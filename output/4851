&#xa0;
[normal]Supplementary written evidence submitted by The Football Association [WAS0048][bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Many thanks for inviting me and The Football Association to give 
[normal]evidence to the Select Committee
[normal] 
[normal]last week. I wanted to take this opportunity to provide you with a little further information following
[normal] 
[normal]our discussion which perhaps you can consider as supplementary evidence. I shall also share this
[normal] 
[normal]letter with the member
[normal]s of your committee too.
[normal]Two points which seemed to strike a chord with the committee were mixed football and the new
[normal] 
[normal]structure the Women Super League, so I wanted to briefly expand on those two points for you.
[normal]The FA reviews mixed football on a yearly bas
[normal]is and last approved an extension of mixed-football to
[normal] 
[normal]U1
[normal]5
[normal]s in May this year. This was completed on the back of extensive research with Brune
[normal]l
[normal] University
[normal] 
[normal]and consultation within the game. We will continue to review the need for extending the age range
[normal] 
[normal]of m
[normal]ixed football based on physical development, empirical evidence and legal expertise.
[normal]The FA continues to oppose mixed-football in adult football and prohibits it within any of its
[normal] 
[normal]affiliated teams or competitions; this is based on the lack of evidence of s
[normal]afety. The FA is, however,
[normal] 
[normal]keen to review this matter regularly, but it should be noted that we do so from the perspective of
[normal] 
[normal]equality rather than encouraging female participation. Girls taking part in mixed football are nearly
[normal] 
[normal]always those who have played
[normal] regularly before and only amount to approximately 500 players per
[normal] 
[normal]year in England.
[normal]In terms of elite football, we are very encouraged by the progress made by the FA Women's Super
[normal] 
[normal]League since its inception. In the last year FAWSL attendances have increase
[normal]d by 23 percent with
[normal] 
[normal]major games regularly attracting over 1,000 spectators. A new broadcast platform has also been
[normal] 
[normal]secured for 2014-17 with BBC and BT Sport working in partnership to broadcast live senior
[normal] 
[normal]internationals and The FA Women's Cup with weekly 
[normal]domestic coverage of the FAWSL on BT Sport.
[normal]The introduction of a summer league was completed in consultation with the women's teams across
[normal] 
[normal]the country and the overwhelming majority were in favour of what has proved to be a successful
[normal] 
[normal]change. I'm aware th
[normal]at a concern was raised about the leve
[normal]l
[normal] of funding for teams in the Women's
[normal] 
[normal]Premier League today compared to before the FAWSL was introduced, however this simply does not
[normal] 
[normal]compare like for like. The WPL today is the third tier of English women's football wh
[normal]ereas it was the
[normal] 
[normal]top tier previously; it is the status of the League and not the name of the League that should indicate
[normal] 
[normal]the level of comparison in this instance.
[normal]Should you like further information on these or any other topics please do let me know as I w
[normal]ould be
[normal] 
[normal]happy to provide more information for you for the final report. I am sure that the final document
[normal] 
[normal]will not only examine the work done by national governing bodies to raise the profile of women's
[normal] 
[normal]and girls' football in recent years but, alongside sp
[normal]orting recommendations, provide non-sporting
[normal] 
[normal]recommendations for Government which will help improve participation.
[normal]For example, the Government should be commended for recent changes to the CASC programme
[normal] 
[normal]which sees further financial help extended to sports
[normal] clubs. However, if the Government were to
[normal] 
[normal]provide additional benefits such as further rate relief or tax benefits for providing specific
[normal] 
[normal]programmes for girls and women, we would see an increase in community lead interventions for
[normal] 
[normal]women's sport.
[normal]The FA wou
[normal]ld also recommend that Government considers ensuring that Local Authorities have a
[normal] 
[normal]statutory obligation to provide sport and produce a Local Authority Development Plan which
[normal] 
[normal]explicitly considers girls' and women's provision. 80% of football is played on Lo
[normal]cal Authority
[normal] 
[normal]facilities and, as a non-statutory provision, local investment in sport is beginning to be hit hard
[normal] 
[normal]especially
[normal] 
[normal]in northern England.
[normal]Finally, football has experienced a real change in the perception of elite women's football in recent
[normal] 
[normal]years th
[normal]anks to improved media coverage of the product. We recommend Government continues to
[normal] 
[normal]encourage broadcasters to promote better coverage of women's sports. Football has undoubtedly
[normal] 
[normal]benefitted from the increased coverage we have received by being able to attr
[normal]act sponsors who
[normal] 
[normal]want to be associated with the product and want to activate their sponsorship- our football festivals
[normal] 
[normal]sponsored by Continental Tyres and supported by UEFA and Sport England have reached over 10,000
[normal] 
[normal]girls this year at 33 Football Festivals 
[normal]and match day fanzones. Unfortunately the Women's Super
[normal] 
[normal]League is still heavily subsidised by the sponsorship and media rights from our men's team;
[normal] 
[normal]however, we are putting the building blocks together for a long term sustainable product.
[normal]Many thanks again 
[normal]for inviting me to give evidence and I wish you success in creating the final
[normal] 
[normal]report.
