defaultSupplementary written evidence submitted by The Football Association [WAS0048]default&#xa0;
defaultMany thanks for inviting me and The Football Association to give 
defaultevidence to the Select Committee
default 
defaultlast week. I wanted to take this opportunity to provide you with a little further information following
default 
defaultour discussion which perhaps you can consider as supplementary evidence. I shall also share this
default 
defaultletter with the member
defaults of your committee too.
defaultTwo points which seemed to strike a chord with the committee were mixed football and the new
default 
defaultstructure the Women Super League, so I wanted to briefly expand on those two points for you.
defaultThe FA reviews mixed football on a yearly bas
defaultis and last approved an extension of mixed-football to
default 
defaultU1
default5
defaults in May this year. This was completed on the back of extensive research with Brune
defaultl
default University
default 
defaultand consultation within the game. We will continue to review the need for extending the age range
default 
defaultof m
defaultixed football based on physical development, empirical evidence and legal expertise.
defaultThe FA continues to oppose mixed-football in adult football and prohibits it within any of its
default 
defaultaffiliated teams or competitions; this is based on the lack of evidence of s
defaultafety. The FA is, however,
default 
defaultkeen to review this matter regularly, but it should be noted that we do so from the perspective of
default 
defaultequality rather than encouraging female participation. Girls taking part in mixed football are nearly
default 
defaultalways those who have played
default regularly before and only amount to approximately 500 players per
default 
defaultyear in England.
defaultIn terms of elite football, we are very encouraged by the progress made by the FA Women's Super
default 
defaultLeague since its inception. In the last year FAWSL attendances have increase
defaultd by 23 percent with
default 
defaultmajor games regularly attracting over 1,000 spectators. A new broadcast platform has also been
default 
defaultsecured for 2014-17 with BBC and BT Sport working in partnership to broadcast live senior
default 
defaultinternationals and The FA Women's Cup with weekly 
defaultdomestic coverage of the FAWSL on BT Sport.
defaultThe introduction of a summer league was completed in consultation with the women's teams across
default 
defaultthe country and the overwhelming majority were in favour of what has proved to be a successful
default 
defaultchange. I'm aware th
defaultat a concern was raised about the leve
defaultl
default of funding for teams in the Women's
default 
defaultPremier League today compared to before the FAWSL was introduced, however this simply does not
default 
defaultcompare like for like. The WPL today is the third tier of English women's football wh
defaultereas it was the
default 
defaulttop tier previously; it is the status of the League and not the name of the League that should indicate
default 
defaultthe level of comparison in this instance.
defaultShould you like further information on these or any other topics please do let me know as I w
defaultould be
default 
defaulthappy to provide more information for you for the final report. I am sure that the final document
default 
defaultwill not only examine the work done by national governing bodies to raise the profile of women's
default 
defaultand girls' football in recent years but, alongside sp
defaultorting recommendations, provide non-sporting
default 
defaultrecommendations for Government which will help improve participation.
defaultFor example, the Government should be commended for recent changes to the CASC programme
default 
defaultwhich sees further financial help extended to sports
default clubs. However, if the Government were to
default 
defaultprovide additional benefits such as further rate relief or tax benefits for providing specific
default 
defaultprogrammes for girls and women, we would see an increase in community lead interventions for
default 
defaultwomen's sport.
defaultThe FA wou
defaultld also recommend that Government considers ensuring that Local Authorities have a
default 
defaultstatutory obligation to provide sport and produce a Local Authority Development Plan which
default 
defaultexplicitly considers girls' and women's provision. 80% of football is played on Lo
defaultcal Authority
default 
defaultfacilities and, as a non-statutory provision, local investment in sport is beginning to be hit hard
default 
defaultespecially
default 
defaultin northern England.
defaultFinally, football has experienced a real change in the perception of elite women's football in recent
default 
defaultyears th
defaultanks to improved media coverage of the product. We recommend Government continues to
default 
defaultencourage broadcasters to promote better coverage of women's sports. Football has undoubtedly
default 
defaultbenefitted from the increased coverage we have received by being able to attr
defaultact sponsors who
default 
defaultwant to be associated with the product and want to activate their sponsorship- our football festivals
default 
defaultsponsored by Continental Tyres and supported by UEFA and Sport England have reached over 10,000
default 
defaultgirls this year at 33 Football Festivals 
defaultand match day fanzones. Unfortunately the Women's Super
default 
defaultLeague is still heavily subsidised by the sponsorship and media rights from our men's team;
default 
defaulthowever, we are putting the building blocks together for a long term sustainable product.
defaultMany thanks again 
defaultfor inviting me to give evidence and I wish you success in creating the final
default 
defaultreport.
