Conclusion.default&#xa0;defaultBrief Introduction.default&#xa0;default   I am an individual defaultwho has held a full driving licence since the late 1960's, &amp; has had extensive driving experience in the Middle East and Europe including the UK, during this time I have had no cautions or convictions for any motoring offence, or even a parking fine. Theredefaultfore I feel that I have had sufficient experience to comment on the subject being considered by the Transport Committee.default   I have no opinions for or against cyclists, nor defaultany support for 'Petrol Heads' or other individuals who believe the car isdefault king. defaultHowdefaultever ,default there is a growing body of 'cyclist-activists' who wish to claim the roads for themselves. default&#xa0;defaultMain Thrust of Discussion.default&#xa0;default1. defaultBias in favour of cyclists on the roads.default&#xa0;default    Once again a cyclist-activist has been on TV (Mr Chris Boardman on the Daily Podefaultlitics show, Wed 18th Dec. 2013) blaming all cyclist deaths on vehicles. Although it is agreed that city roads tend to be more unsafe than town or rural roads, the blame for cyclist deaths or injuries defaultcan notdefault always be blamed on others, and not the cyclistdefault themselves.default   When a cyclist-activist appears on/in the media, there is never anyone from the non-cycling section of the community to counter the defaultcyclistsdefault claims.default&#xa0;default2. defaultSafety.default&#xa0;default   defaultidefault. Many cyclists do not wear safety helmets, Mr Chris Boardman on the Politdefaultics Show was not wearing a helmet, &amp; side tracked the question 'why not?default'.default&#xa0;default   ii. A growing number of cyclists fail to have front &amp; rear lights, even in the dark. Even Mr Boardman did not have them fitted, yes it was daylight but it could have started defaultraining.default&#xa0;default   iii. Many cyclists do not wear reflective clothing or accessories.default&#xa0;default   iv. There is no check or requirement for cyclists to have eyesight tests, or inform relevant authority if they have a medical problem.default&#xa0;default   v. Many cyclists carry rucksacks defaulton their back, this makes for a high defaultcenterdefault of gravity, and more chance of losing control.default&#xa0;default3. defaultTraining.default&#xa0;default   defaultidefault. There is no requirement for a cyclist to be tested on the 'Highway Code', but motorist are.default&#xa0;default  ii. There is no requirement for cyclists to takedefault a cyclist driving test, unlike motorists. In fact an individual can purchase a cycle and immediately cycle on the road without previously riding a cycle.default&#xa0;default4. defaultRoad Craft.default&#xa0;default   defaultidefault. Very often cyclists drive through red lights.default&#xa0;default   ii. They also cycle across pdefaultedestrian crossings to cut through traffic.default&#xa0;default   iii. Cyclists think that footpaths &amp; pavements are for their use and not pedestrians. If advised by pedestrians, reply with 'F*** defaultOffdefault'. Even in defaultpedestrianiseddefault precincts cyclists cycle through with the Police defaultjust standing &amp; watching.default&#xa0;default   iv. More of a problem are the groups of cyclists who ride two &amp; three abreast.default&#xa0;default   v. Cyclists manoeuvre without hand signals, &amp; change lanes between vehicles.default&#xa0;default   vi. They ride up centrally behind HGVs, vans, &amp; buses and thendefault attempt to undertake from the blind spot.default&#xa0;default5. defaultMechanical Road Worthiness.default&#xa0;default   There is no requirement for a cycle to be 'tested' to insure that lights, tyres, or brakes are in good condition and working. However, all vehicles &amp; motorbikes have to have an defaultMOT test.default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default6. defaultRegulation.default&#xa0;default   defaultidefault. There is no requirement for cycles to be registered and have a visible registration plate. As a motorist, my car has to be registered by the DVLA and my number plates visible &amp; in good condition.default&#xa0;default   ii. Cyclists are not rdefaultequired by law to have a minimum 3rd Party Insurance to cover damage to other vehicles. Once again for motorists this is a requirement.default&#xa0;default   iii. Cyclists are not required by law to pay the Annual Road Tax, but are complaining about not enough cycle lanes adefaultnd many pot holes.default&#xa0;default   iv. Without registration plates there is no way to curb the poor road craft at junctions and make cyclists liable for breaking the Highway Code.default&#xa0;default7. defaultConclusion.default&#xa0;default   defaultEverydaydefault in Chepstow I see one or more cyclists acting as in Para's default2 &amp; 4 above. In addition there is a purpose built cycle path alongside the A466 Link Road from Chepstow to Junction 2 of the M48. Yet cyclists still insist on cycling along the A466, instead of the cycle path which is clearly marked.default   In Bristol (City ofdefault the Bike) it is even worse, cyclists ignore cycle lanes, short cut roundabouts using zebra crossings, cycle down roads on the wrong side, &amp; even go down one way streets the wrong way, against oncoming traffic.default   Yes, I am a car owner &amp; driver, and admit defaultthat some drivers pull some daft manoeuvres on the roads. However, for any small infringement I am liable for an on the spot fine by Police, for example a light going out during the journey.defaultRecommendations.default&#xa0;default  defaultidefault. A National Education &amp; Publicity Programmedefault should be implemented to educate defaultcyclistsdefault, this is ongoing for motorists to be aware of motorbikes under the 'Think Bike' campaign.default&#xa0;default   ii. It should be made compulsory by law for cyclists to wear safety helmets &amp; reflective clothing/equipment, and be liadefaultble for an on the spot fine by Police. Obviously persons wearing turbans due to religion to be exempt.default&#xa0;default   iii. It should be compulsory by law that cycles are roadworthy, and the cyclist liable to on the spot fines by Police. This to include tyres, lights,default &amp; brakes, an ideal would be for cycles to have to defaultunder godefault an official cycle MOT and be certificated.default&#xa0;default   iv. The introduction of compulsory minimum 3rd Party Insurance for cyclists.default&#xa0;default   v. The introduction of an Annual Cycle Road Tax for cycles.default&#xa0;defaultFinally.default&#xa0;default   Mr Chris Boardman is a poor example of a safe cyclist, yes he is a gold medal winner, but that was on track, during the short film on the Politics Show pontificating about safety for cyclists, he had no helmet, no reflective clothing, no lightdefaults on his bike (even though it was daylight, it could have started to rain), and even on TV failed to indicate that he was moving off into traffic. Last but not least, it appeared at one stage towards the end he was actually cycling along the pavement.default   Tdefaulthis is typical of the cycling-activists who rant that vehicles are not in tune with them, but they ignore simple rules. They rant about cyclist deaths, no wants these, but it is never mentioned if &amp; when a cyclist was at fault. Seeing some of the cyclists defaultaround, it is a good bet some of these accidents are defaultself imposeddefault.default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
