The figures are specifically for electricity policies and include budgets for the Feed-in Tariff policy and legacy spending on the Renewables Obligation.&#xa0;

[[[/21]]]£4.30bn£4.90bn£5.60bn£6.45bn£7.00bn£7.60bn&#xa0;Of the £7.6bn, £3.5bn is expected be absorbed by legacy spending from the Renewables Obligation and £1.2bn by the small-scale Feed-In Tariffiii, leaving only about £3bn to support new low carbon developments through the Contract for Difference (CfD). The Government has not committed to increasing the Levy cap post 2020/21. Without such indications from Government, all developers ofrenewable and low carbon energy must operate under the assumption that the £7.6bn is a finite limit and allocation of CfDs that start after 2020/21 will need to be accounted for within that cap. Given the zero-sum nature of this game, post-2020 allocation will prevent deployment of projects before that time, unless Government makes an early move to set an increased budget for the period after 2020.&#xa0;

[[[r]]]On the 21st of October 2013 DECC announcediv that it had reached agreement with EDF on the CfD terms for Hinkley Point C. The strike price agreed with EDF is £92.50/MWh, reducing to £89.50 should the company move forward with its investment in new reactors at its Sizewell site. While it was announced that the CfD length would be 35 years, the rest of the key CfD terms are not expected tobe published until 2014.&#xa0;While Hinkley Point will commission in 2023, outside of the current LCF period, in the absence of any Government undertaking on post 2021 uplift in the LCF, developers must operate on the assumption that whatever sums are envisaged to be paid under the Hinkley CfD will be ring-fenced within the£7.6bn 2015-21 Levy cap. While it is difficult to estimate the precise level of Levy funding that will be required to meet the Hinkley Point CfD obligations without knowing the key terms of the contract or the wholesale electricity price in 2023 and beyond, we believe a figure in the region of £1bn/year or approximately one third of the CfD budget allowance, is a reasonable estimate at this stage.&#xa0;

[[[y]]]RenewableUK is confident that there is sufficient wind project capacity being developed that can be brought forward by 2020 to ensure that our renewable targets for that date are met. We are also confident that an LCF limit of £7.6bn would allow enough of that capacity to access support. However, if significant amounts of this budget are ‘sterilised’ by having to be earmarked for projects delivering after 2020, the ability of the renewable industry to meet these and other objectives is threatened. In particular, there may be insufficient room within the LCF envelope to deliver enough offshore wind capacity to ensure that a robust supply chain is established and cost reduction objectives are met, squandering the first mover advantage that the UK currently holds in this technology.squandering the first mover advantage that the UK currently holds in this technology.It may be possible to account for both the CfD for Hinkley Point C and achieve the UK’s 2020ambitions for renewable energy. However, without undertakings from Government to increase the LCF post 2020, should further CfD terms be agreed for new nuclear plant coming online in the mid to late  2020s,  the  ability  of  the  LCF  to  enable  development at  scale  of  renewables be  severely undermined. It would be advantageous for Government to commit early to increasing the LCF budget post-2020, and making clear that the Hinkley Point C CfD and any further nuclear plant would be financed from that budgetary increase.&#xa0;Moreover, we note that the financial commitment to deploying new nuclear plant – not only at Hinkley but also potentially at other sites – outside of the current LCF period is not a commitment that has been  extended to  renewable generators. While  renewable deployment is  underpinned by  2020 renewable energy targets, there is a distinct lack of a strong policy driver for further significant deployment of renewables. Indeed, the Government is opposing European Commission proposals to extend renewable energy targets to 2030 and has deferred setting a 2030 decarbonisation target until after the next election – both of which would enhance industry confidence in the post 2020 UK renewables market.&#xa0;i HMT, Spending Review https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/203826/Spending_review_2010.pdfii DECC, LCF Update https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/223654/emr_consultation_annex_d.pdfiii FoI request 12/1550, https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/12-1550-levy-control-framework-spending-estimatesiv  https://www.gov.uk/government/news/initial-agreement-reached-on-new-nuclear-power-station-at-hinkley&#xa0;28 October 2013&#xa0;
