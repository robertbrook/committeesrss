"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by John Barry (WSC076)T\nitle: \nA l\neaky pipeline\n,\n or\n reasoned\n life\n choice\ns\n?\n1/ \nExecutive summary\nThis memorandum addresses \nthe qu\nestion of why women are less represented than men at the top of the \ncareer ladder\n in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) areas\n, and what universities and the government might seek to do about this.\n \nThe conclusion is that many women don’t continue STEM careers because they opt for other life choices. Therefore, unive\nrsities and the government would be misguided to give preferential treatment to women in fields they have chosen not to develop careers in. \n2/ \nAbout the author\nI am a research co-ordinator working for University College London \n(UCL) \nin the Institute for \nWomen’s Health. My work entails initiating and support research projects in the field of women’s health, mainly in the area of polycystic ovary syndrome. I am a chartered psychologist, and my \nMSc and \nPhD \ndissertations were on \nthe \nsubject of the \npsychologic\nal \ndimensions\n of polycystic ovary syndrome. \nI also tutor in research methods and statistics. \n3/ \nMy interest in positive action for women in STEM began shortly after I began my current position with UCL in Sept 2011. Having been a mature student, I was \nkeen to ensure that my career had every chance of progressing in a timely fashion. I was therefore very interested to receive an email from UCL regarding career-enhancing opportunities being made available\n through a scheme called Athena Swan\n. However when \nI responded to the email I was told that I could not participate, because the scheme was for women o\nnly\n. \nThus began my interest in the topic of the promotion of women in STEM. \n4/ \nDeclaration of interests\nThe author is a man attempting to have a successfu\nl career in a STEM field.\n \nSeptember 2013\n5/ Factual information that the committee should be aware ofQ: \nWhy do numbers of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder?\n&#xa0;\nAbout a year ago the Universi\nty and College Union circulated a\n document called ‘The Chemistry PhD: the impact on women’s retention’ (RSC, 2008). It supp\nosedly demonstrated how women a\nre held back from careers in chemistry, and was given as an example of how women were held back in STEM careers in general. I read the \ndocument and was surprised that anyone could come to any other conclusion than that the women in the study didn’t want a career in chemi\nstry because \nit simply wasn’t the kind of career they wanted to get into. The author of the study concluded that female \nPhD students more than male had \n“\nformed the impression \nthe doctoral research process is an ordeal filled with frustration, pressure and\n \nstress, which a career in research would only prolong”\n (\nRSC 2008, p.7).\n \nThe main reasons seemed to revolve around the th\neme that a career in chemistry was solitary, entailed long hours, stress, a competitive (“macho”) culture and was not conducive “with other aspects of their life, particularly relationships and family” (\nRSC 2008, p.7).\n \nOther rese\narch has found similar opin\nions\n amongst\n women \nregarding STEM careers \n(e.g. \nO’Driscoll\n and Anderson, 1994), yet these papers are presented as evidence that it is some kind of gender-based discriminated that holds these women back. \nRather than supporting women’s choices, there are tho\nse in acade\nmia who appear oblivious\n to women’s choices.\n&#xa0;\n6/ \nQ: \nWhat role should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers? \nIn government too there is concern that women’s life choices are holding them back in the workplace. For example, \nMP Lynn Featherstone’s says: “I think that it [having a baby] is a bit of a setback to women because it gives an opportunity – whether it’s in\n commerce, politics or wherever you work – to men to climb the ladder faster. There is a period of a woman’s life – where she may need to take a break or work at a different rate. I have seen many mediocre men on the boards of directors…they get there beca\nuse they had no [career] break along the way. And some get to the top because of who they knew.” \n(The Telegraph, 2012). Again, the focus appears to be on promoting women in the workplace rather than respecting women’s rights to a family life. \nAlthough the \nevidence for women being disadvantaged in regards STEM opportunities is limited, the evidence that children are disadvantaged by being left \nin inadequate\n \ndaycare\n is much clearer (Todd et al, 2001)\n&#xa0;\n7\n/ \nQ: \nWhat should universities and the higher education \nsector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice?\nOne solution that has been widely adopted \nin universities in the UK \nis the \nAthena Swann Charter. This is scheme that aims to promote women in STE\nM fields through a wide variety \nof programmes e.g. training \nthose in \nmanagement to be aware of their own ‘unconscious bias’ in \nthe \nhiring and promotion of women, special mentoring schemes for women, and access to career networks for women. The aim appears \nto be to have as many women \nas men \nin the top jobs in STEM, and anything short of this \nis an unacceptable gender inequality\n.\n T\nhe first principal of the Athena Swan\n charter is to “To address gender inequalities requires commitment and action from everyone, \nat all levels of the organisation” (Athena Swan Charter, 2012). In my opinion, the use of the term ‘gender inequalities’ is misused here because it carries with it connotations of sex discrimination; this is misplaced in a situation where the ‘inequality’ \nis based on women’s choice not to develop careers in a given field\n.\n8/ \nShould universities adopt the Athena Swann charter? \nLesley \nYellowlees\n the firs\nt female president \nof the \nRoyal Society of Chemistry (RSC). \nShe is\n a supporter of the Athena Swan Charter, \nand \nsaid in an interview: “I’m not an advocate of po\nsitive discrimination…\n. “I want women to feel like they achieved what they\n’ve achieved on their o\nwn merit\n” (ACS, 2013)\n.\n \nThis raises the question of how the ‘leaky pipeline’ is repaired without resorting to positive discrimination. \n9/ \nAlthough positive discrimination in the workplace is illegal in the UK, ‘positive action’ is perfectly legal. What is \nthe difference between the two? \nThe latter is \ndeemed acceptable based\n on the proportionate principle: how serious the inequality is and how important the need is. \nHowever, proportionate action\n depends on the perception of the employer, which in turn depend\ns on the evidence available to the employer. My concerns are that (1) many employers will make poor decisions about employment pr\nactices based on weak evidence, such as the RSC\n \n(2008) \npaper cited above, or based upon \n“\ndiscussion with employees or their rep\nresentatives\n”\n, \nrather than sound evidence, \nas suggested in \nthe government’s \nEquality Action note (Jarrett 2011, p.8\n), and (2) this will create a \nbarrier to men to progress in the STEM workplace. \nUnlike \nLyn\nn Featherstone, I do not presume that many of the m\nen in top jobs are\n ‘mediocre’\n, but \npeople who have worked hard and \nwho should not be systematically disadvantaged because of their sex. \n \n10/ \nThere are cases where there is a reasonable argument for that women having priority over men in filling certain \njobs. This might be seen around issues of religion (e.g. where a woman prefers not to be seen by a male doctor) or sensitivity (e.g. personal care of elderly women). The same reasoning applies to corresponding jobs for men. However there is no reasonable a\nrgument for giving women preferential access to jobs or career development opportunities in cases where a man might just as easily do the job. The reality of the job market is\n that it is a zero-sum game:\n giving advantage to one pe\nrson is to disadvantage an\nother, and does not lead to equality.\n&#xa0;\n11/ Recommendations for the committee to consider including in its reportI recommend that the following be included in the committee’s report:\n&#xa0;\n12/ \nREFERENCESACS (\n2013). \nLesley \nYellowlees\n.\n \nhttp://cen.acs.org/articles/90/i30/Lesley-Yellowlees.html\n  Accessed online 3rd Sept 2013\nAthena Swan (2012).
