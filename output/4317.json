"&#xa0;\nUK Food Group submissionDecember 20131\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe UK Food Group welcomes the opportunity to make \nthis\n submission to the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Com\nmons Select Committee’s (EFRA) \ni\nnquiry on ‘food security’. \nThe UK Food Group is the main network of NGOs in the UK working on global food, agriculture and hunger issues, including development, environment, farmer, consumer and academic groups. \n2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis submission is structured according to\n \nquestions posed in the inquiry\n’s terms of reference\n. It\n cover\ns the first four of the\nse\n questions\n, with \nsome of the issues \nraised in\n the second set of four questions dealt with\n implicitly\n.\n3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nKey points that we wish to highlight are:\n4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n•\n              \nThe impact of UK domest\nic food security policies and practices on international food security policies and practices, and vice versa, \nis\n of critical importance\n to securing future food\n. \nA\n food system characterised by an\n industrial model of agriculture\n, a global market in which a \nfew companies hold concentrated market power\n,\n and \nlong unaccountable\n supply chain\ns\n \nis vulnerable to shocks\n, damages the environment and\n can seriously reduce\n the capacity of\n food \nproducers\n,\n especially small-scale\n producers, to \nprovide healthy and delicious \nfood and achieve the right to food\n.\n \n5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n•\n              \nGM crops have not provided yield improvements\n and\n do not provide any nutritional advantage that cannot better be realised\n through\n biodiverse food production. \nThey are promoted as a result of proprietary interests\n.\n6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n•\n              \nB\niodiverse and ecological \napproaches\n of small-scale food providers\n, \nadapted to local circumstances and control\nled democratically\n, are more resilient to climate change and other \neconomic and social pressures\n. Th\nis\n offers the potential for a\n \nfairer food syste\nm that could eradicate hunge\nr and restore the environment.\n \nIt would also\n safeguard the genetic basis for future \nplant breeding and \nadaptation \nto a changing climate\n. \n7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n•\n              \nB\nuilding on\n the \nsuccessful \nprocesses used in th\ne\n UN Committee on Wo\nr\nld Food Security (CF\nS)\n,\n \nthe UK \ncould strive to be more inclusive in its normative processes\n relating to food provision. It could invite\n r\nepresentatives of small-scale food producers\n networks, particularly those linked with La Ví\na Campesina, the international peasant movement,\n \nto participate \nin UK decision making forums\n.\n8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNational food security in the UK, as well as European food security can only be secured by achieving global food securit\ny. \nFood security\n should be measured in terms of\n availability\n,\n affordability\n, nutritional value\n and \nthe resilience and \nsustainability \nof these three over time\n. \nGovernments, including the UK’s, have a legal obligation\n in the Right to Food\n to \nprogressively \nreach a point where food security\n for all\n is achieved. \nThis includes ‘extraterritorial obligations’ to be aware of any impact of the UK’s national policies elsewhere in the world and to take action to prevent them causing any damage.\n9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPolicy approaches for \nachieving th\ne Right to Food\n. Global networks\n and social movements of small-scale food producers, including farmers, pastoralists, fisherfolk and indigenous people, have defined their own \npolicy \nvision for the food system \nas\n the framework of food sovereign\nty:\n10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n“Food sovereignty is the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods, and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems. It puts the aspirations and needs of tho\nse who produce, distribute and consume food at the heart of food systems and policies rather than the demands of markets and corporations.”\n11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe world already produces enough food to be able to feed everybody.\n It is over a decade since the then UN Special \nRapporteur on the Right to Food, Jean Ziegler, noted that the world already produced enough food to feed 12 billion people,\n and food production has increased since then.\n The problem is access to food and the means for its production.\n Increasing productio\nn, per se, will not alter levels of hunger, if those who are food insecure or are malnourished continue to be unable to afford adequate nutritious food: reducing poverty is the most effective way to improve food security. \nOne aspect of this is policies to \nsupport the ability of \nsmall-scale farmers, in the UK as well as elsewhere in the world, to make decent living.\n12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSupport for biodiverse small\n-\nscale and ecological producers is vital for UK and EU food security because genetic diversity is critical for resil\nience to pests and other challenges which are likely to get worse with climate change. The Irish potato famine was caused by Ireland’s dependence on very few varieties of potato – making the crop very susceptible to disease. \nIndigenous and local plant vari\neties\n in the field continue to evolve and adapt to environmental change unlike those in gene banks, making them more resilient. Thus, centres of genetic diversity\n,\n \nsuch as potatoes in the Andes,\n are important for the UK and EU’s food security and economy.\n13\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTwo \nUK and EU \npolicies that have damaging effects on food security are:\n•\n              \nbiofuels subsidies, which promote \nproduction of non-food commodities and undermine\n food provision\n•\n              \nrestrictive measures and technologies that reduce Farmers’ Rights to sow, use, exc\nhange and sell their seeds\nSome further drivers of food insecurity are discussed in more detail below.\n14\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe majority of agricultural resources are not currently used to feed people, but instead are either used for animal feed, \nagrofuels and other industrial commodities, or produce foods that are wasted. A redirection of these resources towards producing food for direct human consumption, in ways that are socially and environmentally sustainable would secure future food provision\n both in the UK and internationally\n15\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nModern intensive a\ngriculture faces many environmental problems – soil degradation and erosion, water pollution and excess demand for irrigation, loss of agricultural biodiversity. In addition it faces social problems – l\noss of rural jobs and livelihoods and undermining of local \nand traditional knowledge of ecosystem management\n, sustainable agriculture and genetic resources for food and agriculture\n. \n16\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn response to these food, equity and e\nnvironmental challenges, the UN/\nWorld Bank-sponsored International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD) recommended that:\n“An increase and strengthening of AKST [agricultural knowledge, science and technology] towards agroecological scienc\nes will contribute to addressing environmental issues while maintaining and increasing productivity\n.\n”\n17\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAgroecology is explained by UN Special Rapporteur \non\n the Right to Food, Olivier De Schutter as follows:\n“Agroecology is both a science and a set of pract\nices. It was created by the convergence of two scientific disciplines: agronomy and ecology. As a science, agroecology is the “application of ecological science to the study, design and management \nof sustainable agroecosystems.\n” \nAs a set of agricultural pr\nactices, agroecology seeks ways to enhance agricultural systems by mimicking natural processes, thus creating beneficial biological interactions and synergies among the components of the agroecosystem. It provides the most favourable soil conditions for pl\nant growth, particularly by managing organic matter and by raising soil biotic activity. The core principles of agroecology include recycling nutrients and energy on the farm, rather than introducing external inputs; integrating crops and livestock; divers\nifying species and genetic resources in agroecosystems over time and space; and focusing on interactions and productivity across the agricultural system, rather than focusing on individual species. Agroecology is highly knowledge-intensive, based on techni\nques that are not delivered top-down but developed on the basis of farmers’ knowledge and experimentation.”\n \n18\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInvestment and support in strengthening \nand protecting \nagroecological farming by small-scale food producers, in the framew\nork of food sovereignty, has the most potential for supporting livelihoods and rural communities, reducing poverty, \nensuring access to food for vulnerable groups, \ncreating resilient food systems, enabling people to have a healthy diet and regenerating the \nenvironment. \nThis in turn is important for enhancing peace, stability and prosperity worldwide.\n19\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe UK Government, as a member of the CFS, is party to the negotiations for the principles for responsible agricultural investment in the context of food securi\nty and nutrition\n (\nrai\n)\n that are currently underway at the UN Committee on World Food Security (CFS)\n. The CFS is\n forum that brings together not only member states but also civil society, the private sector, research networks, other UN bodies and philanthrop\nic organisations\n and\n is the foremost international platform for work toward the elimination of hunger and ensuring food security and nutrition for everyone. The UK could provide increased support for developing investment principles in the CFS that will bu\nild on the investments made by small-scale food providers themselves both in the UK and internationally. \n20\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is important to recognize the role of food waste in \nundermining\n food security. Every step of \nthe food chain\n has certain losses or waste \nassociated. \nA small propo\nr\ntion\n of that waste is unavoidable and intrinsic to the product (e.g. non edible portions of fruit and vegetables), whereas \na much larger proportion\n is avoidable and usually related to inefficient systems or market and cultural res\ntrictions. \nEstimates suggest that between one third and one half of global food production is thrown away, wasting not only the food but also all the energy and resources that have gone into producing that food.\n \nSome of the major culprits of food waste are\n inadequate storage and transport infrastructure, irresponsible consumption (buying more than is needed) and restrictive selection rules (as in the case of fruits that are only accepted by retailers if the fit some predetermined aesthetic characteristics).\n An\nother aspect of food waste that i\ns usually not discussed is the one represented by the inefficiency of feeding human edible crops to animals instead\n of directly to people.\n21\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA\nn eminently sensible\n measure that could both reduce waste and use existing resou\nrces more efficiently has been put forward by the Pig Idea \npolicy campaign\n \nwith their proposal to reintroduce the conversion of food waste into feed for pig production, using approved cooking processes that render it safe for use as feed by killing any \npathogens present such as foot and mouth disease and classical swine fever. DEFRA is encouraged to work with the Pig Idea and BPEX to implement this initiative, already common in other countries such as Japan, South Korea, China and many states in the USA\n.\n \nThis would not only reduce the financial costs of meat production (animal feed costs have gone up markedly over recent years), but also greatly reduce the demand for very large amounts of soya and other crops for animal food, which in turn have enormous s\nocial and environmental impacts during production and processing – such as\n land dispossessions and conflicts, high levels of\n water and fertiliser use\n,\n a\nnd wide-spread forest clearance\n particularly in tropical ar\neas.\n22\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBilateral and international trade \nagreements can undermine food security. Excluding elements in the agreements and negotiations that impact on food provision is demanded by the social movements of the world’s food providers \n23\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSince the WTO's Agreement on Agriculture came into force in 1995,\n unequal powers are distorting food trade, and a few multinational agribusinesses have increased their domination of global input supply, trade and food distribution.\n Conflict between \nWTO rules and food security have been highlighted at the recent WTO Mini\nsterial in Bali, without resolution other than in a temporary ‘peace clause’.\n There are deep concerns about current EU trade negotiations with the USA and Canada. The possible Trans-Atlantic Trade Agreement risks undermining the UK’s (and EU’s) ability to \ncontrol its own food system. \n24\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThese negotiations should be fully transparent. As the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy has emphasised, \n“the TTIP negotiations should result in an agreement that prohibits—rather than promotes—efforts by corporation\ns to play off regulatory standards in one jurisdiction against the other. Those dialogues should hold open the possibility that the best avenues for progress could be outside the constraints of trade rules, as happened with the recent U.S.-EU agreement on \norganic standards. Proposals to broaden the definition of investment to apply to SPS and financial market regulations, making \nthem subject to challenge under investor-state dispute resolution, should be firmly rejected\n.\n”\n \n25\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe relationship between the price of food and what farmers receive for producing it has become increasingly disconnected. In a trend that started at the end of the last century, most of the money spent on food purcha\nses goes to non-farmers. It is estimated that UK farmers receive only 9p of every £1 spent on food\n.\n \nAccording to \nDEFRA’s own figures\n, \nfarmers\n’\n income\n \nfell\n by 1\n3\n% \nbetween 2011\n and \n2012.\n Over this same period, the profits of the big\ngest\n s\neven\n supermarkets \nrose to £7.6bn\n.\n The market power of intermediaries enables them to influence both farm-gate and consumer prices to their benefit.\n26\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe relationship between price and production is also affected by:\n27\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n•\n              \nglobal market which links local market prices to factors\n affecting prices in other parts of the world\n28\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n•\n              \nlink to oil prices through mechanisation, chemical inputs and biofuel production\n, which is further complicated by fossil fuel subsidies\n29\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n•\n              \nwaste (see above)\n30\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nQuality food production, with enhanced incomes for farmers, could be encouraged with incentives for providing ecosystem services and for using agroecological approaches for localised food systems that provide multiple benefits for society. Facilitating dis\ntribution of food through \nf\nair\n t\nrade and similar mechanisms to protect the prices paid and the working conditions of food producers, would further enhance incomes\n31\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSimultaneously, consumer prices for industrially produced foods could better reflect the true\n costs of production\n and also the costs of treating diet related ill health.\n \nMethods for\n internalising the externalities of production and consumption \ninclude\n differential taxing for products and production systems with high negative impacts on health and \nthe environment, creating a disincentive. \nT\nhe revenue generated\n could be used\n to subsidise foods with positive health and environmental impacts, \nsuch as UK-grown fruit and vegetables or\n healthy and sustainable school meals\n.\n32\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLocally resilient food systems, incorporating adequate stocks of foods, can mitigate food price volatility. In contrast, the global industrialised commodity regime can exacerbate volatility. It is contro\nlled by a handful of corporations that dominate the development and marketing of inputs (agrochemicals, seed varieties and livestock genetics), commercialisation of products, transport, trade and retail. They may redirect investments towards agrofuels, cel\nlulose production, livestock feed or other commodities as subsidy \nregimes change and market opportunities arise, affecting prices and volatility in the global supply of crops.\n33\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUK food self-sufficiency has declined rapidly in the past two and\n \na\n \nhalf decades\n, from almost 80% in 1984 to the current 60%. Even locally produced food in the UK is highly dependent on imports for feed and fertilizer. Food insecurity in the world will impact the UK. The demand for land to produce crops for other uses presents a serio\nus risk to food security and greater vulnerability to shocks. \n34\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is now generally agreed that the EU biofuels targets and the use of land to produce crops to feed animals, to name a few, affect food prices and \navailab\nility. \nG\nrowing livestock feed for i\nndu\nstrial livestock production, \nin the service of\n an unhealthy increase in meat and dairy production, has significant impacts on food price volatility and availability.\n35\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSpeculation in commodity futures markets is creating volatile price movements that do not \nreflect true changes in demand and supply. Position limits were used effectively in the US for most of the twentieth century to prevent market manipulation and excessive speculation, and are used on markets in Australia, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, China \nand South Africa today. They are transparent and give traders legal certainty. The introduction of position limits could be a reduction in the opportunity cost of excessive speculation, through the diversion of capital into genuine, productive investment. \nOn the issue of liquidity, the argument that position limits, if set too low, could damage liquidity for hedgers is redundant when current levels of financial speculation are so far above historic norms. The UK’s current self-regulatory approach has a trac\nk record of failure and creates conflicts of interest and a regulatory race-to-the-bottom.\n \n36\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPublic procurement of food can be a tool to tackle both increasing levels of food poverty and lack of support for small-scale farmers. \nFor example over the past 15\n years Brazil has shifted \npublic food procurement from an industriali\ns\ned and centrali\ns\ned system to a locali\ns\ned farm system\n, improving the quality of school meals while reducing the ecological footprint\n.\n The EU Food Links project has developed an action pl\nan for public procurement with environmental, social/health and economic indicators, which could inform UK policy.\n \n  \n37\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGM crops have not provided yield improvements, are \nmainly developed for industrial commodity production, and facilitate increased concentration of power over agriculture by biotech corporations. They do not provide any nutritional advantage that cannot better be realised through diverse diets provided by b\niodiverse food production. They have no role in any part of the solution for a sustainable and equitable food system in the UK or elsewhere. With regard to biotechnological research and development, the Precautionary Principle / Approach should prevail.\n38\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGe\nnetically modifie\nd\n crops are frequently put forward as an essential tool for securing food supply in the future\n.\n However, despite four decades of development GM crops, only two GM traits, herbicide tolerance and insect resistance(Bt), in mainly soya, maiz\ne, oilseed rape and cotton account, for about 99% of the GM crops grown commercially, predominantly used for animal feed , agrofuels and fibre production.\n39\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHerbicide tolerance (HT) and insect resistance (IR) are relative simple traits to genetically enginee\nr because they only code for additional novel proteins within the plant.  These are agronomic traits which produce some short-term savings for farmers until weeds and insects developed resistance to the herbicides and the Bt toxins. There is no evidence th\nat the addition of these GM traits has improved crop yields as compared with non-GM varieties. Indeed a comparison of maize and oilseed rape yield in predominantly GM USA and predominantly non-GM EU showed that the former has lagged behind in terms of annu\nal yield increment since th\ne advent of commercial GM crops.\n40\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMetabolic changes, intended and unintended, in GM crops raise the possibility of harmful changes taking place which require detailed assessment during risk assessments before crops can be approve\nd to enter the food/feed chain. In addition, the direct application of herbicides on GM HT crops will increase exposure to toxic residues in the end food/feed product.\n41\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMore complex traits such as genes to produce beta carotene (for instance in Golden Rice)\n, drought tolerance, saline tolerance and nitrogen fixation have proved to be much more difficult to develop because they seek to alter the metabolism of crop plants in a way that may have unexpected consequences in other biochemical pathways of the receiv\ning plants.\n42\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGolden Rice cannot deliver the required amounts of vitamin A to people of a nutrient poor diet. The low levels of fat and oil in diets of poor people will also limit the conversion efficiency into Vitamin A. In the case of GM nitrogen-fixing ce\nreals, little progress has been made over the last three decades. To achieve this objective, both the plant and N fixing bacterium have to be genetically modified to form a symbiotic relationship. It is worth noting that during evolutionary history, grass/\ncereal species have never naturally evolved nitrogen fixing. The reason for this may lie in the high energy requirement for fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere which would divert significant amounts of sugars in cereals away for other functions such as gra\nin formation. The consequence may be lower yield\ns.\n \n43\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe combination of advance traditional plant breeding techniques (such as marker assisted selection) and using agroecological approaches for the natural re-building of soil f\nertility using crops rotation\ns,\n N-fixing crops such as clover and beans, crop rotations and efficient cycling of plant nutrients from the waste stream offer a quicker, surer, more efficient and environmentally sounder way forward than GM in protected varieties of crops containing elit\ne genes. Developing diverse varieties and populations, grown in crop/livestock mixed production will improve resilience and sustain yields in all conditions\n as well as\n increas\ning\n access to the diverse diets needed to prevent the malnutrition \nwhich \nproducts\n such as Golden Rice are supposed to tackle\n. These methods are included in agroecological approaches to food production.\n44\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA key part of successful agroecological approaches is formed by policies and practices that will sustain agricultural biodiversity. Thi\ns is generated by and underpins agroecological production systems. Agricultural biodiversity comprises the diversity of seeds, plants, livestock breeds and fish and other aquatic organisms used for food and of the associated pollinators, pest predators and\n soil organisms. Agricultural biodiversity is the component of biodiversity that has been developed by and has co-evolved with people, and it underpins the food system and the wider economy, human health, the security of food supplies, and the viability of\n the biosphere. It is therefore essential to regulate, transform or prohibit any systems, methods, processes or technologies, which might damage or restrict agricultural biodiversity \nand\n its related ecosystem functions. In order to develop agricultural bio\ndiversity, priority should be given to in situ conservation and development of domesticated species on-\nfarm, on the range and in rivers, ponds and lakes, by small-scale food producers, respecting their Farmers’\n Rights\n and related\n rights\n.\n \n45\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs mentioned abo\nve the IAASTD report recommended strengthening \nagricultural kn\nowledge, science and technology\n towards agroecological sciences\n. The UK is a signatory to the IAASTD reports. The UK could set an example globally by redirecting its science efforts from providi\nng research in support of industrial commodity production towards agroecological approaches that support localised food regimes\n46\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is thus an imperative for the UK government to re-direct R&amp;D and UKAid funding towards agroecological research and develop\nment which is \ndriven by the needs of farmers\n and small scale producers, as expressed by their social movements. Only 1% of public agricultural investment on research is allocated to agro-ecological projects while GM projects receive 15% of the funding\n.\n  \nD\nespite the rhetoric, the BIS AgriTech strategy will do little to address this imbalance and help realise food security. Instead a swift reversal of \nthe UK \ngovernment’s research investm\nents by the BBSRC, and Defra, \nand DFID’s investment in the CGIAR and oth\ner national, regional and international research activities is required, so that agroecological approaches, developed in the framework of food sovereignty, receive the majority of the funding. \n47\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSimilarly there is a need to ensure that the research outcomes\n can be taken up by farmers through well-funded and well-designed public extension services both in the UK and other regions. The direct involvement of farmers in training other farmers in improved agroecological techniques is a proven means to achieve thi\ns. \n48\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA series of guiding questions to help determine whether an agricultural system, small-scale or large-scale, contributes to sustainable livelihoods has been outlined by some leading academic thinkers\n.\n Responding to tho\nse questions \nin the\n context of the UK food system c\nould be a useful exercise for the EFRA committee\n.\n49\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nShould the EFRA committee require further information on the points raised, the UK Food Group would be pleased to provide this.\n&#xa0;\n \n              \nLa Vía Campesina, the international movement of peasants, small and medium scale farmers, has 150 member organizations in 70 countries from Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas, and altogether represents about\n 200 million farmers.\n \n              \nDeclaration of Nyéléni\n, \nSélingué, Mali\n, February 2007. \nwww.nyeleni.org/IMG/pdf/DeclNyeleni-en.pdf\n \n \n              \nCommission on Human Rights, \nThe right to food: report by the \nSpecial Rapporteur on the right to food, Mr. Jean Ziegler\n. \nE/CN.4/2001/53\n.
