[[[ of female sports participation]]]Premier League Schools Tournament (PLST)“ From being picked up from school, to arriving in Liverpool, staying in the hotel and having meals together as a team, getting to the stadium, going down the Anfield tunnel and having their photos taken with the Barclays Premier League trophy, the girls have loved it. Doing it here at Anfield, with its history and the great things that have happened here is special."There has been a real buzz at the school this week. We’ve had 50 kids come over today to support. It has helped us to sell football to girls at the school and even today a couple of girls watching said to me that they would like to join and when does it start again. It is one of those where success breeds success.""My role is about developing girls' football so it was just brilliant when coming here to have the first thing I see are four pitches of girls playing the game. The standard looks really good. The organisation of the tournament has been fantastic and truly professional."I am just really pleased that girls get the chance to play on this fantastic pitch at the same time as the boys do. They are getting the same opportunities, which is exactly what we want. There are some really good players and what is really impressive is that the girls’ game is improving every year. You can see that here each year."Premier League 4 Sport (PL4S)"It's brilliant to get girls involved in sport especially from netball's perspective. It's great to have the community projects that have a football team so they can feel a part of something. "It will help to get more girls playing because our drop-out rate starts when they leave school and it's all about keeping them engaged with these projects. We're hoping that this is the link, this will help and the more money that is pumped into it the more girls that can get involved."Derby County’s ‘The Movement’ projectMore info: http://www.derbycountycommunitytrust.com/the-movement/about.html
