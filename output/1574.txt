[[[ (WSC024)]]]&#xa0;Summary&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Introduction&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Why do women leave STEMM academia?&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;What are the consequences?&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Or negative:&#xa0;&#xa0;What should universities do to retain women in academia?&#xa0;13.              To retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers, universities and the higher education sector could consider one or more of the following: &#xa0;a.              Provide more effective appraisal and mentoring, and associated training for both employees and their line managers&#xa0;b.              Improve resourcing of careers services, and recognize science-related jobs as viable career options&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;See also point 15 below.Are there examples of good practice?&#xa0;14.              Many Universities, including Cambridge, and their constituent Departments, are Athena SWAN charter members. The Athena SWAN award system recognizes good practice relating both to Gender Equality, and to creating a culture that is more likely to retain talented individuals, especially women.&#xa0;15.              Examples of good practice within our School of Medicine include:&#xa0;a.              Development of a Senior Academic Women’s Forum&#xa0;b.              Establishment of a group of mentors for female clinical academic trainees&#xa0;c.              Regular career development and confidence-building workshops for mid-career women&#xa0;d.              Initiation of a “Returning Carer’s Fund” to provide financial support for any activity that mid-career Academics and Researchers who have taken care leave for three months or more believe will re-energise their careers&#xa0;e.              School-wide increase in Equality and Diversity awareness and training&#xa0;f.              Ensuring that appointments panels and committees have female representation (we do not impose a particular percentage to avoid adversely impacting on women’s time commitment to such activities)&#xa0;g.              Increasing visibility of senior academic women via seminar speakers, chairing responsibilities, and a regular school-wide newsletter&#xa0;h.              Ensuring that women are as well supported as men in promotions processes.&#xa0;&#xa0;What can the Government do?&#xa0;16.              We believe that Government can play a role in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers, which can be both financial and practical, in the following areas:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;August 2013&#xa0; McNeil and Sher: http://www.physics.wm.edu/~sher/survey.html Moss-Racusin CA, et al.
