[[[ociety of Editors – Written evidence]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The Society of Editors has more than 400 members in national, regional and local newspapers, broadcasting, digital media, media law and journalism education. It is the only organisation representing editors and senior executives in all sectors of the media. It was founded in 1999 as the result of a merger of the Guild of Editors and the Association of British Editors. It campaigns on press freedom issues, the public’s right to know, freedom of expression and media standards.&#xa0;The Society of Editors supports a more detailed response from Santha Rasaiah at the Newspaper Society. Along with the Newspaper Society’s response the Society of Editors also objects to proposals to remove statutory requirements to ensure the publication of public notices in local newspapers, and that certain evidence is heard in the criminal court.&#xa0;We are also concerned that assurance has yet to be given that production applications and police search and seizure orders properly safeguard journalistic material and confidential sources. &#xa0;The proposals to end newspaper publication of various public notices in favour of local authority websites are yet to be justified and does not take into account the lack of internet access in certain sections of the population and the impact upon local communities. Research by the Newspaper Society has established that the reach of local newspapers was much greater than council websites with 67% of respondents saying that they had looked at their local newspaper for a couple of minutes in the last seven days compared with 9% who had viewed the council website. &#xa0;Furthermore it should be remembered that many people see notices in newspapers simply as a result of browsing. They may therefore find information about which they had no prior or knowledge or concern but which could affect their lives. It should not be assumed that people either regularly or occasionally search council websites or indeed use the internet routinely. It is only in newspapers that they are likely to see official notices unless they already had awareness and perhaps concern. &#xa0;Our concerns also centre on a proposed amendment of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 Section 9 to remove statutory provisions requiring written statements to be read aloud or an oral account to be given in court. Alongside this we object strongly to proposals which remove statutory safeguards for journalistic material under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, Terrorism Act 2000, Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 and Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. Given recent events relating to the NSA disclosures by The Guardian newspaper there is already concern about the use of police powers under PACE and counter- terrorism legislation and other measures in relation to obtaining material and information from journalists. We would therefore be hopeful that these provisions are omitted. &#xa0;&#xa0;16 September 2013
