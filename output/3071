defaultAt a HA presentation on 16 Oct 2013 in Brampton– the village worst affected by the HA proposals – Brampton A14 Campaign Group (BCG) also presented their alternative scheme which had previously been submitted to the HA prior to the 2010 Public Inquiry (BCG scheme outline at

defaultAn illustration of the impact of the 2010 HA scheme at Brampton is at

defaultre them for public consultation. 
defaultNothing further was heard from the HA and the
defaultir 
defaultscheme was cancelled in 
defaultOctober 
default2010.  
defaultBCG also submitted suggestions to the ‘A14 challenge’ in 2011, including a Park &amp; Ride at Brampton Racecourse to reduce car traffic on the A14.  This could be linked with the guided bus route (currently ends at Huntingdon rail station).  A new local shuttle bus service between  the Park &amp; Ride, Brampton village, the rail station and 
defaultHinchingbrooke
default Hospital in Huntingdon was also proposed to relieve peak hour car traffic on local roads. This also seems to have disappeared without trace.
default              
defaultComment: Under Treasury rules the Highways Agency is supposed to evaluate alternative proposals but has failed to do so.

defaultClientEarthdefault triumph in the Supreme CourtdefaultWednesday 1
defaultst
default May 2013 was a good day for air quality. A legal battle which began in 2011 has resulted in a formal ruling from the highest court in the land that the Government is failing in its legal duty to protect people from the harmful effects of air pollution.
defaultSome of the complex legal questions will be referred to the European Court of Justice to inform the Supreme Court’s decision on a course of action. This will inevitably cause some delay, but going to the European Court means that any decision will then have implications for all EU Member States. The declaration also means that ‘the way is open to immediate enforcement action at national or European level’. See the 
defaultsummary
default and 
defaultfull judgment
default for more detail.
defaultIt’s also provided an interesting opportunity to examine 
defaultDefra’s
default tendency to stick their fingers in their ears over this problem. Even on the same day that the Supreme Court made their declaration, a Government source was widely quoted in the media as saying: “Air quality has improved significantly in recent decades and almost all of the UK meets EU air quality limits for all pollutants.” That’s government terminology for “la la 
defaultla
default not listening”, surely?
defaultAlan Andrews, 
defaultClientEarth
default lawyer, said: “It’s misleading to say that almost all of the UK meets EU air quality limits. Much of the UK land mass has a low population. Air pollution is a problem in cities where most people live. If you’re on holiday in the Highlands you’re at a low risk. If you grow up in an inner city it could do you irreversible and life threatening damage. If we’re going to solve this problem the first thing the Government needs to do is be honest about air pollution’s scale and impact.”
defaultWe’ll be working through the full implications of this landmark decision by the Supreme Court and particularly how this might help local communities to get traction on the issue in the short term. Watch this space, but for now, see the press release
