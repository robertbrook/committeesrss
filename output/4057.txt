[[[ and as Technical Director of J. ]]]

[[[Brand (BRC 51)]]]&#xa0;

[[[Introduction.]]]My name is Tim Oldershaw, and I am the Technical Director of an electrical installation company based in London. I have been an electrician for 35 years and have seen the status of a “professional” been lowered and defused over the years in the UK. This has not happened across Europe, where a qualified electrician still has standing and legal requirements. I feel very passionate about safety and quality, as I believe these go hand in hand. There is nothing sadder than to hear that someone has been hurt or killed by a sub-standard electrical installation which should have been picked up and fixed by the correct implementation of testing and the basic good practise of the Standards (BS7671 etc.).&#xa0;

[[[Part P]]]When part P was announced I was very pleased and thought it would be as strong as the “safe gas” installers system. As it was introduced it became clear it was not, it was a watered down licencing system. But as it was rolled out and contractors began to join the ECA, NICEIC and other schemes it really started to have an impact, with lots of one man bands, and small company’s joining and actually testing installations in both the domestic and the commercial area. We have also seen a great improvement in the awareness of specifiers and consumers to insist on a “Part P” registered installer and a registered certificate on completion.&#xa0;The small installers have been dragged to the standards, by the new Part P, but when the have found them, they see that if all installers have to comply they are not put at a financial disadvantage, and are only too pleased to do quality, safe work.&#xa0;The problem is still the rogue traders and DIY installers who love to quote the “competent person” quip, “I said I am competent there for I am a “competent person” and so I am legally allowed to do electrical installations. I don’t need any expensive qualifications; I have been to the school of life.”&#xa0;Unfortunately legally they are correct. But how is a specifier or consumers to tell what qualifications are relevant, or needed by an installer? Some of the rogue traders have been saying they are Part P but not with one of the big schemes, but with a small group, (which really does not exist). This is where we come to the rescue with the ESR (Electrical Safety Register). This is the list of all the approved electricians, and companies, from multiple schemes which a consumer or specifier can check to see if the contractor really is qualified.What this needs is ESR to be promoted to specifiers and consumers with a publicity campaign, stressing that this is the safe way to have work done.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
