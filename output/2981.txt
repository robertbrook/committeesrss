[[[ [WAS0042]]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;As the local representative, I write on behalf of the WIBF, a long established World promoter and sanctioning authority for women's professional boxing.&#xa0;My experience, based over 40 years, is that whilst matters have undoubtedly improved in the recognition, and the ability to participate in women’s boxing, there is still considerable prejudice and opposition in the U.K which prevents women from fighting and earning a living.&#xa0;They are unable to have the opportunity to earn the large prize money available to the men.&#xa0;Our former World flyweight champion REGINA HALMICH was able to become a millionairess in Germany where she attracted television audiences of over 5 million viewers on the ZDF TV channel.&#xa0;This opportunity is not open to British women because the BBC and SKY television channels will not televise their fights. We consider this to be sexual discrimination.&#xa0;Similarly there is discrimination against women’s boxing in the print media.&#xa0;I have experienced cases where SKY televised all the men's bouts at York Hall, Bethnall Green London, but deliberately omitted to screen the sole women's bout. The next day the published results in the Daily Telegraph omitted the women's bout!&#xa0;Without the oxygen of publicity, which television and the major print media should provide, promoters will not give women work.&#xa0;I enclose a copy of an article from The Yorkshire Evening Post Newspaper of Friday 2nd, February 2001 (OVER 12 YEARS AGO !) recording the Meeting which one of our World Title Challengers, MICHELLE SUTCLIFFE from Leeds had with the then Minister for Sport KATE HOEY MP in an attempt to overcome the sexual discrimination which still persists.
