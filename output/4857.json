"              \n              \nWritten evidence submitted by CST [CT 01]Letter from Richard Benson, Chief Executive, CST, to the Chair of the Committee, 14 June 2013&#xa0;In response to your request for information concerning extremist speakers at UK universities for the Home Affairs Committee’s inquiry into international terrorism and crime, please find attached CST’s submission.\nAs you will see, we are aware of several incidences of extremist sp\neakers and antisemitic incident\ns at UK universities that affect the well being of both Jewish students and the wider student community. \n&#xa0;\nRichard Benson\n, \nChief Executive\nCST\nJune 2013\n&#xa0;BACKGROUND TRENDS&#xa0;\nBritish campuses are generally places where Jewish students feel safe to study and do not \nsuffer \nantisemitism on a daily basis. However, \nthere are occasions at some Universities and Students’ Unions when Jewish\n students have been exposed to hate preachers, \nextremist\n groups, radicalised individuals\n, disruption of Jewish Society events and even \ndirect incidents of antisemitism.\n Extremist activity can leave students from a range of minorities feeling vulnerable and reluctant to express their identity openly. Antisemitism, when it occurs, often takes place in a context that includes other forms of bigotry and as such targets all minority students, and therefore the student body as a whole. \n&#xa0;\nThis academic year (2012-13) has seen an increase in far right activity on campus. Some of this increase\n is part of a cycle of extremism between far right and Islamist extremists\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;ISLAMIST SPEAKERS:&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAl-Haddad is the chairman of \nLondon’s \nMuslim Research and Development Foundation, a\n group \nthat gives Sharia advice on financial matters.\n \nAl-Haddad has been embroiled in controversy surrounding comments allegedly made in 2001 where it is alleged that he claimed Jews \n“a\nre the enemies of God and descendants of apes and pigs”.\n \nHe has persistent\nly denied making those comments.\n An English-language article by Al-Haddad opposes the actions of Al Qaeda but explains that regardless of what Osama bin Laden did, or did not do, “\nit is an established part of our Islamic \ncreed that every Muslim, unlike the disbelievers, will eventually enter paradise\n”. The article also shows various perspectives on what constitutes a “martyr” in combat between Muslims and non-Muslims\n.\n Speaking in English, Al-Haddad may be seen on youtube, discussing “why marriages fail”. This includes his saying that no outsider should ask a husband why he is beating his wife, because such matters should be sorted between the couple.\n&#xa0;\n              \nIn February 2010, Tamimi was a speaker at the Federation of Student Islamic Society (FOSIS) Palestine Conference\n held at Manchester University, an Islamic Society event at Cambridge\n and a Palestinian Society event at SOAS.\n During his address to SOAS students, Tamimi called for the destruction of Israel and stated,\n“Today Hamas is considered a terrorist organisation because that’s what the Americans and Israelis and cowardly politicians of Europe want, but what is so terrorist about it? \n“You shouldn’t be afraid of being labelled extreme, radical or terrorist. If fighting for your home land is terrorism, I take pride in being a terrorist. The Koran tells me if I die for my homeland, I’m a martyr and I long to be a martyr.”\n.\nIn November 2004, Tamimi told the BBC’s \nHardtalk\n: \n&#xa0;\n“If I can go to \nPalestine\n and sacrifice myself I would do it. Why not?...sacrificing myself for \nPalestine\n is a noble cause. It is the straight way to pleasing my God and I would\n do it if I had the opportunity\n”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nUthman Lateef is a preacher from the Hittin Institute.\n Lateef \nis alleged to have said, “we don’t accept homosexuality...we hate it because Allan hates it”.\n \nIn January and June 2009, Lateef \nwas an advertised speaker \nat events where Anwar Al-Awlaki \n(a senior Al-Qaeda figure, later killed by a US drone strike) \ngave presentations via video link.\n \n&#xa0;\n              \nFAR RIGHT ACTIVITY ON CAMPUS&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nAlthough the disruption of Israel-related events \nmay not be \nantisemitic\n per se\n, it contributes to an environment of tension, hostility and discomfort for Jewish students; often resulting in Jewish students feeling intimidated and \nunable to express their views or identities\n on their own campus.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nThroughout 2012, there were a total of 32 campus-related antisemitic incidents reported to the CST.\n Of these, 18 took place on campus and 14 affected students or academics off campus. Below are some examples:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Hizb ut-Tahrir&#xa0;\nHizb ut-Tahrir is an Islamist organisation that has a record of offensive and inflammatory statements regarding Jews, non-Muslims, \nand \ngay people\n, amongst others. \n \nThey \nwere added to the NUS No Platform policy in 2004, which denies them the ability to be involved with the national union. However\n,\n this policy only has an advisory \ncapacity for individual Students’\n Unions. Since then, the organisation has regained \nsome of its p\nresence on campus\n via front-groups\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nMuslim Public Affairs Committee:&#xa0;\nThe Muslim Public Affairs Committee (MPAC) \nwebsite includes anti-Zionist conspiracy theorising. \nIn 2006\n, \nAs\ngh\nar Bukhari, a found\ner\n of MPAC and its spokesman, \nwas shown to have \ngiven money to \nHolocaust revisionist, \nDavid Irving in 2000\n;\n and \nurged others to do likewise\n.\n Bukhari stated this was because he had regarded Irving as “anti-Zionist”. In 2004, the National Union of Students described MPAC as antisemitic and banned the group.\n&#xa0;\nFollowing the presence of MPAC at Middlesex University, the Students’ Union held a referendum to reaffirm the Union’s policy of not providing a platform for individuals with racist or fascist views (26\nth\n-27\nth\n February 2013) which received 73% voting yes.\n  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCST\nJune 2013\n&#xa0;\n4\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5b0V49VusY\n \nhttp://www2.lse.ac.uk/publicEvents/events/2012/02/20120207t1830vCLM502.aspx\n \nhttp://www.familyretreat.co.uk/speakers/shaykh-dr-haitham-al-haddad/\n \nhttp://www.mrdf.co.uk/\n \n \nhttp://www.rnw.nl/english/article/cleric-did-say-\"jews-are-descendants-apes-and-pigs\"\n \nhttp://www.alminbar.net/alkhutab/khutbaa.asp?mediaURL=4359\n \nhttp://hurryupharry.org/2012/02/04/more-wisdom-of-haitham-al-haddad/\n \nhttp://www.islam21c.com/politics/2644-advice-to-muslims-on-the-death-of-osama-bin-ladin\n See from 9:\n00 minutes \nfor relevant comments \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=z37H-NuyY1c\n, \n \nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/jan/07/iraq.comment\n \nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/nov/21/israel-palestine-gaza\n \nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/280300288948/\n \nhttp://www.tcs.cam.ac.uk/issue/news/university-islamic-society-accused-of-hypocrisy/\n \nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/271049642285/\n \nhttp://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/27106/calls-destruction-israel-soas-lecture\n \nHardtalk\n, BBC News 24, 2/11/04\n, \nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/hardtalk/3985403.stm\n \nhttp://www.reading.ac.uk/news-and-events/releases/PR490014.aspx\n \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHEaL6Fs7RA\n \nhttp://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/andrewgilligan/100077810/east-london-mosque-keeps-on-lying/\n \n  \nhttp://theendoftime.eventbrite.com/\n \n \nhttp://www.hurryupharry.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/wasatiyyah.jpeg\n \nhttp://corkindependent.com/stories/item/7110/2012-4/Nick-Griffin-UCC-visit-%E2%80%98threat-to-safety%E2%80%99\n \nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/oct/17/nick-griffin-trinity-college-dublin\n \nhttp://www.leedsstudent.org/2012-10-26/ls1/leeds-student-speaks-to-nick-griffin-leader-of-the-bnp\n \nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/student-life/9881110/Marine-Le-Pen-sparks-Cambridge-protests.html\n \nhttps://twitter.com/culturisthub\n \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gooUZ2iD_Pw\n \nhttp://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/students-on-pimps-and-hoes-bar-crawl-800859\n \nSee 00:12:29 \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOJ8LT7DlfA\n, \n \nhttp://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=73549\n,\n \n \nhttp://thebeaveronline.co.uk/2010/12/07/abdel-bari-atwan-talk-sees-students-walk-out/\n \nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/feb/21/george-galloway-debate-israeli-oxford\n \nhttp://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/102638/israels-deputy-ambassador-forced-flee-essex-university-lecture\n \nhttp://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/88068/university-students-disrupt-israeli-ambassador-talk\n \nhttp://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/31165/israel-deputy-ambassador-shocked-manchester-attack\n \nhttp://www.thecst.org.uk/docs/Incidents%20Report%202012.pdf\n  (p.19)\nhttp://www.thecst.org.uk/docs/CST%20Incidents%20Report_Jan-June%202012.pdf\n, p.5.\n \nhttp://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/62277/nazi-students-hit-protester-lse-ski-trip\n \nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/alexander-meleagrouhitchens/the-future-of-campus-extr_b_1082401.html\n \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yKd8ZAymGU\n \nhttps://www.facebook.com/global.ideas.soc?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts\n \nhttps://www.facebook.com/#!/groups/143279022374652/\n \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUHFAXnVbWE\n \nhttps://www.facebook.com/#!/groups/QM.Ideological.Society/\n \nhttp://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/47884/students-elect-two-who-back-caliphate\n,\n \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxCNMRgqXNQ\n \nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2006/nov/19/secondworldwar.religion\n \n \nhttp://www.musu.mdx.ac.uk/uploads//No%20Platform%20Policy.pdf\n"
