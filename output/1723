defaultThe Society for Applied Microbiology
default (S
defaultf
defaultAM)
default is the oldest microbiology society in the UK. 
default&#xa0;
defaultS
defaultf
defaultAM 
defaultenvisages a future where applied microbiology research and development is strong in the UK and beyond, and the applications of microbiology contribute significantly to all global challenges facing humanity, including infectious diseases; the changing envir
defaultonment; sustainability of energy, food, water, and land resources; and economic growth.
default&#xa0;
defaultTo achieve this 
defaultvisi
defaulton, S
defaultf
defaultAM seeks to encourage equality and diversity in microbiology and related disciplines. This, with the express aim of 
defaultfully utilising
default the best talents in microbiolo
defaultgy and 
defaultensuring
default that the application
default of microbiology
default research
default serves the needs of all citizens.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis response is in addition to our endorse
defaultment of the Society of Biology submission
default to the same inquiry
default. 
defaultS
defaultf
defaultAM
default is a member organ
defaultisation of the Society of Biology.
default&#xa0;
defaultIntroduction
default&#xa0;
defaultWe find that equality and diversity issues in STEM are complex and that there is unlikely to be a single approach that 
defaultis effective to bring parity
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe also take the view that STEM careers provide a magnif
defaultying glass on inequality of opportunity in wider society. Academic careers are necessarily elitist because of the requirement for extensive post-16 education and specialist knowledge and skill. 
defaultAs a consequence of this, e
defaultvery inequality experienced by thos
defaulte from low socioeconomic status groups, girls and women, ethnic minorities, and people with disabilities, 
defaultis likely to take
default an individual a step further away from STEM as they go through life. Therefore, we believe that interventions that address inequalit
defaulty of opportunity from day one will be magnified in their effects in STEM.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhy do numbers of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder?
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWhilst the under representation of women in senior positions is perhaps less pronounced in microbiology, with several notable female professors among 
defaultS
defaultf
defaultAM
default’s membership
default and two of the past four Society presidents being female
default, there remains
default a lack of parity
default.
default&#xa0;defaultWorking environment
default,
default culture
default, and career progression
default&#xa0;
defaultFemale PhD
default graduates
default and postdocs tell us that they leave academia because they find the male-dominated environment oppressive 
defaultand unsupportive. They experience an environment that is inconsistent 
defaultwith their principles and values and they lack mentoring and guidance from senior colleagues.
default&#xa0;
defaultOne area of particular concern is the ability of senior scientists in managerial roles to nurture and develop women’s talents. 
defaultAs a direct result
default of conscious or unconscious bias, women scientists are often steered towards administrative and pastoral roles, which are relatively undervalued by academic employers. As a consequence
default,
default they do not 
defaultachieve
default career progression in line with male colleagues a
defaultnd so seek alternative careers where their talents and experience may be better appreciated.
default&#xa0;
defaultAnother factor in women STEM graduate 
defaultcareer 
defaultchoices is the culture of excessive working hours in academic research. Measurement of success is usually by output
default,
default 
defaultand what can be achieved in a normal working week is not seen as competitive for funding or career progression.
default Researchers are regularly working six or seven days a week and clocking up hours far in excess of 
defaultcontractual obligations
default.
default This particularly imp
defaultacts women early in their research careers when they may also be taking on additional responsibilities within the family context.
defaultThere is also a lack of transparency in recruitment and selection
default.
default 
defaultW
defaultith researchers often operating in niche areas with a lim
defaultited pool of recruitment panel members, it is the perception of our members that a degree of nepotism is at play and there is a sense of an ‘old boys network’.
default&#xa0;
defaultWork-life balance
default&#xa0;
defaultThere exists a s
defaultocial expectation that women take 
defaultprimary
default responsibility for
default child rearing
default. This actively excludes women from the practice of science, because of the culture of long working hours and presenteeism.
default&#xa0;
defaultOur members tell 
defaultus 
defaultthat they are aware of 
defaultindividuals with 
defaultnegative attitude towards maternity leave and
default their managers 
defaultare unaware of 
defaulteffective processes to manage parental leave to the benefit of the individual and the employer.
default Managers are also facing challenges in funding the cost of maternity leave from research grants.
default 
defaultAs a consequence, there is a per
defaultceived
default bias in recruiting, against women of child bearing age.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe path to a tenured position generally involves a number of short term, temporary, post-doctoral positions. It is also true that many scientists expect to be nationally or internationally mo
defaultbile during this phase of their career. 
defaultOur members tell us that this is discouraging for scientists who also wish to establish a stable home and family. Again, there is still a social expectation that a male partner is primary earner and his career will b
defaulte prioritised, particularly if it is ahead of an uncertain and risky career path of the female partner.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhen women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? What are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in dif
defaultferent employment sectors?
default&#xa0;
defaultWomen transition into a huge range of careers, however, the proportion of women who are not in STEM related jobs or not in employment at all is greater than the proportion of men.
default This is discussed with data in the Royal Society
default of Edinburgh’s April 2012 report, “Tapping all our talents”
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat should universities and the higher education sector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice?
default&#xa0;defaultAffordable, or free at the 
defaultpoint of service, childcare
default is the most commonly requested support. Indeed, 
defaultS
defaultf
defaultAM
default has recently implemented a facility to ‘top-up’ meeting attendance grants to cover childcare if it is necessary to enable a researcher to attend the meeting. Flexible working 
defaultand job sharing schemes are also valuable.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is a clear requirement for effective training in equality and diversity at all levels.
default It may also be useful to use tools to identify and address the impact of implicit social attitudes
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is also the ca
defaultse that many senior 
defaultprofessionals, including scientists, 
defaultlack the skills and training to be effective managers of people. This should be addressed as a matter of great urgency. In particular, training that encourages man
defaulta
defaultgers to value differences in style 
defaultand, indeed, make use of a diverse team in delivering organisational objectives.
default&#xa0;
defaultGreater openness and transparency in the recruitment and selection process is vital to address issues of nepotism and the ‘old boys network’. HR oversight and involvement in 
defaultall scientific appointments is absolutely necessary to ensure this.
defaultEvery organisation should have a robust personal and professional development review process to ensure matching of individual ambition with organisational obj
defaultectives and training 
defaultneeds. This should be intrinsic to an ongoing programme 
defaultaimed at realising
default the impact of research as opposed to short term fixes
default,
default often carried out
default in the run up to a REF exercise.
default&#xa0;
defaultInstitutions and the scientific community as a whole should institute c
defaultlear career paths that reward non-research contributions to academic life and consider output rates based on the time each person 
defaultreasonably chooses to commit
default beyond 
defaulttheir 
defaultcontracted working hours
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMentoring schemes
default are useful
default to support career planning 
defaultand also to discourage the ‘pulling up of ladders’ by senior women scientists. 
defaultAnd, in addition, c
defaultareer planning workshops that encourage the ‘Plan A’ 
defaultacademic 
defaultroute over
default various
default back-up plans
default (non-STEM careers, full time parenting, starting own business, 
defaultetc.)
default, which women are more likely to have in place
default or in mind
default than men.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat role should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers?
default&#xa0;
defaultFunding
default&#xa0;
defaultFollowing on from the chief medical officer’s statement that all NIHR 
defaultfunded departments should achieve Athena SWAN Silver within a reasonable time period, this should be extended to all research council funded departments.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere should be 
defaultfinancial 
defaultprovision in all publicly funded PhD and postdoc positions for the possibil
defaultity of maternity or paternity leave.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe
default assessment
default of research track-record by funding panels
default should
default take into account periods of part time
default working
default, career breaks, or parental leave.
default&#xa0;
defaultSupport and information for complainants and whistle blowers
default&#xa0;
defaultThe gov
defaulternment should provide support and information to employees for the pursuance of grievances or whistle blowing in organisations that are not operating 
defaultin line with existing equal
default opportunities policies and legislation.
default&#xa0;
defaultCommission social research
default&#xa0;
defaultThe gove
defaultrnment should commission research that measures the experience of women working in science and those who have left STEM careers
default,
default in order to establish qualitative base lines for future improvements in culture and work environment. Such research should be f
defaultree to question the rational orthodoxy and so present solutions outside of the established political and legal structures, which have so far failed to address the problem
default for more than 40 years
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultResearch should seek to re-
defaultimagine 
defaultthe problem of the under 
defaultrepresentation of women in 
defaultSTEM
