[normal]The Society for Applied Microbiology
[normal] (S
[normal]f
[normal]AM)
[normal] is the oldest microbiology society in the UK. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]S
[normal]f
[normal]AM 
[normal]envisages a future where applied microbiology research and development is strong in the UK and beyond, and the applications of microbiology contribute significantly to all global challenges facing humanity, including infectious diseases; the changing envir
[normal]onment; sustainability of energy, food, water, and land resources; and economic growth.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To achieve this 
[normal]visi
[normal]on, S
[normal]f
[normal]AM seeks to encourage equality and diversity in microbiology and related disciplines. This, with the express aim of 
[normal]fully utilising
[normal] the best talents in microbiolo
[normal]gy and 
[normal]ensuring
[normal] that the application
[normal] of microbiology
[normal] research
[normal] serves the needs of all citizens.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This response is in addition to our endorse
[normal]ment of the Society of Biology submission
[normal] to the same inquiry
[normal]. 
[normal]S
[normal]f
[normal]AM
[normal] is a member organ
[normal]isation of the Society of Biology.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Introduction
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We find that equality and diversity issues in STEM are complex and that there is unlikely to be a single approach that 
[normal]is effective to bring parity
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We also take the view that STEM careers provide a magnif
[normal]ying glass on inequality of opportunity in wider society. Academic careers are necessarily elitist because of the requirement for extensive post-16 education and specialist knowledge and skill. 
[normal]As a consequence of this, e
[normal]very inequality experienced by thos
[normal]e from low socioeconomic status groups, girls and women, ethnic minorities, and people with disabilities, 
[normal]is likely to take
[normal] an individual a step further away from STEM as they go through life. Therefore, we believe that interventions that address inequalit
[normal]y of opportunity from day one will be magnified in their effects in STEM.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Why do numbers of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Whilst the under representation of women in senior positions is perhaps less pronounced in microbiology, with several notable female professors among 
[normal]S
[normal]f
[normal]AM
[normal]’s membership
[normal] and two of the past four Society presidents being female
[normal], there remains
[normal] a lack of parity
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Working environment
[normal],
[normal] culture
[normal], and career progression
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Female PhD
[normal] graduates
[normal] and postdocs tell us that they leave academia because they find the male-dominated environment oppressive 
[normal]and unsupportive. They experience an environment that is inconsistent 
[normal]with their principles and values and they lack mentoring and guidance from senior colleagues.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]One area of particular concern is the ability of senior scientists in managerial roles to nurture and develop women’s talents. 
[normal]As a direct result
[normal] of conscious or unconscious bias, women scientists are often steered towards administrative and pastoral roles, which are relatively undervalued by academic employers. As a consequence
[normal],
[normal] they do not 
[normal]achieve
[normal] career progression in line with male colleagues a
[normal]nd so seek alternative careers where their talents and experience may be better appreciated.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Another factor in women STEM graduate 
[normal]career 
[normal]choices is the culture of excessive working hours in academic research. Measurement of success is usually by output
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]and what can be achieved in a normal working week is not seen as competitive for funding or career progression.
[normal] Researchers are regularly working six or seven days a week and clocking up hours far in excess of 
[normal]contractual obligations
[normal].
[normal] This particularly imp
[normal]acts women early in their research careers when they may also be taking on additional responsibilities within the family context.
[normal]There is also a lack of transparency in recruitment and selection
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]ith researchers often operating in niche areas with a lim
[normal]ited pool of recruitment panel members, it is the perception of our members that a degree of nepotism is at play and there is a sense of an ‘old boys network’.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Work-life balance
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There exists a s
[normal]ocial expectation that women take 
[normal]primary
[normal] responsibility for
[normal] child rearing
[normal]. This actively excludes women from the practice of science, because of the culture of long working hours and presenteeism.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our members tell 
[normal]us 
[normal]that they are aware of 
[normal]individuals with 
[normal]negative attitude towards maternity leave and
[normal] their managers 
[normal]are unaware of 
[normal]effective processes to manage parental leave to the benefit of the individual and the employer.
[normal] Managers are also facing challenges in funding the cost of maternity leave from research grants.
[normal] 
[normal]As a consequence, there is a per
[normal]ceived
[normal] bias in recruiting, against women of child bearing age.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The path to a tenured position generally involves a number of short term, temporary, post-doctoral positions. It is also true that many scientists expect to be nationally or internationally mo
[normal]bile during this phase of their career. 
[normal]Our members tell us that this is discouraging for scientists who also wish to establish a stable home and family. Again, there is still a social expectation that a male partner is primary earner and his career will b
[normal]e prioritised, particularly if it is ahead of an uncertain and risky career path of the female partner.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]When women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? What are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in dif
[normal]ferent employment sectors?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Women transition into a huge range of careers, however, the proportion of women who are not in STEM related jobs or not in employment at all is greater than the proportion of men.
[normal] This is discussed with data in the Royal Society
[normal] of Edinburgh’s April 2012 report, “Tapping all our talents”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What should universities and the higher education sector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice?
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Affordable, or free at the 
[normal]point of service, childcare
[normal] is the most commonly requested support. Indeed, 
[normal]S
[normal]f
[normal]AM
[normal] has recently implemented a facility to ‘top-up’ meeting attendance grants to cover childcare if it is necessary to enable a researcher to attend the meeting. Flexible working 
[normal]and job sharing schemes are also valuable.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is a clear requirement for effective training in equality and diversity at all levels.
[normal] It may also be useful to use tools to identify and address the impact of implicit social attitudes
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is also the ca
[normal]se that many senior 
[normal]professionals, including scientists, 
[normal]lack the skills and training to be effective managers of people. This should be addressed as a matter of great urgency. In particular, training that encourages man
[normal]a
[normal]gers to value differences in style 
[normal]and, indeed, make use of a diverse team in delivering organisational objectives.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Greater openness and transparency in the recruitment and selection process is vital to address issues of nepotism and the ‘old boys network’. HR oversight and involvement in 
[normal]all scientific appointments is absolutely necessary to ensure this.
[normal]Every organisation should have a robust personal and professional development review process to ensure matching of individual ambition with organisational obj
[normal]ectives and training 
[normal]needs. This should be intrinsic to an ongoing programme 
[normal]aimed at realising
[normal] the impact of research as opposed to short term fixes
[normal],
[normal] often carried out
[normal] in the run up to a REF exercise.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Institutions and the scientific community as a whole should institute c
[normal]lear career paths that reward non-research contributions to academic life and consider output rates based on the time each person 
[normal]reasonably chooses to commit
[normal] beyond 
[normal]their 
[normal]contracted working hours
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Mentoring schemes
[normal] are useful
[normal] to support career planning 
[normal]and also to discourage the ‘pulling up of ladders’ by senior women scientists. 
[normal]And, in addition, c
[normal]areer planning workshops that encourage the ‘Plan A’ 
[normal]academic 
[normal]route over
[normal] various
[normal] back-up plans
[normal] (non-STEM careers, full time parenting, starting own business, 
[normal]etc.)
[normal], which women are more likely to have in place
[normal] or in mind
[normal] than men.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What role should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Funding
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Following on from the chief medical officer’s statement that all NIHR 
[normal]funded departments should achieve Athena SWAN Silver within a reasonable time period, this should be extended to all research council funded departments.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There should be 
[normal]financial 
[normal]provision in all publicly funded PhD and postdoc positions for the possibil
[normal]ity of maternity or paternity leave.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The
[normal] assessment
[normal] of research track-record by funding panels
[normal] should
[normal] take into account periods of part time
[normal] working
[normal], career breaks, or parental leave.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Support and information for complainants and whistle blowers
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The gov
[normal]ernment should provide support and information to employees for the pursuance of grievances or whistle blowing in organisations that are not operating 
[normal]in line with existing equal
[normal] opportunities policies and legislation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Commission social research
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The gove
[normal]rnment should commission research that measures the experience of women working in science and those who have left STEM careers
[normal],
[normal] in order to establish qualitative base lines for future improvements in culture and work environment. Such research should be f
[normal]ree to question the rational orthodoxy and so present solutions outside of the established political and legal structures, which have so far failed to address the problem
[normal] for more than 40 years
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Research should seek to re-
[normal]imagine 
[normal]the problem of the under 
[normal]representation of women in 
[normal]STEM
