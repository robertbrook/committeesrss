[[[About the Road Safety Markings Association (RSMA)]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[8.1]]]              RSMA is the largest specialist trade association in the highways sector, representing more than 90 per cent of the sector by volume it has a total of 95 member companies all of which carry relevant quality assurance as a requirement of membership.&#xa0;

[[[8.2]]]              The RSMA’s activities emphasise quality, health &amp; safety and training and it has invested substantially in these areas over the past decade, in order to help highways companies and organisations to drive up sector standards and deliver higher quality in a safer manner.&#xa0; It has a clear focus on setting standards for its members.&#xa0;

[[[8.3]]]              The association has developed a large NVQ Assessment Centre, qualifying in excess of 800 road marking operatives and has been the first organisation to introduce specialist apprenticeships in the highways sector.&#xa0; The centre delivers or facilitates delivery of a wide range of NVQ and training solutions for roadmarking companies.&#xa0; As a result, 90 per cent of the operative workforce is qualified, and there is a clear career structure now in place for the industry for both management and operatives.&#xa0;
