Written evidence submitted bydefault defaultScottish Environment LINKdefault&#xa0;defaultLand, sea and airdefaultLand, sea and air are the spaces where life exists on our planet. They are the fundamental spheres of our environment and together constitute the biosphere.  As a species, we share these spaces with the other species and the natural, physical universe. In 
defaultthis shared space, whether urban, rural or wild, we depend upon the other species, as they depend upon us. The principles we offer for the land in this submission (and the suggestions as to how they might be applied) underlie our approach to the land, but 
defaultto the seas and the air also.

defaultLINK welcomes the opportunity to contribute to 
defaultthe House of Commons’ 
defaultSco
defaultttish Affairs Committee
default consultation on comprehensive land reform in Scotland
default.
default We have only a limited mandate to offer comments on the economic and social aspects of land reform
default,
default but 
defaultwe 
defaulthope that we might offer a significant perspective with regard to 
defaultmany
default of these concerns and, in particular, to 
defaultenvironmental concerns.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn this sub
defaultmission we seek to 
defaultoutline our broad views on
default:
default&#xa0;
defaultWe then
default 
defaultsummarise our aspirations for public policy governing the relationship between the
default land and the people of Scotland.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat constitutes Land Reform?defaultMuch of the debate on land reform has been about land ownership, almost always acknowledging that ownership affects land use,
default but paying 
defaultso
default little attention to 
defaultthe way we use land as to 
defaultamount to ignoring the issue. 
defaultIt is land use
default 
defaultwhich most concerns LINK and its members. We are aware that a new type of owner 
defaultmightdefault change the use they make of 
defaulta piece of
default land, but we are also aware that the new owner might stick, to all intents and purpose
defaults
default, to exactly the same usage.
default From an ecological perspective it is NOT the ownership of the land that is important, but the way the land is used.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn LINK we start from the position that much of the way we use the land of Scotland currently is not sustaina
defaultble. Huge economic, social and environmental benefits could be obtained from improving the levels of sustainability in the way we use the land – but if land reform does not lead to a major change in 
defaultattitudes to 
defaultland use it might be a missed opportunity, a
defaultnd, at worst 
defaultpositively harmful to our environment
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultW
defaulthile as LINK we are 
defaultprimarily 
defaultinterested in the use of the land rather than necessarily who owns it (since you can have good and bad examples of all kinds of ownership), we 
defaultreadily
default acknowledge that the way
default most of
default the land is currently used is being driven by the 
defaulthistoric patterns of usage and by 
defaultsubsidy
default 
defaultsystems.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultThe
defaultse
default historically established patterns of 
defaultownership 
defaultand our 
defaultpublic institutions
default and policies
default 
defaulthave led to 
defaultmost
default of the problems 
defaultand 
defaultprompting the 
defaultsolutions 
defaultwe have identified in the 
defaultsection on 
default‘
defaultour aspirations
default’
default at the end of this submission. We call for much needed 
defaultlegal protections for the ecosystems, public accountability of landowners, equitable taxation and bal
defaultan
defaultced subsidy regimes, because so much current ownership is for single or limited land uses, with little or no reference to
default the public interest
default and the principles of sustainability. 
defaultIt is time for the defaultlanddefault debate to defaultgive defaultequal spacedefault to land defaultownership and defaultto defaultland defaultuse.default&#xa0;defaultDefining CommunitiesdefaultLINK believes that t
defaulthe health of our democracy relies on recognition of the existence of communities of both place, and interest, and the representative function of people who have the assent of both types of community.
default We hope that the concept of “community ownership” is 
defaultinterpreted
default by the 
defaultCommittee 
defaultto the ownership of land by communities in both senses. We ask 
defaultthat it be
default note
defaultd
default that some LINK members own significant areas of land in Scotland and that we consider this to
default be land held in trust for the communities of citizens who are our members – and for the community that is the nation. A fuller explanation of our views on the definition of community can be found in our MSP and Councillors briefing:

defaultOwnership defaultYou can’t “own” a cloud, or 
defaultthe rain
default, or a river. Nobody “owns” a 
defaultwild animal
default under Scots law
default. 
defaultFor these reasons
default, you
default can't 
default“
defaultown
default”
default the land, the sea or the air
default in the 
defaultsame way you can exclusively own a piece of moveable property
default.
default 
defaultNor can you own land intimately (albeit for a limited period of time) 
defaultas you can intellectual
default property
default. When land, sea and air
default are “owned”, it is conditional on the understanding that
default they are already, in fact rather than 
defaulta 
defaultlegal 
defaultconstruct
default, 
defaultshared
default 
defaultjointly
default by all 
defaultmembers of all species who use that
default 
defaultspace. This
default 
defaultjoint 
defaultspace is the ecosystem, and for 
defaultboth legal and scientific purposes, we all live in one space. We all live in an ecosystem
default – the biosphere -
default and 
defaulta small part of 
defaultthis 
defaultecosystem can 
defaultbe "owned"
default purely
default 
defaultwith
defaultin the legal 
defaultlimitations
default,
default and
default 
defaultwith 
defaultthe very
default real inclusion of all others. Legal o
defaultwnersh
defaultip of land is conditional, therefore, 
defaulton the understanding that such "ownership" is subsidiary to land bei
defaultng a part of the common wealth
default of all people and all species
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultSeveral members of LINK “own” land
default (
defaultas do many other non-Governmental organisations rep
defaultresenting communities of place and interest
default in urban and rural settings
default)
default. Such ownership is an important means to achieving environmental and cultural 
defaultconservation objectives. T
defaulthe legal rights from such ownership are important 
defaultin this respect
default,
default and should be protected
default. The land concerned is 
defaultmanaged in full recognition of the limitations and duties of such “ownership”
default,
default including the responsibilities to other people and other species.
default&#xa0;
defaultSome of the LINK members with Scottish land holdings have unde
defaultrtaken a joint study of their ownership of land and the results of this project are available at:

default&#xa0;
defaultStewardship and SustainabilitydefaultMany environmentalists and conservationists do not readily accept the notion of human dominion over the biosphere held by some relig
defaultious or humanist groups, but we all recognise the simple fact of human history and presence. People have an enormous impact on the biosphere and a duty to manage our activities responsibly, particularly where our use of space threatens the very existence o
defaultf other species. We believe that our history 
defaultdemonstrates the need for an acceptance of the idea that our species has a duty of “stewardship” of the environment, however that might be defined. Since the last ice age human society has used and changed the v
defaultast bulk of Scottish land directly – through agriculture, deforestation, reforestation, urbanisation, mineral extraction and other uses. Indirectly, all of the land of Scotland is farther affected by human activity through global processes such as climate 
defaultchange or damage to the ozone layer.  
default&#xa0;
defaultLINK has no preference between the many types of limited legal ownership or dominion of land by people. All such forms can provide either benign or malign stewardship within the principles of sustainability we believ
defaulte in. 
defaultWe 
defaulthave, however, set out our wish 
defaultto see 
default“
defaultrea
defaultl subsidiarity, where decisions 
defaultare taken at the ne
defaultarest appropriate and practical 
defaultlevel, and
default where communities of place and 
defaultinterest can
default assess the long-term economic, 
defaultsocial and envir
defaultonmental consequenc
defaultes for their 
defaultlives and the liv
defaultes of future generations before 
defaultdecisions are made.

defaultEnvironmentalists and conservationists do not seek, generally or widely, to “re-establish wilderness” or “reclaim all land from human use”, as has been sometimes claimed - but we do s
defaulteek to ensure that human land use respects the ecosystem and biodiversity, together with our landscape, cultural and historic legacy, and that the land is sustained for future generations. This aim includes our mainly limited, or sometimes zero, interventi
defaulton in areas of land we “own” as a community of interest. Scotland has obligations in international law to achieve sustainability – and in this we believe Scotland must follow the precepts and definitions laid out in the 1987 report of the Brundtland Commis
defaultsion, ‘Our Common Future’.

default We believe that this area of public policy is in need of reform urgently if we are to achieve truly sustainable development.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe want a Scotland where……default&#xa0;
default…..default all land owners and managers understand and observe defined environmental rights and responsibilidefaultties.default We recognise and understand that the Scottish community has the right and shall decide upon the system for the economic and social division of the land between people. This division, however constituted, must be balanced by a full understanding of th
defaulte shared aspects of our dominion over land - the ecosystem cycles and services and the biodiversity that are an inseparable 
defaultfunction of the space. L
defaultegal protections must be put in place to ensure the integrity of these cycles, services and biodiversity.
default&#xa0;
default…..default the ownership or dominion over land is open and transparent.default We need public registers of land that allow us to know exactly who bears the legal duties and responsibilities for ecosystem cycles and services within any de
defaultfined space – in order that these
default duties and responsibilities
default can be enforced
default and the ecosystem services protected
default. This transparency must cover all land
default,
default and ownership 
defaultand management 
defaultby communities, ind
defaultividuals and corporate entities. It should 
defaultallow for the identification of ‘absentee’ 
defaultowners who do not live on the land owned.
default&#xa0;
default…..default all public policy for land is set out in a democratically established Land Use Strategy.default The strategy should be developed from that established in the Climate Change (Scotland) Act (2009) and should continue to be based upon the principles of environmental, social and economic sustainability. It should ensure that both communities and the eco
defaultsystem are sustained for future 
defaultgenerations. 
defaultIt should include 
defaultefficient processes to ensure the accountability of land 
defaultmanag
defaulters for their performance in delivering the strategy 
defaultand refer to
default effective regulatory system
defaults
default.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultWe
default set out our view of these princ
defaultiples in the paper ‘Li
defaultving with the Land’ which can be found at:
default 
defaulthttp://www.scotlink.org/files/publication/LINKReports/LINKReportLivingwithLand.pdf
default&#xa0;
default…..default the defaultplanning and regulatory systems for land use take account of global, national and local defaultterrestrial, freshwater and marine defaultecosystem impacts.default We need protections for ecosystem cycles, services and biodiversity which are based on the best available science 
default- including the clear designation of spaces and appropriate management responsibilities where threatened species are located, in order that biodiversity is maintained.
default&#xa0;
default……default any land taxation is designed to be economically, socially and environmentally sustadefaultinable.default It should be equitable, and underpinned by an awareness of the effect of the fiscal regime on the ecosystem and biodiversity. Alongside the promotion of economic and social development, one of the core purposes of any land taxation should be the pr
defaultotection of the ecosystem and biodiversity.
default&#xa0;
default……default any public policy subsidy for land use fully balancesdefault economic, social and defaultenvironmental concerns.default Public policy should recognise that unbalanced subsidy regimes can cause severely dangerous impacts to commun
defaultities, the ecosystem and biodiversity.
default Such public policy should also be consistent and coherent in all its many strands.
default&#xa0;
default…..default defaultopenness and public participation are central features of our governance for land use.default 
defaultWe want the methods and processes of government at 
defaultlocal and national 
defaultlevels

default&#xa0;
default….. defaulttdefaulthere is defaultrecognitiondefault thatdefault the term ‘community’ applies to both communities of place and communities of interest.default We want to see a balance
default 
defaultbetween the views of local communities and communities that seek to apply principles relating to national and global is
defaultsues of concern such as the fight against climate change or the protection of ecosystems and biodiversity.
default We believe that the community interest is best represented when communities of place and interest co-operate.
default&#xa0;
default…default.. the traditional right to roam of Sdefaultcots defaultis maintained.default The Land Reform (Scotland) Act (2003) set out in legislation for the first time the right of public access to land in Scotland
default, with the attendant responsibilities of the public and land managers
default. We want to see this right jealously gua

default recognition of the underlying principle that land ‘ownership’ is conditional and limited in Scotland – and subject to public rights and interest.
