"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the \nNational Federation of Retail Newsagents \n[PCC Progress 11]\n&#xa0;Introduction&#xa0;1. The National Federation of Retail Newsagents (NFRN) would like to thank the\n Home Affairs\n Committee for the invitation to make a written submission on the\n performance \nof \nPolice and Crime C\nommissioners\n (PCC\ns\n)\n.\n&#xa0;2. The NFRN is one of Europe’s largest trade associations, representing over 16,000 fee paying members from approximately 18,000 independent newsagents and convenience stores across the UK, Channel Islands and the Republic of Ireland. We are a membership led organisation that is democratically structured; policy is made by annual conference and its implementation is overseen by National Council.\n&#xa0;\n3. The NFRN assis\nts the independent retailer to \ncompete more effectively in today’s highly competitive market through the provision of practical help and assistance, commercial support, deals and buying opportunities, training, expert\nise and services. I\nt also represents its members’\n interests at governmental and p\narliamentary level, as well as within the news and magazine industry. \n&#xa0;\nGeneral Remarks&#xa0;4.\n The NFRN understands the importance of the\n role of\n \nPCC\n \nto both the police and local communities. \n&#xa0;\n5. With this in mind, the NFRN is working towards its aim of meeting all \nPCCs\n over the course of the coming year.\n&#xa0;\n6. NFRN engage\nment with PC\nCs has already started. We recently wrote a letter to all PCCs regar\nding our concerns about shoplifting and the impact it ha\ns on our members\n’ businesses\n. Going forward\ns\n, we\n will continue to engage with\n P\nC\nCs\n through regular contact and our newsletter, to keep\n \nthem\n informed\n about the key crime issues facing the independent retail sector\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n7. However it is important to note that one year is not long enough to be able to fully judge the performance of PCCs.\n&#xa0;\n8\n. In our submission to the committee’s inquiry, \nthe NFRN will focus on the two following areas\n, from the Federation’s perspective of their handling of the issue of shoplifting\n and anti-social behaviour\n:\n&#xa0;\n- The \neffectiveness of commissioners in reducing crime and delivering an effective police service within their police force area\n&#xa0;\n- \nThe effectiveness of commissioners in promoting local policing priorities\n&#xa0;\nDeclaration of Interests&#xa0;9. \nWhilst we \nwork\n to engage with PCCs on beh\nalf of our members, we have no further\n relationship with them.\n&#xa0;The effectiveness of commissioners in reducing crime and delivering an effective police service within their police force area&#xa0;10. \nIn the \nperiod\n since c\nommissioners were elected, \nthere have been a number of notable achievements delivered by various PCCs. \n&#xa0;\n11. \nW\ne welcomed news that the PCC for West Yorkshire Mark Burns-Williamson had launched a petition with the intention of persuading the government to ensure that the funds generated from seized criminal assets are spent on community and anti-crime initiatives in the same areas where the crimes were committed\n. \n&#xa0;\n12. \nIn addition\n, a number of PC\nCs have launched community crime funds in their areas to help \ntackle\n problems. PCC for Avon and Somerset \nSue Mountstevens\n \nhas allocated £2.4m to various organisations in the area to help reduce crime and disorder. The fund will also provide support for victims of crime\n, a move supported by the NFRN\n. \n \n&#xa0;13. \nHowever, there is still room for improvement \nin terms of the effectiveness with which commissioners are reducing crime and delivering an effective police service within thei\nr areas.\n \nFor example, the way in which\n business crime, specifically shoplifting\n, is dealt with is of concern to the Federation\n’s members\n.\n&#xa0;\n14. \nDiscussions with our members and recent media reports have\n raised concerns amongst the NFRN that \nshoplifting is not being \ndealt with\n seriously enough by police and police and crime commissioners.\n&#xa0;\n15. \nAn investigation by the Birmingham Mail for example, discovered that police had failed to investigate or record more than 60% of shoplifting incidents that had taken place in Birmingham’s city centre\n. \n&#xa0;\n16. \nFurthermore, it was reported in August 2013 that \nHammersmith and Fulham police\n had dropped a proposal to \nnot arrest\n those who\n shoplift goods under £50\n. \nWhilst it is fortunate the proposal was not adopted, \nthe NFRN considers that \nit should not have been considered in the first place as it would have undermined the businesses of our members.\n&#xa0;\n17. \nT\nhe NFRN appreciate\ns\n that PCCs are not in operational control of the \npolice; however\n they do set their priorities. \nTherefore we feel that more work needs to be done to ensure that this important issue is not \nallowed to slip down the policing agenda in terms of performance.  \n&#xa0;\n18. \nAnother issue where improvements could be made is anti-social behaviour against retail workers more generally.\n&#xa0;\n19. \nUnfortunately, newsagents and convenience stores are easy targets for such behaviour\n in light of their late opening hours and the\n relatively\n few members of staff on duty in comparison to the large supermarkets\n. \n&#xa0;\n20. \nIn a survey we conducted recently of our membership, \n35.7% of respondents had been a victim of crime or anti-social behaviour \nin\n the last 12 months\n.\n&#xa0;\n21. \nFurthermore, research published recently by the Union \nof Shop Distributive and Allied Workers\n (Usdaw)\n revealed that of their shop worker respondents, \n1 in 5 report verbal\n \nabuse on a daily or weekly basis\n, almost 1 in 10 report a threat of violence at least once a month.\n \n&#xa0;\n22. A survey carried out for Independent Retail News also showed that the number of independent retailers who had been a victim of violent crime had increased from 8%in 2010 to 15% in 2011.\n&#xa0;\n23\n. \nAnti\n-social behaviour, violence \nand threatening behaviour \nare\n problem\ns\n that \nare\n c\nontinuing to blight our members’ livelihoods.\n&#xa0;\n24\n. \nWe are appreciative of work already done on this issue by PCC’s. For example, in October 2013 the NFRN was pleased to learn that Commissioners had joined Chief Constables to support a campaign week seeking to tackle the problem\n.\n&#xa0;\n25\n. \nHowever in light of this continuing problem, we feel that more attention needs to be placed on the issue\n to help protect retailers and their staff from this behaviour\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe effectiveness of commissioners in promoting local policing priorities&#xa0;26\n. \nThe NFRN will focus its response\n to this question on its knowledge of the priority PCCs place on the issue of shoplifting.\n&#xa0;\n27\n. \nAs noted previously in this submission, the Federation wrote to all PCCs asking them to clarify their approach to this form of crime. \n&#xa0;\n28\n. \nT\nhe responses we have received from\n Police and Crime Commissioners regarding shoplifting, have all sought to reassure the NFRN that the issue of shoplifting remains high in the list of policing priorities.\n&#xa0;\n29\n. \nIn practice, PCCs have gone to varying lengths in their promotion of policing priorities. Whilst some have simply provided assurance that they understand the importance of the issue, others have taken steps to demonstrate that this is \ntruly \nthe case.\n&#xa0;\n30\n. \nClive Grunshaw, PCC for Lancashire advised us that a business crime lead for the \nConstabulary\n had been appointed and that he personally holds the Chief Constable to account for performance in this area.\n&#xa0;\n31\n. \nFurthermore, Bill Longmore the PCC for West Mercia revealed that he was in the process of developing a Business Crime strategy for both West Mercia and Warwickshire police and Essex PCC Nick Alston \nheld a business crime forum to discuss the issue.\n&#xa0;\n32\n. \nHowever, the issue is not being as demonstrably prioritised in other areas of the country. Mark Burns-Williamson OBE, PCC for West Yorkshire recognised the importance of the issue but admitted it was “not specifically a priority within the Police and Crime Plan”. \n&#xa0;\n33\n. \nIt is evident that the effectiveness of PCCs in promoting this issue varies considerably in different areas.\n&#xa0;\n34\n. \nThe NFRN appreciates the hard work many PCCs have put into dealing with this matter but would encourage all commissioners to do the same, in order for this type of behaviour to be tackled effectively. \n&#xa0;35\n. \nWe would welcome the issues\n of shoplifting and anti-social behaviour becoming priorities in all Police and Crime Plans\n and the NFRN will seek to engage with PCCs as they develop these plans\n.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/04/police-crime-commissioners-five-best-worst-ideas\n \n \nhttp://www.avonandsomerset-pcc.gov.uk/News-and-Events/News-Archive/2013/May/PCCs-24m-fund-to-tackle-crime-and-disorder.aspx\n \n \nhttp://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/police-fail-follow-up-nearly-two-thirds-4282770\n \n \nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2396258/Police-forced-scrap-barmy-plan-arrest-shoplifters-goods-50-business-owners-branded-looters-charter.html\n \n \nhttp://www.usdaw.org.uk/FFFSurveyResults\n \n \nhttp://www.apccs.police.uk/press-releases/press-release-281013\n \n"
