"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Professor Steve Jones (CLC0067)In\n evidence given to your Committee’s inquiry on climate science, the BBC Head of Editorial Standard’s\n,\n David Jordan\n said\n that \nthe BBC “…had decided not to follow Jones' key recommendations on climate change: ‘[Jones] made one recommendation that we did \nnot take on board. He said we should regard climate science as settled … we should not hear from dissenting voices on the science.’\"\nWhile writing my Report to the BBC Trust on science coverage I was in general impressed by the breadth, depth and balance o\nf the Corporation’s treatment of the subject, and have been equally so by its rapid and effective responses to many of the suggestions I made (that of the dangers of “false balance” included). \nM\ny report\n was\n, though,\n greeted with \nsome\n \ndisagreement\n by respec\nted commentators\n:\nDaily Mail (Melanie Phillips):\n “… wickedly cynical propaganda to promote a false belief”.\nSunday Times (Nigel Lawson):\n … characterised chiefly by ignorance and intolerance”.\nDaily Express (David Rose)\n … seems to want BBC coverage to be su\nbject to quasi-Stalinistic thought policing”.\nDaily Telegraph (Christopher Booker)\n \n“\n… the astonishing claim that the only problem with the coverage of climate change was not that it was too biased, but that it was not biased enough”.\nDaily Telegraph (James\n Delingpole)\n “… a sustained and brilliant rebuttal to the threadbare notion that our state broadcaster is in any way capable of being fair and balanced”.\nA similar but less immoderate statement was made \nmore \nrecently in \nThe Guardian \nby Peter Preston:\n \n“\n2,00\n0 climatologists signing pieces of paper don't automatically convert a doubting public. … I'm an urgent believer in doing something about global warming. But I also live in a democracy. And nothing is QED”.\nIn spite of such claims\n, I emphatically did not s\nay that “we should regard climate science as settled … we should not hear from dissenting voices on the science”. \nWhat I did in fact say in the BBC Trust report was: \n“\nFor science … there is a wide acceptance of a body of scrutinised fact, interrupted by r\nare moments when ideas change. Constantly to call in external voices unwilling to accept that principle is not to engage in debate but in meaningless polemic.\n … \nAttempts to give a place to anyone, however unqualified, who claims interest can make for false\n balance: to free publicity for marginal opinions and not to impartiality, but its opposite.\n … \nThere should be no attempt to give equal weight to opinion and to evidence.\n”\nThe\n producers of the\n recent \nToday Programme \npiece on the new IPCC report tried, we a\nre told, more than a dozen \nqualified climate \nscientists willing to give an opposing view but could not find\n a single\n one (a hint, perhaps, that there is indeed a scientific consensus on global warming). Instead, they \ngave equal time \nto a\n well-known expert \nand to\n Australian \nretired geologist with no background in the field: in my view a classic of “false balance”.\nHaving said that, I reiterate that in my view BBC science coverage is good and getting better, that the Corporation responded quick\nly and effectiv\nely to most of my\n recommendations and that the balance \nproblem is\n now\n less severe than it was. Indeed, it now seems to be more or less confined to news reporting abou\nt climate change. Why the BBC remains\n so obsessed with contrarian views \non this subject I \ndo not know.\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
