default&#xa0;
defaultThe issues with gram-negative bacteria include both the transfer of resistance, by loops of DNA called plasmids, among bacteria, and the spread of successful resistant bacterial strains among patients.  What is more, resistant 
defaultEnterobacteriaceae
default (E. coli and related species) can be carried in the healthy human gut for months or years, facilitating spread e.g. in care homes.

defaultWhat are the gaps in our knowledge about antimicrobial resistance?
default&#xa0;
defaultDespite the agreed need for good ‘antibiotic stewardship’ there is a lack of clarity about what good stewardship looks like, beyond a general agreement on the obvious point that profligate use drives further resistance for little gain.
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is a simplistic tendency in the UK to equate stewardship with minimising use of 
defaultcephalosporins
default and 
defaultfluoroquinolones
default, which were blamed for the 
defaultClostridium 
defaultdifficile
default 
defaultproblem of the last decade. Consequently there are major balancing increases in the use of a very narrow range of alternative antibiotics, especially 
defaultpiperacillin-tazobactam
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default There are reasonable grounds to fear that this will end badly, insofar as it concentrates selection pressure on these few heavily used agents, and can be characterised as 'squeezing the balloon'. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSuch concentrated usage led to repeated sequential destruction of antibiotics against 
defaultNeisseria
default 
defaultgonorrhoeae
default (first sulphonamides, then low dose penicillin, then high dose penicillin, then ciprofloxacin, latterly 
defaultcefixime
default….)
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultIt might be better stewardship to seek to minimise total usage but to seek heterogeneity of antimicrobial prescribing within this limited total. default&#xa0;
default3.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default Is there sufficient research and investment into new antibiotics or other treatments and methods to ensure continued protection against infection? If not, how could this be rectified?
default&#xa0;
defaultNo: there is not sufficient.
default&#xa0;
default Private investment should be made more attractive, given that govt spending already greatly exceeds revenues, limiting the scope for public funding.
default&#xa0;
default The GAIN Act in the US is a useful model, effectively extending patent life and is already stimulating considerable interest.
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultMore generally I would favour Pull rather than Push incentives, as being more likely to encourage diversity of development rather than bureaucratic attempts to ‘pick winners’.  
default&#xa0;
defaultBarriers to entry should be reduced.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultPharma
default repeatedly tells me that a typical Phase III trial enrolling 1000 patients (300 per arm plus 'wastage') costs $50-100m, or $50000-100000 per patient --- usually far more than the patient's total treatment costs .
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default This means that only a few large companies can run such trials and creates a bottleneck, even when small 
defaultpharma
default has promising drug candidates.
default&#xa0;
default We should identify why costs are so high (demands of regulators or demands of the physicians/hospitals who recruit and supply the patients entered) and seek to reduce them.

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default What measures (including behavioural change) have been most effective in controlling the spread of resistant pathogens, and could such measures be used to control other pathogens? 
default&#xa0;defaultInfection control is effective when the issue is 
defaultclonal
default spread of bacterial strains among patients by cross-infection, as with MRSA. It is, however, less clear that infection control works when the issue is dispersion of resistance plasmids coding resistance among different 
defaultEnterobacteriaceae
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultFines to hospitals for MRSA 
defaultbacteraemias
default and 
defaultC. diff
default have worked (case numbers are reduced) but are now distorting activity.   Hospitals now worry more about the one MRSA bacteraemia than about 30 
defaultE. coli
default 
defaultbacteraemias
default, yet 
defaultE. coli
default 
defaultbacteraemias
default, many of them caused my resistant strains, are increasing whilst MRSA declines…
default&#xa0;
defaultFear that 
defaultcephalosporins
default select for 
defaultC. diff
default has led to extreme aversion to using these agents even when they are appropriate therapy and the patient is at low risk for C.

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default What global coordination and action is required to fight antimicrobial resistance and is the UK contributing enough towards cross-border initiatives?
default&#xa0;
defaultWe should seek to collaborate internationally on surveillance of resistance --- this is good across EU with EARS-net, but weaker with Commonwealth countries with which we have major population flows 
defaultesp
default the Indian sub-continent, where resistance is extremely prevalent.
default&#xa0;
default We need to support constructive initiatives, e.g. Chennai Declaration, in India.
default&#xa0;
default Note, more generally, that resistance is most prevalent in newly prosperous developing countries.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe need to recognise that growing chaos in the Middle East &amp; N Africa will spread resistance--- UK brought 50 casualties from Libyan conflict to UK for treatment &amp; dispersed across hospitals---- at least 12 of these patients had multi-resistant bacteria sent to AMRHAI, 6 of them K.

default&#xa0;
defaultWe should co-operate within the EU e.g. on improving licensing regulation (which is handled via EMA) and on legislation akin to the GAIN act, creating 'Pull' incentives.

default What are the strengths and weaknesses of the Government’s 2013-2018 strategy for tackling antimicrobial resistance? What changes might be made to further strengthen the Government’s action plan?
