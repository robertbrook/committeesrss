defaultAn obsession with outdated financial mechanisms 
defaultmeans that 
defaultBritaindefault more consistently defaultfavourdefaultsdefault the past rather than the future, the unsustainable rather than the sustainable and the anti-competitive rather than the competitive.default&#xa0;

defaultIt is unclear whether parliament has been consistently lied to (in respect
default of
default 
defaultthe range of
default financial support mechanisms it is legally entitled to use in promoting 
defaultany
default transformation to a 'Green' economy) but, at the very least, 
defaultBritain has developed a propensity to self-deceive in order to under-achievedefault.

defaultA stronger government lead, simpler accessdefault to finance, defaultand more ambitious targeting could still transform the UK energy landscape.default&#xa0;
default1.1 
defaultIn this submission to the Committee' Inquiry, I want to focus on specific points that have come out of several visits I have arranged, for politicians and others, looking at the different approach to Green Finance in Germany. There are other examples of more innovative approaches in North America, but I will focus on what other EU Member States are already doing within the single European market.

default2. Feed in Tariffs (FITs)default&#xa0;
default2.1 
defaultUKdefault defaultconstraintsdefault defaulton the financing of FITs aredefault defaultdeeplydefault defaultregressivedefault.default In 2010, the Treasury 'rescued' the FITs 
defaultprogramme
default in the same way that South Africa 'rescued' Nelson Mandela to 
defaultRobben
default Island. It was turned from a self-financing scheme within the energy sector accounts into a fixed-budget 
defaultprogramme
default that had to be counted against public expenditure limits. Since then, the role of DECC has been to 'manage down' expectations within a system that constrains growth and delivers 
defaultorganised
default underperformance across the sector.
default&#xa0;
default2.2 
defaultParliamentdefault 
defaulthas been misled by the claim that, under EU rules, FITs have to count against public expenditure defaultlimitsdefault. defaultThis UK interpretation has been held to despite the existence of a European court ruling (in Germany's 
defaultfavour
default) to the contrary. When asked, European Commission officials have consistently said that this is entirely down to UK interpretation rather than European determination.
default&#xa0;default2.3 In Germany, FITs are an independent element within energy sector accounting. They do not count as publicdefault defaultexpendituredefault. The government sets the tariffs and regulates their adjustment. The original UK 
defaultprogramme
default was designed to operate in the same way, until it was put into the Levy Control Framework in 2010.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.4 The effect of this has been to limit the ability of FITs to turn the existing UK energy cartel into more open and competitive energy market.
default&#xa0;
default2.5 
defaultThedefault 
defaultUK'sdefault 
defaultnarrowdefault 
defaultapproach to 'green' financial mechanisms defaulthas beendefault reinforced by itsdefault&#xa0;defaultdecision to pass all the costs ofdefault defaultFITs defaultprogrammesdefault to consumers, but none of the benefits.default In Germany there is a duty on the Grid to take 'clean' renewable energy (supported by FITs) before 'dirty'. This has led to a dramatic fall in their peak (wholesale) electricity prices and promoted substantial private investment in Green energy.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.6 
defaultUnder the EU Renewable Energy Directive, Member States are entitled to rule that renewable energy should be given priority defaultaccessdefault to their energy Grids.default The UK has chosendefault defaultnot to do sodefault. It is one of a
default small number of countries 
defaultpreferring to
default pursue protectionist policies in respect of 'old energy
default'
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.7 The effect of this disparity has been economically damaging to the UK. In the European wholesale
default 
defaultelectricity
default 
defaultmarket
default, UK 'forward power prices' are now 50% higher than Britain's major European competitors
default.
default&#xa0;
default3. The Green Investment Bank (GIB) or the defaultKfWdefault? default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.1 Most of the criticism of the
default Green Investmentdefault 
defaultBankdefault is really a critique of the constraints the government has imposed on it -
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRestricting its ability to borrow on the open 
defaultmarke
defaultt.
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLimiting the terms of 'State Aid' clearance it has been given, excluding most of the technologies (solar, hydro and onshore wind) that the 'community energy' sector could deploy most rapidly
default.
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRequiring it to pursue commercial rates of return
default.
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPrecluding it from having a lead role in energy efficiency (or interconnector) financing,
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOmitting any specific remit for the active promotion of 'community-owned' renewables,
default and
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLimiting its ability to 'de-risk' community energy schemes.
default&#xa0;
default3.2 This stands in stark contrast to the remit given to 
defaultGermany's defaultKfWdefault Development Bankdefault. 
defaultThe 
defaultKfW
default has an approach to Green Finance that includes the following -
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt has a 'promotional mandate', defined by government and backed by a formal 
default'Understanding'
default reached with the EU Commission.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIts 
defaultprogrammes
default have to be consistent with national commitments to

default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIncrease the share of renewable energy to 18% by 2020 (and 80% by 2050)
default•

defaultPhase out all nuclear power by 2022

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

defaultun
defaulttil 2050), and
default&#xa0;
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultReduce the primary energy consumption of buildings by 80% by 2050.
default&#xa0;
default3.3 The effect of this has been to make the 
defaultKfW
default a much more dynamic player in the German
default&#xa0;
defaultEnergiewende
default 
defaultprogramme
default than the GIB is allowed to be within
default the
default UK.
default&#xa0;
default3.4 Most specifically, the Committee needs to look at the role given to the 
defaultKfW
default in de-risking the German transformation process and in promoting it.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4. Simplicitydefault&#xa0;
default4.1 
defaultGermany directs the bulk of its transformation defaultprogrammesdefault through the defaultKfWdefault rather than Energy Utilities. defaultIt also cuts through much of the red tape that constrains UK access to Green Finance.
default&#xa0;
default4.2 
defaultThe defaultKfWdefault simplifies the process of applying for finance and then the trains high street/regional banks (defaultSparkassendefault) to deliver their finance defaultprogrammesdefault.default In 2011, they delivered 5,400 consulting services supporting this delivery mechanism. These covered energy efficiency measures as well as renewable energy investment.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.3 
defaultThe German government channels its EU-ETS receipts (approximately default€default1.5bn p.a.) through the defaultKfWdefault in order to de-risk investment in energy and climate work.
default&#xa0;
default4.4 
defaultStandardiseddefault application forms/procedures mean that loan applications are expected to be completed in a single visit to the local bank, once compliance conditions have been metdefault.
default&#xa0;
default4.5 
defaultLoans are normally at the rate of 1%-1.5% and can be for up to 15-20 years.default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default5. Energy Efficiencydefault&#xa0;

defaultconfused
default UK debate over ECO funding (through Utilities) or Green Deal (through its finance company), 
defaultthedefault 
defaultKfWdefault 
defaultdrivesdefault 
defaultGermany's energy efficiency defaultprogrammedefault -default5.2
default This streamlined access system, and 1.0%-1.5% interest rates, meant that in 2011 the defaultKfWdefault defaultdelivereddefault 360,000 whole house upgrades (and supported 370,000 jobs).default&#xa0;default5.3 Moreover, the 
default€
default10bn of public investment delivered 
default€
default27bn of private investment in the 
defaultprogramme
default.
default&#xa0;
default5.4 In addition to a general availability of low-interest loans, the 
defaultKfW
default offers additional support tied to the level of energy efficiency reached -
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.5 
defaultIn addition to a 1% loan rate, the defaultKfWdefault offers to write off up to 17.5% (now 20%) of the loan, if refurbishment reaches their 'near-zero' carbon homes standard.default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default5.6 No less important is a recognition that single measures attract no repayment bonus/debt relief.

default75,000.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default6default.default Critical lessons for the UK default&#xa0;
default6.1 The most consistent questions that arise in all the Anglo-German discussions I have been involved in are "Why does there seem to be one set of EU rules for the Germans and another for Britain?", or "Why is something that we are told would be a breach of State Aid rules in the UK, not
default count as
default one in Germany?".
default&#xa0;
default6.2 The most consistent answer is that
default (
defaultwith the exception of
default attempts to get
default new nuclear
default counted as 'Green' energy)
default British Ministers and officials usually 
defaultgo to the European Commission
default looking for a "No".
default&#xa0;
defaultA progressive and imaginative approach to financing the Green economy falls exactly into this category.
default&#xa0;
default     "The trouble with the British is that you can't take 'Yes' for an answer".
default&#xa0;
default6.3 From the insanely complex (and costly) structure of Green Deal, to the reliance on energy companies to deliver (over-priced) ECO refurbishment, to the retreat from national energy efficiency standards and the fixed-budget (and ever
default 
defaultchanging) constraints on renewable energy generation, 
defaultUK policies on Green Finance seem designed to defaultmarginalisedefault its role and to prop up the powers of the UK's existing energy carteldefault.
default&#xa0;
default6.4 The UK government has placed itself, and the GIB, in a secondary role in the energy transformation process. 
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTreasury interests in non-renewable energy usually trump DECC interests in renewables. 
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultProgrammes
default to radically reduce energy consumption get displaced in 
defaultfavour
default of lower regulatory requirements. 
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA race to the bottom has replaced the race to the top.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default6.5 In Denmark, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, France, Italy and Spain, as well as Germany, there are abundant examples of clearer, simpler frameworks that deliver Green Finance, on a transformational scale, against more ambitious national 'renewable energy' targets.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default6.6 The EU Is n
defaulteither
default the source of confusion in the UK's approach to 'Green Finance
default'
default, nor the straight jacket 
defaultthat the UK
default 
defaultis
default 
defaultcurrently 
defaulttied into. This appears to be Britain's unique contribution to Europe's energy transformation debate.
default It need not be so.
default&#xa0;
default6.7 
defaultA wider financial and policy remit given to the Green Investment Bankdefault, 
defaulta more authoritative lead from governmentdefault (in setting higher standards of energy performance, in direct procurement of additional inter-connectors, and in driving 'community ownership' models of Green investment) and 
defaulta simpler, unified system of access to low-cost financedefault are all needed to deliver a coherent framework of Green Finance in the UK.
