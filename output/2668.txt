[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“If the law allows electors to vote without personally visiting the polling booth, a detainee shall be allowed this prerogative 

[[[unless he has been deprived of the right to vote ]]]by law or by a court order” (emphasis added&#xa0;&#xa0;“the penitentiary system shall comprise the treatment of prisoners the essential aim of which shall be their reformation and social rehabilitation” . &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[(i)]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[individualisation]]] this principle  requires that  each prisoner’s sentence is tailored to the individual including consideration of the nature of the offence for which the sanction of imprisonment has been imposed;(ii)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[normalisation]]] this principle requires that the practice of good citizenship is fostered by a continuing contact with the values, responsibilities and realities that characterise daily life in the community;(iii)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[responsibility]]] this principle  requires  that prisoners should be given opportunities to exercise personal responsibility in daily prison life.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“10. The Committee is concerned at the State party’s maintenance of an old law that convicted prisoners may not exercise their right to vote. The Committee fails to discern the justification for such a practice in modern times, considering that it amounts to an additional punishment and that it does not contribute towards the prisoner’s reformation and social rehabilitation, contrary to article 10, paragraph 3, in conjunction with article 25 of the Covenant. The State party should reconsider its law depriving convicted prisoners of the right to vote.” &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;103.&#xa0;&#xa0;…..  the Court reiterates that although the margin of appreciation is wide, it is not all-embracing (see&#xa0;Hirst (no. 2)&#xa0;[GC], cited above, § 82). Moreover, as has already been noted in paragraph&#xa0;94&#xa0;above,&#xa0;

[[[the right to vote is not a privilege; in the twenty-first century, the presumption in a democratic State must be in favour of inclusion and universal suffrage has become the basic principle. In the light of modern-day penal policy and of current human rights standards, valid and convincing reasons should be put forward for the continued justification of maintaining such a general restriction on the right of prisoners to vote]]] ….106…. the Court is prepared to accept that, when sentencing, the Russian courts may indeed have regard to all those circumstances before choosing a sanction. 

[[[However, there is no evidence that, when deciding whether or not an immediate custodial sentence should be imposed, they take into account the fact that such a sentence will involve the disenfranchisement of the offender concerned, or that they can make any realistic assessment of the proportionality of disenfranchisement in the light of the particular circumstances of each case. It is therefore]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[not apparent, beyond the fact that a court considers it appropriate to impose a sentence of imprisonment, that there is any direct link between the facts of any individual case and the removal of the right to vote]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]107 … With a view to securing the rights guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, the 

[[[Contracting States may decide either to leave it to the courts to determine the proportionality of a measure restricting convicted prisoners’ voting rights, or to incorporate provisions into their laws defining the circumstances in which such a measure should be applied]]]. 

[[[In this latter case, it will be for the legislature itself to balance the competing interests in order to avoid any general,]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[automatic and indiscriminate]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[restriction.]]]

[[[(]]]Emphasis added

[[[)]]]

[[[ ]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“… further considers that the treatment as a single class of those with intellectual or mental disabilities is a questionable classification, and the&#xa0;curtailment of their rights must be subject to strict scrutiny. This approach is reflected in other instruments of international law, referred to above (paragraphs 14-17). The Court therefore concludes that an indiscriminate removal of voting rights, 

[[[without an individualised judicial evaluation]]] and solely based on a mental disability necessitating partial guardianship, cannot be considered compatible with the legitimate grounds for restricting the right to vote.&#xa0;There has accordingly been a violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention”.(emphasis added).&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“….

[[[Nor is there any place under the Convention system, where tolerance and broadmindedness are the acknowledged hallmarks of democratic society, for automatic disenfranchisement based purely on what might offend public opinion ]]](see&#xa0;Hirst (no. 2)&#xa0;[GC], cited above, § 70). According to the Court, this standard of tolerance does not prevent a democratic society from taking steps to protect itself against activities intended to destroy the rights or freedoms set forth in the Convention. Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, which enshrines the individual’s capacity to influence the composition of the law-making power, does not therefore exclude that restrictions on electoral rights could be imposed on an individual who has, for example, seriously abused a public position or whose conduct threatened to undermine the rule of law or democratic foundations. The severe measure of disenfranchisement must not, however, be resorted to lightly and the principle of proportionality requires a discernible and sufficient link between the sanction and the conduct and circumstances of the individual concerned.

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“The right not to be discriminated against in the enjoyment of the rights guaranteed under the Convention is also violated when States without an objective and reasonable justification fail to treat differently persons whose situations are significantly different.”&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;3. 

[[[SENTENCING AND ENFORCEMENT]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;“In the present case the applicant does not allege a difference of treatment based on the gravity of the offence he committed, but one based on his position as a prisoner serving a determinate sentence of more than fifteen years. 

[[[While sentence length bears some relationship to the perceived gravity of the offence, a number of other factors may also be relevant, including the sentencing judge's assessment of the risk posed by the applicant to the public.]]]” (emphasis added)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Recommendation Rec(2003)23]]]

[[[of the Committee of Ministers to member states]]]

[[[on the management by prison administrations ]]]

[[[of life sentence and other long-term prisoners]]]&#xa0;(Adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 9 October 2003at the 855th meeting of the Ministers’ Deputies)&#xa0;The Committee of Ministers, under the terms of Article 15.b of the Statute of the Council of Europe,&#xa0;Considering that it is in the Council of Europe member states’ interest to establish common principles regarding the enforcement of custodial sentences in order to strengthen international co-operation in this field;&#xa0;Considering that the enforcement of custodial sentences requires striking a balance between the objectives of ensuring security, good order and discipline in penal institutions, on the one hand, and providing prisoners with decent living conditions, active regimes and constructive preparations for release, on the other;&#xa0;Considering that prisoners should be managed in ways that are adapted to individual circumstances and consistent with principles of justice, equity and fairness;&#xa0;Referring to the resolution on the implementation of long-term sentences adopted in October 2001 by the European Ministers of Justice during their 24th Conference held in Moscow;&#xa0;Considering that the abolition of the death penalty in member states has resulted in an increase in the use of life sentences;&#xa0;Concerned about the increase, in many countries, in the number and length of long-term sentences, which contribute to prison overcrowding and may impair the effective and humane management of prisoners;&#xa0;Bearing in mind that implementation of the principles contained in Recommendation No. R (99) 22 concerning prison overcrowding and prison population inflation, as well as the provision to prison administrations of adequate resources and staff, would reduce to an important extent the management problems related to long-term imprisonment and allow for safer and better conditions of detention;&#xa0;Considering that legislation and practice concerning the management of life sentence and other long-term prisoners should comply with the requirements embodied in the European Convention on Human Rights and the case-law of the organs entrusted with its application;&#xa0;Bearing in mind the relevance of the principles contained in previous recommendations and in particular:&#xa0;–              Recommendation No. R (82) 16 on prison leave;–              Recommendation No. R (82) 17 concerning custody and treatment of dangerous prisoners;–              Recommendation No. R (84) 12 concerning foreign prisoners;–              Recommendation No. R (87) 3 on the European Prison Rules;–              Recommendation No. R (87) 20 on social reactions to juvenile delinquency;–              Recommendation No. R (89) 12 on education in prison; –              Recommendation No. R (92) 16 on the European rules on community sanctions and measures;–              Recommendation No. R (97) 12 on staff concerned with the implementation of sanctions and measures;–              Recommendation No. R (98) 7 concerning the ethical and organisational aspects of health care in prison;–              Recommendation No. R (99) 22 concerning prison overcrowding and prison population inflation;–              Recommendation Rec(2000)22 on improving the implementation of the European Rules on community sanctions and measures;–              Recommendation Rec(2003)22 on conditional release,&#xa0;Recommends that governments of member states:&#xa0;–               be guided in their legislation, policies and practice on the management of life sentence and other long-term prisoners by the principles contained in the appendix to this recommendation;–               ensure that this recommendation and the accompanying report are disseminated as widely as possible.&#xa0;

[[[Appendix to Recommendation Rec(2003)23]]]&#xa0;

[[[Definition of life sentence and long-term prisoners]]]&#xa0;1.              For the purposes of this recommendation, a life sentence prisoner is one serving a sentence of life imprisonment. A long-term prisoner is one serving a prison sentence or sentences totalling five years or more. &#xa0;

[[[General objectives]]]&#xa0;2.              The aims of the management of life sentence and other long-term prisoners should be:–               to ensure that prisons are safe and secure places for these prisoners and for all those who work with or visit them;–               to counteract the damaging effects of life and long-term imprisonment;–               to increase and improve the possibilities for these prisoners to be successfully resettled in society and to lead a law-abiding life following their release. &#xa0;

[[[General principles for the management of life sentence and other long-term prisoners]]]&#xa0;3.              Consideration should be given to the diversity of personal characteristics to be found among life sentence and long-term prisoners and account taken of them to make individual plans for the implementation of the sentence (individualisation principle). 4.              Prison life should be arranged so as to approximate as closely as possible to the realities of life in the community (normalisation principle).&#xa0;5.              Prisoners should be given opportunities to exercise personal responsibility in daily prison life (responsibility principle).&#xa0;6.              A clear distinction should be made between any risks posed by life sentence and other long-term prisoners to the external community, to themselves, to other prisoners and to those working in or visiting the prison (security and safety principle). &#xa0;7.              Consideration should be given to not segregating life sentence and other long-term prisoners on the sole ground of their sentence (non-segregation principle).&#xa0;8.              Individual planning for the management of the prisoner’s life or long-term sentence should aim at securing progressive movement through the prison system (progression principle).&#xa0;

[[[Sentence planning]]]&#xa0;9.              In order to achieve the general objectives and comply with the principles mentioned above, comprehensive sentence plans should be developed for each individual prisoner. These plans should be prepared and developed as far as possible with the active participation of the prisoner and, particularly towards the end of a detention period, in close co-operation with post-release supervision and other relevant authorities.&#xa0;10.              Sentence plans should include a risk and needs assessment of each prisoner and be used to provide a systematic approach to:&#xa0;–               the initial allocation of the prisoner;–               progressive movement through the prison system from more to less restrictive conditions with, ideally, a final phase spent under open conditions, preferably in the community; –               participation in work, education, training and other activities that provide for a purposeful use of time spent in prison and increase the chances of a successful resettlement after release;–               interventions and participation in programmes designed to address risks and needs so as to reduce disruptive behaviour in prison and re-offending after release;–               participation in leisure and other activities to prevent or counteract the damaging effects of long terms of imprisonment;–               conditions and supervision measures conducive to a law-abiding life and adjustment in the community after conditional release.&#xa0;11.               Sentence planning should start as early as possible following entry into prison, be reviewed at regular intervals and modified as necessary.&#xa0;

[[[Risk and needs assessments]]]&#xa0;12.              A careful appraisal should be made by the prison administration to determine whether individual prisoners pose risks to themselves and others. The range of risks assessed should include harm to self, to other prisoners, to persons working in or visiting the prison, or to the community, and the likelihood of escape, or of committing another serious offence on prison leave or release.&#xa0;13.              Needs assessments should seek to identify the personal needs and characteristics associated with the prisoner’s offence(s) and harmful behaviour (”criminogenic needs”). To the greatest extent possible, criminogenic needs should be addressed so as to reduce offences and harmful behaviour by prisoners both during detention and after release.&#xa0;14.              The initial risk and needs assessment should be conducted by appropriately trained staff and preferably take place in an assessment centre.&#xa0;15.              a. Use should be made of modern risk and needs assessment instruments as guides to decisions on the implementation of life and long-term sentences.&#xa0;b. Since risk and needs assessment instruments always contain a margin of error, they should never be the sole method used to inform decision-making but should be supplemented by other forms of assessment. &#xa0;              c. All risk and needs assessment instruments should be evaluated so that their strengths and weaknesses become known. &#xa0;16.              Since neither dangerousness nor criminogenic needs are intrinsically stable characteristics, risk and needs assessments should be repeated at intervals by appropriately trained staff to meet the requirements of sentence planning or when otherwise necessary.&#xa0;17.              Risk and needs assessments should always be related to the management of risks and needs. These assessments should therefore inform the choice of appropriate interventions or modifications of those already in place. &#xa0;

[[[Security and safety in prison]]]&#xa0;18.              a. The maintenance of control in prison should be based on the use of dynamic security, that is the development by staff of positive relationships with prisoners based on firmness and fairness, in combination with an understanding of their personal situation and any risk posed by individual prisoners. &#xa0;b. Where technical devices, such as alarms and closed circuit television are used, these should always be an adjunct to dynamic security methods.&#xa0;c. Within the limits necessary for security, the routine carrying of weapons, including firearms and truncheons, by persons in contact with prisoners should be prohibited within the prison perimeter.&#xa0;19.              a. Prison regimes should be organised so as to allow for flexible reactions to changing security and safety requirements. &#xa0;b. Allocation to particular prisons or wings of prisons should be based on comprehensive risk and needs assessments and the importance of placing prisoners in environments that, by taking account of their needs, are likely to reduce any risk posed. &#xa0;c. Particular risks and exceptional circumstances, including requests by prisoners themselves, may necessitate some form of segregation of individual prisoners. Intensive efforts should be made to avoid segregation or, if it must be used, to reduce the period of its use.&#xa0;20.              a. Maximum security units should be used only as a last resort and allocation to such units should be regularly reviewed.&#xa0;b. Within maximum security units, regimes should distinguish between the handling of prisoners who pose an exceptional risk of escape or danger should they succeed, and the handling of those posing risks to other prisoners and/or to those working in or visiting the prison. &#xa0;c. With due regard to prisoner behaviour and security requirements, regimes in maximum security units should aim to have a relaxed atmosphere, allow association between prisoners, freedom of movement within the unit and offer a range of activities.&#xa0;d. The management of dangerous prisoners should be guided by the principles embodied in Recommendation No. R (82) 17 concerning custody and treatment of dangerous prisoners.&#xa0;

[[[Counteracting the damaging effects of life and other long-term sentences]]]&#xa0;21.              In order to prevent and counteract the damaging effects of life and long-term sentences, prison administrations should seek:&#xa0;–               to ensure that opportunities are provided at the start of the sentence, and later as necessary, to explain to prisoners the prison rules and routine and their duties and rights;–               to provide prisoners with opportunities to make personal choices in as many of the affairs of daily prison life as possible;–               to offer adequate material conditions and opportunities for physical, intellectual and emotional stimulation;–               to develop a pleasant and user-friendly design of prison premises, furniture and decoration.&#xa0;22.              Special efforts should be made to prevent the breakdown of family ties. To this end:&#xa0;–               prisoners should be allocated, to the greatest extent possible, to prisons situated in proximity to their families or close relatives; –               letters, telephone calls and visits should be allowed with the maximum possible frequency and privacy. If such provision endangers safety or security, or if justified by risk assessment, these contacts may be accompanied by reasonable security measures, such as monitoring of correspondence and searches before and after visits. &#xa0;23.              a. Other contacts with the external world such as access to newspapers, radio and television and external visitors should also be fostered.&#xa0;              b. Particular efforts should be made to allow for the granting of various forms of prison leave, if necessary under escort, taking into account the principles set out in Recommendation No. R (82) 16 on prison leave. &#xa0;24.              Prisoners should have access to appropriate counselling, help and support in order:&#xa0;–               to come to terms with their offences, the harm done to victims and any associated guilt feelings;–               to reduce the risk of suicide, particularly directly after conviction;–               to counteract damaging effects of long-term detention, such as institutionalisation, passivity, lowered self-esteem and depression.&#xa0;

[[[Special categories of life sentence and other long-term prisoners]]]&#xa0;25.              Prison authorities should be mindful of the possibilities of repatriation for foreign prisoners as afforded by the European Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons or bilateral arrangements with the relevant country. Foreign prisoners should be informed of these possibilities. Where repatriation is not possible, prison management and practice should be guided by the principles of Recommendation No. R (84) 12 concerning foreign prisoners.  &#xa0;26.              Efforts should be made to protect vulnerable prisoners from threats and maltreatment by other prisoners. If protective segregation from other prisoners is necessary, complete isolation should be avoided and a safe and supportive environment provided. 27.              Action should be taken to allow for an early and specialist diagnosis of prisoners who are, or who become, mentally disturbed and to provide them with adequate treatment. The guidance given in Recommendation No. R (98) 7 concerning the ethical and organisational aspects of health care in prison should be followed. &#xa0;28.              Elderly prisoners should be assisted to maintain good standards of physical and mental health. To this end, the prison administration should provide: &#xa0;–               access to appropriate diagnostic and remedial services; –              opportunities for work, exercise and other activities that are suited to the individual prisoner’s physical and mental capacities;–               dietetically appropriate meals, taking into account special dietary needs.&#xa0;29.              a. In order to allow terminally ill prisoners to die with dignity, consideration should be given to releasing them so that they may be cared for and die outside prison. In each case, the prison administration should make every effort to provide these prisoners and their families with appropriate support and care. b. Appropriate help should also be given to assist these prisoners with any desired practical arrangements, for example, the making of a will, burial arrangements, etc. &#xa0;30.              a. Since women prisoners usually constitute a small minority of those serving long or life sentences, their individual sentence planning should be carefully considered so as to meet their specific needs. &#xa0;b. Particular efforts for women prisoners should be made to:&#xa0;–               avoid social isolation by merging them as far as possible with the general population of women prisoners; –               give access to special services for women prisoners who have been subject to physical, mental and sexual abuse.&#xa0;c. Mothers serving life or other long sentences should not be denied the opportunity of having their young children with them solely because of their sentence.  Where young children remain with their mother, the prison administration should provide appropriate conditions.&#xa0;31.              Special management care and attention should be given to the particular problems posed by prisoners who are likely to spend their natural life in prison. In particular, their sentence planning should be sufficiently dynamic and allow them to benefit from participation in meaningful activities and adequate programmes including interventions and psychosocial services designed to help them cope with their sentence. &#xa0;32.              a. Juvenile prisoners with long sentences of imprisonment should only be held in institutions or units designed for their special needs. &#xa0;              b. Regimes and sentence planning for these juveniles should be guided by the relevant principles set out in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and in Recommendation No. R (87) 20 on social reactions to juvenile delinquency, and pay particular attention to:&#xa0;–               the provision of adequate education and schooling;–               the need to maintain close contacts with their parents and family;–               the provision of adequate support and guidance in their emotional development;–               the availability of appropriate sport and leisure activities;–               the careful planning of the transition of a juvenile to an adult regime taking due account of the juvenile’s personal development.&#xa0;

[[[Managing reintegration into society for life sentence and other long-term prisoners]]]&#xa0;33.              In order to enable life sentence and other long-term prisoners to overcome the particular problem of moving from lengthy incarceration to a law-abiding life in the community, their release should be prepared well in advance and take particular account of the following:&#xa0;–               the need for specific pre-release and post-release plans which address relevant risks and needs;–               due consideration of the possibility of achieving release and the continuation post-release of any programmes, interventions or treatment undertaken by prisoners during detention;–               the need to achieve close collaboration between the prison administration and post-release supervising authorities, social and medical services.&#xa0;34.              The granting and implementation of conditional release for life sentence and other long-term prisoners should be guided by the principles set out in Recommendation Rec(2003)22 on conditional release.&#xa0;

[[[Recalled prisoners]]]&#xa0;35.              If, following revocation of conditional release, a life sentence or long-term prisoner is returned to prison, the principles enumerated in the foregoing should continue to be followed. In particular, a further assessment of risk and criminogenic needs should be undertaken and used for choosing a suitable allocation and further interventions, with the aim of preparing the prisoner for early reconsideration for release and resettlement in the community.&#xa0;

[[[Staff]]]&#xa0;36.              In general, the recruitment, selection, training, conditions of work and mobility, as well as the professional conduct of staff dealing with life sentence and other long-term prisoners, should be guided by the principles contained in Recommendation No. R (97) 12 on staff concerned with the implementation of sanctions and measures.&#xa0;37.              a. Since staff working with life sentence and long-term prisoners need to deal with the specific difficulties posed by these prisoners, they should be given the special training necessary for their duties. &#xa0;b. Staff should, in particular, be trained to have a full understanding of dynamic security so that they can use this approach to security in the performance of their duties. &#xa0;c. Senior, specialist and supervisory staff should, in addition, be trained to supervise and support the basic grade staff in the use of dynamic security.&#xa0;38.              Given the increased risk of manipulation of staff by prisoners serving long sentences, mobility and rotation of staff should be encouraged.&#xa0;39.              Regular meetings and discussions should be arranged between the different staff categories in order to achieve and maintain a proper balance between a sympathetic understanding of prisoner problems and firmness of control. &#xa0;

[[[Research]]]&#xa0;40.              Research on the effects of life and long sentences should be undertaken with special reference to the part played by factors that inhibit deleterious effects and promote a constructive adaptation to prison life. &#xa0;41.              Evaluative research should be conducted and published on the effectiveness of programmes designed to improve post-release adjustment in the community.&#xa0;

[[[ANNEX 3]]]Usually upon sentencing the Judge has read pre-sentence reports, expert reports such as psychiatric evaluations, letters from the offenders family, friends and colleagues. He has listened to the victim impact statement and, if the sentencing is as a result of trial proceedings, the Judge has become familiar with the offenders behaviour and personality. Pre-sentence reports should include an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offence and the impact on the victim. It often contains a detailed personal history, information relating to previous convictions, how the offender relates to others, if he is showing remorse and the likelihood of reoffending.  &#xa0;If the convicted person receives a community sentence, the Judge specifies the requirements of that sentence and that can impose, depending on age, unpaid work up to 300 hours, specific activities such as making amends to their victim, undertaking a programme to change their behaviour, prohibition from undertaking specified activities, an exclusion requirement, a residence requirement, a mental health treatment, a drug rehabilitation requirement,an alcohol treatment requirement, a supervision order, and a attendance centre order.&#xa0;Deportation - In the sentencing proceedings the Judge can recommend deportation, however the convicted foreign national should have been served with Form IM3, at least 7 days before the sentence. If the Judge does not recommend deportation the Secretary of State can still take deportation action.&#xa0;

[[[r]]]I.              INTRODUCTION&#xa0;1.              As noted in the Declaration adopted at the High-level Conference on the future of the European Court of Human Rights, organised by the United Kingdom Chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers (Brighton, 19-20 April 2012), “each State Party has undertaken to abide by the final judgments of the Court in any case to which they are a party. Through its supervision, the Committee of Ministers ensures that proper effect is given to the judgments of the Court, including by the implementation of general measures to resolve wider systemic issues… The Committee of Ministers must therefore effectively and fairly consider whether the measures taken by a State Party have resolved a violation. The Committee of Ministers should be able to take effective measures in respect of a State Party that fails to comply with its obligations under Article 46 of the Convention. The Committee of Ministers should pay particular attention to violations disclosing a systemic issue at national level, and should ensure that States Parties quickly and effectively implement pilot judgments”. The Declaration then invited the Committee of Ministers “to consider whether more effective measures are needed in respect of States that fail to implement judgments of the Court in a timely manner”. Following the Conference, the Committee of Ministers instructed the CDDH to submit its conclusions and possible proposals for action to follow up paragraph 29.d) of the Declaration. The deadline for this work has been set at 31 December 2013. The present report has been prepared in response to the Committee of Ministers’ instruction.&#xa0;2.              The Committee of Ministers’ Annual Reports on the supervision of execution of judgments contain statistics indicating the scale of the problem and its evolution over recent years. The following figures run from 2010, the year of entry into force of Protocol no. 14, which, as noted in that year’s Annual Report, was associated with an important number of new types of case, mainly clone or repetitive, due to the fact that the Court began issuing committee judgments in repetitive cases and the Committee of Ministers began supervising implementation of friendly settlements.The CDDH in particular notes that each year, the number of new cases continues to exceed the number closed, and that at present rates, it would take about ten years to close the current stock of cases, even were no new ones to arrive.&#xa0;3.              The present report will examine the issue raised in the terms of reference from the following perspectives:&#xa0;4.              The CDDH would also recall its work on issues relating to repetitive applications, given the fact that once the Court has given judgment, repetitive applications to the Court may represent a flow of related cases whose continuation is indicative of a failure to execute general measures intended to resolve the underlying systemic issue. In this connection, the CDDH has since the Brighton Conference transmitted to the Committee of Ministers a report on the advisability and modalities of a ‘representative application procedure’ and another containing conclusions and possible proposals for action on ways to resolve the large numbers of applications arising from systemic issues identified by the Court. The latter report in particular underlined the importance of execution of judgments and looked forward to more detailed treatment of the issue in the present report.&#xa0;5.              In the course of preparing the present report, the CDDH has, through the activities of Drafting Group “E” on the reform of the Court (GT-GDR-E), had the advantage of input from other parts of the Council of Europe, including the Committee of Ministers’ Ad-hoc working party on reform of the Human Rights Convention system (GT-REF.ECHR) and the Parliamentary Assembly, as well as extensive exchanges with representatives of civil society organisations and other independent experts, both in the course of meetings and through written contributions. The CDDH also recalls its earlier “practical proposals for the supervision of the execution of judgments of the Court in situations of slow execution”, which had included an invitation to a more in-depth reflection that it had declared itself ready to undertake. It further notes the on-going work of the Committee of Ministers, which covers also aspects going beyond the context of the present report.&#xa0;II.              ORIGINS OF THE PROBLEM&#xa0;6.              Broadly speaking, it can be said that there are three general causes of failure to execute judgments in a timely manner:Financial difficulties may be relevant to all or any of the above: for instance, general budgetary problems may lead to a reluctance to take political decisions allocating scarce resources to executing a judgment; or lack of resources in a particular body may hinder the search for technical solutions or prevent sufficient attention from being given to a problem.&#xa0;7.              Identification of the most suitable tool for responding to a problem depends on its cause. Reluctance to take action, for example, will require a response on the political level or which contains a political component. The provision of a Council of Europe technical assistance programme would be indicated in response to a technical problem.&#xa0;8.              The following sections group the various proposals into three categories, although it should be borne in mind that some proposals may have effects relevant to more than one category; they are included below in the category to which they are most relevant:&#xa0;III.              TOOLS TO FACILITATE SUPERVISION&#xa0;9.              

[[[The Committee of Ministers working in smaller groups during the supervision process.]]] The CDDH recalls an earlier proposal that “groups of Deputies, either of their own motion or at the instigation of their Government Agents, confronted with similar problems could meet to seek together solutions and elaborate draft resolutions for submission to the plenary Committee, in collaboration with the Department for the Execution of Judgments and other relevant bodies of the Council of Europe”. It notes the reluctance for the Committee of Ministers to address questions relating to supervision of execution of Court judgments in anything other than plenary composition but considers that there may be scope, in certain situations and/ or at certain stages of the procedure, for certain tasks to be performed by smaller groups.&#xa0;10.              

[[[More extensive/ systematic use of other bodies inside &amp; outside the Council of Europe]]], for instance the European Commission for Democracy through Law (Venice Commission) and the European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice (CEPEJ). It was noted that some developments were already under way, notably in relation to provision of technical assistance. In addition, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights could also contribute to the formal supervision process before the Committee of Ministers. It was also recalled that the Convention gives the role of supervising execution of Court judgments to the Committee of Ministers, which has a dedicated secretariat for this task. This latter brings to the attention of the Committee of Ministers all information about positions and potentialities of other Council of Europe bodies that could be useful in the framework of the execution of judgments, and to which the Committee of Ministers is always free to have recourse. This would have to be done without introducing new elements into the obligations flowing from a particular judgment. Nevertheless, certain bodies could become involved ‘by default’ in relation to certain categories of cases, for example the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) for relevant cases involving article 3 of the Convention. Lacking to date has been a detailed concrete plan, co-ordinated across the bodies concerned, which would provide the impetus necessary to institute these reforms. It has also been suggested that there be periodic meetings between the Committee of Ministers, the Parliamentary Assembly (in particular its Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights) and the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights to discuss issues relating to execution of judgments. (See also Section VI below.)&#xa0;11.              

[[[Appointment of ad hoc experts by the Committee of Ministers]]]. This proposal should be distinguished from the practice of recourse to outside experts as part of the technical assistance provided by the Department for the Execution of Judgments. It was noted that this could be a useful tool in exceptional circumstances. Such an expert would not audit or evaluate measures taken by a respondent State but conduct a needs assessment, evaluation of measures taken being the essence of the role of the Committee of Ministers. It was noted that the added value of a Committee of Ministers-appointed expert was uncertain, in the light of the fact that the practice of providing technical assistance had grown considerably in recent years.&#xa0;12.              

[[[The Court being more directive in its judgments on the measures needed.]]] It should first of all be noted that the Court has stated that “exceptionally, with a view to helping the respondent State to fulfil its obligations under Article 46, [it] will seek to indicate the type of measure that might be taken in order to put an end to a violation it has found to exist. In such circumstances, it may propose various options and leave the choice of measure and its implementation to the discretion of the State concerned. In certain cases, the nature of the violation found may be such as to leave no real choice as to the measures required to remedy it and the Court may decide to indicate only one such measure”. An example of the former is the pilot judgment in the case of Broniowski v. Poland, concerning the need for a domestic remedy providing compensation for property lost as a result of border changes following the Second World War. As to the latter type of case, in Oleksandr Volkov v. Ukraine, the Court directed the respondent State to ensure that the applicant be restored to his judicial post.&#xa0;13.              It was noted and, by some, welcomed that the Court has already developed its practice in this sense. At the same time, such a practice cannot be applied in every case or situation; the scope and content of judgments in individual cases must be left entirely to the Court’s discretion. Furthermore, the essential role of the Court is to determine whether or not protected rights and freedoms have been violated and, where necessary, to order the payment of just satisfaction. States are then free to choose the means by which to give effect to the Court’s judgments, subject to the supervision of the Committee of Ministers, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. There was some opposition to the further development of this practice, to the extent that it may run contrary to these considerations. Questions were also raised as to the extent to which directives on specific measures required for execution would be binding, including where circumstances change and the measures directed are no longer appropriate/ adequate. It has been suggested that problems in determining the measures necessary fully to execute a judgment are due not to a lack of precision in the judgment but to the fact that the judgment is based upon a specific case and may be open to different readings, depending on one’s perspective. Also, where there is uncertainty concerning the consequences of a judgment that depends on its interpretation, the CDDH recalls that article 46(3) of the Convention allows the Committee of Ministers to refer the matter to the Court for a ruling on the question of interpretation (see also below). In any case, the Committee of Ministers’ expectations of a satisfactory outcome to the process of implementation of a particular judgment must remain consistent with the judgment itself and preferably

[[[ ]]]should be clear from the outset.&#xa0;14.              

[[[More interaction between the Court and the Committee of Ministers]]], including through keeping one another informed of relevant developments (notably concerning systemic issues and repetitive applications, or introduction of an effective domestic remedy), taking synergistic actions (e.g. further Court judgments to clarify the legal/ factual situation concerning particular systemic issues, including pilot judgments) and co-ordination (e.g. where certain aspects of a case have already been transmitted to the Committee of Ministers whilst others remain pending before the Court). Such interaction already exists but it could usefully be further developed: for example, there may be problems of understanding/ interpretation of a judgment concerning a systemic issue for which an article 46(3) referral would not be the solution; instead, indications of general measures in subsequent judgments on related cases may better help clarify the requirements. Taking account of a subsequent Court judgment could however only be justified in exceptional cases and should not involve suspending closure of a case, at the risk of unduly prolonging the process. Any interaction must respect the fact that the Convention gives to the Committee of Ministers competence to determine whether the measures proposed and subsequently taken by a respondent State are adequate (subject only to the possibility of referral to the Court under article 46(4)). &#xa0;15.              

[[[Appointment of a ‘special rapporteur’]]] who would act, in direct partnership with the Department for the Execution of Judgments (which would become autonomous within the Council of Europe), as an independent advisor to the Committee of Ministers on the measures needed for execution of a judgment and on possible action in response to particular situations. As originally made, this proposal would involve an official appointed by the Committee of Ministers from amongst a list of personalities fulfilling the usual requirements of competence, impartiality and high moral character. This official would be auxiliary to the Committee of Ministers, providing an independent and objective assessment of the specific circumstances of judgments whose implementation is subject to supervision. This assessment would be accompanied by proposals to the Committee of Ministers, including on measures that may be required as part of effective implementation of a judgment and on measures that could be taken to promote and encourage full implementation. The official could also decide which cases should be given publicity; for example, Committee of Ministers’ decisions, examples of good practice or instances of particularly unsatisfactory implementation. Deciding whether a judgment had been effectively implemented would, however, remain the exclusive competence of the Committee of Ministers.&#xa0;16.              Issues requiring further examination include whether or not the official would have a status analogous to the various United Nations’ Special Rapporteurs/ Representatives; whether the function should be a new office within the Council of Europe or be discharged by an existing one; and whether or not its creation would require amendment of the Convention (the proposal provisionally concluded that this would not be the case). More detailed consideration would have to be given to the precise criteria and procedure for appointment and functions of the new official, and their exact position in the organisation and role in the supervision process.&#xa0;17.              The proposal argued that the introduction of such an official would give an autonomous dynamic thrust to the otherwise essentially inter-governmental process; the absence of such an independent, pro-active institutional actor hindered the Committee of Ministers’ capability to adopt incisive decisions, especially in cases of doubt over a State’s compliance with a judgment. Experience with such organs as the committee of experts of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages or the Advisory Committee of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities shows how the Committee of Ministers may exercise its political competence more incisively when supported by the independent assessment of a dedicated official. The existence of such an official could help avoid confrontation between States over controversial issues, by allowing an independent actor to take initiatives. The very fact of establishment and existence of such an official would underline the importance of execution of judgments and the political priority attached to it by the Committee of Ministers. The costs involved would be relatively small, being limited to the expenses connected to the post itself; this would represent excellent value for money when set against the cost of delayed or incomplete execution of judgments in both financial, including for the Court and the Committee of Ministers, and human terms. There was some support for the proposal.&#xa0;18.              There were, however, widespread doubts about the added value of such a mechanism and, relatedly, concerns also about the possible high budgetary consequences of its implementation. It was underlined that Respondent States remain free to choose the most appropriate means to give effect to a particular judgment. It was felt that the Department for the Execution of Judgments, along with technical assistance programmes and, potentially, a more systematic recourse to the expertise of other Council of Europe bodies (see further below), had sufficient competence and qualifications as sources of support to the work of the Committee of Ministers. Concern was expressed that a new official could create uncertainty as to the different responsibilities of the various actors and complicate the supervision process, with the risk of delay: it was suggested that a better approach would be to reinforce the capacity of the Department for the Execution of Judgments to support States through close bilateral co-operation. The need was expressed for greater clarity of the proposal and a better understanding of how it was supposed to work in practice. Even for some supporters of the proposal, it was felt that it would not be appropriate for such an official to decide on giving publicity to what this latter considered to be instances of particularly unsatisfactory implementation.&#xa0;19.              As a variation on the proposal, it was suggested that whilst any ‘special rapporteur’ should not duplicate existing functions, there could be added value in a role as a conduit by which the views of and information from civil society and other external actors would be distilled and transmitted to the Committee of Ministers. This could facilitate the work of national delegations in digesting the varied mass of information available on the very large number of cases on the Committee of Ministers’ agenda. Such a post could be located within the Department for the Execution of Judgments, or, with greater autonomy, the Office of the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights. In response, it was felt that the Committee of Ministers should continue to receive, without prior filtering, all communications concerning a particular case and that the aim of the proposal could be achieved by a better presentation of relevant information within the existing frameworks. &#xa0;IV.              TOOLS TO ENCOURAGE FULL EXECUTION&#xa0;20.              

[[[Recognition of good practice]]] in the execution of judgments could be further developed, including, for example, by giving publicity to resolutions or decisions when a State has particularly effectively or rapidly executed a judgment, or even when it has made notable progress towards full implementation, while good cooperation with states could also be further reflected in the Annual Reports. There should also be readily accessible information on the current state of progress in implementing both individual and general measures. Procedurally, full execution of a judgment should rapidly be followed by closure of the execution process and reflection of this in the relevant statistics. It is also important that decisions and resolutions be effectively disseminated to domestic authorities, in accordance with Committee of Ministers’ Recommendation CM/Res(2008)2 on efficient domestic capacity for rapid execution of judgments of the European Court of Human Rights.&#xa0;21.              

[[[Use of proceedings under article 46(4) of the Convention]]], made possible upon the entry into force of Protocol no. 14 in June 2010. This mechanism has not yet been used by the Committee of Ministers, although it is understood that occasional requests have been made by applicants for the Committee of Ministers to consider using it. A possible practical obstacle to use of the provision may be the fact that delegations in the Committee of Ministers could be reluctant to call for a vote, given the need for a two-thirds majority decision. In order to dispel any uncertainty about the exact meaning of the provision, the CDDH recalls that the Explanatory Report to Protocol no. 14 clarifies that the expression “a High Contracting Party refuses to abide” covers refusal whether “expressly or through its conduct”.&#xa0;22.              The CDDH recognises the potential of the Article 46(4) procedure, which is intended to assess whether a judgment has been implemented: the response to non-implementation would remain a matter for the Committee of Ministers. At the same time, the CDDH appreciates that its use must be considered with especial caution.  &#xa0;23.              With a view to exploring different approaches to the use of this provision, it has been suggested that it could be made one of a (formalised) series of steps in response to failure to execute (see Graduated set of tools below). The procedure may be particularly suitable where there is dispute as to the efficacy of measures taken; in which case, it should be recalled that proceedings could also culminate in a finding that the State in question has in fact adequately implemented the judgment, so that the Committee of Ministers would then close its supervision.&#xa0;24.              It was also argued that any introduction of measures even stronger than article 46(4) should only be after the Committee of Ministers has actually used its existing powers, including under article 46(4).&#xa0;25.              

[[[Astreintes/ financial penalties/ punitive damages]]]

[[[.]]] A proposal to introduce a system of astreintes was originally made by the Parliamentary Assembly in 2000 and reiterated in 2002 and 2004, during the process involving the Rome Conference and the preparation of the 2004 reform package. In its reply to the 2000 Recommendation, the Committee of Ministers considered that “the idea of a system of financial penalties (“astreintes”) … and, in particular, the practicalities of such a proposal, merit very thorough examination”, whilst noting that “the introduction of such a system into the control mechanisms instituted by the Convention raises a number of questions… In any event, persistent failure to execute judgments already carries financial consequences: the risk of being obliged to award just satisfaction to other persons affected by a persistent violation of the Convention may already bring with it a considerable economic pressure on the respondent State.” A proposal to introduce financial sanctions imposed by the Committee of Ministers did not attract consensus prior to the Brighton Conference; opinions in the CDDH are also clearly divided for and against proposals of this type (i.e. for measures whether ordered by the Committee of Ministers or the Court), as follows.&#xa0;26.              Amongst the concerns and objections that have been expressed are the following:-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; States Parties did not sign up to a system involving punitive measures. To introduce such unusual and radical measures for non-timely execution of judgments now would change the nature of the Convention system.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Any system of astreintes etc. would have to be effective in rectifying underlying systemic problems, not merely in requiring States to pay compensation/ damages. -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It could be said that the money involved would be better spent on resolving the underlying systemic problems. Indeed, financial difficulties may be a reason for non-execution of certain judgments; financial sanctions or punitive damages may only exacerbate this situation.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Committee of Ministers may find it difficult to decide to apply a financial penalty, were it to be competent for doing so, given that it has not so far made use of article 46(4) (see further above).-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It would be premature to consider the introduction of coercive measures before the effectiveness in practice of article 46(4) had been tested.&#xa0;27.              Positive reaction to the proposal varies from interest in further exploration to strong support of some. It has been argued that financial incentives would be the strongest to ensure execution of judgments. It has been said that in some situations, it is ‘cheaper’ for the respondent State to pay successive sums of just satisfaction than to resolve the underlying systemic issue: a financial penalty could help rebalance this calculation in favour of the latter and compliance with Convention obligations.&#xa0;28.              Issues requiring further exploration would include the following. It would be hard to quantify the potential efficacy of financial penalties, which would have to be set at a level high enough to be an effective incentive but not so high as to impair the State’s ability to implement the judgment, especially in situations of budgetary difficulty. It may also be necessary to accommodate the fact that not all States are equally wealthy, in order to equalise the impact of any penalty. For all these reasons, there would need to be an element of discretionary decision-making as to the amount of a penalty, begging the question as to who would exercise this discretion. The Court may have the necessary impartiality, but such a competence would to some extent change the nature of its relationship with the States Parties. There is, moreover, currently no legal provision for the Court to take punitive measures against States: it has never been competent to take such decisions and would have to be, in an appropriate manner, empowered to do so. In the present context, this would require an amendment of the Convention and not merely a Committee of Ministers resolution, as was the case for introduction of the pilot judgment procedure. Were the Court to be given competence to take punitive measures, it could at the same time be given greater competence to be directive in its judgments (see para. 12 above). Even were decisions on application of financial penalties to be taken by the Court, it is unclear how the process would be initiated, given that the Committee of Ministers is responsible for supervision of execution of judgments but has not so far made use of article 46(4).&#xa0;29.              It was suggested that the Court could pass on its costs incurred in processing repetitive applications to the respondent State as an additional charge through a system ensuring that victims of such violations obtain redress without any significant additional administrative burden on the Court. Another option could be a requirement to pay civil-type damages to the Committee of Ministers as compensation for resources expended on prolonged supervision of execution of judgments in cases of persistent systemic issues. Such measures would not, however, strictly speaking be punitive but rather of a reparative nature, although some of the effects may be similar. In response, it was pointed out that the Court could not be considered as suffering ‘damage’ on account of having to deal with repetitive applications, as it exists and is financed by the member States to deal with all individual applications regardless of their nature; a similar consideration would apply to the proceedings before the Committee of Ministers. It was also suggested that both measures would require amendment of the Convention.&#xa0;30.              Overall, the CDDH did not envisage the possibility of consensus on the issue in the foreseeable future but did not exclude all possibility of its being further discussed should the situation change in future.&#xa0;31.              

[[[‘Naming and shaming’]]] as a form of pressure: the Committee of Ministers could adopt a practice of being more critical and publicise its findings to that effect. The CDDH notes that in other contexts, Council of Europe bodies – for example, MONEYVAL (see further below) and the CPT – do use publicity as a response to failures in compliance. Concern was expressed that this was not necessarily the best way of obtaining execution: it does not help to identify solutions, which is better achieved by providing effective support to States, and tends to block discussion with the authorities, who if they feel stigmatised may defend their position. Certainly it should not be used indiscriminately, without regard to the consequences; it may be more suitable to clear procedural failings – e.g. non-presentation of an Action Plan – than to contestable substantive matters. There was no consensus in support of a use of publicity that would amount to ‘naming and shaming’. In the past, the Committee of Ministers has used publicity not to ‘name and shame’ but to inform the public about problems in execution and in its own supervisory work (through e.g. press releases, Annual Reports): this has had some results on the domestic political level and should be encouraged and developed (see ‘recognition of good practice’ above). Some aspects of the supervision process can be and, in fact long have been made public by administrative initiative, e.g. statistics and lists of long-pending cases: these resources could in future be made more accessible. A more effective approach may for this to be done following a transitional period during which outstanding procedural failures could be corrected. ‘Naming and shaming’ may have a part to play in the more political processes of the Parliamentary Assembly, when acting to promote execution of judgments.&#xa0;32.              

[[[Graduated use of tools according to an agreed, pre-determined sequence]]] could clarify the relative significance of particular measures taken by the Committee of Ministers in response to delay in execution. The CDDH notes that the Council of Europe’s Committee of experts on Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures and the Financing of Terrorism (MONEYVAL) employs graduated steps as part of ‘compliance enhancing procedures’ with respect to States found not to be in compliance with reference standards or the committee’s recommendations. It has been suggested that, in the context of supervision of execution of judgments, application of each successive tool or measure could be triggered automatically in accordance with a specified time-frame – which could be set, at least in part, by reference to that indicated in the respondent State’s action plan – subject to any decision to the contrary. Even if cases are different and the responses to them may need to differ, there could nevertheless be an established sequence of responses, subject to a certain flexibility, with no more than a rebuttable presumption that after a certain period of time, consideration will be given to taking the next measure. The importance of flexibility and the adaptability of responses to particular circumstances has, however, been underlined. It was therefore considered that the available measures could rather constitute a ‘toolkit’ (or list of tools/ measures), which could be based on the measures examined by the GT-REF.ECHR (see para. 5 and footnote 6 above).&#xa0;33.              The use of 

[[[peer pressure to overcome persistent difficulties to execute]]] has been a constant part of Committee of Ministers’ practice and a certain number of tools have been developed in response to concrete situations. A certain number of additional measures have been discussed but never implemented by the Committee of Ministers. In the opinion of the CDDH these measures should remain in the toolkit available to the Committee of Ministers. Nevertheless, there may be doubts as to their appropriateness for obtaining acceleration of execution measures, as such a potentially confrontational approach may undermine the dialogue between the Committee of Ministers and a respondent State.&#xa0;34.              On a more positive note, encouragement or support could be given to bilateral co-operation between a State faced with a particular systemic issue and another that has already successfully executed a judgment involving a similar issue (see also para. 9). This could also be considered a part of the Council of Europe’s technical assistance (see Section VI below).&#xa0;35.              

[[[Role of national parliaments.]]] Similarly, the CDDH recalls that national parliaments have an important role to play in the process of execution of judgments and could be encouraged to intervene in appropriate cases.&#xa0;V.              TOOLS TO ENHANCE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE COMMITTEE OF MINISTERS AND NON-COUNCIL OF EUROPE ACTORS&#xa0;36.              

[[[Increasing applicants’ understanding of the process,]]] including by making them aware that the process continues after adoption of a judgment and that they may still have a role to play. It reflects the fact that the Committee of Ministers is a political organ but supervision is a legal process. One should not, however, create a further adversarial stage nor excessively systematise exchanges of information and submissions before the Committee of Ministers. The purpose of submission of information should be to contribute to better implementation of judgments, in particular to determination of whether a particular judgment is fully executed. This does not extend, however, to the question of how that judgment should be executed: States are free to choose the most appropriate means of effectively achieving the result. When they receive the Court’s judgment, applicants and their representatives are informed in general terms about the supervision process and provided with the contact details of the Department for the Execution of Judgments. It was suggested that they could also be informed when supervision is to be closed. Furthermore, applicants could receive copies of all information transmitted by the government to the Committee of Ministers. Applicants should not, however, be systematically invited to respond to every communication from the respondent State; instead, they should be allowed to act as and when they consider necessary – anything more would only create an additional and unnecessary burden for the Department for the Execution of Judgments, whose resources are already limited.&#xa0;37.              Applicants and the general public may not understand the significance of all the procedural terms used: for example, the term ‘execution’ has an unfortunate, predominant connotation in English, and use of the term ‘resolution’ for various measures of differing procedural significance may be confusing. A relatively simple step that could promote better understanding of the supervision process would be review and, where necessary, revision of the terminology used, which may also be in the interests of the Committee of Ministers.&#xa0;38.              

[[[Amending Rule 9]]]

[[[ to remove the distinction between injured parties (i.e. applicants) and NGOs/NHRIs as regards the possibility of addressing general measures]]]. This proposal received some support, with certain reservations. It was noted that increasing numbers of judgments depend on implementation of general measures for their full execution, and that it may be difficult for an individual applicant to comment on the issues involved; indeed, questions were raised as to the competence of individuals to provide an objective assessment of general measures, or even the legitimacy of such interventions. Again, it should be emphasised that in every case, the aim must be to improve implementation of judgments: interaction between the Committee of Ministers and other actors is not an end in itself.&#xa0;39.              

[[[Encouraging applicants to communicate with the Committee of Ministers (including by raising awareness of Rule 9)]]] could be done in exceptional cases but should not become the standard practice. The Secretariat should be encouraged to propose taking this step to the Committee of Ministers where appropriate. Once again, the aim of communications with the Committee of Ministers can only be to improve the supervision process. Also in this connection, it may be that the variant on the ‘special rapporteur’ proposal, giving any such official a role in channelling information from third parties to the Committee of Ministers, could play a part in appropriately encouraging applicants to submit communications.&#xa0;40.              

[[[Involvement of national human rights institutions and Ombudsmen]]], who have the right in principle to make representations. The CDDH recalled the UN’s ‘Paris Principles’, which state that national human rights institutions “shall co-operate with regional institutions … that are competent in the areas of the promotion and protection of human rights”. At the same time, it notes that some such bodies’ mandates may not allow them to take such action or may be uncertain on the matter.&#xa0;41.              Following on from the previous two proposals, one could also envisage amendment of Rule 9 to allow for the possibility of comments from another international organisation, which is not currently explicitly foreseen.&#xa0;42.              

[[[Formalisation of the process of civil society organisations giving briefings to permanent representations]]], building on the existing practice of informal, ad hoc briefings. The CDDH does not consider that it would be advantageous to formalise an existing practice.  What is important is that the Committee of Ministers can avail itself of information from a range of sources before reaching its decisions. In this connection, the above proposals, notably those connected to Rule 9, can be considered as a package.&#xa0;VI.              COUNCIL OF EUROPE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND ITS TARGETTING&#xa0;43.              The CDDH recalls the importance of Council of Europe technical assistance to facilitate full execution of judgments. In this context, the Secretary General’s proposals were discussed at the May 2013 Ministerial Session, and it can be noted that within the Council of Europe, a relative emphasis is currently being given to co-operation activities. The CDDH recalls its examination of this issue in its recent Report containing conclusions and possible proposals for action on ways to resolve the large numbers of applications arising from systemic issues identified by the Court. &#xa0;44.              Assistance may be of two types, addressing systemic issues (which requires large-scale, lengthy, complex programmes) or specific interventions (involving precise, sometimes very rapid action to help overcome particular technical difficulties; such activities may not require extensive resources).&#xa0;45.              It is clear that there is a need for co-ordination between Council of Europe co-operation activities in order better to target execution problems. It should be made easier to realign projects in response to changing circumstances (e.g. a new judgment of the Court on the issue in question), through increased flexibility in the administration and implementation of projects.&#xa0;46.              The CDDH itself could be deployed as a forum for the exchange of good practices. It has in the past prepared various recommendations and guides to good practice on issues of common interest, including both general capacity for implementing judgments and solutions to specific problems; this could be further pursued in future, with new issues being addressed and existing reports and instruments up-dated. More direct and flexible approaches to exchange of information could also be investigated.&#xa0;47.              The CDDH also considers that further attention should be given to resolving possible differences in priority between donors and the requirements of execution of Court judgments. Whilst technical assistance should follow broad strategic objectives, the central importance of the Convention system to human rights protection in Europe and the States Parties’ obligation to execute Court judgments suggest that the requirements of execution should be borne in mind when designing and implementing assistance programmes.&#xa0;48.              Similarly, the CDDH reaffirms the importance of cooperation between the Council of Europe and the European Union, in particular to ensure the continued funding and effective implementation of joint programmes and coherence between their respective priorities in this field (see the Brighton Declaration, para. 9.i)).

[[[ANNEX 5]]]Extract from the Brighton Declaration&#xa0;High Level Conference on the Future of the European Court of Human Rights Brighton Declaration…F.      Execution of judgments of the Court&#xa0;26.   Each State Party has undertaken to abide by the final judgments of the Court in any case to which they are a party. Through its supervision, the Committee of Ministers ensures that proper effect is given to the judgments of the Court, including by the implementation of general measures to resolve wider systemic issues.&#xa0;27.   The Committee of Ministers must therefore effectively and fairly consider whether the measures taken by a State Party have resolved a violation. The Committee of Ministers should be able to take effective measures in respect of a State Party that fails to comply with its obligations under Article 46 of the Convention. The Committee of Ministers should pay particular attention to violations disclosing a systemic issue at national level, and should ensure that States Parties quickly and effectively implement pilot judgments.&#xa0;28.   The Committee of Ministers is supervising the execution of an ever-increasing number of judgments. As the Court works through the potentially well-founded applications pending before it, the volume of work for the Committee of Ministers can be expected to increase further.&#xa0;29.   The Conference therefore:a)       Encourages the States Parties:i)         to develop domestic capacities and mechanisms to ensure the rapid execution of the Court’s judgments, including through implementation of Recommendation 2008(2) of the Committee of Ministers, and to share good practices in this respect;ii)       to make action plans for the execution of judgments as widely accessible as possible, including where possible through their publication in national languages; andiii)      to facilitate the important role of national parliaments in scrutinising the effectiveness of implementation measures taken;b)      Reiterates the invitation made by the Interlaken and Izmir Conferences to the Committee of Ministers to apply fully the principle of subsidiarity by which the States Parties may choose how to fulfil their obligations under the Convention;c)       Invites the Committee of Ministers to continue to consider how to refine its procedures so as to ensure effective supervision of the execution of judgments, in particular through:i)         more structured consideration of strategic and systemic issues at its meetings; andii)       stronger publicity about its meetings;d)      Invites the Committee of Ministers to consider whether more effective measures are needed in respect of States that fail to implement judgments of the Court in a timely manner; ande)       Welcomes the Parliamentary Assembly’s regular reports and debates on the execution of judgments.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;              The Reform Acts of 1832 and1867 extended the franchise to a wider group of property holders , but tright to vote was still dependent on being a property holder               These being the right to property, the right to education and parental choice in education and the duty to hold free elections.               Simpson, AWB., Human Rights and the End of Empire, Oxford University Press  at 758               although the UK had not opposed the inclusion of a similar term in the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948               Simpson, AWB, Human Rights and the End of Empire, Oxford University Press 2001 at Chapter 15               However, at the negotiations of the main Convention in early 1950, Sir Oscar Dowson, the UK delegate, noted some of the practical difficulties which including provisions about elections would raise. He referred to “the impossibility of reaching agreement on what precisely are the fundamental principles of democracy” and further noted that, in his view:               “It is probable that the suffrage is as wide in the United Kingdom as in any other country; yet even in the United Kingdom as in any other country it is inaccurate to speak to the suffrage as ‘universal’.  In no State is the right to vote enjoyed even by those without qualifications.  The qualifications required differ from State to State…  And it is our view that the variety of circumstances to be considered may justify the imposition of a variety of qualifications, as a condition of the exercise of suffrage.”               See generally , Dirk van Zyl Smit and Sonja Snacken, Principles of European prison law and policy, Oxford University press 2009 Ch 1 the history of European Prison law and policy                Committee of Ministers Resolution (Recommendation 195) on the Electoral Civil and Social Rights of Prisoners (CoM Resolution 1962) https://wcd.coe.int/com.instranet.InstraServlet?command=com.instranet.CmdBlobGet&amp;InstranetImage=579964&amp;SecMode=1&amp;DocId=618654&amp;Usage=2               CoM Resolution 1962 at paragraph 3               CoM Resolution 1962 at paragraph 5               International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  GA Res 2200A (XXI) 16 December 1966 (ICCPR)               Article 10 (3) of the ICCPR               Both the Scoppola and Anchugov judgments set out the other applicable international standard which include Arts 10 and 25 of the ICCPR and the UNHRC’s General Comment No 25on this issue               Concluding Observations of the Human Rights Committee: United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 12/06/2001 CCPR/CP/73/UK at paragraph 10 http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/CCPR.CO.73.UK%3BCCPR.CO.73.UKOT.En               Anchugov and Gladkov v Russia [2013] ECHR Cases 11157/04 and 15162/05               Anchugov and Gladkov v Russia  (2013) at 103               Anchugov and Gladkov v Russia  (2013) at 106               Anchugov and Gladkov v Russia  (2013) at 107               Scoppola v Italy (No 3) [2012] ECHR 868               Scoppola v Italy (No. 3) (2012) at paragraph 92               Alajos Kiss v Hungary [2010] ECHR Case number 38832/06               Alajos Kiss v Hungary (2010) at paragraph 44               Article XXIII(6)  - (“6) Nem rendelkezik választójoggal az, akit bűncselekmény elkövetése vagy belátási képességének korlátozottsága miatt a bíróság a választójogbólkizárt.” which translates as (6) A person shall not have a right to vote who, as a result of having committed a criminal offence or having limited [mental?] capacity, has had his voting rights excluded by a Court.               Scoppola v Italy (No. 3) (2012) at paragraph 46               Scoppola v Italy (No. 3) (2012) at paragraphs 47 and 48               Hirst v UK (No 2) [2005] ECHR 681 at paragraph 70                Anchugov and Gladkov v Russia  (2013) at 107               Thlimmenos v Greece [2000] ECHR 162                Thlimmenos v Greece [2000] at paragraph 44               Thlimmenos v Greece (2000) at paragraph 47               Clift v.

See the Guidelines to each of these on the Sentencing Council’s website here: http://sentencingcouncil.judiciary.gov.uk/guidelines/guidelines-to-download.htm In the Recommendation and this submission, a life-sentence prisoner refers to a prisoner serving life imprisonment and a long-term prisoner refers to a prisoner serving a sentence/s totalling five years or more. (Appendix to Recommendation at paragraph 1). It should be noted that a life sentence does not necessarily mean that the prisoner will be imprisoned for the term of his natural life. The majority of countries make provision for a review of life sentences with the possibility of granting release from prison (Explanatory Memorandum paragraph 12).   As noted at the 12th Conference of Directors of Prison Administrations (26-28 November 1997) and bearing in mind Resolution (76) 2 on the treatment of long-term prisoners. See also http://www.prisonstudies.org/ for recent statistics on the rising prison population in most European countries. For example, the prison population in the United Kingdom was 66,301 in 2001, which had increased to 74,103 by January 2005.  The Committee consisted of government experts from Belgium, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Lithuania, Moldova, Romania, "the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia", Turkey, Ukraine and the United Kingdom. Ms Hilde Tubex (Belgium), Mr Klaus Koepsel (Germany) and Mr Norman Bishop (Sweden).  See Prison Reform Trust Barred From Voting (2001). Available at http://www.prisonreformtrust.org.uk/file_25_5_2001.html  These figures are based on the prison populations of those countries that impose a total or partial ban on prisoner’s voting rights, including: Russia, Germany, Italy, France, Romania, The United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Belgium, Austria, Estonia, Norway, Armenia, Luxembourg, Malta and San Marino.

Para. 29.d) For these purposes, a ‘leading’ case is defined in the Annual Reports as one which has been “identified as revealing a new structural or general problem in a respondent state and which thus may require the adoption of new general measures more or less important according to the case”. See docs. CDDH(2013)R77 Addendum IV and CDDH(2013)R78 Addendum III respectively. See in particular Sections VII and X. See in particular the working document “Measures to improve the execution of judgments and decisions of the Court (doc. GT-REF.ECHR(2013)2 rev2) and the “Memorandum on the Parliamentary Assembly’s proposal to introduce a system of financial sanctions or astreintes on states who fail to implement judgments of the Strasbourg Court” (doc. GT-GDR-E(2013)002). See in particular the Open Society Justice Initiative briefing paper on supervision of execution of judgments of the Court (doc. GT-GDR-E(2013)005), the proposals by Professor Bultrini concerning supervision by the Committee of Ministers of execution of judgments (doc. GT-GDR-E(2013)006) and the observations by the European Trade Union Confederation (doc. GT-GDR-E(2013)3). See doc. CDDH(2008)014 Addendum II. See the CDDH Final Report on measures that result from the Interlaken Declaration that do not require amendment of the ECHR, doc. CDDH(2010)013 Addendum I, para. 8.iii. For further details, see doc. CDDH(2013)R78 Addendum III, Section VIII. A decision to this effect has in fact already been taken: see the ‘Declaration of the Committee of Ministers on sustained action to ensure the effectiveness of the implementation of the European Convention on Human Rights at national and European levels’, adopted at the 116th Ministerial Session, 19 May 2006, para. X.c. See e.g. Fatullayev v. Azerbaijan, App. no. 40984/07, judgment of 22 April 2010, para. 174; in this case, the Court ordered the respondent State to release the applicant from detention.  App. no. 31443/96, Grand Chamber judgment of 22 June 2004, para. 194. App. no. 21722/11, judgment of 9 January 2013, paras. 202 &amp; 208. The Court in this judgment also indicated that the respondent State should implement certain general reforms of its legal system. See “Proposals by Prof. [A.] Bultrini concerning supervision by the Committee of Ministers of execution of judgment”, doc. GT-GDR-E(2013)006. See para. 98 of the Explanatory Report. See PACE Recommendations 1477 (2000) on execution of judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, para. ii and 2546 (2002) on implementation of decisions of the European Court of Human Rights, para. 4, and Opinion No. 251 on draft Protocol No. 14, para. 5. See doc. CM/Del/Dec(2000)779/4.2. The Committee of Ministers’ reply to the 2002 Recommendation referred back to the earlier reply. See doc. GT-REF.ECHR(2013)2 rev2, p.6.
