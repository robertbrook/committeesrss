defaultEU action to tackle youth unemploymentdefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultWith around 1,000,000 young people not employed, in education or training in the UK youth employment is a serious issue not just for today but, without joined-up action, a critical challenge of all of our futures. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFor young people getting good advice, guidance and support is crucial. Yet, despite the dire circumstances, there is a shortage of official support for careers guidance, work experience and work-skills preparation. It is not only young people that suffer as employers are also short-changed by a system that fails to provide a work-ready supply of eager new talent. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFortunately the response to these issues from the voluntary and youth sector is extremely encouraging and some brilliant outcomes are being achieved by islands of excellence sprinkled across the country. Unfortunately there has been no integration and little leverage of these various support avenues for young people, schools and colleges or indeed employers. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTo facilitate our youth and all those who need their talent Youth Employment UK is the only not-for-profit campaigning and membership organisation dedicated to bringing everything available to support youth unemployment into one single access point.  Through joined-up action Youth Employment UK serves all parties; our youth, those who support their development and all those employing organisations who provide work experience, internships and employment for our young people.

defaultMy name is Keshav Bhatt and I'm 23 years old. After graduating and doing some travelling I had a crazy idea in my head and was bouncing around looking for how I could transform my 
defaultpassion into a profession. I wanted to create an education curriculum that prepared young people for real life. For the real issues &amp; real life decisions they face. How do we really create a better world if we don't know enough about it? Youth Employment UK has supported me beyond belief - from getting me on Sky News live (in HD!) to introducing me to an Australian millionaire mentor to give me hints, tips and advice for starting my business.

defaultIf you need to step up, YEUK is the place to help you.”

defaultMarcus Lee, Head of Resourcing and Early in Career at Santander, said: “We were delighted to be offered the opportunity to become prime sponsor of Youth Employment UK.   The great work that YEUK does will complement the appetite Santander UK has in creating a greater number of opportunities to support the youth employability agenda”.
default&#xa0;default1. Do you think that the EU should be providing funding to Members States to tackle youth unemployment? Does the EU action respect Member States powers in the area of social and employment affairs?defaultFunding is needed to help tackle youth unemployment but it must align to the individual needs and issues of each Member State.  There also needs to be a better accountability for how that funding is spent, understanding what programmes work and ensuring greater investment for successful schemes.  
default&#xa0;
default2. How do you think that the EU can best “add value” to Member States’ efforts to tackle unemployment?default&#xa0;
defaultSharing of good practice and benchmarking against meaningful* criteria is also fundamental and a value that the EU can add to all Member States
default&#xa0;
default*Employment persistence across sectors
default&#xa0;
default3. Is there sufficient disaggregation in EU measures to tackle youth unemployment between, for example, support for young people classified as being not in education, employment or training (‘NEETs’), support for newly qualified graduates looking for work, and general career guidance?default&#xa0;
defaultThere are a raft measures to support NEET’s and the data is quite robust.  Graduates and young people making transitions from education to work do not have consistent access to the same level of services or careers guidance that is available to NEET young people.
default&#xa0;
default5. How do you think the funds allocated though the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) and the Europeans Social Find (ESF) could best be spent?default&#xa0;defaultBy making sure that funding opportunities are is clearly accessible for all youth organisations and partnerships to access.  
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have specific examples of funding opportunities that were made available but due to poor communication and promotion where not known to interested parties that could a have access such funds.
default&#xa0;
defaultBy ensuring funding is targeted towards specific outcomes.
default&#xa0;
defaultIf youth unemployment funding was used to fully fund apprenticeships for micro and small businesses there would be an opportunity for greater economic growth and a reduced opportunity for wasted investment.
default&#xa0;default6. Do you feel that young people (aged 15-24), youth groups and their representatives are involved and consulted to a satisfactory degree in the decisions being made around EU funding for youth unemployment projects, and how they are administered?default&#xa0;defaultNo, not nearly enough.  Young people are very passionate and engaged on this topic, they also have some really creative ideas which should be tapped in to.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn 2012 we undertook a survey of young people on their thoughts on youth unemployment and ideas on how to tackle youth unemployment responses included;
default&#xa0;
defaultFrom: Amy defaultAge: 17default&#xa0;
defaultI believe that the number of NEETS is so high as most jobs require previous experience or other qualifications that we have not yet gained. Also, the fact that many people claim dole actually receive more money than a young person on minimum wage. I have had two jobs since I was 16 whilst attending school then college, yet my elder sister is claiming dole and receives more money than me. I felt as though there was no point in working all the time which drained me and attending college when I could sit around doing nothing and get paid more.
default&#xa0;defaultFrom JamesdefaultAge: 19default&#xa0;defaultCareers information I got at school was really poor, I didn’t want to go to University and the advisor was not able to help me with other options and I felt really worried.  I spent lots of time looking for help but it was difficult to find out what was there for me.  There are so many websites and it is really confusing.  The jobcentre did not seem to want to do anything other than get me to sign paperwork.  I wanted to work but without help or the chance of work experience I was really stuck.  I have found work now, but it was not easy. Government needs to make it easier for us to access help and find out about all of the opportunities we could take.
default&#xa0;
defaultHolly who is an ambassador for Youth Employment UK said “I am lucky, I have always known what I want to do after University and had a natural understanding of how to make that happen.  But I know hundreds of fellow students who are now struggling to find their place in the world of work.  As a YEUK ambassador I have begun to see all of the amazing opportunities and investment for young people but also see how hard it is to identify when there is so much going on.  That is why I am a big supporter of YEUK the work they are doing and their approach is unique and vital if we are to help the unemployed and underemployed youth of today”
default&#xa0;default8.  How can the EU and Member States embrace new technologies and new methods of working to combat youth unemployment?default&#xa0;
defaultFollow the example of young people and use the platforms that they use.
