defaultWritten evidence from Hawkins and Associates Ltd (SLC 037)
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThis submission has been prepared by R B Newbery of Hawkins and Associates Ltd (Hawkins) on behalf of Hawkins.
default  Hawkins is a forensic science and engineering consultancy, which
default, amongst numerous other types of incident
default,
default 
defaultinvestigates
default 
defaultrail accidents; 
defaultour investigations have included
default the Ladbroke Grove, Hatfield and Potters Bar derailments (I gave evidence at the Inq
defaultuest).  We also 
defaultinvestigate 
defaultroad traffic accidents, which has led us through our work with motor insurers to investigate 
defaulta number of 
defaultaccidents at level crossings.  
defaultWe have also investigated accidents involving pedestrians at level crossings.  
defaultWe have given
default evidence 
defaulton such cases 
defaultin civil and criminal courts.  
default&#xa0;
defaultI became aware of this inquiry relatively late in the proceedings, but was told that a submission from Hawkins could still be considered.  
defaultAs a result
default, before preparing this submission I have had the
default benefit of viewing 
defaultthose
default prepared by others, so this submission consists of a number of observations from our work which do not appear
default to have been covered by others
default and I have 
defaulttried 
defaultnot 
defaultto repeat
default observations already made by others
default:
default&#xa0;
default1.
default              
defaultMany users of 
defaultautomatic half-barrier crossings (AHB
defaultC
default) are not aware of the intentionally short time between the amber 
defaultlight coming on and the train
default arriving (as little as 27 seconds).  
default&#xa0;
default2.
default              
defaultThe meanings of signs and lights at level crossings are not well understood.
default&#xa0;
default3.
default              
defaultIt is likely that few pedestrians have any experience of deciding if it is safe to cross ahead of a 
default‘
defaultvehicle
default’
default t
defaultravelling at 100 miles per hour, 
defaultas permitted 
defaultat
default AHB
defaultC
default and 
defaultuser worked crossings (UWC).  In the case of
default 
defaultfootpath or bridleway crossings
default, speeds o
defaultf up to 125
default&#xa0;
defaultmph can be permitted
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.
default              
defaultThe removal of all level crossings from the network in 
defaultthe 
defaultshort term would be prohibitively expensive
default,
default therefore education is possibly the most effective way of improving safety at level crossings.
default&#xa0;
default1.
default              
defaultAutomatic half-
defaultbarrier crossings (AHB
defaultC)
default&#xa0;
default1.1
default              
defaultMany of the accidents that we have investigated involving vehicles have been at AHB
defaultCs
default.  I expect the committee will be aware of the report of the public enquiry into the accident at Hixon level crossing 
defaultin
default 196
default8
default1
default 
defaultand the report
default by British Railway Board on level crossing protection published in 1978
default2
default.  
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default              
defaultThe latter report 
defaultstates 
defaultthat the aim of the report was
default:
default 
default“t
defaulto consider ways in which methods of level crossing protection can be further developed in Great Britain, taking int
defaulto account the cost and need to maintain an adequate and 
defaultpublically
default acceptable standard of safety - and to make recommendations
default.”
default  The general background section started 
default“It was immediately evident to us that progress towards automated level crossings in Britain had come to 
defaulta 
defaultvirtual standstill since the Hixon enquiry in 1968 whereas progress in Europe had been most 
defaultim
defaultpressive.”
default  Therefore 
default“
defaultW
defaulte considered that our first tas
defaultk should be to determine 
defaulthow and whether AHB should be simplified to make them cheaper to install and maintain without affecting their present excellent safety records.
default  We had made a number of recommendations which we believe should satisfy both aims”.
default&#xa0;
default1
default.3
default              
defaultRecommendations from these documents have been carried through into standards which are current at the time of writing this submission, but these standards do not explain the rationales behind them.  In particular, with respect to AHB crossings, the rep
defaultort recommended 
default“A basic time-cycle of 27 seconds for crossings up to 15 m long”
default.  This was a reduction in the length of time
default from how such crossings were set up previously
default; the concern was that longer time cycles would encourage road users to zig
default&#x2011;
defaultzag betw
defaulteen the barriers.  I
defaultt seems that it was anticipated that i
defaultf it became common experience that trains would arrive so
defaulton after the barriers descended, 
defaultth
defaulten
default drivers will be less willing to take the risk
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.4
default              
defaultThe 
defaultinformation
default that the time 
defaultbetween the barriers descending 
defaultand the train arriving 
defaultat AHBCs is
default deliberately low does not appear to be readily available to members of the public - it is certainly not mentioned in the Highway Code.  Neither is it mentioned in 
default“Using level crossings saf
defaultely”
default 
default3
default, a document prepared by the Office of Rail Regulation (
defaultthe 
defaultcopy I have is undated, but it is not recent).
default&#xa0;
default1.5
default              
defaultHMRI’s
default Guidance on Level Crossings
default4
default includes the following: 
default“The time elapsed between the amber lights of the road traffic light signals 
defaultstarting to show and the train arriving at the crossing should not be less than 27 seconds.  The train should pass as soon after 27
default&#xa0;
defaultseconds as possible.  At least 95% of trains should arrive within 75
default&#xa0;
defaultseconds and 50% within 50 seconds, once the sequence of
default events to close the crossing to traffic has begun”
default).
default&#xa0;
default1.6
default              
defaultThe short time between the barriers descending and the train arriving on AHBC is certainly in contrast to the long waits that are often experienced at full barrier crossings, which are usually oper
defaultated from a 
defaultꞋ
defaultlocal
defaultꞋ 
defaultsignal box (local does not mean that all such crossings are readily viewed from the signal box - many are viewed 
defaultvia CCTV).  The lack of understanding of the short time between the barriers descending and the train arriving, coupled wit
defaulth 
defaulta
default possible route across the crossing by avoiding the half barriers has led to some well publicised near misses, including a recent one involving a cyclist at the Waterbeach crossing close to our offices in Cambridge
default (I investigated a fatal accident at th
defaultat crossing some years ago)
default.  
default&#xa0;
default1.7
default              
defaultIn addition, if some trains do take a long time to arrive 
defaultat AHBCs 
defaultafter the crossing sequence starts, as I found to be the case during an investigation into an accident in South Wales (at least one train took over three
default minutes to arrive and others over two minutes) then the 
defaultꞋ
defaultmessage
defaultꞋ 
defaultthat trains arrived soon after the crossing sequence starts, will be diluted.
default&#xa0;
default1.8
default              
defaultOne of the reasons for the difference in time between trains arriving at crossings after the amber light 
defaulthas come on is that most AHBC are operated by an electro-mechanical treadle at a fixed distance from the crossing.  The distance is defined as the distance that a train travelling at ‘line speed’, the speed limit for the track will travel in 27
default&#xa0;
defaultseconds.  I
defaultt can be appreciated that a goods train travelling at say 40
default&#xa0;
defaultmph
default will take much longer to travel the same distance (about 
default68
default&#xa0;
defaultseconds).  If there is a station close to the crossing at which s
defaulto
defaultme trains stop and some do not, the treadle needs to be set for t
defaulthe trains that do not stop.
default 
default&#xa0;
default1.9
default              
defaultThere are two 
defaultshort 
defaultstretches of track, one in Norfolk
default (Norwich to Cromer)
default and one 
defaultwhich crosses between
default Bedfordshire
default and Buckinghamshire
default (Bedford to Bletchley)
default, where a different system is used to operate the 
defaultAHBCs
default, which
default takes into account the speed of an approaching train and delays the start of the crossing sequence accordingly.  I do not know why such a system has not bee
defaultn
default used elsew
defaulth
defaultere.
default&#xa0;
default2.
default              
defaultThe meaning of signs and lights at crossings are not well understood
default&#xa0;
default2.1
default              
defaultThe
default approaches to level crossings 
defaultwhere a road crosses the track 
defaultare required to include a multiplicity of signs.  One in particular, which advises the drivers of long or slow vehicles to stop and call the signal box
default,
default contains more information than it is poss
defaultible for a driver to read whilst moving.  Few drivers are likely to stop and read it.  I am aware of 
defaultthree
default occasions where the contents of the notice w
defaultere
default generally 
defaultꞋ
defaultunderstood
defaultꞋ
default, but w
defaultere
default misinterpreted.  The signs say 
default“Drivers of large or slow vehicles mu
defaultst phone and get permission to cross”
default.  The definitions of large and slow are given in smaller print further down the notice and 
defaultꞋ
defaultslow
defaultꞋ 
defaultis defined at 5
default&#xa0;
defaultmph or less.  In all three cases
default, the drivers of the vehicles did not think that 
defaultꞋ
defaultslow
defaultꞋ 
defaultapplied to them
default,
default because their vehicles were capable of travelling at 
defaultmore
default than 5
default&#xa0;
defaultmph, although they had probably had to slow to 
defaultabout 5
default&#xa0;
defaultmph or less because of local
default circumstances.
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default              
defaultAnother aspect of level crossings is there is no positive 
defaultꞋ
defaultgo
defaultꞋ 
defaultsignal.  The absence of
default a signal 
defaulteffectively 
defaultmeans 
defaultꞋ
defaultgo
defaultꞋ
default.  Therefore a driver approaching a crossing and seeing no signal 
defaultis likely to
default consider it safe to cross.  If a driver did not notice the signal because of bright sunlight he or she might c
defaultontinue across the crossing.  I
default&#xa0;
defaultcon
defaultsider that this was probably a factor in two of my investigations.  Network Rail is aware of the potential problem of a low su
defaultn shining directly onto the lights, i.e. from behind the driver, thus maki
defaultng the light less obvious.  Where
default this is likely to be a
default problem long hoods are put over the lights, but it is 
defaultnot clear to me that the effect
default on
default defaultvisibility when the sun is directly in front of the driver is so well understood
default, although it is referred to by RAIB in its submission
default.  A driver approaching traffic 
defaultlights under such circumstances would know that a light of some colour would be displayed, so will probably check carefully to see what colour 
defaultlight was showing
default before proceeding.  In the case of level crossings, if no light is perceived that could be taken to mean a 
default‘
defaultgo
default’
default signal and the driver 
defaultmight then proceed on
defaultto the crossing.  
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default              
defaultI have read a report where a driver apparently thought that the flashing red
default signal meant it was okay to proceed with caution!
default&#xa0;
default2.
default4
default              
defaultI d
defaulto not know how expensive it would
default be to include green lig
defaulthts in level crossing signals
default.  
defaultThe changes to the electrical circuit that would be required would be very simple.
default&#xa0;
default3.
default              
defaultAssessing train speed
default&#xa0;
default3.1
default              
defaultFew people regularly cross roads where the speed limit is more than 40 mph and many people
default’
defaults experience is limited to crossing roads where the speed limit is 30
default&#xa0;
defaultmph.  Thus, many pedestrians who cross at AHB
defaultC
default, user work
defaulted
default crossing
defaults
default (UWC)
default,
default or footpath or bridleway crossings
default,
default are poor at assessing the speed of an oncoming train.  Trains are permitted to pass over such crossings at up to 100
default&#xa0;
defaultmph.  
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default              
defaultThe difficulty of assessing a speed of oncoming vehicles when they are travelling straight
default towards an observer are described in 
defaultthe text book 
default“Forensic aspects of driver perception and response”
default,
default 3
defaultrd
default Edition by Paul L Olson
default,
default Robert Dewar and Eugene Farber, Lawyers and Judges Publishing Company Inc 2010.  
defaultThis subject is dealt with at some length but includes the following observations: 
default“When the path of the other vehicle is close to being directly towards or away from the observer, the primary closing speed cue, and perhaps the sole cue, is 
defaultrate
default of change 
defaultof image size.  That is, if the object seems to be getting larger fast, that indicates a high closing speed.  The difficulty here is that this cue to closing speed depends not only on closing speed, but also on separation distance.  At large separation dis
defaulttances, the apparent size changes slowly regardless of closing speed.”
default 
default  To paraphrase an example given in the text:  If a train is observed when 1,000 feet (305 metres) away, by the time it has reached 500 feet (152
default&#xa0;
defaultmetres) away the image size of the trai
defaultn will have doubled.  When the train has covered half the distance to the observer so that is 250
default&#xa0;
defaultfeet (76
default&#xa0;
defaultmetres) away its image size will have double
defaultd
default again, but in 
defaulthalf 
defaultthe time it took to double in size before.
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default              
defaultThe size of an approaching vehicle a
defaultlso affects the perception of its speed: 
default“One phenomenon at work is the “large object illusion” - the perception that large objects are moving more slowly than small ones traveling at the same speed.  Most of us have experienced the impression that a jumbo
default jet approaching an airport seems to be moving slowly, while a very small aircraft moving at the same speed appears to be traveling quite fast.  
default(Trains are large by comparison with road vehicles.)  
defaultIn addition, there is virtually no lateral motion (a good
default cue to speed) in the perception of an approaching train when the driver 
default(or pedestrian)
default is close to the tracks.  Drivers often fail to take the speed of trains into account, relying primarily on an estimate of their distance.”
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default              
defaultThere is also an effect of age on 
defaultan
default observer’s ability to assess the speed of oncoming vehicles as described in 
defaulta paper by
default Hoffmann published in the Journal 
defaultof 
defaultPerception 
defaultin 
default1994
default6
default.  
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default              
defaultThe situation can be even worse at night.  Trains often have only a
default single light on the front, equivalent to a dipped headlight on a car.  Assessing the speed of an approaching train if there is no ambient lighting then becomes almost impossible.
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default              
defaultIn summary, many pedestrians will not appreciate how quickly a train wi
defaultll arrive at their position so will attempt to cross the track when it is not safe to do so.  
default&#xa0;
default4.
default              
defaultConclusion
default&#xa0;
default4.1
default              
defaultI understand that no new level crossings are being built and Network Rail is taking the opportunity wherever possible to remove crossings from the network, but to remove them all in the short-term would be prohibitively expensive.  
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default              
defaultI find it surprisi
defaultng that the Highway Code has so little information about level crossings, and even more surprising that a document prepared by the Office of Rail Regulations does not mention the deliberately short time between the barriers coming down and the train arrivi
defaultng at AHB
defaultC
default.  
defaultI
defaults
default the 
defaultpauc
defaultity of information in the Highway Code a deliberate attempt to try to keep the Highway Code 
defaultshort to make it easier to read?  I do not recall receiving any 
defaultꞋ
defaulttraining
defaultꞋ 
defaulton level crossings when learning to drive or even when preparing 
defaultfor and taking my advance
defaultd
default training test.  It has to be acknowledged that few people read the Highway Code after passing their test and the driving test is insufficient to prepare people for 
defaultꞋ
defaultreal
defaultꞋ 
defaultdriving, but that is another subject.
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default              
defaultI recall Networ
defaultk Rail carrying out a publicity campaign about safety on level crossings fairly recently and I suspect that attempts to educate drivers through campaigns such as that 
defaultare
default the most sensible way to proceed.  To be effective, any such publicity campaign needs
default to send the appropriate messages and based on my investigation of level crossing accidents these messages could perhaps include:
