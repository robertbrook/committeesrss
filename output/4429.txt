[[[Introduction]]]The 

[[[Association of Directors o]]]

[[[f Environment, Economy, Planning &amp; Transport (ADEPT)]]] represents local authority county, unitary and metropolitan Directors who manage some of the most pressing issues facing the UK today.  Operating at the strategic tier of local government, we are responsible for delivering public services that primarily relate to the physical environment and the economy, but which have a significant impact on all aspects of the nation’s well-being.At the local level, ADEPT members, with our wide-ranging responsibilities and cross-cutting professional knowledge, have a unique understanding of the opportunities and barriers facing their respective places.  Because we start from a place-based approach, we automatically join up policy areas that in Whitehall are spread across a number of different Departments.&#xa0; We therefore see ourselves as having a key role in supporting and helping to deliver sustainable economic growth and quality of life and are keen to work with Government, business and the voluntary sector to make the most of the opportunities available.Although our members are predominately from English authorities, we are closely affiliated with CSS Wales, the Society of Chief Officers of Transport in Scotland (SCOTS) and the Northern Ireland Road Service: Senior figures from these organisations play an active role on the ADEPT management board. &#xa0; 

[[[The Planning Officers Society]]] was formed in April 1997 by the amalgamation of the former County Planning Officers Society, District Planning Officers Society and the Metropolitan Planning Officers Society. With the formation of a single Local Government Association it was decided by the constituent societies that a single voice for local authority planning practitioners would be the most effective way of pursuing good and effective planning practice within local government. In March 2011 POS became a Registered Charity.The Society's aim is to ensure that planning makes a major contribution to achieving sustainable developments, from national to local level, in ways, which are fair and equitable and achieve the social economic and environmental aspirations of all sectors of the community.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Local highway and transport authorities are publicly accountable bodies and recognised by their communities as being responsible for the roads and transport systems within the areas.  They are best placed to understand the problems and make decisions on behalf of their communities.&#xa0;1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The allocation and bidding mechanisms for local transport expenditure have been undergoing change for many years.  Annual bids for funding using Transport Policies and Programmes submissions were replaced from 2001 by five-yearly Local Transport Plans which bid for five year allocations of block funding for Integrated Transport and Maintenance, while retaining a separate bidding round for major schemes over £5 million.  Subsequently, in December 2010, the bidding process for block allocations was replaced by an indicative allocation based on calculated formulae.&#xa0;1.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The benefits of these changes in relation to block funding to local authorities have been:&#xa0;1.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; When the Department for Transport announced their decision to devolve decision-making on local major transport schemes in September 2012 their stated reasons were that it will: 1.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Local authorities generally welcomed the principle of devolving decision-making and accountability to the local level, and finding ways of delivering schemes which minimise the administrative burden and costs on both central and local government.&#xa0;1.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; However, many felt that the arrangements proposed in the consultation paper fell far short of the optimum means of achieving this.  The (then) proposed Local Transport Bodies created further layers of unnecessary bureaucracy, which would complicate decision making and inevitably lead to additional costs.  &#xa0;1.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Subsequently, the decision to allocate large amounts of transport funding via the Single Local Growth Fund to Local Enterprise Partnerships has created considerable complexity in terms of how Local Transport Bodies work.  We believe this has the capacity to undermine the original rationale by which decision-making for local major transport schemes was to be devolved as real power is not being handed to local communities.  In addition, apart from the already confirmed figures for each LTB area (which represents only a small proportion of the total funding demand), we understand that the initial funding announcement in July 2014 will only confirm a funding allocation for 2015/16, which does not provide the certainty that authorities need to deliver major schemes whose construction is likely to span financial years, or indeed the impetus to expedite preparation of schemes when there is no certainty of future funding.&#xa0;1.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The competitive element of the Single Local Growth Fund came as something of a surprise to authorities and does not provide long-term certainty compared to a formulaic allocation of funding via Local Transport Bodies.  Given the importance of this funding to the local economy, we believe that the short timescales which have been given for the preparation of Strategic Economic Plans will not produce an optimal result in ensuring that allocated funding does align properly with need.&#xa0;1.9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The creation of new organisations, Local Transport Bodies, to administer devolved local major transport scheme funding created unnecessary bureaucracy.  The allocation of funding to Local Enterprise Partnerships means that since local authorities are responsible for the promotion and delivery of most schemes, three organisations are now involved in what would now seem to be an unnecessary and convoluted decision-making process with accountability still lying with the Local Highway authority as part of their statutory duties.&#xa0;1.10&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We believe that a far more effective model would be to follow the original proposal for devolution of funding via a formulaic process (perhaps amended to encompass wider priorities), but with funding allocated directly to local authorities who are the Highway and Transport Authorities. Associated with this should be a requirement for local authorities to demonstrate meaningful engagement with their local business communities and LEPs, instead of the heavy-handed evaluation process that is being recommended by the Department for Transport. Local authorities are publicly accountable bodies with formal scrutiny arrangements and engagement with local communities and businesses is now second nature. &#xa0;1.11&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Giving responsibility for spending decisions to the LEP does effectively engage stakeholders from&#xa0;the business community.&#xa0; However, it risks decision making being based on a narrow viewpoint without the full understanding of the evidence base or of competing policy objectives.

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.1              Most upper-tier local authorities maintain or can call on a professional team of highway and transport officers with a wide breadth of experience across the field and a deep knowledge of the transport issues facing their localities.  The capacity of any authority with respect to major transport schemes is heavily linked to the level and certainty of funding which is available for delivery of such schemes.  When funding is short, there is inevitably a vicious circle in that local authorities will not maintain capacity at a level beyond that which they can reasonably expect to be justified.  However, the structures are already in place which would allow that capacity to be easily expanded to meet the needs of increased funding, but an element of up-front pump-priming is needed to allow short-term expansion or a long-term funding commitment so that local authorities can have confidence to expand their capacity.  2.2              Local Transport Authorities have spent decades through the TPP and LTP process analysing and understanding local transport issues and through evidence based policy determining the transport measures appropriate to the needs of local people and businesses. &#xa0;&#xa0; The most efficient means for LEPs and LTBs to undertake these functions is to engage with existing expertise within their constituent Local Authorities.2.3              The professional team supports and advises elected Councillors who are able to directly reflect the views and priorities of their constituents in their decision making.  Elected member structures included either an elected Mayor or a Cabinet portfolio structure with executive responsibility and established scrutiny mechanisms.  Budget and consultation processes are well established, and engagement with the private sector takes place through the Local Enterprise Partnerships and more directly when needed.2.4              Together, the professional officers and elected members are already responsible for local major transport schemes from problem identification through to delivery, with the only decisions which are taken elsewhere being the statutory processes (such as Side Roads Orders and Compulsory Purchase Orders) and the allocation of funding which are both undertaken by the Department for Transport. However, local authorities are increasingly expected to procure or provide a significant amount of the funding and to bear risk of cost-over runs.2.5              Local Enterprise Partnerships will maintain a similar team of professional officers with knowledge of strategic leadership, ambition and vehicles for identifying clear investment priorities and interventions necessary to stimulate private sector led economic growth.  However, very few Local enterprise Partnerships have specialised knowledge of the assessment, prioritisation and delivery of local transport schemes, relying on their local highway/transport authorities for advice in this area.2.6              We believe that the optimum delivery body already exists – in the shape of local highway and transport authorities – who already possess all the skills and democratic accountability to assess, prioritise and deliver local transport schemes.3.1              Local authorities have dealt with schemes crossing their boundaries for many years without the need to establish complicated arrangements.  The usual arrangement has been to reach agreement that one authority acts as lead for promotion and delivery of the scheme.  This has worked well on many occasions and there is no need to establish bureaucratic structures to enable such schemes, particularly if funding mechanisms – such as formulaic allocations – encourage local authorities to work in partnership rather than competition with each other.3.2              We therefore believe that funding should be allocated to local authority level, and where a cross-border issue exists it should be funded jointly by those authorities affected as, if it is a major issue, it will already be recognised as such by all those involved.3.3              An over-arching regional body is likely to be in a position to determine wider benefits but is unlikely to prioritise schemes with primarily local impacts.4.1              Viewed nationally, the relationship is obviously mixed, reflecting different histories and priorities.  Engagement between local authorities and the business community (including Local Enterprise Partnerships) will be stronger in some areas than others.  4.2              We believe that overlapping LEPs create frequent tensions and unnecessary bureaucracy in establishing priorities and common delivery agendas.4.3              We also believe that there are frequent examples of government departments not supporting common agendas, such as past actions by the Highways Agency, whether due to policy or pursuit of performance indicators with respect to congestion on their network, which have tended to inhibit development.  The over-proscriptive regime laid down by the Department for Transport for Local Transport Bodies does not encourage true localism and the principles of devolution.5.1               The local authority road network represents 98% of England’s roads by length and carries two-third of all road traffic, and we do not believe that the importance of this network is recognised in the amount of funding made available for investment.  While we are aware that there has been significant variation in the funding available over time, we have not been able to find clear figures to demonstrate this point, and would suggest that it would be useful for the Select Committee to ask the Department for Transport to produce their spending figures on local major transport schemes over the last 30 years, to show both the relative changes and the frequent changes in funding levels.5.2               Local Major Transport Schemes are complex and time-consuming projects.  Choosing the most appropriate route requires extensive consultation and environmental analysis.  In addition, statutory orders are required, which mean that for most schemes the preparatory process will take a period of years, and cost a seven-figure sum.  Any funding stream which includes a bidding process therefore means that local authorities must expend considerable time and cost in preparing schemes with no certainty that they will be funded, particularly where an advanced state of scheme preparation means that a scheme will have a greater chance of success in bidding.5.3              In more recent times, the much reduced level of funding available for major schemes, together with the uncertainty of the bidding process has meant that if a scheme is unsuccessful in receiving funding then delays running into a period of years would occur or the scheme might not be delivered at all.  This means that any statutory orders obtained in expectation of funding are likely to expire and, therefore, additional costs will be incurred in obtaining them again.  Substantial abortive costs are incurred in scheme preparation if the bid is unsuccessful.   5.4              This has placed much more emphasis in recent years funding larger or major transport schemes through other sources and Government funding pots.  However, many funding streams have often been announced at short-notice and the funding has usually had time limitations meaning that a scheme has to be at a very advanced stage of preparation to be deliverable within such a time period.  5.5              The announcement of a much increased level of funding allocated for local major transport schemes over an extended period of years earlier this year was therefore very welcome.  However, the formulaic allocation meant that it was in many cases insufficient to deliver larger schemes.  As outlined in our response to other questions, the allocation of this funding via a competitive process with LEPs and with only short-term confirmed funding (beyond the initial allocation to LTB areas) creates considerable complications and means that there will not be the degree of funding certainty necessary to ensure effective preparatory investment in major schemes. Consideration should be given to the establishment of a funding stream to allow local highway and transport authorities to undertake the preparatory works for major schemes in order to get them to a state of readiness for when funding is eventually forthcoming. 5.6              LTP has been very successful in delivering smaller scale schemes, particularly safety schemes and schemes promoting sustainable transport.&#xa0; This is a mature process which local authority structures have adapted to.&#xa0; Recent reduction in LTP funding has in many ways been offset by the introduction of LSTF.&#xa0; LSTF programs have comprised specific packages of LTP schemes designed to meet LSTF criteria.&#xa0; The delivery timing of LPPF schemes and the requirement to deliver immediate impact on growth has limited the potential to access this funding stream, particularly for smaller and more rural authorities.6.1              As far as we understand the process, Local Transport Bodies no longer have a defined role in the process given that funding is being devolved to Local Enterprise Partnerships. At present, it is not evident as to how LEPs will be required to involve LTBs.  Although we suspect that most will do so, the lack of clarity has caused confusion, especially given the extensive work that local authorities and LEPs went through to deliver the government’s proposals for LTBs. 6.2              While there was no overlap between Local Transport Bodies, there are examples of overlapping LEPs whereby in these areas two different LEPs could be bidding for the same transport investment.  Not only does this create significant duplication in the bidding process, but there will be a need to resolve between the two LEPs how allocated funding will be determined in those areas of overlap.  This is likely to further delay the delivery of schemes.6.3              There is also much concern within the profession that the inclusion of a significant element of Integrated Transport (IT) Block funding within the Single Local Growth Fund is likely to inhibit the delivery of the small-scale schemes which the IT Block is used to deliver. Such schemes often demonstrate very high value for money, which could now be reduced as a result of extra costs associated with the more convoluted bidding process and bureaucracy for the Local Growth Fund. Moreover, the inclusion of top-sliced budgets that would have traditionally been used for Highway and Transport schemes into a fund that is un-ringfenced means that the level of uncertainty for local highway authorities is likely to be increased.6.4              The key benefit is certainty of funding which will significantly reduce the amount spent on scheme development: money that can be redirected to scheme delivery.&#xa0; Providing funding to all LTBs on a formula basis will inevitably reduce the proportion of available funding that can be awarded to any single individual LTB and this will impact on the potential to deliver larger schemes. Our concern is that removal of the ring-fence around transport spending will reduce overall transport spending, retarding development of the transport network.6.5              In addition, as highlighted in our earlier answers to questions 1 and 5, we understand that beyond the allocations made to each LTB area, the only funding which will be confirmed in July 2014 is for 2015/16, which will mean that authorities will not have the funding certainty required to deliver major schemes which span financial years.7.1   Very often the main barrier to private sector investment in essentially publicly owned         infrastructure and new and innovative funding mechanism is EU procurement rules coupled with the risk appetite and confidence of all parties, particularly in these austere times. Linked to this is the need to establish revenue streams that provide appropriate payback to the investors in a reasonable period of time. Local authorities can be best placed to take the longer term view and provide some form of security which could encourage the private sector to share risk differently and make investments in infrastructure that they would not otherwise make. For example, Northamptonshire County Council has introduced a Revolving Infrastructure Fund based on the following general principles: This approach has allowed a £100m programme of projects to commence as a result of upfront funding in the order of only £10m. 8.1              The current lines of accountability for decision making are very clear.  Local authorities are responsible for the promotion and delivery of schemes.  The Department for Transport is responsible for allocating funding in many instances and for processing certain statutory processes (Side Roads Order and Compulsory Orders).  Local authorities and the Ministers (through Parliament) are ultimately responsible to the electorate.8.2              In the past the local highway and transport authority would have had complete control over decision making  through due diligence and due process as a publicly accountable body responsible for the delivery and the maintenance of transport infrastructure. The system now being proposed is unnecessarily complicated and broadly as follows:There is considerable scope within this process for the priorities of Local Authorities, Local Transport Bodies and Local Enterprise Partnerships to be in conflict, and neither LTBs or LEPs are publicly accountable in this same way as local authorities. 8.3              We believe that this makes clear that the process for local decision making is much more complex than is currently the case, and we believe unnecessarily so. Under the current system where local decisions are made by elected members the lines of accountability are long-established and clear.&#xa0; Subsequent to the introduction of the Single Local Growth fund decision making will reside with LEPs.&#xa0; Lines of accountability have yet to be clarified.&#xa0; For example, what would be the outcome in the event that a LEP and local elected members could not reach agreement on priorities?&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;1&#xa0;
