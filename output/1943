defaultSPECIALIST ENGINEERING CONTRACTORS’ (SEC) GROUPdefaultThe Specialist Engineering Contractors’ (SEC) Group represents a sector comprising 60,000 firms employing over 300,000 people.  The sector accounts for the largest single component (by value) of construction output.  The SEC Group comprises the construction industry’s premier trade associations:  Plumbing and Heating Contractors’ Alliance, British Constructional Steelwork Association, Electrical Contractors’ Association, Building &amp; Engineering Services Association, Lift and Escalator Industry Association and SELECT (Electrical Contractors Association of Scotland).
default  Many of the firms in these trade associations provide construction services to local authorities either directly or indirectly as sub-contractors.

defaultISSUES defaultFdefaultORdefault THE COMMITTEEdefaultThe SEC Group represents a sector in the construction industry which, like most other sectors, is dominated by small businesses.  For the most part these businesses carry out the physical works of construction as sub-contractors in supply chains.  Many also work directly for local authorities under term contracts involving repair and maintenance of building services such as plumbing, lifts, electrical and mechanical installation.  As far as construction procurement by local authorities is concerned we invite the Committee to consider the following issues:

defaultNEED FOR A RADICAL CHANGE IN PROCUREMENT PRACTICESdefault&#xa0;
default3.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn spite of considerable progress made by many councils – especially city councils – to modernise construction procurement, most still procure in the way they did over 100 years ago.  Traditional procurement begins by engaging architects and engineers to carry out the design which is then put out to competitive tender to main contractors.  Tendering main contractors will, in turn, invite bids from sub-contractors who may also invite bids from sub-sub-contractors and suppliers.  Main contractors will, then, submit lump sum bids
default – generally based on the lowest price
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSub-contractors and suppliers will be specialist contractors such as foundations specialists, cladding and structural steelwork contractors, engineering services contractors and fit-out specialists.  Over 85% of the value of the industry’s output is delivered by such specialists together with their suppliers and manufacturers.  This includes a significant amount of design work as well as construction or installation works.  They are also responsible for the repair and maintenance of the delivered product.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.3     But, as the supply chain, they have little or no influence over the procurement process, especially the initial decisions affecting the planning of the project, the design, the management of the risks involved, and the costs.  It is these decisions which will determine whether the completed building or structure will represent value for money.  
defaultThis factor alone represents the major fault line in the procurement of construction works by local authorities
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.4     The traditional delivery process is fragmented and disjointed.  There is very little (if any) dialogue on design solutions between architects, consulting engineers and key specialist contractors such as engineering contractors, the latter often carrying out a substantial amount of design work.
default&#xa0;
default3.5     Specialist contractors and suppliers are frequently having to convert design concepts into practical and coordinated design solutions whilst at the same time absorbing most of the risks associated with the delivery process (including any shortcomings in the design they have inherited).  As a result out-turn costs are usually much higher than the initial lump sum bid.  
defaultConsequently the council taxpayer is paying for the waste that is inherent in traditional procurement.default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.6    There are other consequences of having a fragmented delivery process:
default&#xa0;
default(a)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default Planning and design decisions often overlook health and safety issues arising in the construction (or production) process.
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSustainable construction becomes impossible; there is much waste:

default&#xa0;
default(c)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAbove all else quality suffers.  This is largely due to:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.7.    Local authorities should seek to engage the supply chain earlier in the procurement process as part of an integrated team.  What is integration?  It is the bringing together of all the processes involved in construction delivery – especially 
defaultdesign
default and 
defaultconstruction
default – into a seamless whole.  This involves a flatter delivery structure with greater collaboration between the delivery team – consultants, project managers, specialist contractors, facilities managers and suppliers.  The focus should be on identifying the local authority’s requirements or 
defaultvalue criteria
default (relating to matters such as functionality and usage) and 
defaultthe appointment of the team best suited to deliver against such criteria.  Needless to say, the team should be appointed and actively involved at the outset of the procurement process to agree the design solutions, cost plan and risk allocation 
defaultbefore
default construction begins.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.8   As far back as 2005 the National Audit Office in its report 
defaultImproving Public Services through better construction
default concluded that the public sector was wasting £2.6bn a year as a result of not modernising procurement practices, including engaging key suppliers earlier in the procurement processes.  Central government has been addressing this issue through a change programme introduced under the Construction Strategy in May 2011.  Under that Strategy there are now projects being piloted that involve the whole supply chain from the outset in the planning and designing of the project.  The team is underwritten by Integrated Project Insurance (IPI) which provides comfort to the client that the project will be delivered in accordance with the cost plan which the client and team have agreed on.  IPI places the focus on successful project outcomes and avoids the possibility of all the parties involved hiding behind their own insurance policies in the event of disputes arising.  The first of these pilot projects has been taken up by the Defence Infrastructure Organisation.
default&#xa0;
default3.9    Within the local authority sector, the body responsible for promoting best practice is the 
defaultNational Improvement and Efficiency defaultPartnershipdefault (NIEP).  Whilst NIEP has been very active in encouraging local authorities to embrace best practice, it has limited resources.  Improving construction procurement in the local authority sector is a mammoth undertaking since, to be effective, it should involve monitoring procurement practices and challenging those that seek to retain outdated and wasteful procurement approaches. 
default&#xa0;defaultSUGGESTED RECOMMENDATIONSdefaultWe invite the Select Committee to recommend that the remit and resources of the National Improvement and Efficiency Partnership should be expanded so that it is able to take a more proactive role in both encouraging and challenging local authorities to modernise their construction procurement practices with a view to engaging the supply chain early in the planning and design stages.default&#xa0;default4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPRE-QUALIFICATIONdefault&#xa0;
default4.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA major criticism of local authority procurement practices by small firms relates to the different requirements of local authorities with regard to the pre-qualification of contracting firms.  The majority of local authorities maintain their own requirements relating to pre-qualification and have been very reluctant to standardise processes.  The result is that firms dealing with local authorities have to comply with differing pre-qualification requirements or undergo different vetting processes.  Understandably such duplication imposes a substantial burden on small firms.  Often local authorities will rely on third party commercial organisations to provide the necessary accreditation.
default&#xa0;
default4.2    Other than adding cost to suppliers, there is no evidence that the approach adopted by many local authorities as far as pre-qualification is concerned has added value to their operations.  Many third party assessments comprise a desk-based process that checks availability of certain policies and procedures relating to matters such as insurance and health and safety, and various references.  
defaultThe quality of the product or service is not audited or inspected.  defaultOn the other hand
default,
default the member trade association
defaults
default in SEC Group have introduced “quality mark” 
defaultassessment procedures
default.  They have made a substantial investment in developing schemes that are independently vetted and relate to firms’ technical proficiency and financial standing as well as health and safety performance.  Compliance with these requirements is regularly audited and monitored.
default&#xa0;
default4.3    Recent research carried out by SEC Group revealed that the major cost to firms in pre-qualifying relates to the bureaucracy generated in fulfilling requirements of the various local authorities.  Firms in membership of SEC Group’s trade associations spend over 60,000 days a year on filling in questionnaires.  The Welsh Government has estimated that the duplication involved in pre-qualifying in the Welsh public sector amounts to £20m a year.
default&#xa0;
default4.4    In an attempt to standardise the process the Business Department together with the British Standards Institute published a standard for prequalification known as PAS 91.  This is mandatory for central government construction clients and has to be applied to tier 1 suppliers 
defaultand
default their supply chains.  We believe that all local authorities should adopt it.
default&#xa0;
defaultSUGGESTED RECOMMENDATIONdefaultWe invite the Committee to recommend that all construction procurers in local authorities adopt PAS 91 as the standard for pre-qualification.  Local authorities should also require that their tier 1 suppliers apply it to their supply chains.  A target should be set so that all local authorities have adopted PAS91 by the end of 2014.  For those local authorities refusing to adopt it is suggested that the Department for Communities and Local Government intercede with the local authority concerned to encourage it to adopt it.default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSTANDARDISATIONdefault OF CONTRACTSdefault&#xa0;default5.1     In recent years central government have made significant strides towards using a standard suite of contract documentation across the 
defaultwhole of central government procurement.  The documentation used is the New Engineering Contract which is published by Thomas Telford.  Previously central government procurers tended to use different types of contracts, which was wasteful, as each contractor had to price different sets of contracts on each project with each having different risk/reward profiles.  The NEC contract has proved to be a resounding success because it promotes pro-active project management and requires parties to focus on the project outcomes.  This contract was used for the Olympic projects where it was instrumental in ensuring that these projects were delivered within time and budget.
default&#xa0;
default5.2     Some local authorities have already embraced the use of this contract but there is no reason in principle for the contract not to be used by every local authority.  The NEC is a suite of documentation including a range of options for all procurement routes and pricing options such as lump sum and target cost pricing.  The use by local authorities of a standard suite of contracts will, again, result in significant savings for both councils and industry.  
default&#xa0;
default5.3     Moreover there is a need for councils to insist on the use of standard contracts along the supply chain.  Lead contractors often use their own bespoke sub-contracts which are aimed solely at passing all risk to their SMEs in the supply chain.  The consequence of this is that disputes between the main contractor and sub-contractor add to the cost of delivery as well as impairing the health of local businesses in the supply chain.
default&#xa0;defaultSUGGESTED RECOMMENDATIONdefault&#xa0;defaultThe Committee is invited to recommend that:default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIMPROVING THE TREATMENT OF SMEs ENGAGED ON LOCAL defaultAUTHORITY WORKS CONTRACTSdefault&#xa0;default6.1     Firms engaged as sub-contractors in the supply chain on local authority projects often complain about the treatment they receive from the tier 1 supplier to the local authority.  All risks are passed down to the supply chain through the use of onerous contracts, and payment abuse is widespread.  Central government has acted to address this as far as procurement by government departments is concerned.  The current policy of government is to require that central government procurers establish project bank accounts on all projects unless there are compelling reasons not to do so.  Progress payments are made into a ring-fenced bank account and are then paid out of that account directly and simultaneously to all those involved in delivering the project.  This arrangement avoids the need for cash flow to be directed through a tier 1 supplier, then to a tier 2 supplier and then onwards to tier 3 suppliers further down the supply chain.
default&#xa0;
default6.2     Central government has a target of £4bn of government construction being paid through project bank accounts by the end of 2014.  Local authorities in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland are beginning to use project bank accounts following policy rulings by each of the devolved governments.  In England only a small number of local authorities such as Sheffield City Council and Manchester City Council have taken this up.
default&#xa0;
default6.3     On 16 March 2013 the Late Payment of Commercial Debts Regulations came into force.  These regulations, in effect, require public bodies to discharge payment within 30 days.  If payment is made late statutory interest is imposed on outstanding balances after this period.  We suggest that this is encouragement to local authorities to insist that their tier 1 suppliers pay their tier 2 suppliers of sub-contractors within 30 days.  The 30 day period should run from the due dates for 
defaultpayments in the contract between the local authority and the lead supplier. 
default&#xa0;
default6.4.    All local authorities should insist that, as a pre-qualifying requirement, all their suppliers should commit to paying their sub-contractors within 30 days of the due dates under their contracts with the local authority.  In the event of non-compliance there should be a “
defaultyellow card
default” and “
defaultred card
default” system.  A yellow card is a warning to the supplier or contractor to the local authority that it is in breach of the requirement to pay within 30 days.  If this is repeated the issuing of the red card will make the firm concerned ineligible for working with that local authority for a period of 2 years.  
default&#xa0;
default6.5     A recurring complaint from small firms relates to the practice of retentions.  This is particular to the construction industry.  Ostensibly monies are deducted – usually 5% of the contract value – as security in the event of defects in the work.  In practice retentions are primarily for improving the cash flow of the paying party.  The House of Commons Business Select Committee has on, at least two occasions, condemned the practice of retentions as outdated and as constituting bad practice.  A few years ago, SEC Group carried out a survey on local authorities to ascertain the use by local authorities of retention monies.  Some of the responses are set out in the box below.

defaultSOME LOCAL AUTHORITIES REGARD RETENTIONSdefaultAS CONVENIENT INTEREST-FREE LOANSdefault&#xa0;
default“Reduces borrowing and aids cash flow”

default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default     6.6.    Furthermore, retentions are never released until two or three years have elapsed following completion of the work.  This creates a major risk for firms in the supply chain.  Tier 1 suppliers to local authorities providing retentions do not run the risk of losing the monies in the hands of the local authority; public bodies do not go into insolvency.  But sub-contractors are at risk of losing their retention following tier 1 supplier insolvency.  To ensure equality of distribution of insolvency risk in regard to retentions, local authorities should insist that their suppliers - if deducting retentions – provide a bank guarantee to ensure that the retentions are paid when due for release.

default&#xa0;defaultSUGGESTED RECOMMENDATIONSdefault&#xa0;defaultIn summary we invite the Select Committee to make the following recommendations:default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default* defaultIn May 2013 Lord Young, the Prime Minister’s adviser on small business and enterprise, delivered a report to the Prime Minister entitled, 
defaultGrowing Micro Businessesdefault.  
defaultIn that report he recommended that payment terms
