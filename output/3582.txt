BRC19&#xa0;

[[[Written evidence submitted by Richard Brooks LCGI, MIET]]]I qualified as an electrician having studied in an FE college over 5 years attending evening classes as a mature student. This was supported by working in industry. I completed Electrical Installation qualifications to Level 4 and hold a Licentiateship in Electrical Installation from the City and Guilds. Entered Further Education 15 years ago to train new electricians and have contributed to several national organisations involved in the industry. This submission represents my own view.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;In summary – the current scheme allows the Part P certification scheme providers to apply less rigorous standards than those defined by the Sector Skills Council responsible for the industry. Having more the one scheme provider means that the level of standard required may be interpreted differently by these organisations with membership of some being far easier than others.  This can allow operatives who have not demonstrated sufficient competency or evidence of sufficient training to carry out electrical installation work. This can only lead to installations being installed that are inherently not safe.Even the suggestion of an umbrella list/register that all persons registered with the various scheme providers automatically belong to will not address the issues raised by the committee.               16 November 2013&#xa0;
