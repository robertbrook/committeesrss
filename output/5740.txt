[[[Surrey Sussex Collaboration - What we have achieved]]]&#xa0;Overview&#xa0;Surrey and Sussex Police forces have been working together bi-laterally to collaborate in a number of operational and support services since 2010.&#xa0;To date, a number of Joint Services have gone live including the Major Crime Team, Tactical Firearms Unit and Forensic Investigations (which were initially established under a ‘Joint Command’ Model) and Joint Procurement Service, Joint Insurance Service and Joint Transport Service under a ‘Lead Force’ Model.&#xa0;The ambition of collaborating in these areas was to deliver better policing services to the public through increasing resilience and inter-operability, improving performance, as well as delivering financial savings.&#xa0;The following sections include further details of what we did and an overview of some of the benefits realised.&#xa0;Joint Command&#xa0;In June 2011 the Joint Command was established.&#xa0;The original business case for the collaboration of Major Crime, Firearms and Scientific Support (now Forensic Investigations) under a Joint Command model, identified savings of £3.46m over 4 years and across both forces in the agreed ratio of 55:45 (Sussex : Surrey).These savings were not only achieved earlier than originally anticipated but also exceeded the target amount.&#xa0;Other benefits identified in the business case focused around improved performance, interoperability and resilience.&#xa0;Interoperability from an ICT perspective has been achieved with the implementation of the ‘Citrix Access Gateway’, allowing both Forces to log onto their respective networks along with a number of joint systems including SOCRATES - a Forensic database, Chronicle for recording Firearms Operations and HOLMES for recording of major crimes.&#xa0;Further benefits are cited in the business areas below:&#xa0;Tactical Firearms Unit&#xa0;The Tactical Firearms Unit (TFU) provides a 24/7 armed response capability across Sussex and Surrey. In addition to the Armed Response Vehicles for attending spontaneous incidents, the unit is integrated with the Firearms Training and Protection Unit to ensure that between them there is also capability for pre plannedoperations such as protection for royalty and VIPs.&#xa0;Since collaborating, a large amount of work has been completed in order for TFU to achieve a Joint Training Licence from the College of Policing including standardisation of equipment, aligned processes and a Joint IT system to record all operations. As a result, at the start of the financial year 2013/2014, TFU was awarded an interim Licence following Inspection. Verbal feedback was positive around standards of written submission and training. Furthermore, the College of Policing was so impressed with the high standard of design and management of the training that the Surrey-Sussex model is to be used as the national benchmark for the safe and effective delivery of firearms training. Work remains ongoing to meet the requirements to secure a full licence.&#xa0;Some of the benefits realised by collaboration on tactical firearms include:&#xa0;- Prior to collaboration it was not possible to have a Sussex and Surrey ARV working together and be confident that they would carry out a tactic in the same way. This led to significant risk if they were drawn together for a spontaneous incident. As they now train together it is possible to utilise the two nearest vehicles for an intervention irrespective of which force they originate from.&#xa0;- The blending of the two forces’ tactics has resulted in the TFU having the most effective and appropriate tactics ever used. Vehicle stops are now, in the opinion of officers involved in this arena for up to 15 years, more ‘fit for purpose’ than at any time previously in either force.&#xa0;- Joint training has been very successful for the sharing of ideas and building relationships outside of a single force. Officers from different forces now regularly train together.&#xa0;- There has been a reduction in the overall number of people that need specialist skills therefore reducing overall training requirements lowering training cost and reducing abstractions.&#xa0;Major Crime Team&#xa0;The collaboration of the Major Crime Teams in Surrey and Sussex saw amongst others changes, the move to a single shift pattern and a single version of HOLMES system with joint access for the recording of major crimes, the alignment of processes and the ability to flex resources across both force areas.&#xa0;As a result, the Major Crime Team (MCT) now operates as one across two Major Incident Rooms (MIRs) located in Woking and Brighton. Both teams work together in a borderless manner, leading and supporting investigations across both Force areas.&#xa0;The MCT is primarily responsible for investigating homicide within Surrey and Sussex. However, the remit of the team extends to cover other incidents as detailed below:&#xa0;- All Homicides- Stranger Rapes and Rape series- Death following Police contact (in support of the IPCC/Force Professional Standards Departments)- Corporate Manslaughter- Kidnap and crimes in action- Any other incident agreed by Chief Officers (e.g. high-profile, politically sensitive etc)- Child Death incidents&#xa0;The resilience of the team was tested throughout 2012-2013 with periods of outstanding demand. This is where collaboration and the ability to utilise resources across both forces has proved invaluable. It is testament that a review of the collaborative arrangements in December 2012 found implementation to have been successful with high service and confidence levels. As a result, MCT was signed off as a completed collaboration project in early 2013 and is now considered business as usual. &#xa0;Benefits:&#xa0;- It is established practice to deploy officers and staff at all levels from one area to the other in times of high demand. There are numerous examples of Operations in which the South Team assisted the North or vice versa. As mentioned above, there was a period of outstanding demand during a long running operation requiring significant resources. The ability to flex resources meant that MCT could continue to offer a professional and sustained service during this period and maintain the capacity to deal with day to day demand which would not have been possible prior to collaboration.- The increase in resilience means divisional detectives are now rarely required to bolster MCT allowing them to focus on divisional priorities.- The ability to provide support to a Basic Command Unit (division) when previously it would have to have been declined. For example Surrey based MCT staff have assisted West Sussex on an attempted murder case when Sussex MCT staff were fully committed and vice versa Sussex MCT staff have assisted Surrey Investigation strand on a rape investigation when Surrey MCT were fully committed.&#xa0;Forensic Investigations&#xa0;Forensic Investigation services across Surrey and Sussex underwent a complete restructure both in regards to staffing structures and how the service is provided.&#xa0;As part of the restructuring a number of new combined units were created including:&#xa0;- The Forensic Identification Services Unit (FISU) which went live in November 2012 based in Sussex. The unit has been at the forefront of developing cutting edge technology to digitally transmit fingerprint marks from SOCO bases and the Forensic Recovery Unit in real time, enabling identifications to be regularly achieved within hours. These 'faster' forensic results help support investigators in detecting crimes in a timelier manner, enabling them to arrest offenders before they can reoffend.&#xa0;- The Forensic Recovery Unit which went live in April 2013 following significant re-development of the existing laboratories based at Surrey Headquarters. It is here where staff carry out the scientific examination and screening of exhibits recovered from crime scenes; utilising chemical treatments, powders, DNA screening techniques, light sources and imaging to develop, enhance and capture fingerprints and other forensic trace evidence. The unit also attends crime scenes upon request to provide specialist advice and guidance to officers to assist the investigation in the use of forensic/chemical treatments to develop and enhance forensic evidence at the scene.&#xa0;- The Forensic Hub which went live in June 2013 also based at Surrey Headquarters. The Forensic Hub deals with all forensic submission advice, administration and reporting of results across Surrey and Sussex and sees a more efficient triage approach to requests for Forensic Investigation services.&#xa0;- Forensic Imaging Unit which went live as a collaborated unit in September 2013. The service which is delivered from Surrey Headquarters is responsible for handling photographic matters including but not limited to the production of photographic exhibits, print service, image enhancing, photo processing and uploading and downloading of images.&#xa0;Benefits&#xa0;- ISO 17025 Accreditation achieved - All police forces are required under an EU mandate to be accredited in forensic DNA screening and forensic enhancement processes and accommodation by November 2013 and April 2015 respectively. Failure to comply would have meant that no in-house activities could have be carried out resulting in increased and additional spend to external service suppliers. In support of the hard work and dedication shown by staff throughout the collaboration and change process, in July 2013 the team had a successful assessment by UKAS leading to accreditation being awarded in October 2013.&#xa0;- The service offered is now fit for purpose, meeting the ever changing needs of the two forces. An example of success can be seen in the following quote taken from an email which was received in relation to an armed robbery in Surrey in 2012, which was linked to a number of other offences and for which a usable mark was found on a demand note:&#xa0;‘Until we had the fingerprint ident this was going nowhere. The images had been circulated all over the place, locally, nationally you name it. We were going to get the CCTV shown on Crimewatch as a last resort but thanks to the fingerprint hit we didn’t need to do that. It was thanks to your good work and those of the investigating team that this man got a lengthy prison sentence (8.5 years) and 7 bank robberies have been cleared up’.&#xa0;Lead Force - Support Services&#xa0;In line with the implementation of business areas under a Joint Command, Surrey and Sussex also agreed some additional collaboration opportunities in Support Services as per below:&#xa0;Joint Insurance and Risk&#xa0;The Joint Insurance Service was the first collaboration between Surrey and Sussex that used a ‘Lead Force’ model. This service went live on 1st June 2012.&#xa0;Led by Sussex Police, the joint service has the responsibility for the insurance programmes of Surrey and Sussex and provides advice and guidance on all insurance-related matters.&#xa0;Joint Procurement Service&#xa0;The Joint Procurement Service, led by Surrey Police, went live on 1st September 2012 operating from a main site based in Guildford, with a satellite office based in Lewes, East Sussex.&#xa0;The service consists of two streams - future sourcing and tendering and contract management. Future sourcing concentrates on tendering high value, high risk contracts, ensuring that the best commercial and contractual terms are attained. Tendering and contract focuses on contract management, proactively delivering value throughout the term of all contracts held by the two forces. These contracts will include those established on a national, regional or force-specific basis.&#xa0;The main financial benefits of the project are not the savings associated with the re-organisation of the procurement function - they are the savings that will be realised from the proactive management of the forces´ contracts. The two forces annually spend around £100m on goods, works and services, and there is considerable potential for savings to be made from this expenditure through combining the requirements of both forces to benefit from economies of scale and also consolidating the number of suppliers used.&#xa0;A Joint Procurement Service also changed the way that procurement is undertaken across the forces. As a result they now use a consultative model, delivering a professional advisory service to the forces offering a number of benefits including earlier interaction and provision of commercial support and market knowledge rather than just a technical processing function that manages the paperwork.&#xa0;Joint Transport Service&#xa0;The Joint Transport service went live on 1st October 2013 led by Sussex Police and deals with the provision and support of Surrey and Sussex fleet. This includes all matters concerned with:&#xa0;- fleet costs- the evaluation, acquisition and disposal of vehicles- maintenance and repair- licensing and insurance- hire contracts- fuel management including bunkers and pumps- fleet statistics&#xa0;The benefits realised by collaborating in these areas are focused around improved efficiencies, effectiveness and delivery along with a reduction in pay and costs as a result of streamlining the services. Each unit offers a professional and consistent service which utilises best practice with expertise shared across the forces offering greater resilience and interoperability.&#xa0;Surrey and Sussex are currently building upon these existing collaborations as part of a vision to create a ‘unified organisation’. Whilst as indicated above a number of benefits have been realised, important lessons have also been learnt along the way which will help to shape and develop the future services.&#xa0;Surrey &amp; Sussex Police&#xa0;&#xa0;
