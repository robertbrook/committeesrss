"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Sustainable Food Trust (AMR0056)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nKey recommendations&#xa0;&#xa0;\n2.1 \nThe Sustainabl\ne Food Trust (SFT) \nwas\n established in 2011 to help accelerate the transition to more durable\n and\n benign\n food production\n. We welcome\n \nthis opportunity to comment on\n the issue of antimi\ncrobial resistance\n (AMR)\n and\n will concentrate on\n those aspects that \nrelate to\n the \ndevelopment of AMR\n \nin\n \nfood animals\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.2 \nThe author of this \nsubmission\n declares an interest as he \nis an organic \nbeef and sheep \nfarmer\n and \nhas\n been involved in the development of organic \nfarming \nstandards\n in the UK\n, which restrict the use of antibiotics on organic farms\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;3.1 It might be more helpful to consider how \nAMR\n has developed over the last 15 years, since\n, although the issue was briefly revisited by the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee in its third report in 2001\n \n[1]\n,\n this more closely equates to the period since \na \nParliament\nary committee\n last gave \nserious \nconsideration to \nAMR\n in 1998\n \n[2]\n \nand the ACMSF produced a repo\nrt \non this \nin 1999 \n[3]\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.2 \nAlthough AMR is an inevitable co\nnsequence of antimicrobial use \nthere has\n been an unprecedent\ned \nincrease in the \nnumber of\n \nfarming-related \nAMR developments.\n \nWe have seen\n:\n&#xa0;\n3.2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe emerg\nence of fluoroquinolone resistance in Campylobacter\n in poultry and pigs\n \n[4]\n,\n which is contributing to the rise of fl\nu\noroquinolone resistance in campylobacter infec\ntions in humans\n \n[5]\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nfluoroquinolone resistance in salmonella\n \n[6]\n[7]\n \nand the\n emergence of plasmids carrying\n fluoroqui\nnolone resistance in salmonella\n.\n \nP\nlasmids are mobile genes that \nreadily\n pass resistance fro\nm one bacterium to another\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \na significant ris\ne in AMR in E.\n \ncoli urinary\n-\ntract infections\n (UTIs)\n \nin humans \n[8]\n[9]\n.\n \nF\no\no\nd is recognized as an important source of AMR ge\nnes in the human gut\n,\n and the E.\n \ncoli causing UTIs are faecal in origin\n. \nIt has been estimated there are \nmore than\n 750,000 E. coli infections every year in the UK, most of which will be UTIs\n \n[10]\n. Treatment failures \nin the UK \ndue to the rise in AMR in UTIs have\n contributed to \na\n \n4-fold increase in E. coli\n \nblood poisoning\n \nover the last 20 years\n,\n to approx\nim\nately 40,000 cases annually\n \nand an increase i\nn mortality to approximately 8,0\n00 deaths \neach year\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.2.4\n              \nthe emergence of ESBL (extended spectrum beta lactamase) resistan\nt E. coli \nI\nn UK farm animals\n and imported chicken\n \n[10]\n,\n \nand \nits spread to salmonella and klebsiella.\n&#xa0;\n3.2.6\n              \nthe emergence of \nlivestock-associated \n(LA) \nstrains of MRSA \nwhich \nhave the \nability to colonize, pass between \nand cause infection in farm anim\nals and humans\n \n[11]\n. In the UK\n,\n \nMRSA \nST398 has been \nfound \nin milk\n \non \ndairy farms\n and in horses \n[12]\n[13]\n. It has also been found in a small number of human cases \n[14]\n. \n&#xa0;\n3.2.7\n              \nthe discovery of\n an entirely new type of MRSA in dairy cows and humans\n,\n \nwith a \nm\necC \nresistance \ngene\n,\n as opposed to a \nm\necA gene\n \n[15]\n[16]\n. It \nhas been \nestimated \nthis\n could\n be responsible for 1\n-4\n% of \nDanish human MRSA cases. I\nt also causes human infections in England and Scotland\n \n[15]\n[17]\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.2.8\n              \nthe \nemergence of \ncarbapenem\n-\nresistant \ninfections\n in humans, and \nisolated \nreports \nof \ncarbapenem-resistan\nt \nbacteria in farm animals \n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n. This has \npossibly spread from humans to farm animals\n,\n \nbut the use of farm antibiotics \ncan \n‘co-select’ for carbapenem\n-\nres\nistant bacteria once present\n \n[21]\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.2.9\n              \nthe emergence of \nthe\n new epidemic multi-drug resistant \n(monophasic)  \nsalmonella typhimurium \nin pigs and other farm animals\n, \nwhich is \ncausing\n infections in humans \n[22]\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.2.10\n              \nthe emergence of linezolid resistance in staphylococci and enterococci in \nboth humans and animals and the emergence of plasmid-\nmediated\n linezolid resistance\n \n[23]\n. Linezolid is an antibiotic of last resort for treating infections such as MRSA and VRE. \nIt \nis not used in agriculture, but the veterinary antibiotic florfencol is cross-resistant\n with linezolid\n \n[24]\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.2.11\n              \nAMR is also steadily becoming a problem for the effective treatment of farm \nanimals. \nR\nesistance to tetracyclines, sulphonomides\n and ampicillin \nhas\n been \nincreasing for many years \nin E. coli\n,\n \nand the \nrise\n \nand spread \nof ESBL E.\n \ncoli \non\n \nBritish \nfarms \ncould make \ninfections\n difficult \nto treat \nin future. \nAMR\n has also been increasing in swine dysentery\n,\n \nwith some cases resistant to all ve\nterinary antimicrobials including\n \nthe pleuromuti\nlin\ns\n \n[25]\n a class of antibiotics being developed for human medicine with the potential for treating MRSA and tuberc\nulosis\n \n[26]\n. \nThe pleuromutalin\n,\n tiamulin\n,\n can \nbe added to the feed of egg-\nlaying hens and has a zero withdrawal period. \nIt is not clear what part \nAMR\n played in a m\najor outbreak in East Anglia which affected 24 farms \nbetween 2006 and 2009\n,\n but 3,000 sows had to be slaughtered\n,\n because they could not be treated effectively\n \n[27]\n.\n V\neterinary antimicrobials that are used to treat swine dysentery are also permitted for its control\n (or in some cases prevention)\n at sub-therapeutic levels over prolonged periods. This is li\nkely to have contributed to the rise of resistance.\n&#xa0;\n3.2.12\n              \nThe House of Lords drew attention to the high use of fluoroquinolones on \nfarms and recommended action\n in 1998\n. This fell\n shortly afterwards\n as a result\n,\n but has increased annually since and now st\nands at its highest ever level\n, 2,434 kg of active ingredient\n. The use of modern (3\nrd\n and 4\nth\n generation) cephalosporins and macrolides on farms also continues to increase. These are defined as critically important antimicrobials \n(CIAs) \nin human medicine\n \n[28]\n. Additional restrictions \non their use are needed.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n4.1\n \nOnly one published study has ever \nlooked at the direct effect of food on the levels of \nresistance in bacteria in the human intestine\n \n[29]\n. It found that resistance levels fell very sharply \nwhen\n food was sterilised, providing strong evidence that food contributes \nsignificantly \nto resistance\n in some human infections\n. Because this\n was only a small study, a larger study should be undertaken to see if the results are replicated. \n&#xa0;\n4.4 \nR\nesearch \nis needed \nto establish \nfor the full range of antimicrobials,\n \nhow long after \ntreatment AMR falls back to background levels\n. This \ncould be used \nto \namend statutory \nwithdrawal \nperiods\n \nto help protect consumers against antimicrobial resistance as well as residu\ne\ns\n.\n \nA\n Defra-funded project \nfrom 2001-2004 concluded, ‘\nThe finding of this study indicate that the risk posed by the antibiotics \neva\nluated coul\nd be greatly reduced\n by increasing the withdrawal period by 7 days for chlortetracycline and enrofloxacin, and introducing a withdrawal period of 3 weeks for tylosin and 2 weeks for avilamycin.\n’\n \n[30]\n \nFollow up research at a cost of £410,000 was carried out which identified additional strategies for reducing AMR in animals at slaughter\n \n[31]\n, but this \nall \nappears to have been shelved and \nTylosin, for example\n,\n still has a\n zero withdrawal period in pigs\n. \n&#xa0;\n4.5 \nT\nhere is an\n \nurgent \nneed to establish\n:\n&#xa0;\n5. \nIs there sufficient research and investment into new antibiotics?&#xa0;\n5.1 \nR\nesearch should be encouraged, with public funds if necessary\n,\n into the development of new antimicrobial classes, especially t\nh\nose with Gram-negative action. \n&#xa0;\n6.\n \nWhat measures (including behavioural change) have been most effective in controlling the spread of resistant pathogens and what measures could be used to control other pathogens?&#xa0;\n6.1 \nAs explained above\n,\n \nlonger\n withdrawal periods between treatment and slaughter can dramatically reduce levels of AMR.\n This may be more practical for \ncattle, \npigs and free-range poultry than broilers. \nReducing stocking density, allowing young animals to develop good immune systems (for example by \nlater \nweaning\n)\n \nand reducing stress are all very helpful\n in reducing the use \nof antimicrobials and the levels of resistance in pathogens and commensal bacteria\n. Defra-funded \nstudies have shown that there are ver\ny much lower levels of AMR in organically\n \nreared animals\n \n[32]\n.\n Caution is needed \nwith\n the use of some disinfectants as these also select for AMR.\n&#xa0;\n7.\n \nWhat are the strengths and weaknesses of the Government’s 2013-2018 Strategy?&#xa0;\n7.1 \nThe SFT welcomes the three\n strategic aims, the overall spirit and,\n with some qualifications, the seven\n key areas for future action in the strategy. However, we \nalso \nsee\n a number of serious weaknesses\n. \n&#xa0;7\n.2\n \nThe strategy should have recognised the need for vets to be \nrequired\n to adopt antibiotic-prescribing policies, just as the Health Act 2006 introduced such a require\nment for hospital prescribing. \nVets have the right to ‘prescribe a\nccording to their clinical judg\nment’ but all\n v\neterinary and medical prescribing should be subj\nect to intelligent overview by colleagues and regulators and those prescribing poorly should receive additional training.\n7\n.3\n \nWe welcome the commitment to encourage the training of farmers. However, it is important \nthis\n is balanced and independent. Since t\nhe ban on advertising antimicrobials \nin farming journals\n came into force in October 2013, some phar\nmaceutical companies have been holding \nseminars for farmers to improve their understanding \nof \nrespons\nible antimicrobial use. That is not a substitute for \ntraining\n,\n as they will inevitably use \nthese as commercial opportunities\n to promote their products\n.\n \n&#xa0;7\n.4\n \nWe welcome the commitments on surveillance for AMR\n,\n but it is \nalso \nessential that data be \ncollected on\n how much of \neach \nantimicrobial class is used \nin \neach\n species\n.\n&#xa0;Broader concerns about the strategy\n&#xa0;7.5\n \nWe welcome the commitment to advocate minimizing routine preventative antimicrobial use but this does not go far enough. \nThis\n practice \nstill \nis still widespread\n and the \nunderlying\n cause of \nmost\n resist\nance problem on farms\n. It is\n primarily undertaken for commercial not clinical reasons. \nThere would be less need for CIAs if other antimicrobials were not abused in this way. \nIn addition, a\nlthough growth promotion has been banned, \nsome\n \nantibiotics can still\n be\n used at growth-promoting levels as a low cost insurance against the risk of possible disease.\n \nIn addition, almost all dairy cows are routinely treated with antibiotics in attempts to prevent mastitis.\n&#xa0;7.6\n \nThe inclusion of antibiotics in the feed or wa\nter of herds or flocks of animals accounts for over 85% of farm antibiotic use in the UK \n[33]\n, in contrast to Sweden where \nit\n account\ns\n for 12\n%\n \n[34]\n. Many of these antibiotic products are licensed for preventative treatment, and in some cases there is no requirement that any disease be diagnosed. \n&#xa0;7.7\n \nIn t\nhe past year, both the Government and the VMD have stated that they do not approve of the routine use of antibiotics for disease prevention\n \n[35]\n[36]\n, and in \n2011 the European Medicines Agency issued a statement which discourages routine use \n[37]\n. Very recently, a new scientific commission launched by \nthe journal \nLancet Infectious Diseases recommended that routine preventative use in farming of medically important antibiotics be phased out\n \n[21]\n.\n&#xa0;7.8\n \nDespite these concerns\n,\n numerous veterinary antibiotic products may still be used routine\nly.\n A timetable to phase out this practice in the UK\n should be included in the strategy\n.\n This would not \nprevent \nthe metaphylactic (\npreventative\n)\n use of antimicrobials when disease has been identified in \nsome animals in \na herd or flock.\n&#xa0;7.9\n \nThe implementation of the strategy is to be led by\n a new ‘\nInterdepartmental High-level Steering Group’. We see no \ndifference \nbetween this and the interdepartmental steering group that has presided over a period of spectacular increases in AMR\n developments in farm animals.\n As such \nindependent\n oversight with teeth is \nneeded\n.\n&#xa0;\n7.10 The need for an over-arching independent scientifi\nc committee to embrace both human and veterinary medicine were key recommendations of the Swann Committee report in 1969 and the House of Lords’ report in 1998. In both cases the Governments of the day took several years to set up the committees, overloade\nd them with \nrelatively minor\n tasks, failed to provide them with adequate resources\n to consider the bigger picture\n, then when there was little media interest in AMR, quietly wound \nthem \nup. \n&#xa0;7.11\n \nT\nhe need for such a committee is even greater today\n and we re\nco\nmmend that one should be set up. To\n avoid history repeating itself \nthere also needs to be a \nnew \npermanent\n Parliamentary committee \nto monitor\n \nAMR issue and \nthe Government’s progress in addressing it\n. \nThe process initiated by the House of Lords committee \ni\nn 1998 \ncame to an end in 2001, just at the point when continuing scrutiny \ncould have prevented some of the most serious AMR developments\n.\n&#xa0;\n7.12\n \nA major concern about the strategy is the role given to the VMD in jointly providing \nthe \nlead on implementation \nwith PHE. Although the strategy states ‘The Department of Health, with support from PHE \nand Defra [our emphasis],\n will lead on implementation of the Strategy’, this is misleading since responsibility for AMR was taken from Defra in April 2011 and handed to\n the VMD.\n It is therefore the VMD, \nnot\n Defra, that will be \nlead\ning\n on the veterinary side\n. It \nwas the VMD, not Defra, that was involved in drawing up the Strategy (see p3 of Strategy).\n Motives for this obfuscation should be considered.\n&#xa0;\n7.13 \nAlthough the \nVMD is efficient\n and very professional,\n and has addressed a number of longstanding abuses of veterinary medicines over the past year, it\n is not suited to this \nprimary\n \nleadership role \non the veterinary side \ndue to its \nlack of democratic accountability and i\nnherent conflict\n of interest\ns\n in \nthe way in which it was established\n,\n in 1989\n,\n as a self-funding agency, as part of moves to ‘roll back the state’ and remove regulatory burdens on industry.\n \nAs \nexplained below, \nthis \nmake\ns\n it excessively vulnerable to influe\nnce and lobbying, particularly \nby\n the pharmaceutical industry.\n Similar concerns have been expressed in relation to the regulation of human medicines\n \n[38]\n, however \nneither the Department of Health nor \nPHE\n, which lead the implementation of the AMR strategy on the medical side\n,\n have no\n financial conflict of interests\n,\n since\n their funding comes from central Government\n.\n&#xa0;\n7.14 In 2011-12, 79% of the VMD’s \n£14.3 million \nin\ncome came from the industries it regulates, with two thirds of this coming from pharmaceutical companies\n,\n mostly for \nlicensing work\n \n[39]\n. \nHowever, under the EU’s Mutual Recognition and Decentralised procedures, the VMD must compete with other EU national licensing bodies to attract applications, \nbecause\n the pharmaceutical comp\nanies \ncan choose which\n \nEU \nlicensing body to work with\n \n[40]\n.\n&#xa0;\n7.15\n This competitive licensing situation ensures that the VMD must appear attractive to pharmaceutical\n companies and creates a conflict of interest. The VMD clearly recognises that its finances depend on companies viewing it favourably and says in its latest Business Plan that one of its priorities is to \n‘Ensure that the veterinary pharmaceutical industry \nconsider the level of service\n&#xa0;\nprovided by the VMD to be good or e\nxcellent’. And it explains why this is important by saying \n‘To enable an increased percentage of EU work to\n&#xa0;\ncome via the VMD we need to measure and understand the views of our\n&#xa0;\ncustomers so we\n can understand any barriers to being the agency of choice’\n \n[41]\n.\n&#xa0;\n7.16\n \nA\n further area of concern is that\n the VMD states, \n‘In 2013/14 we will be\n&#xa0;\nworking with other suitable organisations and assurance schemes that we have\n&#xa0;\nidentified, to consider delegating the responsibility for inspections to them\n’\n \n[41]\n.\n This raises the question\n of whether it is appropriate \nfor a largely\n industry-funded regulator\n to\n delegate regulation \nto a wholly-\nindustry\n body\n,\n over the use of products \nwhere\n profit is such \na strong motivating factor? \n&#xa0;\n7.17\n \nThe VMD \nalso \nstates it, ‘We will continue to consult our customers and interest groups at the\n&#xa0;\nearliest stage during development of policy and strategy and invite them to put\n&#xa0;\nforward proposals for the development of effect\nive regulatory mechanisms\n.’ We question whether it is appropriate for the VMD to be \nthe arbiter\n on policy \nand strategy\n in relation to AMR\n,\n given it\ns\n vulnerability to industry influence?\n&#xa0;\n7.18\n \nThe VMD states it ‘\nwill be actively involved in the\n&#xa0;\ndiscussion required to promote the use of veterinary medicines in preventing\n&#xa0;\ndisease in order to maximise productivity’ \n[41]\n[p6]\n.\n \nAnd, ‘In \nall\n&#xa0;\ncases the VMD will work to influence the legislation to ensure that\n&#xa0;\nsafe and effective veterinary medicines remain available for use in\n&#xa0;\nanimals and regulatory burdens are kept to the minimum\n' [41]\n [p4]\n.\n \nThis suggests the VMD has one message for the indu\nstry which wants to \nretain preventative use and market\ns\n antimicrobials\n to maximise farm productivity\n,\n and another for a more general audi\nence \n[36]\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n7.19\n \nThe VMD had a large number of meetings last year with industry representatives. Fifty of these related to licensing issues, an unspecified number related to policy issues. One of the VMD’s roles, for which Defra pays it £3 million pa, is ‘the provision and\n implementation of policy advice to Ministers’. Since Defra no longer has any responsibility for AMR and even its own advisory committee on AMR is chaired and administered by the VMD, Ministers have \nlittle\n alternative but to \nagree to\n the advice the VMD giv\nes them. \nThis\n means that \nindustry \nlobbying \nof the \nVMD is \nessentially equivalent to\n lobbying a Minister. This is inappropriate\n,\n \nespecially at the present time when the industry \nis fighting to oppose\n moves to end routine prophylactic use of antimicrobials\n \n[42]\n.\n&#xa0;\n7.20\n \nThe VMD is also responsible for the Government’s assessment of the significance of veterinary antimicrobial use \nto AMR\n in infections affecting humans. \nIn \nthe 5-year Strategy\n,\n this\n begins with the statement, ‘\nIncreasing scientific evidence suggests that the clinical issues with antimicrobial resistance that we face in human medicine are primarily the result of antibiotic use in people, rather than the use of\n antibiotics in animals.\n’ The VMD has produced several similar statements before. The statement may be correct overall but it is \nhighly \nmisleading and creates the impression there is no significant farm dimension\n to the AMR problem\n, when closer examination\n \nof following text and the science \nshows there \nclearly \nis. In response \nFarmers Guardian told its readers, \n‘\nAntimicrobial resistance seen in human medicine is primarily the result of antibiotic use in people, rather than animals, a major Government report h\nas stated’\n \n[43]\n. There are many similar examples\n.\n The VMD’s approach \nis at odds with concerns expressed in many countries and \ndesigned to please \nits main sources of funding. More seriously\n,\n the phrasing of such statements \nre-enforces entrenched views and \nseriously\n undermine\ns\n efforts to \nreduce AMR in farm animals through more judicious use of antimicrobials\n.\n&#xa0;November 2013\n[1]\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHouse of Lords Science and Technology Committee 2001.
