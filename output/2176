defaultWritten evidence from defaultFlyingbinarydefault [OD18]default&#xa0;default1. Why is open data important? default&#xa0;
defaultOpen Data supports the development of digital businesses such as my own. Open Data’s real value is as a means of creating context for the work that we do as a business. We are a web science company who specialise in 
defaultempowering businesses, governments and citizens to drive the value for data, open data is a vital component of this work and has been since we started the company four years ago. We have evidenced key issues across the world to create change invariably inc
defaultorporating Open Data. This work has been showcased in the Guardian and has engaged audiences across the world, the largest audience for a single project was 34 million people.
default&#xa0;
default2. Why does the Government need an open data strategy? default&#xa0;
defaultOur digital future as 
defaulta company is 
defaultdependant
default on our ability to source data from many places and deliver insight, but more importantly predict likely patterns or outcomes. We are a UK company and although we work globally we strive to deliver at least 50% of the value of data we
default process, analyse and publish for the benefit of UK economy.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Government Digital Service has a similar ambition to 
defaultFlyingBinary
default, to deliver  a service for our clients that is “Digital by Default”. The roadmap we create at 
defaultFlyingBinary
default for this work is 
defaultdependant
default on data. The context of this work is set by the meta data available as Open Data. Incredibly even after many years of huge efforts by Cabinet Office some of this data is still under lock and key. Which makes the work that we could do and the inno
defaultvation we can bring limited by the Open Data available. It is this tragedy which prompted me to work as a member of the Open Data User Group last year and to continue with this ODUG work for a second year as there is still so much to do. As an SME this is 
defaultreal overhead for my company to do this work without any form of payment, however it is important that data entrepreneurs like myself are able to input real world experience into this process. 
default&#xa0;
default3. What should the Government’s aims be for the release of odefaultpen data? defaulta. Are the Government’s stated key outcomes in its Open Data Strategy the defaultright ones? default&#xa0;
defaultThe Open Data Strategy and the Shakespeare review and response are vital to move the Open Data agenda forward. However the delivery of this agenda is still 
defaultdependent on Cabinet Office being adequately supported by both the Department for Business Innovation and Skills and HM Treasury. Fundamentally the collaboration and willingness 
defaultof these key players to move to new business approaches and models will determ
defaultine the success of the Open Data agenda. 
default&#xa0;
default4. 
defaultHow can those engaged in open data, and those engaged in producing defaultgovernment statistics work together effectively to produce new data? default&#xa0;
defaultMaking data available to web users be they citizens or communities in 
defaultan interactive evidenced way is a skill set some data entrepreneurs have and government does not. We have as part of our outreach work run free workshops for over 170 advanced analysts within government to explain data innovations which make the most diffe
defaultrence in this arena. We believe that data is a language which traditionally trained staff find difficult to communicate and need retraining to do well. This will require a collaborative approach between government and data entrepreneurs and as yet has no m
defaulteans of being delivered.
default&#xa0;
default5. How can more statistics and administrative data of all kinds become more freely defaultavailable? default&#xa0;
defaultThis will depend on the success of the NII approach and the ability of data.gov.uk to facilitate this data. It is hoped that 
defaultDepartments will back this initiative by 
defaultcurating
default their entries on the platform to allow all data to be declared. It will then depend on the ability of the platform to facilitate and engagement and evidencing model to ensure that data can be prioritised an
defaultd scheduled for release. ODUG paved the way for this innovative approach which it is hoped can be continued for NII. 
default&#xa0;
default6. Is open data presented well and of adequate quality? default&#xa0;defaulta. Are the formats of the data being published accessible, useable and defaultundersdefaulttandable to the public? default&#xa0;
defaultI can best evidence this by referencing an example. As part of my work on ODUG in collaboration with the data.gov.uk team we developed a new Open Data model, demand led Open Data. This was built into the data.gov.uk platform and e
defaultvidenced the Open Data requirements of the data community. We have had over 5,000 interactions with the new functionality. Over 550 requests in 9 months which evidenced the barriers to Open Data and supports Sir Tim 
defaultBerners
default Lee’s call for raw data. The Ope
defaultn Data barriers evidenced in the main are cost, licensing and unreliability of releases. Raw, incomplete and unclean data is not see as a barrier to Open Data by the community.
default&#xa0;
defaultHere is a link to the 
defaultODUG
default 
defaultRoadmap
default which evidences Demand Led Open Data.  I have also produced evidenced roadmaps for the departmental supply side but these have not been taken up by and pub
defaultlished by Cabinet Office. The new publish by default mechanism appears to be the favoured route for this capability. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs a member of ODUG I will be asking for NII to be evidenced in the same way. We as a company can do this work however we will not be und
defaultertaking this without payment as we did for the ODUG facilities, which may result in this evidencing not being done. 
default&#xa0;
defaultb. What metadata is needed to make releases useful? default&#xa0;
defaultMeta data is the key to releasing Open Data a minimum set of meta data is better th
defaultan none at all. This is an area of government Open Data which is very poorly done, however data companies like ourselves can start innovations with minimal meta data.
default&#xa0;
defaultc. Who will use the data released? default&#xa0;
defaultOne particular example is from a Tech City company 
defaultI mentor who have requested DEFRA data via ODUG to enable them to challenge the CAP levy paid by the UK which is due to be renegotiated in 2014. The resultant analysis they produce could be of huge benefit to UK PLC. This data has not yet been released by 
defaultDEFRA although ODUG are attempting to get this data released as soon as possible.  
default&#xa0;
defaultAs G-Cloud suppliers we have built mapping products which would enable us to track the transition / reorganisation of government departments, for example the old and the n
defaultew NHS organisation. Due the price of the PAF and the restrictions on the use of OS data it is a prohibitive cost for us to extend the capabilities of our current mapping products. If this the case for our company this is the case for any other. Additional
defaultly a free PAF for micros SMEs is no help. It can take months to bring a product like this to market and there is no guarantee on future prices of PAF data once Royal Mail is in private sector hands. Therefore this is not an offer worth the risk. Additional
defaultly it appears that SME data companies who have raised funds to buy PAF will not benefit from this offer. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFor more information it should be noted that every request for a data set evidenced by ODUG gives detailed information from the requester on the use 
defaultthey will make from the data. The examples submitted are many and varied from a large number of requesters the majority private individuals, SMEs and 
defaultStartups
default.
default&#xa0;default7. How successful has the Government’s Open Data initiative been in changing defaultbehaviour in the defaultCivil Service and wider public sector?default 
default&#xa0;
defaultDespite all the great work which has been done by Cabinet Office there is still a genuine reluctance to embrace the Open Data agenda. My company supplies cloud and data services on all 4 G-Cloud lots and has been aw
defaultarded all 3 G-Cloud frameworks. We find as part of our G-Cloud work data literacy is very low across the Civil Service. In contrast the ODUG Roadmap which visualises the evidence for demand led Open Data has been very well received and is even being used b
defaulty in Government Departments to inform them on the priorities for their Open Data strategies. Without more tools like the ODUG Roadmap it will prove difficult to educate and inform the Civil Service at large and create a culture change which affects behavio
defaultur in general.  
default&#xa0;
default8. Which datasets are the most important?default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis is my 3 year as a mentor to our companies in Tech City where I specialise in advising on growth, particularly for those companies electing to “bootstrap” growth rather than seek investment
default. Despite the great work of ODUG in the first year we have been unable to unlock key datasets such as the Postal Address File owned by Royal Mail and data held by the Ordnance Survey. These data sets are key for ourselves and our Digital data companies to 
defaultdevelop innovations and products for the benefit of UK Plc. 
default&#xa0;
defaulta. What are the best examples of data being made open and resultant defaultbenefits to business or society? default&#xa0;
defaultThe Price Paid dataset released by the Land Registry was a priority request from the deman
defaultd led ODUG Open Data innovation facilities on data.gov.uk. This Open Data is being worked on by a number of companies and I expect this to generate a number of innovations by companies large and small in the housing market.
default&#xa0;
default9. How effective is the work bdefaulteing undertaken by the Cabinet Office to monitor the defaultprogress of Departments in publishing their agreed datasets? default&#xa0;
defaultI have also  produced evidenced roadmaps for the Departmental supply side but these have not been taken up by and published by Cabinet Offi
defaultce. The new publish by default mechanism appears to be the favoured route for this capability. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs a member of ODUG I will be asking for NII to be evidenced in the same way. We as a company can do this work however we will not be undertaking this without 
defaultpayment as we did for the ODUG facilities, which may result in this evidencing not being done.
