"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the Pemphigus Vulgaris Network (LTC 15)&#xa0;The Committee is exploring the scope for more people with long-term conditions to be treated in the community and outside hospital.\n \nWe quite understand the move to\nwards\n treating more people in the community but think it is entirely inappropriate and potentially dangerous for those of us with rare and life-threatening dermatology conditions.\n&#xa0;\nThe \nPemphigus\n \nVulgaris\n Network wants to stress that \ntreating us in the community and outside hospital\n is not what people with \npemphigus\n \nvulgaris\n \nneed\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nGiven that \npemphigus\n is a \nvolatile\n and life-threatening \ndermatology \ncondition\n,\n we need our medical care to continue being treated in a hospital setting (\nie\n following B\nritish \nA\nssociation of \nD\nermatology\n guidelines).\n \n&#xa0;\nFew GPs have ever had a \npemphigus\n patient \n(it is an orphan disease) \nand whilst we need our GPs to be looking after our general health, especially given the possible side effects of necessary \nimmuno-suppressives\n, the treatment for our condition needs to be determined by consultant dermatologists\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nIndeed\n,\n if the \npemphigus\n is not responding to standard drug regimens\n,\n this care may need (at various points) to be with consultant dermatologists \nwho \nspeciali\ns\ne\n in, and \nhave a particular interest in\n,\n \nblistering diseases â€“ as is being currently defined by the work of the \nNHS \nSpecialised\n Commissioning Board.\n&#xa0;\nTo sum up: treatment in the community, outside a hospital setting, could put the lives of \npemphigus\n \nvulgaris\n patients at risk.\n&#xa0;\nMay 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
