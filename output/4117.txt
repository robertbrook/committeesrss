[[[General Comments: ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The latest release (AR5) of climate change assessment by the UN Climate Change Body IPCC has once again stirred the ‘global warming-human-CO2-extreme weather’ debate and the climate science community at large appears to be sharply divided about the role of atmospheric CO2 on the earth’s climate and possible future adverse impact of changing climate on world humanity. Many articles, since the release of the IPCC SPM (Summary for Policymakers), have appeared in various media, supporting the IPCC view of the climate that “earth’s climate is warming and there is an urgent need to curb human-CO2 emission!” Several prominent climate scientists and skeptics of the IPCC science have expressed disappointment over IPCC latest release lamenting the fact that “IPCC has NOT provided adequate explanation re: the pause in warming of the climate for past 16 years (and continuing!)”. In a scathing article, Ms Judith Curry (a respected atmospheric scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology Atlanta USA) wrote: “

[[[&#xa0;]]]As this bitter debate continues unabated, it is important to closely look at the reality of climate change as revealed by observations. Among some of the

[[[Climate of the Twentieth Century:]]]Before we consider several other issues on the present climate change debate, it is important to look at the earth’s climate and growth of atmospheric CO2 for the twentieth century, for which best observational information is now available.&#xa0;&#xa0;When carefully analyzed, these observational lampposts suggest that “the link between human-CO2 emissions and climate warming remains questionable as ever!”&#xa0;

[[[Concluding Remarks:]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The latest release of the IPCC AR5 SPM leaves lot to be desired! The SPM claims linkage between warming of the earth’s climate of the last fifty years with increasing concentrations of human-CO2, but provides NO substantive evidence to support this claim!  Further the SPM has failed to explain the hiatus in the warming for the last 16 years! Finally the SPM has totally ignored the reality of earth’s climate, which is that “The earth’s climate now appears to be entering into a colder epoch!” With the approaching of the solar grand minima in the next decade or about, there is now a distinct possibility that the earth’s climate could see an onset of an

[[[ef Bio-data of Madhav Khandekar]]] Madhav Khandekar was born and brought up in central India and vividly recalls experiencing max temperatures of 110-115F ( 43-46C) in the mid-1940s during the pre-monsoon months of April-May. Khandekar graduated with an M Sc degree in Statistics from Pune University (India) in 1957 and worked as a statistical assistant in the India Meteorological Department at Pune for about five years. Khandekar joined the Florida State University (USA) on a Fulbright Scholarship and graduated with an M S (1964) and a PH.D.(1968) in Meteorology.Khandekar worked as a Research Fellow with NRC (National Research Council, Canada) and later as a Research Scientist with Environment Canada. Khandekar wrote a book “Operational Analysis &amp; Prediction of Ocean wind Waves’ published by Springer-Verlag in 1989 while at Environment Canada. Khandekar continues his research on various issues re; the present debate on global warming, climate change and future impact on world humanity since retiring from Environment CanadaKhandekar’s latest report “The Global Warming-Extreme Weather link: A review of the state of science’ has been published by the Global Warming Policy Foundation in the UK (GWPF Report 11: ISBN: 978-0-9573880-1-7; published November 2013)&#xa0;&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
