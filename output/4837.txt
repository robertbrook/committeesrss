The paper identifies the group of people who can be influenced to plan and implement safety measures to eliminate danger posed to cyclist due to a collision scenario. Author gathered ideas from the current research being conducted to solve the problem faced by cyclist and represented these ideas in the hazard and barrier modelling and analysis in the Submission.&#xa0;&#xa0;During the last 10 years or so, he has specialised in the activity of modelling and analysis of safety critical system and accidents following the generalising the process and information decision making framework contained in the IEC 61508, a generic safety standard, to conduct hazard identification and analysis using the Management Oversight and Risk Tree.  &#xa0;Author‘s expertise in system safety engineering research is evidenced by the publications of six peer reviewed publications at the Institute of Engineers and Technology ( IET) International System Safety Conferences in 2006, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. Author worked as a Command Controls Signalling Engineer promoting the idea of System Approach to Safety at RSSB from 2004 till 2010.  &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[press.com/2012/06/08/bow-roundabout/]]]&#xa0;At 08:45 AM GMT at Bow Roundabout on 13th November 2013, Venera Minakhmetova, 24, was waiting for the East Bound Early Cycle Start Signal to clear. As soon as the traffic signal cleared she made a decision to start cycling. Within a distance of few metres she was horrified to found herself hit by a lorry. The resulting collision event, a tragic event, took away her precious life before any medical help could be afforded to her. &#xa0;Approximately year ago, Transport for London installed an Early Start Traffic Light Scheme at the Bow Roundabout to improve safety at the Bow Roundabout (BBC News, 2013). Prior to this safety intervention, a Cycle Super Highways (Blue Colour pathway) Scheme was introduced by the Transport for London in 2010. Transport for London took a decision to make these interventions after consultation with cycling, road user and safety organisations (Mayor of London, May 2013).The actions of various people directly involved in the tragic situation are examined hereafter using the information afforded by the Transport for London video showing the Concept of Operations. Concept of Operations is a systems engineering term to describe to the user how to use the proposed system. More details on Concept of Operations can be accessed on the Web.a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The woman cyclist (Person A) was afforded information by the Early Start Bicycle Signal System to go West on her planned route starting from Cycle Super Highway CS2 Advanced Stop Line (ASL).  b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Lorry driver (Person B) was afforded information by the Road traffic Signal System to go across on his planned route few moments later. c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The specification and implementation of the Road Traffic Control System, Early Start Signal System and Cycle Superhighway CS2 Advanced Stop Line assumed that cycle and lorry routes do not conflict with each other following the installation of the Early Start Bicycle Signal System and CS2 Advanced Stop Line. &#xa0;From the above it is clear that both woman cyclist and the lorry driver did not have any visual perception of each other’s route IS in conflict in the circular (shared space) passageway away from the Cycle Super Highway CS2. &#xa0;Conjunction of the three events transformed normal safe acts of cycling and vehicle driving into unsafe acts posing risk to life of Venera Minakhmetova. Author speculates at this stage of investigation that this conjunction of events went unrecognised at the planning, review and delivery stages of the schemes. Perhaps, the integrated risk assessment and reviews were not conducted by traffic engineers or designers or contractors as they were conducted for the London Olympics 2012. Author discounts the possibility that the skills of dead cyclist and lorry driver were deficient in this case. Nor was this case of hit-run accident as the lorry driver stopped after the accident. &#xa0;The text in the following section presents the idea of Systems Thinking Approach to Safety. This approach was presented by author in his publication in 2006 and in free online publication in 2012 (Appicharla, 2006), (Appicharla, 2012). This follows the Soft Systems Thinking tradition started by Peter Checkland (Checkland, 2000). &#xa0;The hypotheses underlying the Systems Thinking Approach to Safety are as under:a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Release of harmful energy is a prior condition/state to any physical event involving harm b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Lack of protective measures to mitigate the harmful energy so released leads to injuries, loss of limbs and livesc)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Managerial oversights and assumed risk (acceptable risks are risks accepted by an authority after a formal risk assessment) are fallible decisions that trigger the accidental flow of events. &#xa0;The single factor behind the lack of availability of safety measures to guard against the release of hazardous energy is the systematic errors committed (inherent biases) in safety evaluations and risk assessments. Therefore, the utility of Systems Thinking Approach to Safety lies in screening out of hazardous scenarios from the concept of operations itself such that either the activity itself can be modified or specification of the infrastructure and control systems may be written in a such way that probability of hazardous scenarios can be eliminated or controlled to the extent that it is no longer a cause for concern. &#xa0;Objections against the utility of Systems Thinking Approach to Safety by the adherents of traditional probabilistic and/or statistical approach to risk management are answered in this way. Traditional method of estimating numerically the risk posed by an activity using the data collected from past accidents and by treating accident fatalities as a random variable does not yield insight into whether the activity is itself is safe or not due to availability and representative biases (pp137) (Kahneman, 2011). &#xa0;Traditional decision making process entails making choices for the future to solve a given problem with various constraints impinging upon the solution. Both in theory and practise, utilitarian decision making entails a view to be taken of prevalent state of affair(s) and partition them into risk less and risky choices . This representation takes the shape of an event tree diagram and probabilities are worked out against each outcome used in probabilistic risk assessment used by risk assessor and managers. The details of probabilistic risk assessment and its inadequacy to deal with human error were discussed by James Reason and therefore, not discussed again (pp219) (Reason, 1990). &#xa0;Prospect theory advanced by Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman and his collaborator, Amos Tversky, highlights errors in the traditional utilitarian decision making and suggest the idea that emotions of hope and fear colour the choices we make when we want confront the problem of decision making under risk. Thus, drawing lessons from the Prospect Theory and his own 2010 publication author arrives at the judgement that long standing debate on morality and economics of safety can be concluded in favour of morality. Author’s 2010 publication argued that Group-think bias is major factor in decision making when setting safety standards was noted by  (Appicharla, 2010). &#xa0;The Figure 1 presents the data given by Danny Williams, a cyclist blogger to the BBC News.

However, the figure compared against a scientific criterion of chances of death per million, it is clear that the human activity of cycling in London has become dangerous.&#xa0;Figure 2 Scatter graph representation &#xa0;The risk assessment criterion of one chance per million opportunities is derived from Ian Murphy’s 1997 publication (Murphy, 1997). Apart from one outlier (2008) during the observational period where the metric went down to 8 fatalities, the fatalities have been consistently in the double figure range. Further, statistics perspective of fatalities calculated are mean=15.6, median = 15.5, mode is 19 and standard deviation is 4.32. From these figures, using a Poisson probability distribution, the probability of first fatality is less than .04%.  Author is of the opinion that cautious behaviour on part of the cyclists and road drivers shows up as a constraint upon the accident fatalities in accordance with Dr Ashby’s perspective (Ashby, 1957). &#xa0;Author has noted that risk of death from a cardio vascular heart disease (CVD) is greater than risk than death from a cycle accident. It is expected by World Health Organisation that some 23.3 million deaths are likely due to CVD in 2030.  The most important behavioural risk factors of heart disease and stroke are unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use and harmful use of alcohol. Behavioural risk factors are responsible for about 80% of coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease. &#xa0;However, the text in this section shows that research into behavioural attitudes of cyclists as suggested by Transport for London document is not useful activity. Let us consider the fact that in 2009 there were 13 fatalities and 3396 injuries (see Chapter 2 London Transport document).  From these figures it can be inferred that there were 3409 collision events between a cyclist and other vehicle in the following manner. &#xa0;Using the Bayesian Rules of conditional probabilities, we can work out the probabilities of human actors’ performance  (Pal &amp; Sarkar, 2005). Total number of collision events reported in 2009= 3409. For risk computational purposes, it is assumed that there are 10,000 hours per annum. Let P (B) denote the total probability of interactions between road vehicle and cyclists. The base rate of injurious collisions events per year suffered by cyclists= P (A) = 3409/10000= 0.3409The base rate of non –fatal non- injurious interaction events per year = P (AC) = 1-0.3409= 0.6591The probability of a fatality given a collision situation = P (B/A) = 13/3409= .00381The probability of an injury given a collision situation = P (BC/A) = 3396/3409=0.99619.&#xa0;The number of events in which road vehicle driver’s unreliability is indicated by the ratio = P (BC/AC) = 13*6561/3409= 25. Thus, the probability of fatality involving a cyclist’s unreliable performance in creating a collusion situation = 13/13+25= .3411 or 34%. The rest 66% contribution to danger can be attributed to road users and other authorities. This way of calculation can be evaluated using the example of accident analysis given by the Bayesian inference by Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman (Kahneman, 2011). &#xa0;James Reason (1990) argued that problem solvers tend to over simply causality (pp91) (Reason, 1990). Causal explanations suffer from various kinds of biases. Author has noted the fact Nobel Laureate Bertrand Russell’s perceptual account of everyday world of seeing, hearing, touching, smelling and tasting substances is an illusion. Bertrand Russell may be echoing the ancient statement of Epicharamus that it is the mind that sees and hears; all besides is deaf and blind is stated by Arthur Schopenhauer (Schopenhaeur, 1813/2006).  According to Arthur Schopenhauer, to order to contemplate an explanation for a particular thing, one must assume that there is subject (oneself) that thinks about the object (to be explained). However, in the cases of explaining a sequence of events that led to an accidental death, we must be carefully to avoid repeating errors committed by David Hume and Immanuel Kant in their causal explanations. David Hume asserts that all consequence is mere sequence of perceptions whereas Kant affirms that all sequence of perceptions must necessarily be consequence. The law of causality is not known to us empirically but is given a priory (pp 106/107) (Schopenhaeur, 1813/2006). &#xa0;Overthrowing of causality as suggested by Bertrand Russell following the sceptical philosophy of David Hume is not a remedy in the hope that science has absorbed all philosophy (Russell, 1945), (Rasmussen, et al., 1994).  This idea is evidenced from the writings of Nobel Laureate Albert Einstein, author of relativity theories, who urged us to consider the role of causal reasoning in scientific explanations. An illustration of causal reasoning stated by Albert Einstein is given. By means of comparison of steam arising from water boiling in a pan heated on a gas stove with a steam not arising from the adjacent pan not lit, Albert Einstein argued that heat is the cause for the effect of steam arising from the pan(pp72) (Einstein, 1920). &#xa0;Most of us do not take into account Lorentz transformations when computing distances is suggested by Nobel Laureate Albert Einstein. Nor do we take into account statistical and causal base rates when computing risk is suggested by Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman. From these observations made by Albert Einstein (1920) and Daniel Kahneman (1974), author concludes from the foregoing discussions that there is a strong demand to be aware of biases (or thumb rules) presents in our own intuitions and distort judgement(s) or decision(s).&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The text in this section presents the hazard model in the form of HAZOP, EBTA and MORT worksheets in tabular form to represent the hazard faced by a cyclist, its causes and consequences as a desktop study.

Collision area is any area beyond as designated CS2.  2. This is a partial HAZOP study. 3. Use of such above tables without a safety management expert supervision is not recommended. &#xa0;&#xa0;The Table 1 shows that human (latent failures) committed by various stakeholder(s) organisations dominate the rare and bad event of a cyclist accidental death. The stakeholder organisations range from the legislative (central and local) assemblies, academic, research and supply organisations who advise the departments within the statutory transport organisations, and organisations investigating road accidents as well.  From the partial HAZOP study it can be inferred that accelerating motorised traffic relative to cyclist is an occupational hazard. Because in a relative (from Albert Einstein’s perspective) universe, inertial path is less than accelerated path or in geometric terms, the diagonal of a triangle is less than sum of it sides is shown by Sir Roger Penrose (Penrose, 2004). &#xa0;Having established the fact that the Traffic Light System can induce errors and contribute a collision hazard, it is necessary to pay attention to the barriers that can prevent and protect the cyclist from this occupation hazard. Pedestrians are also killed due to error in the specification of traffic light systems. A road user may be presented with a green aspect and motorised traffic with a flashing amber aspect thus giving rise to an opportunity for an accelerating motor traffic   to collide with a pedestrian. This aspect is usually ignored by safety researchers. For example, a study of Transport for London on Pedestrian Safety completely ignored role of traffic lights and focused on behavioural aspects and measures to remedy the behaviour. &#xa0;

The 13th November 2013 at Bow Roundabout accident occurred away from CS2 and there is no evidence that cyclist did jump red signal nor cut across the truck. See news reports cited above. &#xa0;3. The traffic engineer’s idea that compliance with rules of cycle early start traffic light system ( two stop lines and early cycle start system) and the CS2 are sufficient elements to form a system to afford safety to cyclists is inferred from the above video. The above video assumes that the trajectory of the cyclists and motorised vehicles are different because early start given to the cyclists. In others words, it assumes that whole of motorised traffic movement at Bow Roundabout in their nature acts per classical Newton’s mechanics law that particles sufficiently removed in distance continue to move uniformly in a straight line(pp71) (Einstein, 1920). &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[ ]]]Venera Minakhmetova was struck by the lorry. This paper assumes that she may have been avoiding an obstruction on the road ahead or the lorry driver may have mis-judged her movements. &#xa0;The Economist Report dated 28 the April 2012 noted that British traffic engineers are aware that capacity effects are different after an intervention. The concept of shared spaces on roads work for different reasons than what traffic engineers and transport policy makes envisaged: British road vehicle drivers abandon the roads (like Exhibition Road in London and New Road in Brighton) where concept of shared space by pedestrians and motorised traffic is introduced and parallel roads are available. From a cultural perspective, concept of shared space is welcomed by British motor vehicle drivers. &#xa0;Loisue Butcher discussed the the legislative and other related issues in the House of Commons Library Standard Note SN 2254 dated 2 May 2012. The Submission by author draws attention to the concerns not identified in the May 2012 paper. &#xa0;No formal hazard identification and analysis procedures and risk assessments were applied by Transport for London prior to making changes to traffic light schemes at Bow Roundabout.From the inspection of the data, reasoning advanced by various stakeholders, and efforts to improve the safety of cyclist being currently undertaken by various research agencies, it is concluded by the author that specification of Scoot traffic control systems and road infrastructure (ASL, CS2) to afford safe passage to both cyclists and heavy vehicles needs a fundamental rethink on the part of traffic engineers and managers.  Their awareness of human factors and systems safety engineering and occupational hazard causal factors is less than adequate. This is the group of people in various organisations that is required to be influenced to achieve a safe road junction(s) for the cyclists and road users. The key performance indicator for the safety performance, in author’s judgement, is that over the next 10 years is that the mean of cyclist fatalities in over next 10 years has to be zero. &#xa0;&#xa0;A.G.Hessami, 2012.

Suffolk: The Health and Safety Executive.&#xa0;This section describes in general the concept of system approach to safety. This section introduced to draw a clear distinction between system approach to safety and system approach to safety assurance. Both of these methods are described in freely available online publication (Appicharla, 2012), (A.G.Hessami, 2012).  &#xa0;The third information item on page 3 may be surprising to an unfamiliar reader.  However, those who are conversant with the works of Dr Ashby work on Cybernetics know that information conveyed by a traffic light with a cycle symbol display contains a variety of messages (Ashby, 1957).  The meanings assigned to the elements of the set of messages Red, Amber, and Green such as Stop, Caution and Go may appear unambiguous to the reader but physically these messages introduce ambiguity. There are cyclic transitions between aspects from Red to Red-Yellow, Yellow to Green and Green-Yellow –Red to command stopped traffic to move and command a flowing traffic to a halt. Out of probable nine states (lit, unlit and failed state and ignoring the transitions pointed out earlier) only five are utilised by the road user to infer. In other words, a fraction of 5/8= .625 fraction of the probable states from user perspective is useful. Thus, the quantity of information used by a user of the traffic light system is only 62.5% and the rest 37.5% are don’t care situations. Apart from this, the specification of the twin traffic lights systems assumes a mathematical Cartesian Framework of Co-ordinate system in infrastructure planning and delivery:  the eastbound cyclist has an early start and therefore will not be in conflict with the left turning vehicles. It is hard to imagine the role of non-Euclidean frameworks of Geometry in daily modern work life.  &#xa0;Reactions to the Bow Roundabout accident by various stakeholders reported in the general press varied depending upon their roles: cyclist, lorry driver, commissioner of transport or CEO of a charitable organisation, and the Mayor of London. Cyclist Commissioner, Andrew Gilligan, took a  pessimistic view that designing out hazards is not feasible (BBC News, 2013). The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, as a knee jerk reaction promised to invest one billion UK pounds of funds over next ten years to improve safety of the cyclists and appears to be sharing the same view advanced by Andrew Gilligan by admitting the idea that no traffic engineer in the world can imagine every eventuality that can occur on the road. &#xa0;Author does not consider the proposition of how person A can harm person B unintentionally at a road junction cannot be imagined by a group of traffic engineers, given the past history of such occurrences. However, author considers it is realistic to consider the idea that traffic engineers may be impaired in their ability to plan for safety improvements without giving rise to unintended effects.  Because they may be under cognitive stress to balance safety risk concerns against a legal and cost decision criterion and thus, may be biased in their approach to hazards management. Author notes that Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman argued successfully that there is no such thing as cost efficient risk management criteria when moral intuitions are taken into account (Kahneman, 2011). &#xa0;&#xa0;Safety and the avoidance of risk are major concerns in any engineering activity. For more details on various interpretations of the word, risk, readers may wish to consult the paper hosted on the Stanford University Website (Hansson, 2011). There is an extensive discussion on the epistemological understanding and deﬁnition of risk in a paper published by Catherine E. Althaus in 2005 (Althaus, 2005). Catherine E. Althaus argued in her 2005 paper that story of history about risk may be dating back 3102 BCE and other ancient civilisations. From a hindsight perspective, author infers that the chanting of peace mantras by the sages of the Upanishads indicates awareness of concept of harm and peace on their part dating back to 3000 BCE as per some historians of ancient India (Valerie, 2003). Thus, author does not feel that there are any novel ideas about risk assessment and management of sources of harm (hazards) in this submission.   From a human error (Swiss Cheese Model) perspective, active errors are errors whose effects are felt immediately and latent errors are whose effects lay dormant for a time period. Human error experts acknowledge the idea that Management Oversight ad Risk Tree is a technique that can be used for organisational analysis and safety studies in the published literature and on Wikipedia database (Rasmussen, et al., 1994).  Based upon the reading of the foregoing philosophical and psychological papers  author is of the professional opinion that every accident can be prevented: blaming the active human errors on the part of the cyclist and/or truck driver involved in the accident, and/or defending the latent human error on the part of traffic engineer and managers, and/or entertaining the naïve hope of raising awareness on the part of the cyclist or the heavy vehicle (lorry or bus driver) through technology, and/or accepting the theological position that such events are all acts of God  is no solution to the problem faced by the cyclist. Because cyclist accidental death arises from known physical, situational and cognitive factors and these factors may be managed through application of right resources: prioritising safety is absolutely necessary when using information control systems via modern technology that can unintentionally release harmful energy. An instance where these facts go recognised familiar to the author is drawn from the railway transport domain. Besides author, German academic aviation researchers and DB railways are not convinced of the ability of the new European automatic train control system, ETCS, in averting hypothetical collisions between trains (Appicharla, 2013). An IEEE paper published by Armin Zimmermann and Gunter Hommel of Technical Berlin University in 2003 observed that probability of trains braking under GSM-R radio based automatic train control system operating in moving block system is 94% for the time deadline of 6 seconds, braking distance of 4500 metres, length of 410 metres. The probability worsens with increase of time deadline and braking distance. Thus, positive safety performance of ETCS can be regarded as doubtful. Further, this conviction finds support in the case of metro train control system failures as well. The cancellation of Bombardier’s Signalling Contract by Transport for London is a evidence in support of the assertion made. Despite the contrary and relevant evidence from three sources, the European Railway Agency and GB Railway Industry organisations consider promoting the European Train Control System (ETCS) as a satisficing strategy. Developing a common safety regulating strategy to promote ETCS as a standard automatic train control system is the main focus of managerial attention at this point of time. Author agrees to the idea that German aviation and DB railway researchers were right in drawing their readers’ attention to the inherent weakness in the ETCS technology. But German aviation researchers have not considered the contribution of latent human errors in the specification of the TCAS device in 2002 accident prior to thinking about the solution to the problem of rail and/or road accident situations.  Apart from the sources cited, author has learnt that practitioners in the safety critical railway domain suffer from lack of awareness of Systems Thinking Approach to Safety as well. This inference is drawn from reading Ali Hessami’s work on safety assurance approach (A.G.Hessami, 2012). Ali Hessami is the main author of the Yellow Book and CENELEC railway specific safety standards used by Network Rail, ORR, RSSB, ATOC and Transport for London Railway Organisations for safety assurance.  Ali Hessami follows the traditional methods of safety assurance assuming the equation user error equals human error. In his previous role of Head of System Safety, Ali Hessami promoted the Yellow Book for Engineering Safety Management methods. The utility of application of Yellow Book type or fault and event tree modelling process for supporting safety critical decisions is learnt from the example as these procedures cannot be used for modelling fallible decisions that shape the performance of operators or users of electrical/programmable/ software electronic control systems. James Reason (1990) observed that failure types that originate at the management layers and take the shape of fallible decisions and finding ways to neutralising these the major challenge facing human factor researchers with preserving the safety of complex, high risk systems. This Submission has shown how the fallible decisions when implemented that pose danger to a cyclist from a particular example of Bow Roundabout Accident can be revealed without conducting deep mathematical and psychological research. Author has noted that risk can be approached in several ways and has made efforts to include all the perspectives into the accident modelling and analysis. &#xa0;January 201418&#xa0; More details can be accessed from the URL: http://beta.tfl.gov.uk/travel-information/improvements-and-projects/bow-roundabout More details can be accessed from the URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_of_operations More details can be accessed from the URL: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-24925390 More details can be accessed from the URL: http://www.hse.gov.uk/research/rrpdf/rr941.pdf More details can be accessed from the URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk More details can be accessed from the URL: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-24989985.
