"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten submission from the Global Partnership for Education Secretariat&#xa0;\nTo t\nhe \nUnited Kingdom\n’s Parliamentary\n \nInquiry \ninto\n Disability and Development\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe UK’s work with other development agencies and partner governments on disability&#xa0;1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis \nsubmission outlines the Global Partnership for Education’\ns (t\nhe \n‘\nGlobal Partnership’\n or ‘GPE’\n) support for\n inclusive education and children with special needs\n, of which the UK\n government\n \nis a major partner\n. \nMore specifically, the submission outline\ns\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;(i)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInclusive \neducation sector analysis and planning\n – explicit support for inclusive education is articulated in the GPE guidelines for education sector plan development and appraisal\n(ii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEvaluation of \nthe ‘inclusiveness’ of \nexisting education sector plans\n – the \nMonitoring\n and Evaluation (M&amp;E) team of the \nGPE Secretariat is \nconducting a comprehensive\n evaluation\n of member countries’ education sector plans\n. \n The evaluation\n includes an equity dimension that assesses, for example, whether sector plans address education for chil\ndren wi\nth special needs\n(iii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDirect support for children with special needs - \nSeveral GPE grants directly finance education activities for children with special needs. I\nn \nCambodia\n,\n for example, a GPE grant of US \n$\n57.4 million for th\ne period 2008-2012 supported\n the Ministry of Education and Youth to conduct a survey on the needs of marginalized and disabled children excluded from education\n.\n Similarly\n,\n in \nMoldova\n a GPE grant of \nUS \n$\n4.4 \nmillion for the period 2012 to 2014 aims to improve\n access, quality and inclus\niveness of preschool education\n(iv)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSupport for children with sp\necial needs at the \nglobal \nand regional \nlevel \n-\n through the Global and Regional \nActivities \nProgram\n, \nfor example,\n \na GPE grant of \nUS \n$\n3 million \nfor the period 2014 to 2015 aims \nto improve the \nmanagement of moderate disabilities of school-age children through school based health interventions to ensure children, especially girls, complete primary education.\n \nIn addition, \nthe \nGlobal Partnership\n has \nput in place a\n Data Strategy for Improved Educati\non Sector Planning and Implementation\n \nto address data gaps, including data on children with disabilities, in GPE countries.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Global Partnership for Education\n \n(GPE) \nis \nthe \nonly multilateral partnership devoted to getting all children into school for a good quality education. The Global Partnership \n– made up of governments, civil society organizations, international \ninstitutions, teachers, private foundations, and the private sector – provides funding to support the development and implementation of high-quality education sector plans\n \nin the w\norld’s poorest countries and  helps\n \ncoordinate support arou\nnd those plans.\n F\nundamental to the\n Global Partnership’s work is ensuring\n education \nsector \nplans\n \nare \ninclusive and \nmeet the educational \nneeds \nof all children\n. \nIn its report to the UN Secretary General in May 2013, the \nUnited Nations High-Level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda highlighted:\n&#xa0;\n‘The Global Partnership for Education is getting quality education to marginalized children, coordinating education’s many players, offering aid without wasteful replication, and following local leadership’\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nWith the support of the UK and a number of other donor partners, the \nGlobal Partnership has \ntransformed international cooperation in education in developing countries.\n Since 2002, it has helped to pioneer the coordination of development partners in support of nationally owned \nand implemented education sector plans. In doing so, the GPE has \nimproved the alignment of external \ntechnical and financial resources with sustain\nable\n, nationally relevant\n education strategies\n. Due to the value of GPE processes in improving education development and the catalytic impact of GPE financing on system strengthening in the education sector, GPE has become one of the most significant sourc\nes of education financing for the poorest countries in the world. \n&#xa0;\n2.3\n              \nSince 2009, \nthe Global Partnership has implemented widespread \nreforms to further strengthen the partnership and help it to deliver better results. \nThe\n \nUK MAR\n \n2013 Update\n ranks GPE progress \nagainst \nthe MAR reform priorities as the fourth highest \nof all multilateral organizations \nassessed in\n the original review\n. \nFurther revisions\n are planned including of the GPE Fund \nto ensure it \nrespond\ns\n to the increase in\n demand for\n \nfun\nding in the most effective and efficient way\n. \nNew commitments\n from the UK and other donor partners for the repleni\nshment of the Global Partnership\n for the pe\nriod 2015 – 2018 \nwill help \nfurther \naccelerate \ndeveloping country \nprogress towards ensuring \nall\n chil\ndren receive a\n quality education, in\ncluding children with disabilities\n and other marginalized\n groups\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe GPE Strategic Plan 2012 – 2015 commits the partnership to support children who are the most marginalized and \nto \nbuilding national systems that have the capacity and integrity to deliver, support and assess quality education for all\n, including\n children with disability\n. \nT\nhe GPE strategic\n goals are\n access for all, learning for all, reachi\nng every child, and building for the\n future. The \nImplementation Plan for GPE’s Strategic Plan includes a specific outcome on the access of children with disabilities to inclusive and quality learning. It further com\nmits GPE and its partners to support the creation of inclusive educa\ntion systems, in particular: \n&#xa0;\nenvironments f\nor children with disabilities\neffective\nne\nss to improve learning outcomes for marginalized children, in particular children with disabilities.\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nGlobal Partnership’s approach is comprehensive, supporting inclusive educa\ntion and the education of children with special needs \nat the country\n, regional\n and global level.\n \nSpecifically, GPE support\ns inclusive education and children with special needs \nas follows\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Support at the country level &#xa0;\n3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInclusive education sector analysis and planning – explicit \ns\nupport for \ninclusive education is articulated\n in \nthe \nGPE \nGuid\ne\nlines\n \nfor education sector plan development and appraisal\n.\n \nThese guidelines make specific reference to \nthe need for consideration of \ndisability\n in the process of education sector plan preparation, education sector plan appraisal, implementation strategies and targeted monitoring\n.\n \nF\nor example, \nin preparation for th\ne development of an education sector plan, \nsector analysis should include analysis of the needs and situation of marginalized groups, in\ncluding children with disabilities\n. \nT\nhe\n appraisal section o\nf the Guidelines, which guides development p\nartners’ assessme\nnt and endorsement of the sector plan (on which eligibility for GPE funding is based)\n, also refers \nto disability. It promotes\n \nt\narg\net setting \nfor each of the m\narginalized and at-risk groups \nsuch\n as children with disabilities as well as \nunderserved communiti\nes, girls, the poor, orphans, children in hard to reach communities, ethnic minorities, refugee and internally displaced populations, and chil\ndren affected by HIV and AIDS\n. The guidelines\n also promote\n the identification of \nspecific strategies and activitie\ns\n to ensure equity in the provision of basic inputs across these \ngroups \nas well as \nan inclusive \napproach to\n mainstreaming support to marginalized group\ns.\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEvaluation of the ‘inclusiveness’ of existing education sector plans –\n \nthe Monitoring and Evaluation \n(M&amp;E) team of the G\nPE Secretariat is conducting a comprehensive \nevaluation of member countries’ edu\ncation sector plans.  The evaluation\n includes an equity dimension that assesses, for example, whether sector plans address education for children with special needs.\n It will inform improvements to sector monitoring and help to identify data gaps\n. \nThe evaluation is expected \nto be concluded by\n mid-2014. \nPrevious analyses \nindicate s\nector plans in a number of \nG\nPE – endorsed countries\n i\nnclude specific strategies\n to target childre\nn\n with special needs, and\n \ndeta\niled \na\nctivities and timelines\n.  \nGuyana’s education sector plan, for exampl\ne, includes \nspecific activities such as conducting a national study to determine the number of \nstudents with special needs as well as \ncreating special resource centers\n.\n \nSimilarly, \nEthiopia has adopted a strategy for special needs education within its education sector \nprogram.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDirect support for children with special needs - s\neveral GPE\n grants \ndirectly \nfinance \neducation activities \nfor children with special needs\n. \nIn\n \nCambodia, \nfor example, \na GPE grant of US\n \n$\n57.4 million for the period 2008-2012 \nis supporting\n the Ministry of Edu\ncation and \nYouth \nto conduct a survey on the needs of marginalized and disabled children excluded from education. \nA total of \n13,175 children aged 11-15 were screened  in 56 elementary schools under t\nhe Out-of-School and Disability Survey\n, which used a state-of-the-art methodology for data collection and referring to services of children with disabilities and impairments, and provided them with ey\ne \nglasses at the low cost of US\n \n$\n2 a pair. For the first time, the survey also provided high-q\nuality data on disability and education, which enabled the Ministry to plan and budget for more targeted intervent\nions, and ultimately better addr\ness the issue of access to primary education for the most marginalized. As a result, the out-of-school populat\nion in Cambodia was halved between 2007 and 2011, a large part of which was due to a significant increase in the am\nount of disabled children \nable to attend school. Unde\nr this initiative,\n t\neachers from 56 schools were trained on \nvision testing so teachers \ncan\n assess \nwhether children need\n to be referred for refraction or for an eye exam. \nThe results of the GPE-funded surv\ney were also shared with other\n Ministries and development partners in Cambodia, prompting a number of education programs to support childre\nn with disabilities and impairments. These initiatives range from inclusive teacher training, to disability awareness campaigns, and vision and hearing screenings for children in primary schools.\n&#xa0;\n3.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSimilarly, \nMoldova is currently implementing a GPE grant \nof\n US\n \n$\n4.4 million \nfor the period 2012 to 2014, with the aim of\n improving access, quality and inclusiveness of preschool education. \nThe grant\n is a continuation of two successfully comp\nleted grants\n implemented from 2006 to 2010\n. \nSince 2006, \nGPE has provided \nMoldova with\n \ntechnical assistance to revise\n sanitary reforms and legislation encouraging inclusive approaches, as well as the promotion of integrated services across the education, health\n and social protection sectors. \nMoldova \nhas \nalso developed key docume\nnts promoting inclusiveness such as standards for learning and development of children (from birth to 7 years old), standards for pre-school teachers, and a guide on socio-educational inclusiveness of children with disabilities, and continues\n to promote in\nclusive approaches\n through a broader teac\nher training/mentoring program. \nWith the support of GPE\n, \ntwo \n‘pilot’ \ncenters \nhave been established \nfor \nthe \nrehabilitation of children with special needs within mainstream kindergartens in Straseni and in Criuleni (respectively 15 and 24 children benefitted). \nMore recently, GPE funding supported\n the establishment of one additional rehabilitation center for child\nren with disabilities in Ceadir Lunga UTAG Gagauzia (61 beneficiaries), and \nthere are \nplans are to create a similar center in Nisporeni (17 exp\nected beneficiaries). \nGPE support \nhas also \nhelped \nto \nleverage support from other partners, such as UNICEF and loc\nal NGOs, for the inclusion of children with special needs in mainstream institutions.\n&#xa0;\nSupport at the global and regional level&#xa0;3.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSupport for children with special needs through the Global and Regional Activities (GRA) Program \n- \nthe GRA Program supports \ncapacity development, knowledge sharing and knowledge development at the regional and global levels and is complementary to the country level process. It fosters innovation through the systematic provision of services and products that enlighten, engage, a\nnd energize partners to apply new knowledge and evidence based good practices to resolve education challenges\n. A proposal \nsubmitted by the World Bank \nwas\n approved \nin July 2013 \nfor \nUS \n$3 million to im\nprove the management of moderate disabilities of school-a\nge children through school based health interventions to ensure children, especially gi\nrls,\n complete primary education. T\nhe \nprogram aims to \nimprove learning outcomes and access to education in 15 GPE developing partner countries\n, including 10 countries in \nAfrica and 5 in Southeast Asia\n. The program will address knowledge gaps in operational and technical understanding of disability and provide the support needed to include children with disabilities, impairments and untreated health conditions to prevent th\nem from dropping out, and to improve access to education. \nThe activity will be managed by the World Bank in cooperation with WHO, Sight Savers, Save the Children, Partnership for Child Development, Imperial College, Children Without Worms and national NGOs\n will be involved at country level. \n&#xa0;\n3.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nData Strategy for Improved Education Sector Planning and Implementation – in \nmany \nGPE \ncountries\n the \nlack of reliable data, including data on children with disab\nilities, remains\n a major constraint\n. This is especially \nthe case in fragile and conflict-affected states, which account for almost half of GPE’s overall country portfol\nio. As noted in the\n MAR Update 2013, the Global Partnership has already made considerable progress in the area of results by \nintroducing a syste\nmatic framework for aggregated resu\nlts reporting, and by \npublishing an increasing volume of data o\nn its work. \nThese reforms have enhanced GPE’s\n capa\ncity to assess the \nextent \nto which \nGPE-endorsed education sector plans address \ndisability, and whether the \neducati\nonal needs of all children are addressed in GPE countries\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn addition, \nthe Partnership has recently pu\nt in place a\n Data Strategy for I\nmproved Education Sector Planning and Implementation\n. \nT\nhe strategy outlines a \ncomprehensive approach to address\nin\ng\n a number of data-related challen\nges in \nGPE countries\n, particularly in relation\n to the need for timely reliable data as a basis for effective monitoring of the implementation of education sector plans.\n \nThe \nnew\n strategy \nsets out a number of concrete steps \nthe GP\nE intends to take in this regard, including\n: \n&#xa0;\n \n              \ndeveloping a proposal for finan\ncing education sector analysis\n&#xa0;\nThe\n \nnew strategy\n will help the \nGlob\nal \nPartnership \nto \nbetter measure the impact of its work at country-level, \nand in addressing the education needs of all children\n.\n&#xa0;4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA major r\nevision of the GPE f\nund\ni\nng model is \nunderway to maximize\n the efficient and effe\nctive use of GPE r\nesources \nin order to \nhelp \nachieve its mission\n. Taking into \nconsideration the results of \nthe MAR, lessons learned and \nfeedback \nfrom its partners, the revised\n funding model will\n incentivize and reward the delivery of results against strategic plan objectives, development effectiveness and increasing value for money; and leverage additional domestic and e\nxternal financing for ed\nucation\n. \n&#xa0;\n4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRevision of the GPE\n Fund will precede \nrepl\nenishment of the Global Partnership\n \n(\n2015 to 2018\n)\n. The replenishment campaign was announced in Ne\nw York in September, \nand will culminate\n in a pledging conference on the 26\nth\n of June in Brusssels,\n hosted by \nthe EU. The replenishment of the Global Partnersh\nip\n \nis an opportunity for the international community to turn around \nthe current decline in\n donor aid for basic education and leverage\n additional domestic resources to create lasting change.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWith its country-led and inclusive approach, \nthe Global Partnership is an investment in transformative development and a model for the post-2015 framework. \nA s\nuccessful replenishment \nwill\n cement \nGPE’s value-added \nin providing a\n global picture of the extent to which education sector plans address the \neducational needs of the most marginalized\n, and based on this, promote\n inclusive education and best policy and practice for children with special needs\n in GPE \ncountries. \nRenewed\n su\npport will also enable\n the Global Partners\nhi\np to \neffectively champion \ninclusive education and to advocate for\n \nthe \ninclusion\n of \nimportant \neq\nui\nty dimensions of education in\n the\n \npost \n2015\n development agenda. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSince 2002\n,\n the\n \nGlobal \nPartnership has \nallocated near\nly USD \n3.8 billion \n(by the end of 2013) \nto 59 countries in support of education. More than \n40% of GPE’s total disbursement\ns supported children’s education in fragile and conflict-affected countries. Specifically, GPE \nhelped put an additional 58\n million chi\nldren in\n \nprimary \nschool; increased primary school completion rates and literacy rates,\n \nespecially among young girls; and spurred\n \ndeveloping partner governments to increase their domestic financing\n \nfor \nbasic \neducation. \n&#xa0;\n5.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe UK is the largest dono\nr to GPE \nfollowed by Australia and Denmark. Under\n GPE’s 2011-2014 replenishment cy\ncle the UK\n has\n pledged over USD\n \n400 million\n (subse\nquently revised to over USD\n \n475 million\n), and has \nhelped the \nGlobal \nPartnership achieve significant results particularly in the area \nof girls’ education, learning and education in fragile and conflict-affected states\n. The UK is also \na member of the GPE Board of Directors - Do\nnor Constituency 3, and is a \nSupervising Entity\n for \nGPE grants\n in Rwanda and Zambia.\n&#xa0;\n5.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn 2011, the UK MAR\n \nhighlig\nhted several strengths for the Globa\nl Partnership\n including\n:\n \nthe allocation of a significant portion (65%) of its resources to countries in the top quartile of \nthe index of poor countries; its strong contribution\n to MDGs 2\n and 3\n; and positive reforms in\n \nrelation to \ngovernance, finan\ncing and results. The review\n \nalso \nsuggest\ned a number of priority reforms\n, particularly in the\n areas of \nresults and strategic and performance management. \nThe\n \nrecently published \nMAR \nUpdate 2013 ranks GPE\n fourt\nh \nof all multilatera\nl organizations \nreviewed \nfor progress against \nthe \nreform prio\nrities\n identified in\n the original review\n.
