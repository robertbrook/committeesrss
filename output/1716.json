"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2Co Energy was established three years ago as \na\n dedicated CCS company.  It has a particular strategic focus on us\ning\n CO\n2\n for\n E\nnhanced Oil Recovery which reduces the overall cost of CCS.\n2Co Energy Limited \nis the developer of the Don Valley CCS \npower \nproject – the only \nCCS project\n in the UK to have both its planning permission and to have completed the Front End Engineer\ning and Design (FEED) work. \n Don Valley is also the only UK project to have been awarded funding - €180 million – under the EU’s European Energy Programme for Recovery.  \n \nTo date, jointly with National Grid Carbon as developer of the transportation and sal\nine storage option, approximately £100m has been invested in the project.  \nThe project was on track to be operational and providing 900MW of new-build, incremental low-carbon power in 2016.\nThe project was\n de-select\ned\n from the UK CCS Commercialisation Prog\nramme \nin October 2012\n but it\n had been ranked as the top project in Europe for\n funding under\n the NER300 programme\n and was ranked in the Top 10 projects globally by Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  The project is now being restructured so that it can be develo\nped outside, but parallel with, the UK commercialisation programme and intends to apply for a Final Investm\nent Decision (FID) enabling CfD so that it can make a Final Investment Decision at \nthe end of 2015.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;There are\n three basic carbon capture technologies for the power sector – capturing CO\n2\n either pre or post combustion of the fuel and the use of oxy-fuel turbines.  Each of these can be used with either coal or natural gas.  Each of the\nse\n technologies is ready to be deployed at scale today.  \nExperience of deployment of the technologies will be the best way to identify the areas that will benefit most from further research and development.\n&#xa0;\nFurther substantial volumes of CO\n2\n can be captured\n from energy intensive industrial sectors such as steel and cement.  Some sectors, such as gas processing and ammoni\na production, already separate \nand capture CO\n2\n as part of the industrial process and the additional costs\n represent very low cost CCS opport\nunities. \n 2Co looks for\nward to\n opportunities\n \nto be the offtaker of \nadditional \nvolumes of CO\n2\n such as this\n \nand to use them for EOR and storage.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAside from the environmental benefits of substantial reductions in CO\n2\n emissions, t\nhere are substantial potential benefits to the UK economy from the deployment of CCS technology:  CCS is not simply a cost\n.  CCS needs to be deployed widely around the world and although a few countries such as the USA and Canada are already proceeding with a small number of projects, the UK’s CfD mechanism offers \nboth \nsupport beyond single demonstration plants and the opport\nunity for the UK to \ngain advantages from being an early mover.   \n&#xa0;\nThe benefits of CCS range from the opportunity to build domestically and in international markets, a global leadership in the CCS industry, which if deployed extensively globally cold rival\n the oil and gas industry in the sale of investment involved.   The employment and trade benefits to the UK would be extensive.\n&#xa0;\nThe USA has used CO\n2\n for Enhanced Oil Recovery for more than 30 years and today some 6% of US oil production is produced this w\nay.  The UK’s North Sea oil industry has a large \nnumber of oil fields that are at a point in their life where the use of CO\n2\n for EOR and storage could significantly increase the proportion of oil that can be recovered.   If widely used, this technology cou\nld deliver billions of pounds of incremental tax revenue to The Treasury and extend the life of oil fields with all the associated employment and security of energy supply benefits that flow from that.  \n&#xa0;\nWork by the AEA has estimated benefits for UK-based\n firms to be £3-6.\n5bn per annum in the late 2020s but the case for CCS would be better understood and appreciated if there was a comprehensive analysis of the economic, fiscal and social benefits of CCS.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe principal barrier to the development of large-scale integrated CCS projects is the lack of the policy i\nncentives with sufficient long term certainty that will make what are multi-billion projects bankable.  The UK is addressing this with the creation of Contracts for Difference under the Electricity Market reform process.  However, EMR does not provided any\n clarity on longer term CCS objectives.  The draft Delivery Plan released in July includes scenarios which show anything from virtually no CCS projects through to a possible 12GW by 2030 whereas \ngreater clarity exists for \nrenewable technologies\n.\n \n  The\n lack\n of clarity\n around support for CCS also extends to a lack\n of guidance on a CfD price setting and allocation process for CCS projects. \n \n&#xa0;\nThe technologies needed for the construction and operation of large scale CCS projects - carbon capture, CO\n2\n transporta\ntion and storage – are all proven at scale in different industries around the world and do not require further development to be used in the first large scale CCS projects.  It is the integration of these technologies to create a new CCS industry that is n\novel.\n&#xa0;\nThe\n capturing, transporting and storage of CO\n2\n are all activities that are already carried out safely at scale in different industries around the world. \n \nThe \nEU \nCCS Directive, implemented by the UK, has already put in place the framework for the regulation of the industry.  The Directive may be\n review\ned and\n possibly revised as early as\n 2015. \nWhile there are concerns in the industry about \nonerou\ns and unpredictable liabilities \non CO\n2\n storage \nin saline formations in the EU, 2Co does not anticipate the issue causing the same concerns where the CO\n2\n is used \nfor Enhanced Oil Recovery and storage.  \n  \n \n&#xa0;\nThe majority of CCS projects\n that are making the most progress\n share at least three of four aspects of what is an emerging business model for early stage CSS projects:-\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA capital grant to assist with project development and possibly as a contribution to capital expenditure (examples include the EU (EEPR and NER300 pr\nogrammes), UK, Canada and USA).\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnhanced Oil Recovery \nto reduce the overall costs of CCS by offering low, or zero, cost CO\n2\n storage.  In some onshore situations, such as the USA, \nrather than acting as a cost to the project it is a commodity with a value \nand can be sold.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGovernment backed debt as an important source of funding and to reduce the costs of financing.  For instance, there have been Federal backed loans available in the USA and export credit agencies (such as Japanese and Chinese) are active.  \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA premium price for the cost of the low-carbon electricity that will support the operation of the plant.  The UK’s Contract for Difference\n is an example.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAs both the original plans for a CCS project at Peterhead and the UK government’s first CCS competition failed to lead to the construction of the UK’s first CCS large-scale CCS project, industry is wary.  \nThe current government has also scale\nd back its ambition for support for four projects to a maximum of two.  \nThe approach in the roadmap also seems to lack pace and scale.  \n&#xa0;\nThe Commercialisation Programme and work on follow-on projects need to move in parallel.  If there is a hiatus after t\nhe commercialisation programme, the opportunities afforded by early mover advantage will be lost, companies will dis-band CCS teams and move activity overseas and it will take the UK years to re-establish the skills and experience that have been nurtured t\no date.  In order to justify continued investment, the CCS industry needs a clear signal there will be a CCS market in the long term in the UK. \n&#xa0;\nIf project partners and investors are to be comfortable about committing additional funds in projects that are\n not part of the Commercialisation Programme, \nthey will quickly \nneed greater clarity around the process and timing of support under the CfD mechanism\n.\n  These projects need the EMR process to establish a predictable CCS CfD strike price setting and allocati\non process that offers a bankable CfD for CCS.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIf widespread deployment of CCS in the UK does not start now the costs of meeting UK \nemissions reduction targets w\nill be significantly higher than\n would otherwise be the case.  Delaying deployment of CCS until the 2020s or 2030s and trying to deploy CCS at a faster rate would stretch supply chains and drive up costs considerably.  \nGiven t\nhe technologies used in CCS are all proven at scale around the world, 2Co does not foresee CCS failing \ntechnically.\n  The company’s detailed estimates of costs also give 2Co confidence CCS is a cost competitive source of low-carbon power.  The \nprincipal ris\nk to the success of CCS is a lack of pace and scale in CCS policy and whether the CfD for CCS will be fit for purpose.\nFossil fuels \nstill account for the majority of power generated in the \nUK and \nare an important part of a robust and diverse electricity su\npply for the country.\n  \nCCS is the only way to secure the future of the UK’s coal mining and coal power industries and also the longer term future for the natural gas power generation industry while also meeting the UK’s legally binding emissions reduction \ntargets.  \nWith CCS\n,\n fossil fuels can fill an important role in meeting\n th\ne energy demands of a low-carbon future\n – both as baseload power and as flexible power to balance the intermittency of renewables\n.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
