&#xa0;Hi there,&#xa0;I live in Ravenglass in Cumbria and wish to bring to the notice of the &#xa0;committee the lack of train services &#xa0;to this communityin the early evening and none at all on a Sunday.&#xa0;It takes about 2 hours to travel from Ravenglass to Lancaster to then transfer to a major City train. &#xa0; The last train in the evening toRavenglass leaves Lancaster before 4.30pm.&#xa0;In the last 20 years I have only been able to book one return journey when taking holidays. &#xa0; &#xa0;Almost all of the time I am forced toto use my car instead of the train because of the limitations of the service provided.&#xa0;I have never use a bus in the county of Cumbria.&#xa0;Regards &#xa0; Brian Kennish&#xa0;&#xa0;
