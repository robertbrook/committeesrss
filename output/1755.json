"&#xa0;\nChristopher Ellison – Written evidence&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nI would ask you to consider including in the Bill measures to rid green lanes of recreational motors (off-road motorbikes and 4x4s) who use them for a challenge but to the determent of the overwhelming population and to the cost of the tax-payer who has to maintain the routes (which are fragile and easily damaged) and for Parliament to prevent the blight that stops many other peaceful users (walkers, cyclists and horse riders) from being able to enjoy the peace an tranquillity of green lanes.  I myself prefer to ride the lanes on my mountain bike and am saddened by the so many lanes I cannot or will not use for fear of meeting such screaming motor bikes or falling off on the deep ruts that they leave.\n&#xa0;\nThe Draft Bill already has a Rights of Way section and it would be very straightforward to include measures to re-define rights so that motors are only allowed on tarmac roads across the whole of \nEngland\n and \nWales\n.  In one stroke of the pen, a huge amount of money would be saved and the environment made better for all of us who use the countryside for peace and spiritual rejuvenation as well as for exercise and fitness.\n&#xa0;\nI understand that \nGreen Lane\n \nAlliance\n supporters across the country are calling for similar legislation and they will offer draft clauses that can be considered by the Committee to make it happen but while preserving private rights for householders from accidental extinguishment.\n&#xa0;\nOf course the small number of trail motorbikers and 4x4 will make a fuss about loosing rights however for the millions of peaceful users a fair balance has to be made; and of course the motorbikers could still experience the lanes but this time on foot, pedal-bike or horseback and in peace and quiet and little damage.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n29 August 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
