[normal]Jenny [bold]McEwan[bold], Professor of Criminal Law, Exeter University – Written [bold]e[bold]vidence[bold]Summary
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]All criminal justice systems entail a massive imbalance of power as between individual citizens and the state. Consequently, fairness demands that procedural protections, whether against oppressive behaviour by state officials or against simple error, are built into the system to prevent miscarriages of justice. This might be achieved by allowing defendants freedom to conduct their own case as they choose in conditions of transparency where legal challenge may be brought (as in the Anglo-American adversarial system) or via supervision of subordinate officers ‘ actions by higher-ranking officials within a hierarchical system (as in Continental Europe.) If either kind of safeguard is removed but not replaced with a different form of protective device, the dangers of unfairness and thus breach of Article 6, and of miscarriages of justice, become very serious
[normal].
[normal]Whilst the desire to make efficient use of court time is an entirely laudable objective, the possibility of information becoming lost within a less transparent, more managed, criminal process attaches to the implementation of Clauses 36-8. It is imperative that the Criminal Procedure Rules Committee is alert to the risks and drafts its provisions accordingly. It is not self-evident that the Court of Appeal, in its interpretation of the Rules, is currently giving the right to a fair trial the prominence it deserves. 
[normal]The ‘Stop Delaying Justice!’
[normal]  
[normal]initiative
[normal], which is designed  with magistrates’ courts in mind and is supported by HM Courts and Tribunals Service, most certainly does not
[normal]. Overall, the impact upon unrepresented defendants of the drive to manage time efficiently has not been given the 
[normal]attention
[normal] it warrants.
[normal]I would suggest that in a Utopian world where files contain the correct documents and where courts ensure that they are read with close attention, there may be little to fear from the proposals as they stand. However a) criminal justice systems must provide safeguards in case errors are made and b) the risks are high at present that errors will be made – see the various reports of HMCPS Inspectorate
[normal].
[normal]Clause 36
[normal]If s9 witness statements are not to be read out by or in front of the advocates/defendant, how is it to be ensured first, that all parties have the same statement in their files and secondly, that the Bench/jury have read them thoroughly and understood their contents?
[normal]Clause 37
[normal]If the documents (
[normal]eg
[normal] letters of mitigation) accompanying written pleas of guilty are not to be read out, how is it to be ensured first, that all parties have the same statement in their files and secondly, that the Bench/jury have read them and understood their contents? If the Bench is to consist of only one lay magistrate, sitting in a non-courtroom, how is to be ensured that the papers were correctly placed in file and have been duly considered before sentence is reached? Three people are more likely to notice mistakes than one. 
[normal]Clause 38
[normal]Electronic applications – again, make perfect sense – but only as long as unrepresented defendants who are not technologically literate are not penalised for the longer time it takes for other kinds of application to be made.
[normal]Conclusion
[normal]At present we are in danger of assuming that procedures which in a specific case have no apparent significance and appear to waste time are mere ‘rubber stamping’ and thus have no value in any kind of case. This will not always be
[normal] so.
