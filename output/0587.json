"Written evidence submitted by the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS) (EAS011)Declaration of interestsThis is the official submission from the Royal Astronomical Society to the Select Committee inquiry into the European and UK Space Agencies. The Society itself has no financial relationship with either the European Space Agency or the UK Space Agency. Many of our Fellows however are either employed by these organisations, receive grant funding from them or are involved with them in advisory roles.\nIntroductionExecutive summary&#xa0;\nWhat are the strengths and weaknesses of the funding, organisation, and work of the European Space Agency?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIn light of the European Commission’s recent Communication on relations between the ESA and EU (COM 2012 671), what relationship between ESA, the EU and the UK would provide the most effective governance regime? Why?&#xa0;\nHow effective is the EU’s support for research and innovation in the space sector? What effect have changes to the Multi-Annual Financial Framework had on ESA and support for the space sector from the Horizon 2020 programme?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow effective has the UK Space Agency been and what improvements could be made? Is the UK effectively exploiting opportunities for growth in the space sector or could more be done?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDoes the UK get good value for money from its membership of ESA? How does its return on investment compare to other countries?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow resilient is the UK’s space-based infrastructure? Are threats from space debris or solar activity being appropriately mitigated? What role do, or should, ESA and the UK Space Agency play in addressing these issues?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nApril 2013\n \nhttp://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/GES_Framework_final.pdf\n and \nhttp://www.nasa.gov/pdf/591067main_GER_2011_small_single.pdf\n \nhttp://www.europlanet-eu.org/\n \nhttp://www.astronet-eu.org/IMG/pdf/Astronet-Brochure_light.pdf\n \nEuropean Space Agency: Industrial Policy Committee: Geographical distribution of contracts (4 March 2013)\n \nSpace weather: impacts on engineered systems, infrastructure and society, \nhttp://tinyurl.com/burj2xy\n These events are well-documented in the scientific literature through the efforts of RAS Fellows and other scientists working at the time of those events.\n"
