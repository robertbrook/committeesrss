&#xa0;Home Affairs CommitteeOral evidence: The death of Mark Duggan,       HC 983Tuesday 14 January 2014Ordered by the House of Commons to be published on 14 January 2014.Watch the meeting Members present: Keith Vaz (Chair), Ian Austin, Nicola Blackwood, Mr James Clappison, Michael Ellis, Paul Flynn, Dr Julian Huppert, Mark Reckless, Mr David Winnick&#xa0;Questions 1-43Witness: 

[[[Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley]]], Metropolitan Police, gave evidence.  

[[[Q1 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] Can I call the Committee to order and refer all those present to the Register of Members’ Interests where the interests of members of this Committee are noted? Thank you, Assistant Commissioner Rowley, for coming before the Committee to give us a brief update as to the steps to be taken, if any, by the Metropolitan Police following the verdict in the Mark Duggan case. As you know, the Committee has produced quite a large report into the effects and causes of the riots two years ago. I understand you have a very brief statement you wish to read out.

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: I have a few notes. I was going to speak to you for three minutes or so, as we discussed, and then obviously we will have a debate about the issues. There are four issues that I think are worth picking up on the back of last week in terms of our thinking and where we go from now about the verdict and the rule of law, the continuing challenge of protecting Londoners from gun crime, how the Metropolitan Police can improve the engagement and trust of the public of London, and what we are doing with stop and search, a contentious tactic, and how we have improved and are continuing to improve that. First, briefly on the verdict and the rule of law. I think this is important because after three months of evidence and more than a week’s deliberations, 10 Londoners concluded that this was a case of a lawful killing. The jury system is a big part of British justice, a cornerstone one might say, and an ultimate form of accountability for citizens including police officers. We are a little concerned that some public figures have questioned the jury’s verdict and we believe the verdict should inspire confidence that the modern Met is professional, well trained, judicious in its use of force but ready to be held to account for its actions. The second point is about the continuing challenge going forward of protecting Londoners from the threat of gun crime. Our prime responsibility is of course to protect London’s 8.4 million people and make it the safest global city. Armed criminals have shot dead more than 50 people in London in the last three years or so. That is more than 50 families who have lost loved ones. Sometimes victims are not involved in gun criminality and sometimes particularly tragically, such as the murder of the 24-year-old mother Sabrina Moss last August. We believe the media should reflect more on this and make sure there is a balanced debate about the issues of tackling gun crime in London. Under this Commissioner we have increased the number of officers tackling gang crime and we want to continue to maintain that strength and those improvements that have secured 1,180 gang members now in prison or under judicial control and have resulted in the reduction of gun crime, stabbings and serious youth violence over the last two years by about a third. We shall continue to run specialist firearms operations confronting this threat, and you will have heard us talk about more than 3,000 operations and shots fired only in one or two of those incidents, demonstrating the professionalism of our officers. I think it is noteworthy that in the two or three days following the verdict last Wednesday we seized eight firearms in four operations, arresting eight people. Our assessment is that there is some indications that armed criminals chanced their luck and thought that we would be too timid to run firearms operations in the wake of the verdict. They were wrong and some will go to prison as a result, and we will continue to be equally determined. Public confidence in our tactics is critical and I issue an open invitation to the members of this Committee to visit our firearms range and look at our judgment training, see how we train officers and experience how difficult the split second decision is. The Commissioner asked me to extend his personal invitation to you as well. He thinks it would be very useful for you to go through that exercise, if you are going to scrutinise this issue.

[[[Chair:]]] Would you thank the Commissioner? We are happy to take up that offer.

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: That is very kind. Thank you.

[[[Q2 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] Can I begin with this question? Maybe you can come back to the rest of your statement later. Do you recognise the anger of the family in respect of the verdict and do you understand why they were so concerned?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: They wished for a different verdict and the decision of the jury, 10 ordinary Londoners, was that it was lawful killing. They were clearly hoping for much more strident criticism of the police, so they are upset at that. Regardless of the rights and wrongs of the case and different opinions, they lost a family member, so that grief of two and a half years earlier plays out again in that context, doesn’t it?

[[[Q3 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] But for the Met the verdict represents closure after what you describe as a three-month inquest, with lots of evidence being given to the jury. Members of this Committee had a look at some of the sessions. For the Metropolitan Police does this represent in effect the end as far as the Mark Duggan case is concerned, or is there still more to be done?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: There is still more to do. The jury made some comments about intelligence and the judge is looking at any recommendations that he might make. He sought representations from families and will consider those. He will ask us for a view and then he will come to some conclusions about any recommendations he wants to make, and we will take account of those of course. One of the other points I was going to make was about the wider issue of public confidence and engagement with the communities of London, even though the confidence of the public of London in the Metropolitan Police today is higher than it was immediately before the events of August 2011. That is important to remember. There is a lot of nonsense talked about levels of confidence. It is higher than it was, but there is still more to do in terms of engagement of the communities and we are determined to be stronger in that.

[[[Q4 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] On that, on 9 January the Commissioner said, “We do have a particular concern about our relationship with younger members of the black community”. This is something that maybe has been going on for some time. It is not new and specific to this case. Certainly in all the inquiries this Committee has conducted, commissioners and senior officers have said this. Is there a plan of action to try to win the confidence of young black members of the community in London?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: There are two points I was going to make. The first one is that there is particular contention about stop and search, which has always been a particularly sensitive tactic. On the one hand, I think all Londoners want us to use it as a tactic because they recognise that it is helpful in stopping young people or gang members using knives and guns and so on. On the other hand, people want it to be used as intelligently as possible and focused so that it is used against criminals and innocent people do not get caught in the use of the tactic. The Commissioner has personally been very committed to us changing the way we do stop and search. Over the last couple of years we have reduced it by over a third.

[[[Q5 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] Do you know when that will happen?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: Over the last two years we have reduced the use of stop and search by over a third already and we want to do more reduction of it, but we are arresting more people as a consequence of it because we are being more intelligent. So we are doing less of it, catching fewer innocent people by being overly broad in its use, but arresting more people as a consequence of using it. That is something we have been doing and we will continue to try to improve it. As an example, we have doubled our arrest rate on the back of stop and search.

[[[Q6 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] A number of the politicians in London have talked about the ethnicity of the Metropolitan Police. One way of restoring confidence is to make sure that the police look more like Londoners. We have asked this question many times over the last few years in this session, but figures obtained by Lord Ouseley suggest that there are only two black or Asian officers who are firearms officers in the Metropolitan Police, certainly when he put those questions down in 2010. Do you know whether that has improved in the last three and a half years?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: I can’t draw that number off the top of my head, but I am confident that it is higher than that. 

[[[Q7 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] Would you let us have those figures?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: I can let you have those figures. Of course I can.

[[[Q8 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] In respect of what the judge said about the note-taking by the officers, his concern that perhaps notes had been swapped by officers involved in this case, it reminds us very much of what we heard in previous cases, both in the Andrew Mitchell case and in Hillsborough. Are you looking into the comments of the judge as a result of your follow-up to the verdict?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: We have already made changes over the last two years. If one looked at the handling of note-taking immediately after Woolwich, it was supervised and managed in a very different way that would have stood the scrutiny that this case had in a much better way. I think it is important to remember that officers are witnesses not criminal suspects and they should be treated as such after such an incident, but of course as they sit down, in a state of shock frankly, having been involved in such an incident, they do need to be supervised and that process needs to be managed in a way that stands scrutiny and does not allow people to infer that anything inappropriate took place. Clearly in this case the jury did not think it had, otherwise I am sure they would have come to a different conclusion.

[[[Q9 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] Do you know when the pilot about body cameras that the Commissioner promised is going to start? This seems to be one of the ways in which different versions of events can be put into the public domain in an open way. Do we have a start date for body cameras?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: We will be testing it by April.

[[[Q10 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] By April of this year a pilot will begin in the Metropolitan Police area with body cameras for police officers?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: For some firearms operations, yes. We are doing some other testing across other types of endeavour as well. We have some loose tests at the moment. In one borough a lot of stop and searches have been recorded, so it is being used in other contexts. I want to stress our commitment to it to this Committee. It is not a pilot, “Do we fancy using it in the long term or don’t we?” The first stage to test the pilot is simply a proof of concept in terms of what is the right equipment, how do we use the equipment, what are the logistics of someone who is carrying so much kit, before we roll it out more widely. We are very committed to it.

[[[Q11 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Michael Ellis:]]] Assistant Commissioner, for my part I want to start by thanking you, and your officers through you, for keeping the streets of London safe. You spoke about maintaining public confidence and I respect the work that your officers do. I have two questions for you, one particularly in relation to the verdict of lawful killing in respect of the day in court. At that time there are reports that the jury as they were leaving were threatened and there was conduct towards the jury that was below the standards we would normally expect. Was that a failure of policing for that court hearing and will you be looking at that as far as security is concerned?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: I was in court at the time. There was a lot of anguish and upset that was then replicated outside the court. There is clearly a judgment to be made between is that anger or upset that is a human reaction to a verdict or does that overspill into inappropriate threatening behaviour towards a jury. A judge is all powerful in his court. If the judge decides it is contempt, he has the powers to deal with it. If he asks the Metropolitan Police for assistance in gathering evidence of course we will assist him, but it is for his discretion not mine whether to intervene. If I had leapt forward and intervened I think I would have some other questions from this Committee.

[[[Q12 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Michael Ellis:]]] Did you feel that the jury had been threatened or intimidated in that incident?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: I think the intensity of the emotion was of concern to some of them. I will leave it to the judge to decide whether that merits sanction or intervention.&#xa0;

[[[Q13 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Michael Ellis:]]] With reference to the judge, or the coroner as he was, he is reported as having proposed that the family should be consulted for their views in respect of the training of firearms officers. Do you have any objections to that consultation taking place? Is there any reason why that should not happen?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: I am open to anybody who has any better ideas on how we can do our work. The natural course in an inquest is that a coroner can make recommendations if he or she sees things that can be improved on the back of the learning of that process. The sensible process he has adopted in this case is that, given those recommendations are likely to focus on the police, he has asked all the other parties if there are any observations they would make. He will then consider them and any he thinks have some merit he will ask us for a view on. He will then balance those to give a report.

[[[Q14 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Michael Ellis:]]] As far as you are concerned, you are open minded about that and you see no objection? I can’t see any objections to why the family ought not to be involved.

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: Better ideas are always welcome.

[[[Q15 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Mark Reckless:]]] Assistant Commissioner, are you saying that it can only be a matter for the coroner to determine whether there has been a contempt of court and that there is no legal possibility of a prosecution or police involvement in terms of a threat to kill if it is made in a courtroom?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: I spoke to the head of legal services at the Metropolitan Police about this issue and his advice to me was that it needs to be left with the judge to make a decision and then I will support him if he asks me to.

[[[Q16 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Mark Reckless:]]] The courtroom is one thing, but to the extent that such allegedly threatening conduct spills out of the courtroom, is that then a matter for the police rather than the coroner?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: It certainly is and you will have seen my attempt at a public statement afterwards, which was one of the more unusual press briefings I have done. I don’t think I have done one under the sort of hail of spittle and abuse that I faced on that occasion. I would emphasise that the family and their close associates had left by that stage. I would not have gone out with the family there because that would have been provocative. It was other protestors who had latched on to the issue who behaved in that way. There was one incident of missile throwing that we will look at, like we would do at any other protest, so that will be followed up. As I said, in the court if the judge wants us to pick issues up then we will do.

[[[Q17 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Mark Reckless:]]] Given the history of Tottenham and the riots and how they spread from there, I think everyone would understand caution on the part of the police and emphasis on maintaining order and not risking further disorder, but nonetheless is there not also a requirement to be seen to uphold the law? It is difficult for you personally, and perhaps you are not the person to make the judgment for the Metropolitan Police on this, but if people see on their TV screens an officer being spat at, let alone the missile you referred to, and no action taken, doesn’t that bring the law and the police enforcement potentially in disrepute?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: The missile issue will be followed up.

[[[Q18 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Mark Reckless:]]] And the spitting at an officer in respect of a senior officer?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: The shouting and spitting and things we left as it was. I am not going to try to follow up every minor offence that went on. I was the prime victim of that. I was doing my duty, facing some abuse that in the heat of the moment we can let go, but throwing missiles we can’t let go.

[[[Q19 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Mark Reckless:]]] In terms of what happened in Tottenham on the Saturday night that led to the riots, is the police investigation into those incidents and consideration of exactly who was involved now complete?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: It is just wrapping up. It is a little shy of 5,000 arrests. I was talking to the detective superintendent who is running it the other day. I think we have made 4,900-and-something arrests and it is over 3,000 convictions, if my memory serves me correctly.

[[[Q20 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Mark Reckless:]]] I will leave that question there. If I may ask you one final question about the welfare of the officer concerned who shot and killed an individual. What is the Metropolitan Police doing to look after his welfare? There has been a verdict of lawful killing. Will that allow him to come to terms and move on, in terms of overall policy? Of course there must be privacy for the individual.

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: There are some comments I can make on overall policy and on this particular case, which is unusual.

[[[Mark Reckless:]]] Yes, that is sufficient.

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: The overall policy is that normally the IPCC investigation will be advanced two or three months after an incident such as a shooting. If they are telling us that they have no evidence of any misconduct or criminality concerns on behalf of the officer then it is likely at that stage we will start what we call the post-shooting support programme, which is a course of welfare, training and issues to work the officer back to returning to firearms duties, if he or she wishes. It may be with the shock of the incident they say they do not want to do it again, and that is perfectly understandable. That is the normal course of events. Even though in this case that could have applied because the IPCC have always said to us that there was no evidence of misconduct or criminality, because of the high levels of public interest and concern and all the issues that followed in 2011, the three principal officers—the overall firearms commander, the tactical commander and the principal officer—have all stayed out of firearms duties for that period. We have now made the decision after the verdict that, given that the jury were very clear about his decision-making being lawful and the planning of the operation, we should start the return programme. So it is a programme that in due course will lead to that.

[[[Q21 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] I think either you or the Commissioner said that you were going to meet the family. Has that happened? Have you gone to meet the family, either individually or through representatives, or is that something that is not going to happen?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: We have offered that and we continue to offer it. They are not keen on it at the moment. They might take it up at some point in the future. It is a matter for them.

[[[Q22 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] But the Commissioner has offered to meet them to talk about this case?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: Yes, as I have.&#xa0;

[[[Q23 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Mr Winnick:]]] Given that the jury came to the decision that it did that it was a lawful killing, is it the position that there are no further lessons as far as the Met is concerned over what happened in the killing of Mark Duggan?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: No, not at all. I think professionalism demands that every operation, however well it goes or badly it goes, should be looked at for learning lessons. We have mentioned some of the handling afterwards, such as the post-incident procedure. We have looked at some of the issues like body cameras and how that would help. We have been looking at whether there are any tactical improvements we can make on enforced stops, and we can’t see any at the moment. Then there are the comments made on the intelligence and preliminary work done before the case where the jury were critical, where there may be opportunities there, and we want to see what more the judge has to say and then we will look for lessons.

[[[Q24 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Mr Winnick:]]] Do you accept that despite the decision of the jury—and I am certainly not going to second guess that decision—nevertheless there is bound to be continued controversy over the actual circumstances that led to Mr Duggan’s death?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: I am not sure about that. I think the controversy arises because we have had two and a half years of rumour, innuendo and mischief, and you can read a million and one theories on the internet. That has played out. The Metropolitan Police and the IPCC have said that we both made mistakes early on not doing enough public communication in August 2011, so we didn’t help that. Lots of other factors have played into it. I think it is that rumour and innuendo that then causes some consternation about the verdict of the jury, who of course have considered three months of evidence. I think it is that tension that we see playing out.

[[[Q25 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Mr Winnick:]]] The Chair asked if you were intending to meet the Duggan family. Is it not a possibility, to say the least, that the reluctance of the Duggan family arises from the lack of communication that occurred when Mark Duggan was killed?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: I would make two points. Firstly, a senior officer did meet them a few months after the event to apologise for that poor handling. Commander Mak Chishty met them.

[[[Q26 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Mr Winnick:]]] A few months afterwards?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: Yes. In these incidents we hand over investigative responsibility to the IPCC as soon as possible. In that handover, collectively between the two of us, we made mistakes in communication with the family. That is a matter of regret and we have said that publicly before.

[[[Q27 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Mr Winnick:]]] There have been endless stories in the press that Mark Duggan was a notorious criminal and the rest of it. He may have been, he may not have been. As a member of this Committee or as a Member of the House of Commons, I couldn’t possibly know any more than my colleagues about Mr Duggan’s lifestyle. What I want to ask you, Assistant Commissioner, is simply have some of those stories that have appeared in the media come from the Met?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: Over the course of the trial there was an exploration of the intelligence and the history of Mark Duggan that led to the firearms operation and the material that we had in terms of our history of him, things he had been suspected of, serious offences he had been arrested for. That background of intelligence, which of course influenced the operation, was presented as evidence in the court case. So to that degree, yes.

[[[Q28 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Mr Clappison:]]] Very briefly and without going into any of the issues about Mark Duggan—and I believe there was an issue about gang membership, which I don’t want to go into in any way, shape or form—you raised the question of gangs in your opening statement to us and you mentioned a figure of I think 50 deaths as a result of gun crime in London in the last three years. How many of those related to gangs?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: More than half of shootings in London are down to gang members.

[[[Q29 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Mr Clappison:]]] Is the picture with gangs getting better or worse? Are there more or fewer gangs?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: We have 250 gangs in London. Over 150 of them are criminally active; about 50 or so are seriously criminally active. As I said, we are in the process of tackling them. We have reduced the number of stabbings and shootings by about a third over the last two years as a consequence of our initiative and we have increased to over 1,000, as I said, the number of gang members who are either in prison or under judicial control with issues like gang injunctions.

[[[Q30 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Ian Austin:]]] Obviously the Met have been determined to handle the aftermath of the inquest sensitively and prevent any sort of disturbances, as happened after the shooting. I think you have done that brilliantly, but I do think it is important that when people talk about wider lessons, in the end this had nothing to do with stop and search. Given that no one knows anything at all, so far as I am aware, about the identity let alone the ethnicity of the officers involved in the operation, it has nothing to do with the ethnicity of the Metropolitan Police either. It has nothing to do with those wider concerns. What happened here was that if someone runs round London with a gun, that is a dangerous thing to do. There was an operation to deal with that and we can all see what happened. Would you agree with me that it is important that all of us, the Met included, point out that it is in the interests of the diverse and poorest communities in London that the people involved in these sorts of activities are investigated and dealt with? It is the poorest and most diverse communities who are the victims of these gangsters. Isn’t that also worth pointing out?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: I think that is absolutely true. Groups who pressurise the police to be tackling crime in their communities in London would agree with that. On the one hand, on the narrowest interpretation, this was about tackling gang and gun crime in London, no more, no less, but of course in all the surrounding factors of disorder and trust and confidence, there is a long history of 30 or 40 years of police relations with minority communities, not all of it great, and we have to be honest about that. That long history is a backdrop to these issues. Even though this was an operation against a gang member regardless of creed or colour, the backdrop is significant. Our ability to police communities sensitively, to use stop and search intelligently and not to be disproportionate in how we use it, to increase the make-up of our organisation to be more reflective of London, is all relevant to overall trust and confidence. But this was, as you say, an operation against gang crime.

[[[Q31 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Nicola Blackwood:]]] I wanted to pick up on a couple of the lessons learned comments that you made to Mr Winnick, particularly on the intelligence gathering finding of the inquest in which the jury unanimously found that they did not think that you had done everything that you could have done between midday on 3 August and 6.00pm on 4 August to gather and react to intelligence about the possibility of Mr Duggan collecting a gun from Mr Hutchinson-Foster. Why do you think they came to that conclusion?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: I have read their comments and I am still working my way through what they meant and I am looking forward to the judge colouring that in and widening it out in his conclusions. I think they have made two comments, as I have understood them, and I am nervous about giving the wrong interpretation. There is a narrow piece where they say they do not have enough information about the immediate intelligence that led to the operation. There was some sensitivities about the intelligence and its sources and that was kept from them, so that is not surprising. The more challenging comment they make is that Kevin Hutchinson-Foster, the guy who supplied the weapon, was wanted for a separate offence at that time, and they are challenging us as to whether we had done enough to locate him and arrest him for that offence, which then may of course have stopped this chain of events. I think that is the challenge they are making to us. I think the judge will colour in some issues around that on the basis of their two brief comments.

[[[Q32 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Nicola Blackwood:]]] What sort of chain of events have you put in place to react to this finding and try to make sure that you are ready to respond to future similar events?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: I have senior colleagues tasked with looking at what more we can do to be better at finding wanted offenders. Through our performance meetings, we do monitor the number of wanted offenders across London for serious offences and how good we are at tracking them down. People wanted for serious gun crime, such as Kevin Hutchinson-Foster, the supplier of the weapon, don’t have one address. You can’t knock on the door at 8.00am and regularly find them, so it is not easy but we can always do better at having fewer of them wanted and missing.

[[[Q33 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Nicola Blackwood:]]] Okay, but you have a specific group of people looking at the outcomes of this particular finding?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: Yes.

[[[Q34 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Nicola Blackwood:]]] How many people do you have doing that?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: I have tasked a senior officer with looking at it. He sat down with some people yesterday. I don’t know what team he has put around him yet.

[[[Q35 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Nicola Blackwood:]]] Thank you. The second point was to move on to the IPCC report, which has already come out, regarding the communications with the family, and you have alluded to this a number of times. There are recommendations that we made in our report as well about the need to maybe update the guidance about communications with families following deaths related to police operations. What actions have you taken already in order to make sure that such an incident might not happen again?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: I think it is a more a matter of style and determination than it is about guidance, frankly. There is always going to be a boundary between the police dealing with the scene at the incident and very eagerly getting the IPCC in to pick it up as a body. They are a small organisation and that will take time. What you saw in 2011 was a hesitance on both sides in managing that boundary. What you would see today is that regardless of the niceties the important thing is, whoever it is going to be, somebody needs to talk to the family as quickly as possible, and we would certainly do that rather than stand on ceremony and make a mess of it.

[[[Q36 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Nicola Blackwood:]]] Do you think that one of the reasons why there was a failure to engage with the Duggan family was a particular fear because of the history of community relations in this area and not wanting to get it wrong?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: There are several factors behind it, such as a complicated extended family, unnecessary hesitance on our part, the nature of the circumstances of a police shooting. There are lots of factors that play into it. I am nervous about going too far into that because it sounds like I am offering excuses. I don’t mean to. We didn’t do it as well as we should do and we should do better next time.

[[[Q37 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Nicola Blackwood:]]] Are you going to offer training about family relations, more training? What sort of action are you going to take to change the culture and these problems that you have identified?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: All of our commanders are aware of the learning lessons of this issue and it is really for the commanders on the operation in question to make sure that is a high priority. It is not going to be a decision made by a DC at the scene. It is going to be the commanders. We put a big command structure around an operation like this and senior officers such as myself are responsible for making sure we do that as quickly as possible.

[[[Q38 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] The Commissioner said on 9 January, “We need to do more, much more, to improve our relationship with black Londoners”. You have given us some practical steps as to what you would have done differently as opposed to what happened two and a half years ago. It is a bold statement but there is no practicalities behind it. How do you go out and talk to black Londoners and do different things to what you have done before, because you need to regain that trust, don’t you?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: I think “regain” is overstating it, but we would agree that we always want to do better. There is always some way to go. We are looking at specifics in terms of Tottenham: what can we do differently? I know the Commissioner is personally committed to it and if he can help that by being personally involved then I know he will do. We have multiple community groups. We have community groups looking at stop and search records. We invite them to the police station. The Borough Commander at Tottenham, Victor Olisa, invites young people from the area to set his diary for a day so they can show him what the world looks like from their perspective. We are up for any ideas from community leaders and that was why the Commissioner had that meeting with community leaders and with elected representatives on Thursday morning last week immediately after the verdict. We always planned to do that regardless of the verdict. Across London, the Commissioner is looking to appoint a very senior officer to be dedicated to leading on community engagement and making a step change in our approach.

[[[Q39 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] Do you know when that will be? 

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: He hopes to make a decision this week.

[[[Q40 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] This week he will be appointing a senior officer specifically to deal with community relations?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: Yes.

[[[Q41 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] Just in terms of what happened last week, you seemed very well prepared for the possibility of disorder. How many officers were on standby?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: I think this is really important, because disorder issues were a big part of the learning of 2011. You saw our report 4 Days in August. I would describe Saturday as a community policing operation, discreet, careful, sensitive, given the family wanted to hold a vigil, surrounded by a large public order contingency. As we approached the weekend, I had two streams of intelligence that concerned me. One was of multiple extreme left-wing protest groups looking to take part in the vigil, and some of those had previously been associated with disorder. Secondly, there was intelligence of local criminal youth, gang members and so on, expressing a desire to prompt disorder. It is hard to tell whether that was bravado or substance but one can’t take the chance. So there were two streams that gave me some concern. We had of the order of 1,300 public order trained police officers to hand. They were discreet, they were out of the way, and as it was they were never seen. We were very clear with the organisers, who did an excellent job at running a sensitive event, that if we had to intervene of course we would but until that point we wanted to be discreet and let them run what should be a dignified event.

[[[Q42 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] Is it your concern that this campaign, which is presumably going to go on on the part of the family, may well be being taken over by groups not associated with the issues that are behind their campaign? I think David Lammy referred to anarchist groups and other groups that might be taking over.

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: There are all sorts of extreme left-wing groups associating themselves with the cause, and I guess it is a matter for the family whether they want that or not, to some degree. Protestors, fine, and whoever wants to join, that is obviously equally fine. It is not for me as a police officer to judge. I am concerned that within some of those groups there are elements that do have a tendency to cause disorder on certain occasions.

[[[Q43 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] But you are ready for a dialogue with the family?

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: Yes, absolutely, of course.

[[[Chair:]]] Assistant Commissioner, thank you very much for coming and please keep us informed of issues you think are relevant to our Committee.

[[[Assistant Commissioner Rowley]]]: Thank you for the opportunity.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;              Oral evidence: The death of Mark Duggan, HC 983                            11
