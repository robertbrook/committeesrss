default1.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRoyal Mail is pleased to respond to the Select Committee for Business, Innovation and Skills on its short inquiry into 
defaultthe 
defaultGovernment’s 
defaultintention to conduct a sale of shares in Royal Mail
default.
default 
defaultThe Government’s intention
default is to dispose of a majority stake, taking into account shares sold and those transferred to employees as part of the employee share scheme.
default 
defaultThe Government will retain flexibility around the size of stake to be sold, as this will be influenced by market co
defaultnditions at the time of the transaction, investor demand and the objective to ensure that overall value for money for the taxpayer is achieved. 
defaultRoyal Mail welcome
defaults the Government’s
default decision. The company needs to be 
defaultflexible, responsive,
default 
defaultand have future acc
defaultess to 
defaultcapital.
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRoyal Mail is also pleased that
default the Government has decided to allocate 10% of the
default shares
default in
default the company to
default all eligible employees
default free of charge. Employees of the Group will have a real stake in the company and a significant voice
default in its future
default.
default This is the largest 
defaultfree stake of any major UK privatisation
default.
default More employees will be able to participate in the
default Royal Mail
default Free Share scheme than in any other UK privatisation for almost 30 years.
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRoyal Mail is the sole provider of the 
defaultUniversal
default Postal
default Service in the UK, serving more than 29 million addresses, 6 days a week. Our Universal Service obligations are outlined in th
defaulte Postal Services Act 2011. They are 
defaultset out in detail in the Universal Service Order. This statutory document is
default set and regulated by the 
defaultcommunications regulator Ofcom
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs the Universal Service provider, Royal Mail has a legal obligation to provide a uniform-priced Universal Service across the UK
default, including remote and rural areas
default. 
defaultW
defaulte
default maintain a 
defaultsubstantial 
defaultnetwork
default across the UK – a network with the ability to deliver to every household and collect from every collection point, six days a week
default.
default  Any change to this obligation would require an affirmative vote in both Houses of Parliament.
default&#xa0;
default1.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPost Office Ltd has been 
defaultformally separated from Royal Mail Group since April 201
default2
default. We
default continue
default as sister companie
defaults
default with 
defaultsubstantial
default shared interests
default. Post Office 
defaultis an important retail outlet for
default Royal Mail services under a long term commercial 
defaultdistribution 
defaultagreement.
default The mutual 
defaultcommercial success of both companies is best served by Royal Mail and Post Office working closely together for the benefit of 
defaultcustomers. 
defaultA successful, com
defaultmercially viable Royal Mail can
default generate more business for the Post Office and help secure its nationw
defaultide network of branches.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default2.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn December 2008, Richard Hooper published an independent report into
default the UK postal services sector. His report 
defaultoutlined steps to make 
defaultthe Universal Service sustainable. Hooper made four 
defaultkey 
defaultpolicy recommendations:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default2.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHooper made clear that his “recommendations are a package…Each element of the package is needed if the universal service is to be sustained.”
default 
defaultHooper updated his review in the sum
defaultmer of 2010. His update argued that “private sector capital would inject private sector disciplines into the company and would reduce the risk of political intervention in commercial decisions, thus accelerating modernisation.” Hooper also considered alter
defaultnative not-for-profit and not-for-dividend models, but concluded that these would not be 
default“
defaultappropriate or workable.
default”
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Government facilitated 
defaultthe 
defaultimplementation of Hooper’s recommendations through the Postal Services Act 2011. 
defaultThis
default allowed 
defaultthe 
defaulttransfer
default of
default 
defaultthe Group’s 
defaultpension 
defaultliabilities for pre-April 2012 service and certain pension assets relating to the Royal Mail Pension Plan
default,
default to 
defaultGovernment. The Government also 
defaultappoint
defaulted
default Ofcom as the new postal services regulator. Ofcom has since reformed the regulat
defaultory framework for postal services in the UK.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe Government aims to complete 
defaultthe 
defaultimplementation of Hooper’s package of reforms through a sale of shares in Royal Mail in this financial year.
default The Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills has sai
defaultd that “now the time has come for Government to step back from Royal Mail and allow its management to focus wholeheartedly on growing the business and planning for the future.”
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPrivatisa
defaulttion will give Royal Mail flexible
default access to private capital. This 
defaultwill
default be a positive step for Royal Mail and the Universal Service.
default Royal Mail wants to combine the best of the public and private sectors.
default 
defaultFor Royal Mail to innovate and 
defaultremain competitive in the marketplace
default,
default it
default need
defaults to continue its
default transformation. 
defaultDeutsch
defaulte Post has invested more than £20bn in its business since it was floated in 2001 whilst delivering one of the highest quality universal services in Europe. In comparison, since Royal Mail began its modernisation programme in 2006/7, it has invested c.£2.8b
defaultn on modernisation. 
defaultRoyal Mail needs to increase revenue from the growing parcels market. This is 
defaulta 
defaultcompetitive
default market
default and investment in new technology will be crucial. 
defaultHaving 
defaultflexible
default 
defaultaccess to 
defaultcapital would help to deliver our long term strategy, leading
default to a sustainable Universal Service.

defaultThe Universal Servicedefault&#xa0;default3.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRoyal Mail is the designated provider of the universal postal service, committed to providing the high quality U
defaultniversal 
defaultS
defaultervice
default that the Government
default and regulator have
default set down. We ar
defaulte honoured to provide the universal service.
default Royal Mail Group’s strategic vision is to be recognised as the best delivery company in the UK.
default We believe that the nationwide network we maintain in order to deliver the Universal Service puts us in a strong position to compete and meet emerging customer demand. 
defaultT
defaulthe ability to visit every address in the UK, six days a week
default provides commercial advan
defaulttages to Royal Mail
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Postal Services Act 2011 protects the high-quality Universal Service
default enjoyed by customers across the UK
default. Its protections would continue to apply following any sale of shares
default in Royal Mail
default. The protections include a uniform service
default to rural areas, to which Royal Mail must continue to deliver the same high-quality service or risk large fines.  It also protects specific services, such as the Articles for the Blind scheme, which provides free postal services to blind or partially sight
defaulted people.
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Postal Services Act 2011 sets down the minimum requirements of the universal postal service in law. These minimum requirements include the collection of letters every Monday to Saturday and a delivery service at affordable prices in accorda
defaultnce with a uniform tariff throughout the UK.  The requirements are set out 
defaultin S
defaultection 31 of the Postal Services Act 2011.  Any change to these minimum requirements would require the approval of both houses of the UK Parliament. The requirements are:

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFirst and Second Class stamped and franked mail, and Royal Mail First and Second Class parcels to 20kg, are part of the Universal Service.  That means they have to be offered on a universal (“one-price-goes-anywhere”) tariff at affordable prices.  Ofcom ha
defaultve recently concluded that these services meet the needs of the vast majority of postal users and there is no case for changing the terms of the Universal Service (Ofcom Review of postal users’ needs, 27 March 2013). 
default&#xa0;
defaultPricesdefault&#xa0;
default3.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn 2012, Ofcom said that Roya
defaultl Mail’s fi
defaultnancial position meant there was
default 
default“
defaulta risk to the financial sustainability of the Universal Service”. Ofcom recognised the need for Royal Mail “to materially increase prices in order to support the sustainability of the universal service.” 
defaultRoyal 
defaultMail increased stamp prices in April 2012 to help to address the threat to the sustainability of the Universal Service.
default Royal Mail also reconfigured its parcels tariffs in 2013
default. 
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultStamp prices, whether set under public or private ownership, are subject to 
defaultsignificant competitive pressures. Customers have many alternatives to the post. 
defaultOfcom have reported that more than 
default37 billion te
defaultx
defaultt messages were sent in 2012
default. 
defaultMore than half of adults own a smart phone, 
defaultand 49% regularly use smart phones to access the int
defaulternet
default [Ofcom Communication Markets Report, August 2013]
default. 
defaultHouseholds and businesses increasingly use e-mail to communicate in preference to post. 
defaultThese are just a few examples of the proliferation of alternatives to the post, which naturally mean that Royal
default Mail must be cautious in its pricing and customer strategies.
default&#xa0;
default3.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUK stamp prices are among the best value in the EU. In five of the six weight steps for First Class and Second Class mail, the cost of UK stamps are ranked in the bottom half of prices when 
defaultcompared with other EU countries. In some cases, the UK is the cheapest.
default&#xa0;
default3.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOfcom is legally obliged to ensure an affordable postal service and can reintroduce regulation on any Universal Service product. Ofcom concluded in March 2013 that Royal Mail’s servi
defaultces were affordable to consumers and small and medium sized businesses.
default Ofcom said (in their report on the affordability of postal services, published 19 March 2013):
default&#xa0;
default“The evidence we have collected indicates that universal postal services are affordable 
defaultfor both residential consumers (including low income and other vulnerable consumers) and businesses (including small and medium businesses) at current prices. We have reviewed the price changes that are due to take effect from 2 April 2013 (as announced by
default Royal Mail in March 2013), and consider that universal postal services will continue to be affordable following these changes.”
default&#xa0;
default3.9
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn 2013 there was no increase in the price of first class or second class stamps for letters. Ofcom has also set safeguard pri
defaultce caps on Second Class stamped mail in 2012, which also covers Second Class parcels up to 2kg. The cap
default calculation
default is set for seven years (from April 2012). 
default&#xa0;
defaultQuality of servicedefault&#xa0;
default3.10
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRoyal Mail is regulated by Ofcom.  The regulator sets a minimum delivery 
defaultstandard for the whole of the UK.  Currently the target for First Class mail is 93% delivery the next working day.  For Second Class mail the target is 98.5% delivery within three working days. Royal Mail has amongst the highest service specifications of a
defaultny major EU member

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.11
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRoyal Mail’s Quality of Service report for 2012/13 reveals that the vast majority of mail was delivered in 
defaultline with its targets. Royal Mail narrowly missed the 93.0 per 
defaultcent First Class mail target with 92.4 per cent of this mail delivered the next working day, when taking into account disruption from external events.
default&#xa0;
default3.12
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn a very competitive market, Quality of Service is one of the key drivers of success. That would not change if Royal Mail were 
defaultprivatised
default. The Quality of Service regime that applies to Royal Mail under public ownership will continue to apply under private
default ownership - Ofcom has specified the minimum standards un
defaultder the Universal Service Order
default.
default We are the only postal operator in the UK who has to meet these high standards and regularly publish performance results.
default&#xa0;
default3.13
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEvidence from elsewhere in Europe shows tha
defaultt postal operators maintain or improve their quality of service following privatisation.
default Both Deutsche Post and Austria
default Post deliver more than 95% of letters the day after posting. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default4.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOver the past decade, the postal services sector has changed 
defaultdramatically
default.
default A decline in mail volumes has coincided with the liberalisation of the market and the emergence of competition. In recent
default years, we have seen a significant
default increase in the number of parcels being sent. All of this has meant a difficult proces
defaults of change for our people. Many of Royal Mail’s employees have seen changes to their working practices as the company 
defaulthas adapted its operations
default to the changed mix of mail. 
defaultMore than 50,000 people have left the business since March 2003.
default 
defaultChange will conti
defaultnue and the company will 
defaultemploy fewer people in the future,
default whoever owns it. The company remains committed to the overarching objective of achieving this without compulsory redundancies.

defaultRoyal Mail Group
default’s
default vision 
defaultis 
defaultto be 
defaultrecognised as 
defaultthe most successful
default delivery company in the UK. Our strategy is underpinned by three priorities: capitalising on growth in online retailing to grow our parcels businesses; continuing to m
defaultanage
default structural decline in the letters market by maximising the value of mail; and by being customer-focused. We believe we can drive sustainable, profitable growth that will enable us to obtain ongoing access to external capital and secure a sustainable futur
defaulte for our Company. 
defaultThe company will need to be smaller and more efficient in the future regardless of ownership.
default Delivering this strategy will require significant change. We will consult on any changes with the CWU, Unite, and our people.
default&#xa0;
defaultEmployee terms adefaultnd conditionsdefault&#xa0;
default4.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAll terms and conditions and collective agreements that apply to employees would remain in place were there to be a change in ownership of the company, on the same basis that they apply to employees now. Royal Mail will continue to have a pr
defaultedominantly full time workforce, supported by part time workers, with a national split of around 75% full time workers to 25% part time. 
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThese 
defaultjob security
default, and other, commitments are part of current agreements with the Communication Workers Union. If 
defaultand when any changes are proposed, Royal Mail will, as now,
default 
defaultand where appropriate, discuss these with the unions with a view to reaching agreement.
default&#xa0;
default4.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe have proposed a three year agreement with the CWU, protecting terms and conditions and committing to sig
defaultnificant pay rises
default for employees in the core business
default. The agreement would include a pay increase of 8.6% over the three year period. This is highly competitive, and is believed to be one of the best pay deals on offer from any major UK company at this tim
defaulte.
default&#xa0;
default4.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRoyal Mail is 
defaultalso 
defaultseeking to create a legally binding and enforceable contract with the CWU. The proposed contract would mean pay and protections for employees could not be changed for the three-year period of the contract without CWU agreement. Royal
default Mail believes 
defaultthat this has not been done before for any major 
defaultUK 
defaultprivatisation
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn addition, as part of the proposed agreement, Royal Mail is committed to provide and enhance existing services to customers using the current workforce and there will be n
defaulto change to the current structure of 
defaultthe 
defaultcompany in relation to these services.
default&#xa0;
default No additional outsourcing of services is expected during the period of the agreement.
default&#xa0;
defaultEmployee sharesdefault&#xa0;
default4.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Government has said that it intends to give 10% of the shares in 
defaultRoyal Mail to eligible employees free of charge at the time of the Initial Public Offering. This will be the biggest free share offer of any major privatisation for almost 30 years.

defaultRoyal Mail welcomes the Government’s decision on free share allocation. Eligible employees will automatically have a meaningful stake in the company and the potential to benefit from its future success. 
defaultAcademic studies have shown that 
defaultmost
default UK employees who engaged with their employee share ownership plan were more motivated and committed to their employer
default, and many
default 
defaultfelt that participating in an ESO gave them a greater sense of personal ownership for their job or a greater sense of personal ownership for the company. 
default(
defaultLoughborough University four-year study into the human impact of HMRC-approved all-employee share pla
defaultns, 2012).
default&#xa0;
default4.10
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultShares will be allocated 
defaultto all eligible staff equally, reg
defaultardless of grade or pay levels
default. The allocation will be pro-rated based on an employee’s paid hours to differentiate between full and part time workers. 
default&#xa0;
default4.11
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEmployees will be able to see t
defaulthe value of their shares any time that the stock market is open. They will also be able to vote in key decisions on how the company is run. The company will use this opportunity to engage
default with employees even more, as well as actively communicating the bene
defaultfits of free shares
default. We will conduct major internal communications programmes around the company’s results and commercial strategy. 
default&#xa0;
default4.12
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe overwhelming majority of Royal Mail Group employees in the UK, including employees working in Parcelforce Worldwide, 
defaultwill be eligible for free shares if they meet certain criteria. Employees of GLS and other subsidiaries and joint ventures are not eligible to receive free shares.
default 
defaultThe free employee shares will be of the same class as those available for wider sale. 
defaultEmploy
defaultees will therefore obtain voting rights and will be eligible to receive dividends like other shareholders. 
default&#xa0;
default4.13
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRoyal Mail employees who are eligible for an automatic free share allocation under the employee share scheme will also have the option to buy addit
defaultional shares through the
default Employee Priority Offer
default. Eligible employees will be given priority when those shares are allocated. 
default&#xa0;
default4.14
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe free shares to be offered on a flotation are not related to section 31 of the Growth and Infrastructure Act 2013. The free sh
defaultares are to be awarded under the long-standing, HMRC approved share plan known as a Share Incentive Plan. Further details have yet to be announced but, under HMRC rules, employees cannot be asked to pay anything or give anything up, including employment ri
defaultghts, to receive free shares.
default 
defaultRoyal Mail will write to all employees nearer the time of the issue. Employees will be given the option to opt-out of the employee share offer if they do not wish to participate for any reason.
default&#xa0;
defaultWorking with our unionsdefault&#xa0;
default4.15
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWorking together with our colleagues and unions
default is
default the best way to be successful. We work together with both the CWU and Unite on a range of issues, including reform of the regulatory regime, 
defaultnew ways of working, our Agenda for Growth, 
defaultworkplace safety, an
defaultd the issue of dangerous dogs. 
defaultWhilst we do not agree on everything, we value the input our unions give us and the work that they conduct throughout the business. We will continue to 
defaultwork closely
default with our union colleagues during the on
default-
defaultgoing transformation
default of the company.
default&#xa0;
default4.16
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRoyal Mail is currently negotiating a legally binding agreement on pay, terms and conditions for employees. 
defaultThe CWU have said that they will ballot for industrial action should 
defaultprogress not be made by September 2013
default. 
default&#xa0;
default4.17
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEven the suggestion
default of industrial action is not
default in the best interests of the company, its customers, or its employees. Royal Mail’s revenue is increasingly 
defaultgenerated by
default parcels – 48% of total revenue in 2012-13. This is a very competitive sector. Our customers have many choi
defaultces and can easily switch their business to competitors.
default 
defaultAny disruption to our service is not helpful.
default&#xa0;defaultPensionsdefault&#xa0;default4.18
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRoyal Mail’s main pension plan – the Royal Mail Pension Plan
default (RMPP)
default – was closed to new members in March 2008. At the same time, members
default’ benefits ceased to build up on a final salary basis and switched to Career Salary Defined Benefit. Despite these changes, the Plan remained one of the largest defined benefit schemes in the UK (based on membership and assets). 
defaultThe company made s
defaultignifican
defaultt pension deficit cash contributions on top of its ongoing pension costs
default.
default 
defaultIt
default recognised a deficit on its balance sheet which ranged from £2.7bn to £7.5bn. This meant Royal Mail faced issues with respect to Going Concern, it was balance sheet insolvent and 
defaultit carried material pension risk and volatility.
default&#xa0;
default4.19
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe European Commission granted State Aid approval on 21 March 2012, allowing the transfer of almost all of the pension liabilities and assets of RMPP built up until 31 March 2012 to be transferred to Gover
defaultnment. The transfer left RMPP fully funded on an actuarial basis at the time of the transfer, and immediately removed the requirement for the company to make further deficit cash contributions. 
default&#xa0;
default4.20
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDefined benefit pensions are becoming increasingly costly fo
defaultr all the remaining employers who offer such a scheme because of conditions in the financial markets, including very low gilt yields. 
defaultT
defaulthe proportion of companies that closed their defined benefit schemes to existing employees climbed to 31 per cent in 2012
default. This is an increase of more than a third from 23 per cent in 2011
default (Source: NAPF)
default.
default&#xa0;default4.21
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFollowing the transfer 
defaultof the majority of the assets and liabilities in the RMPP 
defaultto the Royal Mail Statutory Pensions Scheme, t
defaulthe Government 
defaultnow 
defaultstands behind the 
defaultbenefits
default 
defaultRoyal Mail Pension Plan 
defaultmembers built up
default defaultuntil 31 March 2012. The Government is legally responsible for the
default defaultpension members of the P
defaultlan built up until that date
default. However, the 
defaultpredicted cost of the Plan going forward
default has been affected by
default falling gilt yields
default, as outlined above.
default&#xa0;
default4.22
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRoyal Mail has a proposal to keep the Royal Mail Pension Plan open for existing members, subject to certain conditions, at least until the end of the
default Company’s
default next periodic review in March 2018
default. 
defaultThe consultation o
defaultn the proposal closed on 25 August 2013
default.
default The company is now considering / reviewing member feedback and continuing discussions with its unions.
default&#xa0;
default4.23
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe proposal would
default use some of the 
defaultc.
default£2 billion of assets left in the Plan
default defaultat the time of
default the transfer to Gover
defaultnment last year to keep the Plan open
default until at least the conclusion of the next periodic review in 2018, and subject to conditions
default.
default defaultCompared to many other define
defaultd benefit pension schemes, the C
defaultompany is in a
default defaultstrong position. Many employers have announced t
defaulthey are closing their
default defaultschemes. We have a proposal to keep the
default defaultPlan open.
default defaultPlan members will not have to pay more, and retirement age and
default defaultaccrual rates will not change.
default&#xa0;
default4.24
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMembers’ pension benefits are important. Royal Mail knows how much members
default defaultvalue the 
defaultbenefits provided. Royal Mail already puts approximately £400
default defaultmillion in cash in
defaultto the Plan every year and will
default keep doing so.
default defaultWe believe this is the largest ongoing contribution of any UK company. 
defaultAn
default defaultagreement on our pension proposal would, subject to its

defaultThe long-term commercial agreement ensures that Royal Mail services 
defaultwill continue to be
default available through all post offices in the future.
default In January 2012, then Postal Services Minister Edward Davey said:
default&#xa0;
default“Concerns people had about the Post Office becoming independent from Royal Mail were always misplaced as that separation is part of our cu
defaultre, but the ten year deal struck between Royal Mail and the Post Office will give subpostmasters and others greater confidence.”
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn Post O
defaultffice Ltd’s Network Report 2013, it said that there has been “greater stability over recent years than has been the c
defaultase for the previous quarter of a century.”
default&#xa0;
default5.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is in both Royal Mail and Post Office Ltd’s interest to ensure a strong, comprehensive post office network. Combined with Government funding of the Post Office and allowing Royal Mail to access external capit
defaultal, separation will safeguard the future of both companies and the commercial relationship between them. 
defaultSeparation has also given Post Office management greater freedom to focus on its customers and growing its revenue base.
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultContinued
default transformation of R
defaultoyal Mail would result in more business – particularly from the growing parcels market - going through post offices, and a stronger post office network. At the same time, the Post Office Network Transformation programme will result in longer opening hours 
defaultat post offices, and greater flexibility for postal services users. This will allow Royal Mail’s customers greater access to parcels services and benefit both companies. 
default&#xa0;

defaultRoyal 
defaultMail, working with the Post Office, will later this year 
defaultlaunch 
defaultthe UK’s large
defaultst ‘click and collect’ network to support online shopping growth by providing greater choice of convenient parcel delivery options for online retailers and their customers.
default 
defaultPost Office has the largest retail network in the UK, making branches the ideal loc
defaultations to provide convenient, secure parcel collection facilities. 99 per cent of the population lives within three miles of a Post Office branch. Around 10,500 Post Offices will be taking part in the initiative which will enable online retailers to offer 
defaultshoppers the opportunity to order items for collection at their local 
defaultpost office 
defaultbranch.

defaultHeritagedefault&#xa0;
default5.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRoyal Mail is proud of its heritage. It is one of the best 
defaultknown and trusted 
defaultbrands in the country. There would be no incentive to rebrand or change its iconic visual symbols like post boxes. 
defaultTo do so would require very significant expenditure and 
defaultwould 
defaultrisk alienating our customers.
default&#xa0;
default5.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Sovereign will continue to approve all 
defaultstamp issues. The Secretary of State has the power to ensure her image
default, and the image of subsequent Monarchs,
default appears on stamps. This process is safeguarded in the Postal Services Act 2011 (Section 62 – “UK postage stamps bearing an image of Her Majesty”
default a
defaultnd Section 10, Interpretation Act 1978 – “References to the Sovereign”
default).

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Government’s recent reforms have put Royal Mail back in a position to compete and grow. The transfer of the 
defaultto the Government of the Group’s pension liabilities for pre-1 April 2012 service and 
defaultcertain assets relating to the Royal Mail Pension Plan,
default and reform of the regulatory framework, alongside an acceleration in the company’s transformation programme, have returned Royal Mail to profit.
