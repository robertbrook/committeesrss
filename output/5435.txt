[[[Written Evidence from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills [OD0030]]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;Thank you for your letter of 19th December seeking additional information and for agreeing to an extension whilst we gathered the necessary information. &#xa0;The information that you requested is contained in Annex 1 and 2 of this letter. The response covers revenue accrued by the Department for Business and our six trading funds – the four that form the Public Data Group (Companies House, Land Registry, Met Office and Ordnance Survey) as well as the Intellectual Property Office and Insolvency Service. Information covering the rest of government is not available centrally at this level of detail, and would therefore need to be collected from each Department separately. &#xa0;You stated in your letter that your committee wishes to understand “both sides of the equation” when assessing the costs of and benefits of releasing public sector information (PSI). Some additional information is important when considering the potentially ‘lost’ revenue against the £1.8bn value you refer to in your letter. &#xa0;This is a complex area and, as the Deloitte study noted when calculating its assessment, there is a “lack of reliable data” including the “number of users by dataset and how users are exploiting public sector information”. The supporting descriptions included with the information we have provided also highlight the challenge of defining the revenue from ‘data’ sales. The Government has accepted that there is value in making PSI more available and has done, as we have demonstrated over the witness session and in subsequent evidence. &#xa0;It is important to note when we consider the benefits of making PSI more available that the £1.8bn figure you refer to is the value of PSI that was already accessible when the study was undertaken. Of the £1.6bn of this value classified as ‘direct consumer surplus’ (e.g. the direct benefits to users of that data) 60%, or over £900m, is attributed to Open Data already released by Public Data Group (PDG) members. Given that further data sets have been released since the study was undertaken, this value is likely to be now even higher. This figure also needs to be put in the context that Trading Fund data only forms part of the vast whole of PSI. &#xa0;We are looking at ways in which the value of PSI to the UK can be increased. The £1.6bn also includes almost £300m of consumer surplus attributed to PDG data that is charged for and releasing this for free would likely increase this surplus. However, to do so would have a cost to Government and and there is no guarantee that this cost would be off set by any increased tax recipts resulting from this data becoming freely available. A study of the Ordnance Survey OpenData offer, “Assessing the Value of OS OpenData to the Economy of Great Britain”, found net economic gains of £13.0m - £28.5m from 2016. As these gains are for a scheme that requires £20m per annum in funding, and only a portion of the economic gains would produce tax revenue, there would still be an annual net cost to the Exchequer of between £11.7m and £15.6m. Although this is a single report, which itself notes the challenge in obtaining all the relevant data on how Open Data is subsequently used, these findings indicate the need to be cautious. &#xa0;In addition to lost revenue it is also important to note the uncertainty around how releasing certain forms of data will impact UK businesses. Prior to the launch of OS OpenData, Ordnance Survey licensed paid-for products to a number of global web mapping and satnav providers which are now available as Ordnance Survey OpenData. Revenues from these and similar partners for CodePoint alone were in excess of £2.5m pa in 2009. There is little evidence that these global players have changed their products and services as a result of the removal of charging and the long term impact on the UK's specialist geospatial sector of a standard form of mapping information becoming ubiquitous is unclear. I note that the Committee has not yet received evidence from members of the geospatial business community and I would invite the Committee to explore their views on this matter before finalising its report. &#xa0;In addition, making data available for free can also have indirect costs for the organisations involved. The Land Registry open data releases have not only led to a decline in revenue from its Price Paid products but it has also experienced an increase in its support costs as the number of calls querying the accuracy of the data, on 3rd party websites, has risen. &#xa0;Within the pragmatic approach we have taken, work has however continued to tackle the barriers to increasing the value of PSI set out in both the Shakespeare Review and the Deloitte Study: &#xa0;&#xa0;o PDG members already make very large amount of data available – as either open or charged for at commercial or marginal rates. The only data that is unavailable in any form is that relating to personal information or for security reasons. &#xa0;o PDG members have also made great efforts to increase awareness of the data that is available– and make it easily accessible. A recent Land Registry survey indentified that a large number of their users valued access (and quality) over price. &#xa0;o There are considerable efforts made to provide support and engagement to users to allow them to access the data more effectively. It is important that we also focus adequate attention on deriving the maximum value of the data that is already available. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;o PDG members have already made available as Open Data very large amounts of data and will continue to explore options to add to this &#xa0;o As the information provided above shows data that is only commercially available is offered through a range of licences designed that should offer minimal barriers to entry. I have previously supplied to you information on how both the Ordnance Survey and Met Office offer licences specifically designed to support developers. &#xa0;o The Deloitte study noted that the difficulty in establishing the number of users deterred by price and it is clear that releasing data for free also results in a degree of deadweight as organisations that were previously willing to pay no longer need to do so. &#xa0;Overall, I believe that the balanced approach this Government has taken, strongly supporting the Open Data Agenda and facilitating the use of PSI to support growth but applying pragmatism where necessary to protect the taxpayer, has been the correct one. I look forward to reading your Committee’s final report.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Annex 1: Revenue Accrued by BIS and its Trading Funds from the sale of data &#xa0;

[[[BIS ]]]As far as the Department can ascertain we have not accrued any revenue from the sale of data for the financial years 2010/11, 2011/12 and 2012/13. &#xa0;

[[[BIS Trading Funds ]]]The vast majority of data sales undertaken by BIS Trading Funds are made by the Public Data Group (Companies House, Land Registry, Met Office and Ordnance Survey) although some income is received by the Intellectual Property Office. As far as can be ascertained Insolvency Service have not accrued any revenue from the sale of data. &#xa0;

[[[Intellectual Property Office ]]]The data available for sale from the UK IPO covers UK trade marks and patents. This represents approximately 0.06% of the IPO’s £74m revenue. The charge is intended to cover the cost of making the data available in this format and providing regular updates and support to users. If the data was made freely available this cost would have to be covered by rights holders via fees. All this data is available to be searched free of charge via the IPO’s website or those of other national bodies. It is also possible to get support to search this data, if required, either by contacting the IPO or 13 patent information centres around the UK or, alternatively, via the European network of patent information centres. &#xa0;The British Library does hold a physical set of UK specifications. However, all live cases can be printed via the IPO website.&#xa0;

[[[Public Data Group ]]]The following tables provide information on each Trading Fund including separation of the revenue received from the public sector and the private. The revenue received from the public sector, where appropriate, is shown gross and net of the dividend paid to the Exchequer by each Trading Fund as I believe it is import to be aware of the offsetting effects this has on the true cost of any data provision to the public sector. This representation has been simplified by showing the net cost as though 100% of the dividend had been applied against the costs. &#xa0;It should also be noted that these tables do not include operating costs. This means that it is not possible to directly infer from these figures what the cost of making this data available for free would be as without these revenue streams, funding would still be required to support both the collection and distribution of the data. These costs will vary distinctly between data produced as the ‘exhaust’ generated through the performance of regular activities as is the case for much of Companies House and the Land Registry’s data and data that has been specifically collected as is often the case for the Met Office and Ordnance Survey.&#xa0;Revenue received from sales of data - Public Data Group &#xa0;

For the purpose of this exercise ‘data’ has been interpreted to mean the information on the register, and included the image revenue.&#xa0;

They also set out that proportion of the Public Weather Service (PWS) associated with data collection. As this data is not purchased by the public sector per se but rather forms a component of the international data used by the Met Office in producing its analysis it has not been included in the revenue total. &#xa0;It is important to note that a significant part of Met Office government and commercial revenue is obtained through proving and selling services and expertise. For instance the majority of the PWS is essentially a fee for an entire National Weather Service - not payment for data - and if all the underlying data was available for free HMG would still need to pay for the collection, creation and maintenance of that data and also for specific Public Weather Service outputs. &#xa0;

[[[Public Data Group ]]]&#xa0;Due to the extremely varied and large number of products available I have sought to provide you with an indication of the overall approach taken by each Trading Fund rather than a list. &#xa0;

[[[Companies House ]]]&#xa0;Companies House provided in 2011/12 over 135 million free searches for basic company information, rising to upwards of 225 million in 2012/13. &#xa0;Fees for individual searches are mainly £1 ie search for an image of a set of accounts and Bulk Data products to business ranging from £30 to £28k. &#xa0;Companies House, as a public information provider, has a statutory duty to make all information relating to limited companies available for public inspection. It places no restriction on how the information is used after purchase, although requires that CH is credited as the source of information. &#xa0;

[[[Land Registry ]]]&#xa0;All of Land Registry’s data offerings are unit priced based on a cost plus pricing model. This is to ensure that the portfolio, including free data, forms part of a sustainable model. Therefore prices can range from as little as £0.05/£1.50 and go up to a basic minimum price of £500 for some geographical offerings which also take into account third party royalty charges. &#xa0;

[[[Met Office ]]]&#xa0;The Met Office offer their wholesale data for purchase through ECOMET. ECOMET is an Economic Interest Grouping of European National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) which provides a platform for each NMHS to make its basic met data and products available for re-use for research, official duty and commercial activities. Licences depend on the intended use of the data and/or products: &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;As an example of the end price customers who only require operational observational data, in the form of realtime delivery of bulletins, will pay only around €1,500.00 per annum. Those requiring more information can pay substantially more. &#xa0;It is important to note however that research and education communities are granted free and unrestricted access to all data and products for non-commercial activities. In the UK this service is provided through the British Atmospheric Data Centre, through an agreement with Natural Environment Research Council (NERC). &#xa0;In addition, as I have set out previously, a range of industry standard data is available through DataPoint as a free service providing an individual’s usage does not exceed a fair use policy. This allows developers to experiment and trial the appeal of potential products built on this data and, in most cases, offer a product to market without any financial commitment. &#xa0;

[[[Ordnance Survey ]]]&#xa0;Ordnance Survey (OS) operates a market value-based pricing model across a range of broad market sectors within Great Britain. At a high level, the products and services offered by OS are available on a royalty model basis. This is quantity-based, with the price determined by the amount of geography/extent of data taken. Discounts on list price are available depending on customer size (terminal banding), and/or for customers committing to longer than standard contract terms (standard is 12 months). Certain datasets are also available, under licence, free at the point of use, under the Open Data banner. &#xa0;Revenue comes either direct (the provision of data and services directly to a customer for their own use) or through licenced partners (who resell the data, or create value added services based upon it).&#xa0;Ordnance Survey currently has over 500 licenced partners ranging from global corporates to micro-businesses who take data to create value-added products and services for their markets. These partners have access to all the products but only return a royalty once their products are being used in the market. Since April 2011 over 600 businesses and organisations have licenced paid-for data for free under the Developer and Evaluation licences, to determine whether the data can help them grow and manage their businesses. &#xa0;The majority of SMEs that use Ordnance Survey data obtain this through their licenced partners and therefore they do not hold the data on how much they charge. &#xa0;Businesses that wish to deal direct with Ordnance Survey will sign the Framework Contract (Direct) which sets out standard contractual requirements and limitations for the use of Ordnance Survey data. Then the customer will sign up to the relevant product contract and pricing. The pricing will depend on a variety of factors: &#xa0;o Amount of data taken (i.e., km length, km2 area, hectare2 area, number of tiles, number off address records/points/boundary lines, geography type [settlement, rural, moorland] etc.) &#xa0;o Size of organisation (based on terminal banding [number of users]) o Term of contract (standard term is 1 year, but longer terms are discounted in some cases) &#xa0;Minimum charges/royalties also apply, depending on product, that ensure product maintenance and servicing costs remain covered. &#xa0;To give an example of how these pricing would in practice please see the following hypothetical examples: &#xa0;Example 1 – an estate agent An estate agent purchases Vector Map Local (detailed 1 10000 scale mapping) covering Sheffield on a one year licence for use on up to 20 terminals. The data is used within their offices to map properties they are marketing for sale in the area, analyse and display sales trends and target potential future vendors. &#xa0;Total cost of data = £263.88 &#xa0;Calculated as follows: &#xa0;Per tile @ £14.66 = £439.80 &#xa0;Less 40% terminal band discount for less than 0.5% GB coverage = £263.88 &#xa0;Example 2 – a courier A London based courier company purchases AddressBase on a one year licence for use on up to 5 terminals for The London Boroughs of Westminster, Hackney and Richmond. They use the data to precisely identify the location of each property in the Borough, giving them a level detail above and beyond Postcode data &#xa0;AB @ £0.0080 per address for first 5 million addresses = £2440.87 (less than a penny per address) &#xa0;Less 60% terminal band discount as a small user= £976.35 &#xa0;Example 3 – a building development Data supporting a 4 hectare building development in Central London e.g. The Shard or similar &#xa0;First hectare settlement data @ £18.30 &#xa0;Each subsequent settlement hectare @ £9.14 = £27.42 &#xa0;Total = £45.72 &#xa0;Example 4 – data for GPS navigation A complete national dataset of 1 50 000 mapping (c240 000 km2) for use in an outdoor GPS navigation device eg Garmin, SatMap &#xa0;Total per device = £20.51&#xa0;&#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;
