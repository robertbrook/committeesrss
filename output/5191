[normal]Written evidence submitted by BBC Media Action
[normal]Executive Summary: [bold]This paper
[normal] is 
[normal]written 
[normal]in response to the
[normal] 
[normal]decision by the 
[normal]International 
[normal]Development 
[normal]Committee
[normal] of the UK 
[normal]Parliament
[normal] to undertake an inquiry into DFID’s work in the Middle East
[normal] and specifically “the 
[normal]effectiveness of DFID’s programme in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.” 
[normal]Th
[normal]e p
[normal]aper concentrates on BBC Media Action’s experiences in the Occupied Palestinian
[normal] Territories where
[normal] 
[normal]we have 
[normal]been working since November 2011 
[normal]funded by 
[normal]DFID through a 5
[normal]-
[normal]year accountable grant, termed the Global Grant, through DFID’
[normal]s Policy Division in London
[normal]. In addition Media Action has, 
[normal]since April 2013
[normal], been 
[normal]an implementing partner 
[normal]in a
[normal] 
[normal]contract
[normal] won
[normal] by the British Council under 
[normal]a 
[normal]DFID Framework Tender
[normal] entitled
[normal] 
[normal]‘Supporting Stability and Promoting Democracy in the Occupied Territories
[normal].”
[normal] The central argument of this submission is that media plays a key part in the lives of Palestinians
[normal] and that as a result, 
[normal]high quality and editorially robust 
[normal]programmes tha
[normal]t 
[normal]a
[normal]llow a cross-
[normal]section of Palestinian society to hold leaders to account
[normal] are central to the OPT’s future democratic development.
[normal] In particular, 
[normal]o
[normal]nline and social media are powerful 
[normal]tools for connecting communities which are divided both geographically and politically (West Bank, the Gaza strip
[normal], the diaspora
[normal]), 
[normal]as well as e
[normal]ssential mobili
[normal]s
[normal]ation tools for Palestinian youth
[normal].

[normal]Barriers [bold]to freedom of expression [bold]in the [bold]O[bold]PT: [bold]&#xa0;[bold]Media development through debate shows:[bold]12. 
[normal]BBC Media Action believes that public service
[normal] broadcasting is ultimately about serving the needs of audience
[normal]s
[normal]. 
[normal]Through 
[normal]a
[normal] 
[normal]partnership with Palestine TV
[normal],
[normal] BBC Media Action 
[normal]puts the general public at the heart of its programme-making
[normal] by giving audiences a voice to which they are entitled, by giving them a say in shaping decisions over how their communities are run and by requiring those in power to be accountable to them
[normal]. 
[normal]In turn, by
[normal] 
[normal]enabling the 
[normal]availability of accessible and relevan
[normal]t information 
[normal]on 
[normal]a wide range of issues, 
[normal]the hope is that these programmes help contribute
[normal] to higher levels of 
[normal]self- 
[normal]efficacy, motivation and participation, 
[normal]all 
[normal]necessary drivers of 
[normal]accountability.
[normal]13. 
[normal]Our f
[normal]ormative research showed that Palestinians are 
[normal]interested in issues that affect the running of their daily lives, whether
[normal] 
[normal]health service delivery, employment, emigration or domestic violence. 
[normal]The 
[normal]Voices of Palestine
[normal] programme on domestic violence and sexual harassment
[normal], for example,
[normal] took place at the po
[normal]lice college in Jericho
[normal]. The panel
[normal] included 
[normal]a
[normal] female police officer responsible for domestic violence &amp; sexual harassment issues, a female criminologist from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and the Head of the Sharia Courts. The audience contained 
[normal]both 
[normal]men and women with a strong representation of police cadets. There wa
[normal]s
[normal] a very lively debate about the appropriateness of women’s 
[normal]dress
[normal];
[normal] with female participants making it clear that sexual harassment was unacceptable 
[normal]regardless of clothing choices women ma
[normal]y make
[normal]. 
[normal]14. 
[normal]The 
[normal]Hur El Kalam
[normal] programme on the provision of health services raised a num
[normal]ber of issues concerning health care 
[normal]rationing
[normal]. There was heated debate over 
[normal]why some patients 
[normal]were allowed to die from critical illness rather than getting treatment, 
[normal]particularly 
[normal]when it was clear that 
[normal]some
[normal] hospitals in Israel and Jordan would be willing to carry out the surgery. There was 
[normal]also 
[normal]a strong discussion on why the PA did not do more to punish people who sold 
[normal]counterfeit
[normal] 
[normal]or out-of-
[normal]date drugs. The most harrowi
[normal]ng part of the programme was when a man described losing his wife to medical negligence
[normal], 
[normal]saying that he felt helpless because there was no mechanism 
[normal]to r
[normal]edress he failings he had experienced
[normal] in the health system
[normal]. 
[normal]The Health Minister pledged on the programm
[normal]e to review this gentleman’s case and take action if warranted.
[normal]15.
[normal] 
[normal]We also 
[normal]work closely with our partner stations to build capacity around public service broadcasting values. 
[normal]To make the 
[normal]Hur El Kalam
[normal] programme on disability, 
[normal]for example, 
[normal]B
[normal]BC Media Action 
[normal]organized a day-
[normal]long workshop for the production team with a local disability charity
[normal]. The purpose of the workshop was
[normal] to sensitise 
[normal]PTV staff 
[normal]to disability issues
[normal] as well as to how disability is portrayed in the media,
[normal] 
[normal]something the crew
[normal] 
[normal]had not previously
[normal] considered. 
[normal]The programme was extremely powerful
[normal],
[normal] particularly when it became clear that one of the audience members had not been able to take up a position in the ministry responsible for 
[normal]disability because he himself was wheel
[normal]chair bound and there was n
[normal]o disabled access to the ministry buildi
[normal]ng!
[normal]16. 
[normal]Overall, BBC Media Action
[normal] programming in OPT seeks to secure 
[normal]‘more accountable, peaceful and inclusive state and non-state relations in the Palestinian context
[normal],
[normal]’ characterised by increased 
[normal]public 
[normal]engagement i
[normal]n and influence over decision-making and service provision; increased responsiveness of 
[normal]government 
[normal]authorities and national service providers to people’s needs, and 
[normal]the evolution of social 
[normal]norms conducive to effective negotiation and debate on governance c
[normal]hallenges
[normal]. 
[normal]We measure impact through 
[normal]levels of informed engagement with gove
[normal]rnance debate and service delivery; youth motivation and engagement in political processes; and local media capacity to support more constructive and objective governance debate 
[normal]and engagement
[normal] in OPT
[normal]. 
[normal]After the first year, our nationally representative data show 
[normal]that both programmes are already achieving many of these targets
[normal]. (86% of those watching believe that the shows are playing a role in holding government to account and 83%
[normal] report improved understanding of governance or conflict-relevant issues as a result of watching the shows)
[normal].

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Social Media[bold] as a tool for [bold]e[bold]ngagement[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]17. 
[normal]Because of the way the OPT is laid out geographically – spanning two different regions and without free movement between them – it’s not possible to have a fully representative studio audience that cuts across all segments of society. Under such circumstan
[normal]ces, social media is a particularly powerful tool for enabling 
[normal]people from different areas to voice their opinions and become part of the process 
[normal]of
[normal] holding their leaders to account
[normal].
[normal]18.  
[normal]Palestinians are 
[normal]o
[normal]verwhelmingly young
[normal], 
[normal]with approximately 64% of the
[normal] population under the age of 25 years and  20% of the total population between the ages of 15 -24.
[normal] 
[normal]BBC M
[normal]edia 
[normal]A
[normal]ction
[normal]’s qualitative formative research underline
[normal]d
[normal] the importance of social media for youth (16-25 years) 
[normal]as a means both of 
[normal]consuming current aff
[normal]airs and political material
[normal],
[normal] but also for sharing information and interacting with other actors
[normal] in civil society
[normal]. A poll of 1,200 Palestinian youth in January 2012 found that 32% reported having participated at least once in an internet social group to lob
[normal]by on a public issue
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]S
[normal]ocial media 
[normal]is ubiquitous across all audience segments. 
[normal]19. 
[normal]A
[normal]lthough 
[normal]social media is a very popular media tool
[normal] in OPT
[normal], 
[normal]media 
[normal]programmes concentrating on governance had not 
[normal]previously 
[normal]used 
[normal]social media
[normal] 
[normal]to connect with audience memb
[normal]ers. 
[normal]Instead
[normal], social media networks such as Facebook 
[normal]ha
[normal]d
[normal] 
[normal]largely been used for individual advocacy efforts.  
[normal]20. In contrast, s
[normal]ocial media is a core aspect
[normal] of both BBC Media Action-supported debate programmes
[normal] 
[normal]as 
[normal]it allows people from different ages (especially youth) 
[normal]– and regions, as well as the diaspora - 
[normal]to be involved in the 
[normal]discussion
[normal] 
[normal]rather than being limited to the audience present in the studio. 
[normal] 
[normal]Since starting its official Facebook page
[normal],
[normal] PBC 
[normal]has increased
[normal] its interaction with the audience five-
[normal]fold.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Conclusions and [bold]Recommendations:[bold]21. 
[normal]The media is a potentially powerful tool in 
[normal]enabling 
[normal]a peaceful, inclusive, accountable OPT
[normal], with 
[normal]more than 85% of those watching BBC Media Action-supported debate progra
[normal]mmes believing that the shows are playing a role in holding government to account
[normal]. 
[normal]22. 
[normal]BBC Media Action’s needs analysis shows that participatory media formats that engage 
[normal]people  
[normal]and politicians alike on issues of everyday service delivery are both 
[normal]demanded – and feasible – in OPT.
[normal]23. 
[normal]Due to the particular characteristics of Palestinian demographic, economic and social divisions, as well as the importance of the Palestinian diaspora, the internet provides a unique platform for communication and
[normal] enga
[normal]gement
[normal]. 
[normal]Social media
[normal] helps reduce offline boundaries and offset the lack of mobility in the territories and beyond
[normal], while also drawing in youth audiences.
[normal]24. 
[normal]Nearly one third of Palestinian youth surveyed by BBC Media Action reported using social media at
[normal] least once to engage in public affairs. In a 
[normal]territory 
[normal]where nearly 2/3 of the entire population is under the age of 25, 
[normal]schools and universities alike should be encouraged to develop 
[normal]curricula 
[normal]that 
[normal]teach 
[normal]media literac
[normal]y so that students learn to use socia
[normal]l media tools in a responsible manner and in support of a public purpose. 
[normal]2
[normal]5
[normal]. 
[normal]Local media might also consider experimenting with n
[normal]on
[normal]-
[normal]traditional forms of media that 
[normal]can stimulate discussion and debate on governance in the OPT. 
[normal]Programming 
[normal]from elsewhere 
[normal]suggests that drama series, game shows, quizzes and 
[normal]satire
[normal] can also play a role in 
[normal]holding
[normal] 
[normal]leaders 
[normal]government
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]to account.
[normal]26
[normal]. 
[normal]Government agencies should be encouraged to
[normal] 
[normal]actively encourage and provide opportunities for citizens to express opinions,
[normal] 
[normal]ask qu
[normal]estions and receive a credible response. 
[normal]Government departments in the OPT should promote services more effectively, accept public criticism of those services and take part in relevant media programming that enables citizens to express opinions, ask questi
[normal]ons and receive a credible response. 
[normal]27. 
[normal]The emerging ﬁeld of mGovernance 
[normal]elsewhere in the developing world 
[normal]offers a particularly compelling example in this regard. On the supply side, mobile phones are being used to provide people with basic information 
[normal]about local and national politics via SMS and voice-based communication software. On the demand side, even quite basic mobile phones are being used for accountability ends as diverse as monitoring elections, improving service delivery and tackling corrupti
[normal]on at the local level.
