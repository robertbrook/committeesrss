defaultWritten evidence submitted by BBC Media Action
defaultExecutive Summary: defaultThis paper
default is 
defaultwritten 
defaultin response to the
default 
defaultdecision by the 
defaultInternational 
defaultDevelopment 
defaultCommittee
default of the UK 
defaultParliament
default to undertake an inquiry into DFID’s work in the Middle East
default and specifically “the 
defaulteffectiveness of DFID’s programme in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.” 
defaultTh
defaulte p
defaultaper concentrates on BBC Media Action’s experiences in the Occupied Palestinian
default Territories where
default 
defaultwe have 
defaultbeen working since November 2011 
defaultfunded by 
defaultDFID through a 5
default-
defaultyear accountable grant, termed the Global Grant, through DFID’
defaults Policy Division in London
default. In addition Media Action has, 
defaultsince April 2013
default, been 
defaultan implementing partner 
defaultin a
default 
defaultcontract
default won
default by the British Council under 
defaulta 
defaultDFID Framework Tender
default entitled
default 
default‘Supporting Stability and Promoting Democracy in the Occupied Territories
default.”
default The central argument of this submission is that media plays a key part in the lives of Palestinians
default and that as a result, 
defaulthigh quality and editorially robust 
defaultprogrammes tha
defaultt 
defaulta
defaultllow a cross-
defaultsection of Palestinian society to hold leaders to account
default are central to the OPT’s future democratic development.
default In particular, 
defaulto
defaultnline and social media are powerful 
defaulttools for connecting communities which are divided both geographically and politically (West Bank, the Gaza strip
default, the diaspora
default), 
defaultas well as e
defaultssential mobili
defaults
defaultation tools for Palestinian youth
default.

defaultBBC Media Action believes that public service
default broadcasting is ultimately about serving the needs of audience
defaults
default. 
defaultThrough 
defaulta
default 
defaultpartnership with Palestine TV
default,
default BBC Media Action 
defaultputs the general public at the heart of its programme-making
default by giving audiences a voice to which they are entitled, by giving them a say in shaping decisions over how their communities are run and by requiring those in power to be accountable to them
default. 
defaultIn turn, by
default 
defaultenabling the 
defaultavailability of accessible and relevan
defaultt information 
defaulton 
defaulta wide range of issues, 
defaultthe hope is that these programmes help contribute
default to higher levels of 
defaultself- 
defaultefficacy, motivation and participation, 
defaultall 
defaultnecessary drivers of 
defaultaccountability.
default13. 
defaultOur f
defaultormative research showed that Palestinians are 
defaultinterested in issues that affect the running of their daily lives, whether
default 
defaulthealth service delivery, employment, emigration or domestic violence. 
defaultThe 
defaultVoices of Palestine
default programme on domestic violence and sexual harassment
default, for example,
default took place at the po
defaultlice college in Jericho
default. The panel
default included 
defaulta
default female police officer responsible for domestic violence &amp; sexual harassment issues, a female criminologist from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and the Head of the Sharia Courts. The audience contained 
defaultboth 
defaultmen and women with a strong representation of police cadets. There wa
defaults
default a very lively debate about the appropriateness of women’s 
defaultdress
default;
default with female participants making it clear that sexual harassment was unacceptable 
defaultregardless of clothing choices women ma
defaulty make
default. 
default14. 
defaultThe 
defaultHur El Kalam
default programme on the provision of health services raised a num
defaultber of issues concerning health care 
defaultrationing
default. There was heated debate over 
defaultwhy some patients 
defaultwere allowed to die from critical illness rather than getting treatment, 
defaultparticularly 
defaultwhen it was clear that 
defaultsome
default hospitals in Israel and Jordan would be willing to carry out the surgery. There was 
defaultalso 
defaulta strong discussion on why the PA did not do more to punish people who sold 
defaultcounterfeit
default 
defaultor out-of-
defaultdate drugs. The most harrowi
defaultng part of the programme was when a man described losing his wife to medical negligence
default, 
defaultsaying that he felt helpless because there was no mechanism 
defaultto r
defaultedress he failings he had experienced
default in the health system
default. 
defaultThe Health Minister pledged on the programm
defaulte to review this gentleman’s case and take action if warranted.
default15.
default 
defaultWe also 
defaultwork closely with our partner stations to build capacity around public service broadcasting values. 
defaultTo make the 
defaultHur El Kalam
default programme on disability, 
defaultfor example, 
defaultB
defaultBC Media Action 
defaultorganized a day-
defaultlong workshop for the production team with a local disability charity
default. The purpose of the workshop was
default to sensitise 
defaultPTV staff 
defaultto disability issues
default as well as to how disability is portrayed in the media,
default 
defaultsomething the crew
default 
defaulthad not previously
default considered. 
defaultThe programme was extremely powerful
default,
default particularly when it became clear that one of the audience members had not been able to take up a position in the ministry responsible for 
defaultdisability because he himself was wheel
defaultchair bound and there was n
defaulto disabled access to the ministry buildi
defaultng!
default16. 
defaultOverall, BBC Media Action
default programming in OPT seeks to secure 
default‘more accountable, peaceful and inclusive state and non-state relations in the Palestinian context
default,
default’ characterised by increased 
defaultpublic 
defaultengagement i
defaultn and influence over decision-making and service provision; increased responsiveness of 
defaultgovernment 
defaultauthorities and national service providers to people’s needs, and 
defaultthe evolution of social 
defaultnorms conducive to effective negotiation and debate on governance c
defaulthallenges
default. 
defaultWe measure impact through 
defaultlevels of informed engagement with gove
defaultrnance debate and service delivery; youth motivation and engagement in political processes; and local media capacity to support more constructive and objective governance debate 
defaultand engagement
default in OPT
default. 
defaultAfter the first year, our nationally representative data show 
defaultthat both programmes are already achieving many of these targets
default. (86% of those watching believe that the shows are playing a role in holding government to account and 83%
default report improved understanding of governance or conflict-relevant issues as a result of watching the shows)
default.

defaultSocial Mediadefault as a tool for defaultedefaultngagementdefault&#xa0;
default17. 
defaultBecause of the way the OPT is laid out geographically – spanning two different regions and without free movement between them – it’s not possible to have a fully representative studio audience that cuts across all segments of society. Under such circumstan
defaultces, social media is a particularly powerful tool for enabling 
defaultpeople from different areas to voice their opinions and become part of the process 
defaultof
default holding their leaders to account
default.
default18.  
defaultPalestinians are 
defaulto
defaultverwhelmingly young
default, 
defaultwith approximately 64% of the
default population under the age of 25 years and  20% of the total population between the ages of 15 -24.
default 
defaultBBC M

default’s qualitative formative research underline
defaultd
default the importance of social media for youth (16-25 years) 
defaultas a means both of 
defaultconsuming current aff
defaultairs and political material
default,
default but also for sharing information and interacting with other actors
default in civil society
default. A poll of 1,200 Palestinian youth in January 2012 found that 32% reported having participated at least once in an internet social group to lob
defaultby on a public issue
default.

default

defaultit allows people from different ages (especially youth)

defaultConclusions and defaultRecommendations:default21. 
defaultThe media is a potentially powerful tool in 
defaultenabling 
defaulta peaceful, inclusive, accountable OPT
default, with 
defaultmore than 85% of those watching BBC Media Action-supported debate progra
defaultmmes believing that the shows are playing a role in holding government to account
default. 
default22. 
defaultBBC Media Action’s needs analysis shows that participatory media formats that engage 
defaultpeople  
defaultand politicians alike on issues of everyday service delivery are both 
defaultdemanded – and feasible – in OPT.
default23. 
defaultDue to the particular characteristics of Palestinian demographic, economic and social divisions, as well as the importance of the Palestinian diaspora, the internet provides a unique platform for communication and
default enga
defaultgement
default. 
defaultSocial media
default helps reduce offline boundaries and offset the lack of mobility in the territories and beyond
default, while also drawing in youth audiences.
default24. 
defaultNearly one third of Palestinian youth surveyed by BBC Media Action reported using social media at
default least once to engage in public affairs. In a 
defaultterritory 
defaultwhere nearly 2/3 of the entire population is under the age of 25, 
defaultschools and universities alike should be encouraged to develop 
defaultcurricula 
defaultthat 
defaultteach 
defaultmedia literac
defaulty so that students learn to use socia
defaultl media tools in a responsible manner and in support of a public purpose.

default. 
defaultLocal media might also consider experimenting with n
defaulton
default-
defaulttraditional forms of media that 
defaultcan stimulate discussion and debate on governance in the OPT. 
defaultProgramming 
defaultfrom elsewhere 
defaultsuggests that drama series, game shows, quizzes and 
defaultsatire
default can also play a role in 
defaultholding
default 
defaultleaders 
defaultgovernment
defaults
default 
defaultto account.
default26
default. 
defaultGovernment agencies should be encouraged to
default 
defaultactively encourage and provide opportunities for citizens to express opinions,
default 
defaultask qu
defaultestions and receive a credible response. 
defaultGovernment departments in the OPT should promote services more effectively, accept public criticism of those services and take part in relevant media programming that enables citizens to express opinions, ask questi
defaultons and receive a credible response. 
default27. 
defaultThe emerging ﬁeld of mGovernance 
defaultelsewhere in the developing world 
defaultoffers a particularly compelling example in this regard. On the supply side, mobile phones are being used to provide people with basic information 
defaultabout local and national politics via SMS and voice-based communication software. On the demand side, even quite basic mobile phones are being used for accountability ends as diverse as monitoring elections, improving service delivery and tackling corrupti
defaulton at the local level.
