[[[The keeping of primates as pets - written evidence from the RSPCA]]]The RSPCA greatly welcomes this inquiry. Keeping primates as pets is an issue the Society feels very strongly about and on which it has campaigned for many years. This inquiry is timely given that Defra’s Code of Practice for the Welfare of Privately-Kept Primates has been in place for almost three years and its effectiveness has yet to be reviewed. Due to the specialist, complex needs of primates and their capacity to suffer, the RSPCA believes that primates should not be kept as pets and that the current regulatory system is not working. Evidence shows that primates are easily obtained and somewhere in the region of 3,000-9,000 may be kept as pets in Great Britain. From the RSPCA’s experience, as well as that of specialist primate sanctuaries, welfare problems are widespread and serious. Regulations should be brought in to prohibit the keeping and trade of primates pets with the current population registered, and capped, to live out the rest of their lives with as high a level of welfare as possible.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

In addition, 82% of owners of UK ex-pet primates rehomed at the Monkey Sanctuary did not hold a licence for all or part of the animals’ lives.[4] Squirrel monkeys and tamarins, which comprised 33% of licensed species in 2005, were de-listed from the dWAA in 2007. It  was assumed they form a similar proportion of DWAA licensed primates kept in 2012. [5] TSPKA website http://www.tskaexotics.co.uk/page18.php accessed 25.11.08.[9] Greenwood et al.
