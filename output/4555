defaultSUPPLEMENTARY WRITTEN EVIDENCE BY DEFRA default&#xa0;defaultTHE EFRA ORAL SESSION ON 22defaultNDdefault OCTOBER 2013default&#xa0;defaultCorrection:default&#xa0;defaultDuring the hearing the Permanent Secretary stated that she thought the latest figure for the SPS cost per claim indicator for 
default20
default12/13 was £621 per claim. This figure is actually £691 per claim. 
default&#xa0;defaultQuestions raised: default&#xa0;defaultDetailed below are Defra’s responses to the questions raised at the Select Committee Hearing on 22nd October 2013 as detailed in the email from the Second Clerk. 
default&#xa0;
defaultEA staff costs – what are Other Staff related costs? How much of the £30 m increase to staff costs is covered by the additional funding for flood defences?default&#xa0;defaultOther staff related costs comprise primarily of staff allowances and pension contributions to the closed pension scheme. The contributions to the active pension scheme are categorised separately in note 3. The Agency intends to categorise the closed pension payments separately in the next ARA to enhance the reader’s understanding. The staff allowances include standby and call out payments for frontline staff relating to flood incident management. In addition, other staff costs include small 
defaultdiscretionary payments
default made to staff not entitled to overtime or unsociable hour payments in recognition of 
defaulttheir 
defaultsubstantial contributions made to incident management.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe £30m staff cost increase arose primarily 
defaultin the
default delivery of specialist frontline 
defaultnon flood 
defaultprojects, as well as flood incident management
default in 2012
default, with a lower proportion corresponding with the increased flood defence funding which was largely capital expenditure. 
defaultThis was funded through the additional budget provided to the Agency during the year.
default&#xa0;
defaultHow many Off-payroll staff does Defra still have, at what cost? default&#xa0;defaultWe assume that this question is related to the disclosure of the tax arrangements of public sector appointees, ARA page 37. The Treasury review of the tax arrangements of public sector appointees (published 23 May 2012) requested information from central government departments and their arm’s length bodies, in relation to all individuals engaged off payroll as of 31 January 2012, where the cost to the department is in excess of £58,200 per annum (the Senior Civil Service minimum).

defaultW
defaulthy has the cost of fees and commissions almost doubled? default&#xa0;defaultThe amount charged to administration costs in 2012-13 was £17m, 2011-12 £9m. This increase of £8m was mainly due to:-

defaultWhy did Defra make an additional payment to NuStar (£413,000) in 2012-13default&#xa0;
defaultThe original payment made reflected the outcome of the contractual

default between RPA and NuStar, which 
defaultwas formally settled at mediation under the terms of a full and final settlement. 
defaultA further special payment of
