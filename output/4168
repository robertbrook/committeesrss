[normal]Written evidence submitted by [bold]Teledwyr[bold] [bold]Annibynnol[bold] [bold]Cymru[bold] [FBB0069][bold]&#xa0;[bold]Summary[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction[bold] [bold]1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Teledwyr Annibynnol Cymru (TAC) is the trade association representing the interests of the Welsh independent production sector. 
[normal]Wales
[normal] has had an independent TV production sector since 1982, when Channel 4 and the Welsh language broadcaster S4C began broadcasting.
[normal] Today, w
[normal]ith over 40 companies turning over £
[normal]200
[normal]m
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] sector is 
[normal]now 
[normal]a thriving creative industry that makes a wide range of c
[normal]ontent – drama, 
[normal]factual, 
[normal]animation, music and entertainment, live events, current 
[normal]affairs
[normal],
[normal] lifestyle and so on. There is also an 
[normal]independent
[normal] radio production sector in 
[normal]Wales
[normal] 
[normal]producing for BBC Radio Wales and Radio 
[normal]Cymru
[normal].
[normal]2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Welsh producers make programmes 
[normal]not
[normal] only for BBC Wales and S4C but also for 
[normal]the UK
[normal]–wide channels
[normal],
[normal] for example
[normal]:
[normal] 
[normal]the award-winning 
[normal]‘
[normal]The Indian Doctor’ made for BBC1 by Rondo 
[normal]Media
[normal];
[normal] 
[normal]'Helicopter Rescue' by Cwmni Da was broadcast on network BBC1 after first broadcast on BBC Wales
[normal]; and ‘Arctic 
[normal]with Bruce Parry’ made by Indus Films for BBC2
[normal]; 
[normal]and
[normal] 
[normal]Telesgop’s ‘Turner and the Thames’ for BBC4.
[normal] 
[normal]Productions for 
[normal]UK
[normal] commercial PSBs include
[normal] 
[normal]Avanti’s documentary on 
[normal]Britain
[normal]’s Got Talent finalists Jonathan and 
[normal]Charlotte
[normal] for ITV1 and Rondo’s ‘My Tattoo Addiction’ for Channel 4.
[normal] 
[normal]Welsh producers are also working with companies overseas to create 
[normal]international co-productions
[normal].
[normal]3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The BBC clearly has an important part to play in 
[normal]Wales
[normal], as does fellow broadcaster S4C
[normal] which
[normal] 
[normal]since 2
[normal]01
[normal]3 
[normal]has mainly been funded by the Licence Fee. There are major decisions to be made in the 
[normal]next BBC 
[normal]Charter to ensure
[normal] that
[normal] public service 
[normal]broadcasting in 
[normal]Wales
[normal] continues to be diverse, vibrant and sufficiently well-funded to ensur
[normal]e that this 
[normal]UK
[normal] nation has 
[normal]a con
[normal]t
[normal]in
[normal]uing 
[normal]and thriving 
[normal]creative sector
[normal].  This sector must be
[normal] ab
[normal]l
[normal]e
[normal] to reflect
[normal] its voices
[normal], creative
[normal] talent a
[normal]nd stories to its own population 
[normal]and also 
[normal]to the rest of the 
[normal]UK
[normal] and beyond.
[normal]4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In this context TAC greatly welcomes the Committee’s decision to hold its inquiry into 
[normal]‘T
[normal]he Future of the BBC
[normal]’
[normal]. We 
[normal]hope 
[normal]that 
[normal]the Committee will find 
[normal]the
[normal] perspective and
[normal] proposals 
[normal]presented 
[normal]here of interest and would be grateful for the opportunity to appea
[normal]r before the committee to 
[normal]expand upon them
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]We will briefly address each of the Committee’s areas of interest, before turning to concentrate on the future of the Licence Fee and the BBC’s relationship with S4C.
[normal]Answers to the Committee’s Specific Question[bold]s[bold]What should the BBC be for and what should be the purpose of public service broadcasting?[bold]5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The BBC should continue to provide content which 
[normal]is
[normal] 
[normal]not easily 
[normal]available 
[normal]i
[normal]n the commercial space
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]and content
[normal] 
[normal]which adds creative competition to commercial 
[normal]broadcasting
[normal]. It 
[normal]plays a 
[normal]vital role 
[normal]in 
[normal]provid
[normal]ing
[normal] a wide range of challenging and enlightening content without which our society would be poorer.
[normal]How well has the BBC performed in the current Charter period in achieving its mission and public purposes?[bold]6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]BBC has provided a wide range of content 
[normal]and provided some exciting new services – the i-Player is an unqualified success, as 
[normal]is 
[normal]its news content and also 
[normal]its 
[normal]big audience items such as ‘Strictly’. A
[normal]lso,
[normal] its wildlife 
[normal]u
[normal]nit remains one of the best in the wor
[normal]ld. 
[normal]It continues to provide high quality and popular drama and high standard of current affairs and factual output. 
[normal]7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]H
[normal]owever while it has sought to increase production capacity in some areas outside London – eg Salford – it has not 
[normal]sufficiently 
[normal]maintained 
[normal]its commitment to the nations
[normal],
[normal] including Wales, w
[normal]here
[normal] budgets
[normal] have
[normal] decreas
[normal]ed significantly, 
[normal]with
[normal] significant reduction in budgets for services like Radio Cymru and Radio Wales (though 
[normal]a service like Radio 4 was 
[normal]exempt from such cuts
[normal] in the DQF
[normal]) and in the 
[normal]cost of provision of Welsh language content for S4C. 
[normal]Are the public purposes in the current Charter the right ones? How might they change?[bold]8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There should be a greater emphasis on encouraging 
[normal]UK
[normal] creativity and innovation, as well as greater diversity of content for 
[normal]L
[normal]icence Fee Payers
[normal], via ind
[normal]ependently produced content. 
[normal]What scope, scale and remit should the BBC have?[bold]Should the BBC’s output and services be provided to any greater or lesser degr[bold]ee for particular audiences?[bold]9.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The BBC should ensure that the nations of the 
[normal]UK
[normal] are having their stories told and lives reflected both in the
[normal]ir
[normal] own areas and across the 
[normal]UK
[normal]. 
[normal]Despite the BBC having a major drama cen
[normal]tre in 
[normal]Cardiff
[normal] 
[normal]Bay
[normal], there remain
[normal] very 
[normal]few programmes that are 
[normal]distinctively Welsh in character 
[normal]which are 
[normal]shown on the UK-wide BBC networks.  
[normal]Of equal importance is output and volume made in 
[normal]Wales
[normal] which has a UK-wide and international perspective and appeal. 
[normal]What balance should be struck in wh[bold]at the BBC produces in-house, commissions externally and leaves entirely to others to create?[bold]10.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Moving 
[normal] forward there will be an 
[normal]increasing 
[normal]need for the BBC to be flexible
[normal], whilst not allowing for 
[normal]itself to be outpaced by technological
[normal] advancements
[normal] and conve
[normal]rgence-related change. For this reason a BBC which is more slimline in structure, 
[normal]less bureaucratic and top heavy, 
[normal]with
[normal] a healthier balance between in-house and externally produced content
[normal] would make sense
[normal].  T
[normal]his will also allow it 
[normal]to 
[normal]provide a greater ran
[normal]ge of content to the 
[normal]Licence Fee Payer
[normal] and to better reflect audiences all around the 
[normal]UK
[normal].
[normal]11.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Committee will know that the UK TV production sector has benefitted greatly from interventions undertaken by previous governments, firstly to set up Channel 4 and
[normal] S4C as PSBs which, as publisher-broadcasters, commissioned wholly from the UK indie TV sector, and secondly introduced the 25% independent production quota. The addition of a Window of Creative Competition by the BBC 
[normal]in 200
[normal]7,
[normal] along with the protection of indie companies’ IP rights in the 2003 Communications Act, has resulted in a hugely successful international industry. It has also given the Licence F
[normal]e
[normal]e Payer access to a wider range of innovative ideas and fresh talent.
[normal]12.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]TAC w
[normal]as encouraged to hear BBC Creative Director Alan Yentob talk at the Edinburgh TV Festival in August of the possibility of the 50% in-house guarantee for BBC in-house producers being removed within five years. TAC hopes this reflects a general understanding
[normal] in the BBC that,
[normal] 
[normal]with TV indie producers winning between 75%-80% of commissions competed for by both in-house and indies, the way forward is to allow more such competition. A good next step might be
[normal] 
[normal]for BBC TV
[normal] to move to a 50% WoCC, and TAC would welcome 
[normal]such a recommendation being made by the Committee.
[normal]13.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]In radio, indie production has less scope, with only a 10% quota and additional 10% WoCC in operation. TAC’s producers involved in radio have noted that in the first year of its operation, the radio WoCC s
[normal]aw 80% of the hours on offer won by indie radio companies. This is a clear sign that BBC Radio could benefit from additional competition. TAC would therefore support the independent radio production sector in its call for a 25% quota and 25% WoCC to allow 
[normal]the sector to grow and provide more creative competition, again for the benefit of the Licence Fee Payer and the 
[normal]UK
[normal] economy.
[normal]How have the BBC’s commercial activities during the current Charter fitted with the BBC’s public purposes and have they achieved an[bold] adequate return for licence fee payers? What should be the aims, scope and scale of such activities beyond 2016?[bold]14.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]It is fair for the BBC to be able to maximise the value of the content it produces – revenue from international sales, secondary channel deals
[normal], DV
[normal]D
[normal]s
[normal],
[normal] downloads 
[normal]and so on 
[normal]can be used to increase the content budget. Of course the BBC should always have an eye to whether
[normal] or not
[normal] it is adversely affecting commercial organisations through 
[normal]such activity. It should also not use the fact that it owns the
[normal] IP to in-house produced content as a reason 
[normal]to restrict 
[normal]open
[normal]ing
[normal] up its commissioning to competition from independent producers.
[normal] The more successful and high-quality BBC programmes are, the more revenue they can sometimes generate, meaning everybody – the BBC, the indie producer and the Licence Fee Payer – benefits.
[normal]What role should the BBC play in developing technology and new way[bold]s of distributing content?[bold]15.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]It is important for the BBC to make sure it has its content 
[normal]on whatever platform the LF payer chooses to access it 
[normal]– eg online, on mobile 
[normal]and
[normal] so on. However in doing so it must always ensure it is allowing the producers of that c
[normal]ontent to benefit from the use of their intellectual property
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]How should the BBC be governed, regulated and held accountable beyond 2016?[bold]In a constantly evolving communications environment, does a 10-year Royal Charter and Agreement with the Secretary [bold]of State, together, provide the most appropriate constitutional framework for the BBC?[bold]16.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]As long as there is a fundamentally flexible nature to the BBC’s structure it should be able to deal with new changes and challenges within the current Charter system
[normal].
[normal]17.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]TAC believes it is very important for the Secretary of State to have ultimate responsibility for the Public Service broadcasters – for this reason we are unhappy with 
[normal]the BBC Trust ha
[normal]ving
[normal] the power to 
[normal]withdraw 
[normal]its 
[normal]f
[normal]unding of S4C
[normal] ‘in extremis’
[normal].
[normal] It is also o
[normal]ne of the reasons why the continued direct grant from DCMS to S4C is important, as this dual funding mechanism provides greater stability in terms of S4C preserving its editorial and operating independence. 
[normal]How should the BBC be funded beyond 2016?[bold] 
[normal]Is [bold]there a case for distributing funding for public service content more widely beyond the BBC?[bold]18.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]TAC’s opinion is that the TV Licence Fee has provided a very useful way of funding PSB broadcasting in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] in a way that has successfully augmented the commerci
[normal]al PSB services, in addition to the growing range of pay-channels.
[normal]19.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Whilst the landscape has undoubtedly changed, TAC still believes that the TV Licence Fee provides a
[normal] valuable and
[normal] unique way 
[normal]of
[normal] funding additional programming and services which is of benefit to the 
[normal]UK
[normal] citizen and
[normal] which
[normal] allows creative entrepreneurs to 
[normal]produce 
[normal]a wider and greater range of PSB content.
[normal]20.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Prior to the Comprehensive Spending Review in 2010, S4C 
[normal]had
[normal] an index-linked publ
[normal]ic grant from
[normal] t
[normal]h
[normal]e
[normal] Department for Culture 
[normal]Media
[normal] &amp; Sport. In 2010 this stood at just over £100m.
[normal] 
[normal]As part of the 2010 CSR, this arrangement was altered by the DCMS. The new arrangement meant that S4C had its budget reduced in real terms by some 36% - the main
[normal] part of its continuing funding was to come from the TV Licence Fee, with a remaining c£7m to be a continuing grant from DCMS. 
[normal]Its other 
[normal]sources
[normal] of funding are from 
[normal]advertising
[normal] and
[normal] from
[normal] programme and format sales, although it obviously shares 
[normal]the proceeds 
[normal]of
[normal] the latter with the 
[normal]independent
[normal] 
[normal]producers
[normal] who originate the content
[normal],
[normal] tale
[normal]nt and ideas
[normal].
[normal]21.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Sin
[normal]c
[normal]e this initial large cut, S4C has been subject to further cuts: 
[normal]a
[normal]s part of the Chancellor’s Autumn Statement in 2012, the DCMS announced a further round of 
[normal]funding reductions for S4C of 1% in 2013-14 and 2% in 2014-15. Following the Chancellor’s Spring Budget Statement in 2013 further cuts were announced of 1.09% in 2013-14 and 1.06% in 2014-15.
[normal] Lastly, the BBC Trust then included S4C’s non-content costs with
[normal]in the BBC’s own cost-cutting exercise. S4C’s budget 
[normal]was 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]effectively 
[normal]under attack 
[normal]from both the BBC Trust and the Government
[normal].
[normal]22.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]his situation caus
[normal]ed
[normal] difficulty in terms of S4C being able to plan ahead
[normal],
[normal] and commission content and services in the wa
[normal]y 
[normal]that other 
[normal]c
[normal]ommercial or PSB 
[normal] broadcasters
[normal] are able to do. 
[normal]TAC
[normal],
[normal] a
[normal]longside
[normal] 
[normal]several 
[normal]other
[normal] stakeholders and organisations, 
[normal]consistently argued
[normal] that
[normal] this 
[normal]constant
[normal] 
[normal]stream
[normal] of cuts should be ceased. 
[normal]As a result the DCMS announced in the CSR earlier this year that the Government grant to S4C would not be the subject of any further cuts 
[normal]until at least 2016
[normal]. 
[normal] Though a positive result in the short term, this h
[normal]owever
[normal] l
[normal]eaves
[normal] many 
[normal]unanswered
[normal] 
[normal]questions
[normal]: 
[normal]W
[normal]hat 
[normal]will happen to the 
[normal]Government
[normal] grant post-
[normal]2016
[normal]? How can
[normal] 
[normal]S4C be 
[normal]protected 
[normal]f
[normal]ro
[normal]m further cuts imposed on it by the BBC Trust, in the latter’s 
[normal]position
[normal] as ‘guardian of the Licence Fee’?
[normal]23.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]TAC also made a strong case regarding the Operating Agreement which 
[normal]defines
[normal] the new ‘partnership’ between the BBC and S4C. 
[normal]The
[normal] Agreement is between the BBC Trust and the S4C 
[normal]Authority
[normal], 
[normal]the
[normal] latter of which is the 
[normal]governing
[normal] body for S4C.
[normal]24.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Whilst several 
[normal]changes were
[normal] made to the Agreement which clarified the 
[normal]relationships
[normal] and further 
[normal]protected
[normal] S4C’s editorial
[normal], 
[normal]operational and 
[normal]managerial independence
[normal] 
[normal]some areas remained of concern,
[normal].  These included
[normal] t
[normal]he fact that, as stated above, the BBC Trust was inflicting upon another broadcaster cuts agreed by the Trust for the BBC spe
[normal]cifically
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]secondly, t
[normal]he power for the BBC Trust ‘in extremis’ to withdra
[normal]w 
[normal]its 
[normal]funding from S4C altogether. 
[normal]I
[normal]t is
[normal] TAC’s 
[normal]view
[normal] 
[normal]that
[normal] 
[normal]this 
[normal]power should 
[normal]ultimately 
[normal]lie with the 
[normal]sponsoring
[normal] Government 
[normal]d
[normal]epartment
[normal] – the Department for Culture, Media &amp; Sport
[normal], 
[normal]which also continues to provide funding for S4C
[normal] 
[normal]&#xad;
[normal]– alongside the statutory duty to ensure sufficient funding for S4C, which is included in the Public Bodies Act
[normal].
[normal]25.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]S4C is a unique broadcaster and not 
[normal]in any way 
[normal]part of the BBC
[normal]. 
[normal]It plays a unique role in the everyday lives of the people of 
[normal]Wales
[normal] as well as making a progressive and key contribution to 
[normal]Wales
[normal], its economy, and the Welsh language.  
[normal]Its publisher-broadcaster model means 
[normal]that 
[normal]it commissions all of its content externally
[normal], from 
[normal]the
[normal] Welsh independent production sector. 
[normal]It also has a remit of its own to commission programming that meets with the unique requirements and taste of a particular audience namely the people of 
[normal]Wales
[normal], be they fluent Welsh speakers, learners or those
[normal] who aspire to learn
[normal] the language
[normal].  This includes high-level content focusing, issues of great concern to the people of Wales, from the Welsh language to heritage, culture and music, Wales’ agricultural heritage as well as factual programmes,
[normal] sport,
[normal] high-q
[normal]uality drama or reflecting the issues specific to different parts of Wales.  
[normal]It provides invaluable and unique provision for children – 
[normal]from pre-school to teenagers 
[normal](content originated and produced in 
[normal]Wales
[normal]) and it also provides content for Welsh language 
[normal]learners. As a national broadcaster it has been vital in enabling a creative sector to be based all around 
[normal]Wales
[normal] – in the capital city 
[normal]Cardiff
[normal] and also in Caernarfon, in 
[normal]Swansea
[normal] and in Llanelli. 
[normal]26.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Committee will be 
[normal]a
[normal]ware that one of the arguments in fav
[normal]our of a number of PSB and commercial broadcasters is that 
[normal]UK
[normal] citizens 
[normal]are provided 
[normal]with
[normal] a richer and 
[normal]more
[normal] diverse range of content thanks to this plurality 
[normal]combined
[normal] with stated public purposes.
[normal]27.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Therefore it is 
[normal]important
[normal] that 
[normal]Wales
[normal] as a nation with its own
[normal] language and cultur
[normal]e
[normal] 
[normal](
[normal]but which sits within the
[normal] wider 
[normal]UK
[normal])
[normal] should have a 
[normal]plurality
[normal] 
[normal]of
[normal] 
[normal]broadcasters
[normal]. 
[normal]It is also important for the 
[normal]continuing
[normal] 
[normal]growth
[normal] 
[normal]of the
[normal] 
[normal]UK
[normal] creative 
[normal]sector
[normal] as a whole. 
[normal]Having a production sector in 
[normal]Wales
[normal], and encouraging 
[normal]Wales
[normal] to have its own outlook and stories t
[normal]o
[normal] tell, is a reason why 
[normal]Wales
[normal] has been able to pr
[normal]oduce 
[normal]Y Gwyll / Hinterland
[normal]. T
[normal]his drama series, which has
[normal] met with much critical acclaim
[normal], made use of Welsh cultural touchstones as well as the unique landscape
[normal] in and ar
[normal]ound Aberystwyth
[normal] to make compelling television that 
[normal]is already
[normal] succeed
[normal]ing
[normal] internationally as well in the rest of the 
[normal]UK
[normal].
[normal] A second series has already been commissioned on the back of the success of the first
[normal]. 
[normal]28.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Co-produced by the Fiction Factory with S4C, 
[normal]Tinopolis, the S4C co-production fund and All3Media International
[normal], Y
[normal] 
[normal]Gwyll
[normal] has already produced strong audience numbers on S4C and this will grow when it is aired on BBC Four and BBC Cymru Wales in 2014. Its 
[normal]high
[normal] quality
[normal], reminiscent of shows such as 
[normal]The K
[normal]illing
[normal], has been demonstrated by the fact that the Danish network which was responsible for The Killing has bought the series to show on its own network. 
[normal]29.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]As an 
[normal]independent
[normal] 
[normal]broadcasting
[normal] 
[normal]organisation
[normal], which simply 
[normal]happens
[normal] to share the 
[normal]same
[normal] funding source as the BBC, S4C’s
[normal] 
[normal]budget should not automatically be cut every time the BBC reduces costs across its service
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]S4C has its own business model 
[normal]and
[normal] needs to have the 
[normal]independence
[normal] of management and security of funding to be able to deliver it 
[normal]effectively.
[normal]30.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]TAC 
[normal]considers
[normal] it essential that:
[normal]31.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]If the plurality of Welsh PSB broadcasting, along 
[normal]with the Welsh language and the independent production sector are to be allowed to flourish, the above measures are essential. If it is not possible within the current arrangement to ensure this editorial and operational independence, TAC believes that the
[normal] Committee should examine whether or not it would be preferable to allocate a specific proportion of the TV Licence Fee directly to S4C, entirely separately from the Licence Fee money that is the 
[normal]responsibility of the BBC Trust. This would have the added a
[normal]dvantage of restoring full operational and managerial independence to S4C.
[normal]32.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]TAC is very aware of the contrasting arguments on the merits of such 'top-slicing’ and is not necessarily saying it would support this proposal as a first option, but it is importan
[normal]t to make sure above all else that S4C continues to be able to operate effectively as a separate entity with sufficient guaranteed funding to fulfil its objectives.
[normal] 
[normal]If it cannot do so within the current arrangement then 
[normal]other arrangements including top-sli
[normal]cing the Licence Fee ought to be considered
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]33.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]A plurality of broadcasting is as important in 
[normal]Wales
[normal] as it is elsewhere. S4C also contributes greatly to the Welsh economy – an independent report published earlier this year showed that every pound spent in th
[normal]e Welsh creative industries generated nearly £2 worth of economic growth
[normal]. S4C provides high-quality programmes unique in its character and content. It must not be allowed to be damaged by the lack of a sustainable funding arrangement or risk of losing its
[normal] editorial and managerial independence.
