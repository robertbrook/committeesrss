default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTeledwyr Annibynnol Cymru (TAC) is the trade association representing the interests of the Welsh independent production sector. 
defaultWales
default has had an independent TV production sector since 1982, when Channel 4 and the Welsh language broadcaster S4C began broadcasting.
default Today, w
defaultith over 40 companies turning over £
default200
defaultm
default,
default 
defaultthe
default sector is 
defaultnow 
defaulta thriving creative industry that makes a wide range of c
defaultontent – drama, 
defaultfactual, 
defaultanimation, music and entertainment, live events, current 
defaultaffairs
default,
default lifestyle and so on. There is also an 
defaultindependent
default radio production sector in 
defaultWales
default 
defaultproducing for BBC Radio Wales and Radio 
defaultCymru
default.
default2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWelsh producers make programmes 
defaultnot
default only for BBC Wales and S4C but also for 
defaultthe UK
default–wide channels
default,
default for example
default:
default 
defaultthe award-winning 
default‘
defaultThe Indian Doctor’ made for BBC1 by Rondo 
defaultMedia
default;
default 
default'Helicopter Rescue' by Cwmni Da was broadcast on network BBC1 after first broadcast on BBC Wales
default; and ‘Arctic 
defaultwith Bruce Parry’ made by Indus Films for BBC2
default; 
defaultand
default 
defaultTelesgop’s ‘Turner and the Thames’ for BBC4.
default 
defaultProductions for 
defaultUK
default commercial PSBs include
default 
defaultAvanti’s documentary on 
defaultBritain
default’s Got Talent finalists Jonathan and 
defaultCharlotte
default for ITV1 and Rondo’s ‘My Tattoo Addiction’ for Channel 4.
default 
defaultWelsh producers are also working with companies overseas to create 
defaultinternational co-productions
default.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe BBC clearly has an important part to play in 
defaultWales
default, as does fellow broadcaster S4C
default which
default 
defaultsince 2
default01

defaulthas mainly been funded by the Licence Fee. There are major decisions to be made in the 
defaultnext BBC 
defaultCharter to ensure
default that
default public service 
defaultbroadcasting in 
defaultWales
default continues to be diverse, vibrant and sufficiently well-funded to ensur
defaulte that this 
defaultUK
default nation has 
defaulta con
defaultt
defaultin
defaultuing 
defaultand thriving 
defaultcreative sector
default.  This sector must be
default ab
defaultl
defaulte
default to reflect
default its voices
default, creative
default talent a
defaultnd stories to its own population 
defaultand also 
defaultto the rest of the 
defaultUK
default and beyond.
default4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn this context TAC greatly welcomes the Committee’s decision to hold its inquiry into 
default‘T
defaulthe Future of the BBC
default’
default. We 
defaulthope 
defaultthat 
defaultthe Committee will find 
defaultthe
default perspective and
default proposals 
defaultpresented 
defaulthere of interest and would be grateful for the opportunity to appea
defaultr before the committee to 
defaultexpand upon them
default.
default 
default 
defaultWe will briefly address each of the Committee’s areas of interest, before turning to concentrate on the future of the Licence Fee and the BBC’s relationship with S4C.
defaultAnswers to the Committee’s Specific QuestiondefaultsdefaultWhat should the BBC be for and what should be the purpose of public service broadcasting?default5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe BBC should continue to provide content which 
defaultis
default 
defaultnot easily 
defaultavailable 
defaulti
defaultn the commercial space
default,
default 
defaultand content
default 
defaultwhich adds creative competition to commercial 
defaultbroadcasting
default. It 
defaultplays a 
defaultvital role 
defaultin 
defaultprovid
defaulting
default a wide range of challenging and enlightening content without which our society would be poorer.
defaultHow well has the BBC performed in the current Charter period in achieving its mission and public purposes?default6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultBBC has provided a wide range of content 
defaultand provided some exciting new services – the i-Player is an unqualified success, as 
defaultis 
defaultits news content and also 
defaultits 
defaultbig audience items such as ‘Strictly’. A
defaultlso,
default its wildlife 
defaultu
defaultnit remains one of the best in the wor
defaultld. 
defaultIt continues to provide high quality and popular drama and high standard of current affairs and factual output. 
default7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultH
defaultowever while it has sought to increase production capacity in some areas outside London – eg Salford – it has not 
defaultsufficiently 
defaultmaintained 
defaultits commitment to the nations
default,
default including Wales, w
defaulthere
default budgets
default have
default decreas
defaulted significantly, 
defaultwith
default significant reduction in budgets for services like Radio Cymru and Radio Wales (though 
defaulta service like Radio 4 was 
defaultexempt from such cuts
default in the DQF
default) and in the 
defaultcost of provision of Welsh language content for S4C. 
defaultAre the public purposes in the current Charter the right ones? How might they change?default8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere should be a greater emphasis on encouraging 
defaultUK
default creativity and innovation, as well as greater diversity of content for 
defaultL
defaulticence Fee Payers
default, via ind
defaultependently produced content. 
defaultWhat scope, scale and remit should the BBC have?defaultShould the BBC’s output and services be provided to any greater or lesser degrdefaultee for particular audiences?default9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe BBC should ensure that the nations of the 
defaultUK
default are having their stories told and lives reflected both in the
defaultir
default own areas and across the 
defaultUK
default. 
defaultDespite the BBC having a major drama cen
defaulttre in 
defaultCardiff
default 
defaultBay
default, there remain
default very 
defaultfew programmes that are 
defaultdistinctively Welsh in character 
defaultwhich are 
defaultshown on the UK-wide BBC networks.  
defaultOf equal importance is output and volume made in 
defaultWales
default which has a UK-wide and international perspective and appeal. 
defaultWhat balance should be struck in whdefaultat the BBC produces in-house, commissions externally and leaves entirely to others to create?default10.
default&#xa0; 
defaultMoving 
default forward there will be an 
defaultincreasing 
defaultneed for the BBC to be flexible
default, whilst not allowing for 
defaultitself to be outpaced by technological
default advancements
default and conve
defaultrgence-related change. For this reason a BBC which is more slimline in structure, 
defaultless bureaucratic and top heavy, 
defaultwith
default a healthier balance between in-house and externally produced content
default would make sense
default.  T
defaulthis will also allow it 
defaultto 
defaultprovide a greater ran
defaultge of content to the 
defaultLicence Fee Payer
default and to better reflect audiences all around the 
defaultUK
default.
default11.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Committee will know that the UK TV production sector has benefitted greatly from interventions undertaken by previous governments, firstly to set up Channel 4 and
default S4C as PSBs which, as publisher-broadcasters, commissioned wholly from the UK indie TV sector, and secondly introduced the 25% independent production quota. The addition of a Window of Creative Competition by the BBC 
defaultin 200
default7,
default along with the protection of indie companies’ IP rights in the 2003 Communications Act, has resulted in a hugely successful international industry. It has also given the Licence F
defaulte
defaulte Payer access to a wider range of innovative ideas and fresh talent.
default12.
default&#xa0; 
defaultTAC w
defaultas encouraged to hear BBC Creative Director Alan Yentob talk at the Edinburgh TV Festival in August of the possibility of the 50% in-house guarantee for BBC in-house producers being removed within five years. TAC hopes this reflects a general understanding
default in the BBC that,
default 
defaultwith TV indie producers winning between 75%-80% of commissions competed for by both in-house and indies, the way forward is to allow more such competition. A good next step might be
default 
defaultfor BBC TV
default to move to a 50% WoCC, and TAC would welcome 
defaultsuch a recommendation being made by the Committee.
default13.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn radio, indie production has less scope, with only a 10% quota and additional 10% WoCC in operation. TAC’s producers involved in radio have noted that in the first year of its operation, the radio WoCC s
defaultaw 80% of the hours on offer won by indie radio companies. This is a clear sign that BBC Radio could benefit from additional competition. TAC would therefore support the independent radio production sector in its call for a 25% quota and 25% WoCC to allow 
defaultthe sector to grow and provide more creative competition, again for the benefit of the Licence Fee Payer and the 
defaultUK
default economy.
defaultHow have the BBC’s commercial activities during the current Charter fitted with the BBC’s public purposes and have they achieved andefault adequate return for licence fee payers? What should be the aims, scope and scale of such activities beyond 2016?default14.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt is fair for the BBC to be able to maximise the value of the content it produces – revenue from international sales, secondary channel deals
default, DV
defaultD
defaults
default,
default downloads 
defaultand so on 
defaultcan be used to increase the content budget. Of course the BBC should always have an eye to whether
default or not
default it is adversely affecting commercial organisations through 
defaultsuch activity. It should also not use the fact that it owns the
default IP to in-house produced content as a reason 
defaultto restrict 
defaultopen
defaulting
default up its commissioning to competition from independent producers.
default The more successful and high-quality BBC programmes are, the more revenue they can sometimes generate, meaning everybody – the BBC, the indie producer and the Licence Fee Payer – benefits.
defaultWhat role should the BBC play in developing technology and new waydefaults of distributing content?default15.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt is important for the BBC to make sure it has its content 
defaulton whatever platform the LF payer chooses to access it 
default– eg online, on mobile 
defaultand
default so on. However in doing so it must always ensure it is allowing the producers of that c
defaultontent to benefit from the use of their intellectual property
default.
default 
defaultHow should the BBC be governed, regulated and held accountable beyond 2016?defaultIn a constantly evolving communications environment, does a 10-year Royal Charter and Agreement with the Secretary defaultof State, together, provide the most appropriate constitutional framework for the BBC?default16.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAs long as there is a fundamentally flexible nature to the BBC’s structure it should be able to deal with new changes and challenges within the current Charter system
default.
default17.
default&#xa0; 
defaultTAC believes it is very important for the Secretary of State to have ultimate responsibility for the Public Service broadcasters – for this reason we are unhappy with 
defaultthe BBC Trust ha
defaultving
default the power to 
defaultwithdraw 
defaultits 
defaultf
defaultunding of S4C
default ‘in extremis’
default.
default It is also o
defaultne of the reasons why the continued direct grant from DCMS to S4C is important, as this dual funding mechanism provides greater stability in terms of S4C preserving its editorial and operating independence. 
defaultHow should the BBC be funded beyond 2016?default 
defaultIs defaultthere a case for distributing funding for public service content more widely beyond the BBC?default18.
default&#xa0; 
defaultTAC’s opinion is that the TV Licence Fee has provided a very useful way of funding PSB broadcasting in the 
defaultUK
default in a way that has successfully augmented the commerci
defaultal PSB services, in addition to the growing range of pay-channels.
default19.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWhilst the landscape has undoubtedly changed, TAC still believes that the TV Licence Fee provides a
default valuable and
default unique way 
defaultof
default funding additional programming and services which is of benefit to the 
defaultUK
default citizen and
default which
default allows creative entrepreneurs to 
defaultproduce 
defaulta wider and greater range of PSB content.
default20.
default&#xa0; 
defaultPrior to the Comprehensive Spending Review in 2010, S4C 
defaulthad
default an index-linked publ
defaultic grant from
default t
defaulth
defaulte
default Department for Culture 
defaultMedia
default &amp; Sport. In 2010 this stood at just over £100m.
default 
defaultAs part of the 2010 CSR, this arrangement was altered by the DCMS. The new arrangement meant that S4C had its budget reduced in real terms by some 36% - the main
default part of its continuing funding was to come from the TV Licence Fee, with a remaining c£7m to be a continuing grant from DCMS. 
defaultIts other 
defaultsources
default of funding are from 
defaultadvertising
default and
default from
default programme and format sales, although it obviously shares 
defaultthe proceeds 
defaultof
default the latter with the 
defaultindependent
default 
defaultproducers
default who originate the content
default,
default tale
defaultnt and ideas
default.
default21.
default&#xa0; 
defaultSin
defaultc
defaulte this initial large cut, S4C has been subject to further cuts: 
defaulta
defaults part of the Chancellor’s Autumn Statement in 2012, the DCMS announced a further round of 
defaultfunding reductions for S4C of 1% in 2013-14 and 2% in 2014-15. Following the Chancellor’s Spring Budget Statement in 2013 further cuts were announced of 1.09% in 2013-14 and 1.06% in 2014-15.
default Lastly, the BBC Trust then included S4C’s non-content costs with
defaultin the BBC’s own cost-cutting exercise. S4C’s budget 
defaultwas 
defaulttherefore 
defaulteffectively 
defaultunder attack 
defaultfrom both the BBC Trust and the Government
default.
default22.
default&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthis situation caus
defaulted
default difficulty in terms of S4C being able to plan ahead
default,
default and commission content and services in the wa
defaulty 
defaultthat other 
defaultc
defaultommercial or PSB 
default broadcasters
default are able to do. 
defaultTAC
default,
default a
defaultlongside
default 
defaultseveral 
defaultother
default stakeholders and organisations, 
defaultconsistently argued
default that
default this 
defaultconstant
default 
defaultstream
default of cuts should be ceased. 
defaultAs a result the DCMS announced in the CSR earlier this year that the Government grant to S4C would not be the subject of any further cuts 
defaultuntil at least 2016
default. 
default Though a positive result in the short term, this h
defaultowever
default l
defaulteaves
default many 
defaultunanswered
default 
defaultquestions
default: 
defaultW
defaulthat 
defaultwill happen to the

default? How can
default 
defaultS4C be 
defaultprotected 
defaultf
defaultro
defaultm further cuts imposed on it by the BBC Trust, in the latter’s 
defaultposition
default as ‘guardian of the Licence Fee’?
default23.
default&#xa0; 
defaultTAC also made a strong case regarding the Operating Agreement which 
defaultdefines
default the new ‘partnership’ between the BBC and S4C. 
defaultThe
default Agreement is between the BBC Trust and the S4C 
defaultAuthority
default, 
defaultthe
default latter of which is the 
defaultgoverning
default body for S4C.
default24.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWhilst several 
defaultchanges were
default made to the Agreement which clarified the 
defaultrelationships
default and further 
defaultprotected
default S4C’s editorial
default, 
defaultoperational and 
defaultmanagerial independence
default 
defaultsome areas remained of concern,
default.  These included
default t
defaulthe fact that, as stated above, the BBC Trust was inflicting upon another broadcaster cuts agreed by the Trust for the BBC spe
defaultcifically
default 
defaultand 
defaultsecondly, t
defaulthe power for the BBC Trust ‘in extremis’ to withdra
defaultw 
defaultits 
defaultfunding from S4C altogether. 
defaultI
defaultt is
default TAC’s 
defaultview
default 
defaultthat
default 
defaultthis 
defaultpower should 
defaultultimately 
defaultlie with the 
defaultsponsoring
default Government 
defaultd
defaultepartment
default – the Department for Culture, Media &amp; Sport
default, 
defaultwhich also continues to provide funding for S4C
default 
default&#xad;
default– alongside the statutory duty to ensure sufficient funding for S4C, which is included in the Public Bodies Act
default.
default25.
default&#xa0; 
defaultS4C is a unique broadcaster and not 
defaultin any way 
defaultpart of the BBC
default. 
defaultIt plays a unique role in the everyday lives of the people of 
defaultWales
default as well as making a progressive and key contribution to 
defaultWales
default, its economy, and the Welsh language.  
defaultIts publisher-broadcaster model means 
defaultthat 
defaultit commissions all of its content externally
default, from 
defaultthe
default Welsh independent production sector. 
defaultIt also has a remit of its own to commission programming that meets with the unique requirements and taste of a particular audience namely the people of 
defaultWales
default, be they fluent Welsh speakers, learners or those
default who aspire to learn
default the language
default.  This includes high-level content focusing, issues of great concern to the people of Wales, from the Welsh language to heritage, culture and music, Wales’ agricultural heritage as well as factual programmes,
default sport,
default high-q
defaultuality drama or reflecting the issues specific to different parts of Wales.  
defaultIt provides invaluable and unique provision for children – 
defaultfrom pre-school to teenagers 
default(content originated and produced in 
defaultWales
default) and it also provides content for Welsh language 
defaultlearners. As a national broadcaster it has been vital in enabling a creative sector to be based all around 
defaultWales
default – in the capital city 
defaultCardiff
default and also in Caernarfon, in 
defaultSwansea
default and in Llanelli. 
default26.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Committee will be 
defaulta
defaultware that one of the arguments in fav
defaultour of a number of PSB and commercial broadcasters is that 
defaultUK
default citizens 
defaultare provided 
defaultwith
default a richer and 
defaultmore
default diverse range of content thanks to this plurality 
defaultcombined
default with stated public purposes.
default27.
default&#xa0; 
defaultTherefore it is 
defaultimportant
default that 
defaultWales
default as a nation with its own
default language and cultur
defaulte
default 
default(
defaultbut which sits within the
default wider 
defaultUK
default)
default should have a 
defaultplurality
default 
defaultof
default 
defaultbroadcasters
default. 
defaultIt is also important for the 
defaultcontinuing
default 
defaultgrowth
default 
defaultof the
default 
defaultUK
default creative 
defaultsector
default as a whole. 
defaultHaving a production sector in 
defaultWales
default, and encouraging 
defaultWales
default to have its own outlook and stories t
defaulto
default tell, is a reason why 
defaultWales
default has been able to pr
defaultoduce 
defaultY Gwyll / Hinterland
default. T
defaulthis drama series, which has
default met with much critical acclaim
default, made use of Welsh cultural touchstones as well as the unique landscape
default in and ar
defaultound Aberystwyth
default to make compelling television that 
defaultis already
default succeed
defaulting
default internationally as well in the rest of the 
defaultUK
default.
default A second series has already been commissioned on the back of the success of the first
default. 
default28.
default&#xa0; 
defaultCo-produced by the Fiction Factory with S4C, 
defaultTinopolis, the S4C co-production fund and All3Media International
default, Y
default 
defaultGwyll
default has already produced strong audience numbers on S4C and this will grow when it is aired on BBC Four and BBC Cymru Wales in 2014. Its 
defaulthigh
default quality
default, reminiscent of shows such as 
defaultThe K
defaultilling
default, has been demonstrated by the fact that the Danish network which was responsible for The Killing has bought the series to show on its own network. 
default29.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAs an 
defaultindependent
default 
defaultbroadcasting
default 
defaultorganisation
default, which simply 
defaulthappens
default to share the 
defaultsame
default funding source as the BBC, S4C’s
default 
defaultbudget should not automatically be cut every time the BBC reduces costs across its service
default. 
default 
defaultS4C has its own business model 
defaultand
default needs to have the 
defaultindependence
default of management and security of funding to be able to deliver it 
defaulteffectively.
default30.
default&#xa0; 
defaultTAC 
defaultconsiders
default it essential that:
default31.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIf the plurality of Welsh PSB broadcasting, along 
defaultwith the Welsh language and the independent production sector are to be allowed to flourish, the above measures are essential. If it is not possible within the current arrangement to ensure this editorial and operational independence, TAC believes that the
default Committee should examine whether or not it would be preferable to allocate a specific proportion of the TV Licence Fee directly to S4C, entirely separately from the Licence Fee money that is the 
defaultresponsibility of the BBC Trust. This would have the added a
defaultdvantage of restoring full operational and managerial independence to S4C.
default32.
default&#xa0; 
defaultTAC is very aware of the contrasting arguments on the merits of such 'top-slicing’ and is not necessarily saying it would support this proposal as a first option, but it is importan
defaultt to make sure above all else that S4C continues to be able to operate effectively as a separate entity with sufficient guaranteed funding to fulfil its objectives.
default 
defaultIf it cannot do so within the current arrangement then 
defaultother arrangements including top-sli
defaultcing the Licence Fee ought to be considered
default.
default 
default33.
default&#xa0; 
defaultA plurality of broadcasting is as important in 
defaultWales
default as it is elsewhere. S4C also contributes greatly to the Welsh economy – an independent report published earlier this year showed that every pound spent in th
defaulte Welsh creative industries generated nearly £2 worth of economic growth
default. S4C provides high-quality programmes unique in its character and content. It must not be allowed to be damaged by the lack of a sustainable funding arrangement or risk of losing its
default editorial and managerial independence.
