[[[CECA Briefing:]]]Benefits of Forward Visibility of Local Government InvestmentThe following short paper has been prepared to follow up on evidence given by Alasdair Reisner, director of external affairs at the Civil Engineering Contractors Association, on 4 November 2013 to the Communities and Local Government Committee as part of its inquiry into local government procurement. As part of his evidence, Mr Reisner had indicated that significant benefits might arise where greater forward visibility is available in terms of future investment by local authorities. The Committee asked for details about what these benefits might be. This paper seeks to articulate how and where these benefits will arise. The Civil Engineering Contractors Association believes that the following points cover the key benefits associated with pipeline visibility. 

[[[Better resource allocation ]]]By developing an understanding of likely demand, suppliers can invest intelligently in plant and equipment, allocating often limited resources to those areas that will best position the supplier to respond to these demands. 

[[[Improved skills /recruitment management ]]]With greater visibility suppliers would be able to invest in the skills that their workforce will need to meet future demand. Equally recruitment can be focussed upon those whose skills will be required for this future work. 

[[[More stable workforce ]]]With a better understanding of both the amount and types of future workload, suppliers can manage their workforce better. This reduces occurrence of the problems of ‘hot markets’ where in demand skills lead to poaching, while also cutting back on the need for large scale and costly redundancies when workload falls back. 

[[[Ability to enter into long-term purchase agreements ]]]Current short-term visibility of investment programmes mean that both clients and suppliers may not have the confidence to enter into long-term purchase agreements for commodities and services, as it is impossible to predict future demand. Were greater clarity available, such agreements could be established, lowering unit costs and therefore delivering greater efficiency.

[[[Encourage innovation]]]The construction industry would benefit if it were quicker to develop new solutions and products to improve quality and reduce cost. Part of the reason that such innovation currently does not take place is a lack of clarity over whether investment in research and development would pay dividends through sales of the resulting improved products and services. With greater pipeline transparency, suppliers could have more confidence to invest in such research based on the likely future market for the results of this innovation. &#xa0;

[[[Early identification of feast/famine situations (regional, sector, specialism/procurement or delivery) ]]]Prior to the recent downturn, there was considerable evidence that a major driver of escalating costs was the issue of workload shortages and surpluses. As noted above, shortfalls lead suppliers to lay off staff and shut operations, while work surpluses lead to spiralling costs due to resource shortages. Greater forward visibility of programme would help identify where there are likely to be excesses of demand or supply (whether this be in a region, a sector or specialism either at procurement stage or during delivery) allowing programming to be modified to mitigate this effect. 

[[[More effective response to procurement ]]]Poor procurement practices contribute to significantly reduced efficiency in construction. Often procurement takes place to a timetable that leaves the industry little time to respond. If suppliers had greater notice of when procurement would take place, they would respond by ensuring bid teams were in place and adequately resourced, producing more competent bids that will lead to more effective delivery on site. 

[[[Create opportunities for collaborative procurement ]]]By creating visibility of the forward construction pipeline, clients can identify (either within their organisation or across the industry) opportunities for bundling of projects to drive greater efficiency. 

[[[Ability for suppliers to make early business decisions ]]]An early understanding of the specification of a project provides a supplier with the opportunity to decide early on whether or not to put resources behind targeting a specific opportunity. Those suppliers that do so will be better placed to respond to the work when it comes to the market, while by taking the early decision suppliers who decide to avoid a project will save on the costs of tracking projects that turn out to be non-starters. 

[[[Foster environment for greater early supply chain engagement ]]]Early certainty about a given project opens up the opportunity for a client to seek guidance on its development from the supply chain, either formally through an Early Contractor Involvement-style contractual approach, or through early market engagement (workshops/seminars). Such an approach has repeatedly been identified by suppliers as a key driver of greater efficiency. 

[[[Support the development of integrated teams ]]]As well as early engagement, early visibility will also help suppliers to identify projects where they will be asked to work together in integrated teams. If this information is available early, it will afford a greater opportunity for supply chain members to consider who they might wish to work with, allowing them to establish robust integrated teams with adequate notice prior to competition. 

[[[Early identification of project pitfalls ]]]Through early visibility and engagement with the supply chain, the industry can use their experience to offer guidance on potential problems with the ‘buildability’ of projects, which may not have been apparent to the client team.
