"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written evidence from the National Federation of Retail Newsagents (NFRN) (CYS0121)&#xa0;Introduction&#xa0;1. The National Federation of Retail Newsagents \n(NFRN) would like to thank the c\nommittee for the invitation to \nmake a \nwritten submission on\n the issue of\n \ncycling safety\n.\n&#xa0;2. The NFRN is one of Europe’s largest trade associations, representing over 16,000 fee paying members from approximately 18,000 independent newsagents and convenience stores across the UK, Channel Island\ns and the Republic of Ireland. We are a membership led organisation that is democratically structured; policy is made by annual conference and its implementation is overseen by National Council.\n&#xa0;\n3. The NFRN assis\nts the independent retailer to \ncompete more\n effectively in today’s highly competitive market through the provision of practical help and assistance, commercial support, deals and buying opportunities, t\nraining, expertise and services. I\nt also represents its members’ interests at governmental and pa\nrliamentary level, as well as within the news and magazine industry. \n&#xa0;\nGeneral Remarks&#xa0;4. Cycling safety is an issue\n that is\n very\n important to the NFRN as a\n \nmajority\n of our members’ \nnews\npaper deliverers use a bicycle to undertake their work.\n&#xa0;\n5. \nT\nhe NFRN \nhas decided to \nissue a submission\n to the enquiry on the basis that one of the proposals could impact negatively on the businesses of our members.\n&#xa0;\n5. \nTherefore t\nhis submission will focus solely on the following term of reference:\n&#xa0;\n- \n \nWhether it would be \ndesirable and feasible to segregate cyclists from other road users, including, for example, by prohibiting HGVs from entering city centres at peak hours.\n&#xa0;\nDeclaration of Interest&#xa0;6. \nWhile many\n of the NFRN’s members employ newspaper deliverers who use bicy\ncles to undertake their work, we\n do not have any\n further\n links\n or connections\n with \nthe \ncycling industry. \n&#xa0;Whether it would be desirable and feasible to segregate cyclists from other road users, including, for example, by prohibiting HGVs from entering city centres at peak hours.&#xa0;\n7. \nWhile ensuring the safety of cyclists is of paramount importance, the\n NFRN urges the committee to consider the impact HGV prohibition during \n‘\nrush hour\n’\n would have on \nbusinesses.\n \n&#xa0;\n8. Our members \nand their suppliers may be \nseriously disadvantaged if deliveries are not able to be made or take longer as smaller vehicles have to be used.\n9. Independent newsagents and convenience stores are already struggling in the difficult financial climate and with the competition from large\n supermarkets. If their suppliers are unable to receive their deliveries on time, or the size of their deliveries is reduced, this will have a knock on effect for small businesses and their product availability. \n&#xa0;\n10.\n While cycling safety is a matter of hi\ngh importance, it is\n doubtful as to whether the proposal would improve cycling safety. The Freight Transport Association raises the point that one HGV will have to be replaced with approximately eight vans. As a consequence, this would actually \nincrease co\nngestion on the roads and provide a further risk to both the safety of cyclists and the levels of pollution\n.\n&#xa0;\n11. Consequently, the NFRN does not feel that this is a sensible or practical proposal that should be implemented\n as it undermines businesses without improving cycling safety\n.\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.fta.co.uk/media_and_campaigns/press_releases/2013/20131121_hgv__ban_is_not_the_solution_claims_fta.html\n \n"
