defaultQUESTIONS FOLLOWING HOME AFFAIRS SELECT COMMITTEE ON 12 NOVEMBER 2013default&#xa0;
default1. Thank you for your letter of 15 November 2013. As far as possible I have set out below the information you requested with additional information requested by Eleanor Scarnell on 18 November. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMohammed Ahmed Mohamed case chronology default2. A case chronology of Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed including his Control Order and TPIM breaches is attached at Annex A. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMohamed’s civil claim for damages default3. Mohamed alleges that he was not detained in accordance with Somaliland law; that he was mistreated at the time of his arrest and when in detention; and that he was deported to the UK without due process. He claims the UK was unlawfully involved in this. As this matter is the subject of ongoing civil litigation I cannot comment on the issue at this stage beyond saying that the Government has denied any wrongdoing or unlawful acts. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTPIM breaches and prosecutions default4. Ms Scarnell asked for details of TPIM breaches and prosecutions. Six people have been charged with breaching their TPIM notices, some more than once: 
default&#xa0;
defaultMohamed himself was charged on two separate occasions – in December 2012 with six counts of failing to report to the police station or reporting late (awaiting trial at time of abscond) and in July 2013 with one count of tampering with his tag (case discontinued after CPS concluded there was no realistic prospect of conviction). As noted in Annex A, he was also charged with 14 counts of breaching his Control Order. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOne person pleaded guilty to three counts of breaching - broadcasting without permission, attending a meeting or gathering without permission and entering an internet cafe without permission. He was sentenced to nine months imprisonment on 21 June 2013. Charges in relation to a further three counts were allowed to lie on file following his guilty plea. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOne person was charged with five counts of entering an excluded area without permission. The CPS discontinued the prosecution because, in their view, there was no realistic prospect of a conviction. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn three cases (of which Mohamed was one) charges relating to tampering with the electronic monitoring tag were discontinued after the CPS concluded that challenges to the reliability of the forensic evidence meant that, in their view, there was no realistic prospect of a conviction. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOne person was found not guilty in relation to two counts of breaching - failure to report to the police station and failure to report to the monitoring company as required. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOne person is currently remanded in custody awaiting trial, having been charged with one count of breaching - having an unauthorised meeting. 
default&#xa0;
defaultControl order absconds default5. You asked whether any of the control order absconds were connected with a mosque. One control order subject, who absconded in 2007, was last seen at a mosque. There is no evidence to indicate that any of the other six individuals subject to Control Orders absconded from mosques. One person is believed to have escaped from a window of West Middlesex Hospital; three who were not tagged, disappeared sometime after making a routine report to a police station; one who was tagged disconnected an electronic monitoring unit and cut off his tag at his home before disappearing; and one disappeared during the short window between one control order being quashed and a new control order being served against him on the same day. Control Order subjects did not have GPS tags. One of the purposes of the new tag is to provide reassurance of an individual’s location and monitor his compliance with measures which restrict his movement. 
default&#xa0;
defaultPassports belonging to TPIM subjects default6. All the TPIM subjects are prohibited by their measures from possessing or taking any steps to obtain a passport. All passports of TPIM subjects, other than that of Mohamed, are accounted for and are in the possession of the police. 
default&#xa0;
default7. Mohamed was issued with a British passport on 28 April 2005. When he was deported to the UK he did not have this passport with him, so there was no passport for the police to seize. The whereabouts of this passport are unknown. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMohamed’s citizenship default8. Mohamed entered the UK, aged three, with his mother on 12 June 1989. His mother claimed asylum on her and her children’s behalf on 29 July 1989. The family were recognised as refugees on 30 October 1989 and granted four years leave to remain. They applied for indefinite leave to remain on 20 September 1993, which was granted on 28 April 1994. Mohamed and his family were naturalised as British citizens on 23 November 1999, when he was aged 13. Under Somalia nationality law Mohamed automatically lost his Somali citizenship when he became British. He is therefore a UK mono-national. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMohamed’s deportation from Somaliland default9. As this matter is currently the subject of ongoing civil litigation I cannot provide any details further to what I told the Committee. However, I can confirm that documents relating to Mohamed's deportation from Somaliland were disclosed during open session in the TPIMs proceedings by both the Government and Mohamed's lawyers. These documents are not in the public domain. 
default&#xa0;
default10. You asked why Mohamed was allowed to return to the UK. Section 1(1) of the Immigration Act 1971 exempts from immigration control persons who have the right of abode. This means that there is no legal basis for preventing British citizens, like Mohamed, from returning to the UK, whatever the circumstances of their return and whatever their activities abroad. Where someone is a British citizen, it is not therefore necessary for a foreign government to request that we take them back. 
default&#xa0;
defaultDeportation of suspected terrorists to the UK default11. You asked about the number of people who have been detained overseas for terrorism offences, who were not prosecuted, and were then deported back to the UK. I cannot yet give you a definitive answer to this question. I have asked officials to work with the police and their network of Counter Terrorism and Extremism Liaison Officers (CTELOs) to collate the information which we expect to send you in early December. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe possible prosecution of TPIM subjects for terrorist offences default12. You asked whether Mohamed or other TPIM subjects could have been prosecuted were it not for sensitivities around evidence being produced in open court. For each TPIM case, under section 10 of the TPIM Act 2011, the CPS review all material held by the relevant agencies in order to determine whether there is evidence available that could realistically be used for the purposes of prosecuting the individual for an offence relating to terrorism. This review is, of course, conducted according to existing evidential rules and does not address a hypothetical situation where secret intelligence material could be used as evidence. 
default&#xa0;
default13. The CPS have told me that it is not possible to say, on a case-by-case basis, how such a hypothetical situation would affect the prospects of prosecution because the evidential rules that would apply in such a situation are, by definition, unknown. However, to help the Committee, I have asked the CPS to give their overall opinion of what difference the use of secret evidence might make to their ability to prosecute TPIM subjects. The CPS are considering this and I will write to you soon with the results. I would note in the meantime para 7.15 of David Anderson’s 2012 TPIM report (published March 2013) which states: “I asked the CPS to tell me whether their decisions not to charge any of the 10 TPIM subjects would have been different had intercept evidence been admissible in criminal proceedings. Having consulted the relevant case lawyers, they advised me, without confirming whether or not such material existed in any case, that their charging decision would have remained the same in each of the 10 cases”. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCommunications data default14. You asked me to provide further data on the breakdown of requests for communications data, particularly with reference to GCHQ. This data is collected and collated by the Interception of Communications Commissioner. 
default&#xa0;
default15. The Commissioner’s 2012 Annual Report stated that there had been 570,135 requests for data that year. It is not possible to identify accurately the number of people to which these requests relate. The reason for this is that at the time of an application for data and subsequently it is often not clear to law enforcement agencies how many people are using a single phone or indeed who the „owner‟ of it might be. Members of criminal gangs and terrorist groups do not own a single phone like the rest of us. Phones are frequently shared and then disposed of very quickly. As I said in the Committee session, the requests will therefore relate to a significantly lower number of investigations and people – some investigations involve many hundreds of requests, many relating to the same person. The Joint Committee on the Draft Communications Data Bill, which reported in December 2012 described (in appendix 4 to the report) a case where 500 applications were made for different types of data relating to just five people. 
default&#xa0;
default16. The Commissioner’s report outlines that 99% of total requests come from law enforcement and the security agencies. This includes police forces across the UK, the Serious and Organised Crime Agency (now part of the National Crime Agency), HM Revenue and Customs, the former UK Border Agency and the intelligence agencies 
default(MI5, SIS and GCHQ). The remaining 1% relate to requests from other public authorities; the vast majority are from the Financial Services Authority (now the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority) and local authorities. 
default&#xa0;
default17. The Joint Committee on the Draft Communications Data Bill recommended that more detailed information should be collated about communications data requests. The Home Office is keen to improve the public information on how communications data is used to support law enforcement investigations. We have consulted the Interception of Communications Commissioner on what additional statistics could be collected that would add value to his annual report to the Prime Minister. We are looking at a number of data categories such as the types of crime being investigated and the number of applications which are rejected (or where further work is required) at each stage of the process. 
default&#xa0;
default18. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance to the Committee.

defaultAnnex A 
defaultMOHAMMED AHMED MOHAMED – CASE CHRONOLOGY default&#xa0;
defaultOn 
default5 May 1986 defaultMohamed was born in Somalia. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn 
default1989 defaultMohamed arrived in the UK. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOn 
default23 November 1999 defaultMohamed was granted British citizenship (aged 13). 
default&#xa0;
defaultOn 
default14 January 2011 defaultMohamed was arrested and interviewed in 
defaultBurao
default, Somaliland with two other individuals. All three were accused of conspiracy to commit offences against national security. But Somaliland authorities did not prosecute any of the three because of insufficient admissible evidence. One individual was released locally; Mohamed and the third individual, a British national, were subsequently deported to the UK. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOn 
default13 March 2011 defaultMohamed was deported back to the UK. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOn 
default14 March 2011 defaultMohamed arrived in the UK. He was detained and examined under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Following that he was served with a Control Order and relocated to a town in the east of England. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOn 
default12 October 2011 defaultMohamed was arrested, and subsequently charged and remanded in custody in relation to 
default14 defaultbreaches of his control order: 
default&#xa0;
default18 August – failed to call monitoring company as required. 
default27 August – failed to report to police station as required. 
default7 September – failed to call monitoring company as required. 
default11 September – failed to report to police station as required. 
default15 September – failed to call monitoring company as required. 
default23 September – returned late for curfew. 
default28 September – met a person without prior permission. 
default28 September – possession of unauthorised mobile phone. 
default29 September – met a person without prior permission. 
default29 September – went outside his geographical boundary. 
default29 September – entered an internet cafe without permission. 
default30 September – failed to report to police station as required. 
default9 October – failed to call monitoring company as required. 
default11 October 2011 – unauthorised possession of an MP3 player. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOn 
default21 February 2012 defaultMohamed was released on bail by the court after successfully arguing – amongst other reasons – that his trial for breaches should be delayed behind the High Court review of his control order. The CPS opposed bail but the Judge decided that, given the length of time Mohamed had spent on remand, bail should be granted. A TPIM notice was served on Mohamed the same day and he was moved to Home Office provided accommodation in London. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn 
defaultJuly 2012 defaultthe High Court heard the review of the lawfulness of the Control Order and TPIM. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOn 
default19 October 2012 defaultLloyd Jones LJ handed down a judgment, upholding both the Control Order and TPIM. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOn 
default29 December 2012 defaultMohamed was arrested, and subsequently charged and remanded in custody in relation to 
defaultsix defaultbreaches of his TPIM between 22 and 28 December 2013 (failing to report to the police station or reporting late). 
default&#xa0;
defaultOn 
default19 April 2013 defaultMohamed was released on bail by the court (again, the CPS opposed bail). The High Court had upheld the control order and TPIM in a judgment handed down on 19 October 2012, but Mohamed argued that his trial for breach should be delayed behind his appeal against the High Court’s judgment. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOn 
default25 July 2013 defaultMohamed was arrested, and subsequently charged and remanded in custody in relation to 
defaultone defaultbreach of his TPIM – a ‘tag tamper’ which occurred on 16 May 2013. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOn 
default6 August 2013 default– Mohamed was released on bail by the court (again, the CPS opposed bail). He continued to argue that his trial for breaches should be delayed behind his appeal against the High Court’s judgment upholding the control order and TPIM. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOn 
default1 November 2013 defaultthe CPS discontinued the prosecution for the alleged ‘tag tamper’ of 16 May 2013 because challenges to the reliability of the forensic evidence meant that, in their view, there was no realistic prospect of a conviction. 
defaultLater that day Mohamed absconded. His tag sent a tamper alert to the monitoring company, which was relayed by an automatic email to the Home Office and police. This was followed up by telephone between the monitoring company, Home Office and police. The Committee has received a confidential letter from G4S setting out further details of the immediate response, including precise timings. I can confirm the contents of that letter. 
defaultThe police immediately launched an intensive operation to locate Mohamed. Ports and borders were notified with his photograph and details circulated nationally and internationally. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOn 
default2 November 2013 defaultthe Court, on the application of the Home Secretary, lifted the anonymity order in place in relation to Mohamed. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOn 
default3 November 2013 defaultthe police appealed for public’s help in locating Mohamed. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAt the point when he absconded, Mohamed was still on bail in relation to 14 breaches of his control order and six breaches of his TPIM notice. The court had listed a combined trial for these breaches for the week beginning 28 April 2014. If Mohamed is not apprehended it is likely that the trial will be postponed. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMohamed’s appeal against the High Court decision to uphold the Control Order and TPIM had been listed for hearing in January 2014. Discussions between the parties and the Court will now take place to decide whether the case should still go ahead
default&#xa0;
