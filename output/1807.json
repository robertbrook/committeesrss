"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Elisabeth Bendall (TIC 103)\n&#xa0;\nSUBMISSION\n&#xa0;\nI would like the Select Committee to consider the effect of the Deregulation of Buses Act 1985 on bus transport\n in the UK \nas it exists today.\n  I believe the whole picture \nof bus travel has to be considered before “Passenger Transport in Isolated Communities” can be addressed.\n&#xa0;\nTo illustrate my concern, I wish to describe \nmy\n experience with a commercial bus company that has become a symptomatic example of how isolation from \nbus services can occur.\n&#xa0;\nTRAVEL IN TRING, HERTFORDSHIRE\n&#xa0;\nI am a resident of Tring, a market town in South West Hertfordshire and only 30 miles from London.  There are two major commercial bus routes serving Tring: - Arriva 500 Aylesbury to Watford, and Arr\niva 61 Aylesbury to Luton.\n&#xa0;\nTring Railway Station is on the West Coast mainline and has a London Midland commuter service to Euston.  Tring Station is 1½ miles from Tring town centre and therefore \nthere are\n difficulties of access for those without a car.\n&#xa0;\nCHANGE OF ROUTE FOR ARRIVA BUS ROUTE 500\n&#xa0;\nOn 10\nth\n May 2010 Arriva the Shires changed the route of the 500 bus service so that the area of housing to the eastern side of the town was no longer served.  The bus now travels along a road with no housing but passes a Tesco store, and the difference in the len\ngth of route is less than half a mile.\n&#xa0;\nThe only response from Arriva to the passengers who were affected by the cut was that “Arriva regrets any inconvenience caused”.  In August 2010 I arranged a meeting with two Arriva Managers, the Tring Town Mayor, Da\nvid Gauke MP and our County Councillor.  We were told that due to highways problems elsewhere in the County\n,\n the cut in Tring had to be made to protect the punctuality of the 500 bus.\n&#xa0;\nAn account of the ensuing efforts to tackle the highways concerns is gi\nven in my article “A Tale from Tring” published in “Bus User” No. 47 Summer 2012 by Bus Users UK available on \nwww.bususers.org\n \n&#xa0;\nBy 14\nth\n August 2011, County Councillor Stuart Pile, Executive Member Highways &amp; Transpo\nrt, Herts County Council, was able to write to David Gauke MP stating that in his opinion the highways problems were settled.  However, after three years we still do not have our bus back.\n&#xa0;\nTHE EFFECT OF THE CUT IN ROUTE 500\n&#xa0;\nFor over 30 years, since t\nhe eastern side of Tring was developed for housing, the 500 bus had connected passengers to the amenities of Tring town, Aylesbury, Berkhamsted, Hemel Hempstead, and Watford.  A school time service is retained for Tring Secondary School.\n&#xa0;\nWithout the bus t\nhere is at least a half-mile walk to Tring\n town centre with its amenities\n and other bus connections\n (uphill on the return)\n, and \nover a\n 1 mile to the main doctors’ surgery,\nDuring the day, bus passengers using the 500 were mainly elderly\n,\n and they are now w\nithout the freedom to travel without gaining assistance from friends, or local voluntary agencies, or paying the standard cost of a taxi to town of £5.00.\n&#xa0;\nTherefore even in a town that is only 30 miles from London, there are people who have planned their \nlives around a bus service and are left isolated in a suburban area.\n&#xa0;\nMY THOUGHTS ON BUS ORGANISATION IN 2013\n&#xa0;\nTRI\nNG BUS USERS GROUP\n&#xa0;\nI launched the Group this year as a member group of Bus Users UK, to encourage bus use in Tring and the Villages.  \nThe formation of the Group has \nhelped build\n relationship\ns\n with our local bus companies, \nwhereby we\n can \nnow gain advance n\notice of\n route changes etc.  \n&#xa0;\nOur first speaker in May 2013 was Paul Morgan, Network Development Manager for Arriva the Shires.  He explained that the 500 bus route is currently again under review, and the Group is hoping to be able to comment on this rev\niew before it is finalised.\n&#xa0;\nTring Bus Users Group is \nalso \nworking with Herts County Council to try and improve the County funded local within \ntheir \ntight cost restraints.\n \n&#xa0;\nCONCLUSION\n&#xa0;\nIf buses are not to be re-nationalised, then Government oversight must\n be obtained such as exists for London with “Transport for London” in order to gain some control over the bus industry.  There will be more and more cuts in routes by commercial companies as profits take priority, and County Councils will be relied upon to\n provide public transport for those left without buses and therefore in isolated communities.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
