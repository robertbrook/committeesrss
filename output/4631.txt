[[[Written evidence submitted by Francesca Hinton]]]

[[[Summary]]]The Select Committee has called for written evidence on the effectiveness of academy status for schools. This submission focusses only on the fifth reference raised of: “The appropriateness of academy status for primary schools and what special factors apply”.Recommended as crucial for consideration in this inquiry are the contextual factors of rurality and size. It is vital to acknowledge how corresponding factors, such as limited available resources and geographical coherence in smaller rural primaries can limit the opportunities offered to them by academy status. The following concerns must be raised: Side-lined, yet also critical to this inquiry is the effect that greater academisation is having upon those schools that rely upon LA support. Reduced funding for non-academies that remain with the LA can leave schools vulnerable and facing closure or academisation. With smaller primaries most reliant upon LA support, this is a significant note of consideration on the appropriateness of academisation for this inquiry.

[[[Introduction]]]This submission is the product of extensive research that included contacting county councils, interviewing once council’s Assistant Director of Children’s Services, and analysing both committee reports and academy statistics at a regional and national level. It is compiled with the aim of raising schools standards and achievements in rural areas, where these can fall significantly below the national average. In my own county of Norfolk, results and achievements have fallen to the extent where 40% of primaries were rated by Ofsted as “Less than good” in comparison to a national average of 31%. With the experience of attending an Academy in such a rural setting, it is my concern that the comparative difficulties facing these smaller schools in rural areas are not relegated from the public agenda.

[[[Raising standards through competition: the case of alternative service providers]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1&#xa0;&#xa0; Academy conversion offers schools the freedom to either continue purchasing services from their LA, or seek more competitive alternatives elsewhere. Yet, this freedom of choice has been contextually limited. Interviewing the Assistant Director of Children’s Services from one County Council, an absence of alternative providers in rural areas was cited as evident from the lack of competitive standards in these areas. This could mean advantages of academy conversion are potentially stagnated in rural schools when there is little competition or choice between service providers from which to drive up standards.&#xa0;3.2&#xa0;&#xa0; These schools can face the alternatives of either: i) remaining to purchase services form the Local Authority or ii) outsourcing to other providers less local to the area. Continuing to purchase services from the LA can potentially problematise efficiencies in provision when LA standards are poor or below par. Schools that comparatively choose to outsource service provision to a less local provider may face similar issues of efficiency due to the lack of geographical proximity. &#xa0;3.3&#xa0;&#xa0; In the context of small primary academies without local alternatives, ii) is a particularly ineffective solution. This is due to the great strategic capacity required to coordinate this service provision.  With fewer resources in specialist staff and a reduced institutional capacity, these schools may face greater difficulty in outsourcing and maintaining the most competitive providers from more distant locations. &#xa0;3.4&#xa0;&#xa0; If academy conversion is to be an effective solution for smaller primaries in rural areas, there must be a sufficient range of local alternatives for the provision of services. This is particularly vital in instances where the Local Authority’s quality and efficiency in services is of a poor standard.

[[[The role of the LA in the formation of partnerships between schools]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.0&#xa0;&#xa0; Partnerships are frequently cited as an effective solution for smaller schools lacking the resources required to outsource the most competitive providers. Whereby encouraging schools to pool resources together may increase smaller schools’ institutional capacity and encourage greater economies of scale to be achieved. Yet, context is a prevalent issue for consideration here when some schools face greater difficulties than others in coordinating the formation of these partnerships. &#xa0;4.1&#xa0;&#xa0; In their previous inquiry into the effectiveness of partnerships for secondary schools alone, the committee recommended that those “In which all members are located in within close proximity are most likely to be effective”. This concern of the committee is similarly prevalent to the case of primary academies. With a greater numeracy and more widely distributed location across counties, issues of geographical proximity can potentially be exacerbated more greatly for the context of these small, rural primaries. &#xa0;3.1&#xa0;&#xa0; The role of the Local Authority could be key to coordinating efforts between these schools in the formation of effective partnerships. In a report on academy strategies, the Norfolk County Council noted the “considerable strategic capacity”  required to encourage groups of primary schools to set up their own arrangements or form local partnerships. With the LA needing to evolve to the recent conditions of academies within the educational landscape, a role of coordination could match the expertise in local knowledge of these authorities with the ability to increase educational standards. This is particularly vital to smaller rural primaries, where the LA could contribute to increasing their institutional capacity by encouraging a pooling together of resources, expertise and knowledge between schools. &#xa0;

[[[The impact of academisation on small primaries that rely upon LA support]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1&#xa0;&#xa0; Relegated from the terms of this inquiry are the effects of academisation on the support framework of the LA. It is evident that increased academisation can significantly affect the ability of the LA to continue to fund those non-academies, with smaller primaries most at risk. If an LA is no longer required to provide non-statutory school support services to academies, they risk receiving a significant reduction in their revenue grant. This could subsequently affect their ability to support financially those schools that remain under their provision.&#xa0;3.2&#xa0;&#xa0; It is in particular those smaller primary schools that are at greatest risk from subsequent issues of funding when they are the most reliant upon the LA for support for resources. The Lincolnshire County Council warned previously of how the implementation of the current Academies policy could lead to 184 out of 276 primary schools being at risk of closure from a reduced revenue grant. &#xa0;3.3&#xa0;&#xa0; The pertinence of this issue in funding is reflected in how the LCC was subsequently forced to admit that it no longer had the financial capacity with which to fund those remaining schools under its support. That it recommended these schools’ conversion to academy status and membership to a trust located hundreds of miles away demonstrates the clear failures in the funding system for Local Authorities. &#xa0;3.4&#xa0;&#xa0; This incident reflects two issues for consideration: 1) That the appropriation of funds to the Local Authority must be adjusted to account for the increased academisation of schools and separation from LA support 2) That rather than recommending smaller schools to join trusts located miles away, the role of the LA would better be appropriated to use is local knowledge and expertise to coordinate local trust formations. With small rural primaries most at risk of reduced funding in LA support, this is a pertinent issue of consideration for this committee inquiry on the effects of the academisation process.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0; “A good school for every Norfolk learner” Report by the Director of Children’s Services (April 2013) http://www.norfolk.gov.uk/view/cabinet080413item14pdf Telephone interview with Assistant Director of Children’s Services conducted December 7th 2013.  “Geographical Coherence”, Education Committee Report School Partnerships and Cooperation. 52-56. “A revised Academy Strategy for Norfolk” (November 2011) http://www.norfolk.gov.uk/view/cabinet141111item10pdf “The Council’s leadership role within a changing education system” Lincolnshire County Council,  (July 2011) http://www.lgcplus.com/Journals/3/Files/2011/8/3/Lincolnshire%20schools%20report.pdf
