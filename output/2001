&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]I wish to
[normal] [bold]support the
[normal] [bold]inclusion of the following two clauses in the Bill:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“All unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs), and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads (UCRs) should be recognised as not being part of the ordinary roads network, and should be re-classified as Restricted Byways.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]And
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“When a local authority declines to impose a traffic regulation order that is widely-supported by the public, there should be a right of appeal, either to an independent inspector, or a magistrate.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The inclusion of the first clause would put an end to the destruction of ancient green lanes caused by their use by recreational motor vehicles, e.g. motor cycles and 4 x 4s. The use of unsealed BOATs and UCRs by such vehicles has led to severe damage to the surface of these lanes to the detriment of other users, for example walkers and horse riders. 
[normal]Gorbeck
[normal] Road in the Yorkshire Dales National Park is one such lane. It is a fine green lane, linking 
[normal]Malhamdale
[normal] and 
[normal]Ribblesdale
[normal], offering spectacular views of the Yorkshire Three Peaks. Its use by motor bikes and 4 x4s caused deep ruts and wide muddy stretches over long parts of the road, making walking along the road very difficult. It is now protected by a traffic regulation order prohibiting its use by recreational motor vehicles and the surface is gradually recovering. However the imposition of a traffic regulation order is a lengthy and costly process. It would be much more efficient for all such unsealed roads to be classified as Restricted Byways which do not have rights of way for recreational motors.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The inclusion of the second clause 
[normal]would  enable
[normal] an appeal to be made in the event of the public’s wish for the imposition of a traffic regulation order being frustrated by a local authority’s refusal to act. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I fully support the formal submissions being made on the Bill by the Green Lanes Environmental Action Group (GLEAM), the Green Lanes Protection Group (GLPG), the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance (PDGLA) and the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance (YDGLA).
