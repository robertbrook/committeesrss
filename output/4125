[normal]Cyclists have to be allowed to move to the front at traffic lights. Of course this already exists at many lights, especially in London. My point is that cyclists should have a legal right to move as far forward as possible from the first car in the queue. 
[normal]This is a question of safety, pure and simple. Starting off from standing in a line of traffic is dangerous whereas have a ten yard headstart isn’t and promotes the flow of traffic. A good cyclist will do this every time as well as moving before the light 
[normal]turns green at junctions where they know the light cycle. This isn’t to gain 2 seconds or piss off car drivers, it’s to ensure personal safety. If anything there should be a cyclists green light a few seconds before the main light. 
[normal]At the same time cyclis
[normal]ts without lights must be punished, it’s not fair on anyone who is involved in accident with an unlit cyclist, there’s no excuse for it.  A zero tolerance approach should be adopted to cyclists who aren’t visible to drivers.

[normal]Police and learner drivers sh
[normal]ould undergo cycle awareness training. New drivers so that they understand the challenges facing a cyclist and will be able to predict movements (dodging a drain cover etc) and not got lost up their own asses with self importance when a cyclist slows them 
[normal]down by a couple of seconds. 
[normal]Police need to understand why cyclists do what they do at traffic lights and not issue fines in a black and white manner. If it is obvious that a cyclist has moved infront of the white line to protect themselves there should b
[normal]e no fine.
