"              \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from M.A.G (WRT 018)&#xa0;\n1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nM.A.G welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Call for Evidence. \nM.A.G \nis\n the\n \nUK’s \nsecond \nlargest airport operator and owns and \noperates\n Manchester, \nStanste\nd, \nEast \nMidlands and Bournemouth airports.\n \n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nM.A.G\n airports handle\n over 42\n million passengers and \n600\n,000 tonnes of cargo, \nand\n \nt\nhe group’s activities cover air traffic services, car parking, retail concession management, airport security services, fire fighting, e\nngineering and property development. \nM.A.G\n is\n owned by the ten local authorities of Greater Manchester\n, in partnership with global investment manager IFM.\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur responses to the questions in the Call for Evidence are set out below.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow resilient are the UK’s transport networks (including road, rail and air) to adverse winter weather?&#xa0;\n2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nM.A.G airports have taken steps to ensure that, as far as possible, flights can continue operating safely during periods of snowfall. \nAll M.A.G\n airports ha\nve a comprehensive Winter Operations Plan, \nwhich comes into effect on 1 November \nfollowing consultation with airfield tenants. The plan explains what preparations have been made to deal with extreme winter weather, and sets out roles and responsibilities.\n \nIt also \nincludes a detailed set of crisis management plans in the event of severe disruption\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nStansted Airport’s plan is subject to rigorous testing programmes, including summer desktop exercise run jointly with airlines, handling agents and operational t\neams. A Terminal Welfare Plan, also operated in conjunction with airlines, sets out roles and responsibilities for passenger information, provisions, facilities and hotels and rebooking.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Winter Operations Plan is reviewed annually and\n improvements added based on lessons learned\n. \nFor example, \nthe Terminal team at Manchester have carried out additional work this year to make the passenger welfare element more robust. This included working with procurement colleagues to look at how to sec\nure additional supplies at short notice; working with Manchester City Council to pool resources; reviewing communications, such as use of passenger information screens; and working closely with retail colleagues to ensure the availability of food, drink an\nd essentials.\n \nOur terminal and operations teams also draw on best practice from other European airports.\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWork is \nalso \nunderway at Manchester to explore how to ensure the safety and well-being of colleagues, but looking at how they can get into work, e.g. \nadvance booking of hotels for operation critical colleagues and call out groups for those living close by.\nWhat lessons have been learned since the severe weather experienced in the winter of 2009-10? What practical changes have been made to ensure the UK is now better equipped to deal with severe weather?2.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nM.A.G airports have invested substantially in snow clearing equipment since the severe 2009-10 winter (see below for details). Lessons learned included increased supplies of and storage areas for road sal\nt and de-icer; improvements to crisis management systems and changes to weather forecasting information, to allow for more accurate forecasting.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDespite extensive preparation and investment\n, constant snowfall remains a significant challenge. Just 3mm of snow on the ground sees airfield operations slow down and constant snowfall makes any clearing operation \nprolonged and challenging\n.\n Manchester Airport has invested in equipment to monitor the\n ground temperature (snow will melt if the ground is warmer than freezing) which means that \nappropriate airfield anti\n-icing \naction\n can be \nundertaken\n \nin a timely and efficient manner, thus preserving operational continuity.\nHow well prepared are the Government, local authorities and transport providers for adverse winter weather? What more should be done to ensure a coordinated response?2.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have observed that during periods of bad weather improvements do appear to have been made to procedures for major roads\n (motorways and trunk roads) to keep them clear, though some problems continue on A and B roads, impacting on airport colleagues getting to and from work. \n&#xa0;\n2.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEast Midlands Airport\n is a member of the LRF Severe Weather Group which coordinates the response to inclement weather \nacross the County. \nAll main roads leading to \nBournemouth\n Airport \na\nre gritted and maintained by \nthe C\nounty Council and \ndetails of the various routes covered are\n available on their website\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAt Stansted, all private roads and car parks within the airport boundary are gritted, maintained and managed by Stansted Airport Limited, all other primary and secondary roads are managed by Essex County Council and in the cas\ne of the M11, the Highways Agency.\n&#xa0;\n Stansted Airport works in partnership with Local Authorities, Government Agencies and surface access providers through the airport’s Transport Forum to ensure all necessary steps are taken to prepare for and manage incid\nences of inclement weather. \n&#xa0;\n2.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nManchester Airport has a good working relationship with Manchester City Council, who are responsible for gritting the main access roads to the site. Onsite roads\n and pavements are looked after by Manchester Airport’s landside \nteam, who pre-treat the area in advance of anticipated snowfall.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Manchester Airport&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nStansted Airport&#xa0;&#xa0;\nEast Midlands Airport&#xa0;&#xa0;Bournemouth Airport&#xa0;&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n              \n&#xa0;\n"
