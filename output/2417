[normal]Written evidence submitted by Dudley Friend [bold]Clayson[bold] [OLS0028][bold]&#xa0;
[normal]I write as an independent &amp; individual contributor of evidence to this Inquiry.
[normal]I am t
[normal]he retired Chief Executive of 
[normal]a
[normal] company
[normal] supplying UK industry with
[normal] 
[normal]packaging
[normal] 
[normal]machinery &amp; consumables.
[normal]  My wife is a retired doctor.
[normal]  Our evidence will cover the following issues:
[normal]1. How
[normal] did 
[normal]we
[normal] cope? 
[normal] 
[normal]My wife &amp; I raised our family of four children without a computer in our 
[normal]home
[normal].  As practising Christians we could 
[normal]not
[normal], with a 
[normal]good conscience, 
[normal]expose
[normal] our children to the possibility of coming in contact with the poison of adult pornographic material, which is
[normal] morally destructive in its consequences
[normal] 
[normal]and “utterly
[normal] 
[normal]without redeeming social value” (1966 Supreme Court 
[normal]ruling in the obs
[normal]cenity case re. 
[normal]Fanny Hill,
[normal] defining pornographic material).
[normal] 
[normal]2. Our
[normal] children are now married, and have
[normal] their own families.  Both they and we
[normal] all
[normal] now have computers in our homes 
[normal]which are effectively 
[normal]filtered
[normal] 
[normal]to
[normal] eliminate any possibility of inadverte
[normal]nt contact with 
[normal]adult material 
[normal]by anyone in the household.
[normal]3. Implicit
[normal] in
[normal] this Inquiry is the Government’s acknowledgement that the exposure of minors to adult material is harmful.
[normal]  Such exposure entails 
[normal]grave
[normal] consequences for the child, the family and for
[normal] society at large.  We are now seeing the social norms &amp; stabilising values which have underpinned our
[normal] customary
[normal] way of life in this country being threatened by the emergence of a juvenile generation whose attitudes in respect of sexual 
[normal]gratification
[normal], sexu
[normal]al crime, violence, promiscuity and marri
[normal]age are being distorted
[normal] &amp; perverted by exposure to online pornography.   Sadly we have had
[normal] some
[normal] first
[normal]-
[normal] hand experience 
[normal]of damage to just a very few of 
[normal]the
[normal] young people in our church who have temporarily
[normal] had contact 
[normal]with
[normal] this depraved material.  It has required ongoing pastoral care &amp; counselling to help them
[normal] to get
[normal] through the moral distress and mental disturbance resulting from this
[normal] exposure.  Pornography leaves a scarring in the
[normal] mind
[normal].  We trust that the effects wil
[normal]l be short-term; but for some it could be a lifelong trauma. 
[normal]4. It
[normal] is heartening to see that Government is working with internet providers
[normal] to put in place measures which will effectively protect minors from easy &amp; instant access to adult material.  The Pr
[normal]ime Minister himself has given an undertaking that pornography will be 
[normal]automatically
[normal] blocked on 
[normal]new
[normal] broadband
[normal] internet accounts, leaving viewers with the option to remove the filter if they so 
[normal]decide
[normal].  Mr Cameron has also made a commitme
[normal]nt in respect of ex
[normal]isting user
[normal]s: the principal internet providers will have an o
[normal]bligation to contact customers 
[normal]with an “unav
[normal]oidable decision about whether 
[normal]or not to install family friendly 
[normal]content
[normal] filters”.  He has 
[normal]indicated
[normal] this will happen by end-2014.
[normal]  OFCOM will be responsible for implementation of these measures.  The Prime Minister has promised to take further action if, following these 
[normal]steps
[normal], there is evidence that children are still not being effectively protected.  We welcome his robust stance on
[normal] this issue, which will mean that the many 
[normal]parents
[normal] who 
[normal]would like
[normal] to be prompted or reminded  will get that reminder and will be shown 
[normal]very
[normal] clearly how to put on family friendly filters
[normal]. 
[normal]This is a positive move and a valuable commitment at the highest lev
[normal]el in Government.
[normal]5. 
[normal]OFCOM
[normal] 
[normal]should prioritise regulat
[normal]ion of social media, such as Facebook, and chatrooms, where the content is not 
[normal]infrequently
[normal] pornographic. 
[normal]OFCOM 
[normal]must
[normal] ensure that the regulation &amp; m
[normal]onitoring of these sites are significantly
[normal] upgraded, 
[normal]wit
[normal]h mandatory training 
[normal]&amp; compliance regimes put in place. 
[normal]Social
[normal] media should be placed under specific obligation to delete offensive 
[normal]material
[normal] swiftly 
[normal]whenever
[normal] a 
[normal]viewer
[normal] complaint is 
[normal]received
[normal]. This is in essence a Health &amp; Safety legislation issue and every o
[normal]ther industry in which I 
[normal]have
[normal] been active has been subject to
[normal] the
[normal] strict
[normal]est
[normal] compliance with HSE.  The internet should be 
[normal]no
[normal] exception.
[normal]6. OFCOM should recognise that social media are exploited by paedophiles, prostitutes and sex traffickers
[normal] and should 
[normal]crea
[normal]te
[normal] an 
[normal]appropriately
[normal] strong regulatory framework to block these criminal and anti-
[normal]social
[normal] abuses of 
[normal]the
[normal] internet. 
[normal]OFCOM should also require social networking sites to implement effective &amp; inescapable age verification checks to 
[normal]prevent
[normal] minors accessing inap
[normal]propriate material.
[normal]7. The 
[normal]internet
[normal] industry should
[normal] devote resources to
[normal] develop technology to 
[normal]prevent
[normal] the covert and currently uncontrollable 
[normal]circulation of adult 
[normal]material 
[normal]within minors
[normal]’ peer groups
[normal] (such as school friend communities).
[normal]In 
[normal]conclusion, we 
[normal]are grateful for
[normal] this Inquiry
[normal].  The current situation is dire, with a reported 81% of 14-16 year 
[normal]olds
[normal] having already accessed 
[normal]pornographic material on
[normal]line.  W
[normal]e
[normal] believe that &lt; 50% of UK families currently 
[normal]have
[normal] family friendly content filters in their home c
[normal]omputers. The 
[normal]Government’s
[normal] commitments in response to this
[normal] situation are
[normal] encouraging.  We and a wide circle of our friends in th
[normal]is country will be scrutinising progress and
[normal] developments 
[normal]closely.  
[normal]We are ver
[normal]y deeply concerned that the situation is
[normal] rapidly
[normal] 
[normal]brought under effective, ongoing control
[normal]—
[normal]for the sake of 
[normal]e
[normal]very young person and child in this country.
