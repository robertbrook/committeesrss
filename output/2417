defaultWritten evidence submitted by Dudley Friend defaultClaysondefault [OLS0028]default&#xa0;
defaultI write as an independent &amp; individual contributor of evidence to this Inquiry.
defaultI am t
defaulthe retired Chief Executive of 
defaulta
default company
default supplying UK industry with
default 
defaultpackaging
default 
defaultmachinery &amp; consumables.
default  My wife is a retired doctor.
default  Our evidence will cover the following issues:
default1. How
default did 
defaultwe
default cope? 
default 
defaultMy wife &amp; I raised our family of four children without a computer in our 
defaulthome
default.  As practising Christians we could 
defaultnot
default, with a 
defaultgood conscience, 
defaultexpose
default our children to the possibility of coming in contact with the poison of adult pornographic material, which is
default morally destructive in its consequences
default 
defaultand “utterly
default 
defaultwithout redeeming social value” (1966 Supreme Court 
defaultruling in the obs
defaultcenity case re. 
defaultFanny Hill,
default defining pornographic material).
default 
default2. Our
default children are now married, and have
default their own families.  Both they and we
default all
default now have computers in our homes 
defaultwhich are effectively 
defaultfiltered
default 
defaultto
default eliminate any possibility of inadverte
defaultnt contact with 
defaultadult material 
defaultby anyone in the household.
default3. Implicit
default in
default this Inquiry is the Government’s acknowledgement that the exposure of minors to adult material is harmful.
default  Such exposure entails 
defaultgrave
default consequences for the child, the family and for
default society at large.  We are now seeing the social norms &amp; stabilising values which have underpinned our
default customary
default way of life in this country being threatened by the emergence of a juvenile generation whose attitudes in respect of sexual 
defaultgratification
default, sexu
defaultal crime, violence, promiscuity and marri
defaultage are being distorted
default &amp; perverted by exposure to online pornography.   Sadly we have had
default some
default first
default-
default hand experience 
defaultof damage to just a very few of 
defaultthe
default young people in our church who have temporarily
default had contact 
defaultwith
default this depraved material.  It has required ongoing pastoral care &amp; counselling to help them
default to get
default through the moral distress and mental disturbance resulting from this
default exposure.  Pornography leaves a scarring in the
default mind
default.  We trust that the effects wil
defaultl be short-term; but for some it could be a lifelong trauma. 
default4. It
default is heartening to see that Government is working with internet providers
default to put in place measures which will effectively protect minors from easy &amp; instant access to adult material.  The Pr
defaultime Minister himself has given an undertaking that pornography will be 
defaultautomatically
default blocked on 
defaultnew
default broadband
default internet accounts, leaving viewers with the option to remove the filter if they so 
defaultdecide
default.  Mr Cameron has also made a commitme
defaultnt in respect of ex
defaultisting user
defaults: the principal internet providers will have an o
defaultbligation to contact customers 
defaultwith an “unav
defaultoidable decision about whether 
defaultor not to install family friendly 
defaultcontent
default filters”.  He has 
defaultindicated
default this will happen by end-2014.
default  OFCOM will be responsible for implementation of these measures.  The Prime Minister has promised to take further action if, following these 
defaultsteps
default, there is evidence that children are still not being effectively protected.  We welcome his robust stance on
default this issue, which will mean that the many 
defaultparents
default who 
defaultwould like
default to be prompted or reminded  will get that reminder and will be shown 
defaultvery
default clearly how to put on family friendly filters
default. 
defaultThis is a positive move and a valuable commitment at the highest lev
defaultel in Government.
default5. 
defaultOFCOM
default 
defaultshould prioritise regulat
defaultion of social media, such as Facebook, and chatrooms, where the content is not 
defaultinfrequently
default pornographic. 
defaultOFCOM 
defaultmust
default ensure that the regulation &amp; m
defaultonitoring of these sites are significantly
default upgraded, 
defaultwit
defaulth mandatory training 
default&amp; compliance regimes put in place. 
defaultSocial
default media should be placed under specific obligation to delete offensive 
defaultmaterial
default swiftly 
defaultwhenever
default a 
defaultviewer
default complaint is 
defaultreceived
default. This is in essence a Health &amp; Safety legislation issue and every o
defaultther industry in which I 
defaulthave
default been active has been subject to
default the
default strict
defaultest
default compliance with HSE.  The internet should be 
defaultno
default exception.
default6. OFCOM should recognise that social media are exploited by paedophiles, prostitutes and sex traffickers
default and should 
defaultcrea
defaultte
default an 
defaultappropriately
default strong regulatory framework to block these criminal and anti-
defaultsocial
default abuses of 
defaultthe
default internet. 
defaultOFCOM should also require social networking sites to implement effective &amp; inescapable age verification checks to 
defaultprevent
default minors accessing inap
defaultpropriate material.
default7. The 
defaultinternet
default industry should
default devote resources to
default develop technology to 
defaultprevent
default the covert and currently uncontrollable 
defaultcirculation of adult 
defaultmaterial 
defaultwithin minors
default’ peer groups
default (such as school friend communities).
defaultIn 
defaultconclusion, we 
defaultare grateful for
default this Inquiry
default.  The current situation is dire, with a reported 81% of 14-16 year 
defaultolds
default having already accessed 
defaultpornographic material on
defaultline.  W
defaulte
default believe that &lt; 50% of UK families currently 
defaulthave
default family friendly content filters in their home c
defaultomputers. The 
defaultGovernment’s
default commitments in response to this
default situation are
default encouraging.  We and a wide circle of our friends in th
defaultis country will be scrutinising progress and
default developments 
defaultclosely.  
defaultWe are ver
defaulty deeply concerned that the situation is
default rapidly
default 
defaultbrought under effective, ongoing control
default—
defaultfor the sake of 
defaulte
defaultvery young person and child in this country.
