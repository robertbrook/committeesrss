[[[Executive Summary]]]It appears to me that the Government’s Consultation document on the Housing Standards Review demonstrates a lack of understanding of the Code for Sustainable Homes (CSH). For a start energy and carbon emissions is only one of a wide range of criteria assessed under the Code. Although this is reflected elsewhere in the document the section dealing with energy gives the impression that CSH is to be abandoned completely. This has also been the consensus of the associated press coverage. Secondly CSH is not a standard as such but an assessment protocol, designed to assess the overall sustainability of a dwelling. Thirdly, with regard to energy, the Consultation refers to an early version of the Code that compares dwelling emission rate (DER) levels against 2006 targets, whereas the 2010 edition uses Approved Document (AD) L1A 2010. Lastly the whole idea behind both CSH and the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) from which it evolved is to promote design and construction that go beyond Building Regulations and standard practice. I very much hope that it is not the Government’s intention to scrap CSH entirely. In my view the energy credits should be revised in line with revisions in AD L1A - which was always BRE's intention. I would strongly recommend disconnecting CSH from Government regulation and reverting to its original manifestation as an environmental assessment scheme administered by BRE.&#xa0;

[[[Introduction]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As a freelance consultant I specialise in the sustainable design of buildings and providing advice to design and masterplanning teams on all aspects of sustainability. I graduated with a first class honours degree in Environmental Engineering in 1975 since when I have worked as a mechanical services design engineer, a lecturer and researcher, setting up my own consultancy in 1988. This became Building Health Consultants Ltd, which remains today as part of URS Scott Wilson. In 2000 I established the Building Sustainability Unit at URS, from which I retired at the end of 2008.1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; I am a Cabe Built Environment Expert, involved primarily with the Design Review of schemes in the planning process. I am an active member of the UK Green Building Council, involved in a task group that recently published a report on alternative incentives for the Green Deal.1.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; I have some 60 publications to my name including the books Integrated Sustainable Design of Buildings which was published in 2011 by Earthscan; and Sustainable Retrofit and Facilities Management, published by Earthscan in 2013. These are comprehensive guides to sustainable design, masterplanning and construction, and the operation and refurbishment of existing buildings respectively: both intended for a global marketplace, but with a particular focus on the UK.&#xa0;

[[[Background]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Code for Sustainable Homes evolved from EcoHomes, which in turn evolved from the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM), which appeared originally in 1990 as a scheme for rating the predicted environmental performance of offices. None of these schemes were intended to replace Building Regulations nor to set legally enforceable standards. The aim was always to reward building designs that exceeded current regulations and norms. As a spin-off from this some of the performance criteria were designed to nudge legislators into improving performance standards. One example of this was the ‘Credits’ awarded for reduction in dwelling emission rates (DER) established as part of the Code for Sustainable Homes: one credit corresponding to a 8% reduction in predicted CO2 emissions compared with the target emission rate (TER) set in Part L1A of the Building Regulations; up to 10 credits for a predicted ‘net zero carbon home’.2.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This is confirmed in the preface to the 2010 version as follows:‘The Code for Sustainable Homes (CSH) is an environmental assessment method for rating and certifying the performance of new homes. It is a national standard for use in the design and construction of new homes with a view to encouraging continuous improvement in sustainable home building.’Although in my view the use of the term ‘standard’ in this context could be misconstrued, since I do not believe that an assessment scheme should be used as a standard, rather than as a means of testing a building against norms or regulations and rewarding those elements that exceed normal or required practice. 2.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; I note that the section in the Housing Standards Review (HSR) Consultation document dealing with Water Efficiency discusses the CSH requirements without recommending their being dropped. Indeed it recognizes that where there is a ‘clear local need’, e.g. local water shortages, the ‘Code Level 3’ criterion may be applied; which specifies a water consumption that is 15 litres/s per person per year lower than Part G of Building Regulations.2.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; CSH requirements are also referred to in the context of daylighting and materials, although in neither case is it recommended that they be incorporated into Housing Standards going forward.2.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; One cross-cutting issue that is referred to in the HSR Consultation but not in CSH is that of over-heating in homes. There is evidence that overheating of dwellings is not uncommon, particularly in towns and cities in the south of England. The risk factors are well known: exposure to solar and other heat gains, inadequate opportunities to ventilate naturally, prolonged high outdoor temperatures, particularly at night, and fabric that prevents heat escaping, for example. Current Building Regulations include an estimate of overheating risk in the SAP calculations required for Part L compliance and a requirement to be able to purge heat to comply with Part F.2.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Overheating can lead to extreme discomfort, heat stress and ultimately to death. However there is no epidemiological evidence that correlates indoor temperatures in dwellings to mortality rates. The statistics available show the relationship between outdoor temperature and deaths: indicating that as average outdoor temperatures over two days exceed 24.7˚C mortality starts to increase, perhaps doubling at around 35˚C.2.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Because of predicted climate change impacts and consequent increases in summertime temperatures, along with increased occupancy densities and heat islands in cities, there is a risk that incidences of overheating will increase. In higher spec new apartments this is already leading to the installation of air conditioning, or its retrofit in existing apartments. This clearly has escalating energy and carbon implications. 2.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There are also a number of CSH issues that are not referred to at all in the HSR Consultation. Specifically: Sound Insulation, global warming potential (GWP) of insulants, NOx emissions, surface water and flood risk, and ecology.2.9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Sound insulation is a surprising omission since it is currently covered by Approved Document E of the Building Regulations and CSH rewards improvements on the airborne and impact sound insulation values specified therein. These enhancements have significant impact on party floor and wall composition and associated performance and cost. Sound transmission between neighbouring dwellings can be a major cause of tension and I would have thought that the Government would take this opportunity to review this standard.2.10&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; GWP of insulants should strictly be considered under the heading of ‘materials impacts’, but in turn is an important element in the whole life greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions assessment of dwellings. Some would argue that decisions on insulation, environmental services and renewable energy strategies should be based on whole life GHG or carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. In this context it seems odd that there is no reference to the Passivhaus standard, which is gaining popularity as a framework for designing low energy buildings. With low operational carbon emissions embodied emissions become the greater influence on life cycle carbon performance.2.11&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; NOx emissions are contingent on type of heating fuel, combustion efficiency and flue arrangement. They are therefore intimately tied in with the energy/carbon assessment and renewables strategy. For example use of a biomass boiler can significantly reduce dwelling CO2 emissions but fail to meet the criteria for credits under the NOx heading in a CSH assessment. Housing Standards may not be a suitable vehicle for nudging the demand for biomass one way or the other however.2.12&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Surface water and flood risk are currently not within the scope of Building Regulations, but are covered by the planning process. Ecological impact associated with housing development is not governed by any current standards or legislation beyond that controlling development on green belt land or where land is designated with environmental protection, such as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).&#xa0;

[[[Recommendations]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; I do not believe that the Code for Sustainable Homes should ever have been brought under the auspices of the Department for Communities &amp; Local Government, since there has always been this confusion between regulatory requirements and a CSH assessment outcome. 3.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In my view CSH should be retained under the control of BRE alongside its BREEAM suite of assessment schemes, updated periodically as Building Regulations and technical advances demand. Perhaps CSH should revert back to its EcoHomes incarnation, whilst also incorporating the transport-related credits that were dropped when it became CSH. I would consider that this is in line with the HSR’s commitment to ‘wind down the role of the Code’ (para 40).3.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As Building Regulations demand lower operational carbon targets embodied carbon will become more critical in life cycle carbon performance. In my view future standards should factor in embodied carbon and more attention should be focussed on the embodied carbon of building products and the impact they have on whole life carbon.3.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In my view the Consultation does not give sufficient weight to the issue of overheating in dwellings. I think that this is an increasing problem, particularly in towns and cities in the south of England. It is also likely to increase the installation of air conditioning, which as heating energy use reduces will start to dominate annual carbon emissions. The method for determining cooling energy consumption currently incorporated into SAP is much simplified, based as it is primarily on the balance between solar gain and free cooling for 3 months of the year and 6 hours a day.
