"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Dr. Jonathan Morgan Corpus Christi College, University of Cambridge&#xa0;\nMilitary Casualties: Alternatives to Tort Compensation\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\nExecutive Summary\n&#xa0;\nThe Ministry of\n Defence should undertake to pay full tort damages for all deaths and injuries sustained during active operations\n on a no-fault basis\n, as the \nquid pro quo\n for removing the right to sue in \ntort (e.g. \nfor \nnegligence\n)\n.  (Crown immunity can be revived by the S\necretary of State’s making a suitable Order under the \nCrown Proceedings (Armed Forces) Act 1987\n; it has previously been suggested that this should be done to \nreverse \nSmith v. Ministry of Defence\n to avert that decision’s likely pernicious influence on milit\nary effectiveness.)\n&#xa0;\nAbout the Author\n&#xa0;\nDr. Jonathan Morgan is Fellow, Tutor and Director of Studies in Law at Corpus Christi College and University Lecturer in Tort Law, University of Cambridge.  He is active as a teacher and researcher in the fields of to\nrt and public law.  He is one of the editors of \nHepple and Matthews’ Cases and Materials on Tort\n.  Publications in the specific field of public authority liability include “\nPolicy reasoning in tort law: The courts, the\n Law Commission and the critics”\n (2009\n) 125 L\naw \nQ\nuarterly \nR\neview\n 215\n, and a case-note on the Court of Appeal’s decision in \nSmith v.
