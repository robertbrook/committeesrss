"&#xa0;\nSubmission from Giles BoardmanJust couldn't believe how one sided the 'investigation' was into the behavior of PCC it may as well have been an internal investigation.  My appeal into years of diabolical administration of our business rates by PCC was dismissed on the basis it was not 'maladministration' - when asked for the definition of this (as it clearly was and continues to be) I was informed that there is no definition despite it underpinning the 'work' of the LGO.  The allocation of payments made against a business rates account HAS TO go against the oldest invoice as per every rule in every business in this country, except for PCC.  The maladministration of this account in this way has led to extra costs, bailif visits and huge amounts of stress and upset.  We approached the LGO and they have simply shoved this under the carpet.  \nEither they do a proper job and explain their 'service' clearly or we simply shouldn't be paying for their existence as tax payers.  \nI asked for a call back from management and have never received one.  Utterly useless and pointless Quango.  The term 'public servant' used to mean something, apparantly now it's simply a code for over paid managers who efficiently sweep problems under carpets.\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
