defaultIntroduction
defaultThe MCI is grateful for the opportunity to submit comments to the Transport Committee’s inquiry into the Government’s ‘Action for Roads’ command paper. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis response represents the views of the UK motorcycle industry as represented by the MCI. The MCI represents over 90% of the supply side of the UK motorcycle industry. In 2010, the industry was worth over £7billion and employed over 62,000 people in over 6,000 businesses.

defaultThe DfT’s ‘Action for Roads’ command paper is seriously deficient, in that it 
defaultonly
default mention
defaults
default motorcycles, or Powe
defaultred Two Wheelers (PTW) twice and then only in relation to safety (1.51 &amp; 3.43)
default. However, we do note that there is a whole section dedicated to cycling, a mode of transport with comparable share of traffic on UK roads to motorcycling. This deficiency makes it difficult to comment on the Transport Committee’s specific questions, as there is no ‘benchmark’ within Action for Roads in relation to motorcycling that we can measure the paper by.
default&#xa0;
defaultMCI has previously and over many years, submitted responses to various consultations on ‘command’ transport policy, with this having little or no impact on the policy that emerges.
default&#xa0;
default In March 2013, MCI wrote to the DfT team responsible for the preparation of ‘Action for Roads’, but did not receive a reply to our requests for a discussion about PTWs in transport policy. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, Ministers during this and the previous Government
defaults
default have often spoken of the need to take account of PTWs in transport policy. Via various statements, remarks in response to questions at conferences and in answers to Parliamentary Questions they have indicated that motorcycling does indeed have a role to play in overall transport policy. Unfortunately, this rarely if ever translates into action from the DfT.
default&#xa0;
defaultA rare example of positive action was the launch of the Government’s Strategy for Motorcycling in 2005. This was indeed a useful example of what could be achieved and many of the actions proposed were fulfilled. However, it cannot be said that the 2005 Strategy ‘mainstreamed’ motorcycles in command transport policy and the motorcycle strategy process was dealt with separately from the area of command policy. It focussed predominantly on safety. As can clearly be seen in ‘Action for Roads’ the motorcycle strategy of 2005 has not been followed up or updated and the overall approach of ignoring the role of motorcycles in command policy continues. 
default&#xa0;
defaultGiven the disparity between ministerial statements and the actions of the DfT, MCI feels that the Transport Committee may find it interesting to explore defaultthe DfT’s defaultinstitutional defaultattitude defaulttowards PTWs.default&#xa0;
defaultMCI contends that the continued absence of 
defaultany specific consideration of 
defaultmotorcycling in command policies and strategies contributes towards a vulnerable environment for motorcycle users. In the area of road safety, MCI does work closely with DfT and officials engage in the issues often helpfully. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMCI will shortly be partnering ACPO and the DfT in a conference about road safety
default, focusing on the premise that more motorcycle usage will generate a safer road environment as awareness, respect and road sharing would become commonplace 
default. However, although concerned about safety issues (and rightly so), the DfT continues to fail to acknowledge the link between 
defaultsafety, transport integration and command policy
default – although this is a key feature of strategies to improve safety for cycling. 
default&#xa0;
defaultArguably, the absence of PTW policy areas in Action for Roads has denied an opportunity for the UK transport network/users to benefit from motorcycling’s zero congestion and lower Co2 credentials. 
default&#xa0;
defaultGovernment policy needs to finally properly ‘mainstream’ motorcycling as part of their overall transport policy. Motorcycling as a mainstream part of transport policy will add to the ‘toolkit’ of 
defaultl
defaultow cost sustainable commuting transport. This offers real choice and freedom to road users, who are currently constrained by an ideology which only sees walking, cycling and public transport as alternatives to the car. Motorcycles should be considered alongside cycling in policy due to their many shared positive characteristics. This can open the motorcycling option to many who struggle to afford medium and long distance transport by other means, or who find that public transport can’t serve their needs
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Transport Committee’s Questions;
default&#xa0;
defaultHow will the policies set out in the Government’s “Action for Roads” command paper improve the strategic road network for all road users, whilst also improving the environment
default?
defaultMotorcycling is 
defaultonly mentioned in relation to safety
default, therefore the command paper 
defaultarguably 
defaultdoes not improve the network for 
defaultall
default users. Specific aspects that relate to motorcycling, such as infrastructure design which takes account of 
defaultor facilitates powered two wheeler use
default, will therefore be 
defaultlikely to be 
defaultabsent
default in actions arising from the paper
default. Further detailed comments in relation to this are below.
default&#xa0;
defaultHow does the Government’s policy for roads link with planning for other transport modes?
defaultThere is no planning provision for motorcycling included within Government policy, other than a small amount for road safety. Motorcycling has a similar share of road traffic to cycling, yet is 
defaultlargely overlooked
default in ‘Action for Roads’. We would urge the Committee to ask the DfT why.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultHow reliable is the Government’s forecast for growth in demand for the strategic road network? How should the Government deal with uncertainty in its forecast?
default&#xa0;
defaultMCI has no specific comment to make
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultHow can we improve the reliability and efficiency of travel on the strategic road network? What impact will new technology have?
defaultThere are certain efficiencies that can be achieved in congested parts of the roads network, by supporting powered two wheeler use. A detailed case for this has been submitted to the DfT on several occasions, but this has been largely ignored. This area is further outlined within the comments from MCI below.
default Additionally, the industry is innovating, with increasing focus on R&amp;D for electric and alternative powered motorcycles.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat mechanisms are there for Government to increase investment in strategic roads and attract new investors? Are there good examples from other countries that could be applied in the UK? 
defaultMCI has no specific comment to make in this area, other than to remark that several countries in Europe and Scandinavia have considered road design and infrastructure initiatives which take account of the needs of powered two wheeler users. There is much to be learned from these examples.
default&#xa0;
defaultHow should the Highways Agency be reformed to make it “the world’s leading highway operator”? What roles should Government and the private sector play to ensure better management of the strategic road network?
defaultDuring the process of reform it would be 
defaultappropriate
default for the HA to consider how its future functions can support and recognise the role of powered two wheelers in traffic.
default&#xa0;
defaultUK Motorcycling
defaultBy far the largest sector of the 
defaultpowered two wheeler 
defaultmarket is occupied by motorcycles ideally suited for practical and commuting purposes (46% scooters or  standard type bikes). A growing sector is tourism and adventure travel, which 
defaultenjoys a good public profile via various TV shows and where safety has been less of a concern. Industry has also innovated, with enhanced safety aids, the emergence of fuel efficient larger machines and technological development taking place in the alternative powered sector.
default&#xa0;
defaultOverall, this represents a large shift of the market over the last ten years towards biking as transport. Some DfT travel estimates indicate that more than 60% of motorcycle mileage is now for practical purposes. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMCI contends that ‘Action for Roads’ is an opportunity lost.  It is time that motorcycling is brought in from the cold in policy terms and a proper consideration of what could be done to utilise thi
defaults mode of transport in comma
defaultnd policy. Plus of course consider how a more proactive policy could help further reduce casualties (which have been steadily falling for several years now, despite higher mileages being ridden compared to the 1990s)
default&#xa0;
defaultTfL
defaultTfL has indeed already taken this approach. The Mayor’s Roads Task Force has recognised and included the role of PTWs in transport policy in the 2013 document ‘The Vision and Direction for London’s Streets and Roads’ 
default&#xa0;
defaultOECD
defaultThe OECD has prioritised the integration of motorcycling in overall transport policy as a key factor in tackling motorcycle casualties.  This is because road safety campaigns and other activities aimed only at the rider can only go so far in solving the overall casualty problem.
default&#xa0;
defaultEnvironment
defaultMore motorcycling can help deliver the national goal of cleaner and lower Co2 transport. The industry and many users remain mystified about why successive Governments have failed to capitalise on the motorcycling opportunity.
default&#xa0;
defaultMotorcycles are already contributing to cleaner and more efficient transport. Motorcycles have a lower fleet average Co2 than cars (100‐110g/km Co2 compared to approx. 138-145g/km for the car fleet (ACEM) 
defaultMopeds can be considered as part of the ULE class of vehicles (Ultra Low Emission) Motorcycles
default also use fewer raw materials and less energy for the construction of a given model and there are lower recycling costs. Motorcycle used as practical transport helps to reduce overall pollution, particularly Co2. They do not congest traffic.
default&#xa0;
defaultEconomy
defaultA seven billion pound industry such as the motorcycle industry is not one which can be ignored or overlooked in either Transport policies, or in other Departmental policies, without such policies being deficient. The motorcycle industry is well placed to deliver jobs and growth with a focus on supporting efforts to rebalance the economy towards manufacturing, retail and export. Plus of course transport efficiency for commuters.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe UK motorcycle industry is of considerable size with net annual sales of almost £5.2 billion and has a significant impact on the UK economy, generating added value of more than £2 billion per annum. 
defaultThe industry directly employs 65,500 people in more than 6,350 businesses, which is more than each of the following: UK call centres; the market research sector; taxi driving, libraries, museums and other cultural activities.
default&#xa0;
defaultTherefore, motorcycling matters to the UK transport network, society and the economy. 
defaultAs the UK continues to create growth, the motorcycle industry’s potential to contribute to this should be recognised more broadly and in the area of transport, policy should be adapted to facilitate motorcycling and allow the industry to achieve its full potential.
