[[[Written evidence submitted by the New Schools Network]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;—&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; New Schools Network (NSN) is the only national charity which supports groups seeking to set up Free Schools. We aim to improve the quality of education – particularly for the most deprived – by increasing the number of new innovative, independent state-funded schools. We provide free advice and support to Free School applicant groups and have helped 70% of groups approved to open these schools.—&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Our support is available to anyone but NSN’s focus is on helping teacher, school, parent, charity and community groups to develop a high quality applications. —&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We have restricted our responses to those elements of the Inquiry most relevant to Free Schools and raised some key questions that will need to be considered to ensure that any system that approves and oversees academies – including Free Schools – in future does not limit the potential of these new schools to improve standards.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[2.1]]]&#xa0; The first Free Schools opened in September 2011 and early evidence suggests that they are achieving what the policy intended: creating good new local schools. Of the first 24 to open, 75% have been rated Good or Outstanding by Ofsted compared to 64% of Local Authority (LA) maintained schools inspected under the same regime during the same period. In an even closer comparison, half of new local authority schools that opened at the same time as the 2011 Free Schools were rated as good or outstanding under the new Framework. NSN believes that Free Schools will continue to raise standards both directly through the creation of good new schools and indirectly through the impact they have on surrounding schools because of the following factors.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[2.2]]]&#xa0; The opportunity to start a school from scratch has allowed teachers, charities, universities, independent schools and community groups (often in conjunction with parents) to bring new ideas and expertise into the state sector, creating schools which offer a new approach to meeting the needs of pupils in their area. Amongst others, schools have been set up by:&#xa0;—&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[41]]] parent/community groups, often in areas where new school places are needed such as Camden, Runcorn and Leeds;  —&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[37]]] groups of teachers, often in areas of high deprivation such as Greenwich, Knowsley and Sheffield; —&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[27]]] charities and existing education providers including the National Autistic Society, Everton Football Club and Southend YMCA;—&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[21]]] independent schools, including Manchester Grammar School, Brighton College and Eton College; and —&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Four]]] universities – including King’s College London and Exeter University.&#xa0;

[[[2.3]]]&#xa0; Around 70% of Free Schools have opened in areas where there is a need for new school places, but they are also providing new good school places in areas where existing schools are underperforming.  Introducing choice for parents has been an important rationale for many groups, with 45% of primary and 34% of secondary Free Schools opening in areas where the number of schools rated as ‘requires improvement’ or ‘inadequate’ is at or above the national average. &#xa0;

[[[2.4]]]&#xa0; New schools can act as a catalytic force, particularly thanks to the support they receive from local parents. The fact that parents, teachers, local businesses and other interested organisations can now demand, and set up, a new school – even where there is a surplus of places – challenges existing schools to reassess their own educational offer and attainment, helping to raise standards across the board. Anecdotally, we are already beginning to see the competitive impact of Free Schools influencing the behaviour of neighbouring schools. For example, since one primary Free School in Haringey started offering an extended day, a number of local primaries have followed suit. Similarly, since a Free School was approved to open on the Isle of Wight next year offering pupils Latin, several local secondary schools have also decided to offer it.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[2.5]]]&#xa0; Free Schools are leading educational innovation. Though all mainstream Free Schools must offer their pupils a broad and balanced curriculum, some of them take a different approach to teaching and learning. In many cases they are drawing on international best practice and adopting approaches from countries which consistently score highly in the PISA tests. Free Schools are now pioneering the use of: —&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; ‘Core Knowledge’ curricula, which are a feature of many top performing US states, is used by Pimlico Primary Academy to raise the cultural literacy of deprived pupils; —&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; ‘Forest School’ education, which is popular in Scandinavian countries, is being used by West Newcastle Academy to engage pupils and parents in one of the most deprived parts of the city; —&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; ‘Maths Mastery’, which is based on the approach Singaporean schools use to teach Maths, is now being across the ARK network of Free Schools; —&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Project based learning will be used in the XP School in Doncaster and is based on the success of ‘High Tech High’ in California; and—&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Bilingual curricula are being taught to students at Brighton Bilingual Primary School and the Judith Kerr School where half their studies are conducted in Spanish and German respectively. &#xa0;

[[[2.6]]]&#xa0; Initial indications also suggest that Free Schools are more likely to take advantage of Academy freedoms than traditional academies. In a recent NSN survey of mainstream Free Schools (2011 and 2012 openers), 82% of respondents said they make use of their freedom to offer a longer school day compared to 10% of Academies. &#xa0;

[[[2.7]]]&#xa0; As new schools, Free Schools have unparalleled opportunities to measure the impact of these alternative approaches and so make an important contribution to improving the quality of educational research in England. A number of Free Schools (like School 21 in Newham) are working with organisations like the Education Endowment Fund to do just that.&#xa0;

[[[ new Academy chains]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[2.8]]]&#xa0; The Free School policy is providing new ways for successful schools to expand their educational offering, and disseminate leadership and best practice across a wider network of schools. This is an area of significant growth. In 2011 existing state schools opened four of the free schools set up (17%); of those expected to open in 2014 that has risen to 41 schools (35%).&#xa0;

[[[2.9]]]&#xa0; In some cases, outstanding schools have set up Free Schools to replicate their existing models. For example, Perry Beeches, an ‘outstanding’ secondary school in Birmingham has been able to open two new schools in deprived parts of the city where parents have not previously had access to the same standard of education. In others, successful schools have been able to complement their existing provision by opening different phases or types of school. For example, in London, St Marylebone School has recently opened a Special school for pupils with speech, language and communication difficulties and Burlington Danes Academy will soon open a primary school to feed into its existing secondary school. And this growth hasn’t been limited just to Academies. Maintained schools have also taken advantage of the opportunity to open Free Schools. For example, school leaders in one of the most deprived parts of Barking and Dagenham recently opened the Riverside School, which will share a Head with the existing Sydney Russell school. They will open a new Special Free School in 2014. Similarly, in Slough a group of local Headteachers came together to form the SASH school to help to meet the critical need for new secondary school places in the town. &#xa0;

[[[2.10]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Free School policy has also allowed the best Academy chains to grow rapidly, with 45 multi-academy sponsors so far approved to open Free Schools, and to innovate within their chain. For example, from next year the Harris Federation will offer academically gifted sixth formers from London’s deprived inner boroughs the chance to study at a sixth form linked to Westminster School, while the Phoenix Family of Schools will be opening a bilingual primary Free School.&#xa0;

[[[2.11]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Finally with the policy starting to mature, we are seeing the emergence of the first Free School chains, with a number now looking to open a second or third school. For example, Canary Wharf College, one of the first ‘outstanding’ Free Schools, has recently been approved to open a second primary school while Khalsa Primary School, a Sikh ethos Free School in a deprived area of Leeds, has been approved to open another school in Bradford which will share its STEM focus.  &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Reaching]]]

[[[ the]]]

[[[ most disadvantaged ]]]&#xa0;

[[[2.12]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; NSN believes that Free Schools should be targeting the most deprived pupils and early evidence suggests they are. Free School Meal (FSM) data is available for 72 of the 81 schools that opened in 2011 or 2012 and 50% of these 72 schools have more students on FSM than their LA average. At Secondary this rises to 63%.&#xa0;

[[[2.13]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In some cases, existing schools are collaborating to find new solutions to longstanding challenges – the East Birmingham Network Free School for instance has been formed by local schools for pupils who have traditionally fallen out of education while the London Academy of Excellence has been set up by a group of independent schools to offer young people in Newham access to a high quality academic education. &#xa0;

[[[2.14]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The policy has also enabled dynamic groups of teachers to start schools in areas of high deprivation, often modelling themselves on some of the most successful urban Charter School chains, such as KIPP or Uncommon. Such motivation is behind Reach Academy Feltham and Greenwich Free School – both of which are led by teachers who use the same ‘no excuses’ approach, a longer school day and an emphasis on the education of pupils’ character to raise standards in those areas.

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Approval]]]

[[[3.1]]]&#xa0; Free Schools undergo a rigorous approval process, distinct from that for both converter and sponsored academies. This has evolved in every year since the programme began and has built on the experience of each of the five application waves. The tightening of this process was noted by the recent NAO report, which found that the DfE has, ‘incrementally improved its selection and pre-opening processes’.&#xa0;

[[[3.2]]]&#xa0; The current process is demanding, only 26% of applications submitted have been approved by the DfE. A full summary of each stage is included as an appendix but a brief outline is provided here. At the application stage groups have to:—&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Set out a strong vision for their school;—&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Develop detailed education, finance and governance plans and set out ambitious outcomes for their pupils;—&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Prove they have the capacity and capability – especially in educational expertise – to run a good school; and—&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Prove there is need and demand for the school in their community.&#xa0;

[[[3.3]]]&#xa0; This is not to say that further improvements cannot be made to the current approvals process to make it more rigorous. In particular NSN believes that greater expertise is needed when reviewing the governance elements of applications. With the growth of Multi-Academy Trusts (MATs) the complexity of governance arrangements is increasing and ensuring that groups have effective structures in place to govern new schools is critical.&#xa0;

[[[3.4]]]&#xa0; The fast growth of the Free Schools programme has also meant that the process has changed, often quite substantially, with each wave of applications. Having learned these lessons to create the more rigorous systems that are in place today, it will now be important to maintain these standards consistently.&#xa0;

[[[3.5]]]&#xa0; Once groups are approved to open a Free School, they enter a ‘pre-opening’ phase during which they have to meet further stringent targets if the school is to open. This includes developing comprehensive education plans and policies; building financial systems and recruiting pupils. They must also conduct a statutory consultation with the local community while the DfE conducts an assessment of the impact the project will have on other schools in the area.&#xa0;

[[[3.6]]]&#xa0; The DfE provides oversight and challenge to the project through a series of checkpoint meetings and, before being allowed to open, the school must be inspected by Ofsted to ensure premises and policies are up to standard. If the school is found to be unsatisfactory at any stage then the project may be cancelled or delayed.&#xa0;

[[[3.7]]]&#xa0; Although Local Authorities have no formal role in the approval of Free Schools, NSN encourages all groups we work with to make early contact with their LA. In many cases groups have been able to work collaboratively particularly around provision of data on places shortages and the identification of premises. While LAs cannot formally block the opening of a Free School, they can make submissions to a group’s public consultation or to the DfE’s impact assessment report during the pre-opening stage. For Special (and in some cases Alternative Provision) Free Schools, their support is essential since LAs must provide evidence of demand for their proposals. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Oversight and accountability ]]]&#xa0;

[[[3.8]]]&#xa0; Free schools are subject to greater examination than almost any other type of state-funded school. Not only are they subject to the same accountability framework as any Academy but they face additional levels of scrutiny. The political controversy which has surrounded the policy means that Free Schools are the subject of intense analysis from local and national media as well as other interest groups. Even more important, because parents have actively chosen a Free School, often before it even physically exists, they have high expectations of what the school will deliver and are more engaged in holding it to account.&#xa0;

[[[3.9]]]&#xa0; Once open, Free Schools have the same legal status as Academies which is formally set out in a Funding Agreement, signed by the Secretary of State and the Company Limited by Guarantee that operates the new academy. Free Schools are expected to adopt a model funding agreement which, amongst other things, states that they must follow the School Admissions Code, be inspected by Ofsted, publish their results and provide a broad and balanced curriculum, which cannot teach anything counter to fundamental British values, or creationism.&#xa0;

[[[3.10]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There is a seven year notice period in standard Free School funding agreements. If a Free School is found to be in breach of it any time before then, the Secretary of State has the power to terminate the agreement. This power has proved reasonably effective – it was the threat of terminating the funding agreement that allowed the DfE to take action in terms of the governance of Al-Madinah in Derby – requiring them to accept new management or face termination. It is worth noting however that there is no defined point at which an agreement is reviewed and, apart from this power to terminate, there is no power to intervene or pass management of a Free School or an academy to someone else. The need for these wider powers and the standard period of funding agreements should be reviewed to ensure that they allow swift and decisive action can be taken in cases where there are serious concerns about the school.&#xa0;

[[[3.11]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The EFA oversees the financial management and governance of Free Schools through a named contact for each school and who visits them in their first term. DfE Education Advisers also visit new schools in the autumn term of each of the first two years of operation. Finally, Ofsted inspects the school within two years of opening assessing against the same standards required of all state schools.  These assessments are used to identify potential risks to schools and risk rate each school, with particular concerns being escalated through further monitoring. It was through this route that the issues at Discovery New School in Crawley were identified and subsequently addressed.&#xa0;

[[[3.12]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Secretary of State can take a number of actions in relation to failing Free Schools:—&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Allow Ofsted to follow its standard processes for all state schools through subsequent inspection and monitoring; —&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Demand a comprehensive plan to address failure; —&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Intervene to appoint and remove governors; —&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Transfer the running of the school to a different Academy sponsor; or—&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Terminate the school’s funding agreement and close the school

[[[3.13]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Attention has been drawn to the weaknesses of a small number of the first Free Schools, which have been exposed either by inspection from Ofsted, investigation by the EFA or by individuals bringing matters to the attention of the DfE. In all cases the response has been both swift and practical. There is little evidence to suggest that intervention would have been any swifter if these schools had been subject to LA oversight – for instance there are currently more than 350 maintained schools in special measures, nearly a third of which have had that status for more than a year.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[4.1]]]&#xa0; If Free Schools are to reach their full potential in improving standards, using their academy freedoms, introducing innovation into the system, allowing outstanding providers to open new schools, encouraging competition and increasing the number of good school places in the system, it is important that both the approval and oversight systems to which Free Schools are subject are designed to protect and encourage their distinctive features and the unique addition they make to the schools system&#xa0;

[[[4.2]]]&#xa0; Underlying these distinctive features is the fact that new providers and innovations have the potential to raise educational standards by bringing challenge and competition to existing systems, even if this means creating a surplus of places. Any revisions to the approval and oversight systems, especially if they are designed to accommodate all academies or schools more widely, will therefore need to be carefully assessed to ensure they do not create unforeseen barriers or stifle the development and potential of the Free School programme in particular.&#xa0;

[[[4.3]]]&#xa0; This need is particularly acute when it comes to the 

[[[approvals]]] process where it is important to ensure that good schools continue to be approved to open where they are needed and wanted by local parents – including when they will be competing with existing underperforming provision.&#xa0;

[[[4.4]]]&#xa0; Local authorities and local schools, as providers with responsibility for managing and overseeing existing schools in a given region may be inclined to resist when it comes to considering the introduction of alternative schools that might challenge the status quo. In light of this, NSN believes the approval process for Free Schools should remain independent of Local Authorities and other local existing providers. While it is undeniable the Free School programme has a strong momentum behind it, the scale of growth, even in the medium term, is likely to be small enough that it should be possible to manage centrally.  &#xa0;

[[[4.5]]]&#xa0; Similarly, there are unique challenges in setting up an entirely new school and the right support and challenge is needed to ensure schools are set up to succeed not fail. Strong accountability and performance criteria are vital to the success of the Free School programme. In NSN’s view, the current framework is robust and, alongside the Ofsted systems that apply to all schools, has allowed the DfE/EFA/Ofsted to take swift and decisive action where necessary.  However, given the rate of growth in the number of Free Schools and academies more widely, the DfE’s capacity to monitor risks centrally and intervene where appropriate is becoming stretched so it is a sensible next step to fully review whether the current framework will remain fit for purpose.

[[[The ]]]

[[[current approval process]]]&#xa0;As it stands, the approval process falls broadly into two phases:&#xa0;

[[[The application phase ]]]Groups wanting to set up a Free School rightly have to complete a demanding application process. Aside from the first year of the programme – when groups completed a much briefer initial application and then received paid for support to turn this into a detailed business plan – all Free School applicants have had to undertake significant work without any financial support (except those receiving small grants from NSN). Currently, this includes:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;To gather evidence of demand, Mainstream Free School applicants must show that local parents, with children of relevant ages to attend the school when it opens, would choose it as a first choice, were it to open. Special and AP Free School applicants must show that they have both the support of relevant parents/young people and in principle financial commitments from relevant commissioners to purchase places at the school, over and above the central funding (£10,000 and £8,000 respectively) available to them. Ideally, applicants have to show that the school would be several times oversubscribed in its first two years of operation.&#xa0;Once submitted, these applications are assessed by dedicated teams at the DfE/EFA and, where they have been submitted by an existing Academy sponsor, discussed with the Academies division to analyse the sponsor’s capacity to expand further.&#xa0;Following this, a number of applicants are invited for interview by a panel which includes representatives from the DfE, EFA, external educational advisers and independent experts. &#xa0;The rigour of the application phase can be seen in’ the relatively low success rate of applicants, with only 26% of the 1103 applications received by the DfE being progressed to the pre-opening phase. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[The pre-opening phas]]]

[[[e]]]If successful at interview, groups are then provisionally ‘approved’ to open a Free School. Groups receive funding from the DfE (currently £220,000 for primary schools and £300,000 for secondary/all-through schools) in order to ensure the school ready to open – including recruiting staff, developing education plans and policies, building financial systems and recruiting pupils. They must also conduct a statutory consultation with the local community to ask whether stakeholders believe the school should open, and respond to any concerns.&#xa0;Groups also receive substantial support at this stage with finding, securing and developing a site with the EFA taking all key decisions. Aside from this, the role of the DfE is largely to provide oversight and challenge to the project – through a dedicated project lead, education and finance advisers, who hold regular checkpoint meetings to review its progress. If this is found to be unsatisfactory at any stage then the project may be cancelled, or the opening of the school delayed. &#xa0;Before being allowed to open, the school must also pass two further requirements. First, it is inspected by Ofsted to ensure that it meets necessary standards around the quality of its premises and the provision of policies relating to issues such as the welfare, health and safety of pupils. Secondly, DfE officials must conduct an assessment of the Free School’s impact on other schools in the area. Only at this stage, if all other requirements have been fulfilled, will the Secretary of State sign a funding agreement with the school which allows it to formally open. &#xa0;&#xa0; Of the 24 Free Schools which opened in 2011: four were rated outstanding; 14 were rated good; five required improvement and one was inadequate. Comparative data here: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/256056/131107_Letter_to_Baroness_Jones_of_Whitchurch.pdf NAO Establishing Free Schools Report (December 2013) http://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/10314-001-Free-Schools-Book.pdf Based on analysis of data from Ofsted dataview (http://dataview.ofsted.gov.uk/) as at October 2013 Broadly, Forest schools use outdoor education in which pupils learn personal, social and technical skills such as team building and risk management in a forest or woodland area. Some elements of the curriculum can be delivered outside and forest schools follow a model of child initiated learning with a focus on building a relationship between the pupil and the natural world. Reform report – Plan A+: Unleashing the potential of academies (March 2012) by Dale Bassett et al.  Comparisons are with number of Academies that have used or plan to use these freedoms Full information on this survey can be found in the NSN data release http://www.newschoolsnetwork.org/sites/default/files/Free%20School%20data%20release%20-%20FINAL_0.pdf This is based on NSN’s internal data-gathering. Schools self-identify their nature. Data downloaded from Edubase November 2013: http://www.education.gov.uk/edubase/home.xhtml KIPP Schools (Knowledge is Power Partnership) base their model on the belief that every student can learn and achieve regardless of background. Teachers and leaders are focussed on the over-riding goal of preparing KIPP students to “succeed in college and live choice filled lives.” Uncommon run high performing Charter Schools in New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts and focus on giving every student the opportunity of a college education, naming their classrooms after top colleges such as Harvard and Yale. They focus on developing outstanding teaching and teachers as the most important driver of student attainment. http://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/10314-001-Free-Schools-Book.pdf The model funding agreement for Free Schools can be accessed here: http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/leadership/typesofschools/freeschools/b00222077/pre-opening/funding-agreement.
