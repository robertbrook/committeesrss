Since completing \nmy\n PhD in 2000 at age 25 \nI have\n moved cities four times \nto progress my career. T\nhree of \nthese moves \nhave been\n in\nternational. \nMy\n cu\nrrent contract is for two years and I expect \nthat\n at least one more national or international move\n will be necessary\n.\n \nMy\n partner currently lives \n16 741 km away in Melbourne, Australia. \nWe do not have children. \n&#xa0;\nMy female peers who \nobtained their PhDs in the same year as me but who chose to have children have all left academia\n. Decisions to find different careers\n were usually ma\nde before the birth of a child \nwhen the realization \nthat \npursuing an academic career\n would mean \nyears of tr\nansient living, living in a different city or country to their partner and giving up the possibility of having a family.\n              \n              \n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEvidence\n&#xa0;\nWhen do most women drop out?\nHow does the academic early-to-mid career path affect women?\n&#xa0;\nMarie Curie Fellowships \n[Fellows]\n must not undertake their fellowship in the country of their nationality or recent centre of activity. \n&#xa0;\nEMBO Fellowships \nAll applications must involve movement between countries. The receiving institute or the applicant’s nationality must be from one of the EMBC Member States. Applications to go to the country in which the PhD was obtained will not be \nconsidered. Applications for a Long-Term Fellowship to be held in the laboratory, institute or department in which the candidate worked to obtain his or her PhD, or to work again with the candidate's PhD supervisor, no matter where the latter is located, w\nill not be considered.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHuman Frontiers \nThe following are \nineligible\n: (1) Applicants who \nhave spent 12 or mor\ne months in the proposed host country. The combined duration of all previous research-related stays in the host country is taken into account and cannot exceed 12 months at the start of the fellowship. The sole exception to this rule are visits of less tha\nn one month to the host country as part of formal undergraduate education (up to the Bachelor degree level). (2)\n Applicants who… \nhave spent a total of 12 months (consecutive or not) with their proposed host supervisor.  (3)\n \nApplicants who started their cur\nrent work in the proposed host institution or host country prior to 1 April 2013. (4)\n Applications to work with: \nformer scientific collaborators; former research supervisors; scientists with whom the applicant has published; and scientific colleagues/super\nvisors. \n&#xa0;\nWellcome Trust BioMedical Fellowships \nThe fellowship should normally include periods in more than one laboratory, either in the UK or overseas. There is no time limit on the amount of time spent outside the sponsoring institution. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nR\necommendations\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nNewsome JL 2012The chemistry PhD: the impact on women’s retention UK Resource Centre for Women in SET http://www.biochemistry.org/Portals/0/SciencePolicy/Doc\ns/Chemistry Report For Web.pdf\n \nETAN Report 2000 Science Policies in the European Union: Promoting Excellence through Mainstreaming Gender Equality, European Commission, 2000, http://cordis.europa.e\nu/improving/women/documents.htm\n \nGoulden M, Frasch K and Mason MA 2009 Staying Competitive: Patching America’s Leaky Pipeline in the Sciences Centre for American Progress http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/200\n9/11/pdf/women_and_sciences.pdf\n \nWilliams WM and Ceci SJ 2012 When Scientists Choose Motherhood American Scientist http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/2012/2/wh\nen-scientists-choose-motherhood\n \nhttp://cordis.europa.eu/impr\noving/fellowships/mcf_cat30.htm\n \nhttp://www.embo.org/funding-awards/fe\nllowships/long-term-fellowships\n \nhttp://www.hfsp.org/funding/post\ndoctoral-fellowships/guidelines\n \nhttp://www.wellcome.ac.uk/Funding/Biomedical-science/Funding-schemes/Fellowships/Basic-biome\ndical-fellowships/wtx033549.htm\n"
