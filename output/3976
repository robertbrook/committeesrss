defaultWritten evidence submitted by the Welsh Language Commissioner (JRR 0036)default&#xa0;
defaultThe Welsh Language Commissioner welcomes the opportunity to comment on the 
defaultimplications for
default 
defaultaccess to justice
default 
defaultof the Government's 
defaultproposals to reform judicial review
default. This comme
defaultnt should be taken as evidence to assist the Joint Committee on Human Rights in scrutinising the Government's proposals in an area where meeting the needs of individuals, including their languages needs, is integral to the quality and effectiveness of serv
defaultices. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe principal aim of the Commissioner is to promote and facilitate the use of Welsh. This entails raising awareness of the official status of the Welsh language in Wales and imposing standards on organisations. This, in turn, will lead to the estab
defaultlishment of rights for Welsh speakers. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTwo principles underpin the Commissioner's work: 
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn Wales, the Welsh language should be treated no less favourably than the English language; 
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPersons in Wales should be able to live their lives through the medium 
defaultof the Welsh language if they choose to do so. 
defaultIn due course, secondary legislation will introduce new powers allowing the setting and imposing of standards on organizations. Until then, the Commissioner will continue to inspect statutory Welsh language s
defaultchemes through the powers inherited under the Welsh Language Act 1993.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe role of the Commissioner was created by the Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011. The Commissioner may investigate failure to implement a language scheme; interference with the free
defaultdom to use Welsh in Wales and, in future, complaints regarding the failure of organizations to meet standards. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOne of the Commissioner's priorities is to scrutinise Welsh language policy developments, acting as an independent advocate on behalf of Welsh 
defaultspeakers in Wales. This evidence is provided to the Joint Committee on Human Rights in that capacity.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Commissioner’s comments, and the issues which the Joint Committee may wish to address, may be summarised as follows:-
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are many references in th
defaulte Government's recommendations (
defaultJudicial Review: proposals for further reform
default) 
defaultto assessing the impact of the proposed changes on various groups, as well as assessing the impact in accordance with the Ministry for Justice's duties under the Equality Act 2010. In terms of the Welsh language, there is no specific mention of it in the c
defaultonsultation documentation. 
defaultThe Government's proposalsdefault defaultraise fundamental questions on access to justice.default 
defaultThe Welsh Language Commissioner believes that the Government should not introduce any changes without first considering the significance of the plans todefault minority groups, including Welsh speakers.default&#xa0;
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are already arrangements in place in Welsh courts (as noted in Section 22 of the Welsh Language Act 1993) which allow individuals to speak Welsh during court cases (including judicial review hearings), tra
defaultnslating those contributions and related papers into English for those in court who do not understand Welsh. However, Welsh language provision in courts is often fragmented and arbitrary. 
defaultFurther to the above comment, it should be ensured that the Courts adefaultnd defaultTribunals Service offers Welsh language servicedefaults in a proactive defaultmanner, in accordance with the Welsh Language Act 1993 and the Welsh Language Schemes prepared by the Courts and Tribunals Service and Ministry for Justice.default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Joint Committee on Human Rights will normally, when scrutinising British legislation, consider
default the sufficiency of considerations relating to human rights and equality legislation. 
defaultWe ask, where appropriate, for the Joint Committee to consider to what extent the Government's proposals are defaultcompatibledefault with the Welsh Language Act 1993 and the Welsh Landefaultguage (Wales) Measure 2011.default 
defaultThank you once again for the opportunity to contribute to this consultation. I look forward to continuing to work closely with the Joint Committee on Human Rights.
