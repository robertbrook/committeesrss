[normal]Written evidence submitted by the Welsh Language Commissioner (JRR 0036)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Welsh Language Commissioner welcomes the opportunity to comment on the 
[normal]implications for
[normal] 
[normal]access to justice
[normal] 
[normal]of the Government's 
[normal]proposals to reform judicial review
[normal]. This comme
[normal]nt should be taken as evidence to assist the Joint Committee on Human Rights in scrutinising the Government's proposals in an area where meeting the needs of individuals, including their languages needs, is integral to the quality and effectiveness of serv
[normal]ices. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The principal aim of the Commissioner is to promote and facilitate the use of Welsh. This entails raising awareness of the official status of the Welsh language in Wales and imposing standards on organisations. This, in turn, will lead to the estab
[normal]lishment of rights for Welsh speakers. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Two principles underpin the Commissioner's work: 
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In Wales, the Welsh language should be treated no less favourably than the English language; 
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Persons in Wales should be able to live their lives through the medium 
[normal]of the Welsh language if they choose to do so. 
[normal]In due course, secondary legislation will introduce new powers allowing the setting and imposing of standards on organizations. Until then, the Commissioner will continue to inspect statutory Welsh language s
[normal]chemes through the powers inherited under the Welsh Language Act 1993.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The role of the Commissioner was created by the Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011. The Commissioner may investigate failure to implement a language scheme; interference with the free
[normal]dom to use Welsh in Wales and, in future, complaints regarding the failure of organizations to meet standards. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]One of the Commissioner's priorities is to scrutinise Welsh language policy developments, acting as an independent advocate on behalf of Welsh 
[normal]speakers in Wales. This evidence is provided to the Joint Committee on Human Rights in that capacity.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Commissioner’s comments, and the issues which the Joint Committee may wish to address, may be summarised as follows:-
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There are many references in th
[normal]e Government's recommendations (
[normal]Judicial Review: proposals for further reform
[normal]) 
[normal]to assessing the impact of the proposed changes on various groups, as well as assessing the impact in accordance with the Ministry for Justice's duties under the Equality Act 2010. In terms of the Welsh language, there is no specific mention of it in the c
[normal]onsultation documentation. 
[normal]The Government's proposals[bold] [bold]raise fundamental questions on access to justice.[bold] 
[normal]The Welsh Language Commissioner believes that the Government should not introduce any changes without first considering the significance of the plans to[bold] minority groups, including Welsh speakers.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There are already arrangements in place in Welsh courts (as noted in Section 22 of the Welsh Language Act 1993) which allow individuals to speak Welsh during court cases (including judicial review hearings), tra
[normal]nslating those contributions and related papers into English for those in court who do not understand Welsh. However, Welsh language provision in courts is often fragmented and arbitrary. 
[normal]Further to the above comment, it should be ensured that the Courts a[bold]nd [bold]Tribunals Service offers Welsh language service[bold]s in a proactive [bold]manner, in accordance with the Welsh Language Act 1993 and the Welsh Language Schemes prepared by the Courts and Tribunals Service and Ministry for Justice.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is not clear from the Govern
[normal]ment's recommendations what
[normal] 
[normal]criteria
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]Government
[normal] 
[normal]intends to
[normal] 
[normal]use in order to ensure that
[normal] 
[normal]legal support
[normal] 
[normal]resources are
[normal] 
[normal]'properly targeted 
[normal]at
[normal] 
[normal]those judicial review cases
[normal] where they are needed
[normal] 
[normal]most
[normal]?' 
[normal]We ask for assurances that no [bold]reforms[bold] will undermine the a[bold]vailability of legal services and resources to individuals or parties who wish to submit an application for[bold],[bold] or co[bold]nduct a judicial review hearing[bold] in Welsh.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Joint Committee on Human Rights will normally, when scrutinising British legislation, consider
[normal] the sufficiency of considerations relating to human rights and equality legislation. 
[normal]We ask, where appropriate, for the Joint Committee to consider to what extent the Government's proposals are [bold]compatible[bold] with the Welsh Language Act 1993 and the Welsh Lan[bold]guage (Wales) Measure 2011.[bold] 
[normal]Thank you once again for the opportunity to contribute to this consultation. I look forward to continuing to work closely with the Joint Committee on Human Rights.
