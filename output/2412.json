"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Habinteg&#xa0;&#xa0;\nHabinteg welcomes the opportunity to respond to the House of \nCommons Work and Pensions Select Committee’s inquiry into the ‘provision of support to meet housing costs in the reformed welfare system’. This response concentrates particularly on the implications of changes to support for housing costs for disabled peop\nle and, in particular, Habinteg tenants. We take into account changes as a result of the introduction of Universal Credit\n (UC)\n and other changes to housing support costs. We also respond to the committee’s request for information on the implications of the\n changes for housing providers, and for information on responses to the changes. As a housing provider, Habinteg presents information drawn from our own experience.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHabinteg is a housing \nassociation\n with more than 40 years’ experience pro\nviding homes and services to disabled and non-disabled tenants. \n&#xa0;\n2.1\n              \nHabinteg champions inclusion by working to:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nThe social model of disability is crucial to every aspect of Habinteg’s work. We believe that people are disabled by barriers in society and negative public attitudes, rather than by their own \nimpairments.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n              \nHabinteg operates across \nmore than\n 80 local authorities in England and Wales and manages over 3,300 homes. Of these more than 1,200 are designed for wheelchair users with the rest being designed to Lifetime Homes standards. Over 59 per ce\nnt of our tenants (April 2012) tell us that they define themselves as disabled people.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTo appreciate fully the impact of reductions in support for housing costs on disabled people it is important to understand \nthe context in which these cuts are taking place. This particularly means the housing needs and housing-related costs of disabled people. \n&#xa0;\n3.1\n&#xa0; \nWe draw attention to the following:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHabinteg believes that current changes to \nsupport f\no\nr\n housing costs will further impoverish disabled people. In particular, they threaten to render important aspects of housing unaffordable. They will also place real strains on the ability of housing providers to meet the needs of disabled people.\n&#xa0;\n4.1&#xa0; \nBedroom Tax &#xa0;We firstly address the issue of the bedroom tax.\n&#xa0;\n4.1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDisabled people and bedroom tax\n&#xa0;\nThe government’s own equality impact assessment of the spare room subsidy policy accepted that the majority of those affected by a cut to Housing Benefit via this rout\ne would be disabled people\n and that the average financial loss would be £14 a week across the total 660,000 people affected. The decision to continue on with this policy despite this evidence of disproportionate impact seems perverse. The ‘bedroom tax’ ru\nle that Housing Benefit will be reduced by 14 per cent if a person is deemed to have one bedroom too many and by 25 per cent if two or more bedrooms has been subject to a number of challenges by disabled people\n. As a result, room space above the criteria \ncan continue to be covered by Housing Benefit in certain circumstances, specifically where it can be demonstrated through medical evidence that disabled children require an additional bedroom or where a disabled person requires space for an overnight carer\n (but only where that person is not their spouse). This left disabled adults unable to share a room because of disability or who needed additional space still subject to the bedroom tax. Tribunal hearings in Scotland during September 2013\n, however, agreed\n with disabled adult claimants that their ‘spare’ rooms were too small to count as bedrooms and space was needed for reasons linked to impairment. Although these rulings do not constitute a legal precedent, they are important legal indications and point to\n the strong feeling that the bedroom tax is unworkable\n and unfair\n. \n&#xa0;\n4.1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nImpact on Habinteg tenants\n&#xa0;\nHabinteg has around 553 households in properties that will be subject to the under-occupancy rule. Of these, 240 are wheelchair standard properties. Therefore \nof all properties and tenants affected by the under-occupancy rule and who will experience a cut in housing \nsupport\n Habinteg estimates that 43 per cent are wheelchair accessible properties. This does not mean that only 43 per cent of those \nHabinteg tenant\ns \nwho will experience a financial loss are disabled people, as many \npeople living in\n other properties will also be disabled people. However, it is important to identify the particular impact on those tenants in properties specifically designed for wheelcha\nir users as such properties are in very short supply. As stated above, Habinteg tenants occupying wheelchair accessible properties have often waited several years before finding suitable accommodation. If tenants are forced to leave their current homes bec\nause they are unable to afford the rent, the prospect of finding small wheelchair accessible properties is limited.\n&#xa0;\n4.1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFinancial impact – arrears \n&#xa0;\nThe impact of the bedroom tax on Habinteg tenants was felt quickly in the form of increased rent arrears. Over\nall Habinteg has a very good record in collecting rents and supporting tenants to keep arrears low\n. At the time of writing Habinteg is in the process of updating its data on arrears\n so can only give limited figures at present. On this basis we are able to\n identify an increase in arrears \nof £\n8,058 by those tenants identified as under-occupying under benefit rules in the four months between April and July 2012.\n&#xa0;\n4.1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHabinteg’s response to the changes\n&#xa0;\nHabinteg does not agree with the bedroom tax. As a response t\no housing shortage it fails to recognise that alternative smaller properties are often simply not available, while treating tenants in receipt of Housing Benefit differently from other tenants. We are particularly concerned about the policy’s disproportion\nate impact on disabled people and introduction apparently without thought or understanding of why disabled people may need more space in their home. However, while making our concerns known – including by engagement with inquiries such as this – we are obl\niged to work with the policy. In this context, Habinteg, while lobbying against the policy, has taken a number of steps to help tenants faced with a cut in Housing Benefit as a result of the bedroom tax. This has included:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOutcome of responses\n&#xa0;\nThe outcome of these steps is mixed. As identified above, arrears have risen and it is too early to be clear on the exact trend and how far\n rising arrears can be limited.\n \nAt the time of writing Habinteg has been o\nbliged to serve notice on 12 tenants in arrears purely attributable to the bedroom tax. We are very aware that many\n Habinteg tenants \nwill be\n subject to the compound effect of multiple cuts to benefits\n, some still to come into effect,\n and the significance o\nf lost income through the bedroom tax has to be understood in the context of these. \n&#xa0;\nWith regard to exempt status, \n516\n \nof approximately 1200 \nHabinteg \nwheelchair accessible standard \nproperties have so far been granted exempt status by loc\nal authorities. As\n this decision is made by individual local authorities, however, results vary, with households and properties in very similar positions being granted exempt status in one authority but denied in another. \nSome local authorities are only considering exemptio\nn in relation to under-occupation status, requiring further applications to be attempted for other circumstances when appropriate. This leaves households in an insecure position. \n&#xa0;\nWith regard to DHP, as these applications are made by the tenant not the ho\nusing provider, we have less complete data on the outcomes. Again, however, we are aware of extreme variation in the result of applications. Tenants with very similar circumstances have been granted time limited DHP in \none authority and refused in another\n.\n Research by Papworth Trust found that one in three disabled applicants were being refused DHP\n. \nDHP is also temporary and again this leaves households in an insecure position.\n&#xa0;\n4.1.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nImpact on Habinteg\n&#xa0;\nHabinteg’s survival – and its continued ability to provide and promote accessible housing – depends on its rental income. Rising arrears will present the organisation with unpalatable options: increasing rents for all tenants; evicting tenants (even those \nwho may not previously have been in arrears and who try hard to pay their rent); accumulating debt and placing the organisation at unacceptable risk. Habinteg has had to allocate very significant resources to helping tenants understand and cope with the be\ndroom tax, and other changes to housing support. \n&#xa0;\n4.2&#xa0; \nService charges and Universal Credit&#xa0;Changes introduced under Universal Credit threaten to impact negatively on the independence, mobility and health of disabled people. \n&#xa0;\n4.2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDisabled people and service char\nges\n&#xa0;\nNew guidance issued by the Department for Work and Pensions  render\ns\n service charges for \nmaintenance of disability related aids and adaptations \nineligible for repayment through U\nC\n. Ineligible service charges specifically include: ‘Installation, maint\nenance or repair of any special equipment or adaptations to the tenant’s accommodation in respect of disability or infirmity of tenants’\n. A service contract is essential to ensure that aids and adaptations (e.g. through-floor lifts, stairlifts, hoists, do\nor openers, specialist baths) are kept in good working order and are safe to use. Removing service charges from repayment will have a very serious impact on many disabled people. It may make such equipment unaffordable and thereby severely limit mobility, \nindependence within the home and ability to carry out carry out personal care and domestic tasks.\n As well as the potential financial implications, s\nuch changes may have both negative physical and psychological impacts.\n&#xa0;\nThe guidance changes what has been t\nhe established practice whereby service charges were recouped under Housing Benefit. The DWP suggests that service charges can be funded through grant funding, such as Disabled Facilities Grants\n (DFGs)\n. However, \nmany DFG grants do not include a maintenance element and even if such an element is included it is time limited, with the maximum period being five years in our experience. \nEven if an individual’s DFG included funding for that period, thereafter there woul\nd be no funding and responsibility would move to the individual. It must be remembered that research shows that current need for adaptations funding outstrips DFG funds by a ratio of about ten to one\n. Habinteg, like other housing associations, provides fo\nr servicing as part of risk management in order to ensure that equipment stays safe and thereby tenants and any carers or assistants are safe in operating equipment. \n&#xa0;\n4.2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nImpact on Habinteg tenants\n&#xa0;\nU\nC\n has yet to be rolled out, and these changes to the fundin\ng of service charges will impact on Habinteg tenants piecemeal if/when they transfer to UC. What we know at the moment is that Habinteg currently has 1427 properties subject to service charges for relevant equipment. It is not uncommon for properties to ha\nve multiple items. The service charges range from 55p per week to £31.33 per week. These charges cover such things as periodic health and safety testing and servicing, some of which is mandatory, and insurance cover. It does not include minor adaptations w\nork and general responsive maintenance, which are covered by rent. It is easy to see from this range of charges that if funding is removed and tenants have to find money to pay, arrears could rise rapidly. Tenants might decide to go \nwithout adaptations, as\nk for adaptations to be removed, or try to risk not maintaining equipment. All these options pose tenants with risk and limits to their independence, safety and health.\n&#xa0;\n4.2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFinancial impact \n&#xa0;\nThe total annual amount due to Habinteg of service charges is £223,\n000 plus 15 per cent on\n-\ncost. From this it is clear that if UC removes the service charges’ funding that was available under Housing Benefit th\nere\n is a major threat to housing providers as well as disabled people. The impact on Habinteg stands out quite dr\namatically as our housing is delivered on a mainstream model, with disabled and non-disabled tenants living independently in our housing. At the same time, because our homes are accessible and there is a dire shortage of accessible housing, a large proport\nion of our tenants are disabled. Due to this it is possible to see clearly the impact of this change on disabled people, and the impact on housing providers.\n&#xa0;\n4.2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHabinteg’s response to the changes\n&#xa0;\nHabinteg has strongly argued against the new guidance, engagi\nng with the consultation in January 2013, meeting with DWP officials and liaising with others in the sector. We have devoted significant resources to clarifying our exact financial information and discussions are on-going on handling the impact of this ret\nrograde step, should it proceed. \n&#xa0;\nWe have also taken some early awareness raising steps about this sensitive and difficult issue. The change was raised at Habinteg’s National Tenant Forum and at the organisation’s Homes and Services Committee, which has t\nenant representation. Information has featured in publications to tenants.\n&#xa0;\nHabinteg i\ns strongly opposed to limiting benefits that are\n essential for maintaining vital aids and adaptations. As already outlined, these aids support the independence of disable\nd people. In the process they secure cost-effective alternatives to expensive residential care. \n&#xa0;\nHabinteg strongly urges the Work and Pensions Committee to do all it can to raise awareness of this change, its likely impact on the independence and choice of disabled people, and request ministers to reconsider.  &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.3 Direct payment of housing costs to tenants&#xa0;\nThe direct payment of housing costs to tenants has raised concerns among housing organisations, domestic abuse organisations and disability organisations, among others, about the potential for exploitation, victimisation and increased debt. Habin\nteg shares these concerns and is taking efforts to support tenants and to try to limit the growth of arrears. \n&#xa0;\n4.3.1 Habinteg asked those tenants in receipt of Housing Benefit how they would prefer to receive it – direct to them or to Habinteg. From this,\n 83 per cent said they would like \npayments to continue to be made to Habinteg, with only 8 per cent choosing payment to them\n. \n&#xa0;\n4.3.3 While we have major concerns about the impact of direct payments in increasing debt, triggering evictions and escalating \nindividual and household problems, we have worked hard to ensure that tenants are supported in advance of the changes. Habinteg has been:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;4.4&#xa0; \nLocalised Council Tax Support&#xa0;\nLocalisation of Council Tax Support will cre\nate a postcode lottery. Instead of standard criteria that apply across the UK, it will mean that a person with a particular set of circumstances will be considered too poor to pay Council Tax in one area but well-off enough in another area. According to th\ne Joseph Rowntree Foundation, 2.4 million low-income families will pay on average £138 more in council tax in the year 2013/14\n.\n              \n4.4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nImpact on Habinteg tenants\n&#xa0;\nHabinteg has partial information collected from visits to and contact with tenants, but does not yet have comprehensive data on the impact of localisation of council tax support. We are concerned that localisation, alongside a 10 per cent cut in funding fr\nom central government to local authorities, will mean that many people who previously received support will not do so and that this will cause hardship. We estimate that many tenants who previously had support will have to find between £3 and £6 a week for\n Council Tax. Again, this change will take place alongside other reductions in income due to benefit cuts and restrictions in eligibility. \n&#xa0;\n4.4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFinancial impact \n&#xa0;\nIt will be some time before we can aggregate data and calculate the impact of this particular cu\nt on Habinteg in the form of arrears etc.\n&#xa0;\n4.4.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHabinteg’s response\n&#xa0;\nAs with other changes, Habinteg has embarked on a programme of awareness raising combined with practical support.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe impact of changes to housing support outlined here represent\n intensified hardship and inequality for disabled people in particular. Habinteg is concerned about the impact on all its tenants in receipt of benefit, but wish to draw the Committee’s attention to the added impact that policies such as the bedroom tax an\nd the cuts to funding of service charges for disability adaptations will have on the lives of disabled people.\n&#xa0;\n5.1\n              \nHabinteg would be happy to discuss these matters further with the Committee and hopes that the information provided is useful. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n26 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://odi.dwp.gov.uk/disability-statistics-and-research/disability-facts-and-figures.php#gd\n \nhttp://www.pssru.ac.uk/pdf/rs035.pdf\n \nhttps://www.iser.essex.ac.uk/publications/working-papers/iser/2012-09.pdf\n \nhttp://odi.dwp.gov.uk/disability-statistics-and-research/disability-facts-and-figures.php#imp\n \nDepartment for Education (DfE), 2010, Child\nren with Special Educational Needs 2010: An analysis, Department for Education.\n \nFamily Resources Sur\nvey, 2008-2009.\n \nhttp://odi.dwp.gov.uk/dis\nability-statistics-and-research/disability-facts-and-figures.php#22\n \nLater Life in the United Kingdon, Ageuk, April 2013, based on \nShelter \nanalysis\n.\n \nhttp://odi.dwp.gov.uk/disability-statistics-and-research/disability-facts-and-figures.php#ho\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/220154/eia-social-sector-housing-under-occupation-wr2011.pdf\n For example, \nBurnip v Birmingham City Council &amp; Anor [2012] EWCA Civ 629 (15 May 2012)\n, and \nMA &amp; ors v Secretary of \nState for Work and Pensions QBD 30.7.1\n3\n \n \nhttp://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/bedroom-tax-ray-hope-thousands-2263218\n Significantly higher \nnumbers of Habinteg tenants formally meet the criteria to be deemed as under-occupying but either do not receive Housing Benefit or are exempted because they are over state pension age.\n Arrears 2012-13 is 5.6 per cent of total rent owed, with 4.45 per ce\nnt of this being arrears owed by current tenants.
