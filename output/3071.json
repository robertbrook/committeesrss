"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Brampton A14 Campaign Group (SRN 039)Q. How will the policies set out in the Government’s “Action for Roads” command paper improve the strategic road network for all road users, whilst also improving the environment?A. Government policies will only be effective if the Highways Agency adheres to them.  Reasoning1. T\nhe \nDfT Strategic Roads Network Performance \nSpecification 2013-2015 s\nets out performance expectations for the strategic road network and Highways Agency for the period 2013 to 2015.\n2. Efficiency and Value for Money -  \nOutput 9 (Efficiency) states:  The network operator should manage its business in\n an efficient and effective way \nand \nensure investment offers \nstrong value for money\n.\nThe network operator should also report\n the \npercentage\n of appraised \nmajor \nproject spend which is assessed as good or very good value for money\n as this is currently a \nDepartment for Transport Business Plan indicator.\nThe network operator should demonstrate the benefits realised through major schemes delivered during the specification period as part of the post opening project evaluation process (POPE). \nThe network operator should also review how it is learning from the findings of the POPEs and disseminating this information.\n&#xa0;\n3. Proposed New A14 scheme – initial public consultation Sep-Oct 2013The Highways Agency is currently consulting on its proposed new A14 ‘improvement’ scheme – see scheme brochure and technical report attached. This scheme is almost identical to that cancelled in October 2010.  Estimated costs have now risen to £1.5 billion \n(one and a half thousand million pounds) \nfor a 25-mil\ne scheme – \nie\n \n£30 million pounds per mile.  Comment: Does the Treasury consider this\n to be \n‘strong value for money’?\n&#xa0;4. Environment  - Output 11 states: The network operator should reduce the negative environmental impacts of \nits\n activities\n.\nComment: This should be a critical component of any transport scheme (rail/road/ coastal/river) \ninitial design and selection process\n not merely an ex-post scheme evaluation (POPE).\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Noise Pollution- Health risksThe network operator \n(HA) \nshould also maintain the practice of taking noise measurements where necessary in the locations of road improvement schemes\n.                Comment: \nNoise pollution is recognised as not merely a nuisance but also as a health hazard – particularly for those suffering from cardiac conditions.\n&#xa0;\nAir Pollution-Health risksThe network operator \n(HA) \nshould work with partner\ns to achieve its commitments on \nair quality, and fulfil its role as statutory \nconsultee\n to the local air quality management process\n.\n              \nComment:  Our greatest concern is for the health of our children.  \n&#xa0;Proposed New A14 scheme – initial public consultation Sep-Oct 2013Environmental Impact\n Assessments were not available \nfor the consultation\n and proposals are still at an early stage though the scheme appears almost identical to that cancelled in 2010.  \nAt a HA presentation on 16 Oct 2013 in Brampton– the village worst affected by the HA proposals – Brampton A14 Campaign Group (BCG) also presented their alternative scheme which had previously been submitted to the HA prior to the 2010 Public Inquiry (BCG scheme outline at \nAnnex A). \nAn illustration of the impact of the 2010 HA scheme at Brampton is at \nAnnex B. At the Pre-Inquiry Meeting in \nMay 2010, the \nInspector asked the HA to develop and assess all alternative proposals submitted (including the BCG scheme) and prepa\nre them for public consultation. \nNothing further was heard from the HA and the\nir \nscheme was cancelled in \nOctober \n2010.  \nBCG also submitted suggestions to the ‘A14 challenge’ in 2011, including a Park &amp; Ride at Brampton Racecourse to reduce car traffic on the A14.  This could be linked with the guided bus route (currently ends at Huntingdon rail station).  A new local shuttle bus service between  the Park &amp; Ride, Brampton village, the rail station and \nHinchingbrooke\n Hospital in Huntingdon was also proposed to relieve peak hour car traffic on local roads. This also seems to have disappeared without trace.\n              \nComment: Under Treasury rules the Highways Agency is supposed to evaluate alternative proposals but has failed to do so.\n&#xa0;\nAir Pollution – Supreme Court Judgement May 2013The previous A14 scheme (2010) was originally conceived in 2001.  There is no evidence that \ncurrent EU and UK transport, environment and health legislation/ policy on air pollution, or UK government commitments to WHO goals relating to the environment and children’s health, have been taken into account in this 2013 version of the scheme. \nThe \nGauderman\n report (\nAnnex C) highlighted the impact of road traffic pollution on children’s lung development and should also have been taken into account.\n              \nSignificantly, environment and health lawyers \nClient Earth\n won a landmark judgement on 1\nst\n May 2013 against the UK government for its failure to protect the public from the harmful effects of air pollution \n(Annex D) which should also be taken into account.\n              \n \nComment:  The UK government is in breach of EU air pollution laws in \n \nrelation to public health.  Health Impact Assessments (HIA) should be introduced urgently to ensure that UK transport policy is compliant with current EU and UK environment and health laws. A HIA should also be conducted at an early stage in the selection and development process of \nproposed \ntransport schemes (all modes) to ensure legal compliance\n and  minimise the risk of nugatory expenditure\n.\n&#xa0;\nEC - Brampton A14 Campaign Group - 17 Oct 2013&#xa0;Annex ABCG ALTERNATIVE  A14 SCHEME - OUTLINEMap - Highways Agency alternative routes during A14 rail viaduct works Brampton Campaign Group (BCG) Alternative A14 SchemeThe \ndetailed \nBCG \nalternative scheme \nwas submitted \nto the Highways Agency (HA) in 2009 prior to the Public Inquiry in 2010.  A broad outline of key points is shown below with current \nupdates in red.&#xa0;There is no \nrational justification for removing the viaduct and reducing trunk road capacity when the A14 problem is identified as \ncongestion.  The rail viaduct can be rebuilt/repaired at much less cost than building a new road - ask the railway industry.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCosts of rebuilding/\nrepairing the \n viaduct would be offset by no need to build a complex local road system in and around Huntingdon. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNew junction on A1198 also not required. \n(submitted to A14 challenge)&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nExtend Guided Bus to Park &amp; Rise site\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProvide a n\new local shuttle bus service from Brampton Park &amp; Ride to Brampton village, Huntingdon Railway Station &amp; \nHinchingbrooke\n Hospital \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis would \nease traffic congestion on local roads and parking problems (and costs) at the station and the hospital\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA421 upgrade now under construction \n(now completed)&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA428 upgrade partially completed (ends at Caxton Gibbet). \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBuild a NEW ROAD from Caxton Gibbet \ndirect \nto the A1 Black Cat roundabout \n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBuild a NEW INTERCHANGE at the Black Cat roundabout with a \ngrade separated \nflyover for the A428/A421 route\n.  \n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRETAIN the existing A428 from Caxton Gibbet to the A1 as a local road.\n&#xa0;                 Existing EU TEN-T freight route Felixstowe – Nuneaton. &#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDfT\n \nand EU transport \npolicy is to encourage switch of freight from road to rail\n \n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe EU also favours technological solutions to congestion problems rather than extending networks.\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe EU Transport Commissioner approved some 20million \neuros\n for work on two key elements of the BCG alternative scheme in 2009\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Annex BHIGHWAYS AGENCY’S  A14 SCHEME (2010)BRAMPTON A1/’NEW A14’ INTERCHANGE &#xa0;Annex C&#xa0;IMPACT ON BRAMPTON10 lanes of traffic plus huge interchange – 114,600 vehicles dailyAreas A &amp; B are minerals extraction sites (sand &amp; gravel quarries)Up to 3 million tonnes of sand &amp; gravel to be extracted during construction of the road and a cement-processing plant builtGauderman report found pronounced deficits in lung function of children living within 500 metres of a motorway Family homes in Brampton are within 300 metres of the roads  &#xa0;&#xa0;                            \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;              \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAnnex D\nMay 3, 2013 \nNews\n&#xa0;\nClientEarth triumph in the Supreme CourtWednesday 1\nst\n May 2013 was a good day for air quality. A legal battle which began in 2011 has resulted in a formal ruling from the highest court in the land that the Government is failing in its legal duty to protect people from the harmful effects of air pollution.\nSome of the complex legal questions will be referred to the European Court of Justice to inform the Supreme Court’s decision on a course of action. This will inevitably cause some delay, but going to the European Court means that any decision will then have implications for all EU Member States. The declaration also means that ‘the way is open to immediate enforcement action at national or European level’. See the \nsummary\n and \nfull judgment\n for more detail.\nIt’s also provided an interesting opportunity to examine \nDefra’s\n tendency to stick their fingers in their ears over this problem. Even on the same day that the Supreme Court made their declaration, a Government source was widely quoted in the media as saying: “Air quality has improved significantly in recent decades and almost all of the UK meets EU air quality limits for all pollutants.” That’s government terminology for “la la \nla\n not listening”, surely?\nAlan Andrews, \nClientEarth\n lawyer, said: “It’s misleading to say that almost all of the UK meets EU air quality limits. Much of the UK land mass has a low population. Air pollution is a problem in cities where most people live. If you’re on holiday in the Highlands you’re at a low risk. If you grow up in an inner city it could do you irreversible and life threatening damage. If we’re going to solve this problem the first thing the Government needs to do is be honest about air pollution’s scale and impact.”\nWe’ll be working through the full implications of this landmark decision by the Supreme Court and particularly how this might help local communities to get traction on the issue in the short term.
