[[[Health and Safety Executive â€“ written evidence]]]&#xa0;The policy objective behind this proposal is to deliver Professor Lofstedt's recommendation by exempting those self-employed who pose no potential risk of harm to others.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;If the proposal is accepted, Section 3(2) of Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 (1974 Act)&#xa0;will&#xa0;read:&#xa0;(2) It shall be the duty of every self-employed person who conducts a relevant undertaking to conduct the undertaking in such a way as to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that he and other persons (not being his employees) who may be affected thereby are not thereby exposed to risks to their health and safety.(2A) For the purposes of subsection (2), an undertaking is a relevant undertaking if -(a) it is of a prescribed description, or(b) persons who may be affected by the way it is conducted, other than the person conducting it (or his employees), could thereby be exposed to risks to their health and safety.&#xa0;The&#xa0;consultation received responses from the following self-employed persons who classed themselves as businesses:&#xa0;FarmerLighting cameramanNurserymanTree SurgeonDirector of an explosive company&#xa0;

[[[words the duty can still apply if not on the prescribed list]]]. For clarity purposes the Government&#xa0;is&#xa0; seeking a delegated power for the Secretary of State to maintain existing safeguards and protections&#xa0;for those self-employed who conduct their work in high hazard or high risk activities eg construction.&#xa0;&#xa0;This will be achieved through Regulations.&#xa0; The Government intend to consult further on the prescribed list but&#xa0;agriculture and explosives are currently proposed&#xa0;and consequently&#xa0;self-employed persons working in those sectors would not be exempt .&#xa0;For those occupations who don't fall into the prescribed list and&#xa0;should&#xa0;not be&#xa0;exempt we will provide guidance. (eg the lighting cameraman's work could affect others by trailing cables creating trip hazards or unsecured lights falling on others).&#xa0;It is recognised that workers in some occupations pose a risk of harm to others only at certain times.&#xa0; On practical grounds&#xa0;it was decided that only those self-employed persons whose work activities would not be expected to put others at risk at any point in the normal course of their work would be exempt, except, if they work in prescribed high hazard&#xa0;or&#xa0;high risk activities where all workers irrespective of their activity will not be exempt.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Sarah WadhamHM Inspector of Health and SafetyOperational Strategy, Enforcement and Accountability UnitHealth and Safety Executive &#xa0;&#xa0;5 November 2013&#xa0;
