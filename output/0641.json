"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research (CLC021)              \nThis submission presents research on three topics \nrelevant to the inquiry, \nnamely\n;\n i) discussion\ns\n with \nmembers of \nthe public about novel and unfamiliar climate change mitigation technologies, ii) \nresearch into \nsocial dilemma theory \nsuggesting that\n particular aspects of knowledge about climate change are key, and iii) the study of local energy developments which br\ning climate change discourse into people\ns\n’\n everyday lives. Our conclusions drawn from these research areas are structured according to the questions specified in the terms of the inquiry rather than by topic.\nAshworth, P., N. Boughen, et al.
