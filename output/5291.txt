[[[Background]]]&#xa0;The Pet Industry Federation is the new name for the Pet Care Trade Association. As a Federation it now combines five specialist trade associations under one umbrella group. Federation members are pet industry specialists and include groomers, pet boarders, pet retailers and manufacturers. We are the only organisation to represent all the different sectors of the pet industry&#xa0;The Pet Industry Federation’s combined membership numbers&#xa0;around 1500 businesses, mostly small, medium-sized enterprises ranging from pet retailers, dog groomers, kennels &amp; catteries, manufacturers, wholesalers and professional services, which included colleges, publishers, dog walkers and pet sitters.&#xa0;The Pet Industry Federation&#xa0;provides a quality assurance of businesses in the pet care sector: all members agree to adhere to our charters, representing best practice for the different sectors of the pet trade on joining the relevant association.

[[[&#xa0;]]]The Pet Industry Federation is dedicated to promoting animal welfare within the pet industry and encouraging responsible pet ownership.  &#xa0;The Pet Industry Federation recognises that primates are intelligent animals that require specialist care in order to be properly cared for in captivity.  They are almost always social creatures (with a few species exceptions) and should not be kept alone.  Their particular husbandry demands and the need for significant amounts of mental and physical stimulation in captivity means the Pet Industry Federation is not in favour of these animals being kept alone under normal circumstances and does not support the keeping of primates in a home environment.&#xa0;The Pet Industry Federation does however support the private ownership of primates housed in appropriate conditions with quality husbandry and behavioural enrichment regimes.   Eg. Where animals are kept in large indoor/outdoor enclosures as mated pairs or groups.&#xa0;

[[[Current Guidelines and L]]]

[[[egislation ]]]&#xa0;The Pet Industry Federation thinks that the DEFRA Primate Code of Practice, the Animal Welfare Act and Dangerous Wild Animal Act combined are more than sufficient to assure the welfare of animals.&#xa0;However it may be worth considering that for such a ‘demanding’ animal type it may be that licencing (outside of DWA)or a system of registering with the Local Authority  may be a potential option.&#xa0;If licensing is an option then consideration must be paid to those carrying out the inspection process and that inspectors must have a thorough knowledge and understanding of the species in question and that local authorities should have sufficient resources for adequate  enforcement, as we understand that  compliance under the DWA  is low 1&#xa0;The Pet Industry Federation believes the Government needs to remain aware of existing legislation and the practicalities of enforcement.  &#xa0;

[[[Implementing a Ban]]]&#xa0;The Animal Welfare Act placed a duty of care on all animal owners.  The Pet Industry Federation believes this is legislative protection for many different types of animal, and that specific exclusions on the ownership of Primates would be disproportionate and unreasonable.&#xa0;There would need to be an extremely strong argument on public safety or welfare grounds for the Pet Industry Federation to take the position of supporting a total ban.&#xa0;

[[[Conclusion]]]&#xa0;In conclusion the Pet Industry Federation understands that Primates require specific care to satisfy their needs in captivity. This however is not inherently different from requirement levels set out for other animals.&#xa0;The Pet Industry Federation  would not support an outright ban on the keeping of Primates in captivity where their welfare needs can be met but would support  restrictions on keeping Primates as pets , where a pet  is defined as an individual animal or animals kept within a  household situation.  &#xa0;On animal welfare grounds, the Pet Ethics Group strongly advises its Pet Industry Federation members against selling any companion or pet primate to members of the general public and largely endorse the RSPCA’s statement on keeping primates as pets.  &#xa0;&#xa0;14 January 2014&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
