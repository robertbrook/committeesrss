defaultAbout the Local Government defaultAssociationdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultLocal Government Association (LGA)
default is the national voice of local government.  We work with councils to support, promote and improve local government.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are a politically-led, cross party organisation which works on behalf of councils to
default ensure local government has a strong, credible voice with national government.  We aim to influence and set the political agenda on the issues that matter to councils so they are able to deliver local solutions to national problems.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe LGA
default covers every 
defaultpart of 
defaultEngland
default and 
defaultWales
default, supporting local government as the most efficient and accountable part of the public sector.
default&#xa0;
defaultSummarydefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultQ: defaultWhat is the rationale for the Government’s proposals to devolve to adefault local level decision-making on transport expenditure? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Government’s approach? Are there better models?default&#xa0;
defaultThe LGA does not accept that there has been a genuine devolution of decision making on transport to a 
defaultlocal level.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe LGA 
defaultwas
default pleased 
defaultto see the Government
default explicitly acknowledging that "local authorities have a crucial role to play in supporting housing and wider economic growth"
default, during 
defaultthe June 
default2013 
defaultSpending Round
default.
default The Government’s 
defaultcomments were 
defaultprompted by
default Lord Heseltine’s report on local growth
default,
default 
defaultwhich
default called for 
defaultWhitehall departments 
defaultto
default devolve more of their funding because local partners know better how to in
defaultvest these funds to best effect
default,
default a position that the LGA has long advocated.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe LGA 
defaulta
defaultccepts
default this has been 
defaultaccompanied by moves to put more levers and funding related to growth into local hands, including 
defaultthe Local Growth Fund, 
defaultthe partial retention of business rates, devolution of the majority of EU structural and investment funds to LEPs 
defaultand the extension of the city deal model to all LEPs as ‘growth deals'.
default There are 
defaultalso 
defaultencouraging signs that the Highways Agency is willing to work with local partners
default,
default although it remains to be seen how this will work in practice as its route based strategies develop. C
defaultouncils and other local partners 
defaultare keen to co-produce plans and shape the 
defaultdecisions
default on the £15 billion spend identified for the Strategic Roads Network
default (SRN)
default,
default which will ha
defaultve major impact
defaults
default on local growth. It is not enough 
defaultfor councils 
defaultto be just consulted on plans after they have been developed.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, we believe that 
defaultsignificant hurdles remain in defaultplace, hindering defaultthe ability of local partners to madefaultximise thdefaulteir drive for economic growth.default 
defaultWhitehall departments 
defaultremain
default resistant to joining up
default their efforts
default and 
defaultreleasing control to a local level
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultR
defaultather than pooling and localising funds through a single pot
default,
default as the 
defaultHeseltine 
defaultReview recommended, a £2 
defaultbillion a year “Local Growth Fund” has been created, drawing primarily on coun
defaultcil
default,
default or already-devolved
default,
default funding.  
defaultThe local growth fund requires councils to engage, through LEPs, in a competitive bidding process with entries being judged by Whitehall. 
defaultThisdefault is not devolution and is a long way from Lord Heseltine’s vision.default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition to this dilution of the fundamental principle
default of devolution, the G
defaultovernment has now indicated that it intends to attach conditions to highways maintenance funding. 
defaultAs this mone
defaulty makes up 
defaulta
default 
defaultgreater
default 
defaultportion of the capital transport funding councils receive from central government than previously
default,
default the effect will be to reduce the ability of councils to decide for themselves how transport funding should be spent.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Government’s 
defaultapproach has caused unnecessary complications
default,
default with funding that was already announced for delivery by Local Transport Boards now to be handed over to LEPs with an allocation process
default 
defaultdifferent from other streams within the fund. This has given rise to seve
defaultral concerns:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultOverall, the Government has taken a distorted approach to funding. Whitehall 
defaultboasts of the £15bn it plans to spend on 
defaultthe 2% of the network controlled by Highways Agency (carrying a third of all traffic) by 2021, while offering £13bn to maintain and improve the other 98% over the same period (which carries two thirds of all traffic).
default&#xa0;
defaultFinally, transport spending is not si
defaultmply about capital projects. The elements that make up an areas transport network do not exis
defaultt in isolation from one another. U
defaultnless councils are in a position to take a holistic view of transport, integrating transport policy into policies on growth, hous
defaulting, health and education, devolved decision making is not possible. For all the Government’s talk of localism, 
defaultmeasures to devolve power to councils in respect of traffic management, bus services and rail franchising have amounted to very little in practidefaultce.default&#xa0;
defaultIt is our view that it is only possible to achieve best value from investment in spending where transport can be seen as a whole and transport policy integrated with other policies. Transport is not an end in itself and its component modes do not exis
defaultt in isolation from one another. At
default the
default local level
default,
default only councils are in a position to deliver this holistic approach and the chief disadvantage of the 
defaultGovernment’s
default approach is that it leads to a piecemeal siloed transport policy that does not deliver bes
defaultt value.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ: defaultDo local bodies (including local authorities, local enterprise partnerships, passenger transport executives, integrated transport authorities and local transport boards) have the capacity to assess, prioritise and deliver local transport defaultschemes? What would the optimum delivery body look like?default&#xa0;
defaultCouncils have shown that they are capable of delivering schemes and working in partnership with
default LEPs, other councils and other stakeholders
default, such as the Highway Agency. 
defaultFor example, 
defaultCornwall 
defaultCounty 
defaultCouncil 
defaulthas demonstrated that it could
default deliver the upgrade to the A30 road for £20 million less than the Highways Agency’s plans, a 25% reduction in costs. Council projects often have a much higher return, with more than a quarter achieving a benefit-to-co
defaultst ratio of 5:1, according to the National Audit Office. By contrast, schemes are considered to have ‘high’ value for money by the Department for Transport if they produce £2 of economic benefit for every £1 spent.
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultGovernment cuts to local budgets of 43
default per cent mean councils have had to make difficult decisions on resourcing delivery, but they are doing so in innovative ways, such as working in partnership and through finding innovative solutions. Further funding cuts would threaten councils’ ability to
default innovate.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe LGA believes there is no optimum body as one size does not fit all. The purpose and value of devolution is that it recognises and enables the right organisations and solutions to come together to tackle the challenges and take opportuniti
defaultes that are unique to that area. Rather than prescribing a particular body
default,
default the LGA 
defaultwould like
default to see devolution that produces place and needs specific
default outcomes,
default enabling councils to take the holistic view of transport outlined above.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Government estim
defaultates that 
defaulttraffic on the local roads network will increase by 4default1.5 per cent between 2010 and 2040default.default defaultThis will put impossible stress on the road network in some areas, hampering growth and creating gridlock. The example of London shows that where local gover
defaultnment has a wide range of tools it can 
defaultdeliver reductions in traffic levels
default (a 7.8 per cent fall in car traffic 2003-10)
default. Yet the government refuses to equip councils outside London with similar powers. Unless this changes some of our towns and cities will
default grind to a halt in the next twenty years.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ: defaultWhat is the best way of dealing with major transport schemes that cross local authority boundaries or have wider regional impact?default&#xa0;
defaultCouncils are already working together on sub-r
defaultegional basis,
default be it through Local Transport Boards, Local Enterprise Partnerships or other local transport bodies.  Councils recognise that major transport schemes often cross boundaries and have shown they can work together on such matters. It should be up to local pa
defaultrtners to decide how best they should organise themselves to deal with major schemes that cross their boundaries.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn many areas councils are coming together to form alliances to find solutions for major transport improvement schemes. Alliances such as the
default A14 Alliance and A47 Alliance demonstrate that councils can work together and pool funding to help lever in investment.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ: defaultHow effectively do local bodies work with each other and with Government departments and national transport agencies?default&#xa0;
defaultCouncils ha
defaultve consistently identified the 
defaultHighways 
defaultA
defaultgency
default 
defaultand National Rail 
defaultas barrier
defaults
default to delivering local growth. The Government has followed up its pledge from its command paper, Action for Roads to reform and modernise the 
defaultHighways Agency
default by launching a consultat
defaultion on the 29th October. The Government has stated that it will “support a much greater local and regional stakeholder involvement in planning for the [strategic roads] network and help to inform our investment decisions for the next spending review”.
default&#xa0;
defaultWit
defaulth councils and LEPs now having a clearer mandate on growth, and
default the
default Highways Agency undergoing reform, this presents an ideal opportunity for a new level of trust, engagement and partnership-working between local government, LEPs and the Highways Agency. 
defaultT
defaulthe forthcoming reforms must result in dialogue between the Highways Agency and local government on the wider issue of economic growth, as opposed to the previously narrow focus on just roads.
default&#xa0;
defaultGrowth is a key local priority and the 
defaultSRN
default 
defaultmakes a vital 
defaultcontribution.
default 
defaultThis is why route based assessments need to be a genuine coproduction between local authorities and the Highways Agency and need to consider all modes of transport and the local road network.  Councils do not just want to be consulted on HA p
defaultlans; councils want co-production of plans.  
default&#xa0;
defaultInvestment in the 
defaultSRN
default 
defaultneeds to be coordinated with the Strategic Economic Plans produced by Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs), as well as existing City Deal agreements. The partnership between 
defaultthe Highways 
defaultAgency
default and councils should not be confined to the SRN alone
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultGiven the difficulties local authorities have experienced with Network Rail
default,
default councils will want to ensure both that lessons are learned and that account is taken of the crucial difference betwee
defaultn rail, where there is a clear ‘end’ to the network, and road where any division between the 
defaultSRN
default and local roads is in fact artificial.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe SRN should not be considered in isolation from the local roads network or from transport provision as a whole. For instance, roads policy should be considered alongside, and integrated with, rail policy. This reflects an underlying principle 
defaultrunning th
defaultrough the LGA’s campaign, 
defaultRewiring Public Services
default which argues for a joined up approach to infrastructure investment.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ: defaultDo the current funding streams for major local transport schemes meet the needs of local authorities? How do current funding streamsdefault compare with previous arrangements?default&#xa0;
defaultCurrent funding arrangements will deliver more money for some councils
default,
default who will also benefit from the fact that the 
defaultLocal Growth Fund (
defaultLGF
default)
default provides a more flexible approach to funding major schemes than was the case 
defaultpreviously.  However there has been insufficient devolution of funding and the increased capital budget does not make sufficient provision for highways maintenance.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe DfT originally proposed reforming the local majors funding by dividing the fund betwee
defaultn Local Transport Boards (LTBs). The LGA had argue 
defaultfor
default the funding to be devolved to councils who would then make their own partnerships for cross-boundary schemes. The shift from the DfT’s original proposals to LGF was a retrograde step in the sense that 
defaultit was a return to the idea of centrally judged bidding process.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultLGA has been
default successful in 
defaultputting its
default case to
default the Department for Transport (DfT) to provide more resources for
default 
defaulttransport to councils. The 2015/16 Spending Round,
default 
defaultannounced on the 26 
defaultJune, more than doubled local majors transport scheme funding
default 
defaultfrom £375 million per annum to £819 million per annum.
default However, as this money has been subsumed into the LGF, this increase will only benefit those councils that are successful in bidding for LG
defaultF funds
default,
default and we have outlined above a number of concerns over how the LGF works. 
defaultNotwithstanding
default the
defaultse concerns, for those councils whose LGF bids are successful, the exercise offer
defaults
default a potentially significant opportunity to invest in local transport, but t
defaulthis success will be bought in part at the expense of those whose bids are not successful, and the wider success is spread (
defaulti.e.
default the greater the number of centrally approved bids), the less it is worth.
default Even for those councils who are successful, the cost o
defaultf bidding is substantial, particularly when local government is suffering 43% cuts (across the lifetime of the current Parliament).
default&#xa0;
defaultThe difficult position councils face
default,
default especially those not favoured by the judges of LGF bids, is compounded by persistent 
defaultshortcomings in the roads maintenance funding. 
defaultThe 
defaultincrease in highways maintenance funding in 
defaultthe 
default2010
default Spending
default 
defaultReview 
defaulthas, in effect, been achieved by cuts in the Integrated Transport Block (ITB)
default.
default For councils that receive no funding from the Local Growth Fund
default,
default the 
defaultcombined annual ITB and highways maintenance funding will be the same between the period 2015-21 as in 2014-5. 
defaultMoreover, as the 2013 ALARM survey
default estimated that current levels of govern
defaultment funding for roads maintenance in England fell short by £829m a year, it is obvious that the ‘increase’ will leave a considerable shortfall going forward and that further deterioration in the network will take place assuming recent levels of severe wea
defaultther damage continue. It would take ten years to repair the pothole backlog at current funding 
defaultlevels assuming no new ‘wear and tear’ was inflicted on our roads. However, the prospect of a 40 per cent increase in traffic as highlighted earlier suggests mai
defaultntenance pressures will increase in coming years. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMoreover, whilst capital funding has increased
default,
default councils are experiencing a rapid squeeze on vital revenue funding which is needed to develop and deliver quality 
defaultschemes. 
defaultThe 43default% reduction in core councildefault funding over the spending review period to 2015/16 will considerably restrict councils ability, not their willingness, to maximise the potential for their areas.default defaultWhere limited resources could be put to better use to develop high quality, value-for-money s
defaultchemes, councils 
defaulthave
default to devote time to reviewing governance arrangement from Local Transport Boards to LEPs, and competitive bidding for funds.
default&#xa0;
defaultFunding from a national perspective appears distorted.
default The G
defaultovernment boasts of the £15bn it plans to spend on
default the 2% of the network controlled by H
defaultighways 
defaultA
defaultgency
default (carrying a third of all traffic) by 2021, while offering £13bn to maintain and improve the other 98% over the same period (
defaultwhich carries
default two thirds of all traffic).
default&#xa0;
defaultQ: defaultWhat impact will the devolution defaultin 2015 of funding to Local Transport Bodies and the introduction of the Single Local Growth Fund have?default&#xa0;
defaultCouncils are working out arrangements for governance and decision-making during the transition. They will find the most efficient and practical ways of
default dealing with the unnecessary complications that 
defaultthe 
defaultGovernment has created which have been highlighted in the response above.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ: defaultHow can local authorities attract greater investment from the private sector for the delivery and maintenance of local transpdefaultort infrastructure? What scope is there for the use of alternative funding streams?default&#xa0;
defaultLocal government is one of the 
defaultfew 
defaultparts of the public sector that uses its resources to increase growth and productivity, both of which are critical to funding services. 
defaultCouncils need financial autonomy to maximise their assets and invest to support growth
default and infrastructure
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe LGA’s Rewiring Public Service
defaults
default campaign advocates devolving certain tax and spending decisions to the local level, so that public services can be integrated to deliver better results. 
defaultThis would benefit the economy by moving away from top-down solutions that don’t fit everywhere, inste
defaultad allowing individual areas to play to its strengths. This would result in a more resilient economy overall by making each area stronger instead of accepting that some will always be dependent on others. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSuch a system would incentivise local growth 
defaultand 
defaultinvestment, which 
defaultjoin
defaulting
default up whole place decision-making to deliver more effective, better value services.
default&#xa0;
default It could bring together decision making on health, 
defaulttransport, 
defaulthousing, education and emergency services and include closer working with business and
default the voluntary sector.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultDevolving in this way would mean breaking away from our busted system of local government finance and allowing local areas to raise funds in ways that make sense in that area, not relying on Council Tax and Business rates. 
default&#xa0;
defaultLocal p
defaulteople would get the results and local services they care about by giving them power over local taxation and how their taxes are spent.
default&#xa0;
defaultDespite the 43% funding cuts (across the life of the current Parliament) which councils are being forced to endure, local government is still 
defaultdelivering and innovating on major in
defaultfrastructure projects that will 
defaultradically transform the economic viability of
default an area. Major projects such as the Mersey
default 
defaultGateway, will drastically reduce congestion and kick-start a major 20 year regeneration
default 
defaultprogramme. The new bridge is being procured as a Public Private Partnership with over
default 
default70 per cent 
defaultof the cost being funded b
defaulty the private sector (financed through tolls
default 
defaultcollected).
default&#xa0;
defaultWolverhampton and Staffordshire councils jointly funded the development of critical road
default 
defaultinfrastructure, which involved £36 million of prudential borrowing, which helped give Tata Ltd
default 
defaultcertainty and 
defaultconfidence in making the investment decision for a £400million investment in a
default 
defaultnew manufacturing plant for Jaguar Land Rover.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe LGA is in discussion with HM Treasury on the r
defaulte-creat
defaultion of a
default thriving market in municipal bonds
default 
defaultwhich England once had and m
defaultost other countries
default still have. Such as bond market would 
defaultfree local government borrowing from Treasury
default 
defaultrestrictions because it already complies with
default 
defaultappropriate prudential rules
default; and 
defaultallow access to alternative sources of finance
default, 
defaultincluding the creation o
defaultf a local government bond
default 
defaultagency and the right to develop earn-back deals.
default This
default would allow places to reinvest the proceeds
default 
defaultof additional growth in local services and measures
default 
defaultto promote further growth
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ: defaultHow clear are the lines of accountability for defaultlocal decision making on transport expenditure?default&#xa0;
defaultAs always, councils have shown that they can work pragmatically to ensure clear lines of accountability on their spending decisions. As mentioned 
defaultpreviously
default, the Government has complicated matters by introdu
defaultcing Local Transport Boards
default,
default then then transferring future transport spending decisions to Local Enterprise Partnerships. 
defaultAs LEPs develop in this way, the issue of accountability needs to be considered. 
defaultCouncils are working with LEP
default partner
default to identify way
defaults to ensure that there is still democratic accountability within the new system.  
default&#xa0;
defaultWhilst councils welcome the move towards greater devolution of decision-making to the local level, they remain frustrated by the fact that the permanent secretary of the D
defaulte
defaultpartment for 
defaultT
defaultransport 
defaultremains
default accountable to P
defaultarliament
default for local transport investment. Given the spending is to benefit local residents and businesses, the LGA firmly believes that it should be at the local level where the public can 
defaulthold decision-makers to account.
