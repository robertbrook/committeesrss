defaultSummarydefault&#xa0;
defaultPAPYRUS has campaigned since 
default2004 for better regulation of 
defaultthe online promotion of suicide.
default&#xa0;
defaultAmongst the many dangers posed by the internet
default,
default its use to promote suicide receives relatively little attention.  
default&#xa0;
defaultYoung people, for whom the internet is a primary source of information
default, are particularly vulnerable to web
defaultsites and 
defaultchatrooms
default promoting suicide.
default 
defaultFor thos
defaulte young people who are
default suicidal or are vulnerable because of a mental health concern, such platforms can pose a particular danger.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Government has made clear that the law 
defaultwhich 
defaultprevent
defaults
default encouraging or assi
defaultsting suicide applies online as much as offline, but no prosecution for online assistance has been made in this country.
default&#xa0;
defaultISPs should block websites and 
defaultchatrooms
default which deliberately promote suicide. In the absence of this 
defaultparents should have to “
defaultopt in
default” to
default suicide sites in the same way as is proposed for other sites posing 
defaulta
default danger to children and young people.
default&#xa0;
defaultBodies such as IWF and CEOP should include suicide within their remit – at present both exclude it.
default&#xa0;
defaultDetaildefault&#xa0;
default1. PAPYRUS Prevention of Young Suicide 
defaultis a national charity dedicated to the prevention of young suicide. Originally started by parents who had all lost a son or daughter to suicide it is now open to all who share our aims, although many of its members have personal experience of a young perso
defaultn’s suicide. 
default&#xa0;
default2. Suicide is one of the biggest causes of death amongst young people; 
defaultevery year in the UK between 600 and 800 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 take their own lives - a number equivalent to the population of a small secondary scho
defaultol; under the age of 35, the number rises 
defaultfurther. According to the ONS statistics published on suicides in 2011
default, the total number of those who took their own lives before they reached 35 years of age was over 1700
default.
default&#xa0;
default3. 
defaultIn the early years of the century, 
defaultPAPYRUS became aware of several young people who had killed themselves after downloading information
default from web
defaults
defaulti
defaulttes
default giving specific information and advice on how to take one’s own life and/or having participated in 
defaultchatrooms
default where advice and 
defaultencouragement w
defaultas given on killing one
defaultself. Since 2004 it has campaigned for the removal
default,
default or at least some regulation
default,
default of such sites.
default 
default&#xa0;
default4. 
defaultMuch of the p
defaultublic concern about the 
defaultdangers of 
defaultthe internet 
defaulthas centred on
default its use 
defaultto promote pornography, bullying
default, eating 
defaultdisorders
default and self
default 
defaultharm
default; these are important areas of concern both in their own right and because they
default may play a
default significant 
defaultpart in 
defaultleading 
defaultvulnerable people 
defaultto 
defaultconsider and attemp
defaultt suicide.
default But the suicide sites themselves are uniquely dangerous in that
default they can - and do - lead directly to deaths of vulnerable young people.
default They also provide information which is not available from other sources. You will not find a book in W H Smith’s describing in graphic and lurid detail the various ways of killing you
defaultrself; you 
defaultcan
default find this (sometimes with pictures) on the internet.  And of course this can be accessed 
defaultby children and vulnerable young people

default&#xa0;
default5. For many young people the internet has become the primary source of information
default; coupled with the pressures of 
defaultgrowing up, sometimes exacerbated by
default mental ill-health, there 
defaultis 
defaulta particular confluence of danger.
default And although PAPYRUS’s particular concern is for young people many others who are vulnerable, again through mental illness or for other reasons, are also all too easily exposed to the dangers of the sites.
default When PAPYRUS
default began campaigning it knew of four young people who had killed themselves with the
default aid of the internet. Some time
default ago the number of internet-related suicides of which we were aware passed 50 and we are sure that this is a considerable underestimate
default—
default no fi
defaultgures are collected centrally and this figure was obtained merely through 
defaultunofficial 
defaultpress monitoring. Man
defaulty
default coroners have expressed concern about the impact of the internet in cases of suicide.
default&#xa0;
default6. The 
default196
default1
default Suicide
default Act made it illegal to ai
defaultd, abet, counsel
default or procure a suicide. The Coroners and Justice Act 2009 amended the law by updating the language to refer simply to assisting and encouraging suicide
default,
default whilst making it clear that the l
defaultaw applies to online action
defaults in exactly t
defaulth
defaulte
default same way as it does offline
default.
default 
defaultPAPYRUS contends that sites and 
defaultchatrooms
default promoting suicide may be illegal in that they can
default—
defaultand do
default—
defaultassist and encourage others to take their own lives
default; h
defaultowever no prosecution has taken place in this country. 
default 
defaultWe believe that the Internet Service Pr
defaultoviders (ISPs) should take action to block such sites in the same way as they do for other illegal sites, such as child pornography.
default&#xa0;
default7. In his speech on 22
defaultnd
default July the Prime Minister called on the ISPs to provide 
defaultto all new customers f
defaultamily friendly filter
defaults 
defaultcovering all devices in a household, which can only be switched off by the householder; and to extend this in due course to all existing customers
default—
defaultin effect an “opt-in” approach despite the fact that this has previously been eschewed by the Government.
default PAPYRUS warmly welcomes the Prime Minister’s intervention and believes that the filters must automatically block dangerous sites and 
defaultchatrooms
default which promote suicide. (
defaultTalkTalk
default 
defaulthas 
defaulttold us that the category most blocked by parents using their 
defaultexisting filt
defaulters is suicide/
defaultself harm.)  We have written to the Prime Minister seeking his assurance that the suicide sites will be encompassed within these new arrangements.
default We trust that this will have the support of your committee also.
default&#xa0;
default8. The internet can, of cour
defaultse, also be beneficial in countering suicide and in providing support to those who are suicidal; PAPYRUS’s own helpline
default provides 
defaultprofess
defaulti
defaulto
defaultnal advice and information 
defaultby 
defaulttele
defaultphone
default, email 
defaultor text messaging, to those concerned that a young person may be at ri
defaultsk of suicide
default and to young people
default who 
defaultare 
defaultthemselves having thoughts of suicide.
default It has sometimes been argued than any blocking of harmful suicide sites must of necessity also block helpful sites; we have always believed that it is perfectly possible to re
defaulttain access to the helpful sites and were pleased to note that the Prime Minister acknowledged this in his speech and has asked UKCCISS to lead work to ensure that this is so. We stand ready to assist in this work.
default&#xa0;
default9. 
defaultAlthough these recent advances have f
defaultocussed on protecting children and the young (and we warmly welcome them as such) we believe that the dubious legality of the websites and 
defaultchatrooms
default provides sufficient grounds for ISPs to block them for all users. There is als
defaulto a moral justification for d
defaultoing so
default; anyone seeking access to them is likely to be vulnerable, either generically or at that particular time. 
default&#xa0;
default10. 
defaultOne of the proven ways of reducing suicides is to limit access to the means of killing oneself
default.
default 
defaultThis is highlighted in the current 
defaultNational Suicide Prevention Strategy in Area for Action 3
default and a
default recent study has confirmed
default 
defaultthe effective
defaultness of

defaultThe National Suicide Prevention Strategy for England states

defaultthat “Th

default” 
default T

defaultfrom easy access 
defaultboth to information on the
default means 
defaultof killing themselves and indeed to the means themse
defaultlves, through suicide paraphernalia and kits

default.
default&#xa0;
default11. One of the difficulties in pursuing the dangers of suicide promotion online is that there is no central body to which 
defaultrelevant 
defaultconcerns can be expressed. 
defaultNeither the industry body
default—
defaultthe Internet Watch Foundation (IWF)
default—
defaultnor the Government’s Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) regards suicide as falling within their remit. We have asked repeatedly for this to change and believe that real b
defaultenefits would ensue if this were to happen.
