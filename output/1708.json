"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Dr Susan Alison Murray BSc PhD FRCPath (WSC058)&#xa0;\nSummary\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDeclaration of interests\n&#xa0;\nI am a Consultant Clinical Scientist in Microbiology at North Bristol\n NHS Trust.\n&#xa0;\nMy career path is: BSC in Microbiology from University of Bristol 1977, PhD in Medical Microbiology University of London 1981, Membership of the Royal College of Pathologists (by examination) in 1987, Fellowship of the Royal College of Pathologists in 199\n7.\n&#xa0;\nMy role as a Consultant Clinical Scientist is very similar to that of my medically trained colleagues in providing\n clinical advic\ne on the diagnosis, treatment and management of patients in Primary and Secondary\n care and \nliaison bet\nween the Microbiology \nlaboratory and clinicians.  There was no training programme at the time of my training so I have\n recently \nbeen closely involved with the Royal College of Pathologists and with colleagues have developed a Higher Specialist Training curriculum and programme \nto enable more scientists to achieve this especially as medically trained microbiologists training and roles become more clinically ‘hands-on’.\n&#xa0;\nI believe that the Clinical Scientist role is an excellent career path for women in Microbiology and it is very \nimportant that training posts \nare financially supported by the Department of Health.\n&#xa0;\nI think the skills a\ncquired by wo\nmen in this training such as high level expert knowledge of clinical microbiology, clinical liaison with all grades of staff and also incl\nuding patients and carers, and health service management would transfer very well to other employment sectors so retention of highly trained and skilled women in academic or health service careers is paramount. To do this I believe more support is needed a\nt all levels by employers and at Government level to provide continuing management training and allowing continuing career-long knowledge and skills acquisition in non training senior and Consultant level roles\n \nto ensure \nwomen\n can compete with men for the \nhighest level roles. \n&#xa0;\nIt may be there is currently a lack of knowledge in Science graduates and PhD students of the reality of a career in the health service and it would be helpful for Government to encourage and provide support for links with \nthe Health\n Service and \nUniversities to  \nprovide internships or run-through training to encourage retention of women graduates or PhD students in STEM careers.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
