defaultc
defaultontinue to be in

defaultc
defaulte of those responsible for the day-to-day

defaultrunning of the BBC whether

default&#xa0;
defaultTo begin with the concept of a broadcaster entirely supported by 
defaultc
defaultompulsory
default 
defaultcontributions from the licence fee is truly an anachronism. I'm just amazed that none
default 
defaultof the commercial broadcasters have brought a charge of discrimination against the
default 
defaultBBC, and/or the Government of the day, given that they are forced to compete in the
default 
defaultcommercial marketplace but their major competitor, the BBC, is spoon-fed from the
default 
defaultlicence fee and doesn't have to compete at all.
default&#xa0;
defaultBut if the 
defaultBeeb
default continues to justify its existen
defaultc
defaulte based on its broadcasting history,
default 
defaultthen how come it manages to avoid the founding principles still writ large in the lobby
default 
defaultof Broad
defaultc
defaultasting House: 
defaultThis Temple of
default 
defaultthe Arts and Muses is dedicated to Almighty
default 
defaultGod
default. It
default 
defaultis

defaultprayer that good seed sown may bring

defaulto
defaultrth a good
default 
defaultharvest, that all things hostile to peace or purity may be banished
default f
defaultrom this house.
default 
defaultThe sound you hear is Lord Reith turning in his grave.
default&#xa0;
defaultAlmost without exception the BBC's broadcasting values expressed in that statement
default 
defaulthave long-since been abandoned and before I get into the substan
defaultc
defaulte of
default 
defaultmy letter I
default 
defaultwould cite an example from a new
defaultsca
defaultst yesterday that proves my point. The news
default 
defaultreader, interviewing an invited guest, began his question with: "How 
defaultthe hell 
defaultdo we as
default 
defaulta nation... "There is absolutely no need for such coarsen
defaulte
defaultss - no excuse for language
default 
defaultof that sort (again it keeps Lord Reith gyrating - though my concern, as a priest, is for
default 
defaultthe offence offered to another, higher, Lord).
default&#xa0;
defaultI find myself constantly complaining to the BBC about the "strong language", 
defaultie
default.
default 
defaultobscenities, included in its (admittedly post 9pm) programming, complaints they
default 
defaulttotally ignore 
default- 
defaultjust as for decades they ignored the late Mary Whitehouse and her
default 
defaultvaliant but largely fruitless efforts to get them to clean up their act. If the BBC
default 
defaultbothers to respond to 
defaultc
defaultomplaints at all, it is the usual waste-of-space justification (as
default 
defaultthey see it) that what individuals find offensive varies widely. That may be true, but
default 
defaultthe very fact that they warn people in advance of
default 
default"strong language" content is an
defaultadmission
default that they know it is offensive. There is absolutely no justification for
default 
defaultbroadcasting deliberately offensive material into people's homes. We do not pay a
default 
defaultlicence fee to find we have to switch our televisions of
defaultf
default. 
default“T
defaulthat's how live is
default”
default they
default 
defaultwill say, well maybe, but if
default I
default wanted to see how life is I can sit on my doorstep for
default 
defaultfr
defaultee.
default&#xa0;
defaultBut given the arrogance that characterises the 
defaultBeeb's
default typical response to complaints
default 
defaultreceived
default, 
default 
defaultit clearly has no intention whatsoever of not broadcasting obscene
default 
defaultlanguage, it and all other broadcasters should be made to at least include a printed
default 
defaultwarning next to a programme in the various TV magazines and programme listings
default 
default(as they do for the sex/violence/language content of films) so people know what to
default 
defaultexpect rather than wasting an entire evening waiting to watch a programme that looks
default 
defaultinteresting only to be informed of the language content immediately before it is due to
default 
defaultbegin and having, if they so choose, to switch off or switch channels. I have appealed
default 
defaultover and over for such a consid
defaulte
defaultration, but they don't have any consideration 
default–
default they
default 
defaultdon't have to - they get paid for what they do regardless - they don't have to justify
default 
defaulttheir existence or the standard of the work they carry out for the money we pay them
default 
defaultand that's the basic problem.
default&#xa0;
defaultThey are also reluctant to warn people in advance, I feel, because they are afraid of
default 
defaultlosing viewers. If someone has sat there all evening only to be told at the last moment
default 
defaultabout programme 
defaultcontent, it is the 
defaultBeeb's
default hope they will cut their losses and stick
default 
defaultwith it -I won't
default 
default- ever. But isn't that totally dishonest? - trying to trick people into
default 
defaultwatching their programmes?
default&#xa0;
defaultThe various scandals that have surfaced within the BBC recently, not to mention the
default 
defaultscandal also of the obscene salaries being paid to executives and so-called "talent"
default 
default(star presenters) is a reflection of the arrogance that seems to be rife within the
default 
defaultCorporation. They sit there in their ivory tow
defaulte
defaultrs safe in the knowledge that they don't
default 
defaulthave to justify their "cloud cuckoo land" existence, a luxury no other company or
default 
defaultbusiness could hope to enjoy. The 
defaultBeeb
default displays a breath-taking arrogance verging
default 
defaulton ignorance, and a total disregard for the public who is paying the bills, in every
default 
defaultaspect of its operation. I suspect that if some of its executives had to compete in the
default 
defaultreal world they would quickly find themselves at the nearest Job Centre where some
default 
defaultof them rightly belong.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat the BBC should b
defaulte
default made to do in this day and age is either operate on a
default 
defaultcommercial basis like its competitors, or follow the example of PBS in the States and
default 
defaulthave annual fund-raising drives based on a display of the programming it hopes to
default 
defaultproduce. If people like what they see they pledge a voluntary donation to help pay 
defaultfor
default 
defaultit, and if they don't then the 
defaultBeeb
default would have to cut its cloth accordingly - at least it
default 
defaultwould have to justify its existence. On that basis alone, if it were in my power, I
default 
defaultwould close it down tomorrow until it did.
default&#xa0;
defaultFinally, in the response I received to my most recent complaint about "strong
default 
defaultlanguage" it was clear that the 
defaultBeeb
default keeps a list of people like me who they hear from
default 
defaultrepeatedly. Don't you think that's a bit 1984ish? My name is on a list. I don't
default 
defaultconsider myself to be a chronic BBC complainant so much as a principled viewer
default 
default- 
defaultlike
default 
defaultMary Whitehouse was - and of course the 
defaultBeeb
default considered (and treated) her as a
default 
defaultcrank too. W
defaulte
default cranks must stick together if we are to have any hope of affecting
default 
defaultchange for the better - that and my hope that your Committee can bring some long
default 
defaultoverdue
default 
defaultinfluence to bear in that regard.
