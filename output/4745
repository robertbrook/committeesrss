[normal]Written evidence submitted by Rev Neil [bold]McNicholas[bold] [FBB0101][bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I 
[normal]c
[normal]ontinue to be in
[normal]c
[normal]ensed by the arrogan
[normal]c
[normal]e of those responsible for the day-to-day
[normal] 
[normal]running of the BBC whether 
[normal]its
[normal] Dire
[normal]c
[normal]tor or (and here's a misnomer if ever there was
[normal] 
[normal]one) the BBC Trust!
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To begin with the concept of a broadcaster entirely supported by 
[normal]c
[normal]ompulsory
[normal] 
[normal]contributions from the licence fee is truly an anachronism. I'm just amazed that none
[normal] 
[normal]of the commercial broadcasters have brought a charge of discrimination against the
[normal] 
[normal]BBC, and/or the Government of the day, given that they are forced to compete in the
[normal] 
[normal]commercial marketplace but their major competitor, the BBC, is spoon-fed from the
[normal] 
[normal]licence fee and doesn't have to compete at all.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]But if the 
[normal]Beeb
[normal] continues to justify its existen
[normal]c
[normal]e based on its broadcasting history,
[normal] 
[normal]then how come it manages to avoid the founding principles still writ large in the lobby
[normal] 
[normal]of Broad
[normal]c
[normal]asting House: 
[normal]This Temple of
[normal] 
[normal]the Arts and Muses is dedicated to Almighty
[normal] 
[normal]God
[normal]. It
[normal] 
[normal]is 
[normal](the governors') 
[normal]prayer that good seed sown may bring
[normal] 
[normal]f
[normal]o
[normal]rth a good
[normal] 
[normal]harvest, that all things hostile to peace or purity may be banished
[normal] f
[normal]rom this house.
[normal] 
[normal]The sound you hear is Lord Reith turning in his grave.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Almost without exception the BBC's broadcasting values expressed in that statement
[normal] 
[normal]have long-since been abandoned and before I get into the substan
[normal]c
[normal]e of
[normal] 
[normal]my letter I
[normal] 
[normal]would cite an example from a new
[normal]sca
[normal]st yesterday that proves my point. The news
[normal] 
[normal]reader, interviewing an invited guest, began his question with: "How 
[normal]the hell 
[normal]do we as
[normal] 
[normal]a nation... "There is absolutely no need for such coarsen
[normal]e
[normal]ss - no excuse for language
[normal] 
[normal]of that sort (again it keeps Lord Reith gyrating - though my concern, as a priest, is for
[normal] 
[normal]the offence offered to another, higher, Lord).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I find myself constantly complaining to the BBC about the "strong language", 
[normal]ie
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]obscenities, included in its (admittedly post 9pm) programming, complaints they
[normal] 
[normal]totally ignore 
[normal]- 
[normal]just as for decades they ignored the late Mary Whitehouse and her
[normal] 
[normal]valiant but largely fruitless efforts to get them to clean up their act. If the BBC
[normal] 
[normal]bothers to respond to 
[normal]c
[normal]omplaints at all, it is the usual waste-of-space justification (as
[normal] 
[normal]they see it) that what individuals find offensive varies widely. That may be true, but
[normal] 
[normal]the very fact that they warn people in advance of
[normal] 
[normal]"strong language" content is an
[normal]admission
[normal] that they know it is offensive. There is absolutely no justification for
[normal] 
[normal]broadcasting deliberately offensive material into people's homes. We do not pay a
[normal] 
[normal]licence fee to find we have to switch our televisions of
[normal]f
[normal]. 
[normal]“T
[normal]hat's how live is
[normal]”
[normal] they
[normal] 
[normal]will say, well maybe, but if
[normal] I
[normal] wanted to see how life is I can sit on my doorstep for
[normal] 
[normal]fr
[normal]ee.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]But given the arrogance that characterises the 
[normal]Beeb's
[normal] typical response to complaints
[normal] 
[normal]received
[normal], 
[normal] 
[normal]it clearly has no intention whatsoever of not broadcasting obscene
[normal] 
[normal]language, it and all other broadcasters should be made to at least include a printed
[normal] 
[normal]warning next to a programme in the various TV magazines and programme listings
[normal] 
[normal](as they do for the sex/violence/language content of films) so people know what to
[normal] 
[normal]expect rather than wasting an entire evening waiting to watch a programme that looks
[normal] 
[normal]interesting only to be informed of the language content immediately before it is due to
[normal] 
[normal]begin and having, if they so choose, to switch off or switch channels. I have appealed
[normal] 
[normal]over and over for such a consid
[normal]e
[normal]ration, but they don't have any consideration 
[normal]–
[normal] they
[normal] 
[normal]don't have to - they get paid for what they do regardless - they don't have to justify
[normal] 
[normal]their existence or the standard of the work they carry out for the money we pay them
[normal] 
[normal]and that's the basic problem.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]They are also reluctant to warn people in advance, I feel, because they are afraid of
[normal] 
[normal]losing viewers. If someone has sat there all evening only to be told at the last moment
[normal] 
[normal]about programme 
[normal]content, it is the 
[normal]Beeb's
[normal] hope they will cut their losses and stick
[normal] 
[normal]with it -I won't
[normal] 
[normal]- ever. But isn't that totally dishonest? - trying to trick people into
[normal] 
[normal]watching their programmes?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The various scandals that have surfaced within the BBC recently, not to mention the
[normal] 
[normal]scandal also of the obscene salaries being paid to executives and so-called "talent"
[normal] 
[normal](star presenters) is a reflection of the arrogance that seems to be rife within the
[normal] 
[normal]Corporation. They sit there in their ivory tow
[normal]e
[normal]rs safe in the knowledge that they don't
[normal] 
[normal]have to justify their "cloud cuckoo land" existence, a luxury no other company or
[normal] 
[normal]business could hope to enjoy. The 
[normal]Beeb
[normal] displays a breath-taking arrogance verging
[normal] 
[normal]on ignorance, and a total disregard for the public who is paying the bills, in every
[normal] 
[normal]aspect of its operation. I suspect that if some of its executives had to compete in the
[normal] 
[normal]real world they would quickly find themselves at the nearest Job Centre where some
[normal] 
[normal]of them rightly belong.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What the BBC should b
[normal]e
[normal] made to do in this day and age is either operate on a
[normal] 
[normal]commercial basis like its competitors, or follow the example of PBS in the States and
[normal] 
[normal]have annual fund-raising drives based on a display of the programming it hopes to
[normal] 
[normal]produce. If people like what they see they pledge a voluntary donation to help pay 
[normal]for
[normal] 
[normal]it, and if they don't then the 
[normal]Beeb
[normal] would have to cut its cloth accordingly - at least it
[normal] 
[normal]would have to justify its existence. On that basis alone, if it were in my power, I
[normal] 
[normal]would close it down tomorrow until it did.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Finally, in the response I received to my most recent complaint about "strong
[normal] 
[normal]language" it was clear that the 
[normal]Beeb
[normal] keeps a list of people like me who they hear from
[normal] 
[normal]repeatedly. Don't you think that's a bit 1984ish? My name is on a list. I don't
[normal] 
[normal]consider myself to be a chronic BBC complainant so much as a principled viewer
[normal] 
[normal]- 
[normal]like
[normal] 
[normal]Mary Whitehouse was - and of course the 
[normal]Beeb
[normal] considered (and treated) her as a
[normal] 
[normal]crank too. W
[normal]e
[normal] cranks must stick together if we are to have any hope of affecting
[normal] 
[normal]change for the better - that and my hope that your Committee can bring some long
[normal] 
[normal]overdue
[normal] 
[normal]influence to bear in that regard.
