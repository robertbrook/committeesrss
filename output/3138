[normal]EIS 39[bold]Written evidence submitted by the [bold]Mineral Products Association (MPA)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Mineral Products Association (MPA) is the trade association for the aggregates, asphalt, cement, concrete, dimension stone, lime, mortar and silica sand industries. 
[normal]With the recent addition of The British Precast Concrete Federation (BPCF) and the British Association of Reinforcement (BAR), it has a growing membership of 465 companies and is the sectoral voice for mineral products. MPA membership is made up of the vas
[normal]t majority of independent SME companies throughout the UK, as well as the 9 major international and global companies. It covers 100% of GB cement production, 90% of aggregates production, 95% of asphalt and ready-mixed concrete production and 70% of precas
[normal]t concrete production. Each year the industry supplies £9 billion of materials and services to the £120 billion construction and other sectors. Industry production represents the largest materials flow in the UK economy and is also one of the largest manuf
[normal]acturing sectors.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The following answers are valid for the UK industries represented by MPA members, where possible and appropriate:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.  What is the contribution to the UK economy of extractive industries in the UK?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The usual means of assessing the econo
[normal]mic contribution of industries or sectors is through Gross Value Added (GVA). The main problem with such analyses set out in official statistics is that they tend to understate the overall contribution of extractive industries due to the scope of the stand
[normal]ard industrial classifications used. For extractive industries this means that sectoral GVA will typically not cover value added or downstream activities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In 2012 MPA commissioned Capital Economics
[normal] 
[normal]to evaluate the economic contribution of the industries 
[normal]and companies represented by MPA. This scope covered mineral extraction and processing but also the manufacture of mineral products such as cement, concrete and asphalt and associated activities such as industry transport. Outcomes of the research included
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.  How do the UK-based extractive industries support employment a) in the UK and b) for UK citizens overseas?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There are two distinct elements to this question: direct 
[normal]employment and indirect employment.  The Capital Economics research defined direct employment as those engaged in extraction, the production of mineral products and associated activities and estimated direct employment in 2011 at between 33,000 and 39,000.
[normal] The research also estimated that 37,200 jobs in the industry supply chain were supported by the mineral products industry within the scope of MPA membership. The direct employment of the industry is distributed throughout the UK and is predominantly rural
[normal] based. There are particular concentrations of direct employment in The East Midlands, South West and Yorkshire and Humberside regions of England and in Scotland. Supply chain or indirect employment is also distributed nationally, with significant employme
[normal]nt in the North West, East and West Midlands and South East of England.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](b) There is no
[normal] direct knowledge
[normal] of the UK indigenous extractive minerals industries
[normal]’ support for UK citizens overseas
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.  Does UK industry benefit more widely from the UK’s [bold]position as a centre for extractive industries e.g. in sales of machinery and services to international businesses in the sector?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Being modern industries the UK extractive minerals industries are customers for a huge number of manufactured products, rangi
[normal]ng from ICT equipment at one end of the scale, to heavy mobile or static plant at the other end
[normal] (Including marine aggregate dredgers at £35 million)
[normal].  Some of this will be indigenously produced – a classic example might be JCB equipment and plant – but muc
[normal]h will not, albeit some plant and equipment will be franchised to UK manufacturers that are owned overseas
[normal], and
[normal] much of the repair and maintenance work will be carried out by UK operators
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Traditionally, the UK has been a manufacturer of such plant and eq
[normal]uipment, possibly stemming from the fact that much of the high end technical training and education has been done at the Royal School of Mines or its Cornish counterpart, the Camborne School of Mines, and other British Universities, generating a long stand
[normal]ing relationship with things British!  In the global current market, however, it is doubted whether the UK supporting industries benefit from either traditional empathy or training experience, other than in consultancy work such as law, design, environment
[normal]al management, health and safety or general management.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.  Has the boom in London-listed extractive companies with businesses overseas over the last two decades resulted in a strengthening in the UK’s competitive position in this sector?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]This is not s
[normal]omething on which MPA can comment directly, as its responsibilities lie solely with UK operations, albeit with an additional interest in European Commission and Parliamentary activities, where they have the potential to influence the way the industries in 
[normal]the UK operate.  In percentage terms the tonnages of UK extracted (non-energy) minerals and downstream products owned by overseas listed companies is about 75%, the remainder (UK owned, but not necessarily listed) being solely involved in UK based operatio
[normal]ns.  It should be noted in this context that the level of regulation, the high cost of energy and difficulties in establishing reserves with planning consents (replenishing land banks) has the potential to divert future investment in the UK to more profita
[normal]ble operations overseas, thus endangering the resource security of essential minerals for the UK market.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.  What are the corporate governance concerns raised by the number of extractive industries companies listed in the UK? Are there reputational risks [bold]for the UK and UK financial institutions in being a centre for such businesses?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]We would point out that the Mineral Products industry in the UK operates in a regulated environment and exhibits high standards of sustainability performance.  For a number of
[normal] years the MPA has published Sustainable Development reports indicating:
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]6.  Is there sufficient engagement between UK extractive industries and the NGO sector?[bold] Are there examples of best practice in engagement between the extractive industries and NGOs?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The relationship between the extractive minerals industries in the UK and the NGOs has been transformed over the past decade or so, such that the joint work and
[normal] initiatives being carried out in the UK are now signalled as exemplars worldwide.    It is on record, for example, that Natural England, as the English environmental policy advisor to Government, has stated that the MPA members have the ability, with care
[normal]fully managed operations and subsequent site restoration, to satisfy 100% of nine out of 11 UK Biodiversity Action Plan targets 
[normal]on their own[bold].  Further, NE has said that the UK extractive minerals industries “are uniquely placed…..” to enhance biodiversity in the country and, in tandem with the RSPB and the industries, has created an initiative called “Nature after Minerals”, which has as its b
[normal]asis the desire to ensure that extractive operations and restoration make the most beneficial contribution to UK biodiversity over the long term. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There has been a particularly productive relationship developed between the UK’s marine 
[normal]aggregate 
[normal]dredging i
[normal]ndustry, regulators, agencies and NGOs which has resulted in a greater understanding of the marine environment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]One factor in the closer relationship between the UK mineral products industry and NGOs was the availability of funding from the UK aggregates 
[normal]levy through the operation of the Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund (ALSF). The ALSF was set up when the aggregates levy was introduced in 2002 to direct a proportion of levy revenues into initiatives to minimise environmental impacts and support local c
[normal]ommunity initiatives. Over a number of years about 6% of aggregates levy funding was used for ALSF purposes. Although independent research identified significant benefits and value for money arising from the ALSF, the scheme was scrapped by Government in E
[normal]ngland in 2011 and the only part of the UK in which the schemes continues is Wales. The marine aggregates ALSF programme was described recently by the body representing industry, regulator, agency and NGO interests as 
[normal]“one of the most substantial investmen
[normal]ts in UK marine research 
[normal]that has taken place this decade
[normal]”
[normal] and the outputs from this programme have delivered significant added value in supporting the UK Government’s wider objectives for sustainable marine management, particularly the development of mari
[normal]ne planning.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This very effective mechanism to encourage positive and productive projects and initiatives involving industry, NGOs and other interested parties could be viewed as a template for co-operative work in the extractive se
[normal]ctor elsewhere in the wo
[normal]rld. MP
[normal]A believes that the withdrawal of the ALSF in England n 2011 was a short sighted and damaging decision by Government.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The MPA’s Biodiversity and Restoration Awards, to be held in London on 16 October, will amplify these strong relationships and con
[normal]tributions developed with NGOs and other organisations.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]7.  Does the UK have the skills base to remain a centre for the extractive industries and to ensure that UK based businesses benefit from potential future opportunities such as shale gas?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The experi
[normal]ence of the MPA members is that the average age of the workforce has increased to the extent that a high percentage of those (directly) employed is now over 50 years old.  The question remains as to whether there is, or has been sufficient backfilling with
[normal] the right numbers and levels of expertise, itself asking a supplementary question about the depth and quality of education and training available, as much as a wider one on the image of the extractive industries and their attractiveness to newer generatio
[normal]ns!  The requisite skills base is probably in place, but whether is being directed accurately to fulfil the future further demands of the extractive minerals industries is less certain. Further, with the reduction or closure of certain types of extraction 
[normal]industry, notably underground mining, in the UK there are fewer sites where trainees can learn their trade by practical, hands on site training in this country, 
[normal]which has reduced still further the ability to provide high quality experts in relevant fields.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The mineral products industry is now working closely with the University of Derby to support the establishment and development of the University as a centre of excellence for extractive industry education. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.  What is the impact of the industry of the [bold]UK signing up to the EITI?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Government decision to sign up to the EITI initiative was taken without consultation with the largest element of the extractive industry in the UK, represented by the MPA. British Geological Survey identifies UK mineral prod
[normal]uction as follows:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Given the scale of aggregates related mineral extraction in the UK we are surprised that there has been no substantive consultation or discussion with the UK minerals product industry to date.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The EITI requires significant
[normal] reporting and verification of data from extractive industries operating in the UK but we have yet to receive clarity about the implications for UK operators.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]9.  Would increased regulation for London listed extractives companies result in competition fro[bold]m elsewhere or can it be used to make the UK a centre of excellence for best practice and corporate governance?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The question is not so much about the regulation of the listed companies, but the regulation of the industries’ activities: the two are quite d
[normal]ifferent issues.  MPA cannot comment on the former, but can comment on the latter! 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] In this case it can be argued that the UK extractive minerals industries are already amongst the most heavily regulated industries in both the country and, probably, inte
[normal]rnationally.  An MPA assessment in 2012 identified 228 laws and regulations related to planning and environmental matters requiring management by the mineral products industry.  There will be some items of legislation or regulation that seem misdirected or
[normal] superfluous, but one thing is absolutely clear: the industry does not need any more regulation.  In terms of the UK being a centre of best practice on the world stage, there is no doubt that that is the case for the operations of the extraction processes 
[normal]and all that goes therewith.  MPA cannot comment on whether this applies equally to corporate governance.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10. What is the competitive landscape for the extractive industries in the 21st Century and is it in the UK’s interest to remain a global centre [bold]for them?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The ownership of the UK extractive minerals industries has changed significantly over the past two decades.  20 years ago, ownership of the industries was almost exclusively in UK listed or private company hands.  However, within the MPA areas o
[normal]f responsibility some 75% of extractive production, by volume and value, is now owned by international companies not based in the UK or listed in London.   The ownership of larger private and public SMEs operating in the UK is both UK and overseas based an
[normal]d the 300 plus smaller SMEs operating in the UK are very largely private UK – owned businesses.
