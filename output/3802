default&#xa0;
defaultThe Minerals Products Association (MPA) is the trade association representing the aggregates, asphalt
default,
default cement, concrete and related industries. Our industry delivers 200 million tonnes of materials to customers in the UK every year. While the industry is a major user of road and sea/water transport modes, most materials are delivered to customers by road a
defaultnd the industry is a major user of the road network. As most construction activity is in urban areas our industry is also a significant user of urban roads.
defaultThis follow up inquiry follows recent cyclist fatalities in London and we would like to make concis
defaulte comments on two areas highlighted n the Committee’s request for evidence.
defaultWhat central and local Government could do to improve cycling defaultsafety.default Ideas could include better training and advice for drivers and cyclists, better enforcement of the law applyindefaultg to drivers and cyclists, and better vehicle and road infrastructure.defaultDriver training, vehicle equipment and procurement conditionsdefaultMPA introduced a Cycle Safety Strategy in 2011 with six broad aims, as follows:
defaultIn 2012 we followed this up with a Vu
defaultlnerable Road User
default Safety
default Policy covering the delivery of materials on behalf of member companies in the main types of industry delivery vehicles, tippers, 
defaulttruckmixers
default and tankers.
defaultThe policy includes
default requirements for specific vulnerable road user training
default for drivers, the fitting of blind spot 
defaultelimination equipment to large goods 
defaultvehicles
default(
default such as nearside cameras and/or side sensors) and 
defaultsideguard
default protection to all tipper lorries (this is not a leg
defaultal requirement currently). The
default policy applies to 
defaultne
defaultw 
defaultvehic
defaultles and there is also a retrofitting requirement for existing vehicles.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default In addition action by MPA and member companies includes:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultMPA is
default now wor
defaultking closely with Transport for London 
defaultand other interested parties 
defaulton the development of procurement guidelines for construction clients and contractors to use – covering vulnerable road user safety issues through the delivery supply chain.
default The intention is that these guidelines will be regarded as a consistent national standard for application to construction contracts.
default&#xa0;
defaultFrom the perspective of the major supply sector for the construction industry we believe that the approach which we have 
defaultadopted, focussing on high quality driver training and the fitting of appropriate equipment to 
defaultLarge Goods Vehicles, should make a positive contribution to cycling safety.
default&#xa0;
defaultEnforcementdefault - Generaldefault&#xa0;defaultEnforcement of regulations by all road users is a key aspect
default of improving 
defaultroad safety. We have no difficulty in active enforcement of LGVs as it is unreasonable if poor operators with low operating standards are allowed to undermine operators with higher standards.
default&#xa0;
defaultEnforcement – Specific Issuedefault&#xa0;
defaultIn addition we have
default b
defaulteen urging Government since 2010
default to take action to close regulatory loopholes which allow certain types of engineering plant to operate on public roads with very little regul
defaultatory control. Specifically, so-
defaultcalled Volumetric Plant are currently permitted 
defaultto deliver large volumes of concrete to customers 
default( we
default estimate 2 million cubic metres of ready mixed concrete per annum – 10% of the total market). 
defaultThe legal position is that there is a definition of Engineering Plant covering plant/vehicles which are spe
defaultcifically designed for use in engineering operations - e.g. road construction plant - but this
default&#xa0;
defaultdefinition is not designed to include road going vehicles. Engineering plant 
defaulthave
default&#xa0;
defaultmuch lighter regulatory requirements than LGVs, for example:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWe believe
default that all vehicles/plant delivering construction materials
default should be subject to common LGV regulations and that if Government does not take urgent action to ensu
defaultre that volumetric plant are
default regulated to LGV standards there are clear and adverse implication
defaults for road safety and in particular for the safety of vulnerable road users. We have been pressing Government to take such action since 2010 and are extremely disappointed that no material action has been taken in spite of the outstanding and obvious case 
defaultto do so.

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultWhether it would be desirable and feasible to segregate cyclists from other road users, including, for example, by prohibiting HGVs from entering city centres at peak hours.default&#xa0;
defaultWe support the segregation of cyclists from other road users where this is possible but this is not likely to be feasible in all cases given the limited road space available in many urban areas. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere has been some discussion of rush hour lorry bans but 
defaultthere are real practical issues that need recognition and consideration, for example:
