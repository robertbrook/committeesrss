[normal]Written evidence from Mineral Products Association (CYS0048)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Minerals Products Association (MPA) is the trade association representing the aggregates, asphalt
[normal],
[normal] cement, concrete and related industries. Our industry delivers 200 million tonnes of materials to customers in the UK every year. While the industry is a major user of road and sea/water transport modes, most materials are delivered to customers by road a
[normal]nd the industry is a major user of the road network. As most construction activity is in urban areas our industry is also a significant user of urban roads.
[normal]This follow up inquiry follows recent cyclist fatalities in London and we would like to make concis
[normal]e comments on two areas highlighted n the Committee’s request for evidence.
[normal]What central and local Government could do to improve cycling [bold]safety.[bold] Ideas could include better training and advice for drivers and cyclists, better enforcement of the law applyin[bold]g to drivers and cyclists, and better vehicle and road infrastructure.[bold]Driver training, vehicle equipment and procurement conditions[bold]MPA introduced a Cycle Safety Strategy in 2011 with six broad aims, as follows:
[normal]In 2012 we followed this up with a Vu
[normal]lnerable Road User
[normal] Safety
[normal] Policy covering the delivery of materials on behalf of member companies in the main types of industry delivery vehicles, tippers, 
[normal]truckmixers
[normal] and tankers.
[normal]The policy includes
[normal] requirements for specific vulnerable road user training
[normal] for drivers, the fitting of blind spot 
[normal]elimination equipment to large goods 
[normal]vehicles
[normal](
[normal] such as nearside cameras and/or side sensors) and 
[normal]sideguard
[normal] protection to all tipper lorries (this is not a leg
[normal]al requirement currently). The
[normal] policy applies to 
[normal]ne
[normal]w 
[normal]vehic
[normal]les and there is also a retrofitting requirement for existing vehicles.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] In addition action by MPA and member companies includes:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]MPA is
[normal] now wor
[normal]king closely with Transport for London 
[normal]and other interested parties 
[normal]on the development of procurement guidelines for construction clients and contractors to use – covering vulnerable road user safety issues through the delivery supply chain.
[normal] The intention is that these guidelines will be regarded as a consistent national standard for application to construction contracts.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]From the perspective of the major supply sector for the construction industry we believe that the approach which we have 
[normal]adopted, focussing on high quality driver training and the fitting of appropriate equipment to 
[normal]Large Goods Vehicles, should make a positive contribution to cycling safety.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Enforcement[bold] - General[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Enforcement of regulations by all road users is a key aspect
[normal] of improving 
[normal]road safety. We have no difficulty in active enforcement of LGVs as it is unreasonable if poor operators with low operating standards are allowed to undermine operators with higher standards.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Enforcement – Specific Issue[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]In addition we have
[normal] b
[normal]een urging Government since 2010
[normal] to take action to close regulatory loopholes which allow certain types of engineering plant to operate on public roads with very little regul
[normal]atory control. Specifically, so-
[normal]called Volumetric Plant are currently permitted 
[normal]to deliver large volumes of concrete to customers 
[normal]( we
[normal] estimate 2 million cubic metres of ready mixed concrete per annum – 10% of the total market). 
[normal]The legal position is that there is a definition of Engineering Plant covering plant/vehicles which are spe
[normal]cifically designed for use in engineering operations - e.g. road construction plant - but this
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]definition is not designed to include road going vehicles. Engineering plant 
[normal]have
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]much lighter regulatory requirements than LGVs, for example:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We believe
[normal] that all vehicles/plant delivering construction materials
[normal] should be subject to common LGV regulations and that if Government does not take urgent action to ensu
[normal]re that volumetric plant are
[normal] regulated to LGV standards there are clear and adverse implication
[normal]s for road safety and in particular for the safety of vulnerable road users. We have been pressing Government to take such action since 2010 and are extremely disappointed that no material action has been taken in spite of the outstanding and obvious case 
[normal]to do so.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Whether it would be desirable and feasible to segregate cyclists from other road users, including, for example, by prohibiting HGVs from entering city centres at peak hours.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]We support the segregation of cyclists from other road users where this is possible but this is not likely to be feasible in all cases given the limited road space available in many urban areas. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There has been some discussion of rush hour lorry bans but 
[normal]there are real practical issues that need recognition and consideration, for example:
