"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by the International Labour OrganizationPeople with disabilities make up around 15 per cent of the global population – over 1 billion people \n– \nand \nthus \nform a significant minority group with \ngreat \npotential to contribute to the development of their communities and society. Yet many of those of working age (at least 780 million people) are prevented from making this contribution due to physical, social, economic and cultural barriers that hinder thei\nr access to education, skills development, employment, health services and society more broadly on an equal basis with others. \nWhile reliable, comparable data on the labour market participation of people with disabilities is not widely available, common p\natterns are reported in countries at different levels of development. Compared to non-disabled persons, people with disabilities are less likely to be in full-time employment; more likely to be unemployed; and significantly more likely to be economically i\nnactive. In developing countries, they are more likely to work in the informal economy.  When in employment, workers with disabilities are more likely to count among the working poor, as they are frequently in low-paid jobs with poor career prospects and w\norking conditions. Disabled women are less likely to have a decent job than either non-disabled women or men with disabilities, and people with certain types of disability – such as intellectual and mental health disabilities face greater difficulties in f\ninding and retaining employment. \n \nThese patterns reflect a serious waste of human \nresources that\n could be tapped to contribute to development at local, regional and national levels, if adequate measures were taken.\n The exclusion of people with disabilitie\ns from the world of work and their location at the margins of society in many countries has high macro-economic costs.\nAccordingly, investment\ns\n in more effective strategies for \nthe \ninclusion of persons with disabilities can yield large economic returns to \nsociety. For example, in Australia, a cumulative \nAUD\n 43 billion\n (about \nGBP 24\n billion)\n increase in Gross Domestic Product over the next decade is predicted if the gaps\n \nbetween the unemployment and labour force participation of people with and without\n \ndisab\nilit\nies are reduced by one third.\nA \nrecently published \nILO \nstudy \nfound that the annual loss of Gross Domestic Product attributed to the exclusion of persons with disabilities from employment opportunities ranged from 3 to 7 per cent in ten selected Asian \nand African countries. \nBuilding on previous research, this study developed a new approach that takes two drivers of economic losses into account: Firstly, the gap between the potential and the actual productivity of people with disabilities; This is essen\ntial to indicate that people with disabilities are less productive not because they are “disabled” but because they live and work in environments that are “disabling”. The second driver that is taken into account is the difference between unemployment and \ninactivity rates of non-disabled people and people with disabilities. Together, these drivers yield the costs that society has to bear for excluding people with disabilities from the world of work.\n&#xa0;\nOverview of economic losses related to disability, by source&#xa0;\nEconomic losses\nSources of economic losses\nTotal (in millions US \nDollars\n)\n% GDP\n% Productivity\n% Exclusion\nChina111,693 \n4.2251.40\n48.60\nThailand9,576\n4.6436.53\n63.47\nViet Nam1,821\n2.9964.75\n35.25\nEthiopia667\n5.0141.10\n58.90\nMalawi99\n3.1240.85\n59.15\nNamibia286\n4.3516.12\n83.88\nSouth Africa17,818\n6.9881.43\n18.57\nTanzania480\n3.7617.02\n82.98\nZambia498\n4.6448.32\n51.68\nZimbabwe128\n3.7517.92\n82.08\nSource:\n International Labour Offic\ne (2009) The price of exclusion\n: the economic\n consequences of excluding people with disabilities from the world of work; Employment working paper No. 43 (available online at: \nhttp://www.ilo.org/public/libdoc/ilo/2009/109B09_29\n1_engl.pdf\n)\nThe ILO promotes the employability and employment of women and men with disabilities through its standards on discrimination and disability, the development of knowledge on good practice in training and employment, policy advisory and advocacy work, and do\nnor-funded technical cooperation projects. \nThe key elements of a rights-based approach \n–\n equality of opportunity, equal treatment and non-discrimination \n–\n are contained in ILO Conventions concerning employment in general and persons with disabilities in p\narticular.
