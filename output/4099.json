"Written evidence submitted by the Coram Children’s Legal Centre (JRR 0038)Coram Children’s Legal Centre&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nStanding&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThird party interventions… In recent years the House has frequently been assisted by the submissions of statutory bodies and non-governmenta\nl organisations on questions of general public importance. Leave is given to such bodies to intervene and make submissions, usually in writing but sometimes orally from the bar, in the expectation that their fund of knowledge or particular point of view wi\nll enable them to provide the House with a more rounded picture than it would otherwise obtain. The House is grateful to such bodies for their help.\nRecognising this, the Supreme \nCourt\n will not ordinarily make costs orders against \nthird\n parties\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOnce a matter is in court, the more important the subject, the more difficult the issues, the more help we need to try and get the right answer. ... No particular formality is required and t\nhe invitation is a very open one, but not I think abused.\nCommenting that ‘provided they stick to the rules, interventions are enormously helpful’, she noted specifically that ‘[o]\nne\n thing that interveners can do, which the parties may find it more diffic\nult and more costly to do, is to draw our attention to international jurisprudence which may be relevant to the issue’.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Costs&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nProcedural defects&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;The Public Sector Equality Duty&#xa0;Impact AssessmentEnsuring that the best interests of the child are a primary consideration in all actions concerning children (art. 3(1)), and t\nhat all the provisions of the Convention are respected in legislation and policy development and delivery at all levels of government demands a continuous process of child impact assessment (predicting the impact of any proposed law, policy or budgetary al\nlocation which affects children and the enjoyment of their rights) and child impact evaluation (evaluating the actual impact of implementation). This process needs to be built into government at all levels and as early as possible in the development of pol\nicy.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Combined effects of the proposals with the proposed residence test for civil legal aid&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCombined effects of the proposals with appeals provisions in the Immigration Bill&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember\n 2013\n7\n&#xa0;\n Consultation paper, paragraph 78\n Consultation paper, page 24, footnote 38\n Consultation paper, paragraph 79\n Consultation paper, paragraph 80\n Consultation paper, paragraph 8\n See Supreme Court Practice Direct\nion 8 (interveners)\n \nhttp://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/procedures/practice-direction-08.html#08\n Supreme Court Rules 2009 part 7 Rule 46 (3)\n \nhttp://www.publiclawproject.org.uk/documents/JR_Proposals_for_further_reform_briefing.pdf\n \nHH &amp; others\n UKSC 25 2013 - paragraphs 21, 33 and 144\n Lady Hale address to the Public Law Project conference 2013, ‘Who guards the guardians?’, available at \nhttp://www.publiclawproject.org.uk/data/resource\ns/144/PLP_conference_Lady_Hale_address.pdf\n \n Ibid\n \n \nHC v SSHD &amp; Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis\n \n[2013] EWHC 982 (Admin)\n  \nSM &amp; others v SSHD\n \n[2013] EWHC 1144 (Admin) Holman J at paragraphs 4 and 5\n  \n&#xa0;\n \n[2013] EWHC 982 (Admin) at  Annex 2\n  Consultation paper, paragraph 99\n Article 4, UN Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989\n Article 3, UN Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989\n \nGeneral Comment No. 5, \nGeneral measures of implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child\n (arts. 4, 42 and 44, \npara\n. 6) \nCRC/GC/2003/5 at paragraph 45\n"
