[[[Proposed small business exemption]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“We need to charge for plastic bags. Customers will only cut back on usage if it will cost them money. We would be delighted to give the money raised to charity, and it would not be difficult to organise. Please lobby the Government to include small shops.” David Charman, Owner, Parkfoot Garage Ltd.&#xa0;&#xa0;
