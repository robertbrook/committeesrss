[normal]ii. As part of improving their provision for financial education we
[normal] encourage
[normal] the schools involved to 
[normal]form 
[normal]meaningful and 
[normal]lasting partnerships 
[normal]with the 
[normal]supporters 
[normal](funders) 
[normal]of 
[normal]the
[normal] programme
[normal]. 
[normal]Supporters
[normal] currently
[normal] include Experian
[normal], Santander, JP Morgan, the Building Societies Trust, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Prudential, Threadneedle and M&amp;G Investments. 
[normal]We facilitate financial education employee volunteering opportunities to make financial education real and relevant to
[normal] young 
[normal]people’s lives, and to help 
[normal]pupils link learning in the classroom with life outside. Appropriate inputs from private sector industry experts can make a real impact on outcomes for students and can add significant social capital to disadvantaged young peopl
[normal]e, particularly in relation to their aspirations around work
[normal], career choices
[normal] and future lifestyle.

[normal]Crucially, as an independent charity with financial education expertise, we provide an essential quality assurance role in ensuring that information 
[normal]and
[normal] resources
[normal] used by teachers and students are impartial and free from 
[normal]branding
[normal]. We also 
[normal]ensure supporters’ employees are adequately prepared for their volunteering experiences so the best possible outcomes are achieved for students.
