defaultWritten Submission from the RSPBdefaultDecember 2013defaultAbout the RSPB defaultThe Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (the RSPB) is the largest wildlife conservation organisation in Europe with over one million members. We believe that sustainability should be at the heart of decision-making. The RSPB’s policy and practical wo
defaultrk covers a wide range of issues including 
defaultagriculture
default, 
defaultwater
default,
default 
defaultclimate change, energy, 
defaultplanning  and 
defaultmarine issues. 
defaultWe also manage one of the largest conservation estates in the UK, covering c.143, 000 hectares. Around sixty of our reserves are farmed, co
defaultvering more than 20,000 hectares, with around 170 tenant farmers, and 200 employees. We protect and enhance habitats such as lowland farmland, heather moorland, lowland heath, wet grassland, estuaries and reed beds, and our reserves help to protect 63 of t
defaulthe 77 most rare or threatened breeding birds in the UK. 
defaultSummarydefaultFood security is an issue in the UK, not because there is a lack of food
default 
defaultbut because of poverty and inequality.  In the long-term, food security ultimately depends on maintaining the productive capacity of agriculture and 
defaulttherefore 
defaultis inherently linked to the concept of sustainability. One of the major threats to future food se
defaultcurity is the unsustainable nature of the current global food system. 
defaultEnvironmental
default degradation 
defaultpresents a real threat to the UK’s food security because
default it undermines th
defaulte UK’s ability to produce food.
default1.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUK (and EU) food security would best be improved by a complete overhaul of the current 
defaultagriculture and food 
defaultpolicy framework
default to ensure its long term sustainability
default. 
defaultA series of high level reports have highlighted the nee
defaultd for 
defaulta transition to a more sustainable agricultural model
default. 
defaultThe current 
defaultsystem
default 
defaultreceives
default high levels of 
defaultpublic 
defaultsupport 
defaultbut fails to
default work 
defaultin the public interest
default.
default 
defaultThe
default Natural Capital Committee recently highlighted that 
defaultthe UK’s 
defaultnatural capital assets are 
defaultin decline at an unprecedented rate
default. 
defaultT
defaulthese assets underpin long term productivity. 
defaultUrgent a
defaultction is needed t
defaulto shift 
defaultthe
default production model on to a more sustainable footing.
default 
default1.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGovernment should build on the findings of the National Ecosystem Assessment and re
defaultcognise that agriculture should be appropriate to the natural environment which underpins it
default. F
defaultood production is one of a suite of services that society needs from land and we should aim for the optimal balance between 
defaultthis range of 
defaultservices
default. F
defaultocussing 
defaultsol
defaultely 
defaulton
default maximum food production
default and efficiency
default 
defaultcould
default jeopardise the natural resources 
defaultwhich underpin production
default.
default1.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAlthough it is clearly important to use resources efficiently to avoid waste, when 
defaultdetermining the best approach to
default 
defaultsecure long term production 
defaulttargets
default efficiency must 
defaultnot be the primary driver. 
defaultE
defaultfficiency – based on extreme specialisation – 
defaultcan result in decreased
default resilience
default within the farming system
default. 
defaultInstead the
default overarching aim must b
defaulte
default to achieve sustainable food production to ensure 
defaultlong term f
defaultood 
defaultproduction
default. 
default1.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAn approach which considers only the 
defaultefficiency
default of certain elements of the system could result in 
defaultapproaches
default which 
defaultare
default fundamentally unsustainable in the long term
default,
default fail to make best use of the land in a given area
default 
defaultn
defaultor
default deliver the greatest benefit for society
default and indeed could be more susceptible to failure 
defaultdue to a lack of resilience
default 
default(see discussion below)
default.
default1.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is no 
defaultsingle 
defaultcorrect approach to more sustainable agricultural system. 
defaultFarms should ensure that the levels a
defaultnd type of production respect and operate within environmental limits, recognising and responding to the particular tensions with environment that exist in its location.
default There are a number of considerations which can help guide decisions. Any 
defaultfarm
default 
defaultwhich is
default seeking to be sustainable should aim to
default:
default enhance soil quality
default;
default protect and enhance carbon stores
default;
default 
defaultenhance 
defaultand 
defaultsustain 
defaultwildlife
default;
default utilise a variety of crop types and livestock breeds to maintain genetic diversity
default;
default minimise direct and indirect Greenhouse gas
default (GHG) emissions 
default(
defaultin total terms and not just per unit of output including carbon sequestration and storage impacts
default)
default, eliminate pollution
default and adverse impacts on the 
defaultwater environment
default and not compromise the ability of other countries to manage their own lan
defaultd sustainably.
default1.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA consideration of all these 
defaultelements 
defaultundoubtedly
default adds to the complexity of the task but will also ensure
default that we are investing in approaches which secure our natural resources and food security in the longer term
default. 
default1.7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn addition to improving the sustainability of production 
defaultthe
defaultre is a need to encourage the uptake of a
default more sustainable diet to make the best use of land and tackle the epidemic of diet related illness which afflicts those on western
default style 
defaultdiets
default 
default(
defaultcharacter
defaultise
defaultd
default by high intakes of red meat and dairy
default, sugary and high-fat foods, refined grains 
defaultand 
defaultprocessed meat
default)
default. 
defaultThe predicted rise in demand for food – potentially doubling by 2050 - comes not primarily from increasing populations
default but
default from changing diets. The r
defaultise of the middle classes 
defaultin countries such as 
defaultChina and India will result in 
defaulta demand for 
defaultdiets richer in 
defaultmeat putting increased demand on the global food system
default.
default 
defaultTo 
defaultensure that the UK is leading the way in demonstrating integrated policy which recognise
defaults the importance of sustainable consumption as part of solution to 
defaultfood security g
defaultovernment
default must take action to facilitate the uptake of more sustainable dietary choices.
default The recent green food project developed a set of principles for a sustainable diet
default which should be developed and communicated to highlight the
default importance of changing our diets for 
defaultsociety’s
default health and that of the environment.  
default2.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIf we are to achieve a sustainable fo
defaultod and farming system it is important that the price of food accurately reflects the costs of producing it
default and any public subsidies are 
defaulttransparent and clear in their aims
default. The negative externalities of unsustainable production systems should be reflected 
defaultin the price of food
default rather than being paid for elsewhere
default. 
defaultAlongside a robust regulatory baseline t
defaulthis 
defaultwill
default benefit sustainable producers
default,
default improv
defaulte
default our long term food security, increas
defaulte
default resilience through more diversity in farming systems and reduc
defaulte
default the lik
defaultelihood of extreme price fluctuations.  For example, the reliance of intensive livestock production in the UK on imported protein means these systems lack resilience and are vulnerable to increases in input prices
default.
default2.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere
default is insufficient transparency and clarity about where the money goes to in the food and farming system, both in terms of money paid at the till and public funding
default and the impacts on the health of our 
defaultcountryside. The
default complexity of the Common Agricultural Policy 
defaultis 
defaulta barrier to understanding of the 
defaultimpact of this
default policy 
defaulton the
default environment, while lack of transparency in the food supply chain makes choosing sustainable options difficult. The public’s ability to discrimin
defaultate between options in order to support more sustainable producers is made difficult
default.
default 
defaultThe result of this is that the most
default sustainable  farmers are 
defaultdisadvantaged
default. 
defaultThere needs to be 
defaultmuch greater transparency, awareness and accountability 
defaultwithin the food sys
defaulttem to correct this imbalance.
default 
default2.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is often a lack of clarity over 
defaultwhere 
defaultconsumers 
defaultmoney goes 
defaultwith
defaultin the food supply chain. An organic lamb can be sold in 
defaultmajor
default retailers at £13.98/kg, but the farmer who produced it on the hills of a National Park, usin
defaultg no inputs and extensively reared, receives only £1.98/kg, often 
defaultthe same as 
defaultnon-organic 
defaultproducers
default higher input systems. 
defaultG
defaultreater transparency within the food 
defaultsystem is needed 
defaultto 
defaultenable the public to better understand where their money is going by creating
default clear lines of accountability between producers, processors, retailers, shoppers and taxpayers. 
defaultThis would provide clarity on which sectors get most 'value-added' down the food chain, and 
defaulthelp ensure that a fair share of the cost of food
default flow
defaults
default to the most
default sustainable primary growers and farmers.
default 
default2.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is no shortage of food in the UK today but there are people who are unable to eat a good diet as they are unable to afford it or access it. Producing more food at the expense of our environments health and 
defaultpotentially public health, is not a solution to this problem. The Marmot review
default into social-related health inequalities in England, ‘Fair Society, Healthy Lives’, sets out a framework for action to ensure social justice, health and sustainability are at t
defaulthe heart of all policies. Recommendations include promoting sustainable local communities, access to good quality green space and sustainable food production.
default3.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGovernment 
defaultstatistics show that the UK is over 60% self-sufficient in food (or over 70% if you consider only the foods that can actually be grown here). By comparison, we were less than 50% self sufficient for much of the 1930s, 40s, and 50s. So although 
defaultthe UK is
default mo
defaultre self reliant than 
defaultit was 
defaultwe are still part of the global market and as such will be subject to the fluctuations which exist. 
defaultThe UK can play a role in helping to reduce 
defaultthe impact of these fluctuations 
defaultby developing a more sustainable 
defaultand resilient 
defaultappr
defaultoach to 
defaultour domestic agricultural system and so reducing our reliance on imported 
defaultfeedstocks
default and the exposure of our food and farming systems to ext
defaulternal shocks, be they economic, physical or 
defaultenvironmental
default. 
default3.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK should play a leading role in the interna
defaulttional policy debate to eliminate harmful policies such as those which result in 
defaultbiofuels
default driving up commodity prices.
default 
defaultF
defaultuture volatility will be connected to extreme weather events or shifts in growing conditions linked to climate change. 
defaultTherefore f
defaultood 
defaultsecurity policies will be increasingly 
defaultdependant
default on international action to secure a global deal limiting dangerous climate change, and on domestic action to ensure sustainable adaptation to new climate conditions for agriculture in the UK.
default4.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultScience has an important role to play in developing a more sustainable 
defaultand resilient 
defaultagricultural system
default to ensure future UK food security
default. 
defaultThe UK could take a leading role in developi
defaultng new models of sustainable agriculture which meet the need to produce enough to feed a growing population within environmental limits. In order to achieve this r
defaultesearch must take a 
defaultbroad
default perspective and 
defaultfully address 
defaultthe environmental impacts as well as 
defaultthe agronomic.
default 
defaultCurrently there is an issue that research is 
defaultsiloed
default and as such fails to take account of the 
defaultmultifunctional nature of agriculture. 
default 
defaultResearch should focus on 
defaultsustainable production methods which address both farm
default, 
defaultfarming 
defaultsystem and 
defaultlandscape
default levels.
default It is vital that the use of any technology does not lead to further narrowing of the range of crops grown: diversity is key to ensuring resilience in the face of unpredictable change.
default 
default4.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWith regard to GM technology there may be potential f
defaultor GM crops which contribute to a more sustainable agricultural system however this has not been the focus of developments to date, indeed the predominant GM crops are those which facilitate the use of agr
defaulto
defaultchemicals 
defaultwhich can damage soil 
defaultand do not encoura
defaultge integrated pest control. In 
defaultdeveloping and implementing new research
default the following
default considerations should be taken into account:
default4.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is a need to improve the dissemination of research 
defaultfindings through effective knowledge transfer systems to ensure that reaches farmers and to allow them to adapt their farming systems accordingly.
default5.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe horsemeat scandal at the start of this year highlighted 
defaultboth 
defaultthe importan
defaultce
default of t
defaultransparen
defaultcy within 
defaultsupply cha
defaultins, 
defaultand the need for effective oversight. The ability to trace the provenance of food is key 
defaultboth to 
defaultmaintain
defaulting
default consumer trust
default and u
defaultnderstand
defaulting
default the environmental impact of a product
default.
default 
defaultShorter more 
defaulttransparent food
default chain
defaults are
default essential 
defaultto 
defaultdevelop a better understanding of where the money goes within the food system for a range of products
default as discussed above
default. 
defaultShorter supply chains would 
defaulthelp enhance traceability and build trust, but also to allow environmentally friendly farming to be supported via more direct connections to markets.
default5.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA better understanding of the true costs of production can help improve resilience in its broadest sense, 
defaultthrough a better understanding of the weaknesses in the system. 
defaultA more detailed exploration of the importance of resilience is given below.
default6.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn the UK clim
defaultate change is predicted to result in 
defaultincreased temperatures and increased rainfall extremes, however it is not clear what this will mean for crop yields
default. I
defaultt is 
defaultexpected 
defaultthat 
defaultthe 
defaultUK 
defaultwill
default remain food secure over the next 40 years
default. 
defaultBuilding resilience 
defaultin
defaultto the farming sector will be an important strategy to minimise both economic and output losses 
defaultdue to extreme weather events
default. 
default6.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthere is no consensus
default on a definition of resilience
default – the ability to absorb shock and, in some definitions the ability to change
default or reorganise as a response to such a shock
default is often cited
default. 
defaultIt 
defaulthas been described
default as the ability of social-ecological system
defaults,
default both to withstand perturbations from
default,
default for instance
default,
default climate or economic shocks
default,
default and to rebuild and renew itself afterwards. Loss
default of resilience can cause loss of valuable ecosystem services
default.
default6.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSociety and institutions often find it difficult to shift to more resilient models
default. The
defaultre are many reasons for this
default. T
defaulthe fact we work in hierarchies and silos
default 
defaultmay make 
defaultit difficult to understand the interconnections 
defaultand potential benefits of different approaches.
default  
defaultIn agriculture, t
defaulthe 
defaultuse of monocultures where diversity is denied in the pursuit of economies of scale 
defaultcan make change difficult
default. 
defaultAnother reason is the attract
defaultion 
defaultof focusing
default on efficiency and 
defaultshort term profit maximisation, this increases 
defaultthe risk that economic models quickly buckle when stress is applied.
default Finally a failure
default to invest in appropriate infrastructure to underpin more resilient models
default can present a
defaultn
default obstacle
default. 
default6.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn order to overcome these issues we need to 
defaultaccept 
defaultthe complexity of systems and rather than seek to oversimplify them
default,
default 
defaultbetter recognise the multiple benefits which are 
defaultdelivered by 
defaultsuch 
defaultsystems
default,
default  e.g. sustaining 
defaultbio
defaultdiversity, living within ec
defaultological boundaries
default and 
default generating social capital. 
default6.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFor example 
defaultUK agriculture’s 
defaultincreasing specialisation into specific farming types, contraction of crop rotations, increased stocking density and reduction of genetic diversity have all had profound envi
defaultronmental impacts. They have also made the system more brittle in that
default:
default 
default6.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOne approach to address these problems is to look for down
default-
defaultstream fixes 
defaulteg
default 
defaultbuild
defaulting new
default reservoirs and develop new pesticides and drugs. While 
defaultsuch actions can be useful
default,
default a more cost effective approach may
default 
defaultbe to seek to 
defaultaddress the fundamental risk of failure which could have devastating consequences in a highly specialised agricultural syst
defaultem.
default B
defaultuilding resilience through seeking alternative environmentally sustainable approaches
default,
default such as by
default extending crop rotations, us
defaulting integrated pest management and 
defaultintroducing traditional bre
defaulteds less reliant on inputs although more complex, 
defaultcan 
defaultdeliver a
default wider range of beneficial outcomes and reduce the potential impacts of extreme weather events
default.
default6.7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultInvestment in ever more efficient approaches without a proper assessment of alternative approaches can result in 
defaultsector
default becoming ‘locked in’ to unsustainable a
defaultpproaches and therefore being unable to deliver a broader range of benefit to society.
default7.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn the short term in the UK w
defaulte don’t need to increa
defaultse production
default,
default we need to make it more sustainable
default – environmentally, economically and socially
default.
default 
defaultSimply pursuing increased production does not necessarily result in increased profit and is not good for farmers, society or the environment
default. 
defaultWhat is vital is creating value - for society and for farm businesses 
default- 
defaultin sustainable ways. 
defaultFood is not the only output from our agricultural 
defaultsystem;
default 
defaultthere are a
default range of other services that matter to us all, such as water quality, carbon storage, flood a
defaultlleviation, the landscape, recreation,
default employment, high
default animal welfare and wildlife
default habitats
default. But the market often fails to 
defaultdistinguish between those 
defaultproviding these wider benefits to society, 
defaultand those who are not. Often farmers seeking to be more sustain
defaultable are unable 
defaultt
defaulto
default compete with those farming in a less sustainable way.
default7.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
default£
default3bn 
defaultpublic funding for 
defaultUK 
defaultagriculture via t
defaulthe Common Agricultural Policy should be 
defaultsupporting farmers to become more sustainable and rewarding them for the wider public goods the
defaulty produce
default. But only a tiny proportion of this expenditure represents good value for the public purse by being targeted to sustainable farmers. 
default7.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIncreasing agricultural specialisation, driven by a narrow focus on efficiency
default,
default has resulted in polarisation 
defaultof production and the loss of mixed, rotational farming that has underpinned good soil, crop and animal husbandry for centuries. Historically farms 
defaultutilised
default rotations which build soil and circulate nutrients. 
defaultMixed farms
default now find it difficult to compete wi
defaultth the extremely specialised arable and livestock systems as the benefits of mixed systems and the externalities (soil degradation, feed and nutrient imports) of intensive systems
default,
default are not reflected in our current economic model
default. This specialisation, conc
defaultentration on just a few major commodity crops and reliance on imported protein (the EU is already reliant on importing three-quarters of protein-rich feed) has left limited diversity, which combined with increasingly unpredictable extremes of weather, leav
defaultes food production vulnerable and lacking resilience.
default7.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUnderstanding and encouraging such complexity in 
defaultthe 
defaultfarming 
defaultsector 
defaultrelies on skilled advisors. Too often the provision of advice is now left to those with vested interests and narrow specialities. 
defaultIn o
defaultrder to support the shift to a more sustainable agricultural system a well informed, impartial advisory network is required.
default  
default7.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis shift 
defaultshould 
defaultbe underpinned by the infrastructure required for mixed, sustainable agriculture systems such as more small and
default medium sized abattoirs, to enable shorter chains and trustworthy traceability.
default8.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWithin this submission we have referred to a number of 
defaultactions
default we believe are requ
defaultired to support a thriving UK agricultural system. 
defaultThese 
defaultinclude better direction of support payments, investment in skills
default,
default training 
defaultand advisory support 
defaultto better equip the industry 
defaultto pursue 
defaulta more sustainable approach and investment in infrastructure
default to underpin this shift. 
default8.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA change in peoples eating habits to more sustainable diets as described above would also improve our self sufficiency. 
defaultHowever reducing use of cereals and oilseeds in animal feed through less intensive livestock farming could mak
defaulte
default the UK
default more self-sufficient in these crops and would reduce reliance on imported protein. More sustainable diets would also benefit UK horticulture
default through increased demand for vegetables
default.
