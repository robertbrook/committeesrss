[normal]Written Submission from the RSPB[bold]December 2013[bold]About the RSPB [bold]The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (the RSPB) is the largest wildlife conservation organisation in Europe with over one million members. We believe that sustainability should be at the heart of decision-making. The RSPB’s policy and practical wo
[normal]rk covers a wide range of issues including 
[normal]agriculture
[normal], 
[normal]water
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]climate change, energy, 
[normal]planning  and 
[normal]marine issues. 
[normal]We also manage one of the largest conservation estates in the UK, covering c.143, 000 hectares. Around sixty of our reserves are farmed, co
[normal]vering more than 20,000 hectares, with around 170 tenant farmers, and 200 employees. We protect and enhance habitats such as lowland farmland, heather moorland, lowland heath, wet grassland, estuaries and reed beds, and our reserves help to protect 63 of t
[normal]he 77 most rare or threatened breeding birds in the UK. 
[normal]Summary[bold]Food security is an issue in the UK, not because there is a lack of food
[normal] 
[normal]but because of poverty and inequality.  In the long-term, food security ultimately depends on maintaining the productive capacity of agriculture and 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]is inherently linked to the concept of sustainability. One of the major threats to future food se
[normal]curity is the unsustainable nature of the current global food system. 
[normal]Environmental
[normal] degradation 
[normal]presents a real threat to the UK’s food security because
[normal] it undermines th
[normal]e UK’s ability to produce food.
[normal]1.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]UK (and EU) food security would best be improved by a complete overhaul of the current 
[normal]agriculture and food 
[normal]policy framework
[normal] to ensure its long term sustainability
[normal]. 
[normal]A series of high level reports have highlighted the nee
[normal]d for 
[normal]a transition to a more sustainable agricultural model
[normal]. 
[normal]The current 
[normal]system
[normal] 
[normal]receives
[normal] high levels of 
[normal]public 
[normal]support 
[normal]but fails to
[normal] work 
[normal]in the public interest
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The
[normal] Natural Capital Committee recently highlighted that 
[normal]the UK’s 
[normal]natural capital assets are 
[normal]in decline at an unprecedented rate
[normal]. 
[normal]T
[normal]hese assets underpin long term productivity. 
[normal]Urgent a
[normal]ction is needed t
[normal]o shift 
[normal]the
[normal] production model on to a more sustainable footing.
[normal] 
[normal]1.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Government should build on the findings of the National Ecosystem Assessment and re
[normal]cognise that agriculture should be appropriate to the natural environment which underpins it
[normal]. F
[normal]ood production is one of a suite of services that society needs from land and we should aim for the optimal balance between 
[normal]this range of 
[normal]services
[normal]. F
[normal]ocussing 
[normal]sol
[normal]ely 
[normal]on
[normal] maximum food production
[normal] and efficiency
[normal] 
[normal]could
[normal] jeopardise the natural resources 
[normal]which underpin production
[normal].
[normal]1.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Although it is clearly important to use resources efficiently to avoid waste, when 
[normal]determining the best approach to
[normal] 
[normal]secure long term production 
[normal]targets
[normal] efficiency must 
[normal]not be the primary driver. 
[normal]E
[normal]fficiency – based on extreme specialisation – 
[normal]can result in decreased
[normal] resilience
[normal] within the farming system
[normal]. 
[normal]Instead the
[normal] overarching aim must b
[normal]e
[normal] to achieve sustainable food production to ensure 
[normal]long term f
[normal]ood 
[normal]production
[normal]. 
[normal]1.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]An approach which considers only the 
[normal]efficiency
[normal] of certain elements of the system could result in 
[normal]approaches
[normal] which 
[normal]are
[normal] fundamentally unsustainable in the long term
[normal],
[normal] fail to make best use of the land in a given area
[normal] 
[normal]n
[normal]or
[normal] deliver the greatest benefit for society
[normal] and indeed could be more susceptible to failure 
[normal]due to a lack of resilience
[normal] 
[normal](see discussion below)
[normal].
[normal]1.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There is no 
[normal]single 
[normal]correct approach to more sustainable agricultural system. 
[normal]Farms should ensure that the levels a
[normal]nd type of production respect and operate within environmental limits, recognising and responding to the particular tensions with environment that exist in its location.
[normal] There are a number of considerations which can help guide decisions. Any 
[normal]farm
[normal] 
[normal]which is
[normal] seeking to be sustainable should aim to
[normal]:
[normal] enhance soil quality
[normal];
[normal] protect and enhance carbon stores
[normal];
[normal] 
[normal]enhance 
[normal]and 
[normal]sustain 
[normal]wildlife
[normal];
[normal] utilise a variety of crop types and livestock breeds to maintain genetic diversity
[normal];
[normal] minimise direct and indirect Greenhouse gas
[normal] (GHG) emissions 
[normal](
[normal]in total terms and not just per unit of output including carbon sequestration and storage impacts
[normal])
[normal], eliminate pollution
[normal] and adverse impacts on the 
[normal]water environment
[normal] and not compromise the ability of other countries to manage their own lan
[normal]d sustainably.
[normal]1.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A consideration of all these 
[normal]elements 
[normal]undoubtedly
[normal] adds to the complexity of the task but will also ensure
[normal] that we are investing in approaches which secure our natural resources and food security in the longer term
[normal]. 
[normal]1.7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In addition to improving the sustainability of production 
[normal]the
[normal]re is a need to encourage the uptake of a
[normal] more sustainable diet to make the best use of land and tackle the epidemic of diet related illness which afflicts those on western
[normal] style 
[normal]diets
[normal] 
[normal](
[normal]character
[normal]ise
[normal]d
[normal] by high intakes of red meat and dairy
[normal], sugary and high-fat foods, refined grains 
[normal]and 
[normal]processed meat
[normal])
[normal]. 
[normal]The predicted rise in demand for food – potentially doubling by 2050 - comes not primarily from increasing populations
[normal] but
[normal] from changing diets. The r
[normal]ise of the middle classes 
[normal]in countries such as 
[normal]China and India will result in 
[normal]a demand for 
[normal]diets richer in 
[normal]meat putting increased demand on the global food system
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]To 
[normal]ensure that the UK is leading the way in demonstrating integrated policy which recognise
[normal]s the importance of sustainable consumption as part of solution to 
[normal]food security g
[normal]overnment
[normal] must take action to facilitate the uptake of more sustainable dietary choices.
[normal] The recent green food project developed a set of principles for a sustainable diet
[normal] which should be developed and communicated to highlight the
[normal] importance of changing our diets for 
[normal]society’s
[normal] health and that of the environment.  
[normal]2.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]If we are to achieve a sustainable fo
[normal]od and farming system it is important that the price of food accurately reflects the costs of producing it
[normal] and any public subsidies are 
[normal]transparent and clear in their aims
[normal]. The negative externalities of unsustainable production systems should be reflected 
[normal]in the price of food
[normal] rather than being paid for elsewhere
[normal]. 
[normal]Alongside a robust regulatory baseline t
[normal]his 
[normal]will
[normal] benefit sustainable producers
[normal],
[normal] improv
[normal]e
[normal] our long term food security, increas
[normal]e
[normal] resilience through more diversity in farming systems and reduc
[normal]e
[normal] the lik
[normal]elihood of extreme price fluctuations.  For example, the reliance of intensive livestock production in the UK on imported protein means these systems lack resilience and are vulnerable to increases in input prices
[normal].
[normal]2.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There
[normal] is insufficient transparency and clarity about where the money goes to in the food and farming system, both in terms of money paid at the till and public funding
[normal] and the impacts on the health of our 
[normal]countryside. The
[normal] complexity of the Common Agricultural Policy 
[normal]is 
[normal]a barrier to understanding of the 
[normal]impact of this
[normal] policy 
[normal]on the
[normal] environment, while lack of transparency in the food supply chain makes choosing sustainable options difficult. The public’s ability to discrimin
[normal]ate between options in order to support more sustainable producers is made difficult
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The result of this is that the most
[normal] sustainable  farmers are 
[normal]disadvantaged
[normal]. 
[normal]There needs to be 
[normal]much greater transparency, awareness and accountability 
[normal]within the food sys
[normal]tem to correct this imbalance.
[normal] 
[normal]2.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There is often a lack of clarity over 
[normal]where 
[normal]consumers 
[normal]money goes 
[normal]with
[normal]in the food supply chain. An organic lamb can be sold in 
[normal]major
[normal] retailers at £13.98/kg, but the farmer who produced it on the hills of a National Park, usin
[normal]g no inputs and extensively reared, receives only £1.98/kg, often 
[normal]the same as 
[normal]non-organic 
[normal]producers
[normal] higher input systems. 
[normal]G
[normal]reater transparency within the food 
[normal]system is needed 
[normal]to 
[normal]enable the public to better understand where their money is going by creating
[normal] clear lines of accountability between producers, processors, retailers, shoppers and taxpayers. 
[normal]This would provide clarity on which sectors get most 'value-added' down the food chain, and 
[normal]help ensure that a fair share of the cost of food
[normal] flow
[normal]s
[normal] to the most
[normal] sustainable primary growers and farmers.
[normal] 
[normal]2.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There is no shortage of food in the UK today but there are people who are unable to eat a good diet as they are unable to afford it or access it. Producing more food at the expense of our environments health and 
[normal]potentially public health, is not a solution to this problem. The Marmot review
[normal] into social-related health inequalities in England, ‘Fair Society, Healthy Lives’, sets out a framework for action to ensure social justice, health and sustainability are at t
[normal]he heart of all policies. Recommendations include promoting sustainable local communities, access to good quality green space and sustainable food production.
[normal]3.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Government 
[normal]statistics show that the UK is over 60% self-sufficient in food (or over 70% if you consider only the foods that can actually be grown here). By comparison, we were less than 50% self sufficient for much of the 1930s, 40s, and 50s. So although 
[normal]the UK is
[normal] mo
[normal]re self reliant than 
[normal]it was 
[normal]we are still part of the global market and as such will be subject to the fluctuations which exist. 
[normal]The UK can play a role in helping to reduce 
[normal]the impact of these fluctuations 
[normal]by developing a more sustainable 
[normal]and resilient 
[normal]appr
[normal]oach to 
[normal]our domestic agricultural system and so reducing our reliance on imported 
[normal]feedstocks
[normal] and the exposure of our food and farming systems to ext
[normal]ernal shocks, be they economic, physical or 
[normal]environmental
[normal]. 
[normal]3.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The UK should play a leading role in the interna
[normal]tional policy debate to eliminate harmful policies such as those which result in 
[normal]biofuels
[normal] driving up commodity prices.
[normal] 
[normal]F
[normal]uture volatility will be connected to extreme weather events or shifts in growing conditions linked to climate change. 
[normal]Therefore f
[normal]ood 
[normal]security policies will be increasingly 
[normal]dependant
[normal] on international action to secure a global deal limiting dangerous climate change, and on domestic action to ensure sustainable adaptation to new climate conditions for agriculture in the UK.
[normal]4.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Science has an important role to play in developing a more sustainable 
[normal]and resilient 
[normal]agricultural system
[normal] to ensure future UK food security
[normal]. 
[normal]The UK could take a leading role in developi
[normal]ng new models of sustainable agriculture which meet the need to produce enough to feed a growing population within environmental limits. In order to achieve this r
[normal]esearch must take a 
[normal]broad
[normal] perspective and 
[normal]fully address 
[normal]the environmental impacts as well as 
[normal]the agronomic.
[normal] 
[normal]Currently there is an issue that research is 
[normal]siloed
[normal] and as such fails to take account of the 
[normal]multifunctional nature of agriculture. 
[normal] 
[normal]Research should focus on 
[normal]sustainable production methods which address both farm
[normal], 
[normal]farming 
[normal]system and 
[normal]landscape
[normal] levels.
[normal] It is vital that the use of any technology does not lead to further narrowing of the range of crops grown: diversity is key to ensuring resilience in the face of unpredictable change.
[normal] 
[normal]4.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]With regard to GM technology there may be potential f
[normal]or GM crops which contribute to a more sustainable agricultural system however this has not been the focus of developments to date, indeed the predominant GM crops are those which facilitate the use of agr
[normal]o
[normal]chemicals 
[normal]which can damage soil 
[normal]and do not encoura
[normal]ge integrated pest control. In 
[normal]developing and implementing new research
[normal] the following
[normal] considerations should be taken into account:
[normal]4.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There is a need to improve the dissemination of research 
[normal]findings through effective knowledge transfer systems to ensure that reaches farmers and to allow them to adapt their farming systems accordingly.
[normal]5.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The horsemeat scandal at the start of this year highlighted 
[normal]both 
[normal]the importan
[normal]ce
[normal] of t
[normal]ransparen
[normal]cy within 
[normal]supply cha
[normal]ins, 
[normal]and the need for effective oversight. The ability to trace the provenance of food is key 
[normal]both to 
[normal]maintain
[normal]ing
[normal] consumer trust
[normal] and u
[normal]nderstand
[normal]ing
[normal] the environmental impact of a product
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Shorter more 
[normal]transparent food
[normal] chain
[normal]s are
[normal] essential 
[normal]to 
[normal]develop a better understanding of where the money goes within the food system for a range of products
[normal] as discussed above
[normal]. 
[normal]Shorter supply chains would 
[normal]help enhance traceability and build trust, but also to allow environmentally friendly farming to be supported via more direct connections to markets.
[normal]5.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A better understanding of the true costs of production can help improve resilience in its broadest sense, 
[normal]through a better understanding of the weaknesses in the system. 
[normal]A more detailed exploration of the importance of resilience is given below.
[normal]6.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In the UK clim
[normal]ate change is predicted to result in 
[normal]increased temperatures and increased rainfall extremes, however it is not clear what this will mean for crop yields
[normal]. I
[normal]t is 
[normal]expected 
[normal]that 
[normal]the 
[normal]UK 
[normal]will
[normal] remain food secure over the next 40 years
[normal]. 
[normal]Building resilience 
[normal]in
[normal]to the farming sector will be an important strategy to minimise both economic and output losses 
[normal]due to extreme weather events
[normal]. 
[normal]6.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]here is no consensus
[normal] on a definition of resilience
[normal] – the ability to absorb shock and, in some definitions the ability to change
[normal] or reorganise as a response to such a shock
[normal] is often cited
[normal]. 
[normal]It 
[normal]has been described
[normal] as the ability of social-ecological system
[normal]s,
[normal] both to withstand perturbations from
[normal],
[normal] for instance
[normal],
[normal] climate or economic shocks
[normal],
[normal] and to rebuild and renew itself afterwards. Loss
[normal] of resilience can cause loss of valuable ecosystem services
[normal].
[normal]6.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Society and institutions often find it difficult to shift to more resilient models
[normal]. The
[normal]re are many reasons for this
[normal]. T
[normal]he fact we work in hierarchies and silos
[normal] 
[normal]may make 
[normal]it difficult to understand the interconnections 
[normal]and potential benefits of different approaches.
[normal]  
[normal]In agriculture, t
[normal]he 
[normal]use of monocultures where diversity is denied in the pursuit of economies of scale 
[normal]can make change difficult
[normal]. 
[normal]Another reason is the attract
[normal]ion 
[normal]of focusing
[normal] on efficiency and 
[normal]short term profit maximisation, this increases 
[normal]the risk that economic models quickly buckle when stress is applied.
[normal] Finally a failure
[normal] to invest in appropriate infrastructure to underpin more resilient models
[normal] can present a
[normal]n
[normal] obstacle
[normal]. 
[normal]6.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In order to overcome these issues we need to 
[normal]accept 
[normal]the complexity of systems and rather than seek to oversimplify them
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]better recognise the multiple benefits which are 
[normal]delivered by 
[normal]such 
[normal]systems
[normal],
[normal]  e.g. sustaining 
[normal]bio
[normal]diversity, living within ec
[normal]ological boundaries
[normal] and 
[normal] generating social capital. 
[normal]6.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]For example 
[normal]UK agriculture’s 
[normal]increasing specialisation into specific farming types, contraction of crop rotations, increased stocking density and reduction of genetic diversity have all had profound envi
[normal]ronmental impacts. They have also made the system more brittle in that
[normal]:
[normal] 
[normal]6.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]One approach to address these problems is to look for down
[normal]-
[normal]stream fixes 
[normal]eg
[normal] 
[normal]build
[normal]ing new
[normal] reservoirs and develop new pesticides and drugs. While 
[normal]such actions can be useful
[normal],
[normal] a more cost effective approach may
[normal] 
[normal]be to seek to 
[normal]address the fundamental risk of failure which could have devastating consequences in a highly specialised agricultural syst
[normal]em.
[normal] B
[normal]uilding resilience through seeking alternative environmentally sustainable approaches
[normal],
[normal] such as by
[normal] extending crop rotations, us
[normal]ing integrated pest management and 
[normal]introducing traditional bre
[normal]eds less reliant on inputs although more complex, 
[normal]can 
[normal]deliver a
[normal] wider range of beneficial outcomes and reduce the potential impacts of extreme weather events
[normal].
[normal]6.7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Investment in ever more efficient approaches without a proper assessment of alternative approaches can result in 
[normal]sector
[normal] becoming ‘locked in’ to unsustainable a
[normal]pproaches and therefore being unable to deliver a broader range of benefit to society.
[normal]7.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In the short term in the UK w
[normal]e don’t need to increa
[normal]se production
[normal],
[normal] we need to make it more sustainable
[normal] – environmentally, economically and socially
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Simply pursuing increased production does not necessarily result in increased profit and is not good for farmers, society or the environment
[normal]. 
[normal]What is vital is creating value - for society and for farm businesses 
[normal]- 
[normal]in sustainable ways. 
[normal]Food is not the only output from our agricultural 
[normal]system;
[normal] 
[normal]there are a
[normal] range of other services that matter to us all, such as water quality, carbon storage, flood a
[normal]lleviation, the landscape, recreation,
[normal] employment, high
[normal] animal welfare and wildlife
[normal] habitats
[normal]. But the market often fails to 
[normal]distinguish between those 
[normal]providing these wider benefits to society, 
[normal]and those who are not. Often farmers seeking to be more sustain
[normal]able are unable 
[normal]t
[normal]o
[normal] compete with those farming in a less sustainable way.
[normal]7.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]£
[normal]3bn 
[normal]public funding for 
[normal]UK 
[normal]agriculture via t
[normal]he Common Agricultural Policy should be 
[normal]supporting farmers to become more sustainable and rewarding them for the wider public goods the
[normal]y produce
[normal]. But only a tiny proportion of this expenditure represents good value for the public purse by being targeted to sustainable farmers. 
[normal]7.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Increasing agricultural specialisation, driven by a narrow focus on efficiency
[normal],
[normal] has resulted in polarisation 
[normal]of production and the loss of mixed, rotational farming that has underpinned good soil, crop and animal husbandry for centuries. Historically farms 
[normal]utilised
[normal] rotations which build soil and circulate nutrients. 
[normal]Mixed farms
[normal] now find it difficult to compete wi
[normal]th the extremely specialised arable and livestock systems as the benefits of mixed systems and the externalities (soil degradation, feed and nutrient imports) of intensive systems
[normal],
[normal] are not reflected in our current economic model
[normal]. This specialisation, conc
[normal]entration on just a few major commodity crops and reliance on imported protein (the EU is already reliant on importing three-quarters of protein-rich feed) has left limited diversity, which combined with increasingly unpredictable extremes of weather, leav
[normal]es food production vulnerable and lacking resilience.
[normal]7.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Understanding and encouraging such complexity in 
[normal]the 
[normal]farming 
[normal]sector 
[normal]relies on skilled advisors. Too often the provision of advice is now left to those with vested interests and narrow specialities. 
[normal]In o
[normal]rder to support the shift to a more sustainable agricultural system a well informed, impartial advisory network is required.
[normal]  
[normal]7.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This shift 
[normal]should 
[normal]be underpinned by the infrastructure required for mixed, sustainable agriculture systems such as more small and
[normal] medium sized abattoirs, to enable shorter chains and trustworthy traceability.
[normal]8.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Within this submission we have referred to a number of 
[normal]actions
[normal] we believe are requ
[normal]ired to support a thriving UK agricultural system. 
[normal]These 
[normal]include better direction of support payments, investment in skills
[normal],
[normal] training 
[normal]and advisory support 
[normal]to better equip the industry 
[normal]to pursue 
[normal]a more sustainable approach and investment in infrastructure
[normal] to underpin this shift. 
[normal]8.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A change in peoples eating habits to more sustainable diets as described above would also improve our self sufficiency. 
[normal]However reducing use of cereals and oilseeds in animal feed through less intensive livestock farming could mak
[normal]e
[normal] the UK
[normal] more self-sufficient in these crops and would reduce reliance on imported protein. More sustainable diets would also benefit UK horticulture
[normal] through increased demand for vegetables
[normal].
