"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Flyingbinary [OD18]&#xa0;1. Why is open data important? &#xa0;\nOpen Data supports the development of digital businesses such as my own. Open Data’s real value is as a means of creating context for the work that we do as a business. We are a web science company who specialise in \nempowering businesses, governments and citizens to drive the value for data, open data is a vital component of this work and has been since we started the company four years ago. We have evidenced key issues across the world to create change invariably inc\norporating Open Data. This work has been showcased in the Guardian and has engaged audiences across the world, the largest audience for a single project was 34 million people.\n&#xa0;\n2. Why does the Government need an open data strategy? &#xa0;\nOur digital future as \na company is \ndependant\n on our ability to source data from many places and deliver insight, but more importantly predict likely patterns or outcomes. We are a UK company and although we work globally we strive to deliver at least 50% of the value of data we\n process, analyse and publish for the benefit of UK economy.\n&#xa0;\nThe Government Digital Service has a similar ambition to \nFlyingBinary\n, to deliver  a service for our clients that is “Digital by Default”. The roadmap we create at \nFlyingBinary\n for this work is \ndependant\n on data. The context of this work is set by the meta data available as Open Data. Incredibly even after many years of huge efforts by Cabinet Office some of this data is still under lock and key. Which makes the work that we could do and the inno\nvation we can bring limited by the Open Data available. It is this tragedy which prompted me to work as a member of the Open Data User Group last year and to continue with this ODUG work for a second year as there is still so much to do. As an SME this is \nreal overhead for my company to do this work without any form of payment, however it is important that data entrepreneurs like myself are able to input real world experience into this process. \n&#xa0;\n3. What should the Government’s aims be for the release of open data? a. Are the Government’s stated key outcomes in its Open Data Strategy the right ones? &#xa0;\nThe Open Data Strategy and the Shakespeare review and response are vital to move the Open Data agenda forward. However the delivery of this agenda is still \ndependent on Cabinet Office being adequately supported by both the Department for Business Innovation and Skills and HM Treasury. Fundamentally the collaboration and willingness \nof these key players to move to new business approaches and models will determ\nine the success of the Open Data agenda. \n&#xa0;\n4. \nHow can those engaged in open data, and those engaged in producing government statistics work together effectively to produce new data? &#xa0;\nMaking data available to web users be they citizens or communities in \nan interactive evidenced way is a skill set some data entrepreneurs have and government does not. We have as part of our outreach work run free workshops for over 170 advanced analysts within government to explain data innovations which make the most diffe\nrence in this arena. We believe that data is a language which traditionally trained staff find difficult to communicate and need retraining to do well. This will require a collaborative approach between government and data entrepreneurs and as yet has no m\neans of being delivered.\n&#xa0;\n5. How can more statistics and administrative data of all kinds become more freely available? &#xa0;\nThis will depend on the success of the NII approach and the ability of data.gov.uk to facilitate this data. It is hoped that \nDepartments will back this initiative by \ncurating\n their entries on the platform to allow all data to be declared. It will then depend on the ability of the platform to facilitate and engagement and evidencing model to ensure that data can be prioritised an\nd scheduled for release. ODUG paved the way for this innovative approach which it is hoped can be continued for NII. \n&#xa0;\n6. Is open data presented well and of adequate quality? &#xa0;a. Are the formats of the data being published accessible, useable and understandable to the public? &#xa0;\nI can best evidence this by referencing an example. As part of my work on ODUG in collaboration with the data.gov.uk team we developed a new Open Data model, demand led Open Data. This was built into the data.gov.uk platform and e\nvidenced the Open Data requirements of the data community. We have had over 5,000 interactions with the new functionality. Over 550 requests in 9 months which evidenced the barriers to Open Data and supports Sir Tim \nBerners\n Lee’s call for raw data. The Ope\nn Data barriers evidenced in the main are cost, licensing and unreliability of releases. Raw, incomplete and unclean data is not see as a barrier to Open Data by the community.\n&#xa0;\nHere is a link to the \nODUG\n \nRoadmap\n which evidences Demand Led Open Data.  I have also produced evidenced roadmaps for the departmental supply side but these have not been taken up by and pub\nlished by Cabinet Office. The new publish by default mechanism appears to be the favoured route for this capability. \n&#xa0;\nAs a member of ODUG I will be asking for NII to be evidenced in the same way. We as a company can do this work however we will not be und\nertaking this without payment as we did for the ODUG facilities, which may result in this evidencing not being done. \n&#xa0;\nb. What metadata is needed to make releases useful? &#xa0;\nMeta data is the key to releasing Open Data a minimum set of meta data is better th\nan none at all. This is an area of government Open Data which is very poorly done, however data companies like ourselves can start innovations with minimal meta data.\n&#xa0;\nc. Who will use the data released? &#xa0;\nOne particular example is from a Tech City company \nI mentor who have requested DEFRA data via ODUG to enable them to challenge the CAP levy paid by the UK which is due to be renegotiated in 2014. The resultant analysis they produce could be of huge benefit to UK PLC. This data has not yet been released by \nDEFRA although ODUG are attempting to get this data released as soon as possible.  \n&#xa0;\nAs G-Cloud suppliers we have built mapping products which would enable us to track the transition / reorganisation of government departments, for example the old and the n\new NHS organisation. Due the price of the PAF and the restrictions on the use of OS data it is a prohibitive cost for us to extend the capabilities of our current mapping products. If this the case for our company this is the case for any other. Additional\nly a free PAF for micros SMEs is no help. It can take months to bring a product like this to market and there is no guarantee on future prices of PAF data once Royal Mail is in private sector hands. Therefore this is not an offer worth the risk. Additional\nly it appears that SME data companies who have raised funds to buy PAF will not benefit from this offer. \n&#xa0;\nFor more information it should be noted that every request for a data set evidenced by ODUG gives detailed information from the requester on the use \nthey will make from the data. The examples submitted are many and varied from a large number of requesters the majority private individuals, SMEs and \nStartups\n.\n&#xa0;7. How successful has the Government’s Open Data initiative been in changing behaviour in the Civil Service and wider public sector? \n&#xa0;\nDespite all the great work which has been done by Cabinet Office there is still a genuine reluctance to embrace the Open Data agenda. My company supplies cloud and data services on all 4 G-Cloud lots and has been aw\narded all 3 G-Cloud frameworks. We find as part of our G-Cloud work data literacy is very low across the Civil Service. In contrast the ODUG Roadmap which visualises the evidence for demand led Open Data has been very well received and is even being used b\ny in Government Departments to inform them on the priorities for their Open Data strategies. Without more tools like the ODUG Roadmap it will prove difficult to educate and inform the Civil Service at large and create a culture change which affects behavio\nur in general.  \n&#xa0;\n8. Which datasets are the most important? \n&#xa0;\nThis is my 3 year as a mentor to our companies in Tech City where I specialise in advising on growth, particularly for those companies electing to “bootstrap” growth rather than seek investment\n. Despite the great work of ODUG in the first year we have been unable to unlock key datasets such as the Postal Address File owned by Royal Mail and data held by the Ordnance Survey. These data sets are key for ourselves and our Digital data companies to \ndevelop innovations and products for the benefit of UK Plc. \n&#xa0;\na. What are the best examples of data being made open and resultant benefits to business or society? &#xa0;\nThe Price Paid dataset released by the Land Registry was a priority request from the deman\nd led ODUG Open Data innovation facilities on data.gov.uk. This Open Data is being worked on by a number of companies and I expect this to generate a number of innovations by companies large and small in the housing market.\n&#xa0;\n9. How effective is the work being undertaken by the Cabinet Office to monitor the progress of Departments in publishing their agreed datasets? &#xa0;\nI have also  produced evidenced roadmaps for the Departmental supply side but these have not been taken up by and published by Cabinet Offi\nce. The new publish by default mechanism appears to be the favoured route for this capability. \n&#xa0;\nAs a member of ODUG I will be asking for NII to be evidenced in the same way. We as a company can do this work however we will not be undertaking this without \npayment as we did for the ODUG facilities, which may result in this evidencing not being done. \n&#xa0;\nJacqui Taylor\nFounder, CEO\nFlyingBinary\n \nLtd\nm: +44 77 899 668 02\ne: \njacqui.taylor@flyingbinary.com\nt: \n@\nflyingbinary\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
