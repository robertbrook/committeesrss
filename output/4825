[normal]Written Evidence 
[normal]from the 
[normal]Police and Crime Commissioner 
[normal]for 
[normal]Cumbria
[normal] [CST0055]
[normal]Summary: 
[normal]This submission responds to the 2 
[normal]areas of interest raised in the Chairman’s letter of 6
[normal]th
[normal] December. It covers how I, as Police and Crime Commissioner, gain assurance about the accuracy of crime figures in Cumbria
[normal] and
[normal] 
[normal]the range of methods I use to
[normal] monitor performance. 
[normal] 
[normal]As
[normal] Police and Crime
[normal] Commissioner, I am acutely aware of the importance of t
[normal]he public having 
[normal]confidence i
[normal]n the information provided to them about crime in their area. 
[normal]Accurate crime data is also vital for planning the best use of resources.  
[normal]This is not unique to Cumbria and
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]indeed, 
[normal]this issue has
[normal] attracted interest nationally.
[normal] T
[normal]his is why I decided that it would only be appropriate to check on the quality and accuracy of data recording by Cumbria Constabulary. 
[normal]Th
[normal]e approach
[normal] has included using our internal audit function to carry out a check of data quality and continued monitoring of Constabulary work and action plans to 
[normal]ensure a high level of
[normal] data recording accuracy
[normal] 
[normal]following changes to the internal crime and incident recor
[normal]ding checking function
[normal]. 
[normal]There is an on-going programme of independent checks in place, both through us
[normal]e of audit and HMIC inspections, whose findings will inform my areas of focus with the Constabulary. 
[normal] 
[normal]We know that official recorded crime figures only r
[normal]epresent a proportion of the crime experienced by the public in Cumbria
[normal] and we need to be clear for the public that we are talking about 
[normal]recorded
[normal] crime
[normal]. 
[normal]There are a variety of reasons why victims may choose not to report a crime to the police, however impr
[normal]oving the victim’
[normal]s experience and 
[normal]providing a range of pathways for reporting crime are priorities for me
[normal],
[normal] to ensure that more victims come forward and can receive 
[normal]support if they require it.
[normal] 
[normal]Indeed, increasing reporting of domestic abuse and hate crimes a
[normal]re priorities within my Police and Crime Plan and the measure
[normal]s
[normal] used to monitor performance in these area
[normal]s
[normal] reflect this.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]My Police and Crime Plan, ‘Making Cumbria an Even Safer Place’ sets out my priorities for the Constabulary and 
[normal]it therefore
[normal] forms the cornerstone of holding the Chief Constable to account for performance of his force. I have in place a number of performance measures
[normal], which include
[normal] priority crime types, to enable me and, indeed the Police and Crime Panel and the public, to keep
[normal] track of the Plan and crime levels in the county. 
[normal]My regular engagement with 
[normal]District Councils often focusses on the level of crime in their area and so this crime and other data also provides information of use to local Councils. 
[normal]These 
[normal]measures f
[normal]orm par
[normal]t of a number of methods through which I monitor police performance. 
[normal]They
[normal] include feedback from the public on quality of service, such as via my engagement events, correspondence and surveys. I also receive reports from the Constabulary at my Executive Boa
[normal]rd on other aspects of value for money, such as sickness, overtime costs
[normal] and
[normal] complaints and
[normal] the Constabulary provides
[normal] bi-monthly updates on priority theme
[normal]s
[normal] in the Police and Crime Plan, such as road safety 
[normal]or
[normal] use of out of court disposals. Internal audits 
[normal]allow me to gain assurance on the robustness of internal controls and data quality. 
[normal]Overall, th
[normal]is approach aims to provide and drive a balanced and rounded picture of performance 
[normal]without over-
[normal]emphasis on meeting targets.
[normal] 
[normal]As an issue of continued national i
[normal]nterest, I 
[normal]would
[normal] welcome 
[normal]further proposals 
[normal]national
[normal]ly
[normal] to continue to promote accuracy of crime data
[normal]. I will also 
[normal]look forward to the findings of your inquiry.
