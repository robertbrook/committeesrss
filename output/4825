defaultWritten Evidence 
defaultfrom the 
defaultPolice and Crime Commissioner 
defaultfor 
defaultCumbria
default [CST0055]
defaultSummary: 
defaultThis submission responds to the 2 
defaultareas of interest raised in the Chairman’s letter of 6
defaultth
default December. It covers how I, as Police and Crime Commissioner, gain assurance about the accuracy of crime figures in Cumbria
default and
default 
defaultthe range of methods I use to
default monitor performance. 
default 
defaultAs
default Police and Crime
default Commissioner, I am acutely aware of the importance of t
defaulthe public having 
defaultconfidence i
defaultn the information provided to them about crime in their area. 
defaultAccurate crime data is also vital for planning the best use of resources.  
defaultThis is not unique to Cumbria and
default,
default 
defaultindeed, 
defaultthis issue has
default attracted interest nationally.
default T
defaulthis is why I decided that it would only be appropriate to check on the quality and accuracy of data recording by Cumbria Constabulary. 
defaultTh
defaulte approach
default has included using our internal audit function to carry out a check of data quality and continued monitoring of Constabulary work and action plans to 
defaultensure a high level of
default data recording accuracy
default 
defaultfollowing changes to the internal crime and incident recor
defaultding checking function
default. 
defaultThere is an on-going programme of independent checks in place, both through us
defaulte of audit and HMIC inspections, whose findings will inform my areas of focus with the Constabulary. 
default 
defaultWe know that official recorded crime figures only r
defaultepresent a proportion of the crime experienced by the public in Cumbria
default and we need to be clear for the public that we are talking about 
defaultrecorded
default crime
default. 
defaultThere are a variety of reasons why victims may choose not to report a crime to the police, however impr
defaultoving the victim’
defaults experience and 
defaultproviding a range of pathways for reporting crime are priorities for me
default,
default to ensure that more victims come forward and can receive 
defaultsupport if they require it.
default 
defaultIndeed, increasing reporting of domestic abuse and hate crimes a
defaultre priorities within my Police and Crime Plan and the measure
defaults
default used to monitor performance in these area
defaults
default reflect this.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultMy Police and Crime Plan, ‘Making Cumbria an Even Safer Place’ sets out my priorities for the Constabulary and 
defaultit therefore
default forms the cornerstone of holding the Chief Constable to account for performance of his force. I have in place a number of performance measures
default, which include
default priority crime types, to enable me and, indeed the Police and Crime Panel and the public, to keep
default track of the Plan and crime levels in the county. 
defaultMy regular engagement with 
defaultDistrict Councils often focusses on the level of crime in their area and so this crime and other data also provides information of use to local Councils. 
defaultThese 
defaultmeasures f
defaultorm par
defaultt of a number of methods through which I monitor police performance. 
defaultThey
default include feedback from the public on quality of service, such as via my engagement events, correspondence and surveys. I also receive reports from the Constabulary at my Executive Boa
defaultrd on other aspects of value for money, such as sickness, overtime costs
default and
default complaints and
default the Constabulary provides
default bi-monthly updates on priority theme
defaults
default in the Police and Crime Plan, such as road safety 
defaultor
default use of out of court disposals. Internal audits 
defaultallow me to gain assurance on the robustness of internal controls and data quality. 
defaultOverall, th
defaultis approach aims to provide and drive a balanced and rounded picture of performance 
defaultwithout over-
defaultemphasis on meeting targets.
default 
defaultAs an issue of continued national i
defaultnterest, I 
defaultwould
default welcome 
defaultfurther proposals 
defaultnational
defaultly
default to continue to promote accuracy of crime data
default. I will also 
defaultlook forward to the findings of your inquiry.
