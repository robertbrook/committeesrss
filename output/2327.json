"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by British Sky Broadcasting Limited (‘Sky’) [WAS0036]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSky welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Committee’s inquiry on \nWomen and Sport\n.\n \nAs the Committee highlights t\nhere are \na \nnumber\n of \nfactors that \ninfluence\n levels of participation in women’\ns\n sport \nranging from awareness to\n access\n. F\nor the pu\nrposes of this response we \nhave \nlimit\ned\n our comments to our \nareas of experience\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs a subscription\n&#xa0;\nbroadcaster in over 11 million UK home\ns we understand the importance\n&#xa0;\nof\n&#xa0;\nproviding a service that caters for\n&#xa0;\nall our customers’ interests. In\n&#xa0;\ndepth and comp\nrehensive\n&#xa0;\ncoverage of all sport\n&#xa0;\nhas been a key part of that\n&#xa0;\noffering for over 20 years and\n&#xa0;\nwomen’s\n&#xa0;\nsport is an integral part of our sports\n&#xa0;\noffering.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe also understand that c\noverage \nof female \nsport\ning events\n \nhas \na \nvaluable \nrole to p\nlay in \nraising \nawareness and \nframing perceptions of women in \nsport\n.\n \nSky’s\n \n6 \nSports and Sports News channels\n are watched by 6 million women per month and provide\n an effective platf\norm for women’s sport, creating\n \nopportunities to showcase sports \nand reach \nnew \nfans and \nparticipants\n.\n \nW\ne \na\nlso\n \nbelieve that \nwe can \ninspir\ne engagement by women by\n showing all sport (\nmen’s, women’s and mixed) in \nexciting and relev\nant format\ns\n that \nare\n inclusive and appealing\n to all\n.\n This includes \nhaving women presenters, reporters and athletes \ntelling the story\n,\n re\ninforcing the perception of \nsport\n \nas\n a\n mainstream interest for women as well as\n men\n. \n&#xa0;\n1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe ability of s\nports \nbodies \nto invest \nin their sport \nand \nopportunities for women to access sport\n, both\n at elite and grass-root level \nalso a play\n role in influencing levels of \nfemale participation\n. \nSky has been one of the leading investors in sport\n for over two decades\n \nnot only through \nthe \ninve\nstment \nwe make in acquiring \nrights\n and airtime\n every year\n but through \npromotion \nand \npartnership\n with \nsports \ngoverning bodies\n, \nas well \nas \nthe creation of\n our own initiatives to encourage\n \nparticipation\n and support athletes\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n1.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo that end \nour approach \nto women and sport \nencompasses not just \nshow\ning\n women’s sport but \nshowing all \nsport \nin a\n \nuniversally appealing way\n, as well as supporting women in sport, investing in the future of women’s sport and encouraging more women an\nd girls to get involved.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTelevision\n \nprovides\n a\n powerful\n \nmeans of showcasing and \nstimulating \ninterest in sport. \nB\neyond \ncoverage of the sport itself\n,\n \nsports programming\n is able to\n \nprovide a wealth of \nin\n-\ndepth \nanalysis and commentary that draws the viewer \nin and grows\n their understanding and connection\n with a sport\n. \nThis in turn can \nbecome\n \na catalyst \nfor participation, \ninspiring\n \nambitions\n \nto emulate \nsporting heroes\n or \nsimply \nencouraging \njoin\ning\n in for fun\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs part of our wide-ranging sports offering \nSky Sports \nshow\ns\n an extensive amount and variety \nof women’s sports programming\n,\n c\nonsisting\n of\n a rich mixt\nure\n of\n \nlive sport\n, \nhighlights, support shows\n and news\n.\n \n \nAs part of our schedule we show women’s sport every month\n, so\n far this year that has included\n \ncoverage across \nmore than \n200 days\n. T\nhis \nairtime \nprovides a valuable \nshowcas\ne for \na wide variety of \nwomen’s \nsport\n  and has included\n:\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis is in addition to the news and results reports we carry on a regular basis. As Europe’s leading 24 hour sports news service, Sky Sports News will as a matter of course carry results of women’s matches. Where editorially appropriate the Sky News team a\nlso cover news stories around women’s sport and sportspeople. For example, following on from their \nvictory\n in the Ashes\n,\n Sky Sports News intervie\nwed members of the team on set\n about how their success can be built on at a grass roots level. Similarly in the\n last year Sky Sports News’ half hour documentary series, Special Report, has included profiles of \nCaroline Wozniacki\n, Petra Kvitova, Katie Taylor, Chemmy Alcott, Jess Ennis-Hill, Perri Shakes-Drayton, Christine Ohuruogu, Equality Games, Paula Radcliffe an\nd the marathon. \n&#xa0;\n2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n  As part of International Women’s Day Sky Sports News also committed to a week of coverage on women’s sport. Programming included a live debate with Judy Murray and Laura Trott, an extensive number of interviews with sportswomen includin\ng Gail Emms and Karen Brown \nas well as the \nChair of \nthe Youth Sport Trust, \nBaroness Sue Campbell.\n \nSky Sports News \nwill \nalso \nshortly be launching \nSportswomen,\n \na new\n weekly half hour magazine programme dedicated to \ncoverage of women in the sporting arena\n. It \nwill \nprovide a round-up of the latest news and results, \nexplore key\n sporting issues from a female perspective and include inspirational sporting women as studio guests.\n The first show will feature former England football manager, Hope Powell and as pa\nrt of ‘My Life in Sport’,\n a regular\n \nfeature \nprofiling women wo\nrking \nin sport, \n viewers will be able to \ngo\n \nbehind the scenes\n \nwith\n the \nEngland netball team as they prepare for their International Test Series against South Africa\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, \nwhilst it\n i\ns important that women’s sport is \nappropriately \nrepresented in \nprogramming\n, sports coverage\n does\n \nn\no\nt have \nexclusively \nto \ninvolve\n women to engage and inspire\n them\n. We know this because o\nur female viewers also enjoy coverage of m\nen’s sports\n, for example the \nManch\nester United v Chelsea Premier L\neague match\n on 26\nth\n August\n saw an average audien\nce of roughly 2.6m of which 800,000\n were female. \n[\nBARB/Techedge (Based on Match audience)]\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHaving \nfemale presenters and sportswomen \nas part of the team \ntell\ning\n the story is an important aspect in making all sport relevant and more engaging to \nfemale \nviewers.\n Seeing \nknowledgeable \nwomen presenting and commenting on all types of sport sends a positive message that sport is very much a \nmainstream \ninterest and pursuit for women. \n \nAs a broadcaster, i\nt also makes sense to \nuse the best talent\n a\nble to talk expertly and passionately about sport.\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFemale reporters, presenters and production staff have been \nkey \nmembers of the Sky Sports team\n for\n over \n20 year\ns\n. \nR\ne\nporters and presenters such as Vicky Gomersall, Natalie Sawyer, Alex Hammond, Anna Woolhouse and Orla Chen\nnaoui \ncover \na range of \nfemale and male\n sport\ns\n and \nprovide \nin-\ndepth knowledge and expertise\n.\n For example\n \nOrla Chennaoui \npresented our male and female Olympics coverage last year and \nwill be heading up our coverage of\n \nthe men’s and \nwomen’s cycling \nWorld Road Racing Championships \nlater this month\n.\n \n \nThis approach is also reflected \non \nSky Sports \nwhere \nNatalie Pinkham \nis a \ncentral\n member of the F1 team,\n whilst\n Sarah\n-\nJane Mee \nappears on \nCricket AM\n, \nSaturday Night Football\n and Sky News,\n and\n Hayley McQueen is part of the C\nhampions League\n team\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nW\nomen \nalso \noccupy \nseveral \nsenior production roles \nat Sky Sports News\n.\n \nFor example, \nKaren Will\nmington\n, \nis head of studio output and has been studio director for \nSoccer Saturday\n for more than 15 years, \nMel\nissa\n Bartlett, \nis a Senior \nDirector\n,\n and Helen Kemp, is the Resources and Facilities M\nanager, in charge of camera crews, satellite \ntrucks and regional bureaus.\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSky Sports coverage also includes contributions from female experts, \non both women and men’s sports, \nfor example \nw\nomen rugby players are frequently invited to disc\nuss women’s rugby matches and \nMaggie Alphonsie\n has been a guest on The Rugby Club discussing the Game. \n \nCharlotte Edwards \nalso \nrecently \nappeared as a guest expert with David Gower during the third men’s Ashes Test in August 2013.\n \n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSports \nbodies’ \nability \nto \nfoster \ntalent\n, develop training infrastructure, \npro\nvide\n opportunities to participate \nand promote themselves \nis also essential to attracting more women\n into sport. \nW\ne believe that \npartnerships between broadcasters and sporting bodies \nprovide\n \nthe opportunity for a much deeper \nsupportive \nrelationship\n \naffording\n \nnot just \nthe \nopportunity to grow sports\n using \nfunding derived\n from sports rights, bu\nt working together to promote \na \nsport\n.\n \n \nWhilst it is up to the governing bodies how they invest in their\n sports we believe that our commitment and support has resulted in \nreal benefits\n for \nboth \nwomen’s \nand men’s \nsport.\n \n \n&#xa0;\n4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor example our support for women’s \ncricket spans 16 years \nand \nencompasses\n more coverage than any\n other broadcaster\n. \nThe quality and volume of coverage \nhas given the sport a platform that had not previously existed, \nbringing it to \nthe attention \nof \nthe next generation of \nfemale cricketers\n. Our commitment to the sport \nmeans more than just \nbroadcasting the live sport. We al\nso spend time and effort \nworking to promote it\n,\n \nf\nor example in the \nbuild-up\n to the \nICC Women’s Cricket World Cup\n,\n Sky held a media day for the women’s team which resulted in a large amount of news coverage in both the front and back pages of the \nnational \npress. \n \n&#xa0;\n4.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSky’s commitment also \nencompass\nes\n support through partnership. \nIn October 2006, Sky Sports and the ECB teamed up to launch the Sky Sports ECB Coach Education Programme, a scheme building on the successes of the ECB’s previous coaching initiatives\n and designed to equip coaches with the necessary skills to deliver high quality coaching programmes at all levels of the game. Since the scheme began over 50,000 coaching certificates have been awarded and a large number of these have been awarded to fema\nle coaches, helping to create and inspire younger generations of female cricketers and coaches to take up the game.\n&#xa0;\n4.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSimilarly, o\nur \npartnership with British Cycling supports female\n as well as male elite cyclists\n and w\ne are immensely proud of \nthe exceptional progress made by \nthe Great Britain team and particularly the \nelite female riders, who since 2008 have won 10 medals across two \nOlympic \nGames\n, inspiring women across the UK to ride their bikes\n.\n \nWe also work closely with women’s golf and \nso f\nar this year \nwe have \nwork\ned\n with \na number of \nwomen golfers to build their profile and \npromote \nmajor tournaments\n such as the\n Kraft Nabisco Championship, the Solheim Cup and the Evian Championships\n, \nproviding greater \nexposure\n to the game\n. \n \n&#xa0;\n4.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMore directly, \nour S\nky Sports Scholarships scheme \nhelps\n \nyoung athletes\n realise their potential in competition and beyond. It\n offers assistance through financial support, media training and mentoring in order to help with the day to day realities \nof life\n as a professional \nathlete\n and will hopefully create sporting role models of the future.\n  \nIn August 2013 we announced the latest 12 scholarships which included 7 \nfemale athletes encompassing\n a diverse range of women’s sports\n and \nbackgrounds\n \nincluding\n \nSavan\nnah Marshall, \na boxer from Hartlepool, \nHolly Bleasdale, \na pole vaulter from Preston and \nElise Christie, a short-course \nice-sk\nater from Livingston\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSky \nSports \nhas also\n announced its commitment to\n the celebration of women\n in\n sport\n through our sponsorship of\n the Sunday Times Sportswomen o\nf the Year \nAwards.\n \nThe awards showcase\n \nthe outstanding contributions to sport \nmade \nby \nfemale \nathletes, coaches, administrators and community volunteers\n. O\nver the next few months\n Sky will \nbe h\nighlighting their achievements\n as \nwell as \nhost\ning\n and broadcast\ning\n \nthe\n awards ceremony in December\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur \nposition as a broadcaster enables\n us to inspire our customers\n \nto get involved\n in sport\n. \nWhile we do support \nsome\n initiatives \nspec\nifically fo\ncused \non women\n,\n our \nprimary \nfocus is \ngender neutral as we be\nlieve that exciting and appealing opportunities to participate\n or \nbe \ninspirational \nmentors have universal appeal\n and can be effective in encouraging more women \nand girls \nto participate in sport.\n \n&#xa0;\n5.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor example, \nSky Sports Living for Sport is a free UK secondary schools initiative that uses life-changing stories and expertise of athlete mentors to motivate and inspire young people. \n37\n \nof \nthe 74 \nmentors in the scheme are women\n, \nwith\n \nsportswomen \nsuch as\n Jess Ennis\n-\nH\nill\n \nand Katie Taylor \nrepresenting strong\n female role \nmodels\n. \n \nNevertheless, we are \nalso \nconscious that all the \ninspirational \nsportspeople\n \nwe work with have the ability to encourage \ngirls to take up sport\n, David Beckham being a case in point.\n \n&#xa0;\n5.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur partnership with British Cycling began in 2008 and included an ambition to inspire one million people to cycle more regularly. This objective was achieved in October 2012 of which 345,000 women have been inspired to cycle. \n&#xa0;\nThrough Sky Ride, our grassr\noots programme, we are creating routes and rides to attract more families into cycling through free mass participation cycling events and weekend rides. Our high profile Sky Ride ambassadors like Lorraine Kelly and Edith Bowman have helped us raise awarene\nss of the benefits for cycling for fun, fitness and health. \n&#xa0;\nPlus our support and promotion of the British Cycling stars like Laura Trott and Shanaze Reade has provided a catalyst for growth in cycling participation with 40% more women commuting since 2008\n and over 35% of the young people on our Go Ride Club partnership being girls. \n&#xa0;\n5.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe \nare proud to \nsupport Breeze, \nwhich is \nBritish Cycling’s volunteer-organised, led-ride programme that addresses the key barriers women face when considering cycling. Over 16\n,000 women have joined this network, reaching 200 local authorities across England. \nW\ne will continue to support British Cycling with their ambition to inspire one million more women to ride by 2020, improving cycling for women at every level, whether as a \nsport or recreational activity.\n&#xa0;\n5.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSky also carries programming which is aimed at encouraging \nwomen and girls’\n grassroots participation in sport. Two noteworthy examples include: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSeptember\n 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
