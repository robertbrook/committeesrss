defaultIn terms of impacts on Link we

default following:
default1)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIncreased rent arrearsdefault: 
defaultWe expect rent arrears to increase in the future due to the following:
default 
defaultLink’s current rent arrears remai
defaultn
default relatively
default steady with no significant increase caused by the introduction of the social size criteria
default. However
default this has only been achieved by significant investment in staff resources to support our affected tenants.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIncreased transaction costs: defaultAt th
defaulte current time
default,
default 61% of our tenants are on full or partial Housing Benefit, which incurs a negligible bank transaction cost. Under Universal Credit it is anticipated that approximately 80% of UC claimants will have their rent paid directly to them and will 
defaultthen pay this to Link. Assuming that every tenant paid their rent in a single payment each month this will equate to approximately 74,000 bank transactions per annum at an average cost of £0.50 per transaction. We are aware from the DPDP that tenants often
default make a number of smaller payments towards their rent each month as they juggle household budgets to meet other bills. The number of bank transactions and 
defaulttherefore the associated costs are likely to be higher than this. Link 
defaulthas had to increase the number
default of licences to allow staff to accept credit card payments and we expect that the number of required licences will increase further as the demand for this facility increases. There is a cost associated with each licence.

defaultPrivate Sector Leasing:defaultLink currently manages the largest Private Sector Leasing (PSL) scheme in Scotland on
default behalf of 
defaultthe 
defaultCity of Edinburgh Council and provides temporary accommodation for 1
default,
default750 tenants who are deemed to be in priority housing need.
defaultTenants housed in temporary accommodation often present with multiple vulnerabilities
default and may have chaotic lifestyles. It is likely that they will not have the ability to manage their finances to pay their rent themselves.  It is unreasonable to expect them to keep control of what rent they owe to which landlord and arrange these payments 
defaultonce their Universal Credit payment is received. 
defaultWhilst it is understood that consideration will be given by DWP to the tenant’s vulnerabilities in order to make payments of rent to the landlord, we are concerned that the processes and administration requ
defaultired to set these up will be onerous on housing staff. It is therefore recommend
defaulted
default that the default position for tenants in temporary (private or local authority) accommodation 
defaultis for them to
default have their rent paid directly to the landlord. 
defaultAs previously noted
default,
default tenants accessing temporary accommodation are often extremely vulnerable and may have chaotic lifestyles, thus facing considerable risks to their health and 
defaultwell-being if required to share. In order to be sustainable
default,
default the shared tenancies are also likely to require intensive housing management and support from an increased number of specialist staff. There are further concerns that the processes involved in ma
defaulttching individuals to share will result in delays in securing suitable accommodation and pose significant challenges for staff involved. 
defaultTemporary accommodation has to be flexible and reactive to homelessness needs
default. I
defaultf the size criteria restriction is applied, Link 
defaultis
default likely to be in a position where 
defaultwe are
default unable to house those presenting as homeless
default.
default 
defaultWe 
defaultwill also see an increase in void periods 
defaultas
default it would be unreasonable to place people in accommodation they will no
defaultt be able to afford due to shortfalls in benefit entitlement. It is not feasible to manage temporary accommodation in this way as the need for one
default-
defaultbedroom properties far outweighs their availability. This is likely to increase homelessness and potentially 
defaulta return to rough sleeping. It also increases the cost for the provider due to potential increase in void periods.
defaultA standard rate may not cover the actual costs of delivering the scheme so managing agents will
default withdraw from future provision. We believe that the management fee should be paid based on actual service delivery costs, which are scrutinised as part of the tendering process. The administration, claim processes and uncertainties over payment will pose 
defaultdifficulties for Link.   
defaultIn addition to the specific points raised, our expectation is that the cumulative impacts will likely result in an increase in 
defaultthe 
defaultcost of providing temporary accommodation due to the additional administration involved, the increa
defaultsed need for specialist housing staff, the shortage of suitable 
defaultaccommodation and the increase in void periods whilst tenants are matched and suitably-sized accommodation is sourced.
defaultIt is likely to increase the number of legal actions and evictions; due 
defaultto the increase in arrears it will limit future housing options or consideration for re
default-
defaultreferral to our service. This will lead to an increase in homelessness, more pressure on services, but with greater limitations on what can be offered.
default Also, given the 
defaultrelatively high rents in the scheme and the higher risk of non-payment of rent, landlords’ 
defaultcashflow
default problems may lead to bankruptcy and resultant further homelessness.
defaultLandlords have not been willing to accept lower rental offers for larger properties whic
defaulth would meet the benefit cap so we are left with no alternative but to hand them back, reducing the stock of properties suitable for large families.    
defaultAn example of how a tenant is currently affected by the benefit cap.default1 adult and 5 children in a 4 bedr
defaultoom property. The household income comprises Income Support £339.46 (includes amounts for the children) and Child Benefit £73.90.
defaultThe total income from benefit for this family is £701.81 per week which includes the Housing Benefit award of £288.46 weekly.
defaultAs the benefit cap amount is £500 weekly for this family, they will have to find £201.81 each week to contribute towards their rent.
defaultThis tenant is seeking employment of 16 hours per week paid at 
defaultthe 
defaultminimum wage of £6.19 per hour. She would then be entitl
defaulted to Working Tax Credit and child care costs of up to £339.87 per week. Child Tax Credits of £271.27 per week, Child Benefit of £73.90 and Housing Benefit of £261.51 per week.
defaultTotal benefit income is £946.55 which is £244.74 more than when solely in recei
defaultpt of benefit.
default 
defaultWhere are the savings?
defaultWhilst we appreciate the need to encourage people to access employment, it is likely that the pressure to find and sustain employment when a family is experiencing homelessness will place additional stress on the house
defaulthold. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn terms of impacts on tenants and in particular vulnerable groups we are concerned about the following.
