"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Greater London Authority (HOT33)&#xa0;\nPlease find attached with this letter the response of the Mayor of London to your call for evidence on heat policy. The Mayor takes the security, affordability and sustainability of London’s energy supply very seriously, seeing it as key pillar in London’s\n competitiveness and the economic well-being of Londoners. \n&#xa0;\nOur work on heat supply and demand reduction is at the forefront of UK cities and I commend to the committee the research and the programmes we have developed in London, referred to in this \nsubmission, particularly on the role of decentralised energy and heat networks as part of an efficient and integrated energy system. We have a productive working relationship with the Heat team at DECC, which has largely adopted our approach to urban heat \nsupply.\n&#xa0;\nHowever, we remain concerned that heat policy is not well integrated with wider energy policy in government. In our response we point out a range of inconsistencies that, without reform, are likely to lead to a less efficient and therefore more ex\npensive low carbon transition. \n&#xa0;\nThe Mayor welcomes the Committee’s scrutiny of this often over-looked area of energy policy and both I and my officers would be happy to discuss these issues further with you.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;1.1\n&#xa0; \nThe Mayor of London’s Climate Change Mitigation and Energy Strategy\n sets out the carbon and energy savings required to deliver a 60 per cent reduction in emissions and the generation of 25 per cent of London’s energy within London by 2025. As heat generation and usage is innately local (where as power generation can be re\nmote), the Mayor can have greater direct influence on the role of heat in London’s energy system. The Greater London Authority (GLA), on the Mayor’s behalf, has developed a detailed understanding of the opportunities for heat supply and demand reduction in\n London, in the context of government’s energy policies. This response addresses issues pertinent to London. Key points are summarised below – \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n2.1\n&#xa0; \nThe Mayor of London’s ambitions for London’s energy infrastructure and market development are commensurate with government’s over-arching energy policies. They must ensure energy security and facilitate an afforda\nble transition to a low carbon economy. The Mayor views the delivery of these ambitions as a key pillar of London’s long-term competitiveness as a world city and its ability to maintain and grow its vital contribution to the UK economy. \n&#xa0;\n2.2\n&#xa0; \nThe Mayor welcome\ns DECC’s Heat Strategy, in particular the long-overdue attention it gives to the role of decentralised energy and district heating in the provision of secure, affordable, low carbon heat in cities. However, he is of the view that insufficient consideration\n has yet been given to the integration of heat within a comprehensive strategy for the development of the UK energy system. \n&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0; \nOverall system efficiency, market access and flexibility should be additional guiding principles for the development of that syste\nm, allowing a more dynamic account of carbon, capacity and cost in supply and demand decisions. As the range and integration potential of energy vectors increases, alongside the ability to manage demand and supply more actively, cities have a crucial contr\nibution to make to overall system efficiency and therefore to the affordability of the low carbon transition. The current regulatory and fiscal support regimes give inconsistent support to the technologies and services at the full range of scales that coul\nd deliver this. \n&#xa0;\n2.4\n&#xa0; \nWe would argue that district scale generation, low carbon (\nas well as\n Renewable) energy sources and technologies, district heating, demand-side management, thermal storage and market access for distribution scale market actors are all und\ner-accounted for in the current and emerging regimes; yet these are all crucial components of the contribution that cities, given their energy demand density, can make to an efficient low carbon transition. \n&#xa0;\n2.5\n&#xa0; \nThe Mayor commends to the Committee systems mod\nelling and demonstration projects such as the Urban Energy Systems project at Imperial College and the Energy Technology Institute’s Smart Systems and Heat programme. He also welcomes DECC’s Heat Networks Delivery Unit (HNDU). The intended outputs of these\n programmes are consistent with the research, strategy and programmes we have been developing in London. Recent independent research for the GLA which should be of interest to the Committee includes:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.6\n&#xa0; \nThis research and other GLA led activity referred to in the text below is available here: \nhttp://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/environment/tackling-climate-chan\nge/energy-supply\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n&#xa0; \nLondon’s heat demand density is such that, under scenarios that rebalance the inconsistent regime of support identified above, 27 per cent of London’s energy should be generated and di\nstributed within the city by 2030 (\nDecentralised Energy Capacity Study\n – see link above), providing secure, low carbon and affordable heat and power and decreasing London’s reliance on investment in upstream generation. The majority of this contribution (2\n2 per cent) will involve the deployment of heat networks and will utilise a range of low to zero carbon fuels and energy sources. With respect to heat, these include: waste, biomass, secondary (process and environmental) heat and gas. \n&#xa0;\n3.2\n&#xa0; \nOur most recent ind\nependent research finds that up to 38% (about 25TWh/annum) of London’s total heat demand could eventually be met economically from secondary, low grade heat sources when upgraded and distributed via heat networks (\nSecondary Heat\n study – see link above). Th\nus, we agree with DECC that heat networks have a significant role to play, initially fed by combustion fuels via CHP, then also facilitating the transition to very low carbon secondary heat sources that utilise low carbon grid electricity and \nlarge\n heat pu\nmps.  \n&#xa0;\n3.3\n&#xa0; \nSo, both now and as the grid decarbonises, heat networks, in combination with thermal storage, provide an additional distribution and storage vector and can operate as part of an intelligently managed and increasingly integrated power and heat dist\nribution system in London. The GLA has made initial assessments of the role of decentralised energy, low grade heat and thermal \nstorage as part of an intelligently managed energy system for London and is involved in demonstrating this potential at Bunhill \nin Islington, as part of the EU FP7 \nSmart Cities\n supported CELCIUS project.\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n&#xa0; \nThe Mayor requires all major new developments to make use of heat networks and/or CHP where feasible and viable. This requirement sits within an extensive programme of work undert\naken by the GLA in recent years that includes heat demand mapping, embedding Energy Master-plans in the local planning system that describe a preferred solution for strategic decentralised energy opportunity areas, provision of technical guidance on heat n\networks and their integration with London’s current and emerging energy and buildings infrastructure, and support for borough and public sector partners to bring forward and commercialise heat network projects. Our approach has now been adopted by the Heat\n team at DECC. \n&#xa0;\n3.5\n&#xa0; \nHeat networks are not currently given fiscal or regulatory support by government, yet they clearly have a significant role to play in the provision of competitive, low carbon heat in dense urban environments. The Committee should want gove\nrnment to ensure that heat networks can compete on a level playing field. At the moment, competition for heat customers is distorted by government support for some sources of low and zero carbon heat but not others. The result is to narrow the market for h\neat provision through heat networks which, in the absence of such support systems, would often be the most cost effective option.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1\n&#xa0; \nHeat network deployment at the scale envisaged for London represents a signific\nant infrastructural challenge, requiring approximately 3,600km of heat networks to be constructed by 2030 and equates to an investment opportunity of approximately £6bn. As DECC’s Heat strategy notes, there are a number of barriers to the deployment of hea\nt networks at this scale. Below we note three key areas where more consideration by government is needed.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n&#xa0; \nUtility Status -\n The treatment of heat networks in the planning and regulatory regimes is one obstacle we wish to highlight to the Committee. Heat networks are not currently classed as utilities and those deploying networks are not currently given Statutory Undertaker sta\ntus. This can make the planning and deployment of networks slower and more expensive. Heat networks should be given the same status as other key infrastructures, allowing access by right to the highways and under certain circumstances to private land and a\nccess to customers’ premises, such as is available to the water, gas and electricity utilities under their enabling statutes.\n&#xa0;\n4.3\n&#xa0; \nCommercialisation -\n There are barriers to the commercialisation of heat networks that government can and should be helping to rem\nove. These mainly relate to reducing the risk of constructing heat networks and acquiring and maintaining sources of demand for heat. In relation to gaining and retaining heat loads, the central factor is the price at which the heat is offered in compariso\nn with the alternatives. This is related to the point made above, that competition for heat customers is distorted by fiscal support for some sources of low and zero carbon heat. Where government provides external \nsupport it must do so in a way that does n\not distort the ability of the best value option to realise its potential. As is apparent from DECC’s recent heat policy and the GLA research on low grade Secondary heat referenced above, heat network development is the front runner for commercial developme\nnt in many dense urban areas. Government support systems should not place it at a competitive disadvantage.\n&#xa0;\n4.4\n&#xa0; \nThe Committee should also note the role that equitable market access for CHP can play in the commercialisation of heat networks. The sections below on \nLicence-lite\n and ‘embedded benefits’ highlight two key areas where regulatory consistency would enable ma\nrket access for large scale decentralised energy. Government must join up its policies relating to renewable electricity and heat, Electricity Market Reform and other related electricity issues. That must happen to ensure that the introduction of appropria\nte low and zero carbon heat infrastructures is accelerated where they the most economic option and at the least cost to the consumer.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1\n&#xa0; \nAs is noted above, the Mayor is of the view that fiscal support for fuel types and generation tec\nhnologies is currently not fully consistent with the Government’s overarching aims. Insufficient consideration is given to carbon, capacity, efficiency and market access, with an over-emphasis on technologies classed as Renewables. In addition, whilst both\n large-scale and micro- generation of heat or power will receive fiscal support (under the Energy Bill, RHI and FIT regimes), district scale technologies are insufficiently supported. \n&#xa0;\n              Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI)&#xa0;\n5.2\n&#xa0; \nHeat networks –\n Government should mak\ne a distinction in its fiscal treatment between heat networks and the sources of heat energy for them. The RHI could be applied to heat networks beyond the current uplift proposed for connected zero carbon sources. This would not imply fiscal support for f\nossil fuel sources (from gas-fired CHP or boilers) as the support would apply to the network developer not the heat generator. This would recognise the role that networks can play in facilitating the transition to the utilisation of zero carbon heat source\ns (such as those identified in the studies undertaken for the GLA mentioned above), irrespective of the initial source of heat.\n&#xa0;\n5.3\n&#xa0; \nSecondary heat -\n We recognise that the eligibility criteria for the RHI are consistent with EU criteria. However, in the case o\nf heat pumps, government should also consider, in the context of the Energy Efficiency Directive, incentives for the utilisation of non-renewable secondary heat (from industrial and commercial processes), where this does not provide a perverse incentive to\n over-use a high carbon process. \n&#xa0;              Combined Heat and Power &#xa0;5.4\n&#xa0; \nEmbedded Benefits - \nCHP plant connected to the electricity distribution network is currently exempt from the National Grid Company’s transmission network usage charges – a just exemption given t\nhat this plant does not make use of the transmission network. However, these ‘embedded benefits’ are at risk under a review by Ofgem with proposals from the National Grid Company to remove or substantially reduce them. A removal or reduction of these ‘bene\nfits’ would be ill-conceived and would damage the economics of CHP connected to heat networks at a time when DECC is establishing its HNDU with the intention of bringing projects to commercial viability.\n&#xa0;\n5.5\n&#xa0; \nLicence-lite - \nThe Committee should also be aware t\nhat the Mayor has applied to become a distribution network scale licenced electricity supplier under Ofgem’s \nLicence-lite\n regime. \nLicence-lite \nis intended to give smaller generators, such as CHP connected to heat networks, improved access to the electricit\ny retail market and therefore improved returns for the power generated, without the full set of obligations put upon a fully licenced supplier. \nLicence-lite\n has the potential to significantly improve the viability of this form of generation, with the atten\ndant benefits to the provision of low carbon, affordable heat. The Mayor encourages the Committee to fully support government’s, Ofgem’s and the Mayor’s intentions for this reform.\n&#xa0;\n5.6\n&#xa0; \nCarbon floor price –\n Government’s proposal that all fossil fuels burnt in \nCHP plant will be subject to the Climate Change Levy (CCL) at the ‘carbon price support (tax) rates’, regardless of their rating under the CHP Quality Assurance Programme (CHPQA) will substantially erode the tax incentives to invest in CHP in preference to\n less carbon efficient ‘boiler only’ options. The rate for CHP should be set lower, to reflect fully the carbon savings achieved through its use, as opposed to the separate production of heat and power. Good Quality CHP schemes within the CHPQA rating shou\nld be exempt from CCL on the fossil fuel burnt, as they are at present. If this tax relief is not retained, the investment incentives for CHP will be put in jeopardy along with the cost-effective carbon saving potential of this technology.\n&#xa0;              Electricity Market Reform&#xa0;5.7\n&#xa0; \nThermal storage -\n Whilst we recognise that electricity is likely to remain a more valuable commodity than heat, and the Mayor is supportive of innovation in upstream electricity storage, district-scale thermal stores are likely to remain a cost-effective storage solution d\nuring the low carbon transition. Government should give additional consideration to the economic and carbon value that thermal stores can provide to the energy system and support them as a demand-side measure under Electricity Market Reform (EMR) mechanism\ns. Heat storage, which can lop peaks off demand for electricity generating capacity, should be rewarded under the Capacity mechanism.\n&#xa0;\n5.8\n&#xa0; \nDecentralised energy -\n The proposals under the EMR/Energy Bill do not provide a sufficient mechanism for supporting deman\nd side management and decentralised energy. Unless an effective mechanism is put in place, the effect will be to increase the level of base load electricity in a way which will not be cost effective for consumers and will diminish incentive to invest in ca\nrbon saving demand side measures, including decentralised energy. The model \ntakes no account of heat, although the availability of waste heat and heat production in combined heat and power is integral with electricity production. Low carbon electricity gen\nerating plant which provides usable heat should be eligible for an ‘uplift’ under the FIT model adopted, to reflect the cost of the transmission of the heat to its point of consumption. In this context, government should implement in full Article 14 of the\n Energy Efficiency Directive, giving sufficient fiscal recognition to the generation of heat as a by-product of power, where the heat is distributed via a heat network.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;6.1\n&#xa0; \nLondon faces significant air quality challenges. Around 75% of London co\nntinues to be covered by Air Quality Management Areas, where concentrations of either NO\n2\n or particulates are near to or exceed EU standards. \n&#xa0;\n6.2\n&#xa0; \nWhile EU limit values for particulate matter are now broadly being met, the latest health evidence suggests \nfurther reductions – especially for PM\n2.5\n – are needed. As such, biomass boilers are not an appropriate technology in these areas due to their increased particulate emissions, except where they have appropriate abatement equipment. The Mayor has recently p\nublished new biomass emission standards for consultation, which are expected to be adopted as supplementary planning guidance to the London Plan by the end of the year. However, the RHI for biomass poses a risk that more ‘unabated’ biomass boilers will app\near in these areas.\n&#xa0;\n6.3\n&#xa0; \nGas engine CHP produces approximately three times the NO\n2\n of a heat-only boiler producing an equivalent amount of heat. Our energy and planning policies support the deployment of gas engine CHP in the short to medium term and to meet o\nur decentralised energy supply target we envisage approximately 675GWh of heat and power from gas engine CHP by 2030. We view this as an interim technology that will support the establishment of heat networks, with the fuels and plant being replaced over t\nime with lower NO\n2\n solutions. Larger CCGT engines with NO\n2 \nabatement equipment are projected to provide 10,000GWh of heat and power by 2030, with waste derived fuels and ‘secondary’ process and environmental heat sources complementing these, and beginning \nto replace them over the period to 2050. \n&#xa0;\n6.4\n&#xa0; \nRetrofit programmes will mitigate NO\n2 \nfrom individual gas boilers and we are beginning to take account of these emissions in the targeting of our retrofit programmes. Road vehicles remain the major contributors to\n poor air quality in London.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nBarriers to Green Deal and ECO in London&#xa0;7.1\n&#xa0; \nAround a third of London’s emissions are from homes, and roughly 80 per cent of London’s current buildings will still be in use in 2050. However, \ninstalling ene\nrgy efficiency measures in London’s homes under the Green Deal and ECO programmes remains extremely challenging.\n&#xa0;\n7.2\n&#xa0; \nSixty per cent of London homes have solid walls, making them more expensive and challenging to retrofit. The ECO Carbon Saving Target is aimed\n predominantly at insulating hard-to-treat walls; however, nearly 90 per cent of the hard to treat insulation measures installed under this ECO target so far (end of June 2013) have been hard to treat cavity, as opposed to solid wall insulation.\n&#xa0;\n7.3\n&#xa0; \nAlmost 50\n per cent of London’s homes are flats, which are logistically harder to retrofit than houses.  Additionally, permitted development regulations, which now permit external solid wall insulation under certain conditions, do not apply to flats, even where the \nbuilding is a flat conversion. Combined with solid walls, this means 70 per cent of London’s homes are hard to treat. Higher costs and complex logistics are intrinsic challenges to retrofitting flatted properties; coupled with the lower carbon- and bill-sa\nving impact of insulating these homes, ECO and Green Deal become less cost-effective in London.\n&#xa0;\n7.4\n&#xa0; \nRoughly half of England’s conservation areas are in London, accounting for some 13 per cent of the capital’s homes. So, certain types of glazing, solid wall in\nsulation and microgeneration technologies are less suitable or more expensive to install.\n&#xa0;\n7.5\n&#xa0; \nLondon also has the highest proportion of private rented homes in England. Landlords have very little incentive to make energy efficiency improvements, as they do no\nt receive, or do not perceive, a direct return from the costs and hassle of installing energy measures. Despite financial incentives, the rates of energy efficiency installation in this sector have been low. Green Deal finance is not currently available to\n landlords; the Green Deal leads and landlord engagement initiated through London’s RE:NEW homes retrofit programme and DECC’s Green Deal Pioneer Places funding in London is at risk of ‘going cold’ whilst legislative issues are being overcome before landlo\nrds can be provided with a Green Deal offer.\n&#xa0;\n7.6\n&#xa0; \nGreen Deal finance, under the Golden Rule, may cover a lower proportion of the total costs of installations in London, since delivery costs are higher but cost-benefits per a measure remain the same (if not low\ner, due to the smaller size of London homes).  This also inhibits ECO delivery, which requires other sources of funding to be cost-effective.\n&#xa0;The effect of these barriers on investment in London&#xa0;\n7.7\n&#xa0; \nDespite the fact that London has 12 per cent of the UK hous\ning stock, it received only 5 per cent of CERT and CESP funding. Twenty per cent of ECO-eligible households or areas are located in London. Without reform of the scheme the contribution London receives will again be significantly less than this figure due \nto the issues noted above.\n&#xa0;\n7.8\n&#xa0; \nWhilst we recognise that the primary intention of previous versions of the Supplier Obligation has been to deliver the most cost-effective carbon savings, \nthe intention of ECO, as expressed by DECC, is to fund less cost-effectiv\ne measures and in those areas that did not receive sufficient support under previous Supplier Obligation regimes. \n&#xa0;\n7.9\n&#xa0; \nGovernment should consider how to reform ECO such that it provides sufficient incentive to invest in measures suitable for London. As it sta\nnds, Londoners are effectively subsidising other regions. This contributes to fuel poverty in London. It also creates a drag on the efficiency of London’s economy and in turn on London’s competitiveness with other global cities, which it must maintain in o\nrder to continue to make its vital contribution to the UK economy. \n&#xa0;\n7.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhilst district heating schemes can qualify for funding under ECO, the current two year target as well as uncertainty regarding longer-term target discourage energy suppliers from investi\nng in these schemes.  Government should consider setting longer term targets for the next phases of ECO, or provide guidance on how investment in district heating schemes can contribute to current or future targets.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n8.1\n&#xa0; \nCLG’s recent \nconsultation on its outline proposals for Allowable Solutions favours a market-based approach, with no constraint on location of the measures the developer invests in. We understand that an intention of both CLG and DECC is that Allowable Solutions should \nsupport heat network deployment and non-basic heat demand reduction measures, complementary to those supported under schemes such as ECO. However, whilst London has the largest potential market for heat network investment and non-basic efficiency measures,\n the proposals as they stand risk creating exactly the same obstacles to investment in London – whether in heat networks or efficiency measures – as are described in section 7 above. \n&#xa0;\n8.2\n&#xa0; \nWe estimate that London housing development will generate at the very least £25m per annum under the proposed Allowable Solutions regime – by far the greatest amount of any region. Yet, because measures are likely to be cheaper outside London, London busin\nesses and households will again be subsidising other regions and receiving less investment into low carbon, heating bill reducing measures. In addition, as Allowable Solutions investment is likely to lever ECO investment, there is a risk that the proposed \nscheme will exacerbate the imbalance in ECO investment away from London. In our response to CLG, we will be recommending revisions to the proposals that allow a market-based approach and cost-effectiveness for developers, but retain investment within Londo\nn. We would be happy to share this with the Committee. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nEnergy efficiency, heat network development and grid decarbonisation are complementary. More efficient, high density buildings are more suitable to \nreceive lower temperature ‘secondary’ h\neat, upgraded via large heat pumps, stored when grid electricity is cheapest, distributed via heat networks (see 2.5 above and the reports highlighted). Government’s regulatory and fiscal regimes should be rebalanced to allow this virtuous and highly effic\nient cycle to emerge in cities. Along with power and heat market reform, this would accelerate and reduce the costs of the transition to low carbon heat in UK cities, much as it is doing in other Northern European cities. \n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
