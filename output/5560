[normal]Supplementary written evidence from Anthony Stansfeld, 
[normal]Police and Crime Commissioner for Thames Valley [PCC Progress 48]
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE – 7[bold]th[bold] JANUARY 2014[bold]ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUESTED FROM ANTHONY STANSFELD,[bold]PCC FOR THAMES VALLEY, CONCERNING THE ISSUE OF COLLABORATION [bold]([bold]in connection with Mr [bold]Stansfeld’s[bold] response [bold]at[bold] Q219[bold] of the transcript[bold])[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]SOUTH EAST REGIONAL ORGANISED CRIME UNIT ([bold]SEROCU[bold])[bold] [bold]- SINGLE COMMAND MODEL FOR COUNTER TERRORISM AND[bold]SERIOUS ORGANISED CRIME[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]BACKGROUND[bold]&#xa0;[bold]To develop the South East region’s capacity and capability to tackle 
[normal]s
[normal]erious and 
[normal]o
[normal]rganised 
[normal]c
[normal]rime, regional Chief Constables and Police and Crime Commissioners have agreed to a new single command model which incorporates regional Counter Terrorism (CT) and Serious and Organised Crime (SOC) assets. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In 2010 Chief Constables and representatives of the 
[normal]p
[normal]olice 
[normal]a
[normal]uthorities signed Section 23 agreements for the South East Regional Organised Crime Unit (SEROCU), South East Covert Operations (SECOU), South East Technical Surveillance (SETSU) and the South East Protected Person Scheme (SEPPS). These regional units were formed from existing Force capability and based upon a ‘Lead Force’ model with Sussex leading SEROCU, Thames Valley SETSU, Hampshire SEPPS and Surrey SECOU.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In
[normal] November 2012 three options were 
[normal]considered by the Chief Constables across the South East region 
[normal]for the future approach to tackling SOC and CT in the region. The option to develop a single command model incorporating regional CT and SOC assets supported by a common infrastructure was 
[normal]subsequently 
[normal]agreed by the Chief Constables and PCCs. 
[normal]This initiative is intended to complement the work of the National Crime Agency.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Following this decision a programme of work started with a two phased approach. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The first phase of work is now complete which saw the alignment of the SEROCU, SECOU, SETSU and SEPPS under a single command structure.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Phase Two
[normal] is now underway with detailed planning taking place to develop and implement the future command model and alignment to the South East Counter Terrorism Unit. Subject to consultation, the HR model for the realigned regional SOC units will be a Thames Valley Police host force model, with a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between regional Chief Constables. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In addition to this the Home Office ha
[normal]s
[normal] given regional organised crime units a grant to fund the development of additional capabilities in serious organised crime. 
[normal]Accordingly, the
[normal] regional Chief Constables and
[normal] Police and Crime Commissioners considered proposals 
[normal]to address current capability gaps in confidential unit, prison intelligence, cyber crime and fraud
[normal] and approved the relevant business cases
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Recruitment for the heads of these new regional units has begun and they will be responsible for building and recruiting their team. They will be employed by the host force (Thames Valley Police) and will sit within the current regional organised crime unit structure.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]An 
[normal]Assistant Chief Constable has been appointed to lead the new regional CT and SOC command, working for and accountable to the whole region and all five Chief Constables, tak
[normal]i
[normal]n
[normal]g
[normal] up the role with effect from 1
[normal]st
[normal] October 2013.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The timescales for the completion for this 
[normal]second 
[normal]phase is April 2014, which includes the first implementation phase for the additional capabilities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]SE ROCU [bold]BUSINESS CASE[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The vision for the South East 
[normal]Regional
[normal] Organised Crime and Counter Terrorism Command for the forces of Surrey, Sussex, Kent, Hampshire and Thames Valley Police is:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“To create a cohesive regional response to serious organised crime aligned to the current South East Counter Terrorism unit.  Delivering enhanced interoperability and resilience across the region supporting all local Forces as well as national agencies and capabilities.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The work to build a South East Regional
[normal] 
[normal]Organised Crime Unit (SEROCU) is driven by a number of key factors including:- 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]national 
[normal]review of Regional Organised Crime Units identified that there is not a consistent national network to link to national agencies, and presented a professional approach that seeks to define what functions, capacity and capability should be hosted within the regional structure.  It stated that it is never intended that the regional function provides for the entire requirement for the region and the host Forces; rather that the regional function provides the more specialist niche capability in a consistent manner that is both operationally and financially efficient.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]These 
[normal]regional 
[normal]functions are:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.
[normal]              
[normal]Intelligence – the regional intelligence unit
[normal]2. 
[normal]              
[normal]Confidential intelligence – a confidential unit
[normal]3. 
[normal]              
[normal]Covert policing – a collaborative approach to delivering and managing undercover operations and activity
[normal]4.
[normal]              
[normal]Financial investigation and asset recovery team – the regional asset recovery teams
[normal]5. 
[normal]              
[normal]Fraud investigation – the potential for the regional fraud investigation teams
[normal]6. 
[normal]              
[normal]Technical surveillance
[normal]7. 
[normal]              
[normal]Protected persons/witness protection
[normal]8. 
[normal]              
[normal]Cyber crime and e-crime
[normal]9. 
[normal]              
[normal]Operational Security
[normal]10. 
[normal]              
[normal]GAIN – the 
[normal]‘
[normal]Government Agency Intelligence Network
[normal]’
[normal]11. 
[normal]              
[normal]Prison Intelligence
[normal]12. 
[normal]              
[normal]Operational Investigative Teams
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]national 
[normal]review of the ROCUs 
[normal]also 
[normal]made reference to the possible 
[normal]synergies and efficiencies with the counter terrorism (CT) infrastructure, in particular around issues such as sharing accommodation, sharing leadership, sharing back office support and at times sharing specialist assets. 
[normal] It was recognised that the policing response to serious and organised crime is not the same as that required to tackle terrorism, and this position is based upon the day to day impact and the hugely diverse nature of the criminality – requiring an overall approach from neighbourhood policing upwards.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Whilst the South East region has established a strong response to serious organised crime
[normal],
[normal] the 
[normal]previous (pre-SE ROCU)
[normal] arrangements 
[normal]we
[normal]re inefficient due to their complexity and there are additional capabilities that can be included within the 
[normal]new 
[normal]regional remit. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Having taken account of all these factors, the South East Serious Organised Crime and the South East Counter Terrorism Unit are being aligned, 
[normal]facilitated by
[normal] the addition of a Regional A
[normal]ssistant 
[normal]C

[normal](
[normal]Serious Organised Crime and Counter Terrorism
[normal])
[normal].  As the South East Counter Terrorism Unit is 
[normal]currently 
[normal]hosted by Thames Valley Police
[normal],
[normal] the South East 
[normal]Regional 
[normal]Organised Crime Unit follow
[normal]s
[normal] this host force model.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The South East Regional Organised Crime Unit will bring together the current regional organised crime units under the one structure:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Additional capabilities be

[normal](or being assessed 
[normal]to be
[normal])
[normal] included
[normal] within the regional structure
[normal] are

[normal]The services, governed under the umbrella of a Police and Crime Commissioners’ Section 22A Police Act agreement, will incorporate:

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Efficiencies/ Benefits[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]When t
[normal]he new arrangements 
[normal]are fully in place with effect from April 2014 they 
[normal]will create a unified Serious Organised Crime Unit for the S
[normal]outh 
[normal]E
[normal]ast 
[normal]region 
[normal]that will deliver the following benefits
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The overall benefit of a single command structure will be the regional overview of the provision and capability of serious organised crime units and the value for money provided locally, regionally and nationally
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Financ[bold]ial Implications[bold]&#xa0;[bold]a)[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Set Up Costs[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The cost of implementing this programme of work will be mainly staff opportunity costs.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Home Office is providing 
[normal]funding
[normal] to support Regional Organised Crime Unit networks
[normal], including 
[normal]additional investment for the financial year 2013/14.  Th
[normal]is
[normal] 
[normal]additional 
[normal]investment 
[normal]fund
[normal]ing
[normal] is available to strengthen the region’s resilience against organised crime.  Th
[normal]is 
[normal]Home Office investment
[normal] will need to be matched locally by the same level of investment and commitment.  In many cases this 
[normal]can
[normal] be met by redeploying existing operational resources rather than a call on new monetary resources.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The draft 2014/15 spending budget for the SE ROCU is £11.5m.  The source of funding for the Unit 
[normal]to cover this level of planned spending 
[normal]is 
[normal]£8.2m contributions from the five forces and £3.3m from Government grants.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Previously,
[normal] a lead force approach has been adopted for the current regional serious organised crime units 
[normal]under which 
[normal]it was the lead force’s responsibility to provide business support to the unit.  A principle was agreed that the lead force for each of the units could charge 2% of the 
[normal]unit 
[normal]salary costs to the other forces 
[normal]to help cover the cost to the lead force of
[normal] the provision of business support.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is likely to be a cost implication of transferring con
[normal]trol of the agreed 
[normal]SEROCU 
[normal]units to T
[normal]hames 
[normal]V
[normal]alley 
[normal]P
[normal]olice
[normal]. 
[normal]This will arise from increasing the business support functions in SE Counter Terrorism Unit (SECTU) to cope with the SOC assets. There will however be compensating savings for each force 
[normal]by the removal of the 2% charge 
[normal]currently 
[normal]levied by 
[normal]the four separate SE 
[normal]lead 
[normal]forces on 
[normal]individual unit 
[normal]salary costs. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In setting up the South East Regional Organised Crime Units under a host force model it is assumed that the overall 
[normal]budget
[normal] for the unit will remain the same (increasing in line with inflation).  However, the new, single, 
[normal]host f
[normal]orce is responsible for all business support and administration, including HR, Finance, Procurement and Estates.  This will provide economies of scale compared to the 
[normal]current provision by four lead forces that will release cost savings and/or service productivity gains. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The build of this 
[normal]single 
[normal]command 
[normal]model 
[normal]will also provide an opportunity to revisit the current funding model for regional units and the provision of business support.
[normal]  
[normal]Accordingly, work is currently underway to produce the regional ‘Collaboration Finance Protocol and Principles’ 
[normal](to be incorporated into the S22A Agreement) 
[normal]and a ‘Principles for a Cost Apportionment Model’ for approval and adoption for both this SE ROCU collaboration model and all other future SE Region collaborations.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Collaboration [bold]Risks [bold]&#xa0;[bold]The following risks have been identified in relation to the regional delivery of serious organised crime and counter terrorism:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1. 
[normal]              
[normal]Loss of skills - there is a risk that key skills will be lost as staff 
[normal]may 
[normal]seek employment elsewhere.  This will impact on the ability of units to maintain business as usual.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. 
[normal]              
[normal]Staff morale - there is a risk that morale will decline due to 
[normal]‘
[normal]change fatigue
[normal]’
[normal],
[normal] which 
[normal]may
[normal] impact on performance.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. 
[normal]              
[normal]Inadequate project resourcing - there is a risk that inadequate project resourcing will undermine project delivery and cause delays.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. 
[normal]              
[normal]Internal Change Programmes - conflict of priorities with individual internal 
[normal]force 
[normal]change programmes
[normal],
[normal] e.g. estates strategies.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. 
[normal]              
[normal]Perceived risk to transparency of tasking - CT assets are nationally owned and co-ordinated and regionally based
[normal],
[normal] whereas SOC assets are locally owned and regionally based.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6. 
[normal]              
[normal]Perceived risk to command/ownership - a host f
[normal]orce model is being 
[normal]adopt
[normal]ed;
[normal] the perception could be that the host force would provide the sole command rather than the reality of it being a regional command of regional assets.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Risk mitigation action plans have been developed and implemented to address and minimise these risks.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]GOVERNANCE[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The PCCs and Chief Constables across the South East region established a ‘Regional Collaboration Gov
[normal]ernance Board’
[normal] in July 2013
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The membership of the Board comprises the PCCs and chief constables of all the force areas across the South East. The Board is scheduled to meet quarterly and minutes of all meetings will be taken.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Board will:

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I hope you find the information presented above
[normal] concerning collaboration activity across the South East region both
[normal] informative and useful to your Committee’s enquiries.
