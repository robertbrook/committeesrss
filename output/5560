defaultSOUTH EAST REGIONAL ORGANISED CRIME UNIT (defaultSEROCUdefault)default default- SINGLE COMMAND MODEL FOR COUNTER TERRORISM ANDdefaultSERIOUS ORGANISED CRIMEdefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultBACKGROUNDdefault&#xa0;defaultTo develop the South East region’s capacity and capability to tackle 
defaults
defaulterious and 
defaulto
defaultrganised 
defaultc
defaultrime, regional Chief Constables and Police and Crime Commissioners have agreed to a new single command model which incorporates regional Counter Terrorism (CT) and Serious and Organised Crime (SOC) assets. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn 2010 Chief Constables and representatives of the 
defaultp
defaultolice 
defaulta
defaultuthorities signed Section 23 agreements for the South East Regional Organised Crime Unit (SEROCU), South East Covert Operations (SECOU), South East Technical Surveillance (SETSU) and the South East Protected Person Scheme (SEPPS). These regional units were formed from existing Force capability and based upon a ‘Lead Force’ model with Sussex leading SEROCU, Thames Valley SETSU, Hampshire SEPPS and Surrey SECOU.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn
default November 2012 three options were 
defaultconsidered by the Chief Constables across the South East region 
defaultfor the future approach to tackling SOC and CT in the region. The option to develop a single command model incorporating regional CT and SOC assets supported by a common infrastructure was 
defaultsubsequently 
defaultagreed by the Chief Constables and PCCs. 
defaultThis initiative is intended to complement the work of the National Crime Agency.
default&#xa0;
defaultFollowing this decision a programme of work started with a two phased approach. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe first phase of work is now complete which saw the alignment of the SEROCU, SECOU, SETSU and SEPPS under a single command structure.
default&#xa0;
defaultPhase Two
default is now underway with detailed planning taking place to develop and implement the future command model and alignment to the South East Counter Terrorism Unit. Subject to consultation, the HR model for the realigned regional SOC units will be a Thames Valley Police host force model, with a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between regional Chief Constables. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition to this the Home Office ha
defaults
default given regional organised crime units a grant to fund the development of additional capabilities in serious organised crime. 
defaultAccordingly, the
default regional Chief Constables and
default Police and Crime Commissioners considered proposals 
defaultto address current capability gaps in confidential unit, prison intelligence, cyber crime and fraud
default and approved the relevant business cases
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultRecruitment for the heads of these new regional units has begun and they will be responsible for building and recruiting their team. They will be employed by the host force (Thames Valley Police) and will sit within the current regional organised crime unit structure.
default&#xa0;
defaultAn 
defaultAssistant Chief Constable has been appointed to lead the new regional CT and SOC command, working for and accountable to the whole region and all five Chief Constables, tak

defaultst
default October 2013.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe timescales for the completion for this 
defaultsecond 
defaultphase is April 2014, which includes the first implementation phase for the additional capabilities.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultSE ROCU defaultBUSINESS CASEdefault&#xa0;defaultThe vision for the South East 
defaultRegional
default Organised Crime and Counter Terrorism Command for the forces of Surrey, Sussex, Kent, Hampshire and Thames Valley Police is:
default&#xa0;
default“To create a cohesive regional response to serious organised crime aligned to the current South East Counter Terrorism unit.  Delivering enhanced interoperability and resilience across the region supporting all local Forces as well as national agencies and capabilities.”
default&#xa0;
defaultThe work to build a South East Regional
default 
defaultOrganised Crime Unit (SEROCU) is driven by a number of key factors including:- 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultnational 
defaultreview of Regional Organised Crime Units identified that there is not a consistent national network to link to national agencies, and presented a professional approach that seeks to define what functions, capacity and capability should be hosted within the regional structure.  It stated that it is never intended that the regional function provides for the entire requirement for the region and the host Forces; rather that the regional function provides the more specialist niche capability in a consistent manner that is both operationally and financially efficient.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThese 
defaultregional 
defaultfunctions are:
default&#xa0;
default1.
default              
defaultIntelligence – the regional intelligence unit
default2. 
default              
defaultConfidential intelligence – a confidential unit
default3. 
default              
defaultCovert policing – a collaborative approach to delivering and managing undercover operations and activity
default4.

defaultFinancial investigation and asset recovery team – the regional asset recovery teams

default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultnational 
defaultreview of the ROCUs 
defaultalso 
defaultmade reference to the possible 
defaultsynergies and efficiencies with the counter terrorism (CT) infrastructure, in particular around issues such as sharing accommodation, sharing leadership, sharing back office support and at times sharing specialist assets. 
default It was recognised that the policing response to serious and organised crime is not the same as that required to tackle terrorism, and this position is based upon the day to day impact and the hugely diverse nature of the criminality – requiring an overall approach from neighbourhood policing upwards.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhilst the South East region has established a strong response to serious organised crime
default,
default the 
defaultprevious (pre-SE ROCU)
default arrangements 
defaultwe
defaultre inefficient due to their complexity and there are additional capabilities that can be included within the 
defaultnew 
defaultregional remit. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHaving taken account of all these factors, the South East Serious Organised Crime and the South East Counter Terrorism Unit are being aligned, 
defaultfacilitated by
default the addition of a Regional A

default the South East 
defaultRegional

defaults

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe South East Regional Organised Crime Unit will bring together the current regional organised crime units under the one structure:

defaultthat will deliver the following benefits
default:
default&#xa0;
defaultThe overall benefit of a single command structure will be the regional overview of the provision and capability of serious organised crime units and the value for money provided locally, regionally and nationally

default&#xa0;defaultFinancdefaultial Implicationsdefault&#xa0;defaulta)default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSet Up Costsdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe cost of implementing this programme of work will be mainly staff opportunity costs.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Home Office is providing 
defaultfunding
default to support Regional Organised Crime Unit networks
default, including 
defaultadditional investment for the financial year 2013/14.  Th
defaultis
default 
defaultadditional 
defaultinvestment 
defaultfund
defaulting
default is available to strengthen the region’s resilience against organised crime.  Th
defaultis 
defaultHome Office investment
default will need to be matched locally by the same level of investment and commitment.  In many cases this 
defaultcan
default be met by redeploying existing operational resources rather than a call on new monetary resources.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe draft 2014/15 spending budget for the SE ROCU is £11.5m.  The source of funding for the Unit 
defaultto cover this level of planned spending 
defaultis 
default£8.2m contributions from the five forces and £3.3m from Government grants.
default&#xa0;
defaultPreviously,
default a lead force approach has been adopted for the current regional serious organised crime units 
defaultunder which 
defaultit was the lead force’s responsibility to provide business support to the unit.  A principle was agreed that the lead force for each of the units could charge 2% of the 
defaultunit 
defaultsalary costs to the other forces 
defaultto help cover the cost to the lead force of
default the provision of business support.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is likely to be a cost implication of transferring con
defaulttrol of the agreed 
defaultSEROCU 
defaultunits to T
defaulthames 
defaultV
defaultalley 
defaultP
defaultolice
default. 
defaultThis will arise from increasing the business support functions in SE Counter Terrorism Unit (SECTU) to cope with the SOC assets. There will however be compensating savings for each force 
defaultby the removal of the 2% charge 
defaultcurrently 
defaultlevied by 
defaultthe four separate SE 
defaultlead 
defaultforces on 
defaultindividual unit 
defaultsalary costs. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn setting up the South East Regional Organised Crime Units under a host force model it is assumed that the overall 
defaultbudget
default for the unit will remain the same (increasing in line with inflation).  However, the new, single, 
defaulthost f
defaultorce is responsible for all business support and administration, including HR, Finance, Procurement and Estates.  This will provide economies of scale compared to the 
defaultcurrent provision by four lead forces that will release cost savings and/or service productivity gains. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe build of this 
defaultsingle 
defaultcommand 
defaultmodel 
defaultwill also provide an opportunity to revisit the current funding model for regional units and the provision of business support.
default  
defaultAccordingly, work is currently underway to produce the regional ‘Collaboration Finance Protocol and Principles’ 
default(to be incorporated into the S22A Agreement) 
defaultand a ‘Principles for a Cost Apportionment Model’ for approval and adoption for both this SE ROCU collaboration model and all other future SE Region collaborations.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultCollaboration defaultRisks default&#xa0;defaultThe following risks have been identified in relation to the regional delivery of serious organised crime and counter terrorism:
default&#xa0;
default1. 
default              
defaultLoss of skills - there is a risk that key skills will be lost as staff 
defaultmay 
defaultseek employment elsewhere.  This will impact on the ability of units to maintain business as usual.
default&#xa0;
default2. 
default              
defaultStaff morale - there is a risk that morale will decline due to 
default‘
defaultchange fatigue
default’
default,
default which 
defaultmay
default impact on performance.
default&#xa0;
default3. 
default              
defaultInadequate project resourcing - there is a risk that inadequate project resourcing will undermine project delivery and cause delays.
default&#xa0;
default4. 
default              
defaultInternal Change Programmes - conflict of priorities with individual internal 
defaultforce 
defaultchange programmes
default,
default e.g. estates strategies.
default&#xa0;
default5. 
default              
defaultPerceived risk to transparency of tasking - CT assets are nationally owned and co-ordinated and regionally based
default,
default whereas SOC assets are locally owned and regionally based.
default&#xa0;
default6. 
default              
defaultPerceived risk to command/ownership - a host f
defaultorce model is being 
defaultadopt
defaulted;
default the perception could be that the host force would provide the sole command rather than the reality of it being a regional command of regional assets.
default&#xa0;
defaultRisk mitigation action plans have been developed and implemented to address and minimise these risks.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultGOVERNANCEdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe PCCs and Chief Constables across the South East region established a ‘Regional Collaboration Gov
defaulternance Board’
default in July 2013
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe membership of the Board comprises the PCCs and chief constables of all the force areas across the South East. The Board is scheduled to meet quarterly and minutes of all meetings will be taken.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Board will:
