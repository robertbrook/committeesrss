"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the\nAssociation of Policing and Crime Chief Executives\n [PCC Progress 03]\n&#xa0;&#xa0;We note with interest that \nthe \nterms of reference \nfor the upcoming \nHASC \nrefer to\n “the role of the PCP in \nholding\n to account\n the PCC”. \nAs this is not an accurate reflection of the legislation w\ne believe that this \nhas the potential to confuse the public understanding \nof the way \nin which \npolice and crime panels \nactually \nwork. \nThe\n more accurate view is that \np\nolice and \nc\nrime \np\nanel\ns \nmust be\n established \nby local authorities in order \nto \nscrutinize\n \nthe decisions and actions of \ntheir PCC\n and to exercise their function\ns\n in a way that supports the PCC.\n&#xa0;\nThe distinction \nbetween ‘holding to account’ and any other relationship in the governance arrangements may seem slight but this is not semantics; it is a key component of the new constitutional model, something that – as Committee members will be aware - wa\ns evident in the \ndebates during the passage of the Bill and the subsequent \nstatutory framework\n established under the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011.\n&#xa0;\nThe\n express duties of ‘holding to account’ and the relationship that this implies are fundamental to the new governance arrangements for policing and crime.  \n \nThe PCC (or the \nLondon\n equivalent) holds the\nir\n chief officer of police to account for the delive\nry of policing in their area, while t\nhe PCC is, in turn, held to account by their electorate.  \n&#xa0;\nT\nhe PCP \nhas a number of key statutory functions\n,\n principally around the setting of the local precept, the Police and Crime Plan and the appointment of senior officer holders; the \np\nanel is also responsible for dealing with non-criminal complaints about the conduct of the PCC and their deputy if they have one. The PCP \nmust support the effective exercise of the functions of PCC.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe \nrequest\n that\n \nthis issue of clarification \nis brought to the attention of the Chair \nand \nhope that these brief but important points \nwill assist the committee\n in their deliberations\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n              \n              \n              \n              \nMiranda Carruthers-Watt\n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \nChair, Association of Policing and Crime Chief Executives &#xa0;\n"
