[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1&#xa0; Gatwick Airport Limited welcomes the opportunity to respond to the ‘Winter resilience in transport’ inquiry. Since the severe weather that was experienced in 2009-2010 Gatwick has undertaken a number of measures, including investing £8 million to significantly increase our snow clearing equipment, to ensure that the airport is fully prepared to deal with adverse weather conditions. 1.2&#xa0; In relation to winter resilience, Gatwick’s priorities are to maintain a safe pavement surface condition for aircraft operations, minimise disruption to airport operations and reduce inconvenience to airline passengers. In order to do this, we work closely with our airlines and their ground handlers, NATs and other airport partners under a clear command and control structure. It is essential that all partners work well together to ensure success. 1.3&#xa0; We are confident that the necessary steps have been taken to ensure that Gatwick is best placed to cope with adverse weather. This was highlighted over the most recent winter period 2012/2013 when Gatwick was able to remain open throughout the winter period. This was in contrast to other London airports which were forced to close or to cancel hundreds of flights the day before, causing widespread disruption to thousands of passengers. &#xa0;&#xa0;2.1&#xa0; Gatwick Airport is the UK’s second largest airport and the busiest single-runway airport in the world. It serves more than 195 destinations in 90 countries for around 34.2 million passengers a year on short- and long-haul point-to-point services (source: OAG). It is also a major economic driver for the South-East region, generating around 23,000 on-airport jobs and a further 13,000 jobs through related activities. The airport is 28 miles south of London with excellent public transport links, including the Gatwick Express. Gatwick Airport is owned by a group of international investment and pension funds.2.2&#xa0; The winter season runs from 1st November to 31st March and throughout this period Gatwick Airport is responsible for clearing snow and anti-icing the runway, taxiways, car parks and airport roads. This amounts to 1.8 million sq. ft of runway and 23 miles of surface roads. During the winter season, we handle on average 650 flights per day, carrying approximately 100,000 passengers a day (arriving &amp; departing).               2.3&#xa0; In December 2010 transport networks across Europe faced significant disruption due to snow and ice. Airports experienced operational impacts which, alongside safety considerations, resulted in flight delays and cancellations. Gatwick was affected by the adverse weather conditions on two occasions during this period.2.4&#xa0; Since this period Gatwick has undertaken a series of measures to mitigate the possible risks of adverse weather. Gatwick has a clearly defined command and control structure, which is designed to deal with events such as extreme weather in an efficient and effective manner. 2.5&#xa0; In early 2013 the South East experienced over 5cm of snow. During this period, Gatwick was able to keep the airport open and running having introduced measures to deal with such problems. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1&#xa0; For all types of incident or disruptive events Gatwick Airport Limited has a well-developed command and control structure. This is modeled on the three tier structure of Gold (strategic), Silver (tactical) and Bronze (operational). The three tier command and control model is well understood and regularly rehearsed. 3.2&#xa0; As part of this structure, Gatwick has an Airport Snow Plan. The aim of this plan is to deal with the impact of snow and ice in a professional manner, with a clear and constant focus on minimising disruption and inconvenience to airline passengers. In order to minimise risks, Gatwick works closely with our airlines and their handling agents, NATs and other airport partners. Throughout any disruption we are dedicated to the welfare of passengers and the provision of timely communications to airport users and external audiences.3.3&#xa0; Throughout these periods Gatwick also works closely with the DfT, ensuring they are kept up to date with all relevant developments. This includes regular Situation Reports with the Department to keep them informed of our handling of the situation. 3.4&#xa0; Our command and control contingency process is central to our ability to react swiftly and in a co-ordinated manner. The structure allows the inclusion of other stakeholders to facilitate a multi- agency response.  This involves ensuring that all parties are familiar with this process and the use of the relevant tools such as the Common Recognised Information Picture (CRIP) and Situation Reports. In order to improve performance Gatwick has invested £397,000 in upgrading the IT &amp; Communications equipment within the Silver and Bronze Disruption Suites.3.5&#xa0; Gatwick has coherent and interlocked plans, starting with the seven weather states (see Appendix A) that dictate activation of certain elements of the plans. These plans have been shared with the airport community so that they understand and agree the processes. To ensure that the airport is ready and prepared in advance, each business function across the airport has identified the resources required to be effective.  These elements are separately listed with a Red, Amber or Green (RAG) status.  This allows for the silver and bronze command structures to have an instant Common Recognised Information Picture to aid their decision making.  The status of each element is reviewed at each weather state within the plans, ensuring that the decision makers have accurate information.3.6&#xa0; Gatwick also engages other surface providers such as the rail, road, coach, car parking and car rental companies, in order to align their plans with the airports.  All surface providers update Gatwick every two hours during disruption so that we can update our passengers and staff with the latest information.  The weather states and trigger points have also been provided to Sussex Police to assist with their preparedness for any disruption.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.1&#xa0; Since 2009 Gatwick has invested £8million in airfield snow clearing vehicles and equipment.  This has increased the vehicle fleet from 47 to 107, with an additional 70 pieces of snow clearing equipment enabling Gatwick to clear the runway in a single sweep whilst simultaneously clearing taxiways and stands.  Over this period Gatwick has also doubled the number of vehicles available to the Surface Access team, increasing their capability to clear landside footpaths and roads.4.2&#xa0; Gatwick now has 230 staff trained to operate the snow clearing equipment; this includes Handling Agent staff to assist with the clearance of aircraft stands and 150 business partners to clear landside areas. 4.3&#xa0; Gatwick has also developed a trained pool of non-operational staff who can be called on to assist with the implementation of the plans. They are designated as ‘Polar bears’, (airside snow clearance) ‘Operational Foxes’, (frontline support) ‘Operational Leopards’, (leadership of support roles) and ‘Yetis’, (landside snow clearance).  There are also 154 non-operational staff members that have been trained in bag loading to support the Security Operation (see Appendix B).  4.4&#xa0; Each plan has a trigger point as to when each of these pools are made aware (standby) and deployed to ensure that the optimum resource is available.  To ensure that critical staff have the best chance of getting to the airport Gatwick has enabled all staff to order (free of charge) snow socks for their cars, and developed into the plan points where 4x4 vehicles will pick up staff.  The pick-up plan also incorporates Border Force staff.4.5&#xa0; In respect of anti–icing and de-icing Gatwick has increased its liquid storage capacity from 170,000 litres to over 500,000 litres and additionally holds 45,000kg of solid media (i.e. salt) which is sufficient for a ‘normal’ season or ten days of extreme conditions.  There is also a contingency temporary storage facility for a further 147,000 litres.  Gatwick has also increased its de-icing fleet from three to six. This winter Gatwick will take another step forward with the introduction of ‘engines running’ de-icing.  Remote de-icing is available for any airline or de-icing company that have submitted a risk assessment and method statement. 4.6&#xa0; To ensure that connectivity to both terminals is maintained to an optimum level, improvements have also been made to the inter-terminal shuttle.  Power rail heating and brushes have been installed and a new 5,000 litre Konsin tank has been installed which pumps anti–icing fluid to the carriages.&#xa0;

[[[Future Resilience across the London Airport System]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]5.1&#xa0; One of the key issues that will need to be addressed when looking at future resilience across the London airport system is Heathrow’s over scheduling of flights in the key winter months. In order to ensure that the best plans are in place to deal with any adverse weather Gatwick believes that it is necessary for Heathrow to put in place a more robust plan to ensure future resilience. 5.2&#xa0; In January this year Gatwick called on the Government to bring together London’s three main airports to work out how we can best avoid significant numbers of business and leisure passengers being impacted by large numbers of pre-emptive flight cancellations at Heathrow. This was seen following the unacceptable and damaging number of cancellations at Heathrow when London experienced light amounts of snow early in 2013. 5.3&#xa0; In the long-term, we believe that following the recommendations of the Airports Commission this issue will be addressed with a new runway in the South East creating greater capacity. However it is not likely that this will be delivered until the mid-2020s at the earliest and as such we believe that further measures need to be taken by Heathrow to ensure that such disruptions are limited. Gatwick put forward a number of proposals in a letter to the Secretary of State in January this year. (Appendix C). 5.4&#xa0; In order to ensure that we can limit the impact of adverse weather we believe that Heathrow will need to stop their current approach to overscheduling during December, January and February. We believe it is vital for Heathrow to declare a level of capacity it can cope with in winter conditions. The additional flights then, for those three months, would be able to move to Gatwick and Stansted. As a result there would be better use of the existing capacity at our London airports, safety would be enhanced and passengers will not have to panic every time it snows. As a result we are calling on the airports and airlines to work together to make this happen.5.5&#xa0; Clearly in extreme winter weather conditions a level of disruption at airports is to be expected but we should all be able to be open for business when confronted with normal winter weather conditions as was experienced in January of this year.

[[[Passenger]]]

[[[ Welfare and Information ]]]&#xa0;6.1&#xa0; The welfare of the passenger is paramount to Gatwick and our Snow Plan includes provisions for sleeping areas with beds, blankets, food and water. We have in stock 4,000 blankets, 600 mattresses, four pallets of water (8,000 bottles of water), 600 folding beds, 20 snow shovels, four baby bottle warmers, 10 travel cots and a mixture of baby food and nappies.6.2&#xa0; During periods of disruption, opening times of restaurants and retail outlets are extended. We make all internet-zone access within the terminals free, allowing passengers to check with their airline websites or re-book flights if required.6.3&#xa0; We are also aware of the vital role of communication in any response.  The volunteers are provided with task cards and clear communication links so that they are capable of providing relevant and timely information.  Gatwick has also fully embraced the social media networks and use these to communicate and provide updated information.  Gatwick has modified Flight Information and Passenger Information screens to provide a more flexible information platform. We put on additional staff in the terminals to assist passengers with general enquiries. We also ensure our Twitter feed and our website are constantly updated and monitored. &#xa0;

[[[Conclusion]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]7.1&#xa0; The safety of passengers and airport users will always be our main priority during any adverse weather conditions.  7.2&#xa0; Since the severe weather of 2009-2010 Gatwick has put in a place a series of measures, investing over £8m, in order to minimise any disruption. 7.3&#xa0; The winter period 2012-2013 saw widespread snowfall across the South East; however as a result of the processes in place, Gatwick was able to remain open throughout this period.7.4&#xa0; We believe that Heathrow needs to develop a more robust approach to its winter resilience and that it should look directly at how to limit the overscheduling of flights during the winter months.  7.5&#xa0; We are confident that we have the correct structures in place to continue to uphold the highest of standards when dealing with adverse weather. 7.6&#xa0; We will continue to review any adverse weather events to ensure that we are aware or lessons learnt in order to shape future planning and preparation. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
