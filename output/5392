defaultThe ‘Nudge Unit’ or Behavioural Insights Team did not have any formal discussions with Defra on the proposed plastic bag charge. Although there is good evidence that introducing a 5p charge for single use carrier bags in Wales did dramatically decrease the number of bags issued, specifically by about 80%. 
default&#xa0;defaultAll the charging schemes in place and proposed across the UK have similar structures.
default&#xa0;
default They put in place a 5p charge on carrier bags in order to reduce litter and the environmental cost of producing all that plastic.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are differences across the UK to reflect local circumstances.
default&#xa0;
default In England the charge will focus on plastic bags as it is a targeted, proportionate approach to the problem of carrier bag distribution and littering. The Government will exempt small and medium-sized enterprises to reduce the administrative burden. We also intend to exempt biodegradable bags that meet certain standards.
