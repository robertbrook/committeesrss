[normal]Further written evidence submitted by the [bold]Cabinet Office[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The ‘Nudge Unit’ or Behavioural Insights Team did not have any formal discussions with Defra on the proposed plastic bag charge. Although there is good evidence that introducing a 5p charge for single use carrier bags in Wales did dramatically decrease the number of bags issued, specifically by about 80%. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]All the charging schemes in place and proposed across the UK have similar structures.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] They put in place a 5p charge on carrier bags in order to reduce litter and the environmental cost of producing all that plastic.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There are differences across the UK to reflect local circumstances.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] In England the charge will focus on plastic bags as it is a targeted, proportionate approach to the problem of carrier bag distribution and littering. The Government will exempt small and medium-sized enterprises to reduce the administrative burden. We also intend to exempt biodegradable bags that meet certain standards.
