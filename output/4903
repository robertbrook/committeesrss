[normal]Supplementary written evidence from the RAC Foundation (SRN0057)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]At the Better Roads evidence session yesterday in discussion with Mr Stringer I promised to provide references to specific road schemes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]They are as follows

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The third of these is the most recent and dates from June 2013.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Since then, of course, there have been several further announcements and some 
[normal]of the schemes have been given a firm go-ahead (including the A14).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] We are in the process of compiling a more up to date list.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We very much welcome the Department for Transportâ€™s commitment to create a Roads Investment Strategy and hope that the process 
[normal]of developing that will lead to a coherent government statement of which roads will be improved or built, in what sequence and how they will be paid for.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Yours sincerely
