defaultWritten evidence submitteddefault by the Chartered Institute of Taxationdefault (DWB 16)default&#xa0;defaultThe Chartered Institute of Taxation (CIOT) is 
defaultpleased to submit some general comments on the draft Wales Bill that we hope will be of assistance to the Welsh Affairs Committee. We 
defaultrestrict our comments to taxation matters, our area of expertise. We 
defaultwould be please
defaultd
default to amplify our comments orally or in
default writing if that would be helpful and we look forward to engaging with the Welsh Government as the taxation matters dealt with by the Bill are developed.
default This short paper sets out:
default&#xa0;
defaultProbably the key point we would wish to make is that 
defaultdeveloping fully operational 
defaultdevolv
defaulted taxes will take considerable time and resources. That may seem an obvious 
defaultpoint but the timescales involved and the resources needed must not be underestimated.

defaultThe CIOT is the leading professional body in the United Kingdom concerned solely with taxation. The CIOT is an educational charit
defaulty, promoting education and study of the administration and practice of taxation. One of our key aims is to work for a better, more efficient, tax system for all affected by it – taxpayers, their advisers and the authorities. The CIOT’s work covers all aspe
defaultcts of taxation, including direct and indirect taxes and duties. 
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe CIOT draws on our members’ experience in private practice, commerce and industry, government and academia to improve tax administration and propose and explain how tax policy objectives can most effectively be achieved. We also link to, and draw on, si
defaultmilar leading professional tax bodies in other countries. The CIOT’s comments and recommendations on tax issues are made in line with our charitable objectives: we are politically neutral in our work.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThrough our Low Incomes Tax Reform Group (LITRG), the CIOT has a particular focus on improving the tax system, includ
defaulting tax credits and benefits, for the unrepresented taxpayer. LITRG is an initiative of the CIOT to give 
defaulta voice to the unrepresented, 
defaulti
defaulte
default those who cannot afford to take professional advice. Since 1998 LITRG has been 
defaultworking
default to improve the policy and proce
defaultsses of the tax, tax credits and associated welfare systems for the benefit of those on low incomes. 
default&#xa0;defaultKey principles for taxationdefault&#xa0;default5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultWelsh Government
default has a real opportunity to design the 
defaultdevolved taxes 
defaultin line with proper principles. 
defaultWe think the Welsh
default Affairs Committee could usefully emphasise the importance of these principles in its report.
default&#xa0;
default6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe 
defaultthink there are four
default key principles to be borne in mind in the design of tax systems:
defaultConsultationdefault&#xa0;
default7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe are firm believers in the benefits of proper consultation. The point is to get practical input into the development of new tax law. More subtly, a key benefit is that consultation will make taxpayers and advisers more supportive of the law if they have 
defaultbeen involved with its development. 
default&#xa0;
default8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe are very supportive of the UK Government’s framework for tax consultations as set out in ‘Tax Policy Making: a new approach
default’
default. Its principles parallel our views on what makes effective consultation, views we have pu
defaultt forward many times over the years:
default&#xa0;
default9
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe guiding principle must be that all tax policy changes are consulted on
default. 
defaultThe main exception would be changes in tax rates. We do accept that changes in rates are always going to be a matter for government and would not normally be susceptible
default to consultation, though there have been instances where the implications of what seemed to be rate changes would have emerged with consultation
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default10
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe would be happy to supply fuller comments about consultation, including reflections on our experience of the consultative process, if that were helpful. 
defaultStabilitydefault&#xa0;default11
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA stable tax system – one that changes only when it needs to – is an important part of th
defaulte business environment. Investment is encouraged if businesses have confidence in the way the returns from their investment will be taxed. One of the conclusions of the Office of Tax Simplific
defaultation’s (OTS) first project on small b
defaultusiness
default was that the grea
defaulttest source of complexity for small business is change
default. 
default&#xa0;
default12
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIdeally taxes should be underpinned by a proper framework – key aims for the tax and principles under which it will operate. For the government, the overriding point is 
defaultto promote confidence in the 
defaulttax system. That delivers benefits as taxpayers (business and individual) are more likely to comply with their responsibilities.
defaultCertaintydefault&#xa0;default13
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultStability promotes certainty and many businesses put certainty at the top of their list of what a tax system needs t
defaulto deliver. They want to know what the result of their actions will be in tax terms. For this reason, retrospective changes to tax laws are very damaging and should be avoided: another benefit of consultation, to ‘get it right first time’.
default&#xa0;
default14
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOne manifestatio
defaultn of certainty is that taxes should be laid down clearly in statute. In today’s complex environment, guidance notes by the tax authority will often be necessary, particularly for the unrepresented. But such material should be explanations, assistance and g
defaultuidance, not a way for the tax authority to interpret (or even worse, change) the law to how it thinks it should operate. Citizens should b
defaulte taxed by law, not by guidance,
default nor untaxed by concession.
defaultSimplicitydefault&#xa0;
default15
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTaxes should as far as possible be expressed 
defaultin clear law and be simple to operate. Administrative burdens on taxpayers should be minimised. When developing new tax laws, it should be part of the planning process to develop the necessary compliance routines and draft the relevant forms to test out th
defaulte likely burdens that will be imposed and how easy it will be to comply. 
default&#xa0;
default16
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt should be borne in mind that it can be more cost-effective in some cases for the central authority to carry out aspects of the administration on a central basis, rather than devo
defaultlve the work to taxpayers. That said, we accept that in transaction taxes, those taxpayers who are liable should expect to shoulder most of the compliance burden.
default&#xa0;
default17
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOne issue to consider under this heading is the place of digital procedures. In general we s
defaultupport the idea of ‘digital by default’: that in today’s environment, digital communication (e
default-
defaultfiling, online intelligent forms, information being available on line etc) should be the norm. But it should not be compulsory: regard must be had to the 
default‘digitally excluded’. LITRG has a particular interest in this area
default. This is not solely an issue for individuals; many small businesses still rely on ‘traditional’ methods. In developing tax laws, the 
defaultWelsh
default Government needs to have regard to how these grou
defaultps should be catered for. 
default&#xa0;defaultSome comments on defaultWelsh defaulttax proposalsdefault&#xa0;default18
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA substantial part of the draft Wales Bill covers taxation powers. The taxes to be devolved to the Welsh Government are as devolved to Scotland and follow from the 
defaultSilk Commission proposals
default. The CIOT made submissions to the Silk Commission and we support the ways in which these proposals have been developed. 
defaultWelsh rate of income taxdefault&#xa0;
default19
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe decision to allow the Welsh Government a single rate of income tax rather than the varied rates as sugge
defaultsted by the Silk report introduces the same system as in Scotland. Although this is clearly a very important matter of principle, we think the real work now has to start in terms of how the tax will actually be managed and collected. From our work over the
default Scottish rate of income tax (SRIT), we think that key issues are:
default&#xa0;
default20
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe proposals in new s116D-G of the Governance of Wales Act 2006 parallel the equivalent Scottish provisions for defining who is liable to the new tax and correctly build on the new UK S
defaulttatutory Residence Test. The aim has to be that the vast majority of people can easily ascertain whether they will be Welsh taxpayers (or not) and are sure of their position. Work will be needed over practical issues, such as people who travel regularly be
defaulttween Wales and Eng
defaultland for work
default. 
default&#xa0;
default21
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere has been constructive engagement with HMRC over various technical matters relating to SRIT.
default Not all are fully resolved. Examples include tax relief for pension contributions and gift aid donations, and such matters as PAYE settlement agreements. We think it is important that rules and practices for the Welsh and Scottish rates on income tax are 
defaultin step: it would be administratively inefficient – as well as confusing for some taxpayers and employers – if there were definitional differences
default. 
default&#xa0;
default22
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA major issue that needs to be tackled is that of communication: making sure the right messages are convey
defaulted to taxpayers. Taxpayers may easily have a variety of misconceptions about the implications of the new tax system. As implementation approaches, there needs to be a carefully designed programme of communication to taxpayers explaining who is affected, th
defaulteir responsi
defaultbilities and the implications, 
defaultplus of course how to get additional help and explanations. This will need proper resourcing.
default&#xa0;
default23
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe have regularly pointed out the need to consider demands on employers (and pension providers)
default in tax changes
default. A key 
defaultexample is the extent to which employers will need to give information about 
defaultWelsh 
defaulttax on payslips: the point being that plenty of time needs to be allowed for employers and software suppliers to develop necessary systems
default. 
defaultIt needs to be borne in mind that
default it will not just be Welsh businesses that will have to operate the Welsh rate of income tax.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultDevolving Stamp Duty Land Taxdefault&#xa0;default24
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultConsideration should be given to adopting a progressive rate system
default for the successor Welsh 
defaulttax to
default remove the market distortions c
defaultreated by the current 
defaultSDLT 
default‘slab’ system. In the context of the residential property market, the effect of the SDLT ‘slab’ system (under which the rate of SDLT applies to the whole consideration once a threshold is reached) is widely recognised as creating
default market distortions with bunching around the price thresholds
default and creating
default avoidance
default opportunities
default (see the case of 
defaultOrsman
default v HMRC
default in 2012, where an allocation of just £800 to garage fittings was enough to reduce the SDLT by £5,200)
default.
default&#xa0;
default25
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn order to minimise uncertainty, particularly in the commercial property market, it is important that any inevitable uncertainty over likely future 
defaultdesign and 
defaultrates of 
defaultthe new tax
default is kept to a minimum. 
defaultThis includes the approach to anti-avoidance rules wh
defaultere there will need to be a balance struck between the desire to guard against avoidance and creating complex rules and uncertainty. 
defaultDelays in doing so may lead to investment decisions being delayed or directed elsewhere.
default&#xa0;
default26
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are challenging and problem
defaultatic aspects of SDLT such as the provisions relating to leases, partnerships and trusts. In designing 
defaultthe new tax
default, the
defaultre is a clear 
defaultopportunity to consult on simplifying the complex aspects of SDLT. We think it is important that sufficient time is built in
defaultto the legislative timetable to allow for consultation. 
default&#xa0;default27
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthe current SDLT online return is overly complex and inflexible to change. Registers of Scotland are currently developing a simplified online Land and Buildings Transaction Tax return. The Welsh Gov
defaulternment may wish to consider a similar approach. Irrespective of the arrangements adopte
defaultd
default for collection of devolved taxes, the costs of administration, at least in the longer term, should be reduced if the Welsh Government can construct a less complex tax
default than its SDLT predecessor with a simplified online return.
default&#xa0;
defaultWelsh Landfill taxdefault&#xa0;default28
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA key aim must be to tax what is actually discarded into landfill, not simply what enters the site. The tax structure needs to encourage recycling.
defaultRevenue Wales and a defaultTax defaultManagement Billdefault&#xa0;default29
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA significant matter is how the new taxes are run: a separate tax authority or by HMRC as agent for the Welsh Government. We assume the former will be the case, thus an organisation parallel to Revenue Scotland will need to be established.
default That will take time and resource.
default&#xa0;
default30
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe
defaultre will also be a need to 
defaultdevelop a taxes management system that can cover all the taxes likely to be devolved to 
defaultWales
default. Ideally tax management provisions should 
defaultbe common across all taxes, with difference only where 
defaultthe nature of the tax requires differences.
default&#xa0;
defaultHow the CIOT can contributedefault&#xa0;default31
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBoth the CIOT and LITRG operate across the UK
default with an extensive and active branch network including 
defaultour
default South Wales Branch. 
defaultWe employ 
defaulta number of Technical Officers 
defaultwho coordinate 
defaultand distil input from around 300 of our members who volunteer their time on our various technical committees
default. 
defaultMany more of our members volunteer their time to help with Education, Branches and Professional Standards activities. 
default&#xa0;
default32
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOur contributions to consu
defaultltations and general discussions therefore draw on the knowledge and experience of both our members in practice and the in-house technical team. With LITRG we have many links to wider groups who have an interest in tax matters. 
default&#xa0;
default33
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe CIOT has had significa
defaultnt involvement with the development of the Scottish tax system and would be able to draw on that experience in contributing to the development of Welsh tax proposals. Submissions that we have made on Scottish tax proposals have regularly drawn on surveys o
defaultf our members in practice in Scotland. We have also used mediums such as round tables, conference sessions, webinars and articles in 
defaultTax Adviser 
defaultmagazine to disseminate information and discuss issues. We would be pleased to work with 
defaultthe Welsh Government
default t
defaulto make use of these avenues to discuss tax matters, particularly around practical implications of proposals
default.
