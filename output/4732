defaultQ126 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman: defaultGood
default 
defaultafternoon. Thank you very much for coming
default.
default I know you were sitting at the back for some of the last, which is pretty exhausting, but you can see how enthusiastic the Members of the Committee are to try to get ways through all of this.
default 
defaultThe session will last approximately 50 to 60 minutes. Members of the Committee with relevant interests will declare them now. Does anybody have any relevant interests? No. The session is on the record and is being webcast live and will be subsequently accessible via the parliamentary website. Witnesses will receive a transcript of the session to check and correct and this will be put on the public record in printed form and on the parliamentary website. To help the transcribers, please state your name and official title.
defaultChris Neal:default I am Chris Neal. I am a trustee of the British Youth Council. As part of that role, I am also the 
defaultUK
default’s representative at the European Youth Forum.
defaultRachel Wenstone:default Rachel Wenstone, Deputy President of the National Union of Students 
defaultUK
default.
defaultHushpreet Dhaliwal:default I am Hushpreet Dhaliwal. I am Chief Executive of the National Association of College and University Entrepreneurs.
defaultQ127 default&#xa0; 
defaultThedefault Chairman:default That sounds very impressive, all of you, and thank you very much for your time. I would like to invite the witnesses, individually, to make an opening statement if you wish to. You do not have to, but is there something burning that you want to say before we get into the question and answer session?
defaultChris Neal:default The BYC welcomes any attempts to address the issue of youth unemployment. Youth unemployment has been around for a number of years. Young people have been dramatically affected in the austerity period and I think it is great that the House of Lords are taking the opportunity to explore the idea, especially with the new direction around the European funding, the Erasmus programme, education and change in state education in the 
defaultUK
default. On behalf of BYC, I welcome this investigation into the issues.
defaultThe Chairman:default Thank you very much. Perhaps I ought to clarify the situation. We will be advising our Ministers on what should be done, what we think, and that is why we are doing this scrutiny. Our role is scrutiny.
defaultChris Neal:default That is fine.
defaultRachel Wenstone:default Looking at youth unemployment has been a new area of work for 
defaultthe 
defaultNUS in the past couple of years. We have taken on some serious pieces of research and some of the results of that research and reporting ha
defaultve 
defaultbeen quite frightening: the extent of youth unemployment, the feeling of disempowerment, disenfranchisement, the way that it stops young people progressing to the next stages of their life—moving out of the family home, for example—can have such a huge impact and the belief that young people have that the Government is not looking to solve this problem.
defaultIt is important to look beyond the headline numbers
default—
defaultfor example
default,
default at the differences between the unemployment rates of young black men in comparison to young white men, between disabled young people, between the progression rates for young women and also the regional disparity between employment and progression. Employment is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to youth unemployment. In reality there are lots of related issues such as underemployment, the shape of the jobs market, the ladder without the middle rungs that we describe, or the hourglass shape, and we need to look beyond just unemployment to underemployment and progression.
defaultFinally, it is so important—and I am so pleased that we are represented here today—to involve young people and students in the solutions to youth unemployment. Some of the solutions that the Government have proposed I do not think you would have young people proposing in a million years. So I think it is great to have the opportunity to make this representation.
defaultThe Chairman:default That is very kind of you, but I just say that the week before last a group of us went up to 
defaultLiverpool
default and spoke to unemployed people and we got fairly rough treatment in some cases. Tomorrow a group of us are going off to 
defaultBirmingham
default to do exactly the same. It was one of our Members who said, “What about youth? We have to find out what they really think rather than the people who run these organisations”.
defaultHushpreet Dhaliwal:default I do not have an opening statement so much as to reinforce that we perhaps come at this from a slightly different angle. We are an organisation that was launched by students four years ago and our focus is job creation through entrepreneurship and getting young people to set up businesses. We operate at 80 universities and 110 college campuses and it is all run by students and student networks.
defaultQ128 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default That sounds wonderful. Thank you. What do you think the impacts of youth unemployment on young people are and do you think that this issue affects particular types of young people more than others? Can we have quick snappy answers? I think most of us have some idea now after all these witness sessions, but could you answer that one please?
defaultChris Neal:default Young people face a number of challenges when they are unemployed. BYC did a consultation of between 800 and 1,000 young people recently, which we submitted direct to the European Commission as part of a process they did to engage with young people. As part of the consultation, we found five key things young people face when unemployed. They suffer mental health issues, depression, a feeling of worthlessness
default—
default“I have these skills to bring but I cannot give them to anybody because nobody will accept what I am looking for”. It also causes some issues at home; if you are living with your parents, it causes tension in households. Also under-support and things around debt, because you are unemployed, you are not earning an income, right through to drug and alcohol abuse and that feeling of worthlessness.
default 
defaultThe second point is that numbers of young people over time, different groups, have experienced unemployment in different ways. Rachel was talking about underemployment and there are a lot of young people who are qualified but cannot get the jobs that they are qualified to do. They are pushing those ones that are not as qualified out of the job market because they are fulfilling jobs that they are not qualified for.
defaultRachel Wenstone:default We did some research with students—the most privileged group of potentially unemployed young people—and even within that group there is anxiety and a high level of stress about finding a job, finding a well paid job and a job that matches their skill level. It is important to say that education is the silver bullet to lots of these issues in that if you have no qualifications unemployment is around 33% in comparison to 8% for graduates, but there is a big disparity within that. If you look at, for example, different types of graduates, those from Russell Group institutions are more likely to be able to access higher
default-
defaultskilled jobs than others. There is a stark difference even between no qualifications and the lowest level of qualifications. So for a young person with level 2 qualifications, five GCSEs, there is an unemployment rate of about 12%. That is compared to no qualifications of about 33%. Going through some level of education is very important.
defaultThe hourglass economy, the missing middle bit, means that often graduates are forced into underemployment, into lower
default-
defaultskilled jobs, and that forces those without qualifications out of the bottom of the economy and into unemployment. It is worth saying it has serious consequences for the future 
defaultUK
default jobs market when we lose highly skilled people to retirement in the next 30 years. There will not be people to replace those jobs and that is quite serious.
defaultIn terms of different types of unemployed people, half of young black men are unemployed in comparison to a fifth of young white men. I think that is something we should take really seriously. Disabled people are 30% more likely to be unemployed and young women are more likely to be in employment but often stagnate at the lowest level of pay on the lower skill level. I think these are very serious issues.
defaultHushpreet Dhaliwal:default There are a couple of things here that are really different 
defaultfrom 
defaultunemployment in comparison to the way it has been in previous years or previous decades. One of the key things at the moment among graduates is that there are 115,000 graduates now who have been unemployed for in excess of two years. These people are not getting experience and training, and there is a bit of expectation management to do with the employers who are expecting people straight out of education or straight out of another job to join their workforce. They are not calling in people for interviews who are not employed or are underemployed for the best part of two years and that is a problem. There is expectation management to do there.
defaultI think the big issue
default,
default though
default,
default is mismanagement of aspiration. There is real lack of understanding among this generation and some serious confusion of the opportunities that exist for them in career planning and ending up in a job. Every year the FE sector generates more hairdressers than there are currently hairdressers. It absolutely does not make any sense. We are not giving the right advice when trying to negotiate with a young individual and deciding on their career path. A plumbing job today could get you £70,000 a year; £70,000 a year you could earn being a plumber.
defaultThe Chairman:default From plumbing?
defaultHushpreet Dhaliwal:default Absolutely, and yet we have a deficit of those skills in the marketplace because we are not managing that. So there is that area.
defaultWhen I look at the people who are most at risk it is probably those who are in training for jobs that do not exist or jobs that will not exist going forward. It is those who are on an educational track that is tied to attainment of education versus skills and training. The idea still that individuals with degree-based education get preference over those 
defaultwho 
defaultcome out of colleges and so on is a big problem. There is a cultural shift that the 
defaultUK
default needs to undertake in understanding that training via other means is just as valuable for the kind of economy we are building.
defaultThe other thing that I would point out is, of course, regional. There is a deficit of opportunity depending on where you are raised, access to opportunity if you are born in certain parts of the 
defaultUK
default versus others or have access to certain parts of education versus others.
defaultThe Chairman:default Thank you. That has been well researched. Did you want add something?
defaultRachel Wenstone:default Yes. I disagree with the idea that students and young people are training for the wrong jobs. The diversity in the amount and types of education that people are coming into the labour market with is far greater than the diversity within the labour market itself. Young people are presenting the labour market with a high level of skills in different areas and the labour market is not reacting. One area where it has reacted is the creative arts industry. 
defaultTen 
defaultyears ago people reacted to so-called Mickey Mouse degrees and these are the degrees that are now going on to make this recession-busting industry. I think we have to be careful about fixing—
defaultThe Chairman:default Type casting.
defaultRachel Wenstone:default Also fixing education for the labour market when the labour market is not moving around different types of education. Ultimately it is give and take; it is not one way or the other.
defaultHushpreet Dhaliwal:default It is give and take, yes, both ways.
defaultThe Chairman:default Does anyone want to join in on this? I shall move to the next question.
defaultQ129 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Freeman:default The public sector, whether it is the British Government or the European Union, ha
defaults 
defaulta whole number of initiatives. I have two very simple questions. Which initiatives are the most effective, in your judgment, and to what extent are young people aware of the most effective initiatives?
defaultChris Neal:default We welcome any measures 
defaultthat 
defaultGovernments in the 
defaultUK
default or the European Union decide to implement to support young people. BYC has not undertaken great research into this area. My personal perspective of it is that the most effective systems are the ones that engage with young people. If you can engage with young people, they want to engage and they want to participate and they become very active in what they are doing. If you say, “This is what you are going to do, get on with it”, it is not going to happen. What you need to say is, “As a partnership agreement, what do we need to do? What is the end goal? What are we trying to achieve together?” I think there is great stuff; the youth contract is a way forward to do that. There is the development of the Erasmus programme moving into the next budgetary period. There are some great ideas and I think it is how you promote to young people as well.
defaultThere is stuff around formal education
default and the view that 
defaultthe way forward is that all young people will engage with a formal education. That is not right. Some people go to colleges, some people are out of the education sector, and it is how you get to those groups outside of the education sector to promote the resources to. It is okay targeting the normal channels, but we need to start to think differently and outside of those normal channels to engage with young people who get lost in the system.
defaultRachel Wenstone:default We agree with the idea of the youth contract and the principle of it. What has really worried us is the take-up of the youth contract. I think there has to be greater engagement from universities and colleges with employers as opposed to expecting employers to be able to reach out to young people and young people to know where those opportunities are.
defaultWith the work programme, however, I have real concerns with a programme that forces a young person to languish in unemployment and take 
defaultjobseeker’s allowance 
defaultbefore help is available to them. Where young people are asked to create the solutions to youth unemployment they probably would not say that forcing them to be unemployed for nine months first would be the solution. That is where it becomes very obvious that we need to engage with young people more.
defaultThe information, advice and guidance available to young people 
defaultare 
defaultabsolutely atrocious. When the Government cut Aimhigher and Connexions
default,
default they cut a lifeline to many young people. We know, for example, that those people graduating from further education rely much more on their social networks and their local connections to find work. That means that they are relying on locally available work, on the social capital that comes with that and on the perceptions and expectations of them that exist. They are not looking beyond the opportunities available to them.
defaultOf course, not having centrally funded, centrally administered information, advice and guidance to young people means that you are relying on schools and colleges to provide that. It is often underfunded and undertrained. It comes with people’s own perceptions of what is right and wrong. There are all sorts of things that force schools to make different decisions
default. For 
defaultexample
default,
default you have schools deciding to push people towards higher education because they get moved up in the league table because of that. You do not get moved up the league table if you go into an apprenticeship, even if it is a high level apprenticeship, so there are difficulties there.
defaultFor the opportunities available through 
defaultEurope
default, again it is an issue of information, advice and guidance. We send half the number of students that we take in on the Erasmus programme. There are all sorts of issues about what is expected of you when you go to 
defaultEurope
default. Lots of people think that they need a second language, when you do not, and language provision in schools, particularly in poorer areas, is often awful, so again that comes with all sorts of social barriers. Ultimately 
defaultj
defaultobcentres and careers advisers are not set up to give people the opportunities available to them in Europe, which is a great shame because there are an awful lot of young people losing out on opportunities available to them.
defaultThe Chairman:default Do you have anything to add to that?
defaultHushpreet Dhaliwal:default Only to reinforce that I think a lot of support and guidance that is received by young people is based on the competencies of local infrastructure, like Jobcentre Plus and other delivery bodies, and that is a real problem. When we speak to our network, there are real disparities between individuals. Certain universities and colleges have a clear understanding of what programmes like Erasmus expect of them versus another. That is not even just on the student side; it is also on the SME side. We speak to SMEs who say, “We do not understand how to engage with things like work incentives”.
defaultChris Neal:default Can I add one further point? The education maintenance allowance was almost a backbone for young people to go, “Okay, I have reached 16. I am going to leave formal education. I might not want to then get a job. I want to go and study”. For some young people, great, it still exists. For wider than that it is terrible for young people to think, “I do not want to leave education but I feel I have to leave education because my family background, social background, cannot keep me in that place”. I think there is something about how that could address the issue of unemployment and giving young people the security while they continue to develop their skills for employment.
defaultQ130 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default Yes, I am sure. How useful do 
defaultyou
default think EURES is, or have y
defaultou
default come across it?
defaultRachel Wenstone:default We would have to ask our members, but I doubt very much they have come across it. We had an anecdote from a member of our staff who went into a Jobcentre and asked for the EURES programme. The adviser had to go and ask her manager because she had never heard of it. We would have to ask our members
default,
default but the likelihood is that they have never heard of it.
defaultChris Neal:default I had not heard of it in the four years of working with the European Union.
defaultThe Chairman:default Would we be wrong to come to the conclusion that there is so much on offer but it is not co
default-
defaultordinated in a way that is getting the people into employment?
defaultRachel Wenstone:default I agree, but I do think there is also recognition of the underlying structural and stereotypical barriers that stop people from accessing those things. You have to have a certain amount of confidence and family support to think that you can go and move country, and that needs to be considered. It is not just a matter of information and availability of that information. It is about the financial support and confidence that comes with that.
defaultChris Neal:default I think the concept is great, delivery is poor, and there is a need for some sort of portal of information that is youth friendly, whether it covers work experience, employment opportunities, paid internships. A central portal that young people know they can get to and it is communicated clearly would be quite a good resource.
defaultThe Chairman:default There is a huge job for entrepreneurial youngsters to set that portal up. How about it?
defaultHushpreet Dhaliwal:default Also a huge job, because of course Government over the last five years has tried to set up all sorts of websites that act as hubs and portals. It is a massive undertaking. What we really need is local ownership of that issue.
defaultThe Chairman:default I do not think we are going to get involved with Government and its successes and failures in IT.
defaultQ131 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Clinton-Davis:default In your view, do young people have sufficient say in whether the measures that are designed to support them are effectively engineered?
defaultRachel Wenstone:default I would say not at all, and it is probably as simple as that.
defaultThe Chairman:default You have never been asked?
defaultRachel Wenstone:default The fact that this is a new area of work for the National Union of Students speaks volumes. We have been talking about education for an awfully long time. If we did not start talking about youth unemployment, I think we would have to reassess what our purpose was.
defaultUltimately a great example where young people are not asked is with apprenticeships. We have thousands of young people taking on apprenticeships at all levels. We were pleased to see in a recent BIS report that they expected more young people to be taking on apprenticeships to be spoken to
default,
default to set up some sort of democratic representative structure, and we have begun to do that. No, absolutely not, young people are not asked what the solution should be.
defaultLord Clinton-Davis:default What is their reaction?
defaultThe Chairman:default You are being asked now.
defaultRachel Wenstone:default Yes, and we are very pleased for that.
defaultLord Clinton-Davis:default What is their reaction?
defaultRachel Wenstone:default It is interesting, having started to do this research. They tell us how important the balance between on
default-
defaultthe
default-
defaultjob and off
default-
defaultthe
default-
defaultjob work is in apprenticeships. Again, we begin to understand what makes a quality apprenticeship in a way that we have never had insight 
defaultinto 
defaultbefore. We understand 
defaultthat 
defaultthe quality and length of training, their ability to advocate their own skills, and the ability to advocate on behalf of themselves 
defaultare 
defaultreally important but we have never known that before because we never had that conversation.
defaultQ132 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default Does the NUS recruit apprentices?
defaultRachel Wenstone:default Yes, we do, and we have one of our first apprentice sabbatical officers in 
defaultWales
default at the moment, which is exciting.
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default What facility do you have for following people who graduate and then do not get jobs?
defaultRachel Wenstone:default This is the area of work that we are looking into at the moment. We have done a big report with the New Economics Foundation into youth unemployment. In reality we have to go back and do more, but this report talks about the shape of the labour market, the regional disparity, and also looks at different types of qualifications. I think what is quite important is that often people come to the youth unemployment question as 
defaultbeing about 
defaultno qualifications and graduate unemployment, 
defaultbut 
defaultin reality there is a big swath
defaulte
default of other people 
defaultwho 
defaultare not being reached.
defaultQ133 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default I think what is said about young people going on to the market is that they are not sufficiently trained or do not have the right attitude, and some of that is just anecdotal. Is that right? If there is anything to it, what is there that should be done about it?
defaultChris Neal:default Can I add a point to the previous question? I did not catch your eye, sorry. I tend to disagree slightly. I think the Government is intending to try to listen to more young people but not on key policy areas, say through the Positive for Youth policy area. There is some great work going on with the Cabinet Office or the Department for Education, but the Department for Work 
defaultand 
defaultPensions do not engage with young people. There is a huge amount of work and there is a bit of disparity. Within 
defaultg
defaultovernment, where does youth policy sit? Where does youth actually sit? Does it sit in the Cabinet Office, the Department for Education? Where should it be? It has got lost in the mirage of 
defaultg
defaultovernment to the detriment of young people.
defaultThe Chairman:default You are not unique in thinking that. I asked myself what Cabinet Ministers 
defaultwe 
defaultshould have. There is BIS, the Department 
defaultfor 
defaultWork 
defaultand 
defaultPensions, the Treasury and the Department for Education, and they all have responsibility. It is what I should not call, but I do call, silo management. The problem is we are not talking about the things in silos like grain; we are talking about people’s futures, careers and well
default-
defaultbeing. It is something we have to do something about.
defaultChris Neal:default It is not just about people. It is about the future of the British economy, if you invest in young people today.
defaultThe Chairman:default But it is people first.
defaultChris Neal:default Of course. If you invest in young people today they are 100% of the future.
defaultThe Chairman:default Exactly right.
defaultQ134 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default Would it be helpful if I repeated 
defaultthe question
default?
defaultThe Chairman:default Yes, sorry about that.
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default 
defaultIt is about s
defaultkills and attitude, those two things. Are skills adequate; are attitudes right? Some people say they are not. Do you agree? If there is anything to that, what could be done about it?
defaultRachel Wenstone:default I think the idea that young people are underskilled and lazy and some of the narratives around that is categorically false. I think it is quite dangerous in how it sets up the employer and employee relationship. We have the evidence to prove it. We did a piece of research with GTI Media and Step and asked small employers about their experience with graduates
default:
default 82% of small employers were happy or very happy with the graduates they had taken on and half the respondents said that graduates were better than they were five years ago. So it is not true. It is not to say that there are not serious issues. There are not the jobs out there and ultimately there are not the jobs for the skilled graduates in the market, so it is not a skills deficit, it is a jobs quality deficit. I think that is important to emphasise.
defaultAt the moment it feels like the responsibility only flows in one direction. It flows from the student, it is the student’s responsibility, it is the young person’s responsibility to be work ready. 
defaultTwenty 
defaultyears ago these people were not ultimately work ready but there was an expectation that they went in at mid-level jobs, they would be trained in the job, they would understand the cultures of the workplace and they would become work ready. To expect young people to present themselves on the first day of work, or even before that at an interview stage—and there 
defaultis 
defaultall sorts of cultural norming as well that go
defaultes
default on around that, around the expectation of how young people dress or speak, the background that they come from, the social capital that they bring with them. We need to be quite explicit about tackling some of those stereotypes and cultures if we are going to tackle these issues.
defaultThere 
defaultis 
defaulta group of young people 
defaultwho 
defaultlack training. They are the group of people that Chris was talking about, those people who have been unable to stay in training because of the lack of support financially through the education maintenance allowance and so on. It is not to say that everybody is work ready, but ultimately again they have been let down by the system. 
defaultChris Nealdefault: I think it is quite a bad situation when employers have a monopoly on young people. Young people cannot defend themselves when there are 100 young people applying for one job from an employer. It is hard for young people to go to a job interview. For example, my personal experience is that I finished uni and I was out of work for eight months. I went to jobs, got interviews and was told, “Sorry, you are underqualified. Sorry, you are overqualified”. It is that balance, that I do not have the experience or the knowledge or whatever that employer is looking for, which they can use as an excuse not to employ you. 
defaultI think a lot of young people have the right skills but, 
defaultas 
defaultwe said earlier about underemployment, they are working in jobs they are not trained for. They do not have the education to support them. Only in November the UK Youth Parliament sat in the House of Commons and they were talking about the curriculum for life. Young people want an education that prepares them for employment and work and real life. This is the second year that they have talked about it and discussed it and debated on it. There is a campaign running now in the Youth Parliament about 
defaultthe fact 
defaultthat young people want to get engaged in education and they want education that will develop their skills to go out into the economy in the future whatever it looks like, whether it is green jobs, infrastructure jobs, IT jobs. They will be ready and prepared to go into employment. 
defaultAs 
defaultRachel said, there is a small group of young people who do not have the skills
default,
default but that is a very tiny minority. Many young people want to get out there and work and contribute to society. 
defaultHushpreet Dhaliwaldefault: In terms of attitudes, certainly not. In the light of this statement, our group are incredibly enterprising, incredibly fierce and completely aware of what the job market looks like, and so they are trying to get as many experiences under their belt as they can at a very young age to make sure that they are work ready. At the 
defaultRoyal
default 
defaultAgricultural
default 
defaultCollege
default some guys are running a business that bottles and distributes local beer. They have just expanded to jams and chutneys and they employ students on campus to run that business, to market it and sell it across the country. At 
defaultBarking &amp; Dagenham
default 
defaultCollege
default you have 16, 17, 18
default 
defaultyear-olds 
defaultwho 
defaultrun an on-campus business that generates £110,000 a year. They save the college £60,000 in procurement costs. These are young people who recognise that they have to do more than just 
defaultfollow 
defaulttheir mainstream education tracks and try to find other opportunities for development. 
defaultIn terms of attitudes, absolutely not. In terms of skills, to a degree I can empathise. I can empathise with employers because, 
defaultas 
defaultto Rachel’s point, if those mid-tier jobs are gone
default,
default that means there are a whole raft of young people going to jobs where there are currently no training schemes and programmes to get them work ready as there would have been traditionally. Today 47% of graduates are in non-graduate jobs
default—
defaulthalf our graduates. That means that they are going into work placements or the world of work where they do not already have programmes set up that will take them through that two, three, four-month journey to get them ready to then deliver value to that business. We really have to talk about who the employers
default are.
default 
defaultIf 
defaultmore of those employers are looking like SMEs and small businesses
default,
default then we have to start asking the question: who owns the runway to get the young individual work ready and able to add value to that business? 
defaultRachel Wenstonedefault: I think that some employers are taking advantage of the fact that these middle jobs do not exist any more. You have an increase in unpaid internships where people are expected to work for a year or two years without pay and other examples of really exploitative, I would say, work regimes but it is not work because you are not being paid for it. I think you are right that it is important to look to small and medium businesses to fill that gap because so far we have seen big employers just take advantage of that gap. 
defaultQ135 default&#xa0; 
defaultBaroness Valentine:default I should probably declare at this point that 
defaultwhen I am not here 
defaultI am Chief Executive of London First, which is a business-sponsored organisation. I recognise a lot of what you are saying from the point of view of how it feels for those seeking employment, but if you look at inner London, which has 25% unemployment, and we have whatever economy we have at the moment, if there is only one for every 100 applicants then there is only one job for every 100 applicants. I am trying to get under the skin of what you are saying. I certainly recognise employers saying that the people they employ do not turn up for work on time and do not seem to be applying themselves to the job in hand. There are lot of leisure and hospitality jobs in 
defaultLondon
default but typically they do not go to Londoners. They go to the people coming through 
defaultLondon
default. Can you give a little bit more feel as to what is going on with this? Certainly the employers would say a graduate immigrant from 
defaultPoland
default will be more work ready than a non-graduate Londoner.
defaultRachel Wenstonedefault: I think we have to pick apart what we mean by work ready. It is one thing if you are talking about the skills, aptitude and ability to take on that task. If you are talking about the willingness to work on poverty pay, below London living wage for example, and take on a task that you are overqualified for when you have been promised, “Stay in education, get a degree, get a good qualification, you will go and get a good job”, that is something quite different. 
defaultBaroness Valentine:default But at the moment there are not all those jobs that we would like to have for those sorts of people. 
defaultRachel Wenstonedefault: No, but then I find it quite difficult to have the conversation that students and graduates and unemployed young people are not ready to work if the jobs just do not exist. We are asking young people to be more competitive, to take on experience, often unpaid, to do more and more and more, and compete and compete and compete to get the jobs available, but those jobs are not available in the first place. We are almost lying to young people twice. We are saying, “Stay in education and you will get a job, and while you are there you need to work harder and harder and harder, and we promise you will get something”. 
defaultBaronessdefault Valentine:default There are obviously different types of jobs that we are talking about, so there are a lot of leisure and hospitality jobs that you might regard as poorly paid and therefore not appropriate for the graduates that are becoming available. If in practice we have that mismatch, I am not quite sure where we are going with that conversation. 
defaultRachel Wenstonedefault: Then I think the labour market has to react better to the types of education and skills that people have. Your organisation is a key example of where that exists. The creative arts industry is the perfect example where people were quite snobby towards Mickey Mouse, new media, creative arts type degrees and yet computer technology, for example, and games technology is vast and it is growing on a day-to-day basis. We are world leading in computer games technology. Ultimately the labour market has to do more to react to the skills that graduates and young people are coming out with as opposed to expecting young people to just take the work that is available. Our jobs market will stagnate and go backwards 20 years as opposed to moving forward and creating new industries and innovative ways of creating employment. 
defaultChris Nealdefault: 
defaultOn s
defaultomething that Rachel was saying
default, 
defaultit is about the national minimum wage. Most young people fall out of the national minimum wage. You are expecting young people, as you say, to continue to devote their life to education
default and to 
defaultwork hard and they will get a good job. We are lying to young people. Apprenticeships are about £2, £3 an hour. That will pay for their travel and food for the day. What is the point of them putting their effort into an apprenticeship and going to that apprenticeship and getting paid a wage that they cannot live on? 
defaultHushpreet Dhaliwaldefault: If I can answer your question from a slightly different angle
default, one 
defaultin four graduates post
default-
defaultuniversity flock to 
defaultLondon
default.
defaultThe Chairman:default Is that 
defaultUK
default graduates? 
defaultHushpreet Dhaliwaldefault: 
defaultUK
default graduates. That is why youth unemployment in the capital is so hard to shift, because we have young people leaving Leeds or 
defaultHuddersfield
default and thinking that the opportunity lies in the capital. To speak to Lord Heseltine’s point of view, we need to be able to create local jobs. We need to be able to bring transparency to the local economy of the jobs and opportunities that exist. 
defaultOne of the things we are doing is taking the careers fair concept and touring it around the country and doing the alternative careers fair where we bring SMEs on to campuses. BIS did an excellent review of this, that SMEs are quite timid about the idea of coming on to campus and displaying themselves as a place where young people can launch their careers. On the other side of it, graduates think that SMEs are not the place that they should be launching their careers and instead they get jobs where they are underemployed and wait another year for the milk run to come round. What we need is for people to stay in Leeds and 
defaultHuddersfield
default, create value locally, either by starting a business or joining local small firms. 
defaultQ136 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default I think we have had one answer to this already, but do you think support is available to young people at the moment that enables them to make a successful transition from school, and I think I will add to that university also, through to a good job and a career? Rachel said earlier it was atrocious, so she has given an answer already. If she has, could she tell us then what in fact should be happening to put the problem in its proper context? Following that through so that Hushpreet can come in with it too, do you think that being an entrepreneur is an achievable career option for young people? How could the 
defaultUK
default or the EU work to help young people to fund and start up their own companies and go into business on their own? There are two questions there, please. 
defaultRachel Wenstonedefault: I think to bring back centrally organised careers advice, to bring back Aimhigher and Connexions. It is fascinating when you talk to universities now, dealing with the deficit in careers advice in schools, the answer they will always give is, “What we need is some sort of regional or nationally funded careers adviser”, and we had that. I think honestly the only solution really is to bring back what we had, Aimhigher and Connexions, but there is a regional point as well. For example, the universities in 
defaultLiverpool
default have worked very well together to keep graduates in the city and to provide them 
defaultwith 
defaultopportunities, and for them to understand the opportunities that are available to them. There is the need for a national careers advice framework, information, advice and guidance, but what institutions, colleges and universities can do with local authorities to keep young people in the local area and create employment I think is huge. 
defaultThere is a point I have to make, and it links to the question before. Most graduates in our research said that they would like to work for the public sector because of the job progression, the pay and the security. Places like 
defaultNewcastle
default, for example, used to have two
default&#x2011;
defaultthirds of its job opportunities via the public sector, which no longer exists. It is no wonder that people are looking to move out of those areas if the jobs simply do not exist. 
defaultLiverpool
default 
defaultUniversity
default is a good example of where they work together with colleges and the local authority to create those opportunities. 
defaultHushpreet Dhaliwaldefault: No, there is not a clear pathway and the problem is that schools, colleges and universities are incredibly disconnected. It is a very disconnected journey for a young individual. We are entering an era of lifelong learning where people are constantly going to have to skill up and top up. Every couple of years our skills sets are going to become outdated in parallel to the changes in technology and what is happening and the way that global talent will compete. We are just not set up to respond to that. The greatest disconnect is that journey for a young individual who is trying to map and route their career and does not quite understand where those opportunities lie. 
defaultOne of the best things that we could probably do about that is start speaking to the LEPs about creating local boards. When we start talking about things like student voice, every single LEP should have a student or youth board that helps guide their enterprise programmes and development of their enterprise programmes. Every single LEP needs to have a youth entrepreneurship strategy, absolutely. We also need to task local organisations to start acting as conduits and the hubs for local support. This is not about building heavy national infrastructure programmes. This is about well done dissemination locally, and that really varies per region, per county and being responsive to that. 
defaultChris Nealdefault: From our perspective, the simple answer is no. We consulted 500,000 young people—we are willing to share the report with the Committee—and after a curriculum for life that prepares young people, they told us careers advice and work experience 
defaultare 
defaulta very shoddy, ad hoc approach across the country, and young people are falling through the cracks because the right support and advice when they need it is not there. 
defaultRachel Wenstonedefault: To add on that as well, it is worth saying that there is one remaining national careers adviser and that is Inspiring the Future, which promotes apprenticeships, and that is doing good work. It is important to promote and fund that further if we are going to be serious about balancing the opportunities that are available to young people. So there is one that still exists. 
defaultQ137 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default Thank you. Do you have any links with similar organisations in 
defaultEurope
default so that you can get some experience about what kind of guidance and careers assistance they get? 
defaultRachel Wenstonedefault: Yes. We are a member of the European Students Union. We join about 40-odd other national student unions there, and it is something we can ask them to get back to us on. 
defaultChris Nealdefault: We work with around 40 other national councils across 
defaultEurope
default and with the European Students Union, as well as other international student bodies, so we can ask that question as well if that is needed. 
defaultHushpreet Dhaliwaldefault: We have set up an organisation to mentor 20 other nations on how to create a NACUE-like student-led model in their countries, and we are happy to do that. In terms of international comparisons, 
defaultUK
default students, according to GUESS surveys, have the most favourable attitudes to setting up businesses. There is something that is really happening when you get a cohort of young people who are saying they are pro the idea of starting a business but then it does not come through because they do not have enough support networks, once they engage with the idea of setting up, to launch and establish a business.
defaultQ138 default&#xa0; 
defaultEarl of Liverpool:default Given the fast pace of change in ICT and technology generally, what opportunities or problems do you think that brings to young people as they try to make the transition from education into work? 
defaultChris Nealdefault: I think the issue does not lie with young people. I think it lies with society, 
defaultg
defaultovernment, business to adapt. Young people engage with social change. You saw the development of mobile phones, tablet computers, wireless internet; the world is changing and young people stay engaged with it. I think big institutions like 
defaultg
defaultovernment do not actually develop and change. Like I said before, if you stay engaged with young people and understand where they are coming from and the society that they are around in
default,
default it can work. There is also a need for education to develop and change. There is no point teaching young people the abacus when they can use a calculator, and society has changed. We need to keep changing in line with technology and I do not think that all just lies with young people. 
defaultQ139 default&#xa0; 
defaultThedefault Chairman:default Can I interject here? It is striking that in all our evidence—and we have not asked the questions, but the only time IT was mentioned today was about the gaming industry, and yet we are told at European level that there is a huge problem developing in terms of globalisation skills in Malaysia, Korea, China and so on, and we do not seem to have cottoned on. Everybody around this table has a computer and we think we are computer literate. I remember at one of the conferences we went to one of the countries that has a presidency—I cannot remember which—said that if every person in youth unemployment in that country just developed better IT skills there would be jobs for them. What are you, as youth, trying to do to encourage people to be the Steve Jobs and Bill Gates of 10 years hence? 
defaultRachel Wenstonedefault: We run a project called Changing the Learning Landscape, which is about the use of technology in learning and in the curriculum, and it has a high take-up from our student unions. The pushback is their institutions who will not react quick
defaultly
default enough to deal with some of the changes in technology. There are some great examples, such as at university where students are able to do chemical experiments online. They can do group work in between theory and practical work, so they are not wasting materials, and they are able to start to change the way 
defaultin which 
defaultthey learn through technology, but the take-up has been slow from institutions. If you look at the web portals for most universities, they are embarrassing in comparison to what we would expect from businesses. 
defaultThe Chairman:default Universities
default?
default 
defaultRachel Wenstonedefault: Yes, and what we would expect from people every day. A good example of the way that we talk about IT proficiency is the question on a job application, “Are you IT proficient?” You used to be able to show that through a qualification. Now I think for most young people filling in that job application it would be more the question, “What do you mean by this? Can I use a word processor? Yes, of course I can, but what else?” So 
defaultthere should be an 
defaultunderstanding of that. There is a point that links to what you said before about this 
defaultbeing 
defaultan issue of retraining and reskilling and the opportunity for lifelong learning that comes with that, but also recognition that there are young people out there who do not have access to educational equipment at a very young age
default—young people
default in rural areas 
defaultwho 
defaultdo not have access to the internet
default,
default for example. I suppose it cannot be taken as a given that young people have access to those things. I think that the structures that they work in are normally more hesitant to react to these things than the young people themselves are. 
defaultHushpreet Dhaliwaldefault: I agree with the point that Rachel has just made. There has been a balancing out of opportunity because there are young people carrying around 3G phones more than there ever has been. You have an interface that you can engage with to prevent people dropping out of the system and that is something that we need to begin to utilise better. The other interesting thing is that I was recently talking to a careers department and they were questioning what their role now is in the age of more self-education. In an age where any young person can access as much as they want about absolutely anything they want in relation to their careers and career planning, what does that then mean the role of the institution is? It is pretty concerning that there are those kinds of questions happening at the careers department end of it, because young people need guidance. There is a whole raft of programmes that are not suitable or 
defaultthat are 
defaultmisleading. There is a whole raft of opportunity and what young people need today more than ever is guidance about what is most appropriate. 
defaultThedefault Chairman:default Who is going to provide the guidance? 
defaultHushpreet Dhaliwaldefault: I think it needs to be institutions. Schools, colleges, universities are the local hubs that have touch points with these young people. They have to be the people 
defaultwho 
defaultsay, “No matter what you encounter out there in the world of work, whatever extracurricular opportunity you are engaging in, we are going to be your hub. We are going to be the institution that you reflect first as to whether or not it is right for you”. 
defaultChris Nealdefault: There is also a need to remember that not every young person is in some form of education where they have those touch points. To make them as successful as possible, there are youth centres
default or 
defaultcommunity centres where young people are involved in extracurricular activities such as the Scouts, Guides, whoever that body is, and they need to be accessible to young people and not just those in education. 
defaultQ140 default&#xa0; 
defaultBaroness Hooper:default The EURES network issue was raised earlier by the Lord Chairman since it is intended, in theory at least, to give young people contacts for jobs within the European Union. Do you think this is helping in giving opportunities? Can we improve on the communication about it, which seemed to be the problem? Do you think migration of labour is a help or hindrance? 
defaultRachel Wenstonedefault: I think it is a huge opportunity lost for most of our young people. You have people from the 
defaultc
defaultontinent who able to come here and train and skill and understand different work cultures and take those skills back to improve their labour forces and job markets, and our young people do not take up those opportunities. They do not take them up because they do not know about them, but they also do not take them up because of, as I said before, the social barriers that exist that stop people doing that, the confidence issues, the financial support, understanding that you have parents or guardians that will be there when you get lost in a foreign country to pick up the phone. There are real issues around the culture in the 
defaultUK
default of thinking that we do things best. There is an awful lot to learn from the 
defaultc
defaultontinent and it is something we should be proud to do and proud to support young people to do. But the first issue is that people just do not know about those opportunities. 
defaultChris Nealdefault: I fully agree. I had never heard of the Erasmus programme until I 
defaulthad 
defaultfinished university and had a job, so that is quite concerning. The idea, the concept is great. It is more 
defaultabout 
defaultdelivery. Is it something that young people can look at? Is it something that is detailed in text? Is it interactive? But also is there an opportunity to develop it further? Is there an opportunity to not just put jobs on there but develop it into a work experience portal, an internship, paid internships and, as I said before, create almost a hub for young people? If they are looking for something particular, they can use it to broaden their experiences overseas. Rachel is right. There are lot more young people who know about things like Erasmus overseas and coming to the 
defaultUK
default than 
defaultUK
default groups. There is an opportunity for organisations like BYC, NUS and other partners to be used to promote the opportunities that are out there, because we have networks of thousands of young people and young adults. We do not sometimes get the message to them in the right way and I think the message delivery needs to massively improve. 
defaultThe Chairman:default Did you want to add something? 
defaultHushpreet Dhaliwaldefault: Only that immigration largely, I think, is a good thing but we have to accept that, given the numbers of youth unemployment, we are starting off on a bit of a back foot. How do we get young people ready for what will be a more competitive market, a marketplace that they will learn from if they are given the opportunity to engage with it? 
defaultQ141 default&#xa0; 
defaultBaroness Hooper:default May I 
defaultask 
defaulta supplementary? I happen to know that the 
defaultUK
default quota of jobs in the European Commission is not filled by quite a large percentage because of the lack of language skills. I know you 
defaultsaid 
defaultearlier—I think it was Rachel—that that is not really an issue but I think it is, certainly for the better jobs and the more skilled jobs. Can you, as young people, do anything? I am certainly campaigning for more language teaching in schools and better levels of language teaching. Is there anything that you think you can do to fill that particular gap? 
defaultRachel Wenstonedefault: Often the provision of language skills 
defaultis 
defaultbetter in private and independent schools. If you are coming from a local state school, from an underprivileged area, the provision of language is not something that is seen as necessarily important or something that is prioritised. It has implications, of course, in the way that people engage with English. It is not just having to engage with foreign languages. I think if people understood the opportunities available to them outside the 
defaultUK
default more and that was ingrained at an earlier age, they may prioritise learning foreign languages. It is the point I made before, that the expectation that you must speak a foreign language well in order to take up an opportunity in Europe is not always necessarily the case for all of the opportunities available, and having that honest conversation with people about what is expected in order to be able to take up these opportunities and how you can help yourself do that through your education. 
defaultQ142 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default Thank you. Does any Member of the Committee have a burning question to ask? No? I want to ask one. What do you feel about zero
default-
defaulthours contracts? Do they help or hinder young people? One of the witnesses suggested that flexibility is helpful. We have also heard evidence to the contrary. 
defaultChris Nealdefault: Our members have not told us their views on that. My personal opinion is it can be balanced either way. I have been on a zero
default-
defaulthours contract. It was great because I had the flexibility, but also there was the insecurity of not knowing what I 
defaultwas 
defaultworking from one week to the next. I think for some young people it is great but there need to be some tighter controls around how they are managed and developed. It is not just about zero hours. It is about all the other rights that go with employment and young people need rights when they are in employment. 
defaultRachel Wenstonedefault: I agree. An exploitative employer is going to be an exploitative employer whether it is a zero
default-
defaulthour contract or not. They will find a way to get around that. I think zero
default-
defaulthour contracts create the basis for exploitation, and we have to be quite careful about that. Flexibility and listening to people’s needs and care and responsibilities, for example, is important in the workplace, but exploiting them and not giving them job security is not helpful. 
defaultHushpreet Dhaliwaldefault: Work experience in any form and some sort of positive engagement in work is a good thing, but it is a real problem when you operate on a zero
default-
defaulthours contract where you do not know from one day to the next when you are going to be called in. Young people cannot plan around that kind of short
default-
defaultnotice employment. 
defaultThe Chairman:default I do not think older people can either. 
defaultHushpreet Dhaliwaldefault: Sure, no, but it is about the ability to create value in other ways. They need to be able to know so that they can engage in voluntary opportunities or set up businesses. 
defaultQ143 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default Yes, indeed. You have been great witnesses, thank you very much, but would each one of you like to think of a question that we should have asked you and we did not? Ask us now; tell us that and then answer it. 
defaultRachel Wenstonedefault: I think it would have been interesting to pull out a little bit more about the role of apprenticeships and traineeships, the quality and support of apprenticeships, and some of the cultural norms around apprenticeships and the way that this country often reacts to vocational opportunities very differently 
defaultfrom 
defaultthe way that they react to academic opportunities. 
defaultThedefault Chairman:default I think there is a generational issue here. When I was your age apprenticeships were terrific and great and people that I know who started off with apprenticeships ended up as heads of big corporations, but then something went off the boil. We had evidence last week about Barclays creating 400 apprenticeships, but the problem there was—and I heard this during the weekend from another area—that they had to make sure that 
defaultthe people 
defaultcould read and write and were capable of doing maths. This can be overcome too by having a day off in local colleges. Away from 
defaultLondon
default, I know that that is happening. I think you are more afraid and unaware of what apprenticeships can be and I think it is a huge opportunity, but that is only a personal view and I should not be expressing a personal view. What other questions do you think we should have asked you? 
defaultChris Nealdefault: I think from our perspective it is about the role that different aspects of education can provide. We touched quite a lot on formal education but not remembering what is learnt through non-formal education, also informal education. What soft skills do people learn at home? What soft skills do they learn while they are doing the shopping? Also things that come from organisations like the Guides, Scouts, and NUS
default:
default what do they learn when they are part of an organisation? I think focus need
defaults
default to be moved away from formal education to more non-formal education and learning. 
defaultThe Chairman:default It seems sad, does it not, with all the 24-hour TV that people can use
default.
default When I was growing up there was no TV
default. We did not think that we learnt 
defaultanything, 
defaultbut we
default did learn a lot. Maybe it is information overload. 
defaultChris Nealdefault: It could be. 
defaultThe Chairman:default It could be. What else, because this is your last chance? 
defaultHushpreet Dhaliwaldefault: That was my question word for word. 
defaultChris Nealdefault: Sorry. 
defaultThedefault Chairman:default I am not putting you on the spot. If there is anything you think about when you walk away from here, just write. We welcome your input and we would like more of it. I am so glad that you congratulate
defaultd
default us 
defaulton 
defaultinviting young people in
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthat was not my idea. It was a Member who is not here at the moment. Thank you very much. 
defaultChris Nealdefault: A final comment from us. It is great that young people are being talked to and not talked about or talked at, and young people are being engaged in conversations about real issues that affect young people, so we welcome that very strongly. 
defaultThe Chairman:default Good. Perhaps we could start something new. Thank you very much indeed.
