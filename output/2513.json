"Written evidence submitted by the Justice Alliance (LAI 0056)&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Justice Alliance is a coalition of \ncharities, community groups, grass roots and other campaigning groups, trade unions\n, legal organisations\n and individual\ns\n \nunited \nagainst the G\novernment's proposed attack on legal aid\n. We \nbelieve \nthat the residence t\nest should be rejected in its entirety\n \nbecause \nit \nis\n:\n&#xa0;-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nu\nnworkable\n;\n and\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nu\nnjust and d\niscriminatory.\n&#xa0;\nThe proposals are vague as to how the res\nidence test will be satisfied. Our members \nsupport marginalised groups like domestic violence victims and child migrants and have drawn attention to the difficulties that clients will face when they need to provide evidence about residence and legal status. The residence test\n will present a bar to \nthose who will be eligible for legal aid but unable to prove it.\n&#xa0;\nWorse still, the proposals will ine\nvitably result in those in despe\nrate need of legal help be\ning prevented from getting it. \nThis will not only have dire consequences for the people involved but will promote a culture of impunity where abuse and unlawful action against those who cannot afford to pay for legal aid will go unchecked.  This is unacceptable in our view and will weak\nen the \nrule of law by creating a two-t\ni\ne\nr justice system.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;We are an alliance\n&#xa0;\nof charities, community groups, grass roots and other campaigning groups, trade unions\n, legal organisations\n and individuals wh\no are u\nnited in our opposition to the G\novernment's proposed attack on legal aid and the criminal justice\n&#xa0;\nsystem\n.\n These legal aid proposals are part of the larger assault on essential parts of the welfare state.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThis submission provides evidence in relat\nion to the proposed introduction of a residence test for civil legal aid claimants so as to limit legal aid to those with a ‘s\ntrong connection with the UK’. \nThe reason we have focused on the residence test is that this proposal is most likely to affect \nthose who our members support and advocate for and deny \nindiv\niduals access to justice. \nWe are also concerned about the other areas to be considered by the Committee, including the proposals to change payments in judicial reviews which will make it hard for\n individuals to find lawyers and the proposals to remove legal a\nid for most prison law issues. \nHowever, we are aware that others will be addressing the Committee on these important issues\n.\n  \n&#xa0;\nWe are aware that the JCHR’s call for evidence was issued prior \nto the consultation on j\nudicial review published on \n6 September 2013.\n We have deep concerns about \nprop\nosals that would\n restrict campaigning groups from brin\ng\ning judicial review\ns or having costs protection. \nIt is in our view vital that the residence test i\ns seen in the context of these proposed wider restrictions on civil society that will prevent groups from accessing justice on behalf of those who are unable to help themselves.\n&#xa0;We have grave concerns about how this policy will work\n in practice.\n  The p\nr\no\nposals are unclear about what will be required to prove that a person has the appropri\nate amount of lawful residence. \nWe are concerned that efforts to prove this will distract from th\ne important task of getting \nlegal help that is needed and \nwill \ndeter vulnerable people from getting legal assistance.\n&#xa0;\nThe Government’s proposals would require legal aid providers to see and retain \neviden\nce on their files about lawful residence. T\nhis \nwill \nplace a\n substantial bureaucr\natic burden \non \nadvisers and could deter them from undertaking work for migrants as the risk of incorrect assessment would lead to a claim for their work being refused. The assessment is\n \nalso \nlikely to be\n far more complex \nthan \nthe Government suggests, espec\nially for providers who do not specialise in immigration, an area which is now largely out of scope for legal aid\n. \nOne of our members, Just Rights, observes it can take a specialist j\nudge days to determine questions on lawful re\nsidency\n \nand a\n lawyer committ\ned to protecting the rights of children and young people will simply not\n have the resources to do\n this.\n \nThe Association of Prison Lawyers argues it is too \nsimplistic to suggest that the provider will be able to make a straightforward judgement based upon \na passport\n as the Government has previously asserted. Neither does a stamp in a passport give an easy answer. \nFurther, prisoners simply do not have easy access \nto such documents, if they \nhave them\n at all\n.\n T\nhe Home Office \nwill also \nhold passports when an ap\nplication is under consideration\n and communicating with them to get documents back or clarify issues of status\n is very difficult. \n \n&#xa0;\nThe Coram Children’s Legal Centre agrees that the Government has vastly simplified the issue of understanding both what is\n lawful residence and how it can be proven.\n They give the example of European Economic Area (EEA) \nnationals, whose lawful residence\n \ncomes from the exercise of rights under the Treaties that set up the European Union. The rights of EEA nationals exist with\nout the need for documents like a visa. For example, a French national working here is lawfully resident by the fact of their employment. Also, migrants who have made an application to extend their leave or appeal against the refusal of leave have lawful p\nermission to be in the UK under a provision of the law that automatically extends status while an application is pending\n.\n \nIn the experience of our members, such subtleties of immigration law are commonly misunderstood by public bodies such as the Departme\nnt of Work and Pensions and private individuals like employers. The existence of a mechanism for NHS staff to check the immigration status of patients in secondary healthcare with the Home Office recognises both the complexity of this area and that sometim\nes documentary evidence of status will not exist.\n It is unreasonable to expect a legal aid lawyer to make determinations about lawful residence when most have no expertise in immigration law and the same burden is not placed on other public servants.\n&#xa0;\nIn \naddition to proving lawful residence at the point of an application for legal aid, t\nhe\n Government will require migrants to show a 12-month continuous period of residence at any point in the past. This could raise difficulties for an applicant and legal aid\n provider if the period had taken place long ago, as illustrated by the \nCoram Children’s Legal Centre\n:\n&#xa0;\n“\nM is a national of France. When she was at university she lived in the UK for a year on an exchange programme. She is now 27 and has been living in the\n UK for the past six months with her young child and has been working. She and her child are about to be evicted and would qualify for legal aid for her housing matter, but her housing solicitor is unsure whether she meets the residence test. M cannot reme\nmber exactly how long she was in the UK when at university and cannot locate the exact dates to prove it was for 12 months. Additionally, during this time she went back to France during the holidays to see her parents and does not know whether this means s\nhe was not ‘continuously’ in the UK. Her housing solicitor asks her for evidence of her being in the UK lawfully, and does not know what to do when M says she has no visa or document to prove her lawful residence.\n”\n \n&#xa0;&#xa0;It is clear\n that the residence test will result in excluding some of the most vulnerable in our communities from justice.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIt is clear that the residence test is designed to shut out foreign nationals from challenging government complicity in torture, i\nnhumane and degrading treatment. This would include those subjected to extraordinary rendition and detention at \nGuantanamo Bay \nsuch as\n \nBinyam Mohamed and \nBisher Al-\nRawi\n, whose lawyers acted to secure their release while they were still outside the UK\n.\n If \nthe residence test is \nimposed, \nnot one of Reprieve’s clients who have been victims of human rights violations associated with the ‘war on terror’ would be eligible for legal aid\n.\n Repri\ne\nve cite\ns\n how \nYunus\n \nRahmatullah\n, a Pakistani citizen wrongfully arreste\nd by British forces in Iraq in February 2004 and handed over to US forces for rendition to \nBagram\n, may not have been able to bring a judicial review claim in the UK enabling him to be formally identified. As has been widely reported, Mr \nRahmatullah’s\n writ \nof habeas relief was recently u\npheld by the UK Supreme Court, \nreaffirming the importance of the UK’s obligations t\nowards those it takes into its \ncustody\n.\n \nThe Justice Alliance believes that this is tantamount to immunity for unlawful Government action agai\nnst those without independent means.\n Challenging unlawful \nbehaviour is \nin the public interest, to reinforce the values we hold as a society, and for how Britain is seen by the rest of the world. And as stated by\n \nthe Government’s \nTreasury Counsel:\n&#xa0;\n“..\nto pr\nevent people bringing legal proceedings who are subject to the actions of the UK acting abroad, often in ways which are alleged to be contrary to the most fundamental human rights, is in our view impossible to reconcile with the rule of law.\n”\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nThe people and communities most likely to be hit by the residence test are also the most likely to be at risk of unlawful abuse.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe recent case of s\ne\nxual exploitation at Yarl\n’s W\nood \nimmmigration removal\n \nc\nentre\n illustrates how individuals most likely to fall foul of the residence test can be prime candid\nates for institutional abuse. Wi\nt\nh\nout the ava\ni\nlability of legal aid \nto \ndemand a full investigation, we are concerned that such practices will continue with \nimpunity.\n&#xa0;\nThe Justice Alliance also highlights the over representation of people from non British backgrounds in other cases of state abuse. The family of \nJean \nCharles de Menezes, an innocent member of the public shot dead by police,\n would have been preve\nnted from commencing civil pr\noceedings to expose the police’s attempted cover up surrounding Jean Charles’ killing because they would not meet the residence t\nest.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Government has stated that victims of trafficking will now be \nexempt from the residence test for certain cases. However, they will be subject to the test for any case that is not about an application for leave to enter or remain, employment or a claim for damages in connection with their trafficking. \nThe consequence \nof this is that an alleged victim of trafficking may be denied legal assistance at the time it is most needed.\n They will still have to pass the residence test to get help with cases falling under any other area of law like housing or community care. \n&#xa0;\nThe \nresidence test would also prevent an applicant getting legal aid to challenge the Government’s decision that there are no reasonable grounds to conclude they are a potential victim of trafficking. This is what happened in a recent landmark case in the High\n Court,\n where a claimant was removed to Nigeria after the Home Office determined she was not a victim of trafficking. This court found the decision to be unlawful and the Government has been ordered to return her to the UK. This claimant would have failed\n the residence test as she was brought here on a visitor’s visa for six months by her trafficker and was not lawfully resident at the point where she applied for legal aid and did not have 12 months of lawful residence.\n&#xa0;\nThat judgment\n found that the Home O\nffice policy on \"historical victims\" of trafficking is \nitself \nunlawful\n and this will have wide ranging implications for many other people. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nVictims of domestic violence are also likely to suffer because of the re\nsidence test. \n&#xa0;\nThe Government has now introduced an exemption to the residence test for certain victims of domestic violence who need legal advice on an immigration application, but this would not extend protection to everyone who needed help. \n&#xa0;\nThe \nSouth\nall Black Sisters have told us about ‘Raheena’ who\n \narrived in the UK in May 2012. \n&#xa0;\n“Although her husband was a British National, Raheena was granted ‘leave outside the immigration rules’ as she was unable to satisfy the criteria for a spouse visa. Raheena\n was subjected to violence and \nabuse from her husband on a daily basis, and kept a prisoner in her own home. As part of the abuse, her husband often threatened to send her back to Ethiopia and to forcibly remove her daughter from her care. Raheena fled the\n matrimonial home in December 2012. She was refused assistance by Social Services as they claimed that they only owed her daughter a duty of care as she alone was a British National. Raheena approached Southall Black Sisters and we assisted her in submitti\nng an application for the Destitution Domestic Violence Concession (‘DDV Concession’) as she had been treated for all intents and purposes by the immigration authorities as a spousal visa applicant. This was refused. \n&#xa0;\nWith our assistance, Raheena \ninstructed immigration solicitors in March 2013 who challenged the UK\n \nB\norder \nA\ngency\n’s \n(UKBA) \ndecision by way of judicial review. At a hearing at the High Court, the judge agreed with our view and overturned the UKBA’s decision not to accept Raheena’s appli\ncation for the DDV Concession. The High Court also ordered the local authority to assist Raheena and her daughter with accommodation and support under the relevant provisions of Children Act 1989. \n&#xa0;\nRaheena then instructed her immigration solicitor to submi\nt an application for settlement under the Domestic Violence Rule, \nwhich \nshe was granted legal aid for as a result of the successful judicial review.”\n&#xa0;\nUnder the residence test, Raheena would not have been eligible for legal aid to challenge the UKBA’s deci\nsion by way of judicial review\n \nas she had not been resident in the UK for 12 months. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nMany of those with the most pressing housing and community care needs would also suffer under the residence test.  Again, the Southall Black Sisters \nhave told us the story of \nJenna who fled Uganda in 2009 fearing persecution on th\ne grounds of sexual orient\nation:\n&#xa0;\n“Jenna’s partner was killed by a mob following the discovery that they were homosexuals. Jenna entered the UK on a visitor’s visa which she overstayed. Jenna then claimed asylum on two occasions and on both occasions, she was refused. As of Februar\ny 2012, she once again became an overstayer. In August 2012, Jenna was raped in the UK as a result of which, she fell pregnant. When she was \nseven\n months\n’\n pregnant, Jenna approached her local authority for help which was refused. \n&#xa0;\nIn April 2013, Jenna atte\nnded a routine hospital appointment where she disclosed her homelessness and destitution to the midwife who referred her to our services. \n&#xa0;\nSouthall Black Sisters \nassisted Jenna in instructing community care solicitors who intervened on her behalf and \neventually sent a pre-action protocol letter. On receipt of the letter, Jenna was immediately accommodated by her local authority.”\n&#xa0;\nUnder the residence test, \n Jenna would be excluded from legal advice \nfrom\n solicitors who were able to quickly and effective\nly help her obtain accommodation. Had she not obtained this advice, it is likely that she would still be homeless and her child could have been taken into care, depriving the child of its mother and creating an additional and unnecessary burden on public f\ninances. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe\n residence test would also exclude migrants with significant support needs despite a legitimate right to be in the UK. The\n Coram Children’s Legal Centre\n give the example of a child with leave to remain as a refugee dependent who would fail t\nhe residence test because he had not been in the UK for twelve months. This child would lose the chance to get help that could ensure his best interests and welfare are met, through no fault of his own:\n&#xa0;\n“\nL and her son came to the UK three months ago from \nIran through refugee family reunion to join L’s husband. L’s son is eight and has autism and L is struggling to know how to find him suitable support and education. The local authority has not done an assessment and has not complied with its duties to L’s \nson. L was advised to call the Civil Legal Advice telephone gateway and established that she is eligible for legal aid and that her son’s special educational needs fall within the scope of legal aid. However, she and her son have only been in the UK for th\nree months, so he will have to wait another nine months before he passes the residence test and can qualify for legal aid.\n”\n&#xa0;\nWe recommend that:\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe JCHR consider the proposals to restrict legal aid in the wider cont\next of legal aid, including any measure to restrict representative \ngroups from bringing applications for judicial review;\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe JC\nHR seeks evidence from the Minis\ntry of Justice as to how the proposed scheme will work and the impact that the proposed require\nments are like\nly to have on access to justice;\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe JCHR concludes that the residence test must not be brought into force.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe would be happy to provide further evidence or oral evidence if this would assist the committee.\n&#xa0;\n27 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n7\n&#xa0;\n \nwww.savelegalaid.co.uk/justicealli\na\nnce\n \n Ministry of Justice, \nJudicial Review: Proposals for further reform\n, September 2013 \nhttps://consult.justice.gov.uk/digital-communications/judicial-review\nJust Rights, \nresponse to Transforming Legal Aid\n, 4 June 2013, \npara 5.6\n \nwww.justrights.org.uk/?q=resources/publications/transforming-legal-aid-consultation-response-june-2013\n \n \nAssociation of Prison La\nwyers, \nresponse to Transforming Legal Aid\n, 4 June 2013, \npara 95\n \nwww.associationofprisonlawyers.co.uk/wp-content/uploa\nds/2013/06/APL-Legal-Aid-Consultation-Response.Final_.03.6.13.pdf\n \n \nCoram Children’s Legal Centre, response to Transforming Legal Aid\n, 4 June 2013, \npara 36\nwww.childrenslegalcentre.com/userfiles/Transforming_Legal_Aid_Coram_Childrens_Legal_Centre_consultation_response_June_2013.pdf\n \n Immigration Act 1971, s.3C. \nDepartment of Health, Implementing the Ove\nrseas Visitors Hospital Charging Regulations, \n1 October 2012, paras 5.38-5.43 \nwww.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachme\nnt_data/file/213015/GUIDANCE-October-2012-FINAL.pdf\n \n Coram Children’s Legal Centre, response to Transforming Legal Aid\n, 4 June 2013, \npara 36\n \nwww.childrenslegalcentre.com/userfiles/Transforming_Legal_Aid_Coram_Childrens_Legal_Centre_consultation_response_June_2013.pdf\n \nReprieve, \nresponse to Transforming Legal Aid\n, 4 June 2013, \nPara 4.2\n \nwww.reprieve.org.uk/static/downloads/2013_06_04_PUB_Reprieve_Response_to_Consultation_14_2013_Transforming_Legal_Ai\nd.pdf\n \n \nIbid \nPara 4.3 \n \nTreasury Counsel, \nLetter to Attorney General, 4 June 2013 \nhttp://legalaidchanges.wordpress.com/2013/06/06/4\n6\n/\n \nThe Guardian,\n \nDetainees at Yarl's Wood \nimmigration centre 'facing sexual abuse'\n, 14 Septmber 2013,  \nwww.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/sep/14/detainees-yarls-wood-sexual-abuse\n \nR (Atamewan) v SSHD\n \n[2\n013] EWHC 2727 (Admin)\n \n&#xa0;\n Coram Children’s Legal Centre, response to Transforming Legal Aid, 4 June 2013, para 20 \nwww.childrenslegalcentre.com/userfiles/Transforming_Legal_Aid_Coram_Childrens_Legal_Centre_consultation_response_June_2013.pdf\n"
