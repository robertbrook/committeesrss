[normal]enhanced opportunities for the development and export of key European technology including

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The development of an integrated European electricity network w
[normal]ould support
[normal] the UK and other Member States to progress towards a decarbonised economy
[normal] while better utilising existing sources of energy within the EU. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]With increased interconnection, r
[normal]ather than build
[normal]ing
[normal] capacity markets in each Member State, countries will be 
[normal]better 
[normal]able to share capacity and by so doing reduce the cost to the consumer 
[normal]of system balancing.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Roadmap
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In this transition phase to sustainable (zero carbon) electricity supply, fossil fired gas and coal plants will become less used.  With Supergrid this spare plant, which is now becoming semi redundant, c
[normal]ould
[normal] provide back
[normal]-
[normal]up 
[normal]across the EU
[normal] reducing the need for investment in short-term capacity in individual Member States
[normal].  
[normal]The UK for instance could envisage i
[normal]nstead of 
[normal]some of its generation plants including the 
[normal]capacity payment for their availability, 
[normal]to 
[normal]tap into existing spar
[normal]e capacity 
[normal]across a wider market
[normal] and avoid the costs of some of those investments in new generation
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Ergo: 
[normal]less capital expenditure in the UK on new fossil plant.
[normal] 
[normal]Ergo: higher capacity utilisation for existing 
[normal]fossil 
[normal]plant
[normal] across Europe
[normal]. Ergo: 
[normal]cheaper 
[normal]electricity for the entire European customer base.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Supergrid will also deliver
[normal] enhanced security of supply of primary fuel.  It is the means of building 
[normal]new renewable capacity in the Northern seas and across the Mediterranean
[normal]. Ergo:
[normal] 
[normal]a
[normal]ccess to free fuel in
[normal]definitely. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Moreover, with Supergrid there would be a replacement of
[normal] imports with domestic supply. 
[normal]A r
[normal]ecent stud
[normal]y
[normal] by the CEBR in the UK show
[normal]ed
[normal] that the multiplier effect from such replacement is between 2 and 3 depending on the productivity of the econom
[normal]y.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As an addition to the above, a massive export market for European technology would be created.   Currently Siemens, ABB
[normal] 
[normal]and Alstom are the 
[normal]predominant suppliers
[normal] of HVDC technology
[normal] outside of 
[normal]China.
[normal]  
[normal]Two 
[normal]of these companies 
[normal]have their global centres of excellence in the UK. 
[normal]While Prysmian, Nexans and ABB are the main manufac
[normal]turers of transmission cables. 
[normal]They are a
[normal]ll European
[normal] or European based
[normal].  The US, China and some large emerging mar
[normal]kets
[normal] 
[normal]are 
[normal]all 
[normal]considering the development
[normal] of their own 
[normal] Supergrid
[normal]s
[normal].
[normal] Europe can develop it here and export the technology.

[normal]Result
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Currently, 
[normal]European
[normal] electrical utilities are suffering.  Low profitability, following on from low fossil plant utilisation, and long term punitive gas contracts is the current European norm.  There is a strategic space for multinational utilities to take synergies from diffe
[normal]ring peak times and scarcities of fossil plant in some markets, while surpluses exist in others.  None of this can happen without Supergrid.  European trading 
[normal]in electricity is minimal now. 
[normal]With Supergrid trading activity will ensure that, on a pan-Europea
[normal]n scale, the electricity is produced from the lowest cost sources 
[normal]reducing the overall price 
[normal]to the consumer across the EU
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.[bold]              [bold]One example of t[bold]he benefits of trade – UK, France and Spain[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]              
[normal]Opportunity
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The UK has the opportunity to trade electricity with several Member States, not just in the North Seas region. Improved interconnection could deliver electricity from the south of Europe where excess 
[normal]w
[normal]ind
[normal], gas
[normal] and 
[normal]s
[normal]olar capacity can be balanced with UK dom
[normal]estic generation. The UK Government’s design of its future capacity market must include generation from sources outside the UK if the country is to fully benefit. Limiting the market to domestic generation reduces competition, locks in inefficiencies of su
[normal]pply and raises costs for consumers. It also limits the UK’s exploitation of its marine renewable resources, which could be harnessed to supply power across a single market.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]              
[normal]Investment
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The costs of additional HVDC transmission needed to interconnect 
[normal]markets with the UK are significantly less than building new additional generation capacity, and will not run the risk of “locking in” new fossil generation.
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he European Commission 
[normal]has shown
[normal] 
[normal]that 
[normal]from now to 2020 
[normal]€
[normal]500b
[normal]n
[normal] 
[normal]will
[normal] 
[normal]be needed for 
[normal]new power 
[normal]generation, 
[normal]€
[normal]400b
[normal]n
[normal] for distribution and 
[normal]€
[normal]140b
[normal]n
[normal] for transmission
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As an example, the UK, France and Spain have an opportunity to interconnect their markets
[normal] which would enable the trade of UK generation to balance Iberian renewables, and French, Spanish an
[normal]d Portuguese power into the UK at times of peak demand
[normal].
[normal] Such an interconnector would offer a cost competitive option to building new plant in the UK to provide domestic system balancing.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]€2bn estimated 
[normal]cost
[normal] of the interconnector can be contrasted with the estimated €
[normal]19
[normal]bn of Hinkley C. In addition, the link would deliver electricity into the UK for between 
[normal]€
[normal]4
[normal]2
[normal]-
[normal]€
[normal]100 MWh from a mix of existing nuclear and renewables generation in France
[normal] (cost of nuclear in Fran
[normal]ce as defined by 
[normal]ARENH (“accès régulé à l’électricité nucléaire historique”) is 42€/MWh since Jan 1
[normal]st
[normal] 2012)
[normal],
[normal] Spain and Portugal
[normal] (
[normal]€
[normal]50-
[normal]€
[normal]100 MWh corresponding to index prices based on different offers depending on the technology used. M
[normal]I
[normal]BEL prices (power 
[normal]exchange of Spain and Portugal) are lower and for 1
[normal]st
[normal] 
[normal]quarter
[normal] of 2014 
[normal]are
[normal] foreseen at 56.4
[normal]€
[normal]/MWh)
[normal], in contrast to Hinkley which will receive an
[normal] index linked price of 
[normal]€
[normal]109 MWh
[normal] for 35 years
[normal].
[normal] There are therefore clear cost benefits from investment in new HVDC 
[normal]interconnection and this should be factored into the UKs future energy policy, complementing investment in domestic low carbon generation in ensuring a sustainable, affordable and secure electricity supply for future generations.

[normal] The economic impact of offshore wind CEBR 2012:

[normal]See p.7 
[normal]et seq
[normal]: 
[normal]Balance of Trade Benefits[bold]: 
[normal]Under our Accelerated Growth scenario, by 2030, the estimated increase in[bold] net exports is £22.5 billion, sufficient to almost entirely plug the UK’s current balance of trade deficit (recorded at £25.6 billion in 2009, the year corresponding with our forecasts).[bold] These positive trade impacts are driven by our assumptions about red
[normal]uced fossil fuel imports and offshore wind electricity exports as a result of greater offshore wind capacity. They are also driven by our assumptions about the development of the supply chain for offshore wind investments, the increase in UK content of UK 
[normal]offshore wind investments (relative to imports) and the share of continental European offshore wind investment that can be expected to be captured by the UK industry as these supply chain developments occur.
