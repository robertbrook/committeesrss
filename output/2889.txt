[[[Energy Saving Trust – Written evidence]]]The Draft Bill aims to remove section 19 of the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act (CCSEA) which establishes that “It shall be the duty of the Secretary of State to take such steps as he considers appropriate to promote community energy projects”. Removal of this would appear to be at odds with the commitment in the Coalition Agreement to promote community ownership of energy schemes and a considerable number of public statements from the Ministers for Energy and Climate Change. &#xa0;The timing of this is unfortunate as DECC is currently finalising its first “Community Energy Strategy” for publication this autumn/winter. Removing the responsibility for government to promote and report on community energy projects at the same time sends a very confusing mixed message and could even undermine the implementation of the strategy in future.&#xa0;If this section is removed we would want to see it replaced by a stronger responsibility as part of the Community Energy Strategy to be published by DECC in order to provide the statutory imperative for the strategy.&#xa0;Maintaining a strategic context for community energy will be vital to enable government to respond appropriately to the embryonic and fast-growing community energy sector for which successive secretaries of state have expressed enthusiastic support. Community energy has cross-party support for its potential to:&#xa0;&#xa0;Greg Barker, Ed Davey and the Prime Minister have all publically expressed support for community engagement with energy on numerous occasions. The publication of the UK’s first community energy strategy by DECC would appear to indicate that the department feels there is a significant role for government in the promotion and support of community energy projects. Development of the strategy has also included a baseline review of the community energy sector that can form the basis of public reporting on progress. &#xa0;Removing section 19 of the CCSEA risks undermining the trust built up within the sector through the development of the strategy and worse still the implementation of the strategy itself. We would strongly recommend retaining section 19 and only reviewing it once the Community Energy Strategy is published.

[[[Microgeneration]]]It appears that the removal of the requirement on the Secretary of State (under section 4, CCSEA 2006) to publish targets for microgeneration systems is proposed on the basis that it is no longer necessary because microgeneration is now promoted through financial incentive schemes, such as feed-in tariffs (FITs) and the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI). Given that microgeneration is a fast growing industry with a potentially huge contribution to make to:&#xa0;&#xa0;Energy Saving Trust feels that a national target and strategic approach is vital to delivering these benefits and should not be removed at this stage. &#xa0;Whilst Feed in Tariffs (FiTs) have been very successful in reducing the costs and increasing the deployment of solar PV, their impact on other renewable energy technologies has, so far, been less significant. The Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) is also still at an early stage of development and will only be introduced for the domestic sector next year. We feel that a strategic context is vital to maintain a focus on the aims of promoting microgeneration (to reduce carbon emissions, diversify and increase our UK-based energy generation portfolio and make energy more affordable in future) and to monitor whether the FiT and RHI schemes remain fit for the purpose of achieving those aims. It also provides accountability to the public and promotes monitoring and public reporting on the growth of microgeneration which can help to articulate the rationale for government policy in this area.&#xa0;The FiT and RHI mechanisms were designed to help microgeneration technologies reduce their costs more quickly at an early stage in their development. The rapid growth of the market for PV illustrates how quickly conditions can change within embryonic markets. Maintaining a strategic oversight of the development of the market for microgeneration will help government to react early to new barriers to deployment, or indeed rapid advances that reduce the need for government intervention.&#xa0;The newbuild market is hugely significant for the growth of microgeneration in future, however the private sector component of that will not be greatly influenced by FiT and RHI as house builders are unlikely to be system owners so will not be incentivised. Engaging local authorities with the national strategic context for microgeneration has, through policies such as the “Merton Rule”, (requiring 10% on-site renewable energy on new developments) led to greater certainty for investors in microgeneration about the level of demand in future. Eroding the statutory basis for this type of policy could damage confidence in the microgeneration sector.&#xa0;Maintaining the Secretary of State’s responsibility to promote and report on the development of microgeneration is likely to be especially important in the light of the following developments within the energy sector which represent opportunities and constraints that may not be significantly affected by FiT and RHI:&#xa0;

[[[UK electricity infrastructure]]]The strength of the UK electricity infrastructure is already becoming a significant constraint to the deployment of microgeneration in some areas, as the network is already at capacity. This will become a much more significant constraint as the deployment of microgeneration increases due to FiT and RHI support (note that network capacity is a constraint on deployment of heat pumps in areas where the network is weaker, due to their electricity demand). At the same time substantial investment is needed in the UK electricity infrastructure to cope with current and future demand. This is an opportunity to cost-effectively increase the level of microgeneration that could be connected to the network.Removing the strategic context for microgeneration at this point could lead to this opportunity being missed and deployment being significantly constrained by network capacity in the long term.&#xa0;

[[[Advances in energy storage technology]]]Over recent years there have been significant advances that could lead to embedded community and/or domestic scale electricity storage within the next few years. These advances could help to mitigate the intermittency of microgeneration technologies such as Wind and PV, potentially increasing their contribution to the UK generation mix. A strategic overview and context for microgeneration will help government to adapt policy as these technologies advance.&#xa0;

[[[Public interest in energy]]]Public interest in energy is currently very high and DECC has been carrying out an engagement programme around the future of energy in the UK to respond to that. Maintaining microgeneration targets and reporting enables government to respond positively to this interest and helps it to articulate the rationale behind policies such as FiT and to promote the success of FiT in relation to technologies such as PV. Removing the need to report is unlikely to result in significant savings either, as data on installations is collected and logged by Ofgem as part of the FiT/RHI regulation and monitoring process anyway.&#xa0;&#xa0;October 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
