[[[The National Union of Journalists ]]]is the voice for journalism and for journalists across the UK and Ireland working at home and abroad in all sectors of the media as freelances, casuals and staff in newspapers, news agencies, broadcasting, magazines, online, book publishing, in public relations and as photographers. The NUJ was founded in 1907 and has over 30,000 members. We are an affiliate of both the European Federation of Journalists and the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ). &#xa0;The NUJ is very concerned that the government proposes to remove the power of Employment Tribunals to issue wider recommendations to employers who have been found to have unlawfully discriminated. The introduction of this power was widely welcomed by trade unions and other organisations who have taken employment tribunal claims, as it was an important means of ensuring that similar discriminatory actions by the same employer did not happen again.&#xa0;Victims of discrimination who win at tribunal tend to leave their place of work. This happens in around 72 per cent of cases. Without the power to make recommendations there is no mechanism to ensure that the same or similar discrimination will not happen again. In cases of equal pay, there will be no mechanism to ensure that other employees who may be suffering from the same inequalities in pay, have their rights addressed without further tribunal cases. &#xa0;In 2012 we understand there were 19 cases where Tribunals issued wider recommendations – so this is hardly "inappropriate or excessive recommendations" – which is the government's main reason for shelving this provision.&#xa0;Tribunals do not make these recommendations without good cause and are a major tool in promoting good practice. To remove this power would be a retrograde step as it means that an employer who has a history of discriminatory practice would be able to continue to act unfairly towards its employees. Not only is this unfair to the employees but it is wasteful and will result in further tribunal cases which is something that the government wishes to avoid.  The government's own statistics reveal that 46 per cent of employers who have been subject to discrimination claim have done nothing to change their practices.&#xa0;It is notable that the government has criticised the recommendations because they are "non-binding" and therefore "not having a significant impact on employer behaviour". Rather than remove the recommendation, it would be better to give the recommendations teeth.  It is ironic that the government seeks to criticise the "excessive" nature of recommendations yet at the same time denigrate them for not being fully observed.&#xa0;Further, the government surely cannot then go on to claim that the repeal of this power will have "no significant impact on any of the protected characteristics" when 46 per cent of employers make no subsequent changes despite having lost a tribunal or when some employers despite having received recommendations to change practices, ignore the advice.&#xa0;It is far too early in the life of the Equality Act to repeal this provision. The NUJ believes that the government needs to allow this element of the Act to bed in and to fully examine the impact of the recommendations and to scrutinise patterns of behaviour by bad employers who use weaknesses in the tribunal system as a means of continuing their discriminatory behaviour. Such employers believe that the odd tribunal case lost costs them less than pursuing decent and fair employment practices.  &#xa0;The NUJ believes strongly that there are no "red tape" issues with this provision which so far has been used by Employment Tribunals in a careful and reasonable manner. In 15 of the 19 cases where wider recommendations were issued, for example, the recommendations were based on requirements for training in equality and diversity. In seven cases, respondents were advised to address equality issues generally or to review policies.  This is hardly restricting businesses or tying them up in bureaucratic procedures.&#xa0;The NUJ believes that the provision to make recommendations is a reasonable response to organisations which have been found wanting in terms of fair and equal employment practices. To repeal the provision will just give a green light to rogue employers to continue to act in a discriminatory manner.&#xa0;August 2013&#xa0;
