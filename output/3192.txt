[[[Written evidence submitted by E.J. Matthews [FBB0003]]]]&#xa0;Without doubt the BBC carries a higher expectation for delivery of truth and accuracy in its reporting news than any other media outlets. Unlike other broadcasters it also carries an obligation to inform educate and entertain which makes it far more than a purveyor of single subject matter and by description tied to a hard taskmaster.However and from the perspective of a person who grew up through the transitional phase of sole audio visual entity on the whole the BBC has achieved this objective with merit; at least in my opinion until say the past twenty years, during which it has drifted. It has drifted downwards and in a way in which Lord Reith would succumb to apoplexy should he be alive today.The BBC has rested on the laurels won during WW2 and such innovative programmes carried on the less pop-resistant topics of Science, Philosophy innovative Drama and Satiric expose. Programmes such as TW3, Spitting Image, The Ascent of Man, Tomorrows World even live entertainment such as Old Grey Whistle Test or Morecambe and Wise to name but two, laid bench marks which I fear have sadly been over written by the convenience of extensive pre-recording and editing which may well serve to satisfy ‘professional’ standard of approval but serve to disconnect with reality.The News service and perhaps the most important service element of the BBC brief certainly carries the PC Multicultural agenda in to every living-room despite the fact that the nation has never been exposed to any meaningful debate at any stage, whether this is deemed desirable or not by the wider population as a whole. This pro-European agenda coupled with the diminished role of our own Parliament’s autonomy seems more akin to Orwell’s 1984 and the BBC seemingly simply trots out the required supine message without regard to balance of public opinion.The cult of celebrity news-readers is also a cause for concern as it now follows the familiar routine of ritual exchanges of personal pleasantries for simply doing what they are supposed to be doing with detached professionalism. Even the weather reporters are in on the act virtually bypassing the fact that they are addressing the entire nation and not just their pals behind the news desk.This matter however irritating is surpassed by the arrogance of the BBC to remunerate its self-serving participants at rates grossly in excess of the average wage of the licence payers on whom they depend for their existence. The BBC needs to revisit its original and contextual remit from the 1930s as though it was being reborn and only then will it realise how far it has come from its conceptual and ethical roots – but I won’t be holding my breath in expectation.October 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
