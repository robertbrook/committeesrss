defaultQuite simply.
defaultWhy should I have to pay for a BBC which seems to be decadent in so many ways?
default£145 is a lot of money. All they seem to do is Empire build; books magazines 
defaulttravel.
defaultNever mind the other aspects of their bad behaviour the bias etc the leaning toward
defaultone pro-permissive agenda to the exclusion of common taste and decency.

defaultI have watched TV since 1952 I was ten years old. I think I am well placed to
defaultcomment. I ha
defaultve phoned the BBC on many occasions over this last 50 years they
defaultmake it difficult unless one is very determined.
default&#xa0;
defaultA few years ago they have the cheek to install an answer phone system. Before then
defaultone could at least speak to a person. Who sometimes at the
default height of the permissive
defaultera the early 1970,
default 
defaults could be rude and argumentative. Were they having so many
defaultcomplaints that they could not handle the volume? 
defaultI wonder.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is still a large section of Society which abhors the foul language the 'f’
default 
defaultword
defaultetc
default that they continue to broadcast to the detriment o four young people who often
defaultthink that this is the norm. I 
defaultventure to say
default.
default 
defaultIt is not!
default&#xa0;
defaultPublic service broadcasting in my opinion should be a good example to our society.
defaultall aspects of 
defaultit. 
defaultIt should not 
defaultshock in any way.
