[normal]Quite simply.
[normal]Why should I have to pay for a BBC which seems to be decadent in so many ways?
[normal]£145 is a lot of money. All they seem to do is Empire build; books magazines 
[normal]travel.
[normal]Never mind the other aspects of their bad behaviour the bias etc the leaning toward
[normal]one pro-permissive agenda to the exclusion of common taste and decency.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I have watched TV since 1952 I was ten years old. I think I am well placed to
[normal]comment. I ha
[normal]ve phoned the BBC on many occasions over this last 50 years they
[normal]make it difficult unless one is very determined.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A few years ago they have the cheek to install an answer phone system. Before then
[normal]one could at least speak to a person. Who sometimes at the
[normal] height of the permissive
[normal]era the early 1970,
[normal] 
[normal]s could be rude and argumentative. Were they having so many
[normal]complaints that they could not handle the volume? 
[normal]I wonder.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is still a large section of Society which abhors the foul language the 'f’
[normal] 
[normal]word
[normal]etc
[normal] that they continue to broadcast to the detriment o four young people who often
[normal]think that this is the norm. I 
[normal]venture to say
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]It is not!
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Public service broadcasting in my opinion should be a good example to our society.
[normal]all aspects of 
[normal]it. 
[normal]It should not 
[normal]shock in any way.
