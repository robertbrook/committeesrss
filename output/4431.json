"&#xa0;&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nSouth Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive\n (LTD0022)\n&#xa0;\nThis consultation response has been prepared on behalf of Sheffield City Region (SCR) Executive and South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive (SYPTE). The response reflects the evolving governance in SCR towards a Combined Authority and the wider conte\nxt of the Strategic Economic Plan (SEP), which Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) areas are currently preparing for Government.\n* What is the rationale for the Government’s proposals to devolve to a local level decision-making on transport expenditure? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Government’s approach? Are there better models?The rationale for devolution is about \nputting decision making closer to the people affected\n.  \nEngland has become one of the most centralised countries in Europ\ne, therefore increasing the disconnect between Whitehall and ‘the people’\n.  \nWhitehall faces the significant challenge of understanding why investment in transport, or any other type of infrastructure, is needed. \nThis \nneed is best understood by those who a\nre directly accountable to the people where the investment is needed.\nThis new approach allows City Regions to make long term, strategic plans \non major infrastructure and avoid the stop-go delivery of national projects.  \nIn SCR, the BRT North scheme incurr\ned an 8 month delay and resulted in additional funding being sought as a consequence of additional processes introduced by Government. The addition of the development pool and the Best and Final Bidding Process increased the level of uncertainty for the Pr\noject, which could have been avoided through greater local controls. \n, \n \nDevolvement of decisions on transport expenditure is only the start of the journey. Areas like the Sheffield City Region (SCR) are \nstrengthening\n governance arrangements and \nestablishing \nan accountable body to deal with strategic transport and economic rege\nneration decision making. In the SCR this is in the form of a Combined Authority. The wider remit of these bodies\n and the role of the private sector\n, \nare \ncritical to ensuring that investment \ndecisions \nsolve the economic problem, not just transport problem.\n \nAt present \nthe Combined Authority\n \nis \nlacking two important features, which \nif available, \nwould \nfurther enhance \nthe delivery of \nthis wider remit of strategic economic regeneration. \nCurrently, \nthe Combined Authority\n \nis \nunable to claim VAT and can only lev\ny for transport funding.  \nIt is vital that Combined Authorities can raise funds to spend on investment across a range of activities including transport, and that the statute that underpins the Combined Authority\n,\n enables this function.\n* Do local bodies (including Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Partnerships, Passenger Transport Executives, Integrated Transport Authorities and Local Transport Boards) have the capacity to assess, prioritise and deliver local transport schemes? What would the optimum delivery body look like?The move from central decision making to local decision making brings with it cost \nand \nresource \nimplications\n. \nLocal bodies have the capacity to assess, prioritise and deliver local transport schemes, \nthe challenge is resourcing this\n.  \nThe \ncost will be borne by local partners and \nit \nis expected \nto be funded\n collectively, through funding available at the SCR Region level (rather than local contributions).\n L\nike most City Regions, SCR will choose to ‘top\n-\nslice’ their fund\n but\n we want to kee\np this to a minimum\n,\n in order to retain focus upon scheme delivery.  \nAs with any shift of this type, Local Authority partners will need to work through what is best for their area. Alongside the need to allocate resource is the need to reduce costs, so it\n will be important for LTB’s/LEP’s to work with other areas to find ways of sharing resources and \nworking more closely together.\n  SCR are working across the City Region to appraise schemes a\ngainst a set of shared criteria\n \nand\n work\ning\n with other LEP areas t\no share technical processes\n.  This open approach to working practices\n maintain\ns\n efficiency\n through the pooling of resources\n.\nTo support this new approach, the SCR LTB has agreed an Assurance Framework.  This was created to support our decision making and outlines the tools which will be used within this framework. \nThis framework can be applied to all types of infrastructure \nproj\nects, which is\n in keeping with the aspirations of the Local Growth Fund and facilitates cross-silo\n \nworking.  \nIt is expected that the delivery body for decision making will be a combination of a central officer team, supported by a panel of consultancy expe\nrts. \nDelivery of the investment will not change in SCR as scheme promoters\n,\n (typically Local Authorities)\n,\n will remain the delivery body. Promoters will need to demonstrate to local decision makers in their business case, that they have the capacity to de\nliver, to justify the investment. By separating the investment decisions from the delivery, \nmaintains a \nclear \ndistinction \nbetween decision makers and promoters.\n* What is the best way of dealing with major transport schemes that cross Local Authority boundaries or have wider regional impact?For investment that has \na \nregional impact\n,\n it will be critical that the promoter works with the Local Authorities and Combined Authority(ies), to demonstrate how the investment supports the priorities of the places where investment is planned. \nIt is felt that the LEPs are able to deal with major t\nransport schemes \nthat \ncross boundaries and more mature \nworking relationships \nwill be able to overcome differences\n,\n to ens\nure high Value for Money scheme\n \ndelivery\n.  \nAs LEP’s and Combined Authorities become more established in their role to shape regional i\nnvestment, it is expected that LEP’s will work more collaboratively on regional projects.  \nA good example of this in practice is the Rail North Strategy which emerged from cross boundary working between Sheffield, Manchester and Leeds City Regions.  T\nhe pa\nrtnership \nwas \nformed to influence rail devolution in the north\n and demonstrates joint working in practice, between LEPs\n. \nSimilarly, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire have worked collaboratively on the introduction of Smartcard schemes and joint healthcare\n services\n,\n therefore collaborative working is not the issue for us.   \nC\nross boundary scheme negotiation has two elements\n;\n \nf\nirstly, the appropriate governance in place to make decisions across the geography where the investment is proposed.  \nSecondly, it i\ns important to have evidence to support decision making.\n \nT\nhe SCR Combined Authority provide\ns\n the Accountable Body to make these decisions\n \nand the \nSCR land use and transport model (FLUTE model), enables schemes to be assessed on a consistent basis, regardle\nss of whether they cross Local Authority boundaries.\n  As SCR have the tools in place and the working relationships with partners to facilitate cross boundary scheme delivery, greater financial autonomy would enable the delivery of more schemes at a local l\nevel.  \n  \n* How effectively do local bodies work with each other and with Government departments and national transport agencies?For this question there good and bad examples of how various organisations work together.  As described above, the Rail North \npartnership is a good example of how local bodies have come together with national transport agencies and Government, to establish a proposition to shape future franchising of regional rail services in the north.\nT\nhere is more work to do to \nfurther \nalign t\nhe priorities of local bodies with external agencies\n,\n that have the potential to make significant differences to local areas. \nCurrently the approach to consultation \nis\n a one way process.  \n Local Authorities are currently providing input to National Infrast\nructure Strategies but at the moment, it is unclear how our comments have \nbeen reflected.   Our preferred model of consultation would be where local priorities are clearly set out within national plans, with a mix of \nlocal and agency delivery.\nIt is essent\nial that Government departments continue to work with LEP’s.  This collaboration is enabling local partner\ns\n to focus decision making on local priorities that meet national objectives. In some areas the relationships are well established, for example with t\nhe Homes and Communities Agency, Department for Transport and Department for Communities and Local Government. SCR see the\nse\n relationships as a positive outcome of the move towards localism and will seek to strength\nen\n the working relationships through the \nStrategic Economic Plan.\n* Do the current funding streams for major local transport schemes meet the needs of Local Authorities? How do current funding streams compare with previous arrangements? The current funding streams \nare insufficient and \ndo not mee\nt the needs of \nL\nocal \nA\nuthorities\n.\n SCR are seeking to correct this by securing major infrastructure funding that allows the area to invest in the transformational infrastructure that can grow the economy.  Transport and connectivity are a vital part of the mix of infrastructure investment \nrequired and we continue to encourage Government to devolve more funding on this basis.\nPteg has prepared a separate response in which they identify the significant gap between investment in PTE areas and London. We support the points made in their respons\ne which outline the impact of the gap in infrastructure funding, outside of London. SCR see the SEP as the mechanism to rebalance the investment in major schemes.\n* What impact will the devolution in 2015 of funding to Local Transport Bodies and the introduction of the Single Local Growth Fund have?For SCR, devolution has been a positive process, enabling Local Authorities to \nbetter prioritise \nwork  across the geography. \nDevolution \nhas enabled the \nestablishment of \na Combined Authority to progress at pace, \nalongside the creation of an \nambitious \ninfrastructure investment programme\n.\nSCR took \nthe \ndecision \nat the start of our journey\n \nto think about a wider programme of investment\n,\n beyond transport\n.\n \nT\nhe \ndevolution of funding \nfrom Government\n \nwill \nenable faster and\n better prioritisation of schemes and allow local accountability\n,\n using local knowledge to select how and where schemes should be delivered for maximum impact.  \nWe expect to see this type of approach adopted more widely in other areas, for example our neig\nhbours (West Yorkshire and D2N2) are looking at how to move their transport fund to a wider investment fund, as we have already done.\nThe role of the LTB will change in the context of the Strategic Economic Plan and the wider investment decisions that Comb\nined Authorities will make. SCR partners have always seen the LTB as part of a wider function of the CA and we are not surprised that the governance we are seeking to establish, matches Government\n’\ns ambitions to provide funding for a range of activities th\nrough a single source. As a result of the CA and Local Growth Fund, the LTB will be subsumed within a wider decision making body\n,\n so that decisions on strategic investment are taken by a single body.\n* How can Local Authorities attract greater investment from the private sector for the delivery and maintenance of local transport infrastructure? What scope is there for the use of alternative funding streams?To attract greater investment it is critical to have a clear and well evidenced proposition that prov\nides a return\n, which \nthe private sector is interested in. The work SCR have undertaken to create the SCR Investment Fund (SCRIF) is focussed on having a clear proposition from which negotiations can begin. \nUnderpinning the proposition is the need for \nlonger-term certainty over available funds as a baseline for wider ambitions. SCR have been successful in securing a 10 year allocation through the City Deal process for devolved Major Scheme Transport Funding to provide that baseline, but this is only the\n beginning.\nThe ambition for SCRIF is to provide a ‘fund of funds’ to deliver long-term programmes of investment.  The funding will work on two levels. Firstly at the programme level by combining a range of funds allocated to the City Region, the Combined \nAuthority will have the ability to deliver transformational schemes on a scale that individual authorities may find more challenging. Secondly, at a scheme level by demonstrating local commitment to a scheme, promoters will be in a stronger position to sec\nure contributions or to accelerate delivery, as the level of certainty over the longer term is increased. This negotiation will help to reduce the call on the programme level funding, enabling more schemes to be delivered.\nIn the case of public transport i\nnvestment, it is unlikely that these types of intervention give a return on investment, so will therefore be unattractive to the private sector.  The capital investment made is likely to continue to be supported by the public sector but the on\n-\ngoing use of\n these assets will need to have commercial buy in from the private sector.  To make the best use of investment and to support the private sector, SCR are exploring other flexibilities (e.g. TIF), to capture \nthe \nlocal value added and offset \nthis \nagainst sch\neme costs. \nFor transport\n,\n the need to express the proposition is especially important in the context of ensuring that external agencies, including the Government, deliver investment that complements local priorities.  SCR will be expressing through the St\nrategic Economic Plan, the work that has been undertaken to demonstrate the investment needed to provide the right transport offer to businesses, for example for connectivity to HS2 stations.\n* How clear are the lines of accountability for local decision making on transport expenditure?The lines of accountability within the Sheffield City Region are very clear.  The Combined Authority has been established as the accountable body, which has a clear structure \nin place\n.\n  The Combined Authority\n has membership from elected members and operates under the guidance of an Assurance Framework, which has been agreed by all \nmember Authorities.\n \n \n  \n   \nThe\n Assurance Framework sets out how decisions are taken and who is responsible at each stage.  \nLocal Authority partners form part of the decision making structure and as they are also the scheme promoters, this creates a lean decision making structure. \nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n Tony Travers; The Guardian, \nJuly 2013\n [\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/local-government-ne\ntwork/2013/jul/10/tony-travers-devolution-local-government\n]\n"
