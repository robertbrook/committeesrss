[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]24. [bold]It is difficult to answer this question with certainty because of the 
[normal]potentially 
[normal]very long duration of sub-clinical infection in individuals affected with prion diseases.  On the positive side it can be noted that there has been no evidence of transmission of vCJD by blood trans
[normal]fusion
[normal] since the introduction of universal leucodepletion in 1999.  On the other hand the prevalence of sub-clinical infection is estimated to be 1 in 2000 in the general population, the level of infectivity in the peripheral blood is unknown and the level of susceptibility of infected individuals to develop clinical disease in the longer term is unclear.  Therefore it would be premature to consider that there is no threat of ongoing transmission through blood components, tissues, cells and organs.  Plasma for manufacture of pharmaceutical agents is sourced outwith the 
[normal]United Kingdom
[normal] and therefore poses minimal risk.  UK Blood Services and SaBTO continue to review proposed new vCJD risk mitigation measures.  There are none of clear superior utility available at present.
