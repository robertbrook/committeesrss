[normal]Written evidence submitted by [bold]Linkage Community Trust[bold]Summary[bold]Although Linkage Community Trust are not aware of any of our own service users being particularly affected by housing costs in the reformed welfare system, we are conscious that the impacts on vulnerable people with learning disabilities and th
[normal]eir families who live in social housing are being felt far and wide across the country.
[normal]We have become aware of several initiatives which are being used to support vulnerable people to afford to stay in their homes. These initiatives are outlined in more d
[normal]etail in our full response. 
[normal]They clearly highlight the resistance from front-line workers and Local Authorities to the incoming welfare changes, which are seemingly proving more costly to implement and enforce than the previous system. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Response[bold]1. [bold]Local[bold] authority funding mechanisms[bold]1.1.
[normal] 
[normal]We have been made aware that s
[normal]ome social workers with real initiative have found a way round some of the 
[normal]social sector size criteria
[normal] issues. 
[normal]Under the charging system for social care 
[normal]people
[normal] are assessed as to whether they
[normal] need to
[normal] make a co
[normal]ntribution towards the service under the Fair Access to Care
[normal] 
[normal]Services criteria (
[normal]FACS
[normal])
[normal].   
[normal]Any service user who receives housing benefit and has
[normal] a
[normal] bedroom supplement to pay
[normal],
[normal] i.e. the housing benefit
[normal] is less 
[normal]than the rent
[normal] so the tenant has to pay the 
[normal]difference, can have the top-
[normal]up amount set 
[normal]against
[normal] the L
[normal]ocal 
[normal]A
[normal]uthority
[normal] financial assessment. This reduces the contribution they have to make because it should reduce their fairer charge by the same amount as the t
[normal]op-up. 
[normal]T
[normal]hey
[normal] 
[normal]are able
[normal] to calculate the top-up and then ask the finance 
[normal]department
[normal] at the L
[normal]ocal 
[normal]A
[normal]uthority
[normal] for this to be taken into account.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. [bold]Social sector size criteria[bold]2.1. 
[normal]We are aware that s
[normal]ome 
[normal]Local A
[normal]uthorities are taking another approach. 
[normal]For 
[normal]example, i
[normal]f
[normal] two
[normal] people are living in 
[normal]three
[normal] bedroom soci
[normal]al
[normal] housing accommodation,
[normal] 
[normal]the Local Authority
[normal] 
[normal]has
[normal] re
[normal]-
[normal]designated one room as a study. 
[normal]T
[normal]his is because the Local Authority
[normal] ha
[normal]s
[normal] decided that the cost of rehousing would be greater than finding a way roun
[normal]d the 
[normal]social sector size criteria or ‘
[normal]bedroom tax
[normal]’
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. Our own experiences[bold]3.1 
[normal]Linkage Community Trust had one service user who moved into a 2-bedroom property in February 2013 as he required sleep-in staff due to his needs. The recent changes to 
[normal]housing benefits may have affected him but, due to staff incurring extra utility costs, Linkage only charged this service user the 1-bedro
[normal]om rent fee to compensate this.
[normal]Although most of our service users live in 1-bedroom properties, we are anticipating t
[normal]hat those service users in 2-bed accommodation may be affected by the changes to housing-related benefits in the near future as they are re-assessed for housing benefits. This is because their current housing benefi
[normal]ts applications are historical.
