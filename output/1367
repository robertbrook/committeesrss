defaultWritten evidence submitted by defaultLinkage Community TrustdefaultSummarydefaultAlthough Linkage Community Trust are not aware of any of our own service users being particularly affected by housing costs in the reformed welfare system, we are conscious that the impacts on vulnerable people with learning disabilities and th
defaulteir families who live in social housing are being felt far and wide across the country.
defaultWe have become aware of several initiatives which are being used to support vulnerable people to afford to stay in their homes. These initiatives are outlined in more d
defaultetail in our full response. 
defaultThey clearly highlight the resistance from front-line workers and Local Authorities to the incoming welfare changes, which are seemingly proving more costly to implement and enforce than the previous system.

defaultWe have been made aware that s

default3. Our own experiencesdefault3.1 
defaultLinkage Community Trust had one service user who moved into a 2-bedroom property in February 2013 as he required sleep-in staff due to his needs. The recent changes to 
defaulthousing benefits may have affected him but, due to staff incurring extra utility costs, Linkage only charged this service user the 1-bedro
defaultom rent fee to compensate this.
defaultAlthough most of our service users live in 1-bedroom properties, we are anticipating t
defaulthat those service users in 2-bed accommodation may be affected by the changes to housing-related benefits in the near future as they are re-assessed for housing benefits. This is because their current housing benefi
defaultts applications are historical.
