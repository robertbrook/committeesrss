"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Amy Boyd (WSC083)Declaration of interests\nI am a postdoctoral researcher so it is in my interest to see some of the changes outlined below realised. Otherwise no competing interests.\n The views expressed are my own and are not a reflection of the views or policies of my employer.\n1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA clich√© but I believe mainly this is due to the \ntime and energy \ndemand\ns of \nchildcare (even if children are at nursery etc)\n and other domestic \nresponsibilities\n.\n1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAcademic contracts are generally short term which does not provide \nfinancial\n security.\n1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nResearch positions are not particularly well paid so if a family has 3 children\n \nthis will mean that practically all one parents salary may go towards childcare\n.\n1.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTaking time out to have children can negatively impact upon publication rate which is a major consideration in academia. I believe some funding bodies now take this into \nconsideration when assessing applications.\n&#xa0;\n2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAllow flexible working. Perhaps make it compulsory \nto have a trial period before a final decision is made to ensure that flexible working is a realistic solution in any given instance.\n2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMake it easier for funding arrangements to be altered to part time work or job sharing if acceptable to employer.\n2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnsure t\nhat flexible working is also an option for men in STEM careers and that their funding arrangements can also be altered easily. This allows men to support their partners careers. Partners of many scientists I know are married to other STEM professionals.\n2.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMa\nke some kind of allowance for days taken off sick with children. At the moment there is parental leave but this needs to be booked in \nadvance in \nblocks of a week, requiring you to know when you child will fall \nill!\n2.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe University of Oxford Zoology department \ngenerally supports \nflexible working. This generates goodwill between employee and employer, as the employee is incentivised to show that they can be as productive while using their time in the most efficient way \npossible. On a personal note, my supervisor supports flexible working. This allows me to (for example) start work early when I am most productive and leave early to do household tasks, freeing up the evening for me to work more if required. I have worked f\nor people who insist on attendance to a strict timetable and this does not make me feel like going the extra mile. In those situations I would work my hours but not a second more.\n&#xa0;\n3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLegislate to support points 2.1. to 2.4.\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
