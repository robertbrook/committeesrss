[normal]International
[normal].  
[normal]Sexual child abuse images on UK based 
[normal]URLs are typically removed from 
[normal]the internet within 60 minutes of the IWF learning of their existence.
[normal]  However, about 99% of such images are hosted in other countries, so a huge amount of work is required by foreign and international agencies to make a strong impact on the problem.  This is an international issue, not one specific to the UK.  In our view,
[normal] therefore, the government needs to show strong leadership in working effectively with international regulators and other governments to ensure there is cross-border coordination and action.
[normal]  This requires policies in favour of internet standards and enfor
[normal]cement.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Enforcement.  
[normal]It seems 
[normal]that 
[normal]the flow of work from identifying illegal content to prosecution needs to work smoother.  The proactive approach now being taken by the IWF will deliver more intelligence to CEOP on victims and criminals.  The 
[normal]investigative and prosecution authorities will require a level of resource to manage this increased workload.  We need a higher number and rate of prosecutions to increase the efficiency
[normal], actual impact
[normal] and va
[normal]lue that is being delivered 
[normal]to act as a
[normal] further 
[normal]and stronger
[normal] deterrent.  On both enforcement and prosecution a greater level of international cooperation and action is required.  Inter-governmental summits need to put this on their agenda for 
[normal]pragmatic 
[normal]action.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Online/Offline harmonization.  
[normal]While Telef
[normal]ó
[normal]nica and other operators operate a robust system of age verification to ensure the safeguarding of under-18s from adult internet content, many offline vendors are not as effective and vigilant in this regard.  Perhaps it i
[normal]s time to insist that 
[normal]all 
[normal]publish
[normal]ers 
[normal]in the UK 
[normal]- online or offline - should have the same 
[normal]UK 
[normal]legal obligations to protect children from being exposed to 
[normal]inappropriate 
[normal]images 
[normal]and content.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Education and skills.  
[normal]We are committed to supporting and encouraging digital skills and entrepreneur
[normal]ship in young people through such initiatives 
[normal]as 
[normal]Campus Party and th
[normal]e Think Big School
[normal] (
[normal]which 
[normal]will work with over 3,000 14-18 year olds this year
[normal])
[normal].  We are looking at how we can incorporate online safety messages into the Think Big School schedule, but the
[normal] government’s new computing and D&amp;T curricula offer a good opportunity for online safety messages and content to reach many more young people.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Devices.
[normal]  Telef
[normal]ó
[normal]nica cannot fully control the human factors (HMI) or ease of use on devices.  Many devices 
[normal]and Apps 
[normal]are purchased through independent channels
[normal] or Apps stores
[normal].  It is important that devices approved for connection to the internet 
[normal]meet essential requirements
[normal] and that Apps are deemed legal.  
[normal]One avenue that could be considered is whether 
[normal]we have 
[normal]th
[normal]e right
[normal] Type Approval procedures to assure internet safety, pragmatic HMI controls and trusted Apps.
