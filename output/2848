default.  
defaultSexual child abuse images on UK based 
defaultURLs are typically removed from 
defaultthe internet within 60 minutes of the IWF learning of their existence.
default  However, about 99% of such images are hosted in other countries, so a huge amount of work is required by foreign and international agencies to make a strong impact on the problem.  This is an international issue, not one specific to the UK.  In our view,
default therefore, the government needs to show strong leadership in working effectively with international regulators and other governments to ensure there is cross-border coordination and action.
default  This requires policies in favour of internet standards and enfor
defaultcement.

defaultEnforcement.  
defaultIt seems 
defaultthat 
defaultthe flow of work from identifying illegal content to prosecution needs to work smoother.  The proactive approach now being taken by the IWF will deliver more intelligence to CEOP on victims and criminals.  The 
defaultinvestigative and prosecution authorities will require a level of resource to manage this increased workload.  We need a higher number and rate of prosecutions to increase the efficiency
default, actual impact
default and va
defaultlue that is being delivered 
defaultto act as a
default further 
defaultand stronger
default deterrent.  On both enforcement and prosecution a greater level of international cooperation and action is required.  Inter-governmental summits need to put this on their agenda for 
defaultpragmatic 
defaultaction.

defaultOnline/Offline harmonization.  
defaultWhile Telef
defaultó
defaultnica and other operators operate a robust system of age verification to ensure the safeguarding of under-18s from adult internet content, many offline vendors are not as effective and vigilant in this regard.  Perhaps it i
defaults time to insist that 
defaultall 
defaultpublish
defaulters 
defaultin the UK 
default- online or offline - should have the same 
defaultUK 
defaultlegal obligations to protect children from being exposed to 
defaultinappropriate 
defaultimages 
defaultand content.

defaultEducation and skills.  
defaultWe are committed to supporting and encouraging digital skills and entrepreneur
defaultship in young people through such initiatives 
defaultas 
defaultCampus Party and th
defaulte Think Big School
default (
defaultwhich 
defaultwill work with over 3,000 14-18 year olds this year
default)
default.  We are looking at how we can incorporate online safety messages into the Think Big School schedule, but the
default government’s new computing and D&amp;T curricula offer a good opportunity for online safety messages and content to reach many more young people.

defaultDevices.
default  Telef
defaultó
defaultnica cannot fully control the human factors (HMI) or ease of use on devices.  Many devices 
defaultand Apps 
defaultare purchased through independent channels
default or Apps stores
default.  It is important that devices approved for connection to the internet 
defaultmeet essential requirements
default and that Apps are deemed legal.  
defaultOne avenue that could be considered is whether 
defaultwe have 
defaultth
defaulte right
default Type Approval procedures to assure internet safety, pragmatic HMI controls and trusted Apps.
