&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence from Robert Goodwill MP, Department for Transport (WRT 040)&#xa0;When I gave evidence to the Transport Committee on 28 October in relation to the above Inquiry I promised to write with further information on what actions have been taken following the report published in December 2011 titled, 'Winter Resilience in Transport: an assessment of the case for additional investment'.&#xa0;As the Committee will know, the then Secretary of State for Transport, Philip Hammond, commissioned a joint review by  chief economists and scientists at the Department for Transport, Department of Energy and Climate Change and the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs to establish if there was a case for greater investment in measures to improve winter resilience.&#xa0;The report published in December 2011 was the culmination of that review. The key findings from the report suggested that the balance of investment in winter from a transport perspective was broadly adequate, however it identified  a number of areas where  further work should be considered and maybe beneficial.&#xa0;In light of the report, the Department worked closely with the wider sector to take action on the report's recommendations. For instance, one of the key areas in which the report identified would be beneficial was in respect to introducing third rail heating to help reduce disruption on the rail network to the south of London.&#xa0;In December 2011 the Department announced that it was providing Network Rail with £16 million for this purpose. I can confirm to the Committee that following this Network Rail has invested a further £13 million and this funding has led to the installation of over 62 miles of conductor rail heating strips at critical locations on the third rail network south of the Thames.&#xa0;The report also highlighted areas which could benefit from further investigation in order to ensure that we keep the road network open and safe during any periods of severe winter weather the country may encounter. This included asking the UK Roads Board to explore a range of ideas to make better use of salt, equipment and infrastructure - including recalibrating gritters, training gritter operators and the sharing of covered storage facilities for salt.&#xa0;The Department has been working closely with the UK Roads Liaison Group and its sub-Group, UK Roads Board and the National Winter Service Research Group (NWSRG) to consider some of the measures the report highlighted. That is why the Department has funded further work to update guidance on winter service as part of Well Maintained Highways Code of Practice. This builds on the work that was undertaken in 2011 following the David Quarmby Independent Review into winter which reported in October2010. This updated guidance will help highway authorities deliver a much more effective and efficient winter service strategy.&#xa0;The most significant shift with the publication of the new Winter Guidance has been the change from two spread rate tables -which had been the advice in 'Well-Maintained Highways' before the new edition - to 12 tables. The 12 table format provides more detailed guidance allowing an authority to follow different tables on different parts of their network depending on equipment, salt and storage. The guidance also provides comprehensive decision making matrices and flowcharts to help authorities. Another area where action has been taken is in respect of the NWSRG offering a peer review service to authorities in respect of winter service to ensure they offer an efficient and effective winter service. In addition the NWSRG and the wider sector have implemented a winter decision making course on behalf of the UK Roads Board.&#xa0;I hope my oral evidence and this follow up letter has demonstrated that theGovernment takes the issue of being prepared for winter very seriously. As I am sure you are aware significant efforts have been made across the transport sectors, including road, rail and aviation, in order to boost resilience and preparedness for any severe winter weather we may encounter. This work builds on the actions the Department for Transport has taken in response to a number of winter resilience reports including the Transport Committee's previous report into this important issue.&#xa0;The Department for Transport has throughout this winter season continued to work closely with all key transport operators, the local government sector,salt suppliers and other key partners to ensure that disruption to the transport network is kept to a minimum in the event of any severe winter weather that the country may encounter.&#xa0;Of course, whilst we can and have taken action to mitigate disruption, it must be recognised that Transport services will always be at risk during periods of sustained extreme weather. The transport sector will endeavour to do everything possible to keep disruption to a minimum and ensure that the transport system recovers as quickly as possible.&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;
