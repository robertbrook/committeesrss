defaultWe understand that the Committee is examining
default the rationale for excluding particular types of 
defaultretailer from the proposed levy for single use carrier bags.  We consider that airport retailers in 
defaultEngland
default should be exempt from the levy.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn summarydefault, these are the reasons for such an exemption:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultTo show clearly that items which could potentially pose a security risk (particularly liquids, aerosols and gels) have been purchased airside, the mandatory requirement to provide Security Tamper Evident Bags (“STEBs”) means that airside retailers must be allowed to continue to provide bags to customers and that the bags should be exempt from any charge. 
defaultFurthermore, it is essential that all airside purchases are carried on board the aircraft in bags to ensure that they can be securely held in the overhead bins or under aircraft seats and do not pose a danger by becoming loose and falling on passengers below or by obstructing gangways.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultTo ensure consistency across the 
defaultUK
default and avoid customer confusion, the legislation in 
defaultEngland
default should mirror that already enacted in 
defaultWales
default and 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default, and the Scottish Government’s draft legislation, which all provide for exemption from their respective levies for bags provided by businesses operating airside at airports.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultWhile security and regulatory requirements are paramount reasons for an exemption 
defaultfrom the levy 
defaultfor airside retailers
default, i
defaultt is also important to take into account the significant difference between high street retail and 
defaultairport 
defaultshopping
default.  Firstly, passengers come to airports to fly, not to shop and therefore do not come armed with shopping bags as they would to make their weekly supermarket shop.  Secondly, many airport purchases are made on impulse, thus again passengers do not have shopping bags with them.  P
defaultroducts purchased are often heavy
default, meaning that
default sturdy bags are required
default.
