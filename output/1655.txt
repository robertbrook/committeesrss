[[[Written evidence submitted by Carbon Capture and Storage Association (CCS27)]]]Executive SummaryThe CCSA welcomes this inquiry. The development of a vibrant CCS industry is critically important for UK climate, energy and industrial policy. However, the deployment of CCS in the UK is facing a number of challenges. This submission sets out the CCSA’s views on the current status of the technology, the challenges impacting on deployment and makes a number of recommendations on how CCS can be progressed. The CCSA would like to emphasise the following points;  Introduction &#xa0;CCS Technology&#xa0;The CCS Cost Reduction Task Force “UK gas and coal power stations equipped with carbon capture, transport and storage have clear potential to be cost competitive with other forms of low-carbon power generation, delivering electricity at a levelised cost approaching £100/MWh by the early 2020s, and at a cost significantly below £100/MWh soon thereafter.”The Task Force found that there are multiple opportunities to reduce the costs of UK CCS projects based on current technologies. These cost reductions largely occur as a result of local effects, e.g. shared infrastructure, and are not solely dependent on global market developments. CCS cost reduction opportunities can be grouped into four key areas (Figure 1);&#xa0;Figure 1, Cost Reduction Task Force CCS cost reduction trajectory&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The Task Force identified a number of actions that are needed in order to deliver these cost reductions. The electricity market alone cannot deliver these cost reductions and a number of interventions are required by Government if a cost competitive CCS industry is to be delivered in the UK.   &#xa0;Status of CCS worldwide &#xa0;CCS in the UK &#xa0;&#xa0;Progressing CCS in the UK &#xa0;&#xa0;International CCS&#xa0;The view expressed in this paper cannot be taken to represent the views of all members of the CCSA. However, they do reflect a general consensus within the Association.September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/201021/CCS_Cost_Reduction_Taskforce_-_Final_Report_-_May_2013.pdf http://cdn.globalccsinstitute.com/sites/default/files/publications/85741/global-status-ccs-january-2013-update.pdf http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/location/ccs-china&#xa0;
