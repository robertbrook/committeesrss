[[[, Aberdeenshire]]]&#xa0;The family of Begg moved into Badenyon, Glenbuchat in 1775 and were in continuous occupation of the property until 1956 when the last occupier of the property, John Begg, died. In his will among other things, he left to George Begg, farmer Milton Bank, Aberdeenshire “All my interest as land holder at Badenyon” It is not known what this means. &#xa0;I am Ian McKerron Begg a descendant of the Begg family from Badenyon and am in process of trying to find information on the land and buildings at Badenyon. I have several items from Badenyon which have come to me via my father who was a beneficiary in John Begg’s will.&#xa0;We have no details but it is known that there was a court case in the earlier part of the 20th century when we believe that John Begg fought a case against the estate of Glenbuchat that had claimed ownership of Badenyon. During that case, John Begg’s file on the property at Badenyon, which had been deposited with a legal firm in Aberdeen, was lost when in the hands of that legal firm. The ruling of the court is not known but the phrase used by John Begg in his will suggests that he lost his case. I am interested in trying to find out what happened. There is a feeling that the estate possibly grabbed the land and buildings because ownership by the Begg family could not be formally established although they had “owned” Badenyon since 1775.&#xa0;To this end I intend in the very near future to start my inquiry by getting in touch with the Registers of Scotland, hoping that decisions of the court, mentioned above, are lodged there.&#xa0;My niece Norma Begg has uncovered an interesting but inconclusive letter written on precisely the subject of my submission. There is a snippet of information about Badenyon ownership. &#xa0;Someone in Canada has taken time to transcribe letters between Harry Begg and the family in Scotland and post these online. In one particular letter from Charles Begg to Harry, dated "Milltown of Towie 13th July 1835" it states: "John Begg at Badenyon has renewed his lease for nine years and James at Blackhilder has taken his for nineteen. They are still divided on the score of immigration one bad season would send them all scampering over to your land of promise. "&#xa0;http://www.glenbuchatheritage.com/picture/number748.asp&#xa0;I wonder if the lease is for the land or both land and buildings? which leads to the question who built the house and steading at Badenyon and when? and what was the legal position about building on the land at Badenyon? I wonder if the Court case, referred to earlier and held in the earlier part of the 20th Century could refer to this question?&#xa0;When the last owner of Badenyon died, I was in touch with the beneficiary Charles Begg asking if I could help to keep the house in good condition; but he would have none of it, I could put a caravan on the site, he said. An interesting statement in itself. I had no wish to do so at the time for various reasons viz. Aesthetic, no need, and not enough money.&#xa0;October 2013&#xa0;
