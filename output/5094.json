"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Professor Sheila M Bird (BTO0011) 1.1 I am a biostatistician programme-leader at the Medical Research Council’s (MRC) Biostatistics Unit and hold a visiting professorship in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Strathclyde University in Glasgow. My \nbiostatistical\n work on Transmissible Spongiform \nEncephalopathies\n (TSEs) \nand on organ donation and transplantation \nspans two decades. \nI gave evidence to the BSE Inquiry, quantified UK BSE dietary exposure by birth-cohort\n and gender\n, and have been instrumental in European TSE surveillance designs.\n  A\ns a biostatistician\n, I have needed to be deeply immersed\n in, and \nam admiring of\n, TSE science.\nI conducted the 1988-90 confidential audit of all deaths in intensive care units in England and Wales by which relatives’ refusal-rate (then 30%) was quantified and the barriers to organ-specific donation from brain-stem dead potential donors were identified. I have never been a supporter of the NHS Organ Donor Register as opt-out registrations would be many fewer and the associated registration and analyses more manageable. In response to the 2008 report by the Organ Donor Taskforce, Bird and Harris (2010) estimated the plausible gain from presumed consent.\n1.2 In 1988, I joined the MRC’s Working Party on Human Spongif\norm \nEncephalopathies\n. During the next 20 years, I served on a range of sub-committees which dealt with TSEs: in the UK, for MRC, Department of Health (DH), Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC), Health Protection Agency (HPA, now Health Protection England, HPE); in Europe, under the auspices of the Ad Hoc TSE/BSE Subgroup of the European Commission Scientific Steering Committee (1999-2003). In particular, I designed Europe’s late-stage BSE/TSE surveillance in cattle and sheep at abattoirs (which revolutionized understanding of \nscrapie\n epidemiology) and so was \nrapporteur\n on \nRequirements for statistically authoritative BSE-TSE surveys.\n  European Commission, Brussels: November 2001.\n1.3 My research on human TSEs has been funded by the Medical Research Council mainly (and Food Standards Agency) and has focused on two aspects: first, quantification of UK’s dietary BSE exposure by gender and birth-cohort; secondly, the need to increase substantially the extent of human surveillance - by gender, birth-cohort and genotype at \ncodon\n 129 of the \nprion\n protein - for sub-clinical carriage of \nvCJD\n (more specifically: presence of abnormal \nprion\n protein, \nPrP\nSC\n). \n1.4 Cooper and Bird (2003) showed that UK dietary BSE exposure had been greater in the 1940-69 birth-cohort than in those born in 1970-95 and that dietary BSE exposure therefore did not explain the young age of \nvCJD\n cases unless susceptibility to clinical progression from dietary BSE exposure was strongly age-dependent, for example markedly decreased beyond teenage.\n1.5 In committees and publications, I proposed \nPrP\nSC\n surveillance at forensic autopsies, for which an HPA protocol was developed and ethically-approved; but did not proceed. Instead, HPA re-grouped and successfully oversaw \nPrP\nSC\n surveillance by gender and birth-cohort (and with genotyping of \nPrP\nSC\n positives) in 30,000 appendices, results of which were recently published in British Medical Journal. Continuation from 30,000 to at least 100,000 tested appendices was originally envisaged.\n1.6 More controversially, I have also argued that those caught up in \nvCJD\n-at-risk networks who have a guesstimated \nvCJD\n-risk of at least 1% should \neither\n be subject of mandatory forensic post-mortem in the interest of public health \nor at the very least\n be asked to give permission-in-life for \nvCJD\n-informative tests to be done post-mortem in the event of their death and consent-rate monitored. Neither is done.\n1.7 UK’s \nPrP\nSC\n surveillance in appendices suggests that around 1 in 2,000 tests positive.\n1.8 \n If similar surveillance - at autopsy, on \nanonymised\n appendix tissue, or by use of a suitable blood or urine test in \nanonymised\n blood samples from at-risk persons - were applied to those caught up in \nvCJD\n-at-risk networks, then we might expect 1 in 100 to be positive for \nPrP\nSC\n if the 1% assumption were sound.\n1.9 If the 1% expectation proved unsound\n, \nthen the assumptions underlying its\n derivation need revision. But, without empirical evidence from surveillance in those highly-at-risk, there can be no revision. \nW\ne bury and cremate valuable evidence\n on subclinical carriage of \nvCJD\n.\nSUMMARY&#xa0;\nWRITTEN EVIDENCE on \nTOPIC 2 (is Government and its scientific advisory structure sufficiently responsive re \nvCJD\n-risks) &amp; \nTOPIC 3 (has ongoing blood-related transmission of \nvCJD\n been adequately mitigated)\nREFERENCES on \nTOPICS 2 &amp;\n 3Gill ON, Spencer Y, Richard-Loendt A, Kelly C, Dabaghian R, Boyes L, Linehan J, Simmons M, Webb P, Bellerby P, Andrews N, Hilton DA, Ironside JW, Beck J, Poulter M, Mead S, Brandner S.
