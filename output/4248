[normal]“Is the IPCC process an 
[normal]effective mechanism for assessing scientific knowledge?  Or has it focussed on providing a justification for political commitment?”
[normal]Publicly available evidence is described, showing that the IPCC process has always been over presumptive of the scientific k
[normal]nowledge and has failed to ensure that the experts, who serve it, meet the required professional and ethical standards.   The IPCC has conspicuously failed to ensure any compliance with its fundamental principle of requiring a 
[normal]“comprehensive, objective, op
[normal]en and transparent”
[normal] process.   
[normal]“  ..  ..   before we cry "Wolf, wolf", we should have some scientific basis for the cry.  ..  ..  ..”
[normal]The United Kingdom’s presumptions were clear:
[normal]“United Kingdom welcomes this initiative as an important step towa
[normal]rds international consensus.   The United Kingdom government has long expressed its concern about the increase in greenhouse gases. We are committed to action based on sound scientific evidence but the UK believes some action is already justified.  ..  ” 
[normal]Rupert Darwall in his book, 
[normal]‘The Age of Global Warming’,
[normal] has charted the political events, people and environmental movements which led to the establishment of the IPCC.   Discussing Karl Popper’s view of science, Darwell remarks:
[normal] 
[normal]“Science advances throu
[normal]gh challenge but maintaining the consensus subverts the needs of genuine scientific enquiry.   Politicisation of climate science and the de-legitimisation of debate – risks inherent in the idea of global warming – led to a retreat from the standards that e
[normal]merged during the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century to pre-scientific norms; principally, reliance on consensus, peer review and appeals to authority.
[normal]“A
[normal] global warming of larger size has almost certainly occurred at least once since the end of the last glaciation without any appreciable increase in greenhouse gases.   Because we do not understand the reasons for these past warming events it is not yet pos
[normal]sible to attribute a specific proportion of the recent, smaller, warming to an increase of greenhouse gases.”
[normal]Without certainty that late 20th century temperatures and CO
[normal]2
[normal] concentrations are exceptional in this current interglacial period, no rational pers
[normal]on should conclude that CO
[normal]2
[normal] has played a sufficient part in the warming to justify the hugely expensive ‘decarbonisation’ of our economy and lifestyles.
[normal]“It is still not possible to attribute with high confidence all, or even a large part of, the observed global warming to the enhanced greenhouse effect.   On the other hand, it is not possible to refute the claim that 
[normal]greenhouse-gas-induced climate change has contributed substantially to the observed warming.”
[normal]“Nevertheless, the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human inf
[normal]luence on global climate.”
[normal]“It is essential that the chapters not be finalized prior to the completion of the discussions at the IPCC Working Group I plenary in Mad
[normal]rid, and that chapter authors be prevailed upon to modify their text in an appropriate manner following the discussion in Madrid.”
[normal]In his 2008 essay
[normal] on the SAR, Houghton made clear that if what he thought to be the correct science had . . . .
[normal]“not come th
[normal]rough unscathed, the integrity of the panel would have been seriously questioned, and governments would have faltered on taking urgent action on climate change, such as the signing in 1997 of the Kyoto Protocol.”
[normal]"We have to get rid of the Medieval Warm Period."
[normal]Fred Pearce
[normal] also revealed that from 1996 the hunt was on for a ‘hockey stick’.   This suggests
[normal] that a group of IPCC contributors were “
[normal]focussed on providing a justification for political commitment.”
[normal]“Regarding the Hockey Stick of IPCC 2001 evidence now indicates, in my view, that an IPCC Lead Author working with a small coho
[normal]rt of scientists, misrepresented the temperature record of the past 1000 years by (a) promoting his own result as the best estimate, (b) neglecting studies that contradicted his, and (c) amputating another’s result so as to eliminate conflicting data and l
[normal]imit any serious attempt to expose the real uncertainties of these data.”
[normal]“IPCC documents including early drafts and review comments have been freely and widely available - adding much to the credibility of the process and its conclusions.”
[normal]This was untrue.   Only eight boxes of unindexed papers were available
[normal] by appointment at Harvard.
[normal]   A 2009 request to the MO for the TAR documents in their electronic form was refused on spurious grounds.
[normal]   A new request resulted in the release of some of them on 21 November 2013.
[normal]“He pla
[normal]yed no role whatsoever in our chapter. He did not attend any meetings, he did not answer email and he should NOT be listed in my view.”
[normal]Two weeks later the TSU wrote to all REs thanking them but, rather than ask for the ‘written reports’ required by the IP
[normal]CC’s rules, sent each a short prepared statement.   Ignoring the complaint it had just received, the TSU stated,
[normal]“You have already been notified that it was essential to inform us if any serious issues arose in connection with the review process, and none
[normal] of you has indicated any such concerns so we trust that you will sign the attached form letter confirming that all comments were dealt with appropriately.”
[normal]The noncontributing RE returned his signed statement
[normal] and he is improperly listed as a contributor 
[normal]to AR4.
[normal]   A political crisis in the IPCC might well have 
[normal]followed if the RE had been stripped of the kudos of being cited as an IPCC contributor.
