[normal]Written evidence from Liverpool Law Society
[normal] (CMI0026)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]LLS represents over 2500 members of the legal profession in the Merseyside area. Members are solicitors, barristers and academics. This paper has been produced by canvassing the views of members. Most of the information provided is based upon the opinions and experiences of solicitors who are predominantly engaged in the work of personal injury litigation. Contributors include lawyers acting for both insurers and Claimants. At all times LLS has sought to express an impartial view without preference. The views are expressed are therefore not necessarily the views of the author of this document.

[normal]Members of LLS were disappointed to see that some very important issues, particularly those that are set out in the letter from Mrs Louise Ellman MP, Chair, Transport Select Committee to Rt Hon Chris Grayling MP, Minister for Justice, have not been dealt with in the Government’s Command Paper.

[normal]In dealing with those outstanding points, the views of the members of LLS have not changed from the previous submission, a copy of which we have appended for ease of reference.
[normal] The letter of Mr Grayling to Louise Ellman of the 21
[normal]st
[normal] November 2013 has been reviewed and LLS are not necessarily of the view that this represents any significant progression in moving forward in respect of the outstanding issues.

[normal]Of great concern however is the fact that there is no evidence empirical or otherwise that would show that insurers have lowered premiums in the light of the wide reaching changes brought about by LASPO. This was an undertaking that was apparently given in private discussions between insurers and 
[normal]10 Downing Street
[normal] on 14 February 2012. It is disappointing that the meeting was 
[normal]held
[normal] in that way without repr
[normal]esentation for Claimant groups. H
[normal]owever 
[normal]it is a source of some disquiet amongst 
[normal]members  and
[normal] indeed entirely unsatisfactory 
[normal]that the key benefit which the Government claimed would be obtained from insurers has not materialised.
[normal] It does not suffice for Mr Grayling to now say that the “level and timing of any reduction in the cost of motor 
[normal]insurance  premiums
[normal] is a matter for the insurance industry itself” This amounts to a stepping back from a commitment that was made to those who pay for premiums and puts in place a potential for abuse by the insurance industry in respect of the alleged savings that they stated would be made. In terms of confidence in the reforms the MOJ should give consideration to actively seeking specific data rather than relying upon publically available sources. If it is the case that savings have not been made or that they have not been made at the level it was suggested the 
[normal]reform would achieve then members are of the view that potentially both the MOJ and Insurance Industry must be called to account.

[normal]2.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It would equally appear that there has been little effort to develop any form of collaborative approach to tackling fraud for example by the sharing of database information such that claims would not be pursued from the outset were firms in possession of all relevant information. There has been no reasonable justification put forward by Insurers for the withholding of that information. 
[normal]The issue of transparency is addressed by Mr Grayling in his letter of the 21
[normal]st
[normal] November 2013 but whilst he recognises that a lack of openness will cause behaviours to be questioned any decision to take action with regard to improving the position would appear to be delayed pending the outcome of the Competition Commission’s investigation. The opinion expressed by LLS members is that this is inadequate in terms of taking simple steps that could expedite resolution of the perceived fraud problem. Equally should any consultation about the need for greater transparency and information sharing be limited to talks with the ABI and industry regulators that consultation will lose the ability to consider and react to the recommendations made by the practitioners who deal with the problem at a coal face level. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]With regard to fraud and pre-medical offers the members of LLS note that this practice continues unabated and indeed is an increasing trend that contributes to the ability of fraudulent claimants to secure compensation payments. 
[normal]To this end if the MOJ Officials are as suggested by Mr Grayling arranging meetings to discuss this practice with relevant stakeholders LLS would seek confirmation that the stakeholder group will be wide ranging in the parties that are represented and indeed would welcome involvement with that consultation given the prevalence of civil litigation within the Merseyside area.
