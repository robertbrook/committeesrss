Supplementary written evidence from the British Councildefault&#xa0;defaultCreating Opportunities for UK Providers Worldwidedefault&#xa0;
defaultOur Purpose
default&#xa0;
defaultThe British Council shares the UK’s great cultural assets: the English language, arts, education and ways of living and organising society with the world. This: 
default&#xa0;
default1.
default              
defaultBuilds trust in the people and institutions of the UK and supports prosperity and security around the world, 
default2.
default              
defaultEncourages people to visit, study in, and do business with the UK, 
default3.
default              
defaultAttracts people who really matter to our future to visit and engage with the UK.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe trust generated by our work has a clear positive impact on people and governments’ willingness to do business with UK companies and institutions.  Our research shows our work significantly increases the interest in the UK, and UK providers, creating opportunities for UK businesses. 
default&#xa0;
defaultEnglish is central to our work
default&#xa0;
defaultAll cultural bodies worldwide start from sharing their language – the UK is immensely fortunate that English is ours. Nothing builds trust more effectively or is wanted more consistently from the UK worldwide, than our expertise and help in the English language. Some of this the British Council can deliver on behalf of the UK, a lot of it we do in partnership with other UK providers – exam boards, universities and private sector. But there is much more the UK could do, particularly in the state and public education systems of developing and emerging economies. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe estimate over 1.5 billion people are learning English, one in seven of the world's 
defaultpopulation. 
defaultOf these, about 50 million people globally learn English through commercial teaching centres.  The British Council has 1% of this market with our face-to-face teaching centres in 60 countries. However, we reach hundreds of millions more with our LearnEnglish websites for children, teens and adults, with wind-up MP3 players in Africa and via radio, television and social media worldwide in partnerships with the BBC, Premier League and others.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe develop teachers and teaching resources in our large-scale English teaching operations in Western Europe, Asia, the Middle East and North Africa which are self-funding with no cross-subsidy from UK taxpayers. The resources we create in these larger operations enable us to reach and teach English in places few other organisations could – in conflict zones and developing countries throughout Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, the Middle East and North Africa; in countries like Afghanistan and South Sudan and in vital institutions for peace, governance and security like Egypt’s Al-Azhar University, military colleges and civil service academies. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe use our English teaching expertise to open up other relationships for the UK with Ministries of Education.  These enable us to work across state education sectors improving quality and building capacity in teaching, teacher training, curriculum development, assessment and other areas. As an example, in Malaysia, we are working across 600 schools in Borneo to improve classroom teaching and learning of English and using a mentorship approach which will embed continuous teacher development and relationships long after the end of the project.  
default&#xa0;
defaultBritish Council English teachers are world-renowned and form a top quality source of highly trained internationally mobile talent for other UK institutions and English providers - many of which are run by and employ former British Council teachers and teacher trainers.  Within our pool of over 2,000 
defaultteahers
default we have a healthy annual turnover of around 20%, of which we 
defaultestimate about 15% go into other jobs with other providers in the sector. Others go into academic research posts and contribute to English Language Teaching research, advancing the quality of English learning worldwide.
default&#xa0;
defaultExamples 
default&#xa0;
defaultPiloting in the Americas, we have reframed our offer to governments and ministries to bring together the UK’s many strengths in both public education and English 
defaultteaching. 
defaultNew web pages set out the opportunity for UK 
defaultproviders and
default presents to governments throughout the Americas the potential for complete UK-led, partnered and supplied solutions to these countries’ education needs for English, bilingualism and broader education – all the way from skills to Higher Education. 
default&#xa0;
default•
default              
defaultWe work in partnership with others to deliver English Language contracts overseas in support of education reform in other countries, partners like Universities UK, HE institutions (Norwich Institute of Education, MARJON University, University of Wolverhampton, and University of Chichester), VSO, International House, Pearson, BELL Foundation and EAQUALS (quality and language assessment association).
default&#xa0;
default•
default              
defaultWe manage and distribute UK based exams internationally. This provides annual export earnings of over £70m to UK exam boards and professional bodies.
default&#xa0;
default•
default              
defaultWe jointly manage the Accreditation UK scheme with English UK. We accredit over 550 UK schools, colleges and universities as providers of quality English language learning, a powerful marketing tool for this £3billion UK business
default&#xa0;
default•
default              
defaultWe support and broker opportunities for the UK English Language Teaching sector in priority markets like China where we tender teacher development work to the UK sector on behalf of Chinese institutions. In other contexts, e.g. India we arrange seminars on market opportunities for UK providers.  We publish market reports for the sector on key markets.  This support and brokerage has led to numerous new contracts and business for British organisations. In Africa, for example, our work has helped to double the business for Cambridge International Exams in Nigeria.
default&#xa0;
defaultFair Trading 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have very clear policies on Fair 
defaultTrading and
default a strong organisational commitment to increasing opportunity internationally for UK providers. We deliver our charitable objectives with grant-in-aid from UK Government and also through partnerships, contracts and ‘paid for’ activities and we recognise that in carrying out our activities there may be an impact on other parties, including suppliers, competitors and partners.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn response, the British Council adheres to all applicable legal requirements in our trading activities. We ensure operational and financial separation between State-funded activity and revenue generating activity through robust accounting firewalls and appropriate organisational structures. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have clarified our guidance on when we can help UK organisations, and when we cannot given finite resources and our charitable purpose and 
defaultmandate. 
defaultWe offer a mix of free and ‘paid for’ services to support UK education providers of Education, English and Examination services, but we cannot offer free, unlimited promotion of one individual organisation’s products or services. We can offer support to UK providers under contract or on a ‘paid for’ basis where this does not conflict with our charitable purpose and does not unfairly disadvantage other UK providers.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn summary 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe British Council builds the trust and creates the conditions for the success of UK providers. We are working hard with them to showcase the whole UK Education sector’s many strengths to overseas governments and agencies - all to create more exports, prosperity, security, opportunities and trust for the UK worldwide.

defaultQ94/95
default – 
defaultUnion membership
default and staff
default associations
defaultThe British Council recognises the advantage of staff joining trade unions or staff associations. Our employment relations policy is that we consult with unions and staff associations on proposed changes which may have significant implications for staff. As a global standard we will have a mechanism in all our operations, however small, to consult with staff on any such proposals, including the proposed timeframe for the implementation for change. It is British Council policy that changes to terms and conditions of employment, which include pay reviews, are always subject to consultation with staff and their representatives.
default 
defaultIn the UK we have a collective bargaining agreement with the PCS union. 
defaultAs of the end of August, the percentage of UK appointed staff that were members of a union was 45.8%. 
defaultStaff representation overseas will vary and reflect local practice and legislation. The management of a staff association will vary depending on the size of the office. In a small office, it might be a simple and informal process where staff elect one or two staff representatives on an annual basis. In a larger office, a more formal approach might be taken. 
defaultDetails on local membership levels and management arrangements are not held centrally.
defaultIn the UK and overseas we review staff pay annually and a review is subject to consultations with trade unions and staff associations. Typically the areas we would consult on are the outcomes of salary benchmarking against the market, changes to pay policy and uplifts to pay bands. In the UK the PCS union provides the British Council with a pay claim which forms the basis of initial consultations. In the UK and overseas pay claims and final pay offers are shared with staff as part of the consultation process.
defaultWe seek to be an attractive and fair employer and to demon
defaultstrate good employer practice. For example, a
defaultl
defaultl our staff in the UK are paid 
defaultthe living wage. We also offe
defaultr paid internships which enable
default people from a diversity of backgrounds to take up these opportunities. We are also particularly proud of our family friendly policies
default,
default which include
default flexible working, attractive maternity and paternity benefits and support t
defaultowards the cost of childcare.
