RCH0007default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultWritten evidence submitted by the defaultChildren’s Services Development Groupdefault&#xa0;defaultThis briefing set
defaults out the views of the Children’s Services Development Group (CSDG) regarding the Government’s planned reforms
default to the regulation of residential children’s homes. It addresses the two questions posed by the Education Select Committee: 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Children’s Services Development Group (CSDG) welcomes the intention of the proposed reforms to the regulation of children’s homes, but is concerned that the narrow focus of the proposed changes will
default not be effective in ensuring that the system protects vulnerable children and acts in their best interests.
default&#xa0;
defaultOur concerns stem from both the exclusive focus on out-of-authority placements in children’s homes, which risks ignoring the majority of vulnerabl
defaulte children, and from the decision to simply increase regulation when care failings are caused by existing regulations not being followed.

default&#xa0;defaultQ.1 defaultAredefault the DfE’s proposed reforms to the regulation of residential children’s homes appropriate and sufficientdefault?default&#xa0;defaultThe Children’s Services 
defaultDevelopment Group (CSDG) welcomes the intention of the proposed reforms to the regulation of children’s homes, but is concerned that the narrow focus of the proposed changes will not be effective in ensuring that the system protects vulnerable children and
default acts in their best interests.
default&#xa0;
defaultAll children should have safe, effective care whether in fostering, kinship care or children’s homes, and whether placed in- or out-of-area. 
defaultMany children at risk will still be living with their birth families, as was the ca
defaultse in Rochdale and in Oxfordshire, and the regulation does nothing to safeguard them.
default Rather, it detracts attention from them, and so makes it less likely that abuse will be noticed and acted upon. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultDfE itself recognised that the 
defaultexisting notification
default process is not always followed, and our concern is that whilst the intentions are good, in practice the changes will not have an impact or could in fact make it worse by delaying children and young people’s access to needed support.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is nothing in t
defaulthe proposed reforms that makes it more likely that regulations will be implemented effectively. Where the proposed reforms are followed, they have the potential to introduce significant delay to the system. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe involvement of the Director of Children’s S
defaultervices and the need to consult the area authority should not be allowed to needlessly delay placement decisions being made, whilst the child or young person has to 
defaultremain in a short-term placement and cope with the uncertainty of not knowing where they wi
defaultll be living. Target timescales for the placement decision process should be set out and consideration should be given to the impact a temporary placement will have or be having whilst decisions are being made.
default&#xa0;defaultBelow we set out our response to specific parts of the proposed reforms: 
default&#xa0;defaultRisk assessmentsdefault&#xa0;defaultCSDG would welcome clear guidance on what should be included in risk assessments, which is currently lacking. CSDG members have recently trialled risk assessments 
defaultand have been met with very varied responses from police services and local authorities. There needs to be requirements on all parties to co-operate, not just children’s homes, for this to be effective. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOngoing communication between agencies, not just at
default the beginning of a placement or at annual reviews, is essential. Where one party becomes aware of a risk in a local area this should be communicated to all as it arises and acted upon to safeguard all vulnerable children in the area, not just those in chi
defaultldren’s homes. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhere homes are inadequate or located in unsafe areas, this must be addressed and quickly, but the majority of children’s homes provide young people with intensive and specialist therapeutic support that will enable them to live fulfilled 
defaultadult lives. The DfE’s own data shows that 71% of children’s homes are rated good or outstanding, and there is no direct correlation between level of deprivation and location of children’s homes. 
defaultWhere local authorities lack provision, and so turn to out-o
defaultf-area placements, we would encourage them to work in partnership with providers to develop high quality provision that meets children’s needs. 
default&#xa0;defaultDistancedefault&#xa0;
defaultThe focus on out-of-area placements ignores the risks to all vulnerable and looked-after children, many of whom will already have a history of neglect or abuse before entering care. All placement decisions should be carefully planned and considered, in par
defaulttnership between local authorities, providers and other agencies, in order to support children in safe and therapeutic environments to achieve good outcomes. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe most important consideration is that a placement meets the needs of a child and is in their 
defaultbest interests. Distance is just one factor in this. Indeed, it can be necessary to use out-of-area placements in order to access specialist provision – especially 
defaultfor looked-after children with special educational needs
default – or to remove a young people from 
defaultharmful environment for their own protection and wellbeing.
default&#xa0;
defaultPlacement decisions must be in the best interests of the child, and not based on short-term costs. Research by the LGiU shows that 86% of local authorities say that achieving excellent outcomes i
defaults their priority in commissioning, but for 40% or more of all placement decisions, cost is their primary concern.
default&#xa0;
defaultDistance in itself need not have a negative impact as long as good contact and communication between agencies is well maintained. Some local
default authorities do not establish this communication and multi-agency approach for children in-authority and the focus on out-of-area placements risks ignoring the needs of all vulnerable children.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn determining whether there is a ‘correct’ level of out-of-a
defaultrea placements, it is necessary to look at the reasons why each child is being placed out-of-area and the provision they are accessing. Where shortages in 
defaultcapacity 
defaultexist, local authorities should look to work with providers to develop services that, in tim
defaulte, will meet the needs of the local population
default, using demographic data to plan for the future
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultCare leaversdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe presumption should always be that young people will leave care later than age
defaultd 
default17, and any decisions for a young person to leave before that s
defaulthould be exceptional circumstances. Local authorities, working in partnership with providers, should regularly review the type of support young people are receiving and how this meets their current needs and prepares them for independent adult life. 
default&#xa0;
defaultLeav
defaulting care is too often treated as an event, not a process. Planning for care leaving should start early and the intensity of support phased to help young people adjust to increasing levels of independence. This would help ensure corporate parents mirror the
default kind of support offered by birth families, and would improve outcomes in education, training and employment for looked-after children.
default&#xa0;
defaultRaising the care leaving age would be more effective
default than simply requiring sign off
default. Decisions about care leaving are 
defaultstill too often driven by short-term cost factor and not long-term outcomes for young people.
default&#xa0;defaultWorkforcedefault&#xa0;
defaultCSDG broadly welcomes the proposals to increase the quality and level of qualifications of the care workforce. 
defaultIt is important that all looked-after c
defaulthildren have access to high quality care, and qualified staff is one of the key factors in achieving this. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, up-skilling the workforce will require significant resource investment and it is not clear whether Government, provider or the individual
default will be asked to meet the cost of training. In addition to this, better qualified staff will attract higher salaries, which may have a knock on impact on the cost of provision and must be incorporated into local authorities’ commissioning. 
defaultRecent cdefaultommentdefaults from defaultEducation Secretarydefault defaultMichael GovedefaultCSDG were very disappointed to read the Education Secretary’s recent article in the Daily Telegraph, which was misleading and
default harmfully
default sensationalist.
default In a number of instances data

defaultfrom the DfE’s 
defaultChildren’
defaults Homes D

defaultack
default was,
default willfully or mistakenly,
default misrepresented
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe DfE’s own data shows that 71% of children’s homes are rated good or outstanding, and there is no direct correlation between level of deprivation and location of children’s homes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQuality is not
default a question of whether the provider a local authority or independent provider. Indeed, independent homes were less likely to be rated inadequate, and cost on average over £14,000 less per child per year, than local authority-run homes. Quality is a questio
defaultn of whether a placement meets the often complex needs of a vulnerable child in a safe and fulfilling environment. 
defaultQ.2 defaultAre the reformsdefault likely to prove effectivedefault or further measures are needed?defaultCSDG welcome the intentions of these changes to i
defaultmprove multi-
defaultagency working and
default communication. However, current problems in the system are often caused by poor implementation and so changing regulations may not have much impact without also looking at the way local authorities commission services and communicate wit
defaulth providers and other agencies. 
default&#xa0;
defaultRevising regulations without acting to ensure effective implementation and better strategic commissioning of placements will not truly make a difference in the lives of children in the care system. 
default&#xa0;
defaultBetter commissioning a
defaultnd collaborative, constructive relationships with providers are needed to ensure that placements work to support, encourage and safeguard looked-after children in their care, as well as to develop the right kind of provision locally to meet their needs. 
defaultWithout this foundation of better commissioning and a 
defaultmore 
defaultpositive attitude to partnership working, the regulations will not be effective and in some local authorities, short-term costs, not the value of long-term outcomes, will continue to drive decision
defaults. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWithout a wider strategic approach to the care system, the Department for Education is simply tinkering with isolated parts of the s
defaultystem – such as the adoption reforms – which will mean nothing for the majority of children in care. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSpecifically the way children’s homes 
defaultare used in the care system needs to be reviewed. 
defaultThe Department for Education has recognised that too often children’s homes are used by local authorities as a ‘last resort’. 7,900 of the 67,000 looked-after children 
defaultin England are cared for in residential homes,
default and 
defaultCSDG
default believe
defaults
default that residential care can and should play a vital role as part of a range of provision for children with complex needs.
default&#xa0;
defaultMany young people in residential homes will have had multiple placeme
defaultnt breakdowns and often have the most complex needs. Statistics released in the 
defaultChildren’s Homes Data Pack
default show that nearly a third of children in children’s homes have had 6 or more placements.
default This is 
defaultthe real
default scandal, with poor commissioning denying ch
defaultildren stable and secure placements that
default meet their needs, and robbing them of positive outcomes. 
default&#xa0;
defaultRecent parliamentary questions have revealed that the Department for Education decided against developing a care strategy.
default Instead the department has chosen to implement piecemeal reforms – such as to the adoption system – which makes no difference to the majority of looked-after children. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe would encourage the Education Select Committee to ask the Government to rethink th
defaultis decision as a matter of urgency and take a strategic approach to reforming the wider care system, rather than making piecemeal changes in isolation. Only by doing so will they safeguard vulnerable children and help to provide the high-quality care and s
defaultupport they deserve.
