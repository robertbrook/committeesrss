"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the Ministry of Justice&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTRANSFORMING REHABILITATION: EVIDENCE SESSIONIn advance of the session on 4 December the Committee has been invited to \nan informal briefing session with senior officials from the Department about the \nreforms.\nIn thi\ns briefing, I have asked \nofficials to focus on the progress that has been made in the Transforming \nRehabilitation Programme so far and the work that the Department has been doing with Probation Trusts to prepare them for the transition to the new system. Jeremy \nand I will then pick up any other questions you have during our evidence session.\nI know that you have also asked for sight of the Programme's risk register in advance \nof our evidence session. The process of identifying and managing potential risks to \nthe delivery of any programme is an ongoing process, as is establishing activities \nwhich mitigate those risks. Doing so is good practice and in the public interest, and it \nis my view that the public interest is ultimately best served by doing so in a protected \nenvironment. This allows for full and frank evaluation to take place and, for this \nreason, I am unable to provide you with the risk register at this stage. My officials will \nobviously be able to talk to you about the high level risks that they are managing and \nmitigating against, but they will not share detail on the risk register itself with the \nCommittee.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;November 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
