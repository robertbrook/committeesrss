defaultThank you for your letter of 16 December about your Committee’s inquiry into the effects of the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act 2011 on the final year 
defaultof a parliament.
defaultAs I am sure others will have said to you, as this is Westminster’s first experience of a fixed term parliament we will not know its effects on our work until we actually experience it. In addition, it cannot be examined in isolation from 
defaultother changes and the political climate. For example, if most of the members of a committee are standing again and if the Chair intends to run for a second term I would expect the dynamic to be different to a committee where the majority of members and the
default chair were standing down or moving on to other committees, if re-elected at the general election.
defaultIn the pre-2010 parliaments when we reached this point and we were not sure when parliament would be dissolved there was a quickening in the pace of work as 
defaultMembers sought to launch and complete inquiries until the dissolution was announced. At this point I do not feel the pace to be increasing markedly. There is some pressure to ensure that what are likely to be politically contentious inquiries are completed
default well before the election, not least because we are a committee that has operated largely by consensus. 
defaultFrom the summer it may be the case that Members concentrate more on their constituencies ahead of what promises to be a hard fought election and for th
defaulte Committee to inquire into subjects that are less party politically contentious. In contrast to the period since 1945 we currently have a coalition government and this will impact on the last year of the parliament as the parties in government seek to dis
defaulttinguish themselves from each other and set out their separate programmes.
defaultGiven the Liaison Committee's emphasis that committees should seek to operate more strategically than in the past I would like to see two developments. First, from the autumn I can 
defaultsee some benefit in my committee engaging with those with an interest in our work―local authorities, agencies, professionals and the public―to see what impact we have had, what we got right and what we could have done differently. Second, I would like to p
defaultass the fruit of our work on to our successor committee in the 2015 parliament. In the past I feel that the arrangements for achieving this have been weak and, especially, when there is substantial change of membership, valuable collective experience and e
defaultxpertise is lost.
