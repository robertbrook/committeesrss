"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written evidence from the Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC) (SLC 024)Introduction 1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nATOC's mission\n \nis\n to champion the interests of passenger rail operators in serving customers and supporting a safe, reliable, attractive and prosperous railway\n. Set up after privatisation in 1993, we bring together all train companies to preserve and enhance the benefits f\nor passengers of Britain’s national rail network. We also run joint industry services, including National Rail Enquiries, the Rail Settlement Plan and the discount Railcard schemes\n and the provision of expert services in \np\nolicy, operations, engineering and\n project management\n.\n \n2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe welcome the chance to submit evidence to the Committee’s inquiry\n. \nIn general, it is\n road users\n who are most likely to be injured or killed by accidents at level crossings.  However\n,\n there are cases where a collision between a train\n and a road vehicle has resulted in a derailment and subsequent multiple fatalities and serious injuries to a train’s passengers and crew, Ufton Nervet in 2004 being the most recent UK example. In addition, a number of train drivers have been killed in col\nlisions where there were no passenger fatalities due to their location at the very front of the train. Train drivers and others can also suffer serious psychological or psychiatric injury after witnessing an accident at a level crossing\n.\n3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAccording to the \nOffice of Rail Regulation\n (ORR)\n, the independent safety and economic regulator for Britain's railways, there are approximately 9\n,\n000 level crossings in Great Britain.\n Network Rail manages just over 6\n,\n500 active, open crossings.\n The rest are located on he\nritage railways, metro systems and industrial railways.\nAre current safety measures at level crossings adequate? How should they be improved? 4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe\n evidence suggests that \nBritain’s mainline railway is the best in the EU at managing risks at level crossings.\n \nT\nhis is a conclusion reached by the ORR and their \nHealth and Safety Report 2013\n \nrecords that there has been a long-term trend of decreasing risk at level crossings and that Network Rail is on-target to meet its 25% reduction in level crossing risk over Co\nntrol Period 4 (CP4) 2009-14, as measured by its own model.\n \nThis view\n is echoed by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch who \nfind \nthat the UK’s mainline railway has a good overall level crossing safety record relative to the other European Union Member \nStates.\n \n&#xa0;\n5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhere should be no complacency\n.\n \nBritain’s level crossings still account for nearly half of the catastrophic train accident risk on the railway\n and \n there were nine level cros\nsing user fatalities in 2012/13 \n- four pedestrians users and five road \nvehicle users.\n \n There were also seven major \ninjuries, 53 reported minor injuries and 17 reports of shock or trauma. There were ten collisions between trains and road vehicles. The total amount of harm at level crossings in 2012/13 showed an increase compa\nred with the last two years, but was below the ten-year average. There were no passenger or workforce fatalities and the last level crossing accident resulting in train occupant fatalities occurred in 2004.\n&#xa0;\n6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFurther improvements\n \ncould be made by\n new equip\nment, better management,\n closer working and a clearer division of responsibilities between Network Rail and those responsible for roads\n,\n and a general simplification of legal processes governing the closure of level crossings. \nThe challenge is to deliver i\nmprovement at an affordable cost.\n \nNetwork Rail is spending £130m to improve level crossing safety during Control Period 4 (1 April 2009 - 31 March 2014).\nIn addition to bridges and underpasses what other cost-effective measures can be introduced to replace or improve safety at level crossings?7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEvery level crossing \nhas\n specific risks associated with it\n, determined\n by crossing type, location,\n amount and type of use,\n \nand other local factors. \nSafety risk can \nsometimes \nbe reduced by \nchanging\n the crossing type \nus\ned in a particular location, but doing so \ncan be expensive\n and not \nproportionate to the reduction\n in risk\n achieved. \nIn some locations more modest changes, such as removing obstructions from sight lines, improving the visibility of road traffic signals and \nincreas\ning the audibility of train horns,\n \nmay be more appropriate and cost effective. The rail industry, through \nNetwork Rail\n,\n is taking a number of steps to achieve further safety improvements, including:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAccidents are not just caused by technical or physical problems at the location, but also by user b\nehaviour which the rail industry has sometimes little or no ability to influence. \n Pedestrians and car users take risks and make misjudgements. \nWe look forward to the publication of research into user behaviour by the Rail Safety and Standards Board next y\near. We hope any cost-effective recommendations will be implemented without unnecessary delay. \nHow should expenditure on improving safety at level crossings be prioritised in relation to other demands on the rail budget?9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe rail industry uses s\nophisticated models \n(e.g. the \nRSSB’s\n Precursor Indicator Model) \nto understand the risks it manages and to prioritise risk reduction.\n \nFurther improving safety at level crossings should \nremain \na priority given they \nremain a significant\n train accident risk on\n \nthe railway\n. The \nGovernment’s 2012 High Level Output Statement \nma\nde\n a\n welcome\n ring-fenced provision of £65m over Control Period 5 i\nn accordance with advice from\n the\n ORR\n.\n \n10.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe benefits resulting \nfrom improvements to level crossings are not limited to \nincreased safety and reduced risk. For the railway, improvements can lead to quicker journey times through fewer speed restrictions and lower maintenance and staffing costs (depending on the improvement made). At the same time there are often\n benefits to r\noad users, in the form of reduced delays and a better flow of traffic. Given the benefits of improvements are shared between rail and road and that \nl\nevel crossing accidents tend to \ninvolve road users and \npedestrians rather than rail passengers\n, \nthere \nis \na \nstrong \ncase for \nusing the\n roads budget \nto supplement the existing commitment from\n \nthe \nrail budget\n to fund further improvements.\n&#xa0;\nIs Network Rail giving sufficient priority to improving safety at level crossings?11.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nYes. \nNetwork Rail has \ndemonstrably\n increased the focus it places on improving safety at level crossings.  As noted above,\n Network Rail is on-target to meet its 25% reduction in level crossing risk over Control Period 4 (CP4) 2009-14\n and\n \nhas \ncommitted to achieve \na \nfurther 25% reduction in l\nevel crossing risk \nby 2019. We welcome this continued commitment and focus\n.\n&#xa0;Is Government policy and regulatory action by the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) in relation to safety at level crossings adequate? What more should the Government and ORR do?&#xa0;12.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe ORR makes conclusions and recommendations about the performance of Network Rail in its \na\nnnual Health and Safety Report, but does not provide enough detailed information to judge whether their activity is ‘adequate’. The fact that Britain compares favou\nrably to European comparators and Network Rail is delivering against \nits\n targets \ndoes \nsuggest that UK arrangements are working\n well.\n \n&#xa0;\n13.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe ORR \nhas set out its policy on level crossings and has produced \ndetailed helpful \nguidance on the safe management, \noperation, modification and use level crossings for managers, designers and operators.\n We agree with the ORR that\n impro\nving safety at level crossings\n should not be a solely rail industry responsibility\n,\n but needs to involve traffic authorities and other relevant organisations.\n&#xa0;\n14.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe ORR does occasionally use its formal powers to ensure compliance with the law or deal with immediate risk. For example, they completed a \nsuccessful \nprosecution of Network Rail\n for a \nf\nailure to address concerns about sighting at a level crossing, resulting in the death of pedestrian using a footpath\n,\n for which Network Rail were fined £356\n,\n250.\n&#xa0;\n15.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Government’s 2012 High Level Output Statement stated that: \n‘the Secretary of Sta\nte wishes the industry to reduce the risk of accidents at level crossings and is making a ring-fenced funding provision for this purpose.’\n \nWe welcome the ring-fencing of £6\n5\nm between 2014 and 2019  for this purpose. \nHow should the legislation governing level crossings be updated?16.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Law Commission and Scottish Law Commission are \nreviewing the law relating to level crossings, which they describe as \n‘complex, outdated and difficult to access, creating problems for regulators, owners and operators and incr\neasing the safety risk for users.\n \nA\n consultation paper\n \nwas published in July 2010, followed by a four month consultation period. T\nhe Law Commission’s website\n states that \nParliamentary counsel have drafted a Bill and Regulations to give effect to their reco\nmmendations and a report containing the recommendations will published in the autumn.\n We expect the Law Commission will \nrecommend\n a consolidation and simplification of existing \nlegislation\n and \nhope that \nthe new legislative framework will encourage \ngreater \ncollaboration between rail and road authorities in managing level crossing risk. \nIt is frustrating that progress has not been quicker.\nHow should public awareness of safety at level crossings be improved?17.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNetwork Rail \nundertakes national and local p\nublic \nawareness activity\n, including at level crossing sites\n.\n \nWe believe there is scope for \njoint\n work\ning and campaigns\n with bodies \nwith experience of road safety public awareness\n (e.g. local authorities, Think!,\n and\n the police) \nbecause Netw\no\nrk Rail does not have\n sole responsibility for safety at level crossings.\n Campaigns should be targeted at the most vulnerable users\n – irregular \nand\n irregular users -\n based on the evidence.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://lawcommission.justice.gov.uk/docs/cp194_Level_Crossings_Consultation.pdf\n \nhttp://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/server/show/nav.1134\n \n http://www.networkrail.co.uk/level-crossings/\n \nhttp://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/pdf/health-safety-report-2013.pdf\n \nhttp://www.raib.gov.uk/cms_resources.cfm?file=/121213_AR2011_Section_1.pdf\n \nhttp://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/server/show/nav.1134\n \nhttp://www.rssb.co.uk/SPR/REPORTS/Documents/ASPR_2012-13_Fu\nllReport.pdf\n \nhttp://www.rssb.co.uk/SPR/REPORTS/Documents/ASPR_2012-13_FullReport.pdf\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/3641/railways-act-2005.pdf\n \nhttp://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/pdf/level_crossings_guidance.p\ndf\n \nhttp://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/pdf/health-safety-report-2013.pdf\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/3641/railways-act-2005.pdf\n"
