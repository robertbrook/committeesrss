Will those who don't have time to respond until the last minute have their responses duly considered with equal weight to those submitted before papers were prepared for the policy board meeting scheduled on 10/12/13? Due to the new timetable this matter will now be dealt with by a Special Policy Board on 17th December. A number of other authorities are also holding additional Cabinet or Executive meetings to meet the timeframeWhich working groups and scrutiny committees are dealing with this issue?None - due to the imposition of further consultation requirements there is insufficient time to refer this matter to a working group or for pre-scrutiny. There is however a Peoples Panel scheduled for 12th DecemberWho are their members, and where can their minutes be found?N/aIf there is no longer going to be a chief executive's post, who will take his place alongside the leader since\"the Chief Executive be authorised, in consultation with the Leader, to agree the terms of any documentation required to enable the Authority to become a constituent authority of the Combined Authority including the constitutional arrangements\" (REPORT OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVECreation of a Combined Authority, presented to Policy Board 24/6/13) ?this will now fall to the Head of Paid Service Mr Steven Mason.The agenda papers for the Policy Board meeting of 17 December will be available on the Council’s website from Tuesday, 10 December.&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDear Cllrs Davey, Jackson, and Reid,\nAs promised in my online response to the Combined Authority local consultation, please find attached further details.\nI am not completely \nnegative about this, but I am extremely concerned that the rural communities of Northumberland and County Durham will have no voice, particularly with regard to public transport, and also because we have already ended up in a unitary county authority witho\nut residents being able to vote on it.\nOur democratic powers seem to be moving further and further away from us.\nIn particular, of the two existing and three proposed combined authorities, \nNorthumberland and County Durham would be the first 2 predominantly rural authorities to enter into such an arrangement. \nI therefore think that there should be two representatives for Northumberland, one for the 50% of the population who live in the southeast and one for the 50% of the population who live in the rural communities. Maybe there should be the same arrangement for rural County Durham as well, so that there would at least be some rural voice, even if it was still without any power compared to all of the other urban representatives.\nAt the very least, there should be an effective trial period and means of opting out for the rural areas of Northumberland and County Durham if this arrangement is found not to be working for them. Before this proposal is allowed to proceed any further there should also be a\n guaranteed level of service, investment, and protection from cutbacks for each community, particularly small rural ones, many of which are already left with only the barest remnants of the services which they once had.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nNorthumberland County Council       \nCombined Authority Local Consultation,  Deadline 11/12/13:&#xa0;\nThinking about the seven local authority areas of Durham, Gateshead, Newcastle, Northumberland, North Tyneside, South Tyneside and Sunderland...\nthe provision of economic development and regeneration \nYes\n...the effectiveness and efficiency of transport \nNothe overall economic conditions \nY\nes\nPlease tell us whyA)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIT WOULD NOT PROVIDE EFFECTIVE REPRESENTATION AND SCRUTINY FOR THE NEEDS OF RURAL COMMUNITIES.\nB)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNOT ENOUGH PEOPLE HAVE HAD A P\nROPER CHANCE TO FIND OUT ABOUT THE CONSULTATION AND RESPOND, THOUGH MANY WOULD PROBABLY HAVE VERY STRONG OPINIONS IF THEY KNEW ABOUT IT.\n&#xa0;\nA)In \nt\nhe proposed form, if this doesn't work, we wou\nld not have the money for the legal process to reverse it.  W\ne sh\nould be able to have some \nso\nrt\n \nof trial period before committing.  In particular, of the \ntwo\n existing and \nthree\n proposed combined authorities, \nNorthumberland and County Durham would be the first 2 predominantly rural authorities to enter into such a\nn \narrangement\n.  It is already difficult for rural voices to be heard in these counties, because rural people without decent computer services and broadband, and with little or no public tran\ns\nport access to public meetings and libraries, cannot take an equal \npart in consultations or effectively observe what is being \ndecided in their name.  Given \nthat\n five out of the seven authorities proposed for the North East leadership board are urban, and if the  L\neader of \nNorthumberland County Council\n is from the \nurban\n ar\nea of the county,\n \nas is currently and has previously \nvery \noften been the case\n, there  would be \nno voice speaking up for the communities in the 97% of the county which is classed as rural, and the 50 % of the population who live \nthere, rather than in \nthe 3%\n of urban land found in the south east of the county\n [N.C.C. website, key statistics about Northumberland].\n&#xa0;\nHaving worked for almost ten years in Morpeth, the site of County Hall and on the boundary between the rural southeast and the rest of Northumberla\nnd, it has become obvious to me that \ndespite its situation, \nmost people in Morpeth are not familiar with the location of most of the villages in the rural areas  which lie beyond three or four miles north and west of the town, and they certainly have littl\ne or no idea about the lives and work of the people who live there, or what services they may or may not have left to them.  If this is the case in Morpeth, on the edge of the rural area, there is little chance that anyone based in the south east of the co\nunty, and from that culture, has any real appreciation of the nature and needs of rural communities, even if they have the best intentions, and have been dealing with council business for the whole of their working lives.\nWhen the Unitary Authority was cre\nated in Northumberland, there was no official poll, and despite all of the unofficial polls appearing to show that about 90% of Northumberland residents objected to a Unitary Authority, those who had the power to do so forced it through anyway against\n the \nwishes\n of most residents\n.\n Now, for certain issues, \nthe majority of those \non the North East Leadership Board \nwho are shaping crucial policies in our name are going to be impossibly remote should we wish to contact them or observe what is being done in our n\name.  At present, if public transport allows, I can get to County Hall to observe a Policy Board or full Council meeting. It is almost certain that it will be too time consuming \nand expensive \nfor me to go to observe a North\n East L\neadership Board meeting, e\nven if \nI was allowed to, given that a high proportion of the matters being discussed under the headings of economic development and regeneration and transport are likely to be commercially sensitive.  It is likely to be remote \neven from my own County Counc\nil\nlor.\n  It is unlikely that the representatives of e.g. Sunderland and Newcastle could have any useful insight into the needs of e.g. Berwick\n-upon-Tweed and the north of Northumberland, which would most probably benefit from making better connections with \nScotland rather than areas south of the Tyne anyway.\nI think that there should be two representatives for Northumberland, one for the 50% of the population who live in the southeast and one for the 50% of the population who live in the rural communities. Maybe there should be the same arrangement for rural County Durham as well, so that there would at least be some rural voice, even if it was still without any power compared to all of the other urban representatives.At the very least\n, there should be an effective trial period and means of opting out for the rural areas of Northumberland and County Durham if this arrangement is found not to be working for them. Before this proposal is allowed to proceed any further there should also be a guaranteed level of service, investment, and protection from cutbacks for  each community, particularly small rural ones, many of which are already left with only the barest remnants of the services which they once had.&#xa0;Although described in strict accuracy as voluntary, th\nis appears to be more a coerced response to current government policy which works against the interests of remote regions and communities\n.  A proposal which is designed less in response to Westminster short termism and more as something which has had time to be thoroughly and carefully considered and has grown out of the true long term needs of the region would serve us better.&#xa0;B)              There is not enough detail in the current consultation for us to be able to give a properly informed response,\n and as usual, n\next to no\n-\none who I have spoken to in the last week has any idea that this is happening, although the\ny do have strong views about it when asked.\n  Though the consultation is on the front page of the Northumberland County Council website, it only says consul\ntation and does not say what it is about until people actually go into it. Though many would be likely to have strong feelings about it, they are not likely to go into it unless they are already in the know.  It does not appear in the alerts at the top of \nthe County Council home page, although more parochial consultations have appeared there in recent weeks, so unless people have time to investigate, they might well think that the consultation is about one of these parochial issues.  I know from speaking to\n people that a significant proportion are cancelling papers such as the Morpeth Herald and the Northumberland Gazette because they are looking for any ways to enable  their income to continue to cover their needs, so fewer people would be able to find out \nabout the \nconsultation from these sources.  \nWe therefore need an effective consultation so that people have had a proper chance to find out about it and respond.&#xa0;\nPlease tell us whySee answer 2, section A above\n. \n At the very least\n, there should be an effective trial period and means of opting out for the rural areas of Northumberland and County Durham if this arrangement is found not to be \nworking for them\n, because \nNorthumberland and County Durham would be the first 2 predominantly rural authorities to enter into \na combined authority, so there are no precedents for this particular situation – it would be a learning experie\nnce, particularly b\necause all of the other authorities are urban.  After all, 50% of the population of Northumberland is rural, and they have as much call to have their particular needs provided for as th\nose of the urban population are, but if representation is constituted a\ns it is proposed at present, the likelihood is that they would have no true and accurate representation at all.\n&#xa0;\nPlease tell us whyI do not agree that only \nthe c\nommissioning and procurement of subsidised bus services\n should\n \nbe devolved to Northumberland County Council. I think that \nall public transport services other than rail should be devolved to Northumberland and Durham County \nCouncils, because the other authorities will have absolutely no understanding of or interest in rural transport issues, and these are essential for the viability of the lives of rural inhabitants and their communities.\nI think that there should be some rin\ng fencing of the interests of tourism in those counties for the same reasons, and because tourism is the basis for such a large part of the economy of those counties.  It would be disastrous for them if other initiatives were to blight our chances of attra\ncting tourists.\nOtherwise, I agree with a more co-ordinated approach for skills and economy.\n&#xa0;\nResident\n(Business representative\nVolunt\nary and community rep\nresentative\nLocal authority/ partner organisation rep\nresentative\nOther interested party\n)\n&#xa0;\n"
