[normal]TRANSFORMING REHABILITATION: EVIDENCE SESSION[bold]In advance of the session on 4 December the Committee has been invited to 
[normal]an informal briefing session with senior officials from the Department about the 
[normal]reforms.
[normal]In thi
[normal]s briefing, I have asked 
[normal]officials to focus on the progress that has been made in the Transforming 
[normal]Rehabilitation Programme so far and the work that the Department has been doing with Probation Trusts to prepare them for the transition to the new system. Jeremy 
[normal]and I will then pick up any other questions you have during our evidence session.
[normal]I know that you have also asked for sight of the Programme's risk register in advance 
[normal]of our evidence session. The process of identifying and managing potential risks to 
[normal]the delivery of any programme is an ongoing process, as is establishing activities 
[normal]which mitigate those risks. Doing so is good practice and in the public interest, and it 
[normal]is my view that the public interest is ultimately best served by doing so in a protected 
[normal]environment. This allows for full and frank evaluation to take place and, for this 
[normal]reason, I am unable to provide you with the risk register at this stage. My officials will 
[normal]obviously be able to talk to you about the high level risks that they are managing and 
[normal]mitigating against, but they will not share detail on the risk register itself with the 
[normal]Committee.
