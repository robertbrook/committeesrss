defaultTRANSFORMING REHABILITATION: EVIDENCE SESSIONdefaultIn advance of the session on 4 December the Committee has been invited to 
defaultan informal briefing session with senior officials from the Department about the 
defaultreforms.
defaultIn thi
defaults briefing, I have asked 
defaultofficials to focus on the progress that has been made in the Transforming 
defaultRehabilitation Programme so far and the work that the Department has been doing with Probation Trusts to prepare them for the transition to the new system. Jeremy 
defaultand I will then pick up any other questions you have during our evidence session.
defaultI know that you have also asked for sight of the Programme's risk register in advance 
defaultof our evidence session. The process of identifying and managing potential risks to 
defaultthe delivery of any programme is an ongoing process, as is establishing activities 
defaultwhich mitigate those risks. Doing so is good practice and in the public interest, and it 
defaultis my view that the public interest is ultimately best served by doing so in a protected 
defaultenvironment. This allows for full and frank evaluation to take place and, for this 
defaultreason, I am unable to provide you with the risk register at this stage. My officials will 
defaultobviously be able to talk to you about the high level risks that they are managing and 
defaultmitigating against, but they will not share detail on the risk register itself with the 
defaultCommittee.
