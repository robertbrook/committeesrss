defaultWdefaultritten evidence from the Financial Ombudsman Servicedefault [PHS0032]defaultThank you very much for your letter dated September 2013 inviting written evidence to
default 
defaultyour Committee's inquiry into the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO).
defaultabout usdefaultI thought 
defaultit might be helpful for me to set out the nature and context of our work to begin
default 
defaultwith. Although our organisation shares the title of `ombudsman' with the PHSO, our
default 
defaultprivate sector remit in respect of financial services inevitably (and rightly) means that o
defaultur
default 
defaultfocus and operation is somewhat different.
defaultAs you know, the Financial Ombudsman Service was established under the Financial
default 
defaultServices and Markets Act to resolve disputes between financial businesses and their
default 
defaultcustomers. It brought together a number of pr
defaultedecessor ombudsman schemes under
default 
defaultone roof to create a `one stop shop' for financial services disputes. The service deals with
default 
defaultcomplaints involving banks, insurers, advisors and other businesses regulated by the
default 
defaultFinancial Conduct Authority (FCA), as well a
defaults those made against consumer credit
default 
defaultbusinesses currently licensed by the Office of Fair Trading. In total we cover more than
default 1
default00,000 businesses ranging from the major banks to sole traders.
defaultOur statutory remit is therefore somewhat different from the 
defaultPHSO's. Unlike the PHSO, 
defaultwe have a statutory obligation to both look at and resolve all complaints referred to us 
defaultdirectly by consumers, except in quite limited circumstances — giving rise to significant volumes of complaints (around 500,000 currently rece
defaultived per year). Our role also has to be understood in the context of a wider regulatory regime for financial services — including 
defaulta statutory regulator of industry conduct — the Financial Conduct Authority — from whom we are operationally independent but w
defaultith whom we work closely. So while we share our 
defaultinsight with both regulators and businesses, our focus is primarily on resolving individual 
defaultcomplaints, rather than necessarily looking at wider issues of commercial practice or 
defaultbehaviour in the market. Anoth
defaulter important difference is that, unlike the PHSO, if a 
defaultconsumer accepts our decision then it is binding on the business concerned and 
defaultenforceable in court subject to an upper limit on binding awards of £150,000 a case.
defaultThose sorts of distinctions (the
defaultre are of course many others) reflect the core
default 
defaultpolicy 
defaultpurpose behind our organisation — namely as part of a wider set of
default 
defaultregulatory
default 
defaultarchitecture, to correct market failure in financial services by
default 
defaultremoving the asymmetries of 
defaultpower between businesses and 
defaultconsumers
default 
defaultwhen engaged in disputes. So while there are 
defaulta number of analogies
default 
defaultbetween our services, we operate in a very different context from 
defaultthe PHSO
default 
default— whose purpose is so closely tied to the wider delivery of public services and
default 
defaultParliament's role in hol
defaultding the executive to account. Our evidence is therefore
default 
defaultinevitably 
defaultpresented though that lens.
defaultIn terms of the complaints that come to us, in 2012/13 we handled 2,161,439 initial
default 
defaultenquiries in 55 languages. 508,881 enquiries were taken on as new cases (an 
defaultincrease
default 
defaultof 92% on the year before) of which just under three quarters were about payment
default 
defaultprotection insurance. Almost two thirds of last year's complaints (62%) related to the four
default 
defaultmajor high street banking groups.
defaultyour questionsdefaultTurning to the specific questions you raised in your letter: 
defaultHarmonisation of Ombudsman schemes
default1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHow do you share good practice with other ombudsmen, to improve processes and
default 
defaultcustomer service?
defaultWe engage with our fellow UK ombudsman schemes in a regular, 
defaultstructured way through
default 
defaultthe well-established Ombudsman Association, of which Caroline Wayman (our Principal
default 
defaultOmbudsman and Legal Director) is an executive committee member. We also share best
default 
defaultpractice with other financial ombudsman schemes across the world, 
defaultthrough both informal
default 
defaultand formal networks. Ombudsman Association members regularly co-operate on issues
default 
defaultof shared interest, for example the recent work on managing the impact of Alternative
default 
defaultBusiness Structures (ABS) regulations.
defaultWe also enjoy warm and co-o
defaultperative bilateral relationships at senior staff and board level with a number of ombudsman schemes — including financial ombudsman schemes across the world.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhat are your views on the creation of a single access point for complaints to all
default 
defaultombudsmen?
defaultThere is certainly opportunity to improve access to ombudsman services across the UK.
default 
defaultAnd it is true that the fact that there are different schemes can cause consumers
default 
defaultconfusion.
defaultWe regularly research consumer behaviour, as whatever access mechanism we hav
defaulte 
defaultneeds to meet consumer needs. The findings we have, however, show that consumers 
defaultdon't search for `ombudsmen' — they look for specific resolution of their issue. So, if they 
defaulthave an issue with their bank, they are likely to contact us, or a debt charity,
default whereas if 
defaultthey have an issue with their NHS provider they are likely to contact advice agencies, 
defaultpatient groups or the PHSO. In our case regulatory rules require clear signposting of the 
defaultombudsman by financial businesses when they handle complaints.
defaultSo, while a single access point for all complaints to all ombudsmen might appear an
default 
defaultattractive option, we would be concerned that it would simply add a new cost (of running a
default 
defaultnew infrastructure) for a service which consumers would be unlikely to use, or se
defaulte benefit
default 
defaultfrom. A single portal for ombudsman schemes may also (however inadvertently) limit the
default 
defaultconsumer's understanding of non-ombudsman options available to them such as Citizen's
default 
defaultAdvice, trading standards or in some cases alternative mediation schemes.
default Of course,
default 
defaultone could add those services to the portal too, but that risks becoming unwieldy.
defaultThe existing ombudsman schemes are good at cross-referring consumers to one another
default 
defaulton the occasions when that is necessary. With over two million customer contac
defaultts last
default 
defaultyear, some of which end up being directed to other schemes, we have particularly strong
default 
defaultexperience of this. It's also worth noting that the EU online portal for ombudsman
default 
defaultservices — which is being implemented in parallel with the ADR directive — 
defaultwill offer a
default 
defaultsingle entry point for consumers who have bought goods or services online.
defaultWe cannot see the benefit of another 'single' portal.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhat are your views on whether or not there should be a single public services
default 
defaultombudsman in England, as there is i
defaultn Scotland and Wales?
defaultWhile we see the intellectual case for economies of scale and ease of access on the one
default 
defaulthand, and the benefits of specialisation on the other (see also question 6 below), in the
default 
defaultend this is a matter that is wholly outside our 
defaultjurisdiction and we have no particular view
default 
defaulton it.
defaultEuropean Directive on Alternative Dispute Resolution
default4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhat consideration have you given to the introduction of an EU Directive on ADR and 
defaultare you taking any action in response?
defaultWe are pleased to note that t
defaulthe Directive was based to a significant extent on UK best
default 
defaultpractice, and believe that its implementation in the UK should build on the strong existing
default 
defaultarrangements for ADR of which our service is part.
defaultThe ADR Directive is of course significant for us. We 
defaulthave been closely engaged with its
default 
defaultdevelopment, and we broadly welcome its provisions. We are looking at whether any
default 
defaultadjustments to our operations will be required as a result of the legislation which
default 
defaulttransposes it into UK law.
default5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo 
defaultwhat extent do you believ
defaulte the Directive will allow better and meaningful
default 
defaultcomparisons in performance and sharing of practice across providers or agencies?
defaultThe Directive has two functions: the first is to harmonise basic standards and the second
default 
defaultis to improve access. Given the very
default varied types of ADR provision both within the UK
default 
defaultand the EU we think the publication of data mandated by Directive itself is unlikely to aid 
defaultmeaningful comparisons between different providers.
defaultIt's also important to remember, as noted in the introduction 
defaultto our evidence, that variation
default 
defaultis not necessarily bad: different ombudsman schemes are — for good reasons — designed
default 
defaultin different ways, meaning that even where comparison may be possible it may not
default 
defaultalways be meaningful or instructive, either for the consu
defaultmer or other interested parties.
default 
defaultWe think the numbers can be useful — but they rarely tell the whole story.
default&#xa0;
defaultThat said, we do place a premium on transparency (we now publish ombudsman
default 
defaultdecisions, and have always been very open about the basis on which 
defaultwe make decisions,
default 
defaultand about the trends in complaints by issue and by firm) and we welcome any
default 
defaultencouragement to transparency in ADR provision. If not telling in themselves, published
default 
defaultdata can really help in bringing understanding to our work.
default6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo what exten
defaultt do you think the Directive presents an opportunity to remodel the existing system of ADR to resolve possible existing overlaps, shortfalls and conflicts?
defaultThe ADR Directive is certainly an opportunity to look at the system we have and decide
default 
defaultwhether it's 
defaultthe sort of system that parliament wants for the UK. And there is no doubt that
default 
defaultoverlaps and shortfalls exist. For example, if you're buying a house then your lawyer will
default 
defaultbe covered by one ombudsman, your mortgage provider another, and your estate agent
default 
defaultby
default yet another. There are gaps too — no ombudsman, for example, covers advice to
default 
defaultswitch occupational pension schemes.
defaultWe do have a good record of addressing these gaps and overlaps, in collaboration with
default 
defaultother ombudsman schemes where necessary. Overall, the 
defaultUK's ADR system functions
default 
defaultfairly well and the Directive won't necessarily force reform either.
defaultThat said, the Directive and the domestic legislation it spawns do represent a good
default 
defaultopportunity for the government to take stock of the ADR landscape, and to ask
default some
default 
defaultquestions about what approach we think is best for consumers and industry. There is a
default 
defaultcase for the current landscape, characterised by a large number of discrete and specialist
default 
defaultombudsman services to whom regulators and the industry can relate and dev
defaultelop close
default 
defaultrelationships, and most of whom operate in a way that looks a little like the courts. We
default 
defaultcan see the appeal of this network of smaller, specialised schemes.
defaultBut we can also see the logic of a landscape in which networks of fewer and larger
default 
defaultschemes operate. As well as being easier to navigate for consumers, they benefit from
default 
defaulteconomies of scale that give them increased versatility and resilience to peaks (and
default 
defaulttroughs) in demand — including those caused by mass complaints like PPI and changes i
defaultn
default 
defaultmarket or consumer behaviour, which can be hard to forecast. Bigger schemes can also 
defaultapply their learning and expertise across sectors and invest in outreach and insight, while 
defaultadjusting more easily to changes in scope and jurisdiction.
defaultOur own experienc
defaulte suggests that some of the best of both worlds may be possible. With 
defaultwork spanning two regulators, we have experience of managing work from more than one 
defaultjurisdiction, tailoring rules and approaches where necessary depending on the relevant 
defaultregulatory env
defaultironment, and more generally handling the technical and cultural 
defaultdifferences between sectors described elsewhere in this evidence. Other ombudsman 
defaultschemes have similar experience.
defaultFinally, in terms of the Directive, it's important to note that its provisio
defaultns on access are geared towards the relationships between consumers and traders. We don't have the 
defaultexperience to comment on far its approach might usefully translate to the slightly different 
defaultcontext of public sector ombudsmanry.
default7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHow can those involved in 
defaultdispute resolution, but who aren't covered by the Directive, 
defaultensure that they are meeting the same expected standards of quality as those who 
defaultare covered by it?
default&#xa0;
defaultAs stressed in my answer to question 5, it's important to note that different ombudsman 
defaultschemes do different things. Some resolve business-to-business disputes, while others 
defaulthandle consumer-to-business ones. Some deal with very complex cases requiring 
defaultspecialist knowledge and detailed research, while others handle relatively straightforward 
defaultm
defaultatters (and of course some — like us — do both). Some are obliged to handle all 
defaultcomplaints that come to them, while others are not. Some (like PHSO and us) have an 
defaultobligation to share their insights with regulators and others, while others don't. And every
default 
defaultscheme has different stakeholders with often very different requirements and 
defaultexpectations.
defaultTherefore, while high standards across the board are important for all of us, it isn't clear 
defaultthat one could or should impose precise definitions of what constitutes
default high standards for 
defaultapplication across the full range of schemes. Instead, it makes sense for the Directive to 
defaultimpose basic standards at a high level — which is exactly what it does. Then, more 
defaultdetailed standards should be determined by the relevant author
defaultity on a sector-by-sector 
defaultbasis, through the specification (and, where applicable, tendering) of individual 
defaultombudsman schemes. This specific standard-setting will be the real driver of standards, and will apply just as much to schemes outside the scope of 
defaultthe Directive as within it.
defaultIt's also important that flexibility should be shown within individual schemes as well as 
defaultbetween 
defaultthem: a simple case can and should be dealt with quickly, whoever is dealing 
defaultwith it, while more complex cases should get the time
default and attention they need. Ultimately this is in the consumer's interest: inflexible standards will always have to be set at a level 
defaultthat's reasonable for the slowest, most complex cases, which would be unacceptably 
defaultfrustrating for consumers and businesses 
defaultinvolved with simple complaints.
default8. 
defaultHow can the government ensure against the proliferation of excessive numbers of
defaultdifferent dispute resolution bodies and mechanisms (and should it be doing so)?
defaultIn my answer to question 6, I said we believe the overall approach taken by Government 
defaultto shaping the ADR landscape should depend on what factors it wishes to prioritise in the 
defaultprovision of ADR services for consumers. Relative proliferation might be desira
defaultble if we 
defaultthought consumers would benefit most from specialised services, with strong but narrow 
defaultindustry and regulator relationships. Alternatively, consolidation may be best if we thought 
defaultconsumers would benefit most from a marketplace that shared learni
defaultng, was more 
defaultresilient to mass complaints and could achieve economies of scale.
defaultIn any case, if Government does take the opportunity to re-shape the ADR landscape it must be careful to preserve the one overriding principle of all ombudsmen — i.e. their ind
defaultependence. As with any quasi-judicial body, an ombudsman relies on there being 
defaultconfidence (among both consumers and traders) that the scheme is genuinely impartial. 
defaultSo in contemplating any future changes to the ADR set up, it's essential that services are 
defaultnot subject to any funding structures that incentivise partisanship, or the perception of it. 
defaultAn ombudsman must not give the impression of having been captured by a financial 
defaultinterest to find in favour of one group or the other.
default&#xa0;
defaultTherefore, while a polluter-pays model which provides good value for money remains the 
defaultmost desirable approach, the use of competition as a means of achieving value for money 
defaultneeds to be considered carefully. For example, any competitive process whereby 
defaultom
defaultbudsmen compete to handle an individual business's complaints is likely to lead to a 
defaultrace to the bottom as far as consumers are concerned. Even if there is no change in the 
defaultsubstance of decisions, it's clear that a service's processes and approaches will b
defaulte 
defaultgeared to suit its customer (the business) rather than the consumer, which risks deterring 
defaultconsumers from complaining. It would also introduce incentives against an ombudsman making tough decisions which are unpopular with the industry concerned.
defaultI hope 
defaultthese answers are useful for your inquiry.
