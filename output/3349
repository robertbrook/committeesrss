[normal]W[bold]ritten evidence from the Financial Ombudsman Service[bold] [PHS0032][bold]Thank you very much for your letter dated September 2013 inviting written evidence to
[normal] 
[normal]your Committee's inquiry into the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO).
[normal]about us[bold]I thought 
[normal]it might be helpful for me to set out the nature and context of our work to begin
[normal] 
[normal]with. Although our organisation shares the title of `ombudsman' with the PHSO, our
[normal] 
[normal]private sector remit in respect of financial services inevitably (and rightly) means that o
[normal]ur
[normal] 
[normal]focus and operation is somewhat different.
[normal]As you know, the Financial Ombudsman Service was established under the Financial
[normal] 
[normal]Services and Markets Act to resolve disputes between financial businesses and their
[normal] 
[normal]customers. It brought together a number of pr
[normal]edecessor ombudsman schemes under
[normal] 
[normal]one roof to create a `one stop shop' for financial services disputes. The service deals with
[normal] 
[normal]complaints involving banks, insurers, advisors and other businesses regulated by the
[normal] 
[normal]Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), as well a
[normal]s those made against consumer credit
[normal] 
[normal]businesses currently licensed by the Office of Fair Trading. In total we cover more than
[normal] 1
[normal]00,000 businesses ranging from the major banks to sole traders.
[normal]Our statutory remit is therefore somewhat different from the 
[normal]PHSO's. Unlike the PHSO, 
[normal]we have a statutory obligation to both look at and resolve all complaints referred to us 
[normal]directly by consumers, except in quite limited circumstances — giving rise to significant volumes of complaints (around 500,000 currently rece
[normal]ived per year). Our role also has to be understood in the context of a wider regulatory regime for financial services — including 
[normal]a statutory regulator of industry conduct — the Financial Conduct Authority — from whom we are operationally independent but w
[normal]ith whom we work closely. So while we share our 
[normal]insight with both regulators and businesses, our focus is primarily on resolving individual 
[normal]complaints, rather than necessarily looking at wider issues of commercial practice or 
[normal]behaviour in the market. Anoth
[normal]er important difference is that, unlike the PHSO, if a 
[normal]consumer accepts our decision then it is binding on the business concerned and 
[normal]enforceable in court subject to an upper limit on binding awards of £150,000 a case.
[normal]Those sorts of distinctions (the
[normal]re are of course many others) reflect the core
[normal] 
[normal]policy 
[normal]purpose behind our organisation — namely as part of a wider set of
[normal] 
[normal]regulatory
[normal] 
[normal]architecture, to correct market failure in financial services by
[normal] 
[normal]removing the asymmetries of 
[normal]power between businesses and 
[normal]consumers
[normal] 
[normal]when engaged in disputes. So while there are 
[normal]a number of analogies
[normal] 
[normal]between our services, we operate in a very different context from 
[normal]the PHSO
[normal] 
[normal]— whose purpose is so closely tied to the wider delivery of public services and
[normal] 
[normal]Parliament's role in hol
[normal]ding the executive to account. Our evidence is therefore
[normal] 
[normal]inevitably 
[normal]presented though that lens.
[normal]In terms of the complaints that come to us, in 2012/13 we handled 2,161,439 initial
[normal] 
[normal]enquiries in 55 languages. 508,881 enquiries were taken on as new cases (an 
[normal]increase
[normal] 
[normal]of 92% on the year before) of which just under three quarters were about payment
[normal] 
[normal]protection insurance. Almost two thirds of last year's complaints (62%) related to the four
[normal] 
[normal]major high street banking groups.
[normal]your questions[bold]Turning to the specific questions you raised in your letter: 
[normal]Harmonisation of Ombudsman schemes
[normal]1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]How do you share good practice with other ombudsmen, to improve processes and
[normal] 
[normal]customer service?
[normal]We engage with our fellow UK ombudsman schemes in a regular, 
[normal]structured way through
[normal] 
[normal]the well-established Ombudsman Association, of which Caroline Wayman (our Principal
[normal] 
[normal]Ombudsman and Legal Director) is an executive committee member. We also share best
[normal] 
[normal]practice with other financial ombudsman schemes across the world, 
[normal]through both informal
[normal] 
[normal]and formal networks. Ombudsman Association members regularly co-operate on issues
[normal] 
[normal]of shared interest, for example the recent work on managing the impact of Alternative
[normal] 
[normal]Business Structures (ABS) regulations.
[normal]We also enjoy warm and co-o
[normal]perative bilateral relationships at senior staff and board level with a number of ombudsman schemes — including financial ombudsman schemes across the world.
[normal]2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]What are your views on the creation of a single access point for complaints to all
[normal] 
[normal]ombudsmen?
[normal]There is certainly opportunity to improve access to ombudsman services across the UK.
[normal] 
[normal]And it is true that the fact that there are different schemes can cause consumers
[normal] 
[normal]confusion.
[normal]We regularly research consumer behaviour, as whatever access mechanism we hav
[normal]e 
[normal]needs to meet consumer needs. The findings we have, however, show that consumers 
[normal]don't search for `ombudsmen' — they look for specific resolution of their issue. So, if they 
[normal]have an issue with their bank, they are likely to contact us, or a debt charity,
[normal] whereas if 
[normal]they have an issue with their NHS provider they are likely to contact advice agencies, 
[normal]patient groups or the PHSO. In our case regulatory rules require clear signposting of the 
[normal]ombudsman by financial businesses when they handle complaints.
[normal]So, while a single access point for all complaints to all ombudsmen might appear an
[normal] 
[normal]attractive option, we would be concerned that it would simply add a new cost (of running a
[normal] 
[normal]new infrastructure) for a service which consumers would be unlikely to use, or se
[normal]e benefit
[normal] 
[normal]from. A single portal for ombudsman schemes may also (however inadvertently) limit the
[normal] 
[normal]consumer's understanding of non-ombudsman options available to them such as Citizen's
[normal] 
[normal]Advice, trading standards or in some cases alternative mediation schemes.
[normal] Of course,
[normal] 
[normal]one could add those services to the portal too, but that risks becoming unwieldy.
[normal]The existing ombudsman schemes are good at cross-referring consumers to one another
[normal] 
[normal]on the occasions when that is necessary. With over two million customer contac
[normal]ts last
[normal] 
[normal]year, some of which end up being directed to other schemes, we have particularly strong
[normal] 
[normal]experience of this. It's also worth noting that the EU online portal for ombudsman
[normal] 
[normal]services — which is being implemented in parallel with the ADR directive — 
[normal]will offer a
[normal] 
[normal]single entry point for consumers who have bought goods or services online.
[normal]We cannot see the benefit of another 'single' portal.
[normal]3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]What are your views on whether or not there should be a single public services
[normal] 
[normal]ombudsman in England, as there is i
[normal]n Scotland and Wales?
[normal]While we see the intellectual case for economies of scale and ease of access on the one
[normal] 
[normal]hand, and the benefits of specialisation on the other (see also question 6 below), in the
[normal] 
[normal]end this is a matter that is wholly outside our 
[normal]jurisdiction and we have no particular view
[normal] 
[normal]on it.
[normal]European Directive on Alternative Dispute Resolution
[normal]4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]What consideration have you given to the introduction of an EU Directive on ADR and 
[normal]are you taking any action in response?
[normal]We are pleased to note that t
[normal]he Directive was based to a significant extent on UK best
[normal] 
[normal]practice, and believe that its implementation in the UK should build on the strong existing
[normal] 
[normal]arrangements for ADR of which our service is part.
[normal]The ADR Directive is of course significant for us. We 
[normal]have been closely engaged with its
[normal] 
[normal]development, and we broadly welcome its provisions. We are looking at whether any
[normal] 
[normal]adjustments to our operations will be required as a result of the legislation which
[normal] 
[normal]transposes it into UK law.
[normal]5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]To 
[normal]what extent do you believ
[normal]e the Directive will allow better and meaningful
[normal] 
[normal]comparisons in performance and sharing of practice across providers or agencies?
[normal]The Directive has two functions: the first is to harmonise basic standards and the second
[normal] 
[normal]is to improve access. Given the very
[normal] varied types of ADR provision both within the UK
[normal] 
[normal]and the EU we think the publication of data mandated by Directive itself is unlikely to aid 
[normal]meaningful comparisons between different providers.
[normal]It's also important to remember, as noted in the introduction 
[normal]to our evidence, that variation
[normal] 
[normal]is not necessarily bad: different ombudsman schemes are — for good reasons — designed
[normal] 
[normal]in different ways, meaning that even where comparison may be possible it may not
[normal] 
[normal]always be meaningful or instructive, either for the consu
[normal]mer or other interested parties.
[normal] 
[normal]We think the numbers can be useful — but they rarely tell the whole story.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]That said, we do place a premium on transparency (we now publish ombudsman
[normal] 
[normal]decisions, and have always been very open about the basis on which 
[normal]we make decisions,
[normal] 
[normal]and about the trends in complaints by issue and by firm) and we welcome any
[normal] 
[normal]encouragement to transparency in ADR provision. If not telling in themselves, published
[normal] 
[normal]data can really help in bringing understanding to our work.
[normal]6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]To what exten
[normal]t do you think the Directive presents an opportunity to remodel the existing system of ADR to resolve possible existing overlaps, shortfalls and conflicts?
[normal]The ADR Directive is certainly an opportunity to look at the system we have and decide
[normal] 
[normal]whether it's 
[normal]the sort of system that parliament wants for the UK. And there is no doubt that
[normal] 
[normal]overlaps and shortfalls exist. For example, if you're buying a house then your lawyer will
[normal] 
[normal]be covered by one ombudsman, your mortgage provider another, and your estate agent
[normal] 
[normal]by
[normal] yet another. There are gaps too — no ombudsman, for example, covers advice to
[normal] 
[normal]switch occupational pension schemes.
[normal]We do have a good record of addressing these gaps and overlaps, in collaboration with
[normal] 
[normal]other ombudsman schemes where necessary. Overall, the 
[normal]UK's ADR system functions
[normal] 
[normal]fairly well and the Directive won't necessarily force reform either.
[normal]That said, the Directive and the domestic legislation it spawns do represent a good
[normal] 
[normal]opportunity for the government to take stock of the ADR landscape, and to ask
[normal] some
[normal] 
[normal]questions about what approach we think is best for consumers and industry. There is a
[normal] 
[normal]case for the current landscape, characterised by a large number of discrete and specialist
[normal] 
[normal]ombudsman services to whom regulators and the industry can relate and dev
[normal]elop close
[normal] 
[normal]relationships, and most of whom operate in a way that looks a little like the courts. We
[normal] 
[normal]can see the appeal of this network of smaller, specialised schemes.
[normal]But we can also see the logic of a landscape in which networks of fewer and larger
[normal] 
[normal]schemes operate. As well as being easier to navigate for consumers, they benefit from
[normal] 
[normal]economies of scale that give them increased versatility and resilience to peaks (and
[normal] 
[normal]troughs) in demand — including those caused by mass complaints like PPI and changes i
[normal]n
[normal] 
[normal]market or consumer behaviour, which can be hard to forecast. Bigger schemes can also 
[normal]apply their learning and expertise across sectors and invest in outreach and insight, while 
[normal]adjusting more easily to changes in scope and jurisdiction.
[normal]Our own experienc
[normal]e suggests that some of the best of both worlds may be possible. With 
[normal]work spanning two regulators, we have experience of managing work from more than one 
[normal]jurisdiction, tailoring rules and approaches where necessary depending on the relevant 
[normal]regulatory env
[normal]ironment, and more generally handling the technical and cultural 
[normal]differences between sectors described elsewhere in this evidence. Other ombudsman 
[normal]schemes have similar experience.
[normal]Finally, in terms of the Directive, it's important to note that its provisio
[normal]ns on access are geared towards the relationships between consumers and traders. We don't have the 
[normal]experience to comment on far its approach might usefully translate to the slightly different 
[normal]context of public sector ombudsmanry.
[normal]7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]How can those involved in 
[normal]dispute resolution, but who aren't covered by the Directive, 
[normal]ensure that they are meeting the same expected standards of quality as those who 
[normal]are covered by it?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As stressed in my answer to question 5, it's important to note that different ombudsman 
[normal]schemes do different things. Some resolve business-to-business disputes, while others 
[normal]handle consumer-to-business ones. Some deal with very complex cases requiring 
[normal]specialist knowledge and detailed research, while others handle relatively straightforward 
[normal]m
[normal]atters (and of course some — like us — do both). Some are obliged to handle all 
[normal]complaints that come to them, while others are not. Some (like PHSO and us) have an 
[normal]obligation to share their insights with regulators and others, while others don't. And every
[normal] 
[normal]scheme has different stakeholders with often very different requirements and 
[normal]expectations.
[normal]Therefore, while high standards across the board are important for all of us, it isn't clear 
[normal]that one could or should impose precise definitions of what constitutes
[normal] high standards for 
[normal]application across the full range of schemes. Instead, it makes sense for the Directive to 
[normal]impose basic standards at a high level — which is exactly what it does. Then, more 
[normal]detailed standards should be determined by the relevant author
[normal]ity on a sector-by-sector 
[normal]basis, through the specification (and, where applicable, tendering) of individual 
[normal]ombudsman schemes. This specific standard-setting will be the real driver of standards, and will apply just as much to schemes outside the scope of 
[normal]the Directive as within it.
[normal]It's also important that flexibility should be shown within individual schemes as well as 
[normal]between 
[normal]them: a simple case can and should be dealt with quickly, whoever is dealing 
[normal]with it, while more complex cases should get the time
[normal] and attention they need. Ultimately this is in the consumer's interest: inflexible standards will always have to be set at a level 
[normal]that's reasonable for the slowest, most complex cases, which would be unacceptably 
[normal]frustrating for consumers and businesses 
[normal]involved with simple complaints.
[normal]8. 
[normal]How can the government ensure against the proliferation of excessive numbers of
[normal]different dispute resolution bodies and mechanisms (and should it be doing so)?
[normal]In my answer to question 6, I said we believe the overall approach taken by Government 
[normal]to shaping the ADR landscape should depend on what factors it wishes to prioritise in the 
[normal]provision of ADR services for consumers. Relative proliferation might be desira
[normal]ble if we 
[normal]thought consumers would benefit most from specialised services, with strong but narrow 
[normal]industry and regulator relationships. Alternatively, consolidation may be best if we thought 
[normal]consumers would benefit most from a marketplace that shared learni
[normal]ng, was more 
[normal]resilient to mass complaints and could achieve economies of scale.
[normal]In any case, if Government does take the opportunity to re-shape the ADR landscape it must be careful to preserve the one overriding principle of all ombudsmen — i.e. their ind
[normal]ependence. As with any quasi-judicial body, an ombudsman relies on there being 
[normal]confidence (among both consumers and traders) that the scheme is genuinely impartial. 
[normal]So in contemplating any future changes to the ADR set up, it's essential that services are 
[normal]not subject to any funding structures that incentivise partisanship, or the perception of it. 
[normal]An ombudsman must not give the impression of having been captured by a financial 
[normal]interest to find in favour of one group or the other.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Therefore, while a polluter-pays model which provides good value for money remains the 
[normal]most desirable approach, the use of competition as a means of achieving value for money 
[normal]needs to be considered carefully. For example, any competitive process whereby 
[normal]om
[normal]budsmen compete to handle an individual business's complaints is likely to lead to a 
[normal]race to the bottom as far as consumers are concerned. Even if there is no change in the 
[normal]substance of decisions, it's clear that a service's processes and approaches will b
[normal]e 
[normal]geared to suit its customer (the business) rather than the consumer, which risks deterring 
[normal]consumers from complaining. It would also introduce incentives against an ombudsman making tough decisions which are unpopular with the industry concerned.
[normal]I hope 
[normal]these answers are useful for your inquiry.
