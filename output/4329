defaultour staff 
defaultand from 
defaultP
defaultarliament
default has shown us that there is a real appetite for change. 
default 
defaultIn particular, our research tells us that an investigation - with its thorough explanation of what happened and the certainty of a final adj
defaultudication - is what people
default wan
defaultt. 
default&#xa0;
defaultLast year we listened to a wid
defaulte range of our 
defaultcustomers
default, including those who
default were frustrated and distressed by our decision not to investigate their complaint. They profoundly affected our thinking and informed our ambition to improve our service.  
defaultRes
defaultponding to 
defaulttheir f
defaulteedback
default we ha
defaultv
defaulte worked hard to increase the
default number of 
defaultcomplaints we take forward for investigation
default. 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis time last year we had completed 219
default&#xa0;
defaultinvestigations; 
defaultso far 
defaultthis year we have 
defaultalready 
defaultconcluded 869. This means th
defaultat four times as 
defaultmany people are
default now receiving a formal, final adjudication on their 
defaultcomplaint. We
default have achieved this by removing 
defaulta lengthy assessment process to determine whether or not to take a complaint on for investigation
default, and by redeploying some of the staff involve
defaultd in those assessments to carry out investigations.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultAn investigation provides both the complainant and service provider with a rigorous account of what happened. It formally engages the service provider (allowing them to respond to, and learn from, the c
defaultomplaint), and gives the complainant sight of the findings (and an opportunity to provide feedback on them) before they are finalised. 
defaultThe impact is that we are now providing more people with an independent, impar
defaulttial and formal decision
default on their complaint
default and achieving a definitive closure for all parties.
default&#xa0;
default We believe this is 
defaultwhat Parliament intended when it established the Ombudsman service as the final stage of the complaints process.
default&#xa0;
defaultGiven 
defaultthat we are now taking on a much greater number o
defaultf investigatio
defaultns, it is 
defaultunsurprising that the proportion of investigations where we up
defaulthold the complaint has reduced (from 86% in 2012/13 to 44% for the year so far).  This brings us more
default into line with other Ombudsmen, e.g. 
defaultthe uphold rate for the Local Government Ombu
defaultdsman
default in 2012/13 was 41
default%
default.   
defaultI
defaultn total 
defaultt
defaulthe number of complaints we uphold 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaulthas significantly increased: 
default 
defaultwe have upheld 
default343
default 
defaultso far 
defaultthis year, compared to 
default187
default in the 
defaultover the same time period last 
defaultyear.
default&#xa0;
defaultCustomer satisfaction has remained at the same levels: 98% 
defaultamongst those whose complaint
defaults
default w

default investigated and upheld 
defaultand 57%
default amongst those whose complaint
defaults

defaulted
default and not upheld.
default Both figures compare favourably with satisfaction ratings achiev
defaulted by 
defaultother Ombudsman 
defaultservices
default 
defaultwhose data is publicly available
default, such as the Financial Ombudsman Service
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn 2013/14 we expect to have the capacity to investigate and resolve 4,000 cases, with a view to resolving even more in the longer term.
default&#xa0;
defaultFurther 
defaultinformation about our performance so far this year is contained in the dashboard at the end of this memorandum.

defaultWorking with others and using what we learn to help them make public services betterdefault              default&#xa0;defaultWhen things go wrong people 
defaultoften 
defaulttell us they do not 
defaultwant the same thing to happen to someone else. Yet two thirds of people who make complaints say their complaint does not make a difference. We want to honour people’s ambition for their complaint to lead to service improvements. For us, h
defaultaving
default more impact 
defaultfor more people includes sharing the rich intellige
defaultnce and systemic learning from our casework 
defaultto drive improvement across public and health services.

defaultThe ‘multiplier effect’ of our work can most clearly be seen in 
defaultTime to Act. Severe sepsis: rapid diagnosis and treatment saves lives
default.  defaultPublished

default the need to improve awareness of sepsis - a potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when the body’s immune system overreacts to infection.

defaultA joint investigation
default, published in November 
defaultby ourselves and the Local Government Ombudsman
default,
default into 
defaultWarrington Metropolitan Boro
defaultugh Council and the then NHS Warrington
default, led to speech and language therapy being restored to young people in the area. 
default 
defaultThe issue was brought to light by the parents of one of the teenagers whose son had stopped receiving the specialist therapy he was 
defaultentitled to as part of his statement of special educational needs
default.  
defaultWe 
defaultuncovered a further 14 other teenagers similarly affected by the cuts.

defaultIn December we will be publishing a report 
defaultMidwifery supervision and regulation: recommendations for change.  
defaultThis is based on 
defaultour investigations 
defaultfollowing the deaths of three babies and a mother at Morecambe Bay NHS Hospital Trust.
default 
defaultCurrent midwifery supervision arrangements at the local level are at risk of not operating in the interests of the safety of mothers
default and babies. We argue this must change

defaultLeading the way to make the complaints system betterdefaultW
defaulte have started a significant programme of
default work to use our experience, 
defaultexpertise
default and insight
default to help make the complaints system better.  
default 
defaultF
defaultollowing the publication of the report of the 
defaultFrancis inquiry 
defaultour focus
default has been on the 
defaultnew 
defaulthealth landscape
default as
default this provides us with a real 
defaultopportunity to have a long term impact.
defaultBetween April and August 2013 we published three major pieces of research i
defaultnto NHS complaints - 
defaultThe NHS hospital complaints system – a case for urgent treatment?,
default 
defaultNHS Governance of Complaints Handling
default 
defaultand 
defaultDesigning Good Together: transforming hospital complaint handling
default.  Together these offered our perspective on what is wrong with the hospital complaints system, but more importantly what can be done to improve it.  We
default spoke of the 
default“toxic cocktail” of patients’ and carers’ reluctance to complain, coupled with a culture of defensiveness by NHS organisations. 
default  And we worked with 
defaultpatients, complainants, carers and NHS staff to address the issues behind the “toxic cocktail
default” head on.
defaultSince then we have seen the publication by Ann Clwyd MP and Professor Tricia Hart  of their review of the NHS hospital complaints system, 
defaultPutting Patients Back in the Picture
default 
default and the Government’s response to the 
defaultFrancis inquiry, 
defaultHard Truths
default.
default  Change in the NHS cannot happen from the centre.  
defaultWe welcome
default the Secretary of State ech
defaultoing our call for Boards to report quarterly on complaints.  
defaultIf Boards
default can learn more from complaints, then we would see real progress.  
defaultWe also welcome
default the 
defaultGovernment’s 
defaultrecognition of our ambition to increase signi
defaultficantly the number of cases we take
default on
default f
defaultor investigation
default, and our valuable role helping the health system to interrogate and learn lessons from complaints.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultLooking ahead, 
defaultt
defaultogether with Healthwatch England and the Department of Health, we are developing a patient-led vision and expectations for
default&#xa0;
defaultcomplaints handling in the NHS
default. 
default  W
defaulte will 
defaultalso actively support the
default Cabinet Office
default 
defaultreview
default of the use of complaints to im
defaultprove public services which was
default 
defaultannounced by Oliver Letwin MP at his appearance before the Committee
default in October
default.   We are pleased that 
defaultthis is now being seriously considered and that a programme of work, championed by the Minister, has been initiated to deliver it.
