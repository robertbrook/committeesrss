&#xa0;Written evidence from Compass Disability Services (PIC 0010)Compass Disability Services is a user led organisation based in Somerset but also operating in different parts of the country providing services which promote independent living.&#xa0;We carry out consultation work with disabled people and carers in Somerset through our Network project.  We work with local authorities to consult on issues that disabled people may be interested in having their say on.  We also carry out Disability Forums and Discussion Groups inviting speakers to engage with disabled people and carers and give them a chance to have their voice heard.&#xa0;We have been asked to carry out consultation work for Somerset County Council on topics such as the ‘Long Term Transport Strategy for Somerset’ in 2010 and the ‘Bus Subsidies Reduction Consultation’ in January 2012.  In addition to this, issues regarding transport have been raised by our members at our disability groups and forums.&#xa0;This information is summarised below;&#xa0;

[[[Public Transport]]]              Even in more urban areas such as Taunton, disabled people who               are wheelchair users have to wait sometimes close to 2 hours for a               public transport bus with a ramp which is suitable for them.  There               is only 1disabled space for a wheelchair on public transport and               there are inconsistencies in staff attitudes in assisting people to               access buses. Bus drivers can ask for other passengers to               collapse buggies to assist access but cannot insist, this relies on               members of the public being               helpful.              There are limitations of access with smaller buses in rural areas.

[[[Community Transport]]]

[[[              ]]]              The cost of community transport schemes has increased and is                  not necessarily cheaper than taxis. There are also problems in               getting transport, other services such as Slinky are not provided in               all areas of the County (report extract Jan 2009). If you have a               concessionary pass, depending on which service you use, you               can use your bus pass.  Slinky is limited to certain areas and it               doesn’t cross boundaries, they serve the local communities in the               areas they are based. “If one person wants it in the north and then               another wants it in the south it cannot be done”.  These services               are also in high demand and are often difficult to obtain.              No community transport is available in the evenings to provide               transport for disabled people to attend groups. This can be a vital               way of preventing isolation. 

[[[Taxis]]]              When disabled people have to use taxis to get to appointments               because of lack of availability of public transport they need to have               a known company to use as access can vary e.g. the ramps used               for powered chairs are not always to the same safety standards.&#xa0;August 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
