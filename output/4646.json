"&#xa0;\nAFS0066&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by the Department for Education&#xa0;&#xa0;Summary              &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nInternational evidence shows that greater autonomy drives up educational standards, and is most effective when coupled with accountability &#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Autonomy and accountability are the two key pillars of academies reform. &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;There is a distinct appetite for autonomy in England, evident in all types of school.&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAcademy growth is built on a track record of improving standards. &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Academies succeed because they have the space to innovate.&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Academies are driving improvement across the schools system through collaboration and partnership working.&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nLA inaction means we must act to tackle failure in maintained schools.&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe take the same approach when tackling failure in academies and our accountability framework enables us to take robust action.&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe have a robust system for assessing sponsors and free school proposers, but we also provide support to build capacity.&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe future system will further embed autonomy with clear accountability whilst ensuring greater input from sector leaders.&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n12\n&#xa0;\n OECD (2013) - \nPISA 2012 Results: What Makes Schools Successful?
