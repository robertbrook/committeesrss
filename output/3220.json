"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the National Kidney Federation1.0 Introduction1.1\n              \nMy name is Nicholas Palmer and I work for the National Kidney Federation (NKF), the leading patient charity in the United Kingdom, as Head of Advocacy\n.\n1.2\n              \nMy role is to support patients and carers individually through advocacy, and \ncollectively by working in partnership with NHS England, the Department of Health and other health related organisations, charities and industry.\n I have a team of Advocacy Officers who cover the UK.\n The NKF use the All Party Parliamentary Kidney Group to c\nommunicate at a political level.\n1.3\n              \nIn support of my role I am a lay member on NICE (National Institute for Health &amp; Care Excellence) Guideline Development Groups (GDG’s), currently serving on the Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) update, and Anaemia Managemen\nt in CKD\n;  and \nalso \nacting as a lay member \non the NHS England Clinical Reference Group (CRG) for Renal Transplantation.\n1.4\n              \nFurthermore, I am a member of the Strategic Clinical Network (Cardiovascular) in Thames Valley, South East Coast and London regions\n,\n where I represent the int\nerests of kidney patients, working with clinicians, patients and NHS England to improve the delivery and quality of renal services.\n1.5\n              \nIndividually I am a member of the Guys &amp; St Thomas Kidney Patient Association.\n1.6\n              \nAfter prese\nntation to the All Party Parliamentary Kidney Group on 21st October 2013 \nI have been a\nsked by the NKF Chief Executive \nand Chairman, to make written representation to the Select \nCommittee on the subject commonly referred to as ‘Bedroom Tax’ (otherwise known\n as ‘under occupancy rules’, ‘spare room subsidy’ or ‘housing benefit reduction’\n \n).\n2.0 Objective2.1\n              \nThe objective of this submission is to kindly ask that:\nRenal patients undertaking Home Therapy in receipt of Housing Benefit are exempted from the ‘Bedroom Tax’. More precisely, where those individuals undertaking either Haemodialysis or Peritoneal Dialysis at home and are currently in receipt of housing benefit, and are using a spare room for storage and/or treatment, which would normally attract a reduction in housing benefit, are exempted from a reduction in their housing benefit.3.0 Supporting Statement3.1\n              \nWhile some patients with CKD, on dialysis or with a transplant are able to lead normal lives, it is fair to acknowledge that r\nenal patients on bene\nfits are some of the most vulnerable people in \nour \nsociety\n today\n. It is not uncommon for them to have more than one long-term condition; the nature of \nCKD\n means that many have a severely compromised cardiovascular system, suffer chronic mobility issues often caused by CKD or Diabetes; \nsuffer depression; \nhave hypertension \nor\n hypotension, can generally be fatigued and suf\nfer from bouts of acute anaemia – many\n are therefore reliant on carers, family, friends and mobility devices to get around. Emotional support for these individuals importantly can also be lacking, and for those living alone the struggle to be \nheard\n and \nbattle a benefits system are a step too f\nar and they become drowned by a system that fails to see their need and recognise their dignity. I know this from the patients I and my Advocacy Team meet and talk to in response to their NKF Helpline calls.\n3.2\n              \nMany renal patients of a working age have lo\nst their jobs through ill-health or have found a route back into work blocked by a restrictive treatment regime; others have found education or training cut short.\n \n \nThere are three options for those patients\n who reach Established Renal F\nailure\n (ERF)\n: \n3.4\n              \nConservative Care\n is for \npatients, \nwho are generally too frail\n,\n and after detailed discussion\ns\n have decided that \nDialysis\n and\n a Transplant\n are not for them; Conservative Care \nevent\nually leads to \nPalliative C\nare and death. \n \nDialysis and Transplantation are more commonly referred to as Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) an\nd are the \nonly \ntwo treatment options \nwhich extend the lives of individuals with ERF.\n \n3.5\n              \nNotably for some \npatient’s\n \ndialysis is the\n only treatment option\n due to existing heart conditions or tissue type sensitivity.\n There are two type of dialysis; Peritoneal \nDialysis\n which\n \nis commonly undertaken at home\n/work four times a day lasting \nabout half an hour\n each time\n,\n and Haemodialysis under\ntaken within Hospital or ‘Satellite’ units requiring three visits per week with treatment sometimes lasting\n between 4 - 5 hours each time,\n together with travel it is not uncommon to be away from the home eight hours a day.\n3.6\n              \nAgainst this background t\nhere is a supported move \nin the kidney community\n (NKF Home Dialysis Manifesto)\n \nto enable more patients to undertake\n \nHome\n \nHaemodialysis\n (HHD)\n,\n collectively\n with Peritoneal Dialysis\n (PD)\n th\nis is\n referred to as\n Home Therap\ny, and\n provide\ns\n an essential option o\nf choice for dialysis patients\n allowing many benefits:\n3.7\n              \nThere is support from NHS England and through\n five \nDomains with their outcomes statement we can see that Domains one, two and four are directly related to \nHome Therapy\n:\n1 - Preventing people from dying prematurely\n2 - Enhancing quality of life for people with long-term conditions\n3 - Helping people to recover from periods of ill health or following injury\n4 - Ensuring that people have a positive experience o\nf care\n5 - Treating and caring for people in a safe environment; and protecting them from\n3.8\n              \nI\nn terms of the Bedroom Tax\n,\n it is the Home Therapies patients who are the prime focus\n of this submission\n. However,\n \nthe unfairness of such a tax\n must not be forgo\ntten against the\n financial burdens that many renal patients are under who face further assessments when applying for \nEmployment Support Allowance/Disability Living Allowance and now Personal Independence Payments. \n3.9\n              \nBenefits allow patients to ‘get by’ t\no enable a quality of life that many of us take for granted – the ‘Bedroom Tax’ is making that impossible for \nthose\n patients\n affected\n and forcing them to take decisions that will have a negative impact on their long-term health and outcomes such as decidin\ng against having Home Therapy \n(which has been reported widely to the NKF) \n–\n this is causing \nactual harm to a choice of modality that we try s\no hard to encourage and promote; the \npotential\n damage could be significant.\n3.10\n              \nThe\n NKF\n \nbelieve \nthat seeking an \nexemption \nfor Home Therapy patients is\n a fair ask in light of \nexisting \nexemptions \nfor foster families, \nfamilies with adult children awa\ny on duty with the armed forces and severely disabled children.\n We also feel that this is a very small request in light o\nf the numbers affected and t\nhe range of benefits that Home T\nherapy brings.\n3.11\n              \nLet us not forget this is a tax on vulnerable people carrying out life-saving treatment in their own home, which can extend their life expectancy and without such treatment wou\nld be dead within two weeks.\n We also believe that Home Therapy brings unquestionable savings for the ‘national purse’, a \nturn\n of phrase often used to defend the reasoning for the ‘Bedroom Tax’. \nThe next two sections will look at the benefits of the extra \nroom and \ncould be \nbroadly classed as \nHealth Economics.\n4.0 Need for room4.1\n              \nThe extra room \n(which for HHD are specially adapted) \nbrings \nbenefits\n for the individual patient\n including\n:\n5.0 Benefits5.1\n              \nThere are many \nbenefits \nthat Home Therapy brings including cost savings, improved clinical outcomes and social benefits \nall\n described below.\n5.1.1\n              \nReduced transport cost\ns\n \n–\n \nPatients have a total of six journeys to make each week for \nhospital-based\n or satellite haemodialysis. There \nare\n none for HHD and therefore savings can be made. \nFor example at Southend Hospital 2008/09 for 66 patients the total cost of transport to the Trust was £277,000; individually transport costs can be as much as £300 per \nj\nourney\n. Patient transport costs which are picked up by each Hospital Trust \ncan be\n erased.\n5.1.2\n              \nReduced clinical cost\ns\n \n–\n \nIt is widely \nacknowledged\n through research papers\n \nand by physicians within the kidney community \nthat the need for blood pressure medica\ntion\n,\n \nphosphate binders, and \nanaemia treatment\n \ncan cease\n with improved frequency of haemodialysis at home.\n Hospital in-patient stays are less likely as are infections with the upside being patients are healthier getting more dialysis.\n5.1.3\n              \nHospital/Satellite capacity increased\n - \nHome dialysis or home therapy frees-up capacity in satellite or \nhospital-\nbased dialysis units\n. \n5.1.4\n              \nCost saving per session of HHD\n –\nI\n \nt is comparably cheaper after initial outlay\n to have HHD\n, no nursing \nis time inv\nolved and it has been reported that there can be a saving of £25.00 per session.\n5.1.5\n              \nHealthier patients\nIncreased dialysis frequency\n \nallows:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1.6\n              \nSocial benefits\n&#xa0;\n5.2\n              \nLooking\n at all the costs and benefits as a society the best we can do for individual human beings is improve quality of life, reduce mortality and increase life expectancy – Home Therapy does this – the ‘Bedroom Tax’ prevents it.\n&#xa0;\n6.0 Challenges&#xa0;\n6.1\n              \nThere have \nalready been a number of challenges across the country to the ‘Bedroom Tax’ which highlights the dissatisfaction\n felt,\n but also the widely held view that this is a bad \npolicy\n affecting vulnerable individuals who\nse\n \nexisting \nhealth problems \nmean they\n already\n struggle financially.\n \nThe United Nations have voiced their concerns while Local Authorities have taken measures to help people.\n6.2\n              \nWestminster\n - \nA housing association tenant in central London won an appeal against the imposition of the bedroom tax by \nWes\ntminster city council - \nthe first such victory in England.\n \nThe \nblind\n man\n argued successfully to a tribunal that a room in his flat classified as a second bedroom had never been used as one and had always been where equipment helping him to lead a normal li\nfe was kept.\n6.3\n              \nGlasgow \n- \nA judge \nruled that housing benefit officials breached the human\n \nrights of a severely disabled woman after docking her benefits under the \n‘Bedroom T\nax\n’\n. The lady\n, who has M\nultiple \nS\nclerosis and her husband were legally entitled to\n a bedroom each because her condition was so severe she needed a specially adapted bed and bedroom.\n6.4\n              \nUnited Nations\n - \nThe Gove\nrnment's so-called ‘bedroom tax’\n \nhas been described as a \n\"shocking\" poli\ncy \"m\ny immediate recommendation is th\nat the bedroom tax\n is abolished”, said a UN Inspector invited to the UK by our \nGovernment\n. A\n final report will be presented in Geneva to the UN Human Rights Council in March 2014.\n6.5\n              \nLeeds Council\n - \nLeeds council has confirmed it will reclassify hundreds of rooms in council houses in a bid to help residents avoid the so-called \n‘Bedroom T\nax\". Across the city 837 houses will have their bedrooms reclassified as non-specific 'rooms', the council said. Thi\ns will allow residents to avoid their benefits being docked under what the government i\nnsists is a ‘spare room subsidy’\n not a tax.\n&#xa0;\n7.0 Discretionary Housing Payment (DHP)&#xa0;7.1\n              \nAs an organisation we know individuals can seek DHP to help bridge the shortfal\nl between their reduced housing benefit and cost of rent. However we are aware of a number of negative issues concerning DHP\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7.2\n              \nIn the DHP guidance produced by the Department for Work &amp; Pensions Local Authorities (LA’s) have the power to give indefinite awards for DHP. The interpretation and use of the policy by LA’s is lacking and as a result the NKF is aware of individuals \nwhose only option is dialysis (for optimal quality of life) being completely unfairly treated. Let us not forget dialysis is carried out in the home in order to secure the best possible care and that this reduces the cost to the \n‘\nnational purse\n’\n.\n This has \nbeen reported to us by Welfare Officers in England who support kidney patients.\n Simply put DHP is not working for our patient community.\n&#xa0;\n8.0 Support&#xa0;8.1\n              \nThe NKF has strong links with Renal Social Workers\n (RSW)\n through their chair Bernie Boruch based at\n the Manchester Royal Infirmary and she has forwarded a number of issues reported through the RSW Network\n \nwhich offer a supportive case and include\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n8.2\n              \nNHS England\n \nhas\n already made a supporting submission in favour of helping kidney patients \nto \nhave relief/exemption from the ‘Bedroom Tax’\n – this was made by the National Clinical Director for Renal Services, Dr Richard Fluck.\n&#xa0;\n8.3\n              \nFurthermore the \nBritish Kidney Patient Association\n (BKPA)\n has seen an overwhelming demand on their counselling service associated with benefits and ‘Bedroom Tax’ \nin particular while grants applications have increased. \n&#xa0;9.0 Conclusion&#xa0;\n9.1\n              \nNationally it has been reported that \n660,000 people \nhave been affected\n \nby the ‘Bedroom Tax’ \n- one third of social sector claimants\n. However i\nn terms of kidney patients we are looking \nsmall numbers, \n30 - 40 cases\n,\n \nt\nhere is potential harm to the very Home Therapy programme that we are trying to encourage\n though. W\nhile there is a wider crisis\n across many sections of society\n we plead leniency for o\nur patients wanting or having Home Therapy\n.\n&#xa0;9.2\n              \nWe ask that common sense prospers.\n9.3\n              \nThe policy\n is intended to encourage (singles or couples) people to move into smaller properties in order to free up accommodation for larger families. \n \nA freedom of inf\normation request published in the Independent in August highlighted the general problem of the tax and \nthat \n96 \n%\n \nof those affected had nowhere suitable to move to.\n9.4\n              \nIn Birmingham 13,557 households were affected but there were only 368 suitable \nproperties; while in Cornwall there were only 65 suitable properties for the 3,300 people eligible to be charged for under occupancy.\n9.5\n              \nThere has been insufficient, sustained building of affordable housing through successive governments over the last thi\nrty years\n which deeply flaws the policy to reduce housing benefit because of under occupancy.\n \n&#xa0;9.6\n              \nFinally, i\nt cannot be right that some of the country’s most vulnerable people who currently have or are seeking to have treatment that improves their \nquality of life and costs the country less are effectively penalised financially or prevented from having Home Therapy.\n&#xa0;\n9.7\n              \nThis is simply wrong\n.\n&#xa0;\n9.8\n              \nWe are talking about a very discrete group of patients with very specific needs, and I kindly ask that t\nhis committee recommend exemption for our specific group of patients from this damaging policy. \n&#xa0;\n9.9\n              \nMany patients who seek Home Therapy may never get the opportunity of freedom that a kidney transplant would bring; Home Therapy brings a freedom of sorts \nand in no way should it mean that patients face a financial levy for seeking it.\n&#xa0;\n9.10\n              \nTherefore we kindly ask that renal patients undertaking Home Therapy in receipt of housing benefit should be exempt from the ‘Bedroom Tax’.\n&#xa0;\n28 October 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
