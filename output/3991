defaulti
defaults the professional membership body for UK fundraising. Our mission is to support fundraisers, through leadership, representation, standards-sett
defaulting and education, and we champion and promote fundraising as a career choice.

default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Institute of Fundraising is the largest individual representative body in the voluntary sector, with over 5,500 individual members and more than 350 Organisational members.

defaultCharities in the UK raised £
default11.5 billion 
defaultfrom 
defaultindividuals through 
defaultdonations
default, 
defaultlegacies
default, and fundraising activities
default in 2010/11
default. This income is absolutely vital to charities, allowing them to deliver services and work to achieve their charitable
default objectives.
default&#xa0;
default2.1.2
default 
defaultThe scope and breadth of the charity sector is huge. There are 163,000 registered charities in England and Wales, and of these the majority (over 120,000) have an annual income of less than £100,000.
default This variation within the charitable secto
defaultr makes 
defaultmeaningful 
defaultcomparisons between organisations of different sizes and causes 
defaultimpossible
default and a ‘one size fits all’ approach to issues such as charity CEO pay should be avoided. 
default&#xa0;
default2.1.3
default 
defaultCharity CEO pay has generated press, political, and public interest since a series of articles beginning in August, starting with the Daily Telegraph article

defaultThe question of
default 
defaultwhat
default level of pay is ‘justified’
default is one
default which 
defaulteach and every charity trustee board 
defaulthas 
defaultto decide for themselves.
default Charity trustees h
defaultave a clear duty: 
defaultTrustees have and must accept ultimate responsibility for directing the affairs of a charity, and ensuring that it is solvent, well-run, and delivering the charitable outcomes for the benefit of the public for which it has been set up.
default&#xa0;
default2.1.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPublic perception of the remuneration levels of senior staff is something which all charities will have due re
defaultgard to. However, 
defaultthe most important factor for trustees in all the decisions they make has to remain 
defaultdelivering 
defaultthe maximum
default impact on 
defaulttheir 
defaultcharitable objectives. 
defaultIf the trustees’ experience leads them to decide that this can best be achieved through paying a higher salary to senior staff than all of the public would be happy with, then this is a decision which the trustees need to have the co
defaultnfidence, legitimacy, and discretion to make.
default&#xa0;
default2.1.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGovernment have committed to 
default‘Respect and uphold the independence of Civil Society Organisations to deliver their mission’
default.
default When commenting on the pay of senior executives in charities, all MPs should respect
default the right and ability of charity trustees to set pay levels that they deem appropriate, even if they do not agree with them personally. 
default&#xa0;
default2.1.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn setting remuneration policies that are appropriate for their organisation, trustees do need to have the best infor
defaultmation and guidance to hand. As such, the Institute of Fundraising welcomes the inquiry currently being convened by NCVO to establish the principles that should guide trustees as they set pay levels for senior executives.
default&#xa0;
default2.1.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultI
defaultt is hoped that the Inquiry prov
defaultides useful guida
defaultnce for trustees in setting pay, and gives reassurance to the Charity Commission and Government that charities have appropriate remuneration policies which are set according to best practice guidelines. 
default&#xa0;
default2.1.9
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, the introduction of new g
defaultuidance, while welcome, will 
defaulthave a limited effect on resolving
default 
defaulta wider issue. There is a gap of knowledge and understanding 
defaultby the public on how charities work
default, particularly the 
defaultlarger and more complex 
defaultcharities,
default 
defaultwhich needs to be addressed.
default  
default&#xa0;
default2.1.10
default&#xa0; 
defaultPart of th
defaulte solution is for the charity sector as a whole to b
defaultetter and more consistent
defaultly communicate
default 
defaultwith
default donors so that those giving money have a greater level of information on what their donation is being spent on and the impact that the charity is having in del
defaultivering its mission. 
defaultThe Institute of Fundraising has guidance on ‘Accountability and Transparency’
default which aims to help charities explain how they work and what they achieve. 
default&#xa0;
default2.1.11
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe also believe that future press stories or statements about senior pay within
default charities 
defaultshould be 
defaultmore contextualised. As the ACEVO Pay Survey Shows for 
default2013 m
defaultedian CEO salary of £60k is small compared to many other comparable public sector salaries.
default Furthermore, the figure of a salary on its own can never tell more than a small p
defaultart of the story. 
defaultInclusion of elements of the breadth of a charity’s work, the numbers of staff it employs, the complexity of its work (for example coordinating disaster aid relief to foreign countries) the 
defaultnumber 
defaultof people that benefit,
default and
default 
defaultits impact, w
defaultould 
defaultall provide useful context for the public and aid a greater understanding of the work of charities.
default&#xa0;
default2.1.12
default&#xa0; 
defaultThought should also be given to the potential consequences of negative ideas and connotations being established amongst the public when the media do n
defaultot provide this wider context. It is possible that some donors may have stopped giving money 
defaultsince seeing the stories in the summer. Of course it is the donor’s right to give or not give as they chose, but we should be mindful of how media stories are rece
defaultived and how donors may react to them; every pound that is lost through a donor cancelling a direct debit, or choosing not to give in the future, is money that will directly affect that charity’s ability to deliver services to their beneficiaries or work t

default achieving
default their charitable objectives.
