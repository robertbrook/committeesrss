"Written evidence from the Patients Association (LTC 69)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOverview&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Government’s commitment to improving the care of patients with \nlong-term\n conditions is to be welcomed. One key issue is that many patients find the pathways for chronic conditions confusing and muddled. This is particularly true for chronic pain. The Patients Association published a report, Public Attitudes to Pain, in 2010 which found that for the majority of chronic pain sufferers, there is no clear care pathway for chronic pain. This is despite evidence from the Chief Medical Officer’s report in 2008 that 7.8 million people in the UK suffer from chronic pain.\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe need clearer care pathway for all conditions which is discussed and agreed with patients at the outset of their treatment so that they understand what is happening to them and what to expect from their treatment. Any changes that might need to happen to the care pathway must also be discussed and agreed with patients.\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe lack of integrated provision and continuity of care between providers is a \nmajor\n obstacle in the provision of quality care for sufferers of \nlong-term\n conditions. \nWhen patients are being moved between care settings, we have heard that oftentimes their medical records and information about their ongoing care are not properly passed on.\n \nThere must be effective systems in place to ensure that when patients are moving between care settings, the information about their care follows them and that all professional involved in their care are fully prepared to treat their condition holistically.\n&#xa0;\n2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe already hear from patients who have difficulty accessing GP services, in particular there are issues with getting appointments. GP’s first and foremost duty and role must be to provide high quality medical care for their patients. With all these different roles pulling them in all directions, we are concerned that many GPs will not have the time to fulfil them all.\nCase Studies:&#xa0;\nA patient who contacted us was told that he could only discuss one item within a five minute appointment. He felt that this was restrictive and that the practice constantly puts pressure on patients to see the practice nurses. He feels it is a bit intrusive and feels it also puts receptionists under increased stress, because they are forced to tell the patients.\n&#xa0;\nOne patient told us that he had been trying to get a GP appointment for three and a half weeks and has been unable to manage it due to their obscure booking system and another caller problem with the GP appointment system as he commutes to work and cannot phone at 8:30, even when trying to reason with them they will not move and this is the only method which they use for appointments.\n&#xa0;\nAnother patient who suffers from a chronic condition told us that they operate a 10 minute limit on the time available for consultation. When / if they do see their regular GP then it takes the entire 10 minutes to update her on her condition and if she sees a locum it takes the ten minutes to update them on the medication she is on. She is very unhappy, especially considering she may wait weeks to see even see the GP and then does not get to talk about any ailments apart from the chronic condition she suffers from.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPatients calling the Patients Association Helpline frequently tell us that they want more time with their GP\n and that this is a particular problem for sufferers of long-term conditions\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhile GP consultations are relatively short, they have been increasing in duration in recent years. Between 1992 and 2007, the average time patients had with their GP rose from 8.4 minutes to 11.7 minutes. \n However, many patients report that they would like to have more time with their GP and that this would help them become more involved with their care. Evidence suggests that patient empowerment and outcomes for patients are affected by consultation time with longer consultation times resulting in better outcomes for patients.\n Indeed, patients are more likely to adhere to chosen treatments and have confidence in clinical decisions if they are able to spend more time with their healthcare professional.\n With the proposed move to GP Commissioning, there are concerns amongst doctors, patients and patient groups alike, that GPs may find they have to spend more time managing finances and have less time to care for patients. This may have a real detrimental effect to patients’ physical and mental wellbeing as well as poorer health outcomes. \n&#xa0;\n2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn addition to the beneficial impact that the length of time a consultation continues for can have on patient confidence and outcomes, it also important how that time is spent.\n GPs must use the time to ensure they have the opportunity to give the patient all the information they need to make effective decisions about their care and that the patient also has the time to discuss any questions they may have. By making greater efforts to address the concerns of patients by going through information with them to make sure they understand it and are not confused by it, evidence suggests that patients would be more likely to adhere to medical advice.\n&#xa0;\n2.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Patients Association fully support\ns\n plans to allow patients to choose their GP practice\n, but remains concerned that the Department’s resolve \nand commitment \nto implement\ning\n this policy has begun to wane. A\nllowing patients the freedom to choose their GP regardless of location offers real benefits to some patients who may wish to register with a practice closer to their work, near their child’s school or with a practice that falls within a CCG that offers services that would best suit their needs. We also recognise the importance of proposed changes to allow patients who move a short distance outside of a practice area to remain with the same doctor to allow a continuity of the doctor patient relationship. Indeed, 66.7% of patients rated choosing their GP practice as being one of the most important choices they could make about their care.\n \nThe current structure is arcane and does not reflect modern needs. Instead it continues to ignore the fact that it is increasingly commonplace for patients to live or work outside the area of their preferred GP practice&#xa0;\n&#xa0;3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHealthcare professionals must be \nsupported\n to have full and frank discussions about a patient’s care and be in \na \nposition to make clear the clinical re\nasons for their recommendation, including\n the potential effectiveness and drawbacks of \na recommended treatment – or \nany other treatment discussed\n or licensed for use by NICE\n. If the healthcare professional does not know enough about \na\n specific treatment, patients should be signposted to \na third sector organisation\n which specialis\ne\ns\n \nin that particular condition for further advice and information.\n We have also already commented on our belief that there needs to be a “cooling \noff” period before patients are required to make certain \ndecision\ns\n.\nCase Study:&#xa0;\nOne patient told us that they had been receiving the same drug from her GP for the past 8 years and has not been put on a different drug. She felt that this was because of money saving and would like to discuss it with her doctor who was not being communicative.\n&#xa0;3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGiving patients a greater say in their care and giving them more opportunities to choose for themselves what they want is certainly commendable and to be welcomed.\n However, for\n many\n,\n choice is illusory at best due to personal circumstances. If patients are particularly frail or from a less well of background, it is unreasonable to sugges\nt that they will be willing / able to travel\n \nfor tests or treatment - \nparticularly for those living in rural areas.\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEven for those who are able to travel, travelling \nsignificant distance\n for diagnostic tests is unlikely to appeal to many patients. Patients \nwant to be able to access good \nservices\n locally\n. For \nmost\n the choice \nis actually\n between two local hospitals rather than a local hospital and a centre of excellence miles away.\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBeing involved in decisions about their care is becoming increasingly more important to patients. In 2003, a Department of Health survey found that being involved in decisions wa\ns a high priority for patients.\n The Patients Association also published a report in 2011 which found that 84.6% of patients wanted to be more involved w\nith decisions about their care.\n Another survey by the Department of Health in 2007 \nfurther supported these findings\n. \n \nThis is important not only from a patient experience point of view, but also with a view towards clinical outcomes. There is evidence that patients who are more involved in decisions about their care are more likely to adhere to medical advice, \n and can result in better clinical outcomes.\n&#xa0;\n3.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn a recent straw poll of our members, the majority of patients did feel at least reasonably involved in decisions about their care (54.7%), however, 18.6% said they only felt a little involved and 8.6% said they were not involved at all.\n \nWhile many said they were reasonably involved in decisions about their care, the vast majority wanted to be more involved with 91.3% of respondents stating that.\n&#xa0;\n3.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is also noteworthy that when asked whether they more value being able to choose who will treat them or being involved in putting together their treatment plan, the majority of patients (69.8%) said they more valued being involved in decisions about their treatment plan.\n \nThe Patients Association welcomes plans to give patients with \nlong-term\n conditions greater opportunities to control their own care. Patient care is about two sets of expertise: the medical expertise of the doctor to propose treatments, diagnose and identify problems, and the patient’s own expertise in how they feel, what they need to make them feel better and the support they need to remain healthy. Combining these two viewpoints to come to a solution which is not only clinically appropriate, but also right for the patient are the core principles of shared decision making. It is also not unheard of for patients with \nlong-term\n conditions to have more significant knowledge about their condition than their doctor. It is also not uncommon for specialised third sector groups to be able to better support and offer advice for sufferers, although professionals remain apprehensive to refer or advise patients to seek help from these groups.\n \nGiving patients the chance to be equal partners in the design, and implementation of their own care will, we believe, be beneficial for many patients.&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe receive numerous calls to our Helpline regarding the issue of pain and we are amazed that at the beginning of the twenty first century we are still not meeting the pain management needs of many people in the UK. \n&#xa0;\n4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe medical and alternative therapies to relieving chronic pain are widely known and constantly developing. There is no reason for anyone to live needlessly with exhausting and debilitating pain. Chronic pain is one of the most common reasons people seek medical help and depending on the severity of their pain, sufferers are thought to use health services up to five times more often than the rest of the population. Chronic Pain is a particularly serious problem in later life and can cause tremendous suffering for patients. The effects of chronic pain can leave its sufferers depressed, withdrawn from social activities and isolated. These effects significantly impact quality of life and nowhere are they more appa\nrent than amongst older people.\nMay 2013\n NHS Information Centre, UK General Practitioner Workload Survey, (2007)\n Howie JGR, Heaney DJ, Maxwell M, Walker JJ, Freeman GK, Rai H.
