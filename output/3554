[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1
[normal]              
[normal]The changing context
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2007, when the Fourth AR was published, was the height of the IPCC’s prest
[normal]ige and the case for concern about anthropogenic climate warming (ACW).  The IPCC and Senator Al Gore were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Subsequently the credibility of the IPCC’s treatment of science has taken some serious blows:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]*
[normal]              
[normal]the “hockey stick” was the star of Assessment Report 3 (AR3) in 2001 and was included in AR4 in 2007.  The hockey stick claimed that the global temperature declined since about 1000 to the end of the nineteenth century,
[normal] when it has been increasing due to CO2
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]*
[normal]              
[normal]the report falsely claimed that “more likely than not human activities have contributed to an increase in tropical cyclone intensity” 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]*
[normal]              
[normal]Canadian journalist Donna Laframboise showed that contrary to IPCC claims 
[normal]the reports are not based exclusively on peer reviewed input from leading scientists were not true
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]              
[normal]the 
[normal]IPCC had to withdraw its claim that the glaciers in the 
[normal]Himalayas
[normal] were likely to melt by 2035
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]*
[normal]              
[normal]the 
[normal]Nongovernmental Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC) 
[normal]was set up to provide an alternative – and less politically alarmist slanted - story

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There has been increasing realization that the IPCC’s interpretative material – in 
[normal]particular the Summary for Policy Makers but also so
[normal]me of the base science – is not independent but there is a political agenda behind some – if not much – of it
[normal]:-  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“The 
[normal]climate summit in Cancun —- is not a climate conference, but one of the largest economic conferences since the Second World War
[normal]…One must say clearly 
[normal]that we redistribute de facto the world’s wealth by climate policy.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“We are an intergovernmental body and we do what the governme
[normal]nts of the world want us to do,” he said. “If the governments decide we should do things differently and come up with a vastly different set of products we would be at their beck and call.”
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]              
[normal]The IPCC’S Fifth Assessment Report
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There are a few improvements in the science in AR5 – the IPCC has dumped the hockey stick, and has dropped claims that hurricanes will increase in intensity and that flooding and drought will become more serious.  The main shortcoming is that the report is
[normal] unable to explain the 16 
[normal]or 17 year pause in global warming.   Next, despite the expenditure of hundreds of £M on climate models they do not track global temperature accurately. The (leaked) final draft Summary for Policy Makers identified that 
[normal]“Models do
[normal] not generally reproduce the observed reduction in surface warming trend over the last 10
[normal]–15 years”
[normal].  
[normal]This admission di
[normal]sappeared in the f
[normal]inal version
[normal], which massaged the inaccuracy of the models
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Richard Lindzen, Professor 
[normal]Emeritus, 
[normal]Program in Atmospheres
[normal], Oceans, and Climate, Massachusetts Institute of Technology
[normal], observed:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“I think that 
[normal]the latest IPCC report
[normal] has truly sunk to level of hilarious incoherence.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] They are proclaiming increased confidence in their models as the discrepancies between their models and observations increase…
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Their excuse for the absence of warming over the past 17 years is that the h
[normal]eat is hiding in the deep ocean.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] However, this is simply an admission that the models fail to simulate the exchanges of heat between the surface layers and the deeper oceans…
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If climate science were a “normal” science[bold] f[bold]ailure of the models to predict the[bold] temperature pause would lead many scientists to conclude that the assumptions underlying the models w[bold]ere [bold]wrong and we should go back to the drawing broad[bold].  [bold]But climate science is politicised with extensive commercial, reputational and grant funding vested[bold] interests hanging on it.  So the IPCC [bold]tries to massage the failure of the climate models and absurdly [bold]to [bold]claim [bold]an [bold]increased confidence in the models as the discrepancy between models and observations increase.  [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Don Easterbrook, Professor of Geology at W
[normal]estern Washington Uiversity
[normal], 
[normal]comments “the IPCC report must be considered the grossest misrepresentation of data ever published…After all these years, IPCC still doesn’t get it
[normal] - 
[normal]we’ve been thawing out from the Little Ice Age for several hundred years but 
[normal]still are not yet back to pre-Little Ice Age temperatures that prevailed for 90% of the past 10,000 years.
[normal]”  He states the IPCC makes a number of false claims including:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Easterbrook concludes “These are only a few examples of the highly biased, 
[normal]misrepresentations of material in the 2013 IPCC report.  As seen by the examples above, it isn’t science at all – it’s dogmatic, political, propaganda.”
[normal]1.3
[normal]              
[normal]The possible effect of the sun on the climate
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Th
[normal]e IPCC d
[normal]ismisses 
[normal]the effect of 
[normal]the sun on the clim
[normal]ate because it limits 
[normal]its analysis to solar irradiance
[normal], which only changes by 0.1% across the 11 year solar cycle
[normal].  But this is only part of the 
[normal]sun’s 
[normal]story. 
[normal]“
[normal]In the subdomain of irradiation, strong fluctuations do indeed occur, of up to 70%.  Ultraviolet 
[normal]light is converted to heat in the ozone layer and ionosphere and, as a result, leads to a formidable temperature rollercoaster with magnitudes of change reaching several degrees Celsius – all synchronized with the 11-year solar cycle…Furthermore, the sun’s
[normal] magnetic field also fluctuates in sync with the 11-year solar cycles, and all this has a profound impact of 10-20% on cosmic rays…These cosmic particles seed clouds in the lower atmosphere, which cool the earth.  
[normal]In other words, intense solar activity lea[bold]ds to less cloud cover, resulting in more warming, whereas weak solar activity leads to more cloud cover and so causes cooling[bold]…”[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]A recent NASA press release comments:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]There is, however, a dawning realization among researchers that even these 
[normal]apparently tiny variations can have a significant effect on terrestrial climate. A new report issued by the National Research Council (NRC), “The Effects of Solar Variability on Earth’s Climate,” lays out some of the surprisingly complex ways that solar ac
[normal]tivity can make itself felt on our planet.
[normal]”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A new paper by two Dutchmen at the Space Research Organisation of the Netherlands “found that that during the major part of the four centuries investigated, i.e. the period 1610 till
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] around
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 1900 – 1950 , the
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]average terrestrial ground temperatures depend solely on solar magnetic field variations.
[normal]”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Jasper Kirby, Head of fthe CLOUD Experiment at CERN, recently gave a thorough review showing strong  correlations between cosmic rays, solar cycles and earth’s clim
[normal]ate.  He projects a possible mini ice age by 2015 similar to the Dalton or Maunder minimum.

[normal]              
[normal]Response to the Committee’s questions
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]While the IPCC has addressed a few of the criticisms 
[normal]of its 
[normal]too often 
[normal]sloppy and “politicially” slanted approach in the past, it 
[normal]has not explained 
[normal]the reasons for the global temperature pause but attempted to fudge it, and it does not analyse why the climate models – on which £100Ms have been invested – are so inaccurate; th
[normal]ey are useless for forecasting temperature change.  The report includes a number of factual errors and does not 
[normal]adequately 
[normal]consider the 
[normal]possible 
[normal]effect of the sun
[normal] on the climate
[normal].  The IPCC 
[normal]has not addressed the main 
[normal]question 
[normal]about the extent of man’s 
[normal]effect on the climate
[normal], merely asserted a belief buttressed by phony statistical 
[normal]wording about 
[normal]the reliability of its view.
[normal]The truth is that far from being “settled” – which is a political or bureaucratic concept, not a scientific one – climate sciences ar
[normal]e immature and there are many areas that merit extensive research.  AR5 doubtless 
[normal]reflects the views of “state scientists” in 
[normal]Britain
[normal] (i.e. those directly on the government’s payroll including the Met Office, and those in universities seeking grants funded
[normal] by the government, who must be politically correct).  But it does not reflect the views of many 
[normal]competent and 
[normal]“free” 
[normal]thinking 
[normal]climate scientists in 
[normal]North America
[normal], ANZAC, and some continental countries.
[normal]  Because of the dominance of state scientists, we liv
[normal]e in a parochial little bubble of ignorant (so called) consensus.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]From the analyse
[normal]s 
[normal]in 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 
[normal]I draw the main conclusion that AR5 is a most unsatisfactory report
[normal] and should not be the basis for any policies in any country.
[normal]  
[normal]The Committee asks “
[normal]W
[normal]hat relevance do the IPCC’s conclusions have in respect of the review of the fourth Carbon Budget?
[normal] - it
[normal] should have none.  
[normal]THE VERY COSTLY GREEN/DECARBONISING AGENDA IS[bold] NOT [bold]EFFECTIVE IN ACHIEVING ITS BASIC OBJECTIVES OF REDUCING CO2 EMISSIONS[bold]:-[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]NOR WILL OUR EFFORT DO MUCH IF ANYTHING TO SAVE THE PLANET.  [bold]Britain
[normal] emits 
[normal]about 1.2% of the world’s greenhouse gases. 
[normal]Although we may virtually eliminate the 30
[normal] [bold]Mtoe of coal we used in power plants in 2012, between 2001-09 the use of coal in China and India increased by 967Mtoe and is forecast to increase by a further 3300TWh 
[normal]p.a. by 2035, which is about 30 times the current output of Britain’s coal plants (109TWh in 2011). A
[normal]s Peter Lilley MP pointed out in a recent speech in Westminster Hall, the increase in 
[normal]China
[normal]’s CO2 emissions in 2011 was 200Mt more than the total emitted b
[normal]y the 
[normal]UK
[normal]. In 
[normal]a presentation on 
[normal]14 October 2013
[normal] to the World Energy Congress Wood Mackenzie forecast that global coal consumption is expected to rise by 25% by the end of the decade slightly overtaking oil. 
[normal]And while we obsess about driving 
[normal]coal plant, 
[normal]Germ
[normal]any
[normal] and the 
[normal]Netherlands
[normal] are just completing 
[normal]ten 900MW 
[normal]high efficiency coal plants.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The carbon budgeting process and the Climate Change Committee should be scrapped as a[bold] pointless [bold]waste of money.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]BOTH THE IPCC AND THE CCC HAVE FAILED TO PROVIDE A SOUND [bold]ASSESSMENT OF THE STATE OF CLIMAT SCIENCE.  WE NEED A TRULY INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT UNDERTAKEN BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO VESTED COMMERCIAL OR REPUTATIONAL INTEREST IN THE OUTCOME.[bold]&#xa0;

[normal]THE CHANGING CONTEXT
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2007, when the Fourth AR was published, was the height of the IPCC’s prestige and 
[normal]public belief in 
[normal]the case for concern about anthropogenic climate warming (ACW).  The IPCC and Senator Al Gore
[normal] were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and a survey showed that 90
[normal]% of people were concerned about ACW.  In 
[normal]Britain
[normal] the concern was manifest in the Climate Change Bill.  Subsequently the 
[normal]credibility 
[normal]of the IPCC
[normal]’s treatment of science has taken some 
[normal]serious blows
[normal] which are described in the following section
[normal].  The IPCC has
[normal] promoted some obviously flawed science; the models it uses failed to track temperature, notably the pause in temperature rise; climategate; challenges from internet blogs; 
[normal]and an 
[normal]increasing realization that the IPCC is a political body.

[normal]In a blog titled “Systematic misrepresentation of the

[normal]a p

[normal]recent natural disasters 
[normal]was a
[normal] non-peer reviewed paper by Munich Re Insurance. He wrote a book “The Climate Fix” which sets out the story
[normal] of

[normal]T
[normal]he editing of Chapter 8, Detection of Climate Change and Attribution of Causes, in

[normal]Africa
[normal] will be the big winner, and huge amounts of money will flow there.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]“One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is 
[normal]environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with environmental policy anymore.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] “
[normal]I am not going to rest easy until I have articulated in every possible form the need to bring
[normal] about major structural changes in economic growth and development. That’s the real issue. Climate change is just a part of it.”

[normal]“We are an intergovernmental body and we do what the governments of the world want us to do,” he said. “If the governments decide we should do things differently
[normal] and come up with a vastly different set of products we would be at their beck and call.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Pachauri is here letting the cat out of the bag.  The first word of IPCC is intergovernmental, and governments are political bodies
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]THE IPCC’S FIFTH ASSESSMENT 
[normal]REPORT
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There are a few improvements in the science
[normal] in AR5
[normal] – the IPCC has dumped the hockey stick and reinsta
[normal]ted the Medieval Warming Period, and 
[normal]has dropped claims that hurricanes will increase in intensity and 
[normal]that 
[normal]flooding and drought will become more serious
[normal].  
[normal]But it is strangely quiet about the feedback of climate sensitivity, which has inflated the estimate
[normal]s of future supposed warming by CO2
[normal], and 
[normal]it is slightly
[normal] more modest in its estimates of future warming.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The main shortcomings are that the report is unable to explain the 16
[normal] or 
[normal]17 year
[normal] pause in global warming, a shortcoming which is linked to the secon
[normal]d shortcoming.  Namely despite the expenditure of hundreds of £
[normal]M
[normal] on climate models
[normal] they do not track global temperature accurately.  Furthermore there are factual errors in the report, and it does not take account of the increasing evidence for the influen
[normal]ce of the sun
[normal] on the climate

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This difference between simulated and observed trends could be caused by some combination of (a) internal climate variability, (b) missing or incorrect
[normal] radiative
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]forcing, and (c) model response error.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The relevant text is in Box 9.2 of the full report and runs to
[normal] five
[normal] pages of incomprehensible jargon and gibble gabble
[normal] which does not explain the pause
[normal].
[normal]Another storyline is that 16 or 17 years is not long
[normal] enough to reliably assess trends in climate change, and so we must wait some more.  But this principle was not applied 
[normal]by the “warmists” 
[normal]during the 1980s and 1990s when a decade of warming was enough to set the alarm bells ringing on 
[normal]ACW due to 
[normal]CO2 and a 
[normal]few more years

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Paul Homewood
[normal] shows 
[normal]how the IPCC graphs misrepresened 
[normal]the longer term temerature trend
[normal]:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]Their base period of 1951-2013, against which they have measured post 1998 trends, includes:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.
[normal]              
[normal]28 years of cooling 
[normal]– 1951-79
[normal]2.
[normal]              
[normal]22 years of warming – 1979-2001
[normal]3.
[normal]              
[normal]12 years of cooling again – 2001-2013
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]So, in total, during 40 out of the 62 years there has been a cooling trend. They are comparing a statistically insignificant amount of warming since 1998, with three 
[normal]decades of cooling. The result is to make this small trend sound much more significant than it is.
[normal]It would surely have been more honest to have compared the post 1998 trend with the 1979-98 period. If they had have done this, of course, most people would r
[normal]ealised that the much trumpeted global warming really had stopped for the time being. And, in the IPCC’s eyes, that was not the message they wanted people to hear.”

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] They are proclaiming increased confidence in their models as the discrepancies between their models and observations increase…
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Their excuse for the absence of warming over the past 17 years is that the h
[normal]eat is hiding in the deep ocean.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] However, this is simply an admission that the models fail to simulate the exchanges of heat between the surface layers and the deeper oceans…
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Finally, in attributing warming to man, they fail to point out that the warming
[normal] has been small, and totally consistent with there being nothing to be alarmed about.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] It is 
[normal]quite amazing to see the contortions the IPCC has to go through in order to keep the international climate agenda going.”

[normal]Massaging the models
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]final draf
[normal]t SPM 
[normal](which was leaked) 
[normal]identified 
[normal]that 
[normal]“Models do not generally reproduce the observed reduction in surface warming trend over the last 10
[normal]–15 years”
[normal].  
[normal]This admission di
[normal]sappeared in the f
[normal]inal version. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]McIntyre
[normal] 
[normal]points out that a draft of the report 
[normal]“clearly showed the discrepancy between models and observations, though IPCC’s covering text reported otherwise…Needless to say, this diagram did not survive.  Instead, IPCC replaced the damning (but accurate) diagram with a new diagram in which the incons
[normal]istency has been disappeared…N
[normal]ow here is the replacement graphic in the Approved Draft: this time, observed values are no longer outside the projection envelopes from the earlier reports. IPCC described it as follows:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]Even though the projections from 
[normal]the models were never intended to be predictions over such a short time scale, the observations through 2012 generally fall within the projections made in all past assessments
[normal].”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]McIntyre explains how the IPCC massaged the exhibit to arrive at this result,
[normal] and  comments “
[normal]None of this portion of the IPCC assessment is drawn from peer-reviewed material.  Nor is it consistent with the documents sent to external reviewers.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]One implication [bold]of the failure of the models [bold]– which are structured based on CO2 drivin[bold]g climate [bold]change [bold]and excluding the possible effects of the sun[bold] - [bold]is that it is not possible to differentiate between natural climate variability and anthropogenic climate warming.  Notwithstanding this failure[bold],[bold] the report and SPM frequently [bold]and [bold]without justification assert of [bold]various [bold]phenomen[bold]a[bold] that they are due to “greenhouse gas and other anthropogenic forcing”.  [bold]A second implication is that the models are of no use for projecting or forecasting global temperatures, let alone regional temperatur[bold]es[bold].[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3

[normal]Factual errors and misrepresentation
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Don Easterbrook, Professor of Geology at Western Washington Uiversity
[normal], 
[normal]comments
[normal] “the IPCC report must be considered the grossest misrepresentation of data ever published…After all these years, IPCC still doe
[normal]sn’t get it—we’ve been thawing out from the Little Ice Age for 
[normal]several hundred years but still are not yet back to pre-Little Ice Age temperatures that prevailed for 90% of the past 10,000 years.
[normal]”
[normal]  He points out a number of errors
[normal]:-
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Easterbrook co
[normal]n
[normal]cludes “Th
[normal]ese are only a few examples of the highly biased, misrepresentations of material in the 2013 IPCC report.  As seen by the examples above, it isn’t science at all – it’s dogmatic, political, propaganda.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The NIPCC “Scientific Critique of IPCC’s 2013 Summar
[normal]y for Policy Makers”
[normal] identifies a number of “Misleading or Untrue Statements” including:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Bob Tisdale pointed out that in Figure SPM.10 the IPCC showed the temperature increasing 
[normal]by 
[normal]0.25
[normal]0
[normal]C
[normal] when there was no such increase

[normal]The possible effect of the sun o
[normal]n
[normal] the climate
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Th
[normal]e IPCC d
[normal]ismisses 
[normal]the effect of 
[normal]the sun on the climate because it limits 
[normal]its analysis to solar irradiance
[normal], which only changes by 0.1% across the 11 year solar cycle
[normal].  But this is only part of the 
[normal]su
[normal]n
[normal]’s 
[normal]story.  
[normal]In “The Neglected Sun”, recently published by Professor Fritz Vahrenholt
[normal] and 
[normal]Sebastian Lüning
[normal], the authors point out 
[normal]“ the IPCC “
[normal]overlooks a crucial detail.  In the subdomain of irradiation, strong fluctuations do indeed occur, of up to 70%.  Ultraviolet light is converted to heat in the ozone layer and ionosphere and, as a result
[normal], leads to a formidable temperature rollercoaster with magnitudes of change reaching several degrees Celsius – all synchronized with the 11-year solar cycle…Furthermore, the sun’s magnetic field also fluctuates in sync with the 11-year solar cycles, and al
[normal]l this has a profound impact of 10-20% on cosmic rays…These cosmic particles seed clouds in the lower atmosphere, which cool the earth.  
[normal]In other words, intense solar activity leads to less cloud cover, resulting in more warming, whereas weak solar activit[bold]y leads to more cloud cover and so causes cooling[bold] (emboldening added)[bold]…[bold]And just a few per cent variation in cloud cover results in a change in the earth’s irradiative energy budget equal to the projected amount of the warming the IPCC claims that anthropoge
[normal]nic CO2 causes.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Fluctuations in solar activity are manifested over a wide range of cycles and have characteristic cycle lengths of between 11 and 2,300 years. 
[normal]Especially important in today’s context is the 1000 year cycle, which led to unusually high ir[bold]radiation intensities during the second half of the twentieth century. Over recent decades, the sun has been in one of its most active phases of the last 10,000 years.  Solar magnetic field activity more than doubled between 1901 and 1995.  Similar irradia[bold]tion maximums occurred 1,000 years ago (the Medieval warm period) and 2000 years ago (the Roman warm period).  In both periods, pronounced climate warming took place.  The Roman warm period, the Medieval warm period and today’s Modern Optimum (since 1850) [bold]are well documented.  Between those warm periods the sun’s activity decreased and this led to distinct cold phases – the Vandal Cold Period and the Little Ice Age[bold]…”[bold](emboldening added)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]“We are by no means claiming that CO2 has had no impact on today’s 
[normal]climate events.  However, we are able to show that at least half of the warming of the last 30 years can be attributed to the sun and oceanic oscillations.  CO2 could be responsible for the other half of the warming, but its share may be even less than tha
[normal]t…Taking both the important natural and anthropogenic climate factors into account, we can expect a slight cooling of about 0.2-
[normal]0.3
[normal]0
[normal]C
[normal] by the year 2035.  Only cooling can be expected from the sun over the coming decades.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A recent NASA press release commen
[normal]ts:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]There is, however, a dawning realization among researchers that even these apparently tiny variations can have a significant effect on terrestrial climate. A new report issued by the National Research Council (NRC), “The Effects of Solar Variability
[normal] on Earth’s Climate,” lays out some of the surprisingly complex ways that solar activity can make itself felt on our planet.
[normal]”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A new paper by two Dutchmen at the Space Research Organisation of the Netherlands “found that 
[normal]that during the major part of the f
[normal]our centuries investigated, i.e. the period 1610 till
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] around
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 1900 – 1950 , the
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] average terrestrial ground temperatures depend solely on solar magnetic field variations. After 1900 there is an increasing excess in the temperature which is ascribed to ant
[normal]hropogenic
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] activity.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] After the impressive Grand Maximum of the 20th century the sun went through an exceptional
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] not before observed phase transition that lasted relatively long, i.e. from about 2005 till 
[normal]2010.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Jasper Kirby, Head of fthe CLOUD 
[normal]Experiment at CERN
[normal], recently
[normal] gave a thorough review showing strong  correlations between cosmic rays, solar cycles and earth’s climate
[normal].  He projects a possible mini ice age by 2015 similar to the Dalton or Maunder minimum

[normal]THE COMMITTEE ON CLIMATE CHA
[normal]NGE (CCC)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Committee has just published what is in its Chapter 1 “Update of climate science” an uncritical endorsement of AR5
[normal].  It begins by stating:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Uncritical acceptance 
[normal]of the IPCC story
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Even the IPCC did not run this spin
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The IPCC backed off making an estimate of climate sensitivity, see footnote 17
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It 
[normal]recasts a number of well worn 
[normal]canards
[normal] including:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]See 3.3. for the facts on continuing sea level rise for which there is no evidence of an acceleration rise, 
[normal]and “
[normal]Nor is there any basis for blaming it on CO
[normal]2
[normal] because sea level has been rising for 150 years, long before CO
[normal]2
[normal] levels began to rise after 
[normal]1945”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This claim is just 
[normal]not 
[normal]true; the ice in 
[normal]Antarctica
[normal] is incre
[normal]asing 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Global surface temperatures are the highest since temperature records began 150 years ago, but were at least as high in the Medieval and Roman Warming Periods when the level of CO2 was less.  While similar 
[normal]fluctuations have been seen and are to be expected, that is no indication of long term warming
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The magnitude of feedback is an open question.  Einstein once observed that his theories could be disproved by o
[normal]ne experiment whose results did not concur with theory
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Committee clearly 
[normal]believes in models, and makes no comment on their failure
[normal].  As Julius Caesar long ago observed “Fere liben
[normal]ter homines quo
[normal]d volunt credunt”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal].
[normal]              
[normal]THE COMMITTEE’S QUESTIONS
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Committee invites responses
[normal] 
[normal]to 
[normal]the following questions:
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.
[normal]              
[normal]How robust are the conclusions in the AR5 Physical Science Basis report? Have the IPCC adequately addresses criticisms of previous reports? How much scope is there to question of the report’s conclusions? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]headline 
[normal]conclusion
[normal]s
[normal] are flimsy; the IPCC has addressed some of the criticisms but not the main ones 
[normal]about the extent of man’s effect on the climate.
[normal]  There is extensive scope to question the
[normal] AR5’s 
[normal]conclusion
[normal] 
[normal]about a very basic 
[normal]issue
[normal], namely 
[normal]“Statistical Analyses of Surface T
[normal]emperatures in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report” by Douglas Keenan
[normal] 
[normal]explained the complexities, uncertainties, in developing trends from time series data, in particualr the pitfalls in choosing
[normal] statistical 
[normal] models. He then shows the simplistic manner 
[normal]in wh
[normal]ich the IPCC 
[normal]adopted a model
[normal]; and 
[normal]argu
[normal]es
[normal] that (S 10.2.2) “[the IPCC] effectively acknowledges that we do not understand the data well enough to choose a statistical 
[normal]model.”  He concludes “
[normal]Simply put, no one has yet presented valid statistical analysis of a
[normal]ny observational data to show global warming is real. Moreover, that applies to any warming - whether attributable to humans or to nature.  This is implied by S 10.2.2 and indeed is clear from statistics”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]              
[normal]To what extent does AR5 reflect the range of 
[normal]views among climate scientists?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]It reflects the views of “state scientists” in Britain (i.e. those directly 
[normal]o
[normal]n the government’s payroll inclu
[normal]ding the Met Office
[normal], and those in universities seeking gra
[normal]nts 
[normal]funded by the government
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]who must be
[normal] politically c
[normal]orrect).  But it does not reflect the views of many “free” 
[normal]climate scientists 
[normal]in 
[normal]North America
[normal], ANZAC, and some continental countries
[normal].  
[normal]The fact that virtually all, if not all, [bold]working [bold]climate scientists in Britain are[bold] directly or indirectly [bold]state scientis[bold]ts is probably the reason why there are (to my knowledge) no s[bold]c[bold]eptic scientists in Britain[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]              
[normal]Can any of the areas of the science now be considered settled as a result of AR5’s publication, if so which?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] What areas need further effort to reduce the levels
[normal] of uncertainty?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]Few, if any, areas can be regarded as settled.  
[normal]There are ma
[normal]ny a
[normal]reas 
[normal]that need research, perhaps starting with a better understanding of the 
[normal]effect of the sun on the climate and all that entails
[normal]; the functioning of clouds and water vapou
[normal]r; the sensitivity of temperature to CO2, which is fundamental to forward temperature estimates if CO2 is
[normal] taken as a driver of temperature
[normal]; and the dynamics of oceans.  In a seminar last year in the House of Commons Professor Lindzen commented 
[normal]that 
[normal]“climat
[normal]e science is an immature science”, i.e. there is a lot to learn.  He went on to add “It cannot even forecast the past, let alone the future”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.
[normal]              
[normal]How effective is AR5 and the summary for policymakers in conveying
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] what is meant by uncertainty in scientific
[normal] terms ? Would a focus on risk rather than uncertainty be useful?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]The a
[normal]pp
[normal]roach of claim
[normal]ing 
[normal]90% 
[normal]in AR4
[normal] and 
[normal]in AR5
[normal] 
[normal]95% probabili
[normal]ties 
[normal]of confidence in belief of this and that 
[normal]is bizarre, increasing 
[normal]the IPCC’s confidence 
[normal]as 
[normal]t
[normal]he divergence
[normal] between models and re
[normal]ality increased. The probablity figures have 
[normal]nothing to do with scien
[normal]tific o
[normal]r statistical methodology
[normal],
[normal] but 
[normal]all to do with 
[normal]politics 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]              
[normal]Does the AR5 address the reliability of climate models?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]No – it attempted to finesse 
[normal]their 
[normal]inaccuracy
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.
[normal]              
[normal]Has AR5 sufficiently explained the reasons behind the widely reported hiatus in the global surface temperature record?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]No – it fudged
[normal] the issue
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.
[normal]              
[normal]Do the AR5 Physical Science Basis report’s conclusions strengthen or weaken the economic case for action to prevent dangerous climate change? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]Weaken, if not 
[normal]eliminate
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.
[normal]              
[normal]What implications do the IPCC’s conclusions in the AR5 Physical Science Basis repo
[normal]rt have for policy making both nationally and internationally? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]It should have
[normal] little either nationally or internationally because 
[normal]it 
[normal]does not make a scientific (as opposed to PR) case 
[normal]for 
[normal]ACW
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.
[normal]              
[normal]Is the IPCC process an effective mechanism for assessing 
[normal]scientific knowledge? Or has it focussed on providing a justification for political commitment?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]No to the first sentence; yes to the second
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10.
[normal]              
[normal]To what extent did political intervention influence the final conclusions of the AR5 Physical Science Basis s
[normal]ummary? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]It i
[normal]s a political document like its predecessors
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]crawled over by officials from various governments 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11.
[normal]              
[normal]Is the rate at which the UK Government intends to cut CO2 emissions appropriate in light of the findings of the IPCC AR5 Physical Science Basis report? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]Most inappropriate
[normal] because the conclusions drawn 
[normal]from 
[normal]the science are so weak
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]12.
[normal]              
[normal]What relevance do 
[normal]the IPCC’s conclusions have in respect of the review of the fourth Carbon Budget? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]THE VERY COSTLY GREEN/DECARBONISING AGENDA IS NEITHER PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE IN ACHIEVING ITS BASIC OBJECTIVES OF REDUCING CO2 EMISSIONS[bold]:-[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]NOR WILL OUR EFFORT DO MUCH IF ANYTHING TO SAVE THE PLANET.  [bold]Britain emits about 1.2% of the world’s greenhouse gases. 
[normal]Although we may virtually eliminate the 30
[normal] [bold]Mtoe of coal
[normal] we used in power plants in 2012, between 2001-09 the use of coal in China and India increased by 967Mtoe
[normal] and is forecast to increase by a further 3300TWh p.a. by 2035, which is about 30 times the current output of Britain’s coal plants (109TWh in 2011). 
[normal]A
[normal]s Peter Lilley MP pointed out in a recent speech in Westminster Hall, the increase in China’s CO2 emissions in 2011 was 200Mt more than the total emitted by the UK
[normal]. In 
[normal]a presentation on 
[normal]14 October 2013
[normal] to the World Energy Congress Wood Mackenzie forecast
[normal] that global coal consumption is expected to rise by 25% by the end of the decade slightly overtaking oil
[normal] on energy source.  
[normal]While the British government is obsessed with driving unabated coal plants off the system, ten 900MW new coal plants are being comp[bold]leted in [bold]Germany[bold] and the [bold]Netherlands[bold].[bold]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]The lunatics really are running the asylum now – and 
[normal]incompetent
[normal] lunatics in DECC do not care a jot for the customers’ pockets.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The carbon budgeting process and the Climate Change Committee should be scrapped as [bold]an irrelevant waste of money[bold].[bold]&#xa0;[bold]BOTH THE IPCC AND THE CCC HAVE FAILED TO PROVIDE A SOUND ASSESSMENT OF THE STATE OF CLIMAT SCIENCE.  WE NEED A TRULY INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT UNDERTAKE[bold]N BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO VESTED [bold]COMMERCIAL OR REPUTATIONAL INTEREST IN THE OU[bold]TCOME.[bold]&#xa0;
