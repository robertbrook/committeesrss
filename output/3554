defaultSUMMARY
default&#xa0;
default1.1
default              
defaultThe changing context
default&#xa0;
default2007, when the Fourth AR was published, was the height of the IPCC’s prest
defaultige and the case for concern about anthropogenic climate warming (ACW).  The IPCC and Senator Al Gore were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Subsequently the credibility of the IPCC’s treatment of science has taken some serious blows:-
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default*
default              
defaultthe “hockey stick” was the star of Assessment Report 3 (AR3) in 2001 and was included in AR4 in 2007.  The hockey stick claimed that the global temperature declined since about 1000 to the end of the nineteenth century,
default when it has been increasing due to CO2
default&#xa0;
default*
default              
defaultthe report falsely claimed that “more likely than not human activities have contributed to an increase in tropical cyclone intensity” 
default&#xa0;
default*
default              
defaultCanadian journalist Donna Laframboise showed that contrary to IPCC claims 
defaultthe reports are not based exclusively on peer reviewed input from leading scientists were not true
default&#xa0;
default*
default              
defaultthe 
defaultIPCC had to withdraw its claim that the glaciers in the 
defaultHimalayas
default were likely to melt by 2035
default&#xa0;
default*
default              
defaultthe 
defaultNongovernmental Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC) 
defaultwas set up to provide an alternative – and less politically alarmist slanted - story

defaultGlobal CMIP5 RCP45 39 models, annual Tas reference base 1979-1983, 7-yr running average
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThere has been increasing realization that the IPCC’s interpretative material – in 
defaultparticular the Summary for Policy Makers but also so
defaultme of the base science – is not independent but there is a political agenda behind some – if not much – of it
default:-  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default“The 
defaultclimate summit in Cancun —- is not a climate conference, but one of the largest economic conferences since the Second World War
default…One must say clearly 
defaultthat we redistribute de facto the world’s wealth by climate policy.”
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default“We are an intergovernmental body and we do what the governme
defaultnts of the world want us to do,” he said. “If the governments decide we should do things differently and come up with a vastly different set of products we would be at their beck and call.”
default&#xa0;

default              
defaultThe IPCC’S Fifth Assessment Report
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are a few improvements in the science in AR5 – the IPCC has dumped the hockey stick, and has dropped claims that hurricanes will increase in intensity and that flooding and drought will become more serious.  The main shortcoming is that the report is
default unable to explain the 16 
defaultor 17 year pause in global warming.   Next, despite the expenditure of hundreds of £M on climate models they do not track global temperature accurately. The (leaked) final draft Summary for Policy Makers identified that 
default“Models do
default not generally reproduce the observed reduction in surface warming trend over the last 10
default–15 years”
default.  
defaultThis admission di
defaultsappeared in the f
defaultinal version
default, which massaged the inaccuracy of the models
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultRichard Lindzen, Professor 
defaultEmeritus,

default, Oceans, and Climate, Massachusetts Institute of Technology
default, observed:-
default&#xa0;
default“I think that 
defaultthe latest IPCC report
default has truly sunk to level of hilarious incoherence.
default&#xa0;
default They are proclaiming increased confidence in their models as the discrepancies between their models and observations increase…
default&#xa0;
defaultTheir excuse for the absence of warming over the past 17 years is that the h
defaulteat is hiding in the deep ocean.
default&#xa0;
default However, this is simply an admission that the models fail to simulate the exchanges of heat between the surface layers and the deeper oceans…
default&#xa0;
defaultIf climate science were a “normal” sciencedefault fdefaultailure of the models to predict thedefault temperature pause would lead many scientists to conclude that the assumptions underlying the models wdefaultere defaultwrong and we should go back to the drawing broaddefault.  defaultBut climate science is politicised with extensive commercial, reputational and grant funding vesteddefault interests hanging on it.  So the IPCC defaulttries to massage the failure of the climate models and absurdly defaultto defaultclaim defaultan defaultincreased confidence in the models as the discrepancy between models and observations increase.  default&#xa0;
defaultDon Easterbrook, Professor of Geology at W

default, 
defaultcomments “the IPCC report must be considered the grossest misrepresentation of data ever published…After all these years, IPCC still doesn’t get it

defaultwe’ve been thawing out from the Little Ice Age for several hundred years but

default&#xa0;
defaultEasterbrook concludes “These are only a few examples of the highly biased, 
defaultmisrepresentations of material in the 2013 IPCC report.  As seen by the examples above, it isn’t science at all – it’s dogmatic, political, propaganda.”

defaultIn the subdomain of irradiation, strong fluctuations do indeed occur, of up to 70%.  Ultraviolet 
defaultlight is converted to heat in the ozone layer and ionosphere and, as a result, leads to a formidable temperature rollercoaster with magnitudes of change reaching several degrees Celsius – all synchronized with the 11-year solar cycle…Furthermore, the sun’s
default magnetic field also fluctuates in sync with the 11-year solar cycles, and all this has a profound impact of 10-20% on cosmic rays…These cosmic particles seed clouds in the lower atmosphere, which cool the earth.

defaultA recent NASA press release comments:-

defaultThere is, however, a dawning realization among researchers that even these 
defaultapparently tiny variations can have a significant effect on terrestrial climate. A new report issued by the National Research Council (NRC), “The Effects of Solar Variability on Earth’s Climate,” lays out some of the surprisingly complex ways that solar ac

defaultJasper Kirby, Head of fthe CLOUD Experiment at CERN, recently gave a thorough review showing strong  correlations between cosmic rays, solar cycles and earth’s clim

defaultResponse to the Committee’s questions
default&#xa0;
defaultWhile the IPCC has addressed a few of the criticisms 
defaultof its 
defaulttoo often 
defaultsloppy and “politicially” slanted approach in the past, it 
defaulthas not explained 
defaultthe reasons for the global temperature pause but attempted to fudge it, and it does not analyse why the climate models – on which £100Ms have been invested – are so inaccurate; th
defaultey are useless for forecasting temperature change.  The report includes a number of factual errors and does not 
defaultadequately 
defaultconsider the 
defaultpossible 
defaulteffect of the sun
default on the climate
default.  The IPCC 
defaulthas not addressed the main 
defaultquestion 
defaultabout the extent of man’s 
defaulteffect on the climate
default, merely asserted a belief buttressed by phony statistical 
defaultwording about 
defaultthe reliability of its view.
defaultThe truth is that far from being “settled” – which is a political or bureaucratic concept, not a scientific one – climate sciences ar
defaulte immature and there are many areas that merit extensive research.  AR5 doubtless 
defaultreflects the views of “state scientists” in 
defaultBritain
default (i.e. those directly on the government’s payroll including the Met Office, and those in universities seeking grants funded
default by the government, who must be politically correct).  But it does not reflect the views of many 
defaultcompetent and 
default“free” 
defaultthinking 
defaultclimate scientists in 
defaultNorth America
default, ANZAC, and some continental countries.
default  Because of the dominance of state scientists, we liv
defaulte in a parochial little bubble of ignorant (so called) consensus.
default&#xa0;
defaultFrom the analyse
defaults 
defaultin 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 
defaultI draw the main conclusion that AR5 is a most unsatisfactory report
default and should not be the basis for any policies in any country.
default  
defaultThe Committee asks “
defaultW
defaulthat relevance do the IPCC’s conclusions have in respect of the review of the fourth Carbon Budget?

defaultNOR WILL OUR EFFORT DO MUCH IF ANYTHING TO SAVE THE PLANET.  defaultBritain
default emits 
defaultabout 1.2% of the world’s greenhouse gases. 
defaultAlthough we may virtually eliminate the 30
default defaultMtoe of coal we used in power plants in 2012, between 2001-09 the use of coal in China and India increased by 967Mtoe and is forecast to increase by a further 3300TWh 
defaultp.a. by 2035, which is about 30 times the current output of Britain’s coal plants (109TWh in 2011). A
defaults Peter Lilley MP pointed out in a recent speech in Westminster Hall, the increase in 
defaultChina
default’s CO2 emissions in 2011 was 200Mt more than the total emitted b
defaulty the

defaultTHE CHANGING CONTEXT
default&#xa0;
default2007, when the Fourth AR was published, was the height of the IPCC’s prestige and 
defaultpublic belief in 
defaultthe case for concern about anthropogenic climate warming (ACW).  The IPCC and Senator Al Gore
default were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and a survey showed that 90
default% of people were concerned about ACW.  In 
defaultBritain
default the concern was manifest in the Climate Change Bill.  Subsequently the 
defaultcredibility 
defaultof the IPCC
default’s treatment of science has taken some 
defaultserious blows
default which are described in the following section
default.  The IPCC has
default promoted some obviously flawed science; the models it uses failed to track temperature, notably the pause in temperature rise; climategate; challenges from internet blogs; 
defaultand an

default&#xa0;
defaultPachauri is here letting the cat out of the bag.  The first word of IPCC is intergovernmental, and governments are political bodies

defaultTHE IPCC’S FIFTH ASSESSMENT

default&#xa0;
defaultThere are a few improvements in the science

default – the IPCC has dumped the hockey stick and reinsta
defaultted the Medieval Warming Period, and 
defaulthas dropped claims that hurricanes will increase in intensity and 
defaultthat 
defaultflooding and drought will become more serious
default.  
defaultBut it is strangely quiet about the feedback of climate sensitivity, which has inflated the estimate
defaults of future supposed warming by CO2
default, and 
defaultit is slightly
default more modest in its estimates of future warming.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe main shortcomings are that the report is unable to explain the 16
default or 
default17 year
default pause in global warming, a shortcoming which is linked to the secon
defaultd shortcoming.  Namely despite the expenditure of hundreds of £
defaultM
default on climate models
default they do not track global temperature accurately.  Furthermore there are factual errors in the report, and it does not take account of the increasing evidence for the influen
defaultce of the sun

default&#xa0;
defaultThe relevant text is in Box 9.2 of the full report and runs to

defaultAnother storyline is that 16 or 17 years is not long

defaultTheir base period of 1951-2013, against which they have measured post 1998 trends, includes:-

default22 years of warming – 1979-2001
default3.
default              
default12 years of cooling again – 2001-2013
default&#xa0;
defaultSo, in total, during 40 out of the 62 years there has been a cooling trend. They are comparing a statistically insignificant amount of warming since 1998, with three 
defaultdecades of cooling. The result is to make this small trend sound much more significant than it is.
defaultIt would surely have been more honest to have compared the post 1998 trend with the 1979-98 period. If they had have done this, of course, most people would r

defaultIn “The Neglected Sun”, recently published by Professor Fritz Vahrenholt
default and 
defaultSebastian Lüning
default, the authors point out

defaultoverlooks a crucial detail.  In the subdomain of irradiation, strong fluctuations do indeed occur, of up to 70%.  Ultraviolet light is converted to heat in the ozone layer and ionosphere and, as a result
default, leads to a formidable temperature rollercoaster with magnitudes of change reaching several degrees Celsius – all synchronized with the 11-year solar cycle…Furthermore, the sun’s magnetic field also fluctuates in sync with the 11-year solar cycles, and al
defaultl this has a profound impact of 10-20% on cosmic rays…These cosmic particles seed clouds in the lower atmosphere, which cool the earth.  
defaultIn other words, intense solar activity leads to less cloud cover, resulting in more warming, whereas weak solar activitdefaulty leads to more cloud cover and so causes coolingdefault (emboldening added)default…defaultAnd just a few per cent variation in cloud cover results in a change in the earth’s irradiative energy budget equal to the projected amount of the warming the IPCC claims that anthropoge
defaultnic CO2 causes.”
default&#xa0;
default“Fluctuations in solar activity are manifested over a wide range of cycles and have characteristic cycle lengths of between 11 and 2,300 years. 
defaultEspecially important in today’s context is the 1000 year cycle, which led to unusually high irdefaultradiation intensities during the second half of the twentieth century. Over recent decades, the sun has been in one of its most active phases of the last 10,000 years.  Solar magnetic field activity more than doubled between 1901 and 1995.  Similar irradiadefaulttion maximums occurred 1,000 years ago (the Medieval warm period) and 2000 years ago (the Roman warm period).  In both periods, pronounced climate warming took place.  The Roman warm period, the Medieval warm period and today’s Modern Optimum (since 1850) defaultare well documented.  Between those warm periods the sun’s activity decreased and this led to distinct cold phases – the Vandal Cold Period and the Little Ice Agedefault…”default(emboldening added)default&#xa0;default“We are by no means claiming that CO2 has had no impact on today’s 
defaultclimate events.  However, we are able to show that at least half of the warming of the last 30 years can be attributed to the sun and oceanic oscillations.  CO2 could be responsible for the other half of the warming, but its share may be even less than tha

defaultA recent NASA press release commen

default&#xa0;
default“
defaultThere is, however, a dawning realization among researchers that even these apparently tiny variations can have a significant effect on terrestrial climate. A new report issued by the National Research Council (NRC), “The Effects of Solar Variability

defaultTHE COMMITTEE ON CLIMATE CHA
defaultNGE (CCC)
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Committee has just published what is in its Chapter 1 “Update of climate science” an uncritical endorsement of AR5
default.  It begins by stating:-
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultUncritical acceptance 
defaultof the IPCC story
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultEven the IPCC did not run this spin
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe IPCC backed off making an estimate of climate sensitivity, see footnote 17
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIt 
defaultrecasts a number of well worn 
defaultcanards
default including:-
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultSee 3.3. for the facts on continuing sea level rise for which there is no evidence of an acceleration rise, 
defaultand “
defaultNor is there any basis for blaming it on CO
default2
default because sea level has been rising for 150 years, long before CO
default2
default levels began to rise after 
default1945”
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThis claim is just 
defaultnot 
defaulttrue; the ice in 
defaultAntarctica
default is incre
defaultasing 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultGlobal surface temperatures are the highest since temperature records began 150 years ago, but were at least as high in the Medieval and Roman Warming Periods when the level of CO2 was less.  While similar 
defaultfluctuations have been seen and are to be expected, that is no indication of long term warming
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe magnitude of feedback is an open question.  Einstein once observed that his theories could be disproved by o
defaultne experiment whose results did not concur with theory
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Committee clearly 
defaultbelieves in models, and makes no comment on their failure
default.  As Julius Caesar long ago observed “Fere liben
defaultter homines quo
defaultd volunt credunt”
default&#xa0;
default5
default.
default              
defaultTHE COMMITTEE’S QUESTIONS
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Committee invites responses
default 
defaultto 
defaultthe following questions:
default-
default&#xa0;
default1.
default              
defaultHow robust are the conclusions in the AR5 Physical Science Basis report? Have the IPCC adequately addresses criticisms of previous reports? How much scope is there to question of the report’s conclusions? 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultThe 
defaultheadline 
defaultconclusion
defaults
default are flimsy; the IPCC has addressed some of the criticisms but not the main ones 
defaultabout the extent of man’s effect on the climate.
default  There is extensive scope to question the
default AR5’s 
defaultconclusion
default 
defaultabout a very basic 
defaultissue
default, namely 
default“Statistical Analyses of Surface T
defaultemperatures in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report” by Douglas Keenan
default 
defaultexplained the complexities, uncertainties, in developing trends from time series data, in particualr the pitfalls in choosing
default statistical 
default models. He then shows the simplistic manner 
defaultin wh
defaultich the IPCC 
defaultadopted a model
default; and 
defaultargu
defaultes
default that (S 10.2.2) “[the IPCC] effectively acknowledges that we do not understand the data well enough to choose a statistical 
defaultmodel.”  He concludes “
defaultSimply put, no one has yet presented valid statistical analysis of a
defaultny observational data to show global warming is real. Moreover, that applies to any warming - whether attributable to humans or to nature.  This is implied by S 10.2.2 and indeed is clear from statistics”
default&#xa0;
default2.
default              
defaultTo what extent does AR5 reflect the range of 
defaultviews among climate scientists?
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultIt reflects the views of “state scientists” in Britain (i.e. those directly 
defaulto
defaultn the government’s payroll inclu
defaultding the Met Office
default, and those in universities seeking gra
defaultnts 
defaultfunded by the government
default,
default 
defaultwho must be
default politically c
defaultorrect).  But it does not reflect the views of many “free” 
defaultclimate scientists 
defaultin 
defaultNorth America
default, ANZAC, and some continental countries
default.  
defaultThe fact that virtually all, if not all, defaultworking defaultclimate scientists in Britain aredefault directly or indirectly defaultstate scientisdefaultts is probably the reason why there are (to my knowledge) no sdefaultcdefaulteptic scientists in Britaindefault&#xa0;
default3.
default              
defaultCan any of the areas of the science now be considered settled as a result of AR5’s publication, if so which?
default&#xa0;
default What areas need further effort to reduce the levels
default of uncertainty?
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultFew, if any, areas can be regarded as settled.  
defaultThere are ma
defaultny a
defaultreas 
defaultthat need research, perhaps starting with a better understanding of the 
defaulteffect of the sun on the climate and all that entails
default; the functioning of clouds and water vapou
defaultr; the sensitivity of temperature to CO2, which is fundamental to forward temperature estimates if CO2 is
default taken as a driver of temperature
default; and the dynamics of oceans.  In a seminar last year in the House of Commons Professor Lindzen commented 
defaultthat 
default“climat
defaulte science is an immature science”, i.e. there is a lot to learn.  He went on to add “It cannot even forecast the past, let alone the future”
default&#xa0;
default4.
default              
defaultHow effective is AR5 and the summary for policymakers in conveying
default&#xa0;
default what is meant by uncertainty in scientific
default terms ? Would a focus on risk rather than uncertainty be useful?
default&#xa0;

defaultThe a

defaultnothing to do with scien
defaulttific o
defaultr statistical methodology
default,
default but 
defaultall to do with 
defaultpolitics 
default&#xa0;
default5.
default              
defaultDoes the AR5 address the reliability of climate models?
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultNo – it attempted to finesse 
defaulttheir 
defaultinaccuracy
default&#xa0;
default6.
default              
defaultHas AR5 sufficiently explained the reasons behind the widely reported hiatus in the global surface temperature record?
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultNo – it fudged
default the issue
default&#xa0;
default7.
default              
defaultDo the AR5 Physical Science Basis report’s conclusions strengthen or weaken the economic case for action to prevent dangerous climate change? 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultWeaken, if not 
defaulteliminate
default&#xa0;
default8.
default              
defaultWhat implications do the IPCC’s conclusions in the AR5 Physical Science Basis repo
defaultrt have for policy making both nationally and internationally? 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultIt should have
default little either nationally or internationally because 
defaultit 
defaultdoes not make a scientific (as opposed to PR) case 
defaultfor 
defaultACW
default&#xa0;
default9.
default              
defaultIs the IPCC process an effective mechanism for assessing 
defaultscientific knowledge? Or has it focussed on providing a justification for political commitment?
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultNo to the first sentence; yes to the second
default&#xa0;
default10.
default              
defaultTo what extent did political intervention influence the final conclusions of the AR5 Physical Science Basis s
defaultummary? 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultIt i
defaults a political document like its predecessors
default,
default 
defaultcrawled over by officials from various governments 
default&#xa0;
default11.
default              
defaultIs the rate at which the UK Government intends to cut CO2 emissions appropriate in light of the findings of the IPCC AR5 Physical Science Basis report? 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultMost inappropriate
default because the conclusions drawn 
defaultfrom 
defaultthe science are so weak
default&#xa0;default12.
default              
defaultWhat relevance do 
defaultthe IPCC’s conclusions have in respect of the review of the fourth Carbon Budget? 
default&#xa0;
defaultTHE VERY COSTLY GREEN/DECARBONISING AGENDA IS NEITHER PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE IN ACHIEVING ITS BASIC OBJECTIVES OF REDUCING CO2 EMISSIONSdefault:-default&#xa0;default&#xa0;

defaultNOR WILL OUR EFFORT DO MUCH IF ANYTHING TO SAVE THE PLANET.  defaultBritain emits about 1.2% of the world’s greenhouse gases. 
defaultAlthough we may virtually eliminate the 30

default we used in power plants in 2012, between 2001-09 the use of coal in China and India increased by 967Mtoe
default and is forecast to increase by a further 3300TWh p.a. by 2035, which is about 30 times the current output of Britain’s coal plants (109TWh in 2011). 
defaultA
