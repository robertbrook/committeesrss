[[[ (FDC16)]]]We welcome the opportunity to respond to your enquiry on fiscal devolution to cities and city regions. The GBCC supports the principle of greater localisation of economic development to Cities. We are proponents of the wider devolution agenda as expressed in Lord Heseltine’s ‘No Stone Unturned in Pursuit of Growth’ report. Nonetheless, we are concerned to ensure that greater fiscal devolution would support economic growth. As such, we echo the observations of the British Chambers of Commerce and recommend that the proposals of the City Centred Campaign are considered by government as part of a root-and-branch review of local taxation and revenue raising options within the current parliament. The GBCC is one of the UK’s oldest and largest Chambers. It has nearly 3,000 member companies that employ over 200,000 plus affiliate organisations representing 15,000 people. It offers extensive services to industry and commerce, having served the interests of business for three centuries, promoting trade locally, nationally and internationally. Members of Greater Birmingham Chambers of Commerce: Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, Burton &amp; District Chamber, Chase Chamber, Lichfield &amp; Tamworth Chamber, Solihull Chamber, The Institute of Asian Businesses, Future Faces and the British American Business Council.&#xa0;Chambers of Commerce are at the forefront of the localism movement. The GBCC founded the Greater Birmingham and Solihull LEP with Birmingham City Council. We actively supported the GBSLEP City Deal, reform of local government finance and a host of other initiatives that give more power to local communities. We think there is scope to greatly increase the use of local government finance vehicles like tax increment financing and the community infrastructure levy to take forward local infrastructure investment, where this is economically viable, and we welcome a continued debate on how we can deepen the progress already made, and of course how we can strengthen the role of the Chambers in this. Moreover, we believe there is a huge case to be made for freeing up Cities to define their own priorities and plan at the local level how funding from central government is directed. There is also a role for Cities in linking up local and national services- and there should be a greater duty placed upon quangos and national departments to reflect a “bottom up” approach. There is significant evidence to indicate that this would have a manifold impact on our Cities’ job and wealth creation. We echo Lord Heseltine’s observation that even where taxes are appropriately collected and directed from the centre, that the “initiative and delivery [of policies and programmes] should rest with local leaders”. However, there are risks around wholesale devolution of financial freedoms particularly exacerbated by the current retrenchment in local government. It must be a critical priority of the nation that we do nothing to undermine the economic competitiveness of our Cities- and, of course, with new freedoms comes new opportunities for additional taxes and levies aimed at business which could stymie the growth of the private sector. There are numerous examples of well-intentioned local authority-led initiatives like the Living Wage increasing business operation costs – as well as a growing likelihood of the implementation of business taxes like workplace parking levy being utilised more extensively across England and Wales. The cumulative burden of such initiatives could be crippling for inward investment and business growth, wealth creation and jobs. As such, we support a root-and-branch review of local taxation, ideally before the end of the current parliament. For example, whilst we do not support the devolution of business rate-setting to local authorities, the system needs to be more responsive to the local impacts of the business cycle including through reform of the valuations system that underpins business rates. This review should consider in full the proposals of the City Centred campaign, but with a clear priority of supporting economic growth and ensuring our cities are attractive centres for inward investment and business start-ups.
