[[[onitoring]]]The Court of Common Council is the Police Authority for the City of London Police and this function is delegated to and exercised by the Police Committee which provides independent scrutiny and challenge of the Force. (

[[[Please note]]]: The City of London Corporation does not have a Police &amp; Crime Commissioner). The Police Committee in consultation with the City of London Police sets the Force’s priorities and measures annually. Workshops are held between November &amp; January each year and in the February - the draft Policing Plan for the following year is agreed by the Police Committee.  Our Policing Plan priorities for 2013-14 are Counter-Terrorism, Economic Crime, Public Order, Crime Reduction, Road Safety and Antisocial Behaviour. The priorities are underpinned by a small number of performance measures or targets. Delivery of these targets is monitored and scrutinised by the Force’s Performance Management Group (which is attended by Police Authority staff, the Head of the Community Safety Team and the Corporation’s Performance Management Team) and by the Chairman of the Performance &amp; Resources Management (Police) Sub-Committee. Whilst the Police Committee sets a target to reduce crime, this does not stipulate a numerical or percentage reduction. In addition, the Committee is working with the City of London Police to consider how new crime outcomes can support policing priorities next year. Currently, no specific targets have been set on detection rates.  This approach reduces the potential impact on our police recording crime practices.  

[[[Impact on Police Crime Recording Practices]]]The impact of using performance targets on current police crime practices is minimal – as there are adequate checks and balances in place to ensure that police crime recording practices are robust.  Assurances are provided by the checks (set out below). In addition, any in-year adjustments to the crime performance statistics are challenged by the Corporation and the Police Committee Members – particularly with regard to satisfaction statistics, the violent crime and acquisitive crime statistics.  The Force’s ACPO team also routinely seek assurance through the commissioning of independent audits.  The Force has embarked on a cultural change programme – “City Futures” – which aims to make the City of London Police “a worldwide centre of excellence for our policing services”.  Part of the programme of change is a focus on improving service delivery through the setting of robust service outcomes – that will improve service performance. The new arrangements will include a further strengthening of the Force’s police recording practices to ensure that they are robust and transparent. 

[[[How do you assure yourself that the recorded crime figures for your area are correct? To what extent can you trust the crime statistics for your area? ]]]As a Police Authority, there are a number of ways where we are assured about the reliability of our crime statistics. The following checks (provide the Police Authority with a level of assurance that the crime statistics are reliable):

[[[Independent Audit]]]

[[[ commissioned by the Force]]]The Force commissioned an independent audit of its crime data in June 2013. This was carried out by a team who had previously worked for HMIC on Data Quality inspections.  The outcome of this review was received by our Performance and Resource Management Sub-committee (P &amp; RM Sub-committee) in September 2013 The report concluded that: ‘There is clear evidence that ethical crime and incident data is of utmost importance within the City of London. ‘ &#xa0;&#xa0; ‘The City of London police maintains an impressively high standard of capturing reports of crime, thus ensuring such crimes are correctly classified. The force Crime and Incident Registrar remains a strong and powerful advocate for ethical decision making.’ The Independent Auditors also commented favourably on the Force’s governance arrangements - which ensured that the quality of incident and crime recording remained an area of strategic focus.

[[[HMIC Review of Crime ]]]

[[[and]]]

[[[ Incident Reports]]]The HMIC conducts a regular review of Crime and Incident reports to ensure the correct and ethical reporting of both, and that incidents are correctly classified as crimes when necessary. The last COLP report was published in January 2012, and stated:“Crimes in the City of London are generally recorded accurately and in accordance with National Crime Recording Standards (NCRS).” “The City of London Police efficiently recorded and classified reports of crimes”. The report concluded “senior officers in the force were clearly committed to maintaining high standards of crime recording, and this was well supported by police committee. The force conducts comprehensive crime and incident audit programmes, the results of which are presented at regular crime performance meetings. This means the force can have confidence in the crime figures it produces.”

[[[Police Routine Checks]]]The Force regularly reviews its crime recording standards to supplement the HMIC inspection work. In addition, the Force’s integrity dashboard reported to the Police Committee includes an update on the monthly dip sampling of crime reports. This ensures standards are maintained.

[[[ Checks]]]

[[[ ]]]The Corporation is currently considering introducing a further independent check of Crime Statistics through the Corporation’s Internal Audit Service.  The plan is to build it into their annual Police audit programme.  &#xa0;January 2014&#xa0; The P &amp; RM Sub-committee is a sub-committee of our Police Committee and its remit is to ensure the Force is efficient, effective and delivering value for money.
