[[[Written evidence submitted by ECPAT UK]]]ECPAT UK is a leading UK-based children’s rights organisation campaigning to protect children from trafficking, as well as sexual exploitation in travel and tourism.ECPAT UK is a charity with a long history of campaigning against child trafficking and exploitation in the UK, producing the first research into trafficking of children in the UK in 2001. An on-going programme of research, training and advocacy informs our campaigning efforts. ECPAT UK has been instrumental in raising awareness in government of the plight of children trafficked into the UK for all forms of exploitation, including sexual exploitation. We also work directly with child victims of trafficking, which provides insight into the experiences of these children and the processes/systems that they encounter.&#xa0;ECPAT UK written evidence1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; ECPAT UK welcomes the positive steps taken by the Department for Education in order to improve the regulations on children’s homes and the standards associated with accommodating children in this way.&#xa0;2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; ECPAT UK has previously identified that there are no commonly agreed safety and protection standards across the UK for the placement of children who are suspected or known to have been trafficked. This inconsistency has allowed safeguarding issues to be side-lined and, in some instances, ignored leading to further harm and risk to the child.&#xa0;3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In 2009, the Home Affairs Select Committee report on human trafficking raised the issue of trafficked children missing from care and raised concerns about traffickers who may be “using the care home system for vulnerable children as holding pens for their victims until they are ready to pick them up”. It is therefore of huge importance that Children’s Homes regulations take into account the particular vulnerabilities of these children. &#xa0;4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The All Party Parliamentary Group for Runaway and Missing Children stated in its 2012 inquiry: “Trafficked children from abroad are particularly being let down and their needs ignored because the authorities view child trafficking as an immigration control issue. Hundreds of them disappear from care every year and are never found again.”&#xa0;5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Recent official figures report a 12% increase in child trafficking from 2011 to 2012 with 549 potential child victims identified in 2012. This highlights the very real need for this group of children to be considered in any changes made to children in care. &#xa0;6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We are extremely concerned that young people turning 18, who have come to the UK as unaccompanied asylum-seeking children and may be victims of trafficking, are going missing from care and breaking ties with support providers because they fear being detained in immigration removal centres or being forcibly removed from the UK back to a country where they experienced violence and abuse. This is particularly the problem with children leaving care who have had negative decisions in their asylum or immigration claim. We believe that they need to be recognised as particularly vulnerable to going missing from care as (a) they will normally not be under a care order (b) they have no family or anyone with parental responsibility looking out for them and (c) there is no-one to hold authorities to account if they do go missing.&#xa0;7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Much has been reported in the media of late with regard to accommodating children in out of area placements, with around 46% of children being accommodated outside of their home authority – and the particular risks this may present. While this must be scrutinised with regard to what is in the best interests of children who are citizens of the UK, ECPAT UK would like to make sure there is consideration of how any changes to this practice may affect migrant children, many of whom may have been trafficked. &#xa0;8.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Trafficked children are at a huge risk of going missing from local authority care, most within days of coming to the notice of authorities. A decision to accommodate a child outside of the area where they were exploited can be an important step in attempting to reduce the chance of the child being retrafficked and/or going missing.  By doing so, the relationship between the child and their trafficker/trafficking network can be interrupted making it more difficult for traffickers to find them. This can also help the child to feel more safe. &#xa0;9.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; When placing a child from a minority ethnic or community background into a family or area of the same culture, it is important to consider whether traffickers have links into that cultural community. Children may fear that this is the case, even if it is not. In our experience, children can be very fearful of talking to their own community as they think, sometimes rightly, that there are connections with their traffickers.&#xa0;10.&#xa0;&#xa0; Reciprocal placement arrangements could help the provision of out-of-area placements for children at risk. In larger counties, children can be placed at some distance from their traffickers as this can reduce placement costs. &#xa0;11.&#xa0;&#xa0; Recently proposed changes to the statutory guidance on children missing from home or care focuses on the risks of children of children to child sexual exploitation (CSE) in particular. We welcomed this move towards improving the safeguarding response of practitioners to what is a very vulnerable cohort of children. However, we raised concerns in our consultation response to this new guidance that there is a distinct lack of recognition of the links between missing from care and other types of trafficking and exploitation.&#xa0;12.&#xa0;&#xa0; Young people who run away or go missing are vulnerable to a wide range of exploitation in the context of trafficking, including sexual, forced labour, forced criminality, domestic servitude, forced marriage, benefit fraud, FGM, gang exploitation and organ harvesting. Because these issues are inter-related, young people may be vulnerable to more than one issue while missing. &#xa0;13.&#xa0;&#xa0; In particular, research has shown that missing is strongly linked to trafficking for forced criminality, including the cultivation of cannabis. Of the 161 children who went missing in data from the NSPCC’s Child Trafficking Advice Centre, 58% were being exploited for criminal activity (street-based crimes) and cannabis cultivation. The UKHTC’s latest figures show that criminal exploitation accounted for 24% of all child trafficking cases in the UK in 2012 (http://www.ecpat.org.uk/sites/default/files/ext-6538_ukhtc_strategic_assesssment_on_human_trafficking_2012_v1.01.pdf). We therefore want to ensure that regulations about children’s homes and guidance on missing takes into account these risks and do not focus solely on the risks of CSE for children in care. &#xa0;14.&#xa0;&#xa0; ECPAT UK welcomes the initiative that each children’s home must have a written policy for the prevention of children going missing from the home, as well as procedures to be followed if a child goes missing. &#xa0;15.&#xa0;&#xa0; This is particularly important for migrant children who may have been trafficked. As stated previously, most trafficked children who go missing do so within a short period of time of having being taken into care. Most are never found again. The NSPCC’s Child Trafficking Advice Centre (CTAC) received 715 child referrals from 13 September 2007 to 19 April 2012. One hundred and sixty one of those referrals had been reported missing at some time. Of the 161 missing trafficked children, 73 are still missing, 26 have been found, 11 returned and 18 unknown.&#xa0;16.&#xa0;&#xa0; Any in-house policies and/or guidance on safeguarding suspected child victims of trafficking in residential care must reflect the range of methods employed by the traffickers and the varying and complex risks that might force a child to ‘run away’ to their traffickers or might put them at risk of continuing contact with/exploitation by their traffickers. There must be details on the control used by traffickers and the urgent need to risk assess migrant and unaccompanied children with a view to safely accommodating them, including a referral to the National Referral Mechanism. This would enable practitioners to take a more preventative approach to missing as opposed to reacting to it once it has already occurred as, sadly, this is often too late.&#xa0;17.&#xa0;&#xa0; It has been found that early identification and an effective multi-agency response is recommended as the best way to protect children who may have been trafficked and to secure justice for those children by prosecuting their traffickers. Safe accommodation for child victims of trafficking is more than the provision of a physical placement. It also includes, within that response, consideration of the child’s psychological, legal, language, health, security needs and the impact of trauma and abuse. Most importantly, it must include the child’s own perception of safety. If the child doesn’t feel protected, they may run away and be put at further risk of harm. &#xa0;18.&#xa0;&#xa0; ECPAT UK believes that agreed protocols between the local authority should definitely involve cooperation and information sharing with the police. However, we also believe that it should include the Home Office too, with its safeguarding children obligations, as part of an effective multi-agency response. In the case of unaccompanied or migrant children, this is often the agency with the most or only known information about a young person, particularly as many trafficked children will go missing within a very short period of time after being taken into local authority care.  &#xa0;19.&#xa0;&#xa0; If English is not the first language of an unaccompanied or separated child, a suitably trained interpreter must be made available in order to ensure the child’s voice is heard and that they understand the safety processes that may be put in place or any return interview or safe and well check. &#xa0;20.&#xa0;&#xa0; ECPAT UK has consistently raised a lack of awareness and training among social workers, police and other practitioners as a major concern. We know that specialist, quality and regular training is essential to identify and safeguard children who have been trafficked. It is a particularly complex issue with varied and changing profiles. Child victims of trafficking are not just victims of child abuse, they are witnesses to a serious crime that is punishable by up to 14 years in prison. This must be taken into consideration as part of a multi-agency response in assessing the child’s needs, risks and suitable accommodation. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]21.&#xa0;&#xa0; We continue to urge the Government to move responsibility for trafficked children to the Department for Education, away from the Home Office. The DfE is the department responsible for issues affecting children, including child protection.  Since child protection issues affecting British children sit here, ECPAT UK argues that this should be the approach for 

[[[all]]] children on British shores, no matter their country of origin – responsibility for victims of trafficking should therefore sit with the DfE. This not only makes logical sense, but it would also reduce the focus on immigration for child victims of trafficking. This focus is not only sometimes misguided but it is also unhelpful in terms of ensuring that local authorities comply with their safeguarding obligations. ECPAT UK repeatedly sees cases where a child’s immigration status has been the priority and focus, and welfare needs come second, even to the point of social workers not meeting their duties as they believe the child’s country of origin should be responsible for their welfare. This prohibits successful integration and further disempowers trafficked children and does not assist them in their recovery from the trauma they have experienced. These are children that are at real risk of significant harm and need to be assessed and safeguarded appropriately within the existing child protection framework.September 2013&#xa0; EU Directive on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims http://www.cypnow.co.uk/cyp/news/1078340/childrens-home-reveals-extent-placements?WT.rss_f=News&amp;WT.rss_a=Children%27s+home+data+reveals+extent+of+out-of-area+placements  ECPAT UK (2007), Missing Out  ECPAT UK (2011), On the Safe Side: Principles of Safe Accommodation for Child Victims of Trafficking ATMG (2013), In the Dock: Examining the UK’s Criminal Justice Response to Trafficking
