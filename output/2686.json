"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by BSW Timber&#xa0;&#xa0;1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBackground&#xa0;1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBSW Timber is a primary producer of sawn timber derived from sustainably grown and certified UK forests.\n \n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFounded in 1848, BSW Timber is a family run business and the UK’s leading \nsawmiller\n and one of the top 20 \nsawmillers\n in Europe. \n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBSW employs 900\n people across 6 locations across Scotland, England and Wales as well as one plant in Latvia with a turnover over in excess of £180m. BSW Timber’s mills have a production capacity of over 1,000,000m3 of sawn timber per year and \nwe\n produce over 30% of the UK’s softwood output. \n&#xa0;\n1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBSW have almost completed a five-year £\n70\nm investment programme, including erecting a new sawmill in Fort William and installing 26MWs of biomass capacity across three sites which utilises sawmills’ own lowest vale wood co-products for fuel. Our products are made from sawn timber and are mostly used for construction, pallet, packaging, DIY, fencing and gardens. Co-products are also used for paper, panel board and energy markets. We distribute timber products throughout the UK and export to the Middle East, China, South Korea and Japan. \n&#xa0;\n1.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBSW Timber is a member of the Timber Trades Federation\n,\n UK Green Building Council\n and CBI\n. We are a supporter of the Wood for Good campaign and \nthe DEFRA-sponsored \nGrown in Britain\n Campaign\n. We have strong relationships with the Forestry Commission, Natural Resources Wales, private growers, customers, NGOs and banks. \n&#xa0;\n2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGeneral comments&#xa0;2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBSW Timber’s interest in the Housing Standard Review is as a supplier of timber as a building material. Our economic activity is dependent on a thriving construction sector, particularly in house building. We support the Government’s current initiatives to address the UK’s housing shortage. We are firm believers in our product offering a natural and renewable solution as a building component. Timber is a natural sequester of carbon and therefore offers a unique contribution to sustainable solutions. We believe its contribution should be investigated more seriously. \n&#xa0;\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have a concern that in its laudable approach to localism, Government loses its leadership role in driving sustainability standards and efficiency improvements. An appropriate balance is needed.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe support the need for some simplification of housing standards but we are concerned about the potential unintended consequences of a dilution of the progress already made in raising sustainability standards in our housing stock. The planned phasing out of the Code for Sustainable Homes must be counter-balanced by clear intent within new standards that environmental requirements are to be maintained.\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe refer to Paragraphs 42, 43 and 44 of the Consultation in which Government expresses concern about the potential proliferation of local standards and supports its proposal to issue a Policy Statement encouraging local authorities to align with local standards. We support this provided that the scope of the standard and policy statement is comprehensive enough to continue the legacy of Code for Sustainable Homes and addresses the key omission of a requirement for responsible sourcing of materials.\n&#xa0;\n2.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe \nsupport UK GBC view that \nsuitable transitional arrangements must be put into place, and where \nLocal Planning Authorities (\nLPAs\n)\n already have higher standards in place and developers are meeting those standards without difficulty (e\n.\ng\n.\n C\node for Sustainable Homes level\n 4), they should be allowed to keep those higher requirements until the new regulations take over (e\n.\ng\n.\n Part L 2016). There is no sense in weakening environmental requirements which are easily being met, only to raise them again in 2-3 years.  \n&#xa0;\n2.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn this Submission, we limit our comments largely to those areas within our expertise, that is to Chapter 7: Materials\n&#xa0;Comments on specific issues:&#xa0;\n3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nChapter 2: Space&#xa0;3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe support some level of housing space standards to ensure a decent home provision but find the Government’s proscriptive position in this at odds with their stance on materials.\n&#xa0;\n4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nChapter 3: Energy&#xa0;\n4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe support UK GBC comments on energy.\n&#xa0;\n5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nChapter 7: Materials&#xa0;5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBSW believe that the exclusion of such a key sustainability requirements as materials sourcing is a mistake. \nWe st\nrongly disagree with leaving considerations about m\naterials to the market\n and EU Policy\n. This is perhaps the biggest omission in the\n proposed new Housing Standards. \n&#xa0;\n5.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIssue\ns such as\n responsible sourcing, toxicity, Ozone depleting potential, and off-gassing of materials in air-tight homes should not be left to the market but should be addressed as a matter of urgency through new guidance and regulation.\n \n&#xa0;\n5.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMuch improvement has been made in the sustainability of products both through reducing impact and responsibly sourcing but manufacturers and suppliers can continue to respond to the sustainability agenda if the Government maintains an active interest in this area rather than leaving it to the market.\n&#xa0;\n5.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGreat progress has been made with sustainable and renewable or recyclable building materials such as timber and wood composite products which could make a valuable contribution to the UK’s 2016 zero carbon homes target. The Government has an opportunity to provide leadership to local authorities, planners and developers in meeting this target by taking forward work on embodied energy standards. We strongly recommend that the Government establish a working party to advise Government on drafting new guidelines for material standards for new homes.\n&#xa0;\n6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nConclusion&#xa0;\nWe believe that the omission of material standards from the Housing Standards Review is a mistake and presents a lost opportunity for the zero carbon agenda. We very much hope that the committee will want to robustly examine this aspect of the Government’s recommendations within the consultation. We believe that the time is right to take forward the embodied energy standards agenda to create a clearer understanding and evidence of what works. BSW would welcome the opportunity to supply further oral evidence to the committee. \n3 October 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
