[[[ (SADPD) Regional Office, Addis Ababa.]]]Upon your request for submission of written evidence on how to improve the&#xa0;inclusion of disability in the work of the Department for International Development (DFID), SADPD is pleased to submit the following recommendations. SADPD is a continental technical agency that is run and managed by experts with disabilities. It has created a credible niche in the disability programming and policy implementation process by working in partnership with the African Union (AU), Governments, Civil Society and Continental/ Regional and National Disabled People’s Organizations (NDPOs) in Africa. The Secretariat’s vision is an African continent where people with disabilities enjoy their human rights. The three overarching principles underlining the work of SADPD are disability, development and human rights.We are submitting this recommendation on behalf of SADPD’s regional office in Addis Ababa. The regional office is currently actively working on the Disability Inclusive Peace and Security Project (DIPS) in collaboration with the African Union Peace and Security Department (AU PSD). The DIPS project aims to improve the lives of persons with disabilities in conflict areas of Africa by mainstreaming disability issues in the prevention, management and resolution of conflict in the context of the AU peace and security framework. We have responded only to those areas where  we feel we have something to contribute. Thus, our recommendation focuses on disability inclusive peace and security, disaster risk management, and disability inclusive development.
