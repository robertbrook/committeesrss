"Written evidence from the British Association of Dermatologists (LTC 89)The British Association of Dermatologists is a charity whose objects are the practice, teaching, training and research of Dermatology.\n \nIt is funded by the activities of its Members.\n \n'Healthy Skin for All' is its motto.\nMany skin diseases themselves represent LTCs.People with LTCs in other organs or systems commonly get skin disease. Some skin LTCs are associated with increased physical and psychological disease.The available dermatological resource is already seriously overstretched.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nChronic skin \nconditions affect both \nthe \nyoung and old and \nmay \np\nersist \nover the course of a lifetime.\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe burden of chronic skin diseases such as leg ulcers and repeated episodes of skin cancer is increasing as the population ages.\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSkin disorders are amongst the most common long-term conditions in the UK: there are more than 2,000 different diseases.\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is a large number of genetic skin diseases; each one may only affect a small number of people, but taken together they form part of the long term skin disease burden in the UK.\n \nFor sufferers they are a life sentence of misery, physical and cosmetic disability and psychological challenges.\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSkin diseases repres\nent 34% of disease in children;\n 20% of children in the UK have eczema,\nchildren with serious skin conditions \nhave their quality of life \nimpaired to the same extent as those with chronic illnesses such as epilepsy, renal disease and diabetes.\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAcne is an extremely common skin disease \n-\n \noften \ntrivialised\n \nas a \n‘\npassing phase\n’\n of adolescence\n \n-\n \nyet it commonly persists into the 20s and even 30s and 40s in many people (\nup to 5% of all women\n).\n \nAcne scarring is permanent. Acne results in long term disabilities including difficulties in relationships and employment prospects.\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHand eczema is one of the most common reasons for disablement benefit in the UK\n \n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n3% of the population ha\ns\n psoriasis (with a third suffering since childhood).\n \n30% of psoriasis patients needing systemic treatmen\nts have been attending D\nermatology \nclinics for over 10 years.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSome lifelong diseases such as vitiligo\n,\n which results in the loss of normal skin colour\n,\n can have a devastating effect on self-esteem for people from b\nl\nack and ethnic minorities.\n \n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is estimated that several million people \nin the UK \nhave significant chronic sun damage \nresulting in \n~13,000 melanomas and ~800,000 basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers a year.\n \n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPeople with chronic sun damage \nsuffer increasing numbers of skin cancers as they age \n–\n \nthe \nageing population will have a bigger incidence of this disease.\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nC\nhronic skin disease\n can influence ‘major l\nife\n changing d\necisions\n’\n, \nwhich then \nimpact on the rest of \na \nperson’s life.\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the UK, data from the WHO Global Burden of Diseases study shows that DALYs (Disability Life-Adjusted Years) for skin conditions are as high as those for diabetes, chronic renal disease, gastrointestinal disorders or neonatal abnormalities. The reason is largely because skin disease is \nso \ncommon.\n \n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nP\natients with chronic disease \ncan be \naffected by skin disease directly\n \ndue to \nthe \neffects of \nthose diseases\n (\neg\n diabetes and HIV)\n.\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nP\neople with other LTCs \nalso \nget skin problems due to their treatments\n. This is\n \nespecially\n common when treatment includes\n drugs\n such as anti-epileptics\n,\n cancer therapies and radiotherapy, or \ntransplants \n- due to the\n drugs given to prevent transplant rejection\n.\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIncreasingly in an ageing population people are \non multiple medications: \ndermatological side-effects \nare extremely common\n,\n ranging from chronic itch\ning\n and rash\nes,\n to life threatening \ncondition\ns\n warranting \nhospitalisation\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nP\natients with chronic psoriasis have increased obesity, hypertension, \nh\ny\npercholestolaemia\n, diabetes, heart disease\n (the metabolic syndrome) \nand mortality\n.\n \n20\n% of patients with psoriasis develop chronic arthritis. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the United Kingdom, in excess of 10,400 diagnoses of depression, 7,100 diagnoses of anxiety, and 350 diagnoses of \nsuicidality\n are attributable to psoriasis annually\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n24% of the population consults a GP each year because of a skin complaint. Skin disease is one of the \nmost \ncommon reason\ns\n for a new consultation with GPs\n.\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGPs refer approximately 6.1% of these cases to secondary care and in 2010/11 873,000 such referrals were made in England with 2.9m total outpatient appointments for skin diseases.\n \n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhere is a 20% under-provision of Dermatology services\n \nin the UK: \nwith \nonly 650 Consultants\n \nin the country\n.\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDespite the above statistics, GPs receive on average no more than six days training in Dermatology during the whole of their time as undergraduate and post-graduate medical students, and only around one in five GP training schemes offer a Dermatology element\n.\n \nIt is therefore inevitable that many doctors will enter General Practice with limited knowledge and understanding of common skin diseases\n \nthat can\n often\n present significant clinical diagnostic and management problems.\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nReferrals to Dermatology services have risen as a consequence of increasing population numbers\n,\n frequency of \nskin \ndiseases\n,\n improved treatments and changing attitudes to skin conditions.\n \nThis is despite the increased number of community based services following the recommendations of the White Paper \n‘Our health, our care, our say: a new direction for community services’ (2006).\n&#xa0;\n2.              Varying the current mix of service &#xa0;\n2.1\n              \nIn the BAD’s document \n‘Guidance for Commissioning \nDermatology\n Services’\n we set out the range and scope of services which would best serve \nDermatology\n patients at different levels\n,\n including Community Pharmacists and Specialist Nurse\n-\nled clinics supporting patients with self-management, \nand covering \nprimary and intermediate care to secondary and tertiary services. The BAD supports the provision of a \ncomprehensive \nmix of services but not the promotion of one type of service over another – there will always be a need for \ncentralised\n \nhospital\n-\nbased services\n. T\nhese continue to be the most cost-effective and safe means of providing direct access to care for patients who are acutely unwell and have complex care needs.\n Increased\n Consultant\n-\nled community services and\n education of primary care doctors and nurses will all help to improve \nintegrated\n care of patients\n through a pyramid of appropriate expertise\n,\n so that patients see the right person at the right time\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.              The readiness of local NHS services to treat patients with LTCs (including multiple conditions) within the community&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nClinical Assessment and Treatment \nCentres\n \nare also used in some areas to triage and/or review GP referrals to reduce the number of patients \nreferred to\n secondary care.\n \nThe BAD recommends that GP referrals are always triaged by a \nC\nonsultant \nDermatologist\n with \nGPwSI\n and \nDermatology\n nurse support\n,\n and that referral management services should only be set up after consultation with all stakeholders, including\n the public and \nthose in secondary care\n. \nW\nithout engagement at all levels, referral management services may introduce an additional tier \nto accessing \ncare, reduce patient choice and quality of care\n,\n \nand\n worse still, \ndestabilise\n \nlocal NHS hospital\n services\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nProviding \nCare Closer to Home\n often\n \ninvolves decommissioning part\ns\n of \nDermatology\n Outpatients service\ns\n in order to provide intermediate levels of care in the community.\n \nHowever, the objective \nof such \ndecommissioning – to bring about improvements in service provision \n- \nhas not been \nrealised\n.\n Instead\n, there are \nincreased\n referrals to both community and \nhospital \nservices, rather than reduced referrals to the \nhospital \nsetting.\n \nU\nnder the existing \nAny Qualified Provider\n model, and with the use of private providers,\n \nrecognised\n \ncare pathways across \ndifferent\n levels of care can become fragmented\n.\n \nT\nhis happen\ns\n \neven when these services are provided by local clinicians under a \nLimited Liability Partnership\n. In the majority of cases where this has happened the cost of care remains the same per head of patients as the hospital service.\n \nThis cost does not, though, factor in the additional costs for patient care for those \n‘\nlost\n’\n on the referral \npathway \nbetween their GP and the community, before getting to secondary care.\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n              \nAlthough moving care closer to home has been a policy ambition for some time, referral rates to both community and secondary care services have continued to rise since its inception, and there are worrying signs that primary care is buckling under the current pressures of demand\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.              Practical assistance offered to Commissioners &#xa0;\n4.1\n              \nThe BAD has produced the document \n‘Guidance for Commissioning \nDermatology\n Services’\n \n(\n2012\n) \nwhich can be downloaded from the BAD website (www.bad.org.uk)\n,\n and the Clinical Services \nUnit \nprovide\ns\n individual support \nto \nCommissioner\ns, stakeholders and \nDermatology\n \nD\nepartments on commissioning issues. From this service and the case studies received\n,\n the unit has now produced a document called \n‘\nCommissioning a \nDermatology\n Service: Lessons for the NHS\n’\n which draws together learning from case studies, \nand provides \nreflections and recommendations \nthat\n will be of practical use to \nCommissioner\ns.\n&#xa0;\n              \nQuality Standards for Dermatology\n; \nproviding the right care for people with skin conditions\n \nis a \nmulti\n-\nstakeholder \n(including the BAD) \npublication \nand is available on the PCC website and has implications for commissioning\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.              The ability of NHS to treat multi-morbidities and the patient as a person &#xa0;\n5.1\n              \nP\natients with skin disease often require treatment for existing co-morbidities \n(for example psoriasis and \nthe \nmetabolic syndrome) \nby \ntheir\n GP and \nDermatology\n \nand other specialists\n;\n these patients need to be identified \nbec\na\nu\ns\ne\n they impact on services across the levels of care and \na\ncross specialties.\n A \nNeeds Assessment\n is therefore a crucial step in drawing up service specifications.\n&#xa0;\n5.2\n              \nDermatologist\ns are frequently required \nto review patients under \nother \nspecialist \ndepartments where treatments\n,\n both pharmacological and otherwise\n,\n can cause side-effects present\ning\n \nas skin problems \n– often causing extra distres\ns, physical morbid\nity and risk \nto an already sick individual.\n \nDrug reactions in skin are a common reason for admission to hospital and sometimes can be life-threatening.\n \nImmunosuppression\n (for example in HIV, AIDS or following organ transplants) as well as treatments for other cancers and diseases have all led to an increase in the number of people developing skin complications, including secondary skin cancers. \n&#xa0;\n5.3\n              \nIdentifying\n these \ndermatological\n co-morbi\ndit\nies\n \n(\nand their treatment\n)\n \nfrom coded information is\n particularly problematic \nas\n \nthe patient \nunder\n \ncare \nwill be \nlogged under \nanother specialty \nor \nconsultant\n. \nThe\n majority of Trusts have \ndivisional budgets\n,\n \n(\nentitled, \nfor example, \nGeneral Medicine, Medical Specialties\n,\n or hosted by another specialist department \ne.g.\n \nPlastic Surgery\n)\n, \nt\nhis\n \nfails to \nrecognise\n the work of the \nDermatology\n \nD\nepartment \nbecause it \ndoes not allow \na) \nthe \nidentifi\nc\nation \nof multidisciplinary care pathways or\n b)\n accurate planning of services \nby \nthe \nT\nrust and \nCommissioner\ns.\n \n&#xa0;\n5.4\n              \nRecognition of multi-disciplinary care pathways \nshould be highlighted to \nCommissioner\ns \nconsidering\n services with a high level of multi\nple morbidities\n \nin certain\n patient groups. Within the NHS flexibility\n and integration have evolved\n around on-call services and in-patient consultations – if these services are \ncontracted\n to private providers then the additional costs associated with these \nad-hoc\n consultations would need to be factored in.\n \n&#xa0;\n6.              The implications of an ageing population &#xa0;\n6.1\n              \nGrowth of the ageing population will increase the prevalence of skin \nLTCs\n.\n \nTh\nis is highlighted by th\ne DALY statistic\n – although this\n captures disability over the entire population, i\n.\ne\n.\n young and old, and over time\n, o\nne of the reasons why diabetes is \nless disabling is that it has \nhigher mortality\n,\n \nwhilst those with skin conditions continue to live with them into old age\n,\n increasing the \nDALY \nnumbers\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n6.2\n              \nThe skin cancer epidemic gathers pace. The vast majority of skin cancer is due to chronic photo\n-\ndamag\ne\n as a result of increased recreational exposure \nand this\n shows \nno signs of diminishing\n.\n \nMany patients will have several episodes\n of skin cancer\n \nand pre-cancer \nas they get older. There are about \n~\n1\n3\n,000 melanomas and \n~8\n00,000 other skin cancers a year in the UK.\n&#xa0;\n6.\n3\n              \nWith increasing population growth and increasing longevity it is important to invest in \nDermatology\n services\n, and training in \nDermatology\n,\n so that the burden of chronic skin disease can be better managed with better outcomes for all patients\n. This\n includ\nes\n the elderly\n a\nnd those whos\ne\n skin disease is due to an associated \nLTC\n and/or its treatment\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n7.              The interaction between mental health conditions and LTCs&#xa0;\n7.1\n              \nThe BAD \nrecognises\n \nthe strong inter-relationship of mental health conditions with long-term physical health conditions\n,\n and particularly with skin conditions \nthat\n are often both disabling and disfiguring. It is also \nimportant to acknowledge that patients may present with a skin condition which masks an underlying, untreated mental health problem. The recent BAD \ndocument\n \n‘W\norking \nP\narty\n R\neport\n \non\n M\ninimum\n S\ntandards\n \nfor\n P\nsycho\n-\nDermatology\n S\nervices \n2012’\n \noutlines key information on psychosocial support service delivery requirements. The report \ndelineates\n minimum service standards for psychosocial support.\n \n&#xa0;\n7.2\n              \nThe BAD has also recently been awarded\n,\n a Department of Health \nInnovation, Excellence &amp; Strategic Development Fund \ngrant\n \nto create a web\n-\nhub to provide psychological support to\n those suffering with\n skin condition\ns\n.\n&#xa0;\n7.3\n              \nIt should be highlighted that both these pieces of work have been driven by the under-provision\n of dermatology psychological services\n.\n \nA\n \nrecent s\ntudy\n show\ned\n that\n 17\n%\n of patients needed psychological support to help them cope with psychological conditions secondary to their skin condition, \n14% \nof patients had psychological conditions exacerbating their skin condition, 3\n%\nof patients presented with primary psychiatric disorders, \nand \n8\n%\n had worsening psychiatric problems due to concomitant skin disorders\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n8.              Conclusions&#xa0;Skin\n disease contributes hugely to LTCs in the UK; \nm\nillions of people have dermatological LTCs\n such as\n \ne\nczema, psoriasis, acne\n, \nvitiligo\n and\n occupational skin disease.\n \nAdditionally, \nthere is a \ngrow\ning sector of the ageing population with chronic\n sun-damage\n and the serial skin cancers that ensue\n.\n \nMany \nother primarily non-dermatologica\nl LTCs create significant dermatological needs, \ndue to the disease itself or to its treatment with drugs and their consequences and side effects\n.\n \nSome dermatological LTCs, especially psoriasis, are associated with significant co-morbidity – the metabolic syndrome\n and arthritis\n. \n&#xa0;\nP\nrovision of \nthe \ntype of care \naffected people \nneed \nis under\n-\nresourced, \nfragmented \nand of variable quality, i\nn terms of manpower and \nfacilities\n.\n \nThis is\n exacerbated by poor teaching and training \nof D\nermatology \nin Medical Schools and General \nP\nractice\n,\n and under-\nfunding of \nrelevant \nresearch. \n&#xa0;\nAddressing these issues of resource, training and research should lead to \ngreatly \nimprove\nd\n care \nfor\n people with LTC\ns \ndelivered by Consultant-\nled\n,\n \nvertically integrated \nservice\ns\n.\n&#xa0;\nNotes:&#xa0;The BAD documents referred to above can be found at: www.bad.org.uk under the Clinical Services menu\n.\n&#xa0;\nQuality Standards for Dermatology\n; \nproviding the right care for people with skin conditions \ncan be found on the PCC website http://www.pcc-cic.org.uk/article/quality-standards-dermatology\n&#xa0;\nMay 2013\n http://www.oncologypractice.com/fileadmin/content_pdf/san/scms_pdf/SCMS_Vol31_No4_Molecular_Diagnostics.pdf\n ..Consultant physicians working with patients, Royal College of Physicians 2011: http://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/sites/default/files/dermatology_1.pdf\n \n.\nOdhiambo\n J, Williams H, Clayton T, Robertson C, Asher MI, the ISAAC Phase Three Study group Global variations in prevalence of eczema symptoms in children from ISAAC Phase Three.\n&#xa0;\nJ Allergy \nClin\n \nImmunol\n.\n&#xa0;\n2009;124:1251–8. \ndoi\n: 10.1016/j.jaci.2009.10.009.\n \nAND\n \nShaw TE, Currie GP, \nKoudelka\n CW, Simpson EL.
