defaultKey points

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTA staff currently provide extensive support for customers in 
defaultclaiming housing costs via Housing Benefit to ensure income is secured, which includes maintaining a good working relationship with the council’s Revenues and Benefits department. This relationship is not likely to be possible as support for housing costs 
defaultmove under the DWP, especially where the customer is hard to engage and has not given consent to discuss their application. This may lead to delays in rental costs being paid
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs customers will be expected to take control of their own household finances und
defaulter Universal Credit, there is a risk that they may not also take responsibility for notifying the DWP of their change in circumstances when they move into TA – unless consent is given to TA staff. This could lead to delays in payment adjustments to include
default updated housing costs
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMonthly payments to customers could pose several issues for TA, including:
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt has been outlined that deductions, including sanctions and income above the benefit cap or from earnings of those in low-pa
defaultid employment, will be taken from the support for housing costs element of Universal Credit. There have already been difficulties in securing service charge payments from customers in TA who have had existing benefits sanctioned; this is likely to be exace
defaultrbated as more substantial deductions come into place
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAlthough exemptions to direct payment have been outlined, these need to be clarified. The qualifying period of 8 weeks non-payment before direct payments can be requested also poses a particular issue f
defaultor TA due to the transient nature of its customers
default.
default TA could not keep a household beyond one month’s missed payment due to the levels of arrears built up – the service could not afford to run like this. After one missed payment, people would be evicted. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOther issues: defaultClaimant Commitmentdefault-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis could pose particular issues for homeless people. Current information from Universal Credit pilot areas suggests that the commitment will involve customers devoting 30+ hours per week to job searches, or risk sanction
defaults. This time commitment could be problematic for a population already having to deal with associated issues around their homelessness, without a settled base. Not meeting the commitment and resultant sanctions could have serious implications for rental inc
defaultome at 
defaultTA
default. As above, if sanctioned UC meant no housing costs are paid to cover rent, this would result in eviction. 
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default“Digital by default” also presents an issue for those in TA, due to limited access to ICT facilities. Whilst some provision is available wi
defaultthin the schemes and local area, resources are limited especially when competing with others in a similar situatio
defaultn
default. In addition, it cannot be stressed enough the high level needs and vulnerability that comes with this client group – often a lack of any fo
defaultrmal education; learning difficulties; mental and physical health issues; drug and alcohol dependency issues 
defaultetc.
default will prevent this client group from being able to 
defaultengage with any digital inclusion initiatives, and as such will present major problems in te
defaultrms of them being able to use ICT facilities or engage with support staff attempting to support them in doing so. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOther issues: Household benefit capdefault, social sector size criteriadefault and TAdefault-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe definition of ‘exempt supported accommodation’
default is 
defaulttoo
default narrow
default to 
defaultreflect the actual circumstances of many homeless customers
default, as is the DWP statement that the majority of households in TA are in accommodation procured from the private sector
default. 
defaultUnder homelessness legislation, local authorities can 
defaultuse
default several types of acc
defaultommodation which is not limited to those falling within the definition of exempt
default. 
defaultIn Stockport
default almost all homeless customers are placed into accommodation managed by the ALMO on behalf of the Metropolitan Borough Council; therefore these customers, over

defaultEvidence from the Universal Credit Pathfinders has also caused further concern with regards to ‘
defaultexempt supported accommodation’. One Pathfinder has reported that 
defaultthere is some confusi
defaulton with regards to how the exemption is applied, as 
defaulta DWP representative issued advice stating that for existing Universal Credit claimants, moving in to TA / exempt supported accom
defaultmodation would be classed as a “
defaultchange of circumstances” 
defaultand the exemption
default 
defaultfor supported housing costs
default would not apply as it would with current legacy benefits. A significant proportion of TA resident intakes will require a “change of circumstances”; therefore this presents a real risk to rental income as well as posing a confusing scenario to vulnerable h
defaultomeless clients. Therefore there needs to be clarification and a uniform definition of what is classed as exempt, and how this comes to be applied from the DWP.
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe basis of entitlement to 
defaulttemporary accommodation costs in
default Universal Credit on household size
default rather than accommodation type does not take into account the demand, throughput and pressure on TA.
default This is also exacerbated by the benefit cap
default already in place
default.
default Customers are placed into TA overwhelmingly on an emergency basis, and into whichever flat/r
defaultoom vacancy is available. Due to TA schemes often being at capacity and the broad range of households within them, there is not always scope to move customers into more suitably sized accommodation. 
defaultEven where a move is possible there is a risk that some f
defaultlats, e.g. larger units carrying higher rent, 
defaultwill be 
defaultunder-occupied 
defaultdue to the on-going need to provide some form of accommodation to homeless households
default,
default 
defaultand further reduce rental income. 
defaultThe inflexibility posed by these size criteria therefore has serio
defaultus consequences for both rental income at TA, and financial pressure on customers who may n
defaulteed to meet shortfalls in rent.
