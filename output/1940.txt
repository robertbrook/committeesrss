[[[Written evidence submitted by DECC (CCS42)]]]1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a critical technology with potential to make a significant impact in reducing CO2 emissions from the power and industrial sectors in the UK and worldwide. CCS offers the opportunity to continue to utilise fossil fuels, and enjoy the energy security benefits this brings, but with vastly reduced emissions. CCS is also a critical part of meeting emissions reduction targets in a cost effective way. Whilst CCS is not currently competitive with other low carbon forms of generation there is the potential for costs to fall significantly as deployment increases. Modelling in both the UK and internationally indicates it will be significantly cheaper to meet emissions reduction targets with CCS in the energy mix, rather than without. 2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; However, there are currently a range of technical and economic barriers to deployment which impede projects coming forward independently in the UK and elsewhere. In recognition of the potential of CCS, the Government has introduced a comprehensive package of financial and regulatory support designed to help overcome these barriers. The Commercialisation Programme will demonstrate the full integrated CCS chain at commercial scale, proving the technology and significantly reducing the commercial and financial risks currently associated with it. The Government’s wider policies, as set out in the CCS Roadmap, look beyond the first projects and are designed to build a strong and successful CCS industry. 3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The measures introduced by Government are amongst the most comprehensive anywhere in the world. The Government is also continually engaging with other countries worldwide to promote CCS and learn from their experience. We are also in close dialogue with the industry in the UK to drive forward development and deployment of this technology.  The Government welcomes the Committee’s investigation into Carbon Capture and Storage and the contribution it can make to the Government’s programmes in this area. 4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This is the Government’s evidence to the Energy and Climate Change Committee’s inquiry into Carbon Capture and Storage, following a call for evidence on 17 July 2013. It provides an overview of the key issues and policies; further detail is available in the various reports referenced throughout the text. 5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a chain of technologies designed to remove the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) from power and industrial sources and transport it for safe permanent storage in saline aquifers or depleted oil and gas fields. It is the only technology that has the potential to turn high carbon fuels into genuinely low carbon electricity and to decarbonise many industrial activities. It is a technology that the Government believes could play a significant role in low carbon electricity generation. Many Governments share this view and the UK is regarded as amongst the most supportive internationally.

[[[Figure 1: Simple Carbon Capture and Storage Chain]]]6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; CCS is not a single, specific technology as such, but the term instead covers several types of similar technologies used in each part of the CCS Chain.  The main variations being in the area of capture technologies which can be tailored to suit the application. For example, in the power sector 

[[[post-combustion capture]]] involves the separation of CO2 from the flue gasses produced by the power station. This is the approach proposed at the Peterhead gas CCS project. 7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Another approach is 

[[[Oxyfuel combustion]]] whereby pure oxygen is used in place of air in the combustion process to yield a flue gas of highly concentrated CO2, as is proposed at the White Rose coal project. 8.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Alternatively where Syngas (a mix of hydrogen, CO and CO2) is produced 

[[[pre-combustion capture]]] can remove CO2 to leave a combustible fuel. Finally, concentrated CO2 may be generated as an intrinsic part of the production process, for example in gas processing and in these cases 

[[[inherent separation]]] is used. Further details on the variety of technologies being developed within the CCS industry are available from the Zero Emissions Platform website.9.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Government does not believe that its role is to direct the development of these separate technologies that underpin CCS, and therefore we have adopted a technology neutral approach to CCS with an objective to create an environment which encourages technological development, removes barriers to deployment and encourages development of the industry whilst leaving choices about technologies and projects to industry. This is evidenced in the fact that the Commercialisation Programme has selected two projects showcasing different technologies as preferred bidders.  &#xa0;10.&#xa0; The development of CCS in the UK is likely to contribute to economic growth as well as in the longer term facilitate a competitive energy mix and the cost effective achievement of climate change objectives. 11.&#xa0; We estimate that the deployment of commercial scale CCS projects could sustain 4,000 – 8,000 jobs by 2020 in areas badly in need of growth.  Public investment by the Government through the CCS Commercialisation Programme will lever further private sector investment in these projects.  12.&#xa0; More broadly the availability of CCS to enable commercially deployable low carbon sources of power generation is expected to secure a low-carbon energy mix, and reach our climate change targets in the most efficient manner. The Energy Technologies Institute (ETI) estimate that successfully deploying CCS could cut the annual cost of meeting our carbon targets by £32bn or up to 1% of GDP by 2050. 13.&#xa0; Having a diverse low carbon energy mix, including CCS, has further benefits including enhanced robustness of the electricity system, energy security benefits and increased competition between generators to the benefit of consumers. CCS also offers the potential for flexible generation, especially important in a future low carbon mix dominated by inflexible or intermittent generation, and the opportunity to continue to utilise indigenous fossil fuel resources in the UK. 14.&#xa0; CCS is also the only way for several important industrial sectors such as cement, steel and ceramics to decarbonise and is therefore likely to become critical to their competitiveness as those industries decarbonise. That is why BIS and DECC are working with academics and industry on a technoeconomic study in this important area to inform policy and financing regimes for industrial CCS. 15.&#xa0; There is expected to be a strong global demand for CCS, with the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimating CCS will contribute one sixth of CO2 emission reductions required in 2050. As an early leader, the UK CCS industry could export their expertise worldwide to the benefit of the UK economy. Research in this area noted particular UK expertise in project management, engineering and financial and legal sectors. Further, the Technology Innovation Needs Assessment (TINA) estimated that CCS innovation could help create a UK industry with the potential to contribute further economic value of £3-16bn to 2050.&#xa0;16.&#xa0; CCS could play an important role in avoiding dangerous climate change, especially if it is successfully deployed across the world.   17.&#xa0; Global energy-related CO2 emissions continue to rise. In 2011 they increased by 3.2%, reaching a record high of 31.2 gigatonnes, by far the largest source of global GHG emissions. The continued expansion of fossil fuel generating capacity over recent years, despite strong advances in clean energy technologies worldwide, means that fossil fuels will inevitably play a role in energy generation for many decades to come. 18.&#xa0; CCS offers the potential to reduce the emissions associated with this fossil fuel use. A power plant with CCS could reduce CO2 emissions to the atmosphere by approximately 80-90% compared to an equivalent plant without CCS. The IEA projects that CCS could contribute 14% of the total emission reductions through to 2050 in their 2°C scenario.19.&#xa0; As is the case in the UK, CCS is currently the only large-scale mitigation option that could potentially make deep reductions in global emissions from industrial sectors which represent one-fifth of total global CO2 emissions and which are projected to grow over the coming decades. The IEA estimate that almost half (45%) of the CO2 captured between 2015 and 2050 will need to come from industrial applications and conclude that “Failure to utilize CCS technology in industrial applications poses a significant threat to world capacity to tackle climate change” (IEA 2013 p8). 20.&#xa0; As long as fossil fuels and carbon-intensive industries play dominant roles in the global economy, CCS will be a critical carbon abatement technology. It is also a cost effective solution, the IEA estimates that without CCS the cost of meeting a 50% global reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050 will be 70% higher. Investing in CCS research, development and innovation now will play an important role in reducing the costs of CCS around the world by developing cheaper and more efficient technologies and components, and contributing to characterising storage sites.21.&#xa0; The benefits of CCS are therefore significant, not just for the UK but for also for wider global efforts to prevent dangerous climate change. However, there are a number of barriers which have prevented widespread private sector deployment of the technology to date. 22.&#xa0; The individual components of the CCS chain use established technologies. For example there is in excess of 6,000km of onshore CO2 pipelines in the USA and CO2 has also been safely transported to stores offshore in Norway, with over 1MtCO2 stored per annum in Sleipner. There is, however, limited experience in full-chain CCS projects as there are no large scale integrated CCS projects on power stations operational to date (although some are in advanced stages of construction). 23.&#xa0; Integration of the full chain at commercial scale presents both technical and commercial challenges. For example, scaling up CO2 capture technology; the technical and commercial risks with the characterisation and proving of CO2 stores; and commercial risks around novel business structures. 24.&#xa0; The novelty of integration and scaling up means that first-of-a-kind full chain CCS projects face significant barriers to investment and CCS is not yet cost-competitive with other low carbon technologies. Initial projects have higher capture costs and energy penalties. Building the first transportation infrastructure and proving the first CO2 stores is capital intensive. 25.&#xa0; Because CCS is not an established technology the current banking and private finance climate also presents some additional challenges. It can be more difficult to secure finance for new projects such as CCS than in the past, or where finance is provided it can be associated with higher costs of capital. 26.&#xa0; A strong carbon price should help strengthen the business case for CCS and counter the additional costs associated with the technology, however, the current price as seen in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) is not sufficient by itself to drive CCS adoption. 27.&#xa0; The UK Government has therefore designed its CCS policy to address these barriers. 28.&#xa0; The Government has worked extensively to understand the barriers to deployment of the technology. Our assessment is that to be deployable on a scale necessary to contribute to the UK’s low carbon agenda CCS must be:29.&#xa0; Based on this we have developed a comprehensive package of measures to bring forward the very first commercial scale CCS projects in the UK through our Commercialisation Programme, and also reduce or remove the barriers that stop projects coming forward independently.30.&#xa0; In April 2012 the Government published the first UK CCS Roadmap setting out a comprehensive package to take us to cost competitive CCS in the 2020s. This submission does not attempt to cover the complete breath of measures set out in the Roadmap, full details of which are available in the report on the Department’s website.    31.&#xa0; The five key components outlined in the Roadmap are: 32.&#xa0; The CCS Commercialisation Programme aims to support practical experience in the design, construction and operation of commercial scale Carbon Capture and Storage. By demonstrating the technology at scale, and the successful operation of the CCS chain both technically and commercially, the Competition will go some way in addressing many of the barriers currently hindering independent project development. 33.&#xa0; The Government has committed to making £1bn capital funding available for up to two projects, and uniquely the UK is also providing operational support to projects through low-carbon Contracts for Difference.  34.&#xa0; The Competition was launched alongside the Roadmap in April 2012 and attracted significant interest from industry, with eight bids submitted when the competition closed on 3 July 2012.  Following detailed analysis, four bids were taken forward into a bid improvement phase in late 2012. From this group, two Preferred Bidders were announced as part of Budget 2013, with the other two bidders being assigned Reserve Bidder status. 35.&#xa0; The proposals put forward by bidders that have been designated as Preferred Bids are: 36.&#xa0; The proposals put forward by bidders that have been designated as Reserve Bids are:37.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; DECC is currently negotiating contracts with preferred bidders to agree the level of public support required for these projects to proceed. Initially these negotiations are focussed on the Front End Engineering and Design (FEED) studies. Reserve Bidders may be called to participate in the next stage of the competition if one or both of the Preferred Bidders fails to enter into a FEED Contract.38.&#xa0; These FEED studies are invaluable not just for providing technical and economic certainty for the projects involved, but also for the detailed information they provide to wider industry and academics through our dissemination programme. Previous FEED studies have been made freely available through the Government’s Knowledge Transfer programme and have been a valuable addition to the body of knowledge on the subject.39.&#xa0; Bringing forward these large infrastructure projects is a complex process, requiring development of innovative solutions to issues that have prevented widespread deployment to date. The FEED studies will inform final investment decisions, expected to take place in 2015.40.&#xa0; The White Rose project has also been put forward for funding through the European Commission’s NER300 second call, the only CCS project in Europe to do so. The NER300 is a mechanism to finance commercial-scale CCS and innovative renewable projects from the sale of 300m EU ETS allowances over two rounds. Award decisions are expected by June 2014.41.&#xa0; These projects, and the ones that follow, will be able to benefit from the Government’s development of a new market for low carbon electricity through the Electricity Market Reform (EMR) programme. Far-reaching reform of the UK electricity market is needed to meet our renewables and carbon targets while maintaining security of supply and minimising consumer bills.42.&#xa0; EMR is a central component of the Energy Bill currently being considered by Parliament, and will address the need to attract unprecedented levels of investment in the UK electricity sector over the coming decades as we replace our ageing energy infrastructure with a diverse mix of low-carbon generation, and meet the expected increases in electricity demand as sectors such as transport and heat are electrified.43.&#xa0; Contracts for Difference (CfDs) will provide efficient long term support for all forms of low carbon generation – including CCS. They will provide the certainty investors and developers need to proceed with projects. The UK is unique worldwide in planning to provide on-going financial support through CfDs for CCS projects, providing a route to market for projects and strengthening business cases.44.&#xa0; During the summer we published a suite of documents on EMR for consultation. These provide key detail on the policy proposals including draft terms of contracts and are available on the DECC website. These reforms will provide certainty, as well as financial support, for the long term development of CCS in the UK. 45.&#xa0; The UK has a world-class CCS research base and the Government is committed to supporting this work.   46.&#xa0; Across the current spending review, we are delivering a £125m CCS Research and Development programme with our funding partners (the Research Councils, Technology Strategy Board and Energy Technologies Institute) to support:47.&#xa0; In total, around 100 separate projects are being funded through this programme. A full list of these can be found on our project diagram (and database), available from our website.48.&#xa0; The Government has also supported the establishment of the UK CCS Research Centre (UKCCSRC) – a c.£13 million investment which brings together the UK’s top CCS academics to promote and coordinate UK CCS research capability, and increase academic collaboration with industry. 49.&#xa0; The UK has led the world in the development of a regulatory framework to facilitate CCS. The Government undertook a comprehensive review of the regulation necessary to enable CCS in 2007 and has quickly addressed barriers when they are identified. For example, adding powers to the Energy Act 2011 to address a barrier to the reuse of existing capital assets for the purpose of CO2 storage and transport. 50.&#xa0; It is essential that the CCS industry has the right skills and supply chain it needs to develop. Therefore the Government is engaging with manufacturers’ organisations, such as EEF and other partners, to ensure UK companies are aware of the potential supply chain opportunities from the Commercialisation Programme, and beyond. 51.&#xa0; The Government also recognises the importance of long term regulatory and price signals for investor certainty. For this reason we have brought forward a ‘triple lock’ of policies designed to encourage deployment of CCS. These are (i) the National Policy Statement for Energy’s Carbon Capture Readiness requirements, and stipulation that there should be no new coal power plants over 300MW built without CCS; (ii) the Carbon Price Floor which gives an economic incentive to reduce emissions from fossil fuelled power stations; and (iii) the Emissions Performance Standard which provides a regulatory backstop to the requirement of no new coal without CCS.52.&#xa0; CCS projects in the UK will be regulated by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE).  53.&#xa0; HSE believes that existing legislation will allow for effective inspection and enforcement of health and safety standards associated with CCS projects. The Pipelines Safety Regulations 1996 also imposes general duties on all pipeline operators, including appropriate design, safety systems, maintenance, suitability to convey fluids, construction and installation, and prevention of accidental damage. 54.&#xa0; At onshore CO2 capture sites the co-location of qualifying amounts of substances will mean that operators will be required to produce a safety case under the permissioning regime set out in the Control of Major Accident Hazards Regulations 1999 (COMAH). The COMAH Regulations are enforced by a body called the COMAH Competent Authority, which brings together the relevant government bodies of Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and Environment Agency (EA) in England and Wales, and the HSE and Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) in Scotland.55.&#xa0; HSE has held direct meetings with each of the Commercialisation Programme bidders to discuss suitable and proportionate process safety based approaches to their projects. In particular, the capture and offshore injection and storage stages will follow the same process design and safety principles that are already well established at onshore major establishments and offshore oil and gas installations.56.&#xa0; Detailed CO2-specific standards are under development relating to pipeline transport and design assumptions are being empirically tested in trials. Progress is also being made by the Health and Safety Laboratory and others in the modelling of CO2 dispersion in the event of a large-scale release.  This work has informed discussions between HSE and the potential Commercialisation Programme projects. 57.&#xa0; The Government is continually engaging with industry to identify the issues which may constrain CCS deployment and work to develop solutions. For example, recognising the concerns about costs, we convened a CCS Cost Reduction Task Force tasked with investigating the potential for cost reduction and recommending actions to secure these cost reductions.58.&#xa0; The Task Force concluded that UK gas and coal power stations equipped with carbon capture, transport and storage have clear potential to be cost competitive with other forms of low-carbon power generation, delivering electricity at a levelised cost approaching £100/MWh by the early 2020s. In its Final Report, the Task Force also provided recommendations for both industry and Government on actions that could be taken to help secure the cost reductions identified. These are being taken forward by the newly established Storage Development Group, Commercial Development Group, Knowledge Transfer Network and through DECC’s wider CCS Programme.  59.&#xa0; The IEA forecasts that CCS could contribute 14% of the total emission reductions through to 2050 in their 2°C scenario, and that without CCS the cost of meeting a 50% global reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050 will be 70% higher.60.&#xa0; Norway, the Netherlands, the US, Canada and Australia are amongst the leading CCS countries. These countries incentivise CCS with a combination of policies and financial support. In total these countries have provided $5.6bn in support for their CCS projects. However, the current main difference between CCS projects in the UK and North America is that the latter intend to use the captured CO2 for onshore Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). This allows them to generate additional income that offsets capital and operating costs, for example at Boundary Dam in Canada and Kemper County in the US. 61.&#xa0; Bringing forward the first commercial scale CCS projects is a challenge. This is evidenced by the experience across Europe, where 8 projects have been delayed or abandoned since 2010. This despite CCS being a central part of the EU’s energy and climate policy and introduction of a CCS Directive covering both regulatory issues and funding regimes through the EEPR and the New Entrant Reserve 300 (NER300).  62.&#xa0; The Government is also engaging through regional, bilateral and multilateral relationships to collaborate and help overcome the challenges of commercial-scale CCS deployment.  We participate in a number of bilateral relationships as well as through international fora such as the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum, the North Sea Basin Task Force, the Clean Energy Ministerial and the 4 Kingdoms CCS Initiative, working with countries facing similar challenges to CCS deployment to address policy specific questions around CCS financing and capacity-building.

[[[CCS in a low carbon energy mix]]] 63.&#xa0; The Government believes CCS could play a significant role in our future low carbon energy mix, and also in the global effort to reduce emissions and prevent dangerous climate change. Our policies are designed to give CCS the best possible opportunity to develop in the UK, with comprehensive financial and regulatory support as set out above. Our modeling suggests up to 12GW could be deployed by 2030 and 40GW by 2050.64.&#xa0; Developing commercial Carbon Capture and Storage is an important part of the Government’s strategy for decarbonising the power sector in line with the 2050 target at lowest cost. While our energy policies have been designed to bring forward all forms of low carbon electricity so that that we are not dependent on any one technology, if CCS is not successfully deployed there will be greater reliance on other low carbon technologies which would impose greater cost and risks in achieving decarbonisation.   65.&#xa0; This memorandum has set out the importance the Government attaches to CCS, the barriers to development of projects, and the extensive package of measures being introduced to drive deployment of CCS.
