defaultIntroductiondefault&#xa0;
defaultI am currently an employee of Abu Dhabi Police (ADP), working as a Strategic Advisor in the UAE National DNA Database Centre in Al-Ain, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Prior to my current employment, I worked for the FSS, previously the Metropolitan Police Forensic Science Laboratory (MPFSL), for nearly 20 years. As a result of the winding down of the FSS, I was made redundant on the 31 May 2011.
default&#xa0;
defaultOver the course of my forensic career I have examined hundreds of body fluids cases, carried out several generations of DNA profiling techniques (SLP, SGM and SGM Plus), reported simple DNA cases in the UK, and carried out complex paternity analysis of DNA cases to help identify Kuwaiti Nationals exiled during the first Gulf War.
default&#xa0;
defaultI managed a team of DNA analysts in the FSS London DNA Unit for a number of years, and was then seconded to a special projects team where I was responsible for implementing the UK National Firearms Forensic Intelligence Database (NFFID) which was the precursor of the current National Ballistics Intelligence Service (NABIS).
default&#xa0;
defaultDuring the second half of my forensic career I have provided consultancy and assistance to overseas governments as a member of the FSS International Division. During this time I delivered forensic laboratory improvement projects in Kuwait, Trinidad and Abu Dhabi. The three year project in Abu Dhabi culminated in UKAS granting ISO 17025 accreditation to the Abu Dhabi Police Forensic Evidence Department in 2009.
