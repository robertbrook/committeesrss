[normal]Written Evidence [bold]from[bold] Professor Ian Cram, School of Law, Leeds University[bold] (CRJ 05)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]EXECUTIVE SUMMARY[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]This submission considers some of the implications of constitutional codification that might follow from the adoption of a ‘Bill of Rights’ as part of any new constitutional settlement. As such the submission primarily addresses points 1,3,4 &amp; 6 listed in the Select Committee’s terms of reference (whilst accepting that a codified constitution must of necessity set out institutional powers and relationships that raises issues well beyond rights claims by individuals). Specifically, the submission

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.[bold] [bold]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]“a bill of rights is what the people are entitled to against every government on earth, general or particular, &amp; what no just government should refuse, or rest on inference.’ Thomas Jefferson (
[normal]Letter to James Madison 
[normal]1787)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. We live in an epoch of constitution-making. A recent survey of the world’s constitutions suggested that approximately 25% of the world’s constitutions have been drafted and adopted since 1974. Such is the universal status of human rights discourse, that it is virtually unthinkable 
[normal]that the promulgation of a new constitution in the twenty-first century would not contain, as one of its component elements, a statement somewhere of the rights of the people and refer directly or impliedly to human rights standards prevailing in the international community. Events such as the collapse of former communist-bloc countries in Eastern Europe, demilitarised states in Greece Portugal and Spain in western Europe (and elsewhere) and the post-colonial/apartheid emergence of states in Africa and elsewhere have generated new constitutional settlements that have featured at their respective cores bills of rights, guaranteeing a varying degree of rights and freedoms. Moreover (and unlike the constitutional documents that Jefferson was familiar with) a modern constitution would be expected to state with some degree of precision the remedies available to an injured party and the procedures by which these remedies might be enforced.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. The survey conducted by Elkins et al of the constitutional features of 186 national constitutions reveals an interesting correlation.
[normal] From a total of 117 different rights enshrined in these constitutions, the newer constitutions were more likely to contain a higher total of rights than their more venerable counterparts. Thus the Constitutions of Angola (2010); Bolivia (2009) and Ecuador (2008) set out respectively express protection for 79, 88 &amp; 86 different rights, whilst the Constitutions of United States (1789); Norway (1814) and Belgium (1831) by contrast manage reference to 35, 14 and 34 different rights. This pattern might be explained by the expansion of the ‘human rights catalogue’ from an initial (typically Western) position in which a limited set of negative civil/political rights against the state are conceded (requiring in the main no positive actions or commitment of resources by the state) to a much broader set of socio-economic rights claims such as rights to healthcare, education, housing (requiring state actions and economic resources and so-called third generation rights to the protection of the environment and cultural aspects of community life.  (A counter example of a modern constitution containing a relatively modest total of individual rights is provided by Myanmar (2008) with protection for just 38 different rights).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. Interestingly, even within ‘Westminster-style’ constitutions that draw heavily upon notions of responsible government and parliamentary supremacy, ‘bills of rights’ have nonetheless become more prominent in New Zealand, the UK, the Australian state of Victoria and Australian Capital Territory and signal new relationships not only between the individual and the state but also inter-institutionally between the executive, legislature and judiciary. Canada’s departure from the Westminster model in 1982 is worth highlighting.
[normal] 
[normal]The Constitution Act of that year signalled the end of the UK Parliament’s powers to legislate for Canada and included the Canadian Charter of Rights that  formally authorised judicial review of primary legislation enacted by federal and state 
[normal]legislatures, albeit with an express power of legislative override in s.33 of the Charter in respect of judicial rulings on ‘fundamental’ rights (s.2) and ‘legal’ and ‘equality’ rights (ss.7-15).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. In seeking to draw instructive lessons from the experiences of other countries, it is right however to remember that the structure and content of national constitutions will inevitably reflect an interactive set of historical, economic, political and cultural influences that are unique to that state.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.   1
[normal]. Current role of the judiciary in UK generally and under (i) Human Rights Act and (ii) European Communities Act
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The current role of the UK judiciary is to interpret the law in accordance in accordance with accepted canons of statutory interpretation. Outside of EU law (see below), the judges do not enjoy a power to ‘strike-down’, ‘disapply’ or invalidate an Act of Parliament. The law is what the latest Act of Parliament says it is. In respect of human rights protected under Section 1 of the Human Rights Act 1998, the Act is generally considered to allow judges greater leeway to strain parliamentary language to secure a European Convention-compatible reading of a domestic statute than would be permitted under the usual canons of statutory interpretation. The 1998 Act does not allow the courts to disapply a domestic statute where a Convention-compatible reading is not possible. In this sense parliamentary supremacy is preserved. A non-binding declaration of incompatibility may be issued by the court in such cases. However, this does not affect the outcome of the case. Instead, such a declaration may serve as a prompt to the political part of the Constitution - Parliament and the Executive - to consider arguments for reform of the rights-infringing statute. The combined effect of ss.3 &amp; 4 of the 1998 Act is commonly said to have generated a ‘dialogic’ approach to human rights protection in which the judges participate in a ‘conversation’ with the elected spheres of the Constitution about the extent of citizens’ human rights protections. Ultimately, the dominant position of the Executive within the UK Legislature means that the Government has the final say.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As regards EU law, the decision of the House of Lords in 
[normal]ex parte Factortame 
[normal]No2
[normal] revealed that the UK Parliament is no longer sovereign in respect of matters governed by EU law. Where EU law confers directly enforceable rights, these may enforced in the UK courts even if this means suspending or disapplying an Act of the UK Parliament. In 
[normal]Factortame
[normal] No2 discriminatory 
[normal]provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 were set aside by the House of Lords upon a challenge by a Spanish-owned fishing company.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.   [bold]1. &amp; 3. [bold]If the UK were to move to a codified constitution, the new constitutional role of the judges under that codified constitution would depend upon the status of the provisions contained within the Constitution and the function accorded to the judges in that Constitution. It is possible to conceive of a form of constitutional codification in which the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty is affirmed and the judges’ role is not expanded to encompass judicial review of all primary legislation. In this scenario, some version of ‘dialogic’ rights protection continues. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8. Alternatively, it is possible as the example of Canada suggests, for the contents of a newly codified Constitution to assume a higher (or ‘entrenched’ or ‘supreme’) status and for the senior courts to be expressly empowered to give remedies to the victims of rights’ violations.
[normal] In such circumstances, the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty would no longer prevail. Although it is worth pointing out following the ruling of the House of Lords in 
[normal]AG v Jackson
[normal] that there is a view among some senior judicial figures (past and present) that Dicey’s theory of the unlimited sovereignty of Parliament is no longer tenable. Two main arguments here are as follows: 
[normal](i) Under theories of ‘common law constitutionalism’ the judges have never relinquished their power to invalidate certain types of legislation. In 
[normal]Jackson
[normal] Lord Steyn referred to an ‘exceptional’ scenario in which Parliament was attempting to abolish judicial review or the ordinary role of the courts. Here, he argued, the Supreme Court would have to consider whether such an alteration of a constitutional fundamental was beyond the power of a sovereign Parliament.
[normal] Likewise, Lord Hope declared that the principle of parliamentary sovereignty was a creation of the common law and ’built upon the assumption that Parliament represents the people whom it exists to serve.’
[normal] 
[normal]Where the legislature no longer represents the people and loses the trust of the people, the implication of Lord Hope’s position is that the judges might refuse to recognise an Act of Parliament.  
[normal]Baroness Hale for her part stated that the courts 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]‘will treat with particular suspicion(and might even reject) any attempt to subvert the rule 
[normal]of law by removing government action affecting the rights of the individual from all 
[normal]judicial scrutiny.’
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](ii) Modification of the doctrine of implied repeal - there is view among some (including Laws LJ in 
[normal]Thoburn
[normal]) that, in respect of ‘constitutional’ statutes, the doctrine of implied repeal is no longer operative. That is to say, a later Parliament wishing to repeal the provisions of a constitutional statute must do so in express terms in the later, amending legislation. This claim assumes of course that there is general agreement on what counts as a ‘constitutional’ statute.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.  
[normal]3(b) - interaction between UK courts and European Court on Human Rights 
[normal]Current interactions are undoubtedly strained. As the debates around the time of the Brighton Declaration in April 2012 show, the UK Government (or at least the Conservative component of the Government) and a significant section of parliamentary opinion has been concerned that European Court of Human Rights rulings on UK authorities’ rulings on prisoners’ voting rights (such as 
[normal]Hirst
[normal] No2) and deportation of foreign terrorist suspects (eg 
[normal]Abu Qatada
[normal]) represent an unduly interventionist approach that limits the ability of UK authorities to act in ways that the latter consider reflect public opinion and/or safeguard national security. This explains both (i) the push by the UK to secure greater recognition of the principle of subsidiarity in the Strasbourg Court’s rulings; and (ii) the desire in some quarters for a new British Bill of Rights that would strike a different balance between individual rights and competing interests such as public safety and national security. In those instances where the Strasbourg Court applies a lighter touch form of supra-national rights review, this may go some way to meet some of  the Court’s critics here in the UK. There is also a separate concern voiced by among others Lord Hoffman
[normal] that some judges on the Strasbourg Court may struggle to understand aspects of UK law. Significantly in 
[normal]R v Horncastle and others
[normal] a unanimous Supreme Court declined to follow the decision of the Fourth Section of the European Court of Human Rights in 
[normal]Al-Khawaja and Tahery v UK
[normal].
[normal] Lord Phillips, the President of the Court, noted that the requirement in s.2 of the Human Rights Act to ‘take into account’ Strasbourg jurisprudence but added that there would be ‘rare’ occasions when this court 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]has concerns as to whether a decision of the Strasbourg Court sufficiently appreciates 
[normal]or accommodates particular aspects of our domestic process. In such circumstances it 
[normal]is open to this court to decline to follow the Strasbourg decision...’
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Whether or not a codified constitution containing a Bill of Rights was enacted in the UK, tensions in the relationship between the Strasbourg Court and the UK authorities are likely to remain as long as the UK remains a member of the Council of Europe and allows individuals to take a complaint to Strasbourg. Notwithstanding 
[normal]Horncastle
[normal], we continue to be bound (as far as international law is concerned) to give effect to the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. Failure to implement a ruling of the European Court of Human Rights would probably lead to adverse political consequences for the UK in a range of international fora, especially at Council of Europe and EU fora. A decision to cease membership of the Council of Europe is virtually unimaginable.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10. 
[normal]4) Pre enactment judicial scrutiny of Bills under a codified Constitution  - pros &amp; cons
[normal]There is a mechanism in the Scotland Act 1998 that empowers the Attorney General  to refer a Bill (or provision of a Bill) that is before the devolved Scottish Parliament to the UK Supreme Court in order to ascertain whether the measure is within the legislative competence of the Holyrood Parliament.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11.If a decision was taken to give entrenched status to a newly codified constitution in which the judiciary was to have the final say on the constitutionality of primary legislation, then a form of pre-enactment judicial scrutiny at Bill stage might seem logical, if only to avert subsequent expensive and protracted litigation and, in the event of a successful post-enactment legal challenge, time-consuming legislative reform. What proportion of post-enactment challenges would be headed off by a system of pre-enactment scrutiny is not knowable. The Scottish experience is relevant here. Since the Scotland Act 1998 came into force, there is no single reported instance of a referral to the Supreme Court. It may be speculated that the distinction between reserved and non-reserved matters has been expressed with such clarity in the 1998 Act that there is little scope for disagreement on what is within/outside the competence of the Scottish Parliament. As to what might happen in the UK under a codified constitution, much would hinge on the design of any pre-enactment clause. For example who would have the power of referral? Would it be confined to Law Officers or might Members of Parliament and/or Select Committees be able to refer matters (in Germany one third of MPs may request an advisory/pre-enactment review)? If not, might MPs/HL members be able to seek judicial review in respect of a decision of a senior Law Officer not to refer? What about persons outside Parliament/Executive? Could individuals/NGOs/corporate entities/trades unions seek referrals if they were likely to be affected by the proposed legislation? In respect of which matters would the power to refer lie? 
[normal]How soon after the publication of a Bill would a referral have to be made? Would referrals go directly to the Supreme Court? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12.Pre-enactment scrutiny in the courts might contribute to a process whereby parliamentary debate on the best legislative policy is overshadowed and inhibited by the prospect of pre-enactment review. Both pre-enactment and post enactment judicial review arguably encourage legislative policy positions that are ‘fire-proofed’ against judicial reverse.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13. Pre-enactment scrutiny has obvious similarities with the concept of an advisory opinion that is known in some jurisdictions such as Canada, Germany and England (in the guise of a declaration).It has been constitutionally prohibited in the United States on separation of powers grounds since Chief Justice John Jay refused to give President Washington the benefit of the Supreme Court’s opinion on the constitutionality of American neutrality in the war between Great Britain and France in the 1790s. In the UK, the remedy known as a ‘declaration’ can be used to obtain authoritative judicial guidance in the absence of any actual legal dispute. This has been used when an apparently hypothetical question is likely to become a concrete legal dispute in the near future.
[normal] There is however an understandable caution on the part of English judges to issue advisory declarations too freely. Thus, they have refused to use this power where complex factual situations can be foreseen but have yet to materialise.
[normal] This consideration however would not apply to pre-enactment scrutiny of bills.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14. At present the Joint Committee on Human Rights provides an informed analysis of the human rights implications of legislative proposals. This advice may not always be listened to by the Government
[normal] but it serves (and is perceived to serve) as a valuable means of pre-legislative scrutiny. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15. 6 
[normal]Instructive lessons from common law jurisdictions and written constitutions
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is evident from recent developments at state level in Australia where two jurisdictions (Australian Capital Territory, Victoria) have adopted statutory Bills of Rights (which mirror key aspects of our own HRA) that the 
[normal]process 
[normal]leading up to the adoption of a Bill of Rights is almost as important as the Bill’s contents - at least in terms of securing the legitimacy of the Bill in the eyes of ordinary citizens. Any attempt to codify the UK Constitution would require extensive and  
[normal]localised consultations that would do well to look at the experiences of consultation exercises at state and territory level in Australia. In any event, it would be vital that social media platforms play a major part in any such process.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]16. At federal level, despite the Labor Party being more sympathetic to the idea, majoritarian conceptions of democracy and a confidence in the idea of responsible government have thus far prevailed. Former PM John Howard dismissed the idea of a federal Bill of Rights as the’ triumph of elitism’ and premised on distrust of elected MPs and Senators.
[normal] Given the recent electoral success of the Australian Liberal Party, it is likely that the campaign for a federal Bill of Rights will stall. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17. At state level the Victorian Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006 is noteworthy on several counts. Like the UK’s HRA, the 2006 Act stops short of authorising judicial review over primary legislation. The Victorian Supreme Court may issue a ‘declaration of inconsistency’ much like our own s.4 HRA declaration.
[normal]  The Minister sponsoring the statute in question then has six months to prepare a response to the declaration and lay this before each House of Parliament.
[normal] Significantly however (and unlike our HRA), the Victorian Parliament can issue a 
[normal]prospective 
[normal]override declaration during the parliamentary passage of legislation in respect of the whole Bill or a provision of the Bill with the result that, upon enactment, the courts cannot subsequently issue a declaration of inconsistency.
[normal] The override expires five years after the provision comes into force although the override may be re-enacted by Parliament.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]18. In New Zealand, the Labor Govt proposed an entrenched Bill of Rights in 1985 largely on the basis that the dominant position of the governing party in a unicameral legislature might risk the gradual erosion of individual liberties. However in the consultation exercise which followed, the vast majority of consultees expressed concern at the transfer of powers away from politicians and towards the judges. The Canadian version of rights review by the courts was deemed to give the judges too much power.  A statutory Bill of Rights followed in 1990 (NZBORA) which is not entrenched and is liable to be modified by subsequent Acts of the NZ Parliament under both express and implied repeal. NZBORA does not even suffice to impliedly repeal pre-1990 NZBORA-inconsistent legislation. The main rights-protecting achievement of NZBORA is that 
[normal]whenever a statute can be given a meaning that NZBORA consistent, the judges must prefer this meaning to a rival, NZBORA-inconsistent meaning.

[normal]Jefferson made this claim on learning that the draft Constitution emerging from the Philadelphia Convention had omitted any reference to a set of express guarantees for individual freedoms against the federal government. Jefferson was perhaps reflecting his own Virginian background. In 1776, Virginians had led the way among states in drafting a written constitution at whose head stood a declaration of rights.
