default1.1 
defaultThe 
defaultCrown Estate welcomes the
default 
defaultopportunity to respond to 
defaultt
defaulthe Scottish Affairs Committee’s consultation on land reform in Scotland. 
default&#xa0;
default1.2 
defaultAs a landowner and as the manager of a diverse portfolio 
defaultacross the UK
default, our experience enables us to offer insights which may help to inform the debate.
default We responded to the Scottish Government’s Land Reform Review Group Call for Evidence in January 2013
default and met with the Group in September 2013.
default&#xa0;
default1.3 
defaultIt would no
defaultt be appropriate for us to take a political view on the 
defaultwide ranging
default public policy 
defaultissues 
defaultoutlined in the Terms of Reference and 
defaultdiscussed in the briefing paper “
default432:50 – Towards a comprehensive land reform agenda for Scotland
default”, but we hope that the commen
defaultts below are useful in informing the Committee’s deliberations.
default&#xa0;
default1.4 
defaultIt is important to note that th
defaultis submission is written in the context of 
defaultThe Government response to the seventh report of the Scottish Affairs Committee session 2010-12 on The Crown 
defaultEstate in Scotland
default,
default i
defaultn 
defaultwhich
default the UK Government rejected 
defaultrecommendations
default to devolve The Crown Estate 
defaultassets.
default 
default&#xa0;
default2. defaultAbout The Crown Estate in Scotlanddefault&#xa0;default2.1 
defaultThe Crown Estate is committed to Scotland. Our annual reports illustrate how we 
defaultwork with stakeholders
default and how we leverage expertise and investment from our UK-wide business to support key sectors in Scotland.
default2.2 
defaultOur remit is to maintain and enhance the value of 
defaultour 
defaultassets over the long-term while delivering a return to government, and to do so with due 
defaultregard to good management. This means that, in managing assets commercially, we consider how our investments and developments may deliver real benefits to communities, to Scotland and to the UK generally.
default2.3 
defaultIn fulfilling this role, our team in Scotland a
defaultnd London work to enable and facilitate sustainable economic development.
default2.4 
defaultIn mature sectors
default,
default such as tourism and aquaculture, we invest in
default, 
defaultand secure investment in
default, 
defaultspecific projects (e.g. marine leisure developments). We also work with industry, loca
defaultl authorities and agencies such as Highlands &amp; Islands Enterprise (HIE), to ensure a coordinated and collaborative approach at local, regional and national level.
default2.5 
defaultIn emerging sectors such as offshore 
defaultrenewables
default and carbon capture &amp; storage (CCS), we co
defaultordinate a range of strategic activity designed to accelerate development and de-risk investment. We work closely with organisations such as Marine Scotland, Scottish Enterprise and local authorities, in addition to 
defaultdevelopers and 
defaultenergy companies, to help
default establish this sector within the UK’s energy mix.
default&#xa0;
default2.6 
defaultThe Crown Estate’s 
defaultholdings in Scotland comprise:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.7 
defaultIn 
default2012/13
default,
default o
defaultur gross surplus in Scotland was £11.6 million
default, four per cent of the
default £283.2 million 
defaulttotal 
defaultfor the UK as a wh
defaultole. 
defaultAll net surplus is returned to the Treasury for public spending. 
default&#xa0;
default2.8 
defaultOur 
defaultnet investme
defaultnt in Scotland in 2012/13 was
default £4.4 million
default, and from
default 2010/11 to 2012/13 it totalled 
default£11.3 million.
default&#xa0;
default3. defaultThedefault land reform agendadefault&#xa0;
default3.1 
defaultWhile we acknowledge the 
defaultsuccess of the community land ownership initiatives which have taken place in Scotland, 
defaultour experience indicates that many of the benefits that could accrue can also be achieved by other mechanisms which enhance the opportunities for tenants an
defaultd communitie
defaults to shape how land 
defaultis managed. 
default&#xa0;
default3.2 
defaultIn this respect
default,
default the
default Committee’s
default 
defaultbriefing 
defaultpaper
default largely confines 
defaultconsideration of 
defaultland reform to the transfer of ownership. While there may be merits to this in many cases
default,
default it is equally true that many tenant farmers d
defaulto not find ownership attractive. Indeed, the STFA survey referred to in the report states 
defaultthat 
default80% of respondents believed rural communities would benefit from ‘greater diversity of ownership’ rather than simply land transfer. 
default&#xa0;
default3.3 
defaultThe Crown Estate works 
defaultin close partnership with communities (through development trusts, liaison groups etc.
default,) in a way that empowers them 
defaultwithout them having to take on the liabilities
default 
defaultassociated with ownership. The 
defaultScotland’s
default Rural College 
defaultmakes this point i
defaultn their respons
defaulte 
defaultto the Scottish Government’s Land Reform R
defaulteview
default Group
default:
default&#xa0;
default3.4 
default"While there are many examples of successful community landowners in the Highlands and Islands, 
defaultit is not a panacea and success is never easy, requiring a great deal of
default sustained effort by all sta
defaultkeholders. There are instances where close partnership working between landowners and rural 
defaultcommunities brings significant mutual benefits, and avoids the responsibilities and costs for communities of owning the land."
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.5 
defaultThis is echoed in a report for 
defaultthe Big Lottery, Growing Community Assets Evaluation (Final Year Report).
default 
default SCDI, in their response 
defaultto
default the Scottish 
defaultGovernment’s
default Land R
defaulte
defaultf
defaultorm Re
defaultview Group, 
defaultindicate the relative importance of factors other than land 
defaultownership
default:
default&#xa0;
default3.6 
default“
defaultSCDI understands that, 
defaultin some cases, ownership of land is a central factor in economic growth, particularly where an owner is a barrier to development or fails to maintain their land holding. SCDI recognises the benefits that community ownership can have on fragile communities 
defaultas has been demonstrated with both 
defaultGigha
default and 
defaultEigg
default. However; in most cases the ownership of land is secondary to the impact of factors such as the economic climate, government legislative measures, taxation or other policy leavers, and the lack of discussio
defaultn over land use
default.”
default3.7 
defaultFor this reason
default it will be just as important to ensure that estates pursue good practice i
defaultn terms of both integrated land-use and 
defaultgiving tenants and communities a stake in their 
defaultland
default, within the broader context of sustainable economi
defaultc development
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default4. defaultOur work with rural &amp; coastal communitiesdefault&#xa0;
default4.1 
defaultFrom the perspective of The Crown Estate, there are three strands of our work which 
defaultrelate to issues raised in the Committee’s briefing paper.
default These include:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default4.2 
defaultWe would suggest that some of the ways in which we
default defaultenable tenants and communities to manage land and foreshore across 
defaultour 
defaultrural and coastal estates may offer models for other landowners. 
default&#xa0;default4.3 
defaultThese range from structuring leases to meet the stated desire of a community for direct management and control, supporting locally-run organisations to manage assets, a
defaultnd our 
defaultLocal Management Agreements
default,
default an 
defaultinitiative
default 
defaultintroduced in 2012 following the C
defaultommittee’s
default inquiry into The Crown Estate. LMAs
default empower communities to manage areas of the foreshore.
default 
defaultBelow we provide examples and 
defaultoutline
default the benefits that these initiatives have delivered. 
default&#xa0;
default4.4 defaultLocal Management Agreements (LMAdefaultsdefault)default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.5 
defaultWe 
defaultare seeking
default further LMA proposals from communities in Scotland and other parts of the UK
default, and have been working
default to raise awareness through media, our own publications and website, and through relevant member organisations such as Development Trust Association Scotland.
default&#xa0;
default4.6 
defaultOur programme of LMA publicity includes:

defaultLMAs
default can be customised to meet the needs/aspirations of
default individual communities. The projects should be led and driven by local organisations, and have broad buy-in from the community. This will help ensure that they are sustainable in the long-term and that they result in genuine devolution of the management o
defaultf assets.

defaultThe briefing paper references progress (or lack of) following the Committee’s inquiry into The Crown Estate. 
default&#xa0;
default5.2 
defaultOn request of the Committee, we recently submitted written evidence outlining how we have responded to the Inquiry, the report of which was published in March 2012. This is included in Appendix 1 and details progress in a range of areas such as stakeholder engagement, accountability and transparency, and how or activity generates benefits for communities.
default&#xa0;default6. Conclusiondefault&#xa0;
default6.1 We believe that our approach to working with both rural and coastal communities reflects good practice in a way that does not necessarily rely on the transfer of land. This includes:
default&#xa0;
defaultAppendix 1defaultUpdate from The Crown Estate to the Scottish Affairs Committeedefault&#xa0;defaultIntroductiondefaultWe welcome the opportunity to update the Committee on the progress made in response to the conclusions and recommendations of your inquiry into The Crown Estate, the report of which was published on 19 March 2012. 
defaultSome of the recommendations are matters for Government rather than The Crown Estate, including the recommendation on devolution of The Crown Estate. The UK Government responded to the Scottish Affairs Committee’s (SAC) Report in July 2012.  
defaultThis response outlines how we have worked to address the general conclusions in the Report and the specific recommendations that were accepted by the UK Government as actions for The Crown Estate.
default&#xa0;defaultThe Crown Estate in ScotlanddefaultThe Crown Estate is committed to Scotland. Our annual reports illustrate how we are building and strengthening relations with stakeholders, and how we leverage expertise and investment from our UK-wide business to support key sectors in Scotland.
defaultOur remit is to maintain and enhance the value of our assets over the long-term while delivering a return to government, and to do so with due regard to good management. This means that, in managing assets commercially, we consider how our investments and developments may deliver real benefits to communities, to Scotland and to the UK generally.
defaultIn fulfilling this role, our team in Scotland and London work to enable and facilitate sustainable economic development.
defaultIn mature sectors, such as tourism and aquaculture, we invest in, and secure investment in, specific projects (e.g. marine leisure developments). We also work with industry, local authorities and agencies such as Highlands &amp; Islands Enterprise (HIE), to ensure a coordinated and collaborative approach at local, regional and national level.
defaultIn emerging sectors such as offshore 
defaultrenewables
default and carbon capture &amp; storage (CCS), we coordinate a range of strategic activity designed to accelerate development and de-risk investment. We work closely with organisations such as Marine Scotland, Scottish Enterprise and local authorities, in addition to developers and energy companies, to help establish this sector within the UK’s energy mix.
default&#xa0;defaultActivity since the SAC ReportdefaultWe have identified below the general categories within the conclusions and recommendations section of the SAC’s Report on The Crown Estate. In each case we have identified the actions undertaken by The Crown Estate in response. We have also indicated where a recommendation is outside of our remit, as defined in The Crown Estate Act 1961.
default&#xa0;defaultThe current arrangements in respect of formal accountability to the Treasury and the Scotland Office are defined within the 1961 Crown Estate Act.  It would require primary legislation to change this.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn its response to the Committee’s report, the Government acknowledged the measures being undertaken by The Crown Estate to improve accountability. These include offering to give oral evidence annually to the Scottish Parliament’s Rural Affairs, Climate Change &amp; Environment Committee and the Economy, Energy &amp; Tourism Committee to provide MSPs the opportunity to scrutinise the work of The Crown Estate in Scotland. The Crown Estate attended the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee on 14 November 2012 and 11 September 2013 and the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee on 27 March 2013.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Government also set up an Inter-Ministerial Strategic Group (IMSG), chaired by a Treasury Minister, with membership from The Crown Estate, the Scotland Office and the Scottish Government, as well as a local authority representative. The Group will consider the activities of The Crown Estate and review its strategy for the year ahead.  The first meeting of the Group is scheduled to take place on 6 November.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe officials’ group set up to support the IMSG met in February 2013 and agreed terms of reference and a standing agenda. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Crown Estate is a UK-wide organisation with an award-winning approach to integrated reporting.
default In line with standard practice, we do not provide net accounts for Scotland. However, we
default 
defaulthave provided some information about gross expenditure in our Scotland Report derived from our NAO audited accounts. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis information has included disaggregating the Scottish component of our investment in the Round 3 offshore wind programme (two of the nine Round 3 projects are in Scottish waters), in response to a request from the Rural Affairs, Climate Change &amp; Environment Committee. This investment has primarily been in our Enabling Actions, a programme of strategic activity designed to de-risk investment and accelerate development.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Crown Estate now has an extensive and structured programme of regular stakeholder engagement which includes Government, parliamentarians, local authorities, government agencies, NDPBs, commercial and community partners, along with industry representative bodies. For example, there is now a schedule of meetings with Scottish Ministers in addition to the regular Scottish Parliament Committee sessions.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Crown Estate set up the Scottish Liaison Group in 2007 comprising key stakeholders, this Group has been supplemented with separate meetings for particular sectors such as offshore renewable energy and aquaculture. By developing the format in this way, we aim to improve co-ordination, sharing of information and ensure the Group is working to best effect. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition, we hold annual receptions in Edinburgh and a range of workshops with stakeholders (such as the one held with senior team of HIE and our Chief Executive in September 2013). We have established a Memorandum of Understanding with the University of Highlands &amp; Islands, 
defaultto help communities benefit from the generation of low carbon energy
default, focusing on creating the right training infrastructure and in promoting innovation and research.
defaultWe also contribute to wider debates, providing our insight and expertise to help inform policy debate and decision-making. We responded to the Scottish Government-commissioned Land Reform Review Group’s consultation in January 2013. In addition, our Chief Executive, Scottish Commissioner and Rural and Coastal Portfolio Manager for Scotland met with members of the Group including the Chair, Dr Alison Eliot, in September 2013. We intend to respond to the Scottish Affairs Committee’s consultation on land reform.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are partners in a range of joint-working initiatives, reflecting our commitment to working collaboratively with stakeholders at the local, regional and national level.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe managing agents’ contract for the coastal estate has been retendered to ensure that they are more firmly embedded within the communities that they serve and we are rolling out engagement training for all managing agents.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe work closely with communities to meet shared objectives. While The Crown Estate Act 1961 does constrain the organisation’s capacity to invest in projects that do not meet its commercial remit, in practice the overall programme of investment is aligned with supporting sustainable economic growth in Scotland. On this basis, communities do benefit from reinvestment of revenues raised.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn response to concerns raised by coastal communities, we introduced Local Management Agreements (LMAs) in 2012. LMAs provide access to seabed and foreshore and help local communities to secure funds to develop projects designed to take advantage of the economic opportunities offered by, for example, the growth of marine leisure.
default&#xa0;
defaultThree such agreements now exist for proposed projects in 
defaultLochmaddy
default, 
defaultPortree
default and 
defaultGigha
default. Our team provides on-going support and advice to the project partners, and we recently announced a £380,000 investment in 
defaultComan
defaultn
default 
defaultna
default Mara’s development at 
defaultLochmaddy
default, North 
defaultUist
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are also investing £375,000 in new mountain bike facilities on the 
defaultGlenlivet
default Estate, including new bike trails and a visitor centre. This builds on our work in recent decades to develop the area as a tourist destination, supporting business diversification and community regeneration. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn relation to offshore renewable energy, we are piloting an education programme for secondary pupils (working with 
defaultKeir
default Bloomer’s team at the Sustainable Learning Partnership) to ensure that they are aware of and able to take advantage of opportunities in offshore 
defaultrenewables
default. The programme is project-based, cross-curricular and is aligned with Curriculum for Excellence, using active learning to cover wider themes of sustainability.
default&#xa0;
defaultLast year The Crown Estate invested £9.6 million in Scotland of which £5.9 million was in the Energy &amp; Infrastructure portfolio covering offshore 
defaultrenewables
default and carbon capture &amp; storage (CCS). In addition, around £100,000 is invested each year in coastal projects through the Marine Stewardship Fund and £200,000 is invested in aquaculture research (this will rise to £250,000 per year from 2013/14).
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultMuch of our work is designed to unlock potential. A recent example is our work with Scottish Government and HIE to facilitate BT’s 
defaultinstallation of 400km of subsea cables over 19 crossings to islands to deliver fibre broadband to over 80% homes and businesses in Highlands &amp; Islands. 
defaultRecognising the significant social and economic benefits that broadband will bring communities, The Crown Estate made a variation to standard terms for submarine telecoms cables. This helped make the project viable and gave BT certainty at an early stage. 
default&#xa0;
defaultA further example is our work on data-sharing designed to help further sector development by addressing knowledge gaps and avoiding duplication of surveys or other forms of research. Our bespoke spatial planning tool 
defaultMaRS
default has been used by Marine Scotland to help inform marine planning, and the Marine Data Exchange (found at http://www.marinedataexchange.co.uk/) provides 
defaultaccess to survey data and reports collated during the planning, building and operating of offshore renewable energy projects.
default&#xa0;defaultThese changes would require primary legislation
defaultHowever, at an operational level The Crown Estate has agreed in principle appropriate protocols with Marine Scotland to ensure that our energy activities, roles and responsibilities, are aligned with the objectives of Scottish Government. Equally, we work closely with local authorities, particularly those in the Highlands &amp; Islands, to ensure effective collaboration and cooperation.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe SAC’s objectives have been met in full. The Crown Estate transferred the land in West Princes Street Gardens to the City of Edinburgh Council in October 2012. In August 2013, King’s Park was transferred to Scottish Ministers, while ensuring local control and management of the land through a ground lease to Stirling Council.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe transfer of naturally occurring oysters and mussels to Marine Scotland on behalf of Scottish Ministers has been agreed in principle and is expected to be completed in the next few months. 
defaultThe commercial value of salmon, gold and silver prevent the transfer of these at nil value due to the requirements of The Crown Estate Act.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are close to 140 river salmon fishing tenancies, including more than a third with angling clubs or associations
default. We
default seek to encourage other such groups to take up leases and have recently supported new local angling associations by granting leases on the River Leven in Fife and the West Lothian Almond, enabling the communities to enjoy access to salmon angling at an affordable cost (reflecting the recovering salmon stocks and water quality). 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Crown Estate continues to buy and sell land and property on this basis.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe welcome the continued interest and engagement of the Scottish Affairs Committee members in our work and, for our part, would be keen to continue this dialogue and to arrange site visits to areas where we are active.

default This is separate from and in addition to the Coastal Communities Fund (CCF). The CCF was set up by HM Treasury and is administered by the Big Lottery Fund. It consists of 50 per cent of the annual gross revenues from The Crown Estate’s marine activities. From 2012/13 to 2015/16, this will total £10.85 million. CCF is aimed at projects that promote sustainable economic development.
