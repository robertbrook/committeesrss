"Written evidence submitted by the Law Society of England and Wales (LAI 0049)&#xa0;Introduction1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe proposed introduction of a residence test for civil legal aid claimants, so as to limit legal aid to those with a “strong connection” with the UK \n1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe proposed restriction on the scope of legal aid available to prisoners \n1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe propo\nsal that providers of legal services in applications for judicial review against public bodies should only be paid for work done on the case if the Court grants permission for the application to proceed \n1.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe proposal that legal aid should be re\nmoved for al\nl cases assessed as \nhaving “borderline” prospects of success. \n&#xa0;Overarching concerns about the proposals2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFirst, t\nhere is a genuine risk that all four proposals will lead to the erosion of access to justice, particularly in relation to cases against public bodies.  As a consequence, public bodies may increasingly be able to act with i\nmpunity as the ability of citizens to challenge them is reduced.\n2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSecond, t\nhe proposals, which risk depriving the poorest and most vulnerable citizens of a legal remedy, are potentially detrimental to the concept of equality before the law and the ability o\nf all citizens to have equal access to justice.\n&#xa0;Legitimacy of  the government's objectives&#xa0;&#xa0;\n3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo further reduce the cost of legal aid; and\n&#xa0;\n3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo restore \npublic confidence in legal aid.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Prison Law scope cuts&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n8.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCases involving the determination of a criminal \ncharge for the purposes of Article 6 ECHR (right to a fair trial);\n&#xa0;\n8.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCases engaging Article 5.4 ECHR (right to have ongoing detention reviewed); and\n&#xa0;\n8.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe most serious disciplinary matters that meet the 'Tarrant Criteria'.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n9.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nSociety’s view\n is that imprisonment should not deprive prisoners of protection of their basic human rights.\n&#xa0;\n9.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have particular concerns about the impact  on  prisoners with mental health and learning disabilities who cannot reasonably be expected to negot\niate the internal complaints procedures \nwithout assistance.\n&#xa0;\n9.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe are sceptical of the MOJ assurance that 'reasonable adjustments' will be made to internal\n complaints procedures to make them accessible to prisoners with mental health problems or learning disabilities.\n Without the ever present risk of legal intervention a strong incentive to maintain an effective system is removed.\n&#xa0;\n9.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe cuts will disproportio\nnately impact on black and ethnic minority males who are disproportionately represented in the prison population.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;A residence test that will make 12 months lawful residence in the UK a requirement for eligibility for civil legal aid.&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n15.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe believe that \nthe\n \ndisproportionate adverse effect \nof a residence test \non non UK nationals may amount to unlawful discrimination. It \nis likely to be unlawful under s29 of the Equali\nty Act\n 2010\n, which prohibits discrimination in the provision of services including those provided by public authorities.\n If \nthe residence test amounts to unlawful discrimination on the ground of nationality, there is no statutory defence\n in the Equality Act\n.\n&#xa0;\n15.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt may be discriminatory under Article 14 \n(prohibition of discrimination) \ncombined with Article 6 \n(right to a fair trial) \nof the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)\n. Article 14 requires that there should be no unjustified \ndiff\nerence of \ntreatment between people who are similarly placed in relation to rights guaranteed by the Convention. As \nlegal aid is only available for matters of English law \nfor proceedings before domestic courts it is difficult to see how residence status can\n be a \nlegal \nbasis for distinguishing\n between people\n for the purpose of legal aid eligibility.\n Article 1 requires states to secure Convention rights to 'everyone within their jurisdiction'.\n&#xa0;\n15.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA change of this nature interferes with the common law rights \nof access to the \ncourts and non discrimination.\n&#xa0;\n According to \nthe now well-established common \nlaw principle of legality, the general words of the power to make regulations in LASPO are not apt to allow such a fundamental interference with constitutional ri\nghts, which can only be effected by primary legislation.\n&#xa0;\n15.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt may also fall foul of EU prohibitions of discrimination on grounds of nationality and EU law provisions such as Article 47 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights which provides that legal aid sh\nall be made available to those who lack sufficient resources to ensure effective access to justice in relation to the implementation of EU law.  It may also be contrary, depending on the circumstances of the case, to legal aid provisions under Council Dire\nctive 2002/8/EC which provides that persons involved in cross border disputes are entitled to appropriate legal aid to obtain effective access to justice. Article 4 of the Directive \nstates that legal aid must be made available without discrimination to EU \ncitizens and third country nationals residing lawfully in a member state. The 12 month qualification rule is incompatible with this provision.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;The government's response to consultation regarding the residence test&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJudicial review funding cuts&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The government's response to consultation regarding JR funding and further consultation on JR&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n28.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe reason for the provider not obtaining a costs agreement (whether in full or in part) as part of any settlement, not seeking a costs order, or the court not awarding a costs order (whether in full or part). This will include consideration of the conduct\n of the provider under the pre-action protocol and in the proceedings; \n&#xa0;\n28.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe extent to which the client obtained the remedy, redress or benefit they had been seeking in the proceedings; \n&#xa0;\n28.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe reason why the client in fact obtained any remedy, redress or be\nnefit they had been seeking in the proceedings\n; and\n \n&#xa0;\n28.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe likelihood, considered at the point the settlement is made (or the case is otherwise concluded), of permission having been granted if the application had been considered, whether from a specific ind\nication in the proceedings by the Court or based on the strength of the claim at that point.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nRemoving the ‘borderline’ merits test criterion&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Equalities Issues&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n27 September 2013\nPage \n6 of \n7&#xa0;\n"
