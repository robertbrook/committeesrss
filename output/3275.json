"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Alan Jordan, owner of Jordan Products Ltd (SRN 051)Having established my own design and manufacturing business in Ballyclare, Northern Ireland, I have worked with the Highways Agency (HA) since 2002 to develop a fully HA-approved \nmechanised system (Conemaster) to lift and lay traffic cones on the Strategic Road Network with new levels of speed, efficiency and safety. My reason for this submission is to set out how Conemaster can improve the network for all users and to draw on my o\nwn experience with HA to illustrate the need for its reform. \nConemaster is a British product which has been independently assessed by the International company Jacobs. It\n’\ns report in February 2012 accepted that Conemaster had the potential to save lives, \nto provide high value for money and to reduce congestion across the HA strategic road network. Despite being market ready and available since 2006, powerful vested interests working, in my view, with HA have ensured that Conemaster remains excluded from en\ntering the home market. \n&#xa0;Executive Summary&#xa0;\ni)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe approach to Road Worker Safety within the HA is in need of urgent and sweeping reform. The real picture regarding road worker incidents has been hidden for many years by systematic under-reporting. Recent fi\ngures provide an alarming picture\n*.  \n              \n(See section 3.6 below) *&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ncompared with 2011, the total number of s\ntatutory\n reportable incidents involving road worker\ns\n has risen from 47 to a staggering 1747 incidents for the last 12 month period.\n \n** \n              \n(See section 1.1 below) **&#xa0;\nii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe “Actions for Roads” paper says little about safety. It suggests, however, that continuous improvement seeks to develop, \n“technical innovations and behavioural measures to ensure road works are delivered safely”\n :\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe HA’s handling of \nConemaster starkly illustrates that this is not part of the culture that exists in the HA or the industry today. There is unlikely to be a change in this direction without the Government (or the Committee) holding the HA (and its major contractors) more ro\nbustly to account.\n \n(See section 3. below)&#xa0;\niii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAction for roads states that \n“A single incident that closes a three-lane motorway for four hours can cost several million pounds in lost time, and there \nare some 80,000 incidents that impact at least one motorway \nlane each year.”\n \n(Source: Action for Roads - page47 sect3.44)\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nvery significantly, the Jacobs report accepted that Conemaster would save at least 30 minutes per road closure for the installation and removal of traffic cones and lamps with the resulting fin\nancial efficiencies – despite this the industry (and HA) have been unwilling to invest in the new technology. \n&#xa0;\niv)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Jacobs report accepted that Conemaster would significantly improve road worker safety, reduce congestion, and offer savings of around £5.5m \nper year. It assessed Conemaster as a “high value for money” product with a benefit to cost ratio of 2.06\n*From the results it can be seen 13,000 hours per year of extra lane availability is achievable across the Strategic Road Network.\n**   * Jacobs Feb 2012 report p7 sect 3.1 and p18-19 sect14 b.\n** extrapolated from 26,000 closures per year X 30 minute saving per closure = 13,000 hours extra lane availability.\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nfurthermore, endorsements have been received from 2 Transport Ministers\n \n(10th Aug\n 2006 and 9th July 2012.)\n \n; and\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ndespite the independent report and the Ministers’ views, the five major companies to whom we wrote and e-mailed, on the advice of the Minister at the time, did not acknowledge or reply – this illustrates, further, the lack \nof interest in addressing seriously issues of safety, efficiency and congestion.. \n&#xa0;\nv)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe HA has clearly either lacked the appropriate data or mis-used data. This was particularly evident during the Jacobs review process:\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDr McCrea M.P. found it necessary t\no ask PQs \n[92139 &amp; 92140] to reveal simple facts about the total number of road closures in the course of a year. The HA’s initial figures, typically 120,000\n* road closures per year became 25,713 road closures for 2011\n.  \n*HA Conemaster Cost Study for the Minister  29th June 2011 - Annex 1: Detailed calculations relating to Automated Cone Laying Machines. \n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTypically costing £1000 per closure\n*, this represented a difference in costs of around £90m per year potentially.\n  \n*HA Conemaster Cost Study for the Minister  29th June 2011 - Annex 1: Detailed calculations relating to Automated Cone Laying Machines.&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDr McCrea questioned the HA on how the Minister could rely on the information he was given? He was being expected to make decisions based on erroneous da\nta.\n*          \n* minutes of a meeting Dr McCrea A. Jordan, HA  26th March 2012 sect 2.7 - Inconsistency of figures&#xa0;\nvi)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is a very serious question why, collectively, the HA and all its major contractors on the strategic road network have been able to turn \ntheir back on \na technology which can provide greater efficiency, improve journey time reliability and reduce road worker casualties without any significant challenge by either Government or Parliament. Conemaster has been excluded from the market since 200\n6, largely through the responses of the HA and its major contractors. In my view this has the appearance of some kind of cartel in operation. They have clearly all decided, possibly in concert, to reject investment in a technology which would bring conside\nrable benefits to the public purse and to road users and road workers. Ministers, Parliament and taxpayers rightfully deserve higher standards from the HA especially in dealing with issues where the public interest is so clearly at stake. \n&#xa0;\n1.1\n \nSafety represents only a small part of the “Action for Roads” document and has been omitte\nd from the specific terms of reference for this enquiry but it is a major issue of public concern and should be an integral part of the work of this enquiry; Statutory reportable incidents involving road workers have grown by a staggering amount according \nto recent figures:\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMr Fitzpatrick M.P., in a PQ in September 2012 [120374], was informed that there was a total of 47 road worker injuries during 2011 on motorways. Over a 3 year period from 2009 – 2011 there were 2 fatalities involving road workers on mo\ntorways.\n \nhttp://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120912/text/120912w0001.htm \n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nhowever, a recent press release from the HA states \nthat:\n “Eight road workers have been killed in the last three years and during the last 12 months there have been 1747 incidents where road workers were injured while improving and maintaining the strategic road network in England.”\n \nSource:HA press release 21 Oct 2013. http://www.highways.gov.uk/news/press-releases/road-worker-tells-how-drunk-driver-careered-towards-them-on-the-m1/ \n&#xa0;\nHow can one account for this staggering increase? Was there systematic under-reporting for many years and, if so, why? Has there been a huge increase in recent times and why?&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf implemented, “Action for Roads” states that \nthe HA seeks to develop:\n “technical innovations and behavioural measures to ensure road works are delivered safely.” \n(Page 48 Sect. 3.4.6)\n \nOpportunities clearly exist for greater efficiency, “A single incident that closes a three-lane motorway for four hours can cost several \nmillion pounds in lost time, and there are some 80,000 incidents that impact at least one motorway lane each year.”\n \n(Source: Action for Roads – page 47 sect. 3.44)&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nin reality, new technology such as Conemaster has been systematically excluded from enterin\ng the HA market since 2006 despite being independently assessed, even endorsed by the Minister\n*, to provide \n“considerable safety and economic benefits” for the HA Network.\n     * Letter to Dr McCrea from the Minister 9th July 2012   \n&#xa0;\n1.3\n \nReducing congestion by an average of 30 minutes per closure through the mechanisation of cone laying and retrieval activities would significantly reduce emissions and, therefore, the carbon footprint across the Strategic Road Network. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.  How can we improve the reliability and efficiency of travel on the strategic road network? What impact will New Technology have on the Strategic Road Network?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1\n \n Travel disruption caused by road maintenance is a big issue for the road user. Journey time reliability is directly impacted by these road closures. New technology such as Conemaster has been independently assessed by Jacobs to save at least 30 minutes pe\nr closure across the Strategic Road Network. Journey Time Reliability would be significantly improved, using Conemaster, for the 21% of road closures which take place during the day (between 6am and 8pm) and the 79% of closures at night (between 6pm and 6a\nm).\nJacobs Report Feb 2012 Page15 - Sect 4.2.4 - Updated Lane Closure Information.

Carriageway crossings are frequently required to manually carry cones and lamps across often several live motorway lanes. Conemaster would all but elimi\nnate such crossings.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n \n Mechanising dangerous manual handling\n tasks has the capacity to remove road workers from the live lane whilst speeding up the manual handling tasks. The time workers and motorists are exposed to high risk would be significantly reduced. \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTravelling at 15 mph working at rates of up to 40 cones\n per minute,\n* Conemaster’s speed of operation reduces the time which road workers and motorists are exposed to high risk\n.  -\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n“…traffic cones will be laid and taken up quicker enabling more routine maintenance work to be undertaken during each closure so red\nucing the frequency of road works and congestion.” \n* Source: Transport Minister’s statement 2006 http://www.gov-news.org/gov/uk/news/new_cone_laying_machine_make_roadworks_safer/59291.html&#xa0;\n2.3 \nThe adoption of new technology brings with it the potential to effect major efficiencies and cost control. This does not appear to have influenced either the HA\n’s thinking or that of its major contractors. Collectively they appear content to accept the current inefficiencies and costs:\n&#xa0;-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA Benefit to Cost Ratio of 2.06, independently assessed by Jacobs, makes Conemaster High Value for Money.\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n \n An average saving across the Network of at least 30 minutes per road closure through the adoption of Conemaster has been independently assessed as valid by Jacobs. This would improve Journey Time Reliability across the Strategic Road Network for the 21% o\nf road closures during the day (between 6am and 8pm) and the 79% of closures at night (between 6pm and 6am).*\n&#xa0; *Jacobs Report Feb 2012 P15 - Sect 4.2.4 - Updated Lane Closure Information.

What roles should Government and the private sector play to ensure better management of the strategic road network?  &#xa0;\n3.1\n \nGovernment policy to increase direct spend \nwith SME’s has the capacity to introduce competition into a market which is already averse to modernisation and investment in new technology.\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nReform is required for procurement contracts in respect of SMEs to ensure that small companies are not exploited.\n A TRL draft contract 2009 regarding a Conemaster trial sought the manufacturing and Intellectual Property Rights for Conemaster in bad faith for the benefit of the Crown. \n&#xa0;\n3.2\n \n The method by which Road Worker Safety is managed across the Network is deserving of major reform. For years, a flawed system has evolved which accepts significant conflict of interest between the HA and its major contractors. The Road Worker Safety Forum\n (RoWSaF), chaired by the HA, involves major contractors in the decision making process even though safety concerns and commercial interests are inevitably open to conflict of interest. This potentially allows powerful commercial vested interests to exerci\nse considerable influence over any SME wishing to enter this lucrative market with a new innovative, HA-approved, safety-driven product.\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nin my view, this possibly explains the problem of the acceptance of poor data in respect of ‘reportable’ incidents, wh\nich has meant that the true extent of “reportable” incidents has not been brought fully to the attention of Ministers and Parliament for many years. \n&#xa0;\n3.3\n \nThe following comments which were obtained under freedom of information put into context the serious need\n for strong leadership combined with a fresh approach to road worker safety:\ni.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n”some activities are intolerable from an H&amp;S perspective” RoWSaF\n Working Group Minutes 30-06-2011 Sect 4.4\n ii.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n“there is no other area of work where it would be acceptable for people to work at such danger.” RoWSaF Working Group Minutes 30-06-2011 – sect 4.5\niii.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n“The HA had experienced a particularly bad year for injuries, across road workers and construction and maintenance workers. The indication is that the situation has not improved and that in some areas it is worse. Data feedback indicates that many of these incidents are avoidable.” RoWSaF Steering  Group Minutes  18-07-2011 – Ginny Clarke HA   Section 6\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n \n \nThe Committee may wish to examine decisions taken regarding “cone laying machines” within the RoWSaF Trials Team minutes from 2006 to present. These minutes were robustly withheld from me under Freedom of Information by the HA, supported by the Department \non the grounds of \n“\npublic interest\n”\n. This raises \nfurther doubt and suspicion about RoWSaF’s decisions preventing the adoption of cone laying machines. It does not appear to be in the public interest. \n&#xa0;\n3.5 \n A culture appears to exist within the HA where misle\nading information can be presented to support a pre-determined agenda\n. This dogged the early stages of the Jacobs review process. To gather accurate data required the use of freedom of information and the seeking of answers from the HA by my local M.P.\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe HA’s handling of the Conemaster Cost Study \n(29\nth\n June 2011)\n and Jacobs Review would make a useful case study for the Committee to draw lessons regarding the HA’s poor control of Health &amp; Safety, maintenance costs and its approach to the introduction of\n innovative British technology.\n&#xa0;3.6\n \n There is a lack of transparency relating to important matters such as safety. Under-reporting of work-related incidents has existed across the HA Network for many years. Despite this, figures for road worker incidents did \nnot show significant improvement. The Committee might wish to challenge why road worker incidents have escalated to 1747 over the past 12 months. \n(as discussed earlier in item 1.1 above)\n&#xa0;-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUnder Freedom of Information, a HA audit report concerning Incident\n and Near Miss Reporting published 21-12-2011 found:  \n“Not all Agency staff are fully aware of reporting systems and the requirement to report incidents under RIDDOR legislation. There is under reporting of incidents by both Agency staff and contractors; a\nnd some significant difficulties experienced by contractors in accessing and updating the AIRS database.”\n  \nhttp://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/116256/response/286424/attach/4/Incident%20and%20Near%20Miss%20Reporting%20redacted.pdf&#xa0;&#xa0;3.7\n \nConflicts of interest appear to exist between the HA and major contractors. The industry appears free to dictate cost, effici\nency and even safety performance exhibiting the hallmarks of a cartel. From years of experience seeking to enter the HA market with an innovative British product, Conemaster is proof that SMEs have little chance of entering this important market. This is a\npparent from the final paragraph of the Jacobs Independent Review regarding the possible adoption of Conemaster by major contractors. The final paragraph states: \n&#xa0;\n“\nThis experience suggests some uncertainty as to\n&#xa0;\nextent to which the traffic management indu\nstry\n&#xa0;\nwill adopt the machine and make sufficiently efficient use of it\n in order\n&#xa0;\nto realise\n&#xa0;\nthe \nestimated benefits in practice.\n”\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\nPage \n7 of \n7&#xa0;\n"
