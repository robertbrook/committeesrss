[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Summary&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Introduction&#xa0;I am British, 38 year old female scientist (currently Head of Synthetic Biology at The Sainsbury Laboratory, Norwich NR4 7UH, UK). Since completing my PhD in 2000 at age 25 I have moved cities four times to progress my career. Three of these moves have been international. My current contract is for two years and I expect that at least one more national or international move will be necessary. My partner currently lives 16 741 km away in Melbourne, Australia. We do not have children. &#xa0;My female peers who obtained their PhDs in the same year as me but who chose to have children have all left academia. Decisions to find different careers were usually made before the birth of a child when the realization that pursuing an academic career would mean years of transient living, living in a different city or country to their partner and giving up the possibility of having a family.                            &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Evidence&#xa0;When do most women drop out?How does the academic early-to-mid career path affect women?&#xa0;

[[[lowships]]] [Fellows] must not undertake their fellowship in the country of their nationality or recent centre of activity. &#xa0;

[[[EMBO Fellowships]]] All applications must involve movement between countries. The receiving institute or the applicant’s nationality must be from one of the EMBC Member States. Applications to go to the country in which the PhD was obtained will not be considered. Applications for a Long-Term Fellowship to be held in the laboratory, institute or department in which the candidate worked to obtain his or her PhD, or to work again with the candidate's PhD supervisor, no matter where the latter is located, will not be considered.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Human Frontiers]]] The following are ineligible: (1) Applicants who have spent 12 or more months in the proposed host country. The combined duration of all previous research-related stays in the host country is taken into account and cannot exceed 12 months at the start of the fellowship. The sole exception to this rule are visits of less than one month to the host country as part of formal undergraduate education (up to the Bachelor degree level). (2) Applicants who… have spent a total of 12 months (consecutive or not) with their proposed host supervisor.  (3) Applicants who started their current work in the proposed host institution or host country prior to 1 April 2013. (4) Applications to work with: former scientific collaborators; former research supervisors; scientists with whom the applicant has published; and scientific colleagues/supervisors. &#xa0;

[[[Wellcome Trust BioMedical Fellowships]]] The fellowship should normally include periods in more than one laboratory, either in the UK or overseas. There is no time limit on the amount of time spent outside the sponsoring institution. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Recommendations
