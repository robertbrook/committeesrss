"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the International Biochar Initiative and UK Biochar Research Centre (CCS26)Executive Summary&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCarbon capture and storage by photosynthesis and thermochemical conversion.&#xa0;\nIn the remainder of this submission we discuss one such technology, biochar,  to illustrate the principles.\nCO\n2\n + H\n2\nO + sunlight → O\n2\n + \n(\nHCOH\n)\n.\nThat is, u\nsing sunlight energy and releasing oxygen\n, p\nlant\ns\n combine water and \nCO\n2\n \nto form \nsugars and \nlarge structural molecules\n (HCOH representing one link in a long\n-chain polymer such as cellulose\n)\n.\n  Respiration by animals and microbes (including bacteria and fungi) reverse\ns\n this process.\n  \nThese annual natural flows of \nCO\n2\n to and from the atmosphere are \nvery \nlarge compared to anthropogenic emissions but photosynthetic fixation and respiration are nearly in balance.  \nPreventing\n the re-oxidation of \nsome of \nthe carbon temporarily fixed by photosynthes\nis, could \nshift the balance towards sequestration\n.\nThis chemical transformation of pla\nnt material by the action of heat, py\nrolysis\n,\n \ncan be\n \ndeployed\n \non a large scale \nto convert \nagricultural residues \nand other biomass wastes \nthat are presently \nnot \nused, or used\n only\n inefficiently.  Even if confined to this subset of plant materials, the process could\n potentially\n increase net withdrawal of atmospheric \nCO\n2\n, by about 3.7 billion (3,700,000,000) tonnes annually, or\n \n1/8 \nth\n of current \nglobal \nanthropogenic emissions\n.\n  This\n \ncorresponds\n to 1 Gt (1 billion tonnes) of carbon.\nThe carbon content of a \nbio\nchar can be determined reliably and cheaply by chemical analysis.\n \nRecently\n techniques have been developed to assess\n,\n with growing confidence\n,\n the resistance of \nbio\nchars to biological and \nnon\n-biological oxidation\n, so that they can act as a stable\n \nstore of carbon for periods \nfar \ngreater than 100 years\n.\n  \nCombining these techniques permits the quantity of carbon stored\n permanently by a project or on-going business\n \nto be\n measured.\nNew businesses\n might emerge\n, specialising in the selection and sourcing of CRS\n units for onward sale to fuel suppliers.\nThe i\nmposition\n of post-emission CCS obligations on primary suppliers of petroleum-derived transport fuels would \nmodify\n the working of the carbon markets.  Those with C\nR\nS obligations would only be \nallowed\n to purchase certain \nproducts within the carbon markets to meet their responsibilities.  Other market participants – those needing to buy units to stay within their cap\n – could buy existing emission permits\n,\n or the new C\nR\nS units.   Th\nis might raise demand \nfor the CR\nS units above that needed to \nretract\n emissions from mobile sources, but only if\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe CRS units were cheaper than\n the surplus emission permits; or\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe CRS units were sought preferentially by companies to burnish their environmental credentials.\nThe\n first is unlikely until governments tighten the emission\ns\n caps significantly.  The second applies to some ex\ntent already because \nBioc\nhar-CR\nS units are traded in the \nvoluntary carbon markets \nin \nsmall\n volumes.\n \nW\ne anticipate that larger\n,\n more liquid markets \nwould be highly competitive.  \nA second supposition – that the fuel supplier \nwould\n be\n \nliable \nfor the full cost of producing the biochar – is only worth investigating if biochar\n proved to be the cheapest of the\n ‘negative energy’ technologies competing in the carbon markets\n.\n \nBiochar producers can draw on several income streams\n in addition to \nthe\n carbon-credit price. \n \nIt \nis presently difficult to make a representative estimate\n \nof biochar’s \nvalue as a soil improver \nbecause it depends strongly on\n \nsoil characteristics\n and constraints\n and crop\n types and\n values\n.  The \nother \npyrolysis \nproducts, a\n combustible gas stream or a liquid fuel, may be sold for electricity generation or space heating.\n  It i\ns highly unlikely that the income from carbon credits, even in a functioning carbon market with an effective \nCO\n2\n price, will drive a bio\nchar industry\n, but rather that the costs will be borne by several income streams depending on the installation\n.  \nThe ful\nl cost of making bioc\nhar cannot be confidently \nspecified\n at present because the industry is in its infancy\n, but an estimate of £160 per tonne has been suggested for production from some sources in the UK.  That cost would add 10.7p to the price of gasoline\n per l\nitre\n, but we stress we consider this case to be remote and unlikely.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOnce incorporated into soil the material is effectively immobilised.  In some situations a fraction of the small char particles may be transported by water. Those particles will be deposited somewhere, often in deep-s\nea sediment.  These natural processes occur already.  Forest fires have put char pieces and particles onto and into the world’s soils for the past 500 million years.\nProduction of biochar needs to be done in properly-designed kilns that avoid the release o\nf gaseous pollutants.  Registration of schemes for market access\n offers a means of control.\nThe IBI and other organisations have drawn up and published quality standards for biochar that specify maximum safe limits for potential soil contaminants such as h\neavy metals, polycyclic aromatics and dioxins.\nBiochar is s\nhowing promise as a component of horticultural growing media that \ncould substantially reduce\n the damaging extraction of peat\n from environmentally-sensitive areas.\n  There is a large market for such products in the UK.\nBiochar may be effective as a delivery \nmedium for chemical fertilizers and as a means of controlling the rate of release of nutrients to crops.\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n Woolf \net al\n, 2010\n Nature Communications\n"
