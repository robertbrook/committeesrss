[normal]As Social Care lead of the Westminster 
[normal]LINk
[normal], I chaired a work group looking into how far changes in the local authority’s approach to domiciliary care contract monitoring would lead to a general improvement in quality. We concluded that carers’ electronic monitoring record should be the main source of evidence for missed visits, poor timing and too frequent changes of carer and that, where user opinion was apparently unavoidable, care should be taken that the sample of users approached would be drawn from those most at risk of poor care. In April 2012, after reading an article by the Care Quality Commission’s Director of Regulatory Development about the Domiciliary Care themed inspection, we felt that the Commission’s approach to inspection could be improved in the same way and asked for a place on its lay advisory committee where I continued to urge these points until the group was disbanded on January 31
[normal]st
[normal] 2013. Since then I have continued to press the case for a reform of inspection procedure in correspondence with the Chief Executive and by addressing the Care Quality Commission’s board.

[normal]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]Since the 2012 Health Committee hearing a number of instances of very poor care have been exposed through cameras placed by relatives or other concerned friends.
[normal] 
[normal]It is a matter of considerable concern that very often relevant
[normal] 
[normal]Commission reports on the care provider in question give no inkling that anything is amiss. This brings the Commission into disrepute.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]              
[normal]One such case related to the domiciliary care provided to Mrs Price of Blackpool.
[normal] 
[normal]In her case the presence of the camera was known to at least one of the carers because she was photographed mooning at it. Other shortcomings included
[normal] 
[normal]poor hygiene (fingers stuck in Mrs Price’s food to test temperature), lack of punctuality and occasions when the contracted visit never happened at all.
[normal] 
[normal]No user of the Commission’s reports which immediately preceded or followed these events (2010) could possibly have suspected they were occurring even though they had given rise to a safeguarding alert to the local authority.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]              
[normal]The Commission has traditionally derived its evidence from the comments of a small number of service users randomly selected from the whole population of a provider’s customers. This was the method used when Mrs Price’s provider was inspected and it remained the dominant approach in last year’s Domiciliary Care themed inspection (although considerable work was done on how the approach to users could be improved).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4
[normal]              
[normal]Relying largely on user feedback in fact biases the evidence towards those most likely to have had good experiences – those who are not suffering from dementia or fearful of the consequences of speaking out. It was no surprise therefore that the great majority of responses to the themed inspection were complimentary and that the shortcomings in Mrs Price’s care were not revealed.
[normal]3.5
[normal]              
[normal]If it had been a standard part of any inspection of domiciliary care that (1) a sample of electronic monitoring records (or in their absence time sheets) would be examined and (2) that users interviewed were drawn from those known to have received poor care (because they had complained or because of shortcomings revealed in examining the electronic monitoring or time sheets), it is possible that the themed 
[normal]inspection would have
[normal] 
[normal]uncovered more instances of non-compliance and the missed calls and timing lapses experienced by Mrs Price would have been revealed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6
[normal]              
[normal]Clocking in systems are no guide to the quality of work done or of the interactions between 
[normal]careworker
[normal] and user. If it were also part of the Commission’s approach to encourage friends and family who have installed cameras to share their footage with inspectors, it would be more likely that failures in effort, compassion or simple politeness would come to light.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.7
[normal]              
[normal]A new domiciliary care agency in London, 
[normal]Chalcot
[normal] Care, offers users, carers and concerned friends a video link allowing them to watch (and listen to) care as it is delivered.
[normal] 
[normal]If the Commission were to encourage other providers to offer such systems and to examine such footage as a standard element in inspection, a greater proportion of existing bad care would be revealed – and the total amount of bad care would decrease.
