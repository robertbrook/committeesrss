default1.  London 
defaultTravelWatch
default and Passenger Focus are the official consumer watchdogs for users of the main line, metro, light rail and tram networks in 
defaultEngland
default and 
defaultWales
default, and of the main line railways in 
defaultScotland
default.    In 2011/12 about 2.8 billion passenger trips 
defaultwere made on these systems.
default2.  Both organisations are members of the Parliamentary Advisory Committee on Transport Safety (PACTS) and are represented on its Rail Safety Working Group, which proposed this topic.  We are therefore pleased that the Select Co
defaultmmittee has chosen it as a topic for an inquiry.
default3.  Our evidence below relates solely to the main line railways operated by Network Rail.  There are comparatively few level crossings on the other rail systems within our remit, and most of these are on tra
defaultmways which operate mainly on line of sight (i.e. without signals), in some cases on-street, and present a different profile of risk.
default4.  The paper comprises an introductory note on the level and pattern of risk presented by level crossings, followed by a 
defaultcomment in reply to each of the questions listed by the Committee.  It concludes with some suggested recommendations.
default&#xa0;defaultLevel crossing risk in contextdefault&#xa0;default5.  Risk on the rail network is measured in terms of fatalities and weighted injuries (FWI), a composite 
defaultstatistic which applies weightings to injuries of varying severity in order to equate these to fatalities.  For details of the methodology, see table 1 in RSSB (formerly the Rail Safety &amp; Standards Board)’s 
defaultAnnual Safety Performance Report 2012/13
default, 
defaultfrom wh
defaultich
default 
defaultmost of the other data cited in this note are drawn.
default&#xa0;
default6.  The industry’s risk profile is continuously updated by RSSB by means of the safety risk model, which is derived from the data captured by the industry-wide safety management information system (
defaultSMIS) in which all rail operators are required by their licences to participate.  Risk presented by 
defaulttrespassers, suicides and suspected suicides is
default excluded from the following statistics.
default&#xa0;
default7.  The model shows that the total current annual FWI rate associat
defaulted with level crossings is 10.7, of which all but 1.1 is represented by fatalities.  Of the total, 9.5 is risk to members of the public, 1.0 is to passengers and 0.2 is to members of the railway workforce.
default&#xa0;
default8.  Most of the risk arises from individuals bein
defaultg struck by trains while using crossings (6.6), followed by road vehicles being struck by trains (3.2), with much lesser amounts associated with slips/trips/falls (0.5) or individuals being struck by road vehicles or crossing equipment  (0.1).

default9.  Risk arising from level crossings accounts for 11% of total railway risk.  In terms of the three categories of people 
defaultexposed to it, it represents only 2% of the risk faced by passengers and 
default1% of that faced by the workforce, but 71% of that faced by non-trespassing members of the public (who in this context are mainly road and path users).
default&#xa0;
default10.  
defaultData collected by the Eur
defaultopean Rail Agency (ERA) relate only to fatalities and to accidents involving moving trains, and are normalised 
defaultby train kilometres run.  
defaultBy this more restricted definition, Britain has the lowest level of risk of any of the European Economic Area member st
defaultates which have railways (i.e. excluding Cyprus, Iceland and Malta), with an average during 2009-11 of 19 level crossing fatalities per billion train kilometres, compared with an EEA average of 260 [see ERA’s 
defaultIntermediate report on the development of railw
defaultay safety in the European Union 2013
default].  Care should be taken in making such comparisons, because the level of risk is heavily dependent on the density and type of crossings on the network, and the volume and speed of both rail and road (or foot) traffic ov
defaulter them.  Nevertheless, it is encouraging that 
defaultBritain
default’s crossing safety performance appears to bear comparison well with other similar rail systems.
default&#xa0;
default11.  Since most casualties occurring at level crossings are suffered by pedestrians, cyclists or the occu
defaultpants of road vehicles, it is arguable that level crossing risk is best considered in the context of the overall safety of travel by road (or on footpaths), rather than by rail.  In the past decade, about 0.2% of fatalities suffered by road vehicle users h
defaultave occurred at level crossings, but in the case of cyclists, motor cyclists and pedestrians, this proportion rises to about 0.5%.  When weighted to reflect the distances travelled by each mode (i.e. per billion passenger/ pedestrian kilometres), the risk 
defaultto other road/path users is about 50 times greater than to vehicle users [data derived from the Department for Transport’s 
defaultTransport Statistics Great Britain 2012
default].
default&#xa0;
default12.  In the light of these statistics, it could be argued that for most road and rail user
defaults, level crossing risk is minimal, and resources expended on mitigating it further would deliver greater returns if they were directed elsewhere.  But a number of points should be borne in mind.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default13.  The Committee has listed seven issues on which evidence is specifically 
defaultsought.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAre current safety measures at level crossings adequate?  How should they be improveddefault? 
default&#xa0;
default14.  In common with all employers, Network Rail has a legal duty to conduct its business in such a manner as to reduce risks to health and safety so far as is “reasonably practicable”.  Taking account of court rulings over the years, the rail industry has 
defaultproduced guidance (see RSSB’s manual on 
defaultTaking safe decisions
default)
default to assist its members in interpreting this obligation.  To put the matter at its simplest, the legal duty does not (and cannot) require the total elimination of risk, but rather that it should 
defaultbe controlled at a level at which the cost, time and effort required to do so are not in “gross disproportion” to the safety benefits secured.  
default&#xa0;
default15.  There is no single, simple test of the adequacy of crossing safety measures, and they can only properly b
defaulte judged in the context of the physical and usage characteristics of individual sites.  But Network Rail has been a world leader in the development of crossing risk modelling to inform its decisions, and its overall crossing safety performance compares fav
defaultourably with that of any other equivalent rail network in Europe.  So while there is always scope for further improvement, and lapses can and do occur from time to time, the industry’s achievements and current performance should not go unacknowledged.
default&#xa0;
default16.
default  The range of possible improvements currently being deployed 
defaultincludes :
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition to bridges and defaultunderpasses what other cost-effective measures can be introduced to replace or improve safety at level crossings?default17.  Short of outright closure, grade-separation (i.e. replacing crossings by bridges or underpasses) is the only means of ensuring that the r
defaultisks associated with crossings are eliminated.  That is why the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR), the industry’s safety regulator, no longer allows new crossings to be opened, other than in wholly exceptional circumstances, and does not permit line speeds o
defaultn existing routes to be raised above 125 mph without all crossings being removed.  But such infrastructure improvements (even if they are designed only for use by pedestrians) invariably cost hundreds of thousands – if not millions – of pounds, and it is o
defaultnly at very high-risk crossings that such expenditure is likely to pass the test of “reasonable practicability” and thus be cost-effective on grounds of its safety benefits alone.  
default18.  However, where both rail and road traffic densities are high, crossin
defaultgs can cause extended delays to road vehicles and generate significant traffic congestion.  Logically, the economic impact of this congestion should be factored into the appraisal of crossing improvements.  In practice, this seldom happens, because in Brit
defaultain – unlike some other countries – the entire cost of crossing upgrades or replacements is usually borne by the railway, and highway authorities are under no obligation to contribute towards the cost of infrastructure improvements even if its primary purp
defaultose is reduce risk and delay to road users.  This apportionment of the cost burden is an historical anomaly which is overdue for correction.  Crossing-related costs should be borne equally by both the railway and the road authority, and where identifiable 
defaultcosts arise directly from (e.g.) development of land leading to higher vehicle or pedestrian 
defaultusage,
default these should be recoverable from those responsible.
default19.  Several means of improving crossing safety are listed in response to the preceding question.  Other
defaults include providing open or user-worked crossings with barriers, and/or installing telephones (to signallers) at gated crossings which do not yet have them, and/or fitting warning lights and audible alarms at footpath crossings to alert users to the approa
defaultch of trains, and/or installing obstacle detectors at automatic crossings to allow half-barriers to be replaced with full-barriers.
default&#xa0;
defaultHow should expenditure on improving safety at level crossings be prioritised in relation to other demands on the rail budgedefaultt?default20.  In order to optimise the allocation of its investment and maintenance budgets, Network Rail should apply a common appraisal yardstick both to level crossing schemes and to other 
defaultprojects, including those with a specific safety objective.  If the go
defaultvernment believes that there are legitimate societal concerns that justify a higher level of expenditure on crossings than this would provide, then it should allocate earmarked funding for this purpose.
default&#xa0;
default21.  In practice, this approximates to the current a
defaultrrangements. Network Rail is required by the Health &amp; Safety at Work etc Act 1974 (HSWA) 
defaultto reduce
default risk so far as is reasonably practicable
default, as part of its day-to-day role as the owner, operator and maintainer of the infrastructure of the national rail sys
defaulttem.  It does this 
defaultthrough, for example, 
defaultits 
defaultroutine risk assessment
defaults and its
default renewals and enhancements programmes. 
default&#xa0;
default22.  Every five years, the Secretary of State for Transport (in respect of England and Wales) and Scottish Ministers are required to publi
defaultsh their desired high level output specifications (HLOS) for the railways, and a statement of the public funds which will be available (SOFA), in the next “control period”.  In response, Network Rail sets outs its strategic business plan, itemising what it
default intends to deliver for the level of funding indicated.  It then falls to the ORR (as the industry’s economic regulator) to determine whether the plan represents an efficient and effective use of resources, and to specify in more detail the required output
defaults.  
default&#xa0;
default23.  This process provides ample opportunities for all three parties (government, industry and regulator) to review Network Rail’s record and policies towards safety in general and towards level crossings in particular, and to assess the scope for fu
defaultrther improvements alongside all of the competing claims on the allocated funds.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIs Network Rail giving sufficient priority to improving safety at level crossings?default24.  In 2010 to 2012, Network Rail achieved a 20% reduction in crossing-related risk.  The two governments’ combined SOFAs for Control Period 5 (i.e. 2014-19) made provision for £75 million of ring-fenced funding to be devoted specifically to further enhan
defaultcements in crossing safety.  
default25.  In response, in its strategic business plans for this period, published in January 2013, Network Rail has set itself 
defaulta target of reducing 
defaultlevel crossing risk
default by a further 8
default% over the control period
default. 
default This target may at first sight appear low in the light of its recent achievements, but it is important to remember that as the most cost-effective schemes are implemented, so the rate of return on further schemes diminishes, and additional increments in s
defaultafety improvement become more expensive to deliver.
default26.  The intention is to use this ring-fenced funding to close 30 particularly high-risk crossings and to install a further 200 enforcement cameras, as well as replacing whistle boards with train-detectio
defaultn equipment and providing additional telephones, miniature warning lights, power-operated gates and improved decking.
default&#xa0;
default27.  Network Rail’s published policy statement on managing crossing safety commits it, inter alia, to
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default28.  No organisation, least of all Network Rail, is perfect in every respect – as periodic reports from the Rail Accident Investigation Branch bear witness.  But there is clear evidence of a 
defaultcorporate desire further to improve its record on level crossing safety, which is already superior to that of most comparable rail systems. This is a not inconsiderable achievement, and one for which it deserves due recognition.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIs Government policy and defaultregulatory action by the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) in relation to safety at level crossings adequate?  What more should the Government and ORR do?default&#xa0;
default29.  
defaultThe government has not sought in recent years to involve itself directly in the detail of rail sa
defaultfety policy.  But in its July 2012 HLOS statement, it asserted that “
defaultThe Secretary of State specifically wishes the industry to reduce the risk of accidents at level crossings. 
default 
defaultIn accordance with advice from ORR she has made a ring-fenced provision of 
default£65m over CP5 to facilitate the achievement of this outcome by enabling Network Rail to invest to reduce risk.
default”
default&#xa0;
default30.  
defaultThe equivalent statement by Scottish Ministers, published the previous month, announced the establishment of a
default separate
default £10 million level 
defaultcrossings fund.  This would be made 
defaultavailable,
default it was stated, 
default“
defaultin addition to the baseline funding requirement for level crossing safety in Scotland
default, to support Network Rail, local a
defaultuthorities and other local stakeholders to work in partnership to facilita
defaultte the closure of level crossings in Scotland.”
default&#xa0;
default31.  No similar provision was made for any other facet of rail safety.  Both governments have therefore acknowledged the priority to be given to level crossings in the industry’s overall safety enhancement p
defaultrogramme.
default&#xa0;
default32.  In its 
defaultDraft determination of Network Rail’s outputs and funding for 2014-19
default (published in June 2013 and subject to public consultation until October this year) the ORR proposes that 
default“
defaultNetwork Rail should provide us with its plan to maximise
default the reduction in the risk of accidents at level crossings in CP5 and using the ring-fenced fund, before March
default 
default2014. 
default 
defaultWe ex
defaultpect the ring-fenced fund to 
defaultbe :
default 
default(a)
default 
defaultused to deliver the maximum risk reduction irrespective of geographical location
default 
default(England, Scot
defaultland and Wales);
default 
default(b)
default 
defaultretained as a central fund; and
default 
default(c)
default 
defaultused across the whole level crossin
defaultg portfolio.  
defaultThe delivery of the planned package of projects in CP5, to achieve the maximum reduction in risk of accidents at level crossings using the £67m ring-f
defaultenced fund is a
default 
defaultregulated output
default.”
default  
defaultIt adds that “t
defaulthe risk redu
defaultction achieved by using the ring
default-fenced level crossing fund is in addition to reducing risk so far as is reasonably practicable through, for example, routine risk assessment and the renewals 
defaultand enhancements programmes.
default”
default 
default&#xa0;
default33.  ORR’s 
defaultHealth &amp; Safety Report 2013 
defaultnotes that “
defaultNetwork Rail is committed to reducing level crossing risk 25% by 2019 and it is currently on-target, as
default 
defaultmeasured by its own model, to deliver this. 
default 
defaultThis improvement has com
defaulte through strong leadership from senior managers and demonstrates what can be achieved with the right focus
default.”  However, the report goes on to record that “w
defaulte found that in the routes,
default 
defaultsome level crossing risk assessments were poor and did not identify the 
defaultbest risk controls. We also found that risk assessments were
default 
defaultnot always being carried out at the right stage of the renewal and enhancement process, which introduced delays and additional costs at the
default 
defaultlevel crossing commissioning
default 
defaultstage.
default  
defaultWe note that Netwo
defaultrk Rail has recently introduced route
default-
defaultlevel crossing managers and a national level crossing team, which should improve the quality of the risk assessment process.
default”
default 
default&#xa0;
default34.  
defaultORR has summarised its policy on level crossings in the following 
defaultterms :
default“
defaultGreat Britain’s level crossing safety record is among the best in the world, but every incident has the potential for significant human and economic loss. 
default 
defaultLevel crossings are the single biggest source of railway catastrophic risk, but overall the risks ar
defaulte well managed. 
default“
defaultWe seek to influence 
defaultdutyholders
default and others to reduce risk at Britain’s level crossings. 
default 
defaultWe do this through a variety of means ranging from advic
defaulte to formal enforcement action…  
defaultRisk control should, where practicable, be achieved through the elimination of level crossings in favour of bridges, underpasses or diversions. 
default 
defaultWhere elimination is not possible, we aim to ensure that duty holders reduce risk 
defaultso
default far as is reasonably pract
defaulticable and in accordance with the principles of protection.
default“As the safety regulator for Britain’s railways, our role is to provide clear advice and enforce relevant legislation – including that which relates to level crossings.  We also exercise delegated
default powers of the Secretary of State in making level crossing orders under 
defaultthe 
defaultLevel Crossings Act 1983
default.
default“We believe that it is neither effective nor efficient for onl
defaulty rail companies to be responsible for managing safety at level crossings.  Decisions about level crossings should involve rail companies, traffic authorities and other relevant organisations as early on as possible. 
default 
defaultRelevant authorities should recognise 
defaultthe wider benefits that safety improvements at level crossings (for example, replacing them with bridges) can bring about, particularly for road users.  If wider benefits can be achieved, the appropriate funding bodies should agree on how the costs of maki
defaultng safety improvements will be met. 
default“We are also committed to helping people understand the importance of the 
defaultsafe use of level cro
defaultssings
default.”
default35.  
defaultIn
default furtherance of the last of these policies. ORR has published a more detailed statement of its 
defaultPolicy on level crossings
default,
default 
defaulttogether with a guide for road (and path) users on 
defaultUsing
default level crossings safely 
defaultand a technical manual entitled 
defaultLev
defaultel Crossings: a guide for managers, designers and operators
default. 
default  
defaultIt is evident that enhancing crossing safety occupies a central place in ORR’s regulatory strategy.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultHow should the legislation governing level crossings be updated?default&#xa0;default36.  
defaultIn June 2008
default the two Law Commissions (i.e. for England &amp; 
defaultWales,
default and for Scotland) announced that at the suggestion of ORR they would jointly be conducting a review of level crossing law.  The exercise has proved complex and time-consuming, and the Commissions’ final p
defaultroposals are not now due to appear until later this autumn.  There has, however, been an extremely thorough process of public consultation as part of the review, to which Passenger Focus and London 
defaultTravelWatch
default have contributed fully.  We do not wish to pre
default-empt the outcome of the Commissions’ work, but we anticipate that it is likely to encompass recommendations relating to (inter alia
default) :
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultHow should public awareness odefaultf safety at level crossings be improved?default37.  
defaultThere are a number of different 
defaulttarget audiences, and the communications strategy must be tailored to their circumstances.  They include, for 
defaultexample :
default&#xa0;
default38.  International Level Crossing Awareness Day, promoted by the International U
defaultnion of Railways, provides an annual opportunity to run co-ordinated awareness-raising events across the network, to maximise the impact of their message.
