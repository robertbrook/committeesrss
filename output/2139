defaultAssociation of Teachers and Lecturers – Written evidencedefault&#xa0;
defaultATL welcomes the opportunity to comment on the draft Deregulation Bill.  
default&#xa0;
defaultClause 2:   Tribunal’s powers to make wider recommendationsdefault&#xa0;defaultATL opposes clause 2 which would remove the power of the Employment Tribunals to issue wider recommendations to employers who a tribunal finds have unlawfully discriminated.
default&#xa0;
defaultPrior to the introduction of this power through S124 (3
default)(
defaultb) of the Equality Act 2010, a tribunal could only provide a remedy to successful claimants if they had left employment (which they have in the vast majority of cases). A tribunal could not recommend that an employer address the root causes of such discrimination. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe government states that it is seeking to repeal this provision due to a fear from employers that recommendations will be inappropriate or excessive. No credible evidence exists to support this argument. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhen ATL responded to the consultation on this issue we were aware of 4 cases where recommendations had been made.
default&#xa0;
defaultThey were:-
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIn 
defaultStone v Ramsay Health Care
default the claimant suffered serious detriments and discriminatory treatment, over a sustained period of time, because she was on maternity leave. Her poor treatment was compounded by the failure of HR and senior managers to understand the relevant statutory rights and the company’s own policies and procedures. The Tribunal recommended that, within six months, the respondent should appoint external consultants to implement a training programme for all managers and HR team members on the respondent’s maternity policies and on the statutory rights of pregnant employees.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis recommendation was clearly proportionate and directly linked to the treatment the claimant had endured.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn 
defaultCrisp v Iceland Foods 
defaulta manager and HR manager in a major retailer ridiculed an employee’s disability, showed poor understanding of mental health issues and failed to offer appropriate support to the claimant during a disciplinary hearing (which the employee had ended up in due to the employer’s own administrative errors). Their treatment of the claimant was considered to have been bad enough to have breached the implied duty of trust and confidence and the tribunal upheld a finding of constructive unfair dismissal. Claims of disability-related harassment, direct disability discrimination and a failure to make reasonable adjustments were also upheld. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe tribunal concluded that management and HR displayed a woeful lack of awareness of mental health issues. Therefore, the tribunal recommended that all management and the relevant HR officers undertook training on disability discrimination with a specific reference to mental health issues. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAgain, these recommendations are proportionate and indeed, it is hoped, would prevent another employee being treated in this manner. As the employee had left employment had it not been for the power to make wider recommendations the tribunal would have been unable to take any steps to prevent such treatment happening again.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn 
defaultAustin v Samuel Grant (North East) Ltd 
defaultthe claimant suffered harassment related to sexual orientation and religion or belief over several months and was held to have been victimised because he was dismissed by one of the perpetrators of the harassment, the managing director of the company, shortly after making a formal complaint. The respondent employer was a small private sector company, employing 12 people, however it was part of a larger group of companies which in total employed 80 people and had an HR manager in post. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOn this occasion the tribunal recommended that the employer update its policies on discrimination and ensure that the directors and managers received training from a reputable source. These recommendations could in no sense be described as inappropriate or excessive.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn 
defaultWhy v Enfield Grammar School
default the claimant was unfairly constructively dismissed and suffered discrimination on the grounds of pregnancy and maternity as she was treated unfavourably in not being scheduled to teach A’ level physics classes. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe tribunal recommended that the senior management team and heads of department be trained in equality law, including the position of women returning from maternity leave. Again, it is difficult to see how the recommendations can be anything other than appropriate and proportionate. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIf tribunals cannot make such recommendations then bad employers will fail to act. The government’s own research back in August 2012 indicated that 54% of employers who were subject to a discrimination claim made at least one change following the case. On the government’s own figures nearly half of employers fail to take any action of their own initiative despite being accused of discrimination. 
default&#xa0;
defaultA decision has been made to repeal these wider recommendations at too early a stage. The power was relatively new when the process of repealing it first started. ATL understands from the Equality Opportunities Review
default  that in 2012 there were 19 cases where wider recommendations were issued. Again, wider recommendations were for training to be undertaken and/or for policies to be reviewed. Such steps are widely regarded as good employment practice so it is, again, difficult to understand a reasonable objection to this power. 
default&#xa0;
defaultClause 31:   Abolition of the office of the Chief Executive of Skills Fundingdefault&#xa0;
defaultATL opposes the abolition of the office of the Chief Executive of Skills Funding as we believe that the transfer of these responsibilities to the Secretary of State undermines the independence of the Skills Funding Agency.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is no evidence that the transference of powers to the Secretary of State will improve transparency or operational efficiency.  We have only to witness the problems of fraud in academies (which have been uncovered by ‘whistleblowers’ and not by Department officials) and the many unanswered questions on funding free schools – both of these sectors run from Whitehall and not by independent or ‘arm’s length’ agencies – to understand that direct 
defaultgovernment interference increases obfuscation and takes Department staff away from the immediate tasks of drawing up appropriate policies for the sector.  
default&#xa0;
defaultEqually, we have not been presented with any evidence that the role of Chief Executive has, in any way, hampered the Secretary of State’s oversight of the skills sector or impeded accountability for the disbursement of skills funding. Unless the government can provide that evidence, ATL firmly believes that the role of Chief Executive remains a key independent check on the fair distribution of millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money.
default&#xa0;
defaultClause 32:   Further and higher education sectors: reduction of burdensdefault&#xa0;defaultThe Draft Deregulation Bill contains the repeal of regulation around the requirement to have teacher qualifications in order to teach in an FE college, to be undergoing probation in order to teach, and for the principal of a college to have specific qualifications. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Bill repeals those sections of the 2002 Education Act and 
defaultare
default contained in Schedule 13, Section 32 of the Bill; as secondary legislation the regulations around teacher qualifications will not require a parliamentary vote and will come into effect in September 2013. The Bill itself will be 
defaultscrutinised
default by a joint committee and will go to parliament in 2014.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe government has deregulated teacher status in academies and free schools and is now proposing to do the same in FE. From September 2013, FE colleges will no longer have to employ qualified teachers in the classroom or workshop. There will no longer have to have a probationary teaching year, that is, one that requires the attaining of teaching qualifications; unless the college deems it necessary.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Draft Deregulation Bill which will go before parliament in 2014 is a part of the government’s ‘red tape challenge.’ This is the idea that there is a lot of time and money being wasted on bureaucratic procedures and criteria. Anything from health and safety to criteria for showing films in a community centre to dealing with household waste are targets for the government. That the deregulation of FE teachers appears amongst a morass of infinitesimal ‘red tape’ cuts around such local and varied concerns is bizarre to say the least.
default&#xa0;
defaultUnderpinning the simple and dangerous idea of the red tape challenge is also the notion that allowing colleges to employ relevant staff in relevant roles will increase college efficiencies and enable a more rapid response to business and employer interests. This has no evidence base, has not been a demand from employers, and runs against developments to 
defaultprofessionalise
default the sector. Indeed, the contradictory policy drivers of deregulation and the establishment of the Education and Training Foundation (ETF) to give momentum to ‘professionalism’ in the sector, following the independent review of professionalism by Lord 
defaultLingfield
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Impact on Practice and Professional Identitydefault&#xa0;
defaultFE colleges are now working within the auspices of the ETF which will set out aspirations for the sector around professionalism (its main remit) and enabling functions such as mechanisms to improve college quality around teaching, CPD, and a range of improvement measures. While a lot of these enablers are under discussion it appears that the ETF want to try and influence colleges in the right 
defaultway, that
default is, aiming to establish high quality teaching and learning.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, following deregulation, what may well happen and would be entirely predictable, is that colleges will ‘cut corners’ in employing qualified staff in a range of ways. A college could:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe variety of roles and interpretations of this ‘black box’ deregulation policy (it doesn’t matter how it’s done as long as it is done) in colleges will mean more restructures, more consultations 
defaultand  negotiations
default around contracts. This is not in the spirit of professionalism that is supposedly the driving force behind the ETF and behind attempts to 
defaultprofessionalise
default the sector.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe demarcation of role and professional identity will be blurred and any ladder of opportunity and skill formation will be lost. Colleges will resort to a variety of cost cutting measures that will slowly but surely undermine the professional status of FE teachers.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Tensions in the Government’s Proposalsdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe government’s proposals are liable to cause some confusion considering that the 
defaultLingfield
default Review’s, establishment of the ETF  to lead on professionalism in the sector and the focus on high quality teaching and learning under the new 
defaultOfsted
default inspection framework would all have suggested a focus on, and an enhancement of, teacher qualifications and standards not their repeal.
default&#xa0;
defaultATL’s response to the Revocation of the Further Education Teachers’ Continuing Professional Development and Registration (England) Regulations 2007 and the Further Education Teachers’ Qualifications (England) Regulations 2007 stated that:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultConclusiondefault&#xa0;
defaultWe believe that deregulation will lead to:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultClause 33: Schools: reduction of burdensdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe proposal to remove the setting of school term dates from local authorities will place an additional burden on schools.  Schools will need to consult with parents and employees on the appropriate term dates which will generate additional bureaucracy for schools.  
default&#xa0;
defaultParents with children at more than one school will need to be involved in multiple consultations which may not result in the schools operating the same term date patterns, leading to childcare concerns.  Also, teachers and other school staff may have pupils at a different school and provisions do not allow for teachers and other school staff to take annual leave during term time.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe removal of the setting of term dates from elected officials removes any democratic accountability for the decisions taken.  Head teachers and governing bodies are not elected by the local community and decisions taken may affect local residents.  For example, the extension of the school week to open on Saturdays may result in additional traffic and noise for local residents.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is also the problem of teachers and other school staff moving from one school to another.  Maintained schools have statutory resignation dates for teaching staff and these will need to be 
defaultaccounted for by schools when setting term dates.  In effect this statutory and contractual resignation date limits the amount of flexibility that schools have.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe proposal to remove the guidance on employing staff in schools will require schools to develop their own procedures.  These procedures are required to ensure that schools’ recruitment and appointment processes are fully compliant with equality legislation and ensure that the right applicant is appointed to the post.  ATL’s concern is that with the removal of the statutory guidance schools will pay for external advice and support from the private sector and thereby reduce the amount of money to be spent directly on education.
