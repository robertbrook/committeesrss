[normal]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]While t
[normal]he Draft Wales Bil
[normal]l 
[normal](2013) 
[normal]covers many important matters, here
[normal] I will concentrate on the proposed reform to National Assembly for Wales (NAW) elections regarding ‘dual candidacy’. I will address two areas: the substance of the proposed reform, and the process of reform.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Dual Candidacy: Substantive Considerations[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]Government of Wales Act 2006 (GOWA) 
[normal]made a change to
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]electoral system 
[normal]used for NAW elections
[normal],
[normal] introducing a provision 
[normal]to 
[normal]prevent
[normal] individuals from standing 
[normal]as candidates
[normal] both in a constituency and for a regional party list.
[normal] Th
[normal]e justification offered for this change 
[normal]in the Government White Paper preceding the 2006 Act
[normal] was 
[normal]that “
[normal]voters are confused and concerned by the way the Assembly’s 
[normal]electoral system permits 
[normal]candidate
[normal]s who lose in a first past the post
[normal] 
[normal]constituency ballot still to become Assembly Members representing the
[normal] 
[normal]same area through the regional list system and competing with
[normal] 
[normal]Assembly Members who defeated them
[normal]” (
[normal]Better Governance for Wales
[normal], 2005, 
[normal]p.3)
[normal]. The White paper
[normal] later 
[normal]also 
[normal]argued that 
[normal]“For losing candidates to become Assembly Members regardless of their constituency election results both devalues the integrity of the electoral system in the eyes of the public and acts as a disincentive to vote in constituency elections” (
[normal]Better Governance for Wales
[normal], 2005, 
[normal]pp.28-29).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In evidence given to th
[normal]is
[normal] committee 
[normal]during consideration of the 2006 Act, 
[normal]I argued against the ban on dual candidacy. I believe that the main argument
[normal]s I developed then remain intact
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, while 
[normal]the arguments used to support the 2006 ban do not stand up to any serious scrutiny, the ban is
[normal] now in place. The question is whether it should remain.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]N
[normal]either 
[normal]AMS 
[normal]with dual candidacy nor 
[normal]AMS 
[normal]without dual candidacy would be my most preferred system for electing the NAW. 
[normal](I am personally a supporter of the Single Transferrable Vote, as advocated by the Richard Commission). However, of these two versions of AMS, I think that one with dual candidacy
[normal] is clearly preferable.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I find it very difficult to see 
[normal]any
[normal] strong principled arguments against dual candidacy
[normal].
[normal] Opponents of dual candidacy have argued that it is inappropriate for those who have already been rejected by the electorate in a particular constituency to nonetheless end up being elected.
[normal] This, I believe, represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the AMS electoral system – at least in its MMP variant. 
[normal]Defeated constituency candidates have, of course, been rejected for that particular constituency. But list seats are a wholly different type
[normal] of mandate, and under MMP these seats are allocated
[normal] 
[normal]in a way that 
[normal]specifically allows for the representation of parties who have 
[normal]not
[normal] been very successful 
[normal]in constituency contests – parties who have, in a sense, been rejected at the constituency level.
[normal] If parties that are defeated at constituency level can still win representation through the list, then it is difficult to see why that should not also apply to individuals.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Banning dual candidacy under the MMM variant of AMS makes a little more sense. 
[normal]Under MMM, t
[normal]he constituency and list elections are wholly separate, with the allocation of list seats unrelated to success in the constituencies. In this context, requiring parties to offer separate groups of candidates for these separate contests perhaps makes some sense. For MMP, it makes no sense whatsoever. This is probably why n
[normal]o countries or regions other than Wales who have 
[normal]implemented the 
[normal]MMP version of AMS have seen any compelling reasons to
[normal] ban dual candidacy
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There are also some good practical reasons for favouring dual candidacy. First, banning dual candidacy helps to create 
[normal]some perverse incentives. 
[normal]In particular, banning dual candidacy makes
[normal] it electorally advantageous for a party’s list 
[normal]candidates 
[normal]to see their 
[normal]constituency candidates
[normal] lose
[normal].
[normal] Similarly, voters wishing to see a particular list candidate elected may have an incentive to vote against that candidate’s party in the constituency election.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Second (and I think, 
[normal]far 
[normal]more importantly), there is a compelling need to ensure that the electoral system does not inhibit the quality of elected representation within the NAW. The Assembly has only 60 members – as many have arg
[normal]ued, a wholly inadequate number. Given the paucity of AMs, we should certainly not impose restrictions on the ability of the parties to ensure that their best people (or at least those whom the parties believe are their best people) are elected to the Assembly. This was a 
[normal]principal
[normal] conclusion 
[normal]of the recent 
[normal]detailed investigation of AMS conducted in New Zealand, where the system was introduced to replace First Past the Post in the 1990s.
[normal] As the final report of this commission stated, “It is both proper and desirable under MMP that political parties can protect good candidates contesting marginal or unwinnable electorates [constituencies] by positioning them high enough on their list to be elected.” (
[normal]Report of the Electoral Commission on the Review of the MMP Voting System
[normal], 2012, 
[normal]p.38)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Thirdly, there are better ways than a ban on dual candidacy to remove the problems that have occasionally been reported 
[normal]with 
[normal]constituency representatives 
[normal]being 
[normal]concerned that list AMs are encroaching on ‘their turf’. One way would be to implement the Richard Commission recommendation of STV.
[normal] STV would remove the problem of there being two categories of elected representative (constituency and list), and place all AMs on the same footing. 
[normal]A second 
[normal]way of addressing the problem 
[normal]might 
[normal]be to elect list AMs from a national list (with a 5% minimum threshold imposed to prevent the system fragmenting excessively
[normal]). This
[normal] 
[normal]would remove
[normal] any sense of local r
[normal]epresentation from list members, and might well therefore reduce the scope for friction between constituency and list members.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]By far the most detailed examination of AMS conducted in recent times 
[normal]is 
[normal]that 
[normal]produced in 
[normal]New Zealand
[normal].
[normal] The
[normal] report
[normal] of this Commission
[normal], which drew on substantial evidence from numerous sources, is an impressive piece of work. On dual candidacy, the report’s conclusion was unambiguous: 
[normal]“Candidates 
[normal]should continue to be able to stand both for an electorate [constituency] seat and be on a party list” (
[normal]Report of the Electoral Commission on the Review of the MMP Voting System
[normal], 2012, 
[normal]p.37).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I see no reason to disagree with this conclusion.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Reforming [bold]the NAW Electoral System[bold]: Improving the Process[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Debates about dual candidacy, both in 2006 and now, raise questions o
[normal]f process as well as substance. The following statements 
[normal]are 
[normal]so obvious as to border on the banal, but they have, I think, important implications for when and how electoral systems are
[normal] reformed
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]From these statements, it follows 
[normal]fairly 
[normal]directly 
[normal]that political p
[normal]arties should be inhibited from 
[normal]changing electoral rules 
[normal]to their own benefit
[normal]. It also follows
[normal] that any 
[normal]changes to 
[normal]the 
[normal]rules 
[normal]that are implemented 
[normal]should command widespread
[normal], cross-party
[normal] support
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Evaluated in relation to these standards, the 
[normal]2006 dual candidacy 
[normal]ban fell a long way short of the ideal.
[normal] 
[normal]The ban 
[normal]was mentioned in the 2005 Labour manifesto, so there was in some sense an electoral mandate for the change.
[normal] 
[normal]However, as described above, 
[normal]the ban was introduced 
[normal]on 
[normal]the 
[normal]basis of very dubious arguments
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]underpinned by 
[normal]little
[normal] or no
[normal] obvious
[normal]ly
[normal] principle
[normal]d conduct. The ban was also introduced
[normal] by one party against widespread opposition: not only 
[normal]that of 
[normal]all
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]other major parties, but also 
[normal]against the 
[normal]views of most other 
[normal]relevant 
[normal]non-partisan actors (
[normal]the 
[normal]Electoral Commission, 
[normal]the 
[normal]E
[normal]lectoral 
[normal]R
[normal]eform 
[normal]S
[normal]ociety
[normal], 
[normal]and most academic commentators
[normal])
[normal].
[normal] This is surely an example
[normal], in terms of the 
[normal]process
[normal] of electoral reform,
[normal] that we 
[normal]in Wales 
[normal]should 
[normal]seek never 
[normal]to repeat.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]One could also question the 
[normal]procedural 
[normal]legitimacy of Westminster continuing
[normal], over the
[normal] long-term
[normal],
[normal] to legislate over electoral arrangements for the NAW, 
[normal]given that the Assembly is 
[normal]a body with its own democratic mandate. Such questions may become particularly stark in the future if one see
[normal]s UK governments elected with
[normal] very limited electoral support from Wales.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I therefore propose that the Wales Bill should be amended to transfer powers over the conduct of NAW elections to the National Assembly. 
[normal]However, to prevent any possibility of manipulation 
[normal]of the electoral rules 
[normal]by 
[normal]any 
[normal]one party, 
[normal]the Bill 
[normal]should 
[normal]also provide 
[normal]for 
[normal]a ‘
[normal]super-majority
[normal]’
[normal] requirement for any change to 
[normal]the 
[normal]current la
[normal]w, with a 
[normal]three-quarters majority 
[normal]of all 
[normal]NAW 
[normal]members 
[normal]needed 
[normal]to approve any changes. This would prevent 
[normal]any 
[normal]single party 
[normal]from changing the electoral system to suit its 
[normal]own interests
[normal]; 
[normal]indeed, a three-quarters majority 
[normal]would 
[normal]also 
[normal]have prevented 
[normal]the 2007-11 
[normal]Labour-Plaid coalition 
[normal]from 
[normal]changing 
[normal]the electoral system 
[normal]without 
[normal]the support of 
[normal]at least one other party.

[normal]).
[normal] Bavaria offers an interesting variant of MMP: it uses open-list MMP, where Bavarians vote for individual party list candidates, not closed party lists. It does not allow for the dual listing of candidate names 
[normal]in the particular single-member constituency in which a candidate stands
[normal], because the constituency candidates' names would be on the ballot papers twice. These candidates, however, 
[normal]must
[normal] be dual candidates and are on their parties' ballot paper lists everywhere else in the electoral region.
[normal] It should be pointed out, for the sake of accuracy that Hungary’s system, and Italy’s between 1993-2005, are
[normal]/were
[normal] only semi-proportional.
[normal] The ban on dual candidacy in Ukraine was introduced prior to the 2002 parliamentary elections – by the same party that 
[normal]not long afterwards 
[normal]attempted to fix the result of the 
[normal]p
[normal]residential election and poison the main opposition candidate.
[normal] In debates preceding the 2006 GOWA, particular attention focused on the example of the 2003 constituency contest in Clwyd West, where three defeated constituency candidates all ended up being elected as list AMs.

[normal] One might reasonably question the extent to which voters had been inf

[normal] 
[normal]The issue was barely discussed in the main Labour manifesto, which stated only that 
[normal]“
[normal]In 
[normal]Wales we will develop democratic devolution by creating a stronger
[normal] 
[normal]Assembly with enhanced legislative powers and a reformed structure
