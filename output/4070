[normal]Written submission from [bold]Certsure [bold]LLP (BRC 58)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]About Certsure[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Certsure LLP is the largest third party certification body in the UK for electrical contractors, with 36,000 regis
[normal]trants with either our NICEIC or
[normal] ELECSA brands. Though we launched in April 2013 as a joint venture between the Electrical Safety Council (ESC) and the Electrical Contractors’ Association (ECA), with the aim of providing funds for these organisations, our roots
[normal] and commitment to raising 
[normal]standards in the industry
[normal] date back 
[normal]112 years to 190
[normal]1
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our responses to questions raised by the Select Committee[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T[bold]he extent to which members of the public are aware of the competent person scheme and that certain domestic electrical works need to be [bold]reviewed and certified to meet the requirements of Building Regulations[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We acknowledge that awareness of Part P amongst consumers requires improvement 
[normal]and 
[normal]t
[normal]hat is why 
[normal]much of our surplus fun
[normal]ds the ESC
[normal]’s campaigns to raise consumer awareness of the value o
[normal]f using a qualified, competent electrician. 
[normal]Moreover
[normal], 
[normal]NICEIC itself has promoted Part P through
[normal] its
[normal] Don’t Take The P 
[normal]and
[normal] ASK campaign
[normal]s
[normal] and the use of registered electricians on 
[normal]high profile 
[normal]programmes such as DIY SOS and 
[normal]Sarah Beeney’s House of Horrors
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Between March 2012 and March 2013 NICEIC
[normal] 
[normal]received 336 items of coverage across national and regional print and broadcast media. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Government could commission a survey to provide a detailed picture of consumer awareness; however, a detailed survey would be 
[normal]costly. The ESC carries out an annual consumer survey that gauges consumer awareness of 
[normal]P
[normal]art 
[normal]P
[normal] and the need to use 
[normal]registered electrician
[normal]s
[normal], the results are used to direct campaign activity throughout the year
[normal]. 
[normal]M
[normal]ore important than 
[normal]ensuring 
[normal]recognition of Pa
[normal]rt P
[normal] by name
[normal], or awareness of the Competent Person Schemes,
[normal] is 
[normal]ensuring wide-spread
[normal] public
[normal] 
[normal]recognition that registration is important for work in the home
[normal] and that 
[normal]e
[normal]lectrical work can
[normal] be unsafe and illegal if 
[normal]not done properly
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There have recently been concerns 
[normal]have been 
[normal]expressed over the potential for confusion amongst consumers as there is more than one register that references electric
[normal]al firms registered 
[normal]under Part P
[normal]. 
[normal]In o
[normal]rder to overcome these concerns
[normal] a meeting 
[normal]has recently
[normal] been held 
[normal]with 
[normal]NAPIT
[normal] and other industry partners
[normal] 
[normal]where it was 
[normal]agreed to seek
[normal] to
[normal] 
[normal]develop
[normal] 
[normal]one easily identifiable quality mark underpinned by a register of all full scope Part P registered electricians. 
[normal](
[normal]See also 
[normal]Section 5).  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I
[normal]n addition to consumer 
[normal]campaigns, the sy
[normal]stem of self-certification 
[normal]contributes to raising awareness. 
[normal]Each year, over one m
[normal]illion electrical installations are notified to Local Authority Building Control by our regi
[normal]stered contractors
[normal]. Every homeowner receives a certificate from 
[normal]C
[normal]ertsure
[normal] 
[normal]plus 
[normal]details on an Insurance Backed Warranty. 
[normal]Customers of 
[normal]NICEIC cont
[normal]r
[normal]actors also benefit from 
[normal]a guarantee of standards 
[normal]and this will be 
[normal]available 
[normal]to ELECSA c
[normal]u
[normal]stomers in 2014 
[normal]along with
[normal] 
[normal]information on using registered electricians and electrical s
[normal]afety from the ESC on any future work carried out.  Across all schemes that equates to over 8 million homes having received suc
[normal]h a certificate
[normal] and safety information
[normal] since 2005
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There is no doubt that certification carries value because some seek to obtain its benefits without submitting themselves to the rigours of assessment. In 
[normal]response
[normal] to these attempts to claim certification through use of the brand
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]C
[normal]ertsure operates a 
[normal]W
[normal]all 
[normal]of 
[normal]S
[normal]hame which displays information on contractors 
[normal]who 
[normal]have 
[normal]never applied or been assessed 
[normal]or where certification has lapsed or been withdrawn.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The extent to which those carrying out electrical works are adequately trained to meet the requirements of the B[bold]uilding Regulations and the extent to which all those working for a company are brought up to the same level of skills[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There are two training routes electrical contractors may take into the industry. However training is just the first step on the path to 
[normal]successful 
[normal]c
[normal]ertification
[normal]. To use an analogy, training and qualification is like taking the driving theory test. The actual driving test assessment with an examiner sitting alongside the candidate is what allows someone to drive a car legally
[normal] and is akin
[normal] to
[normal] the certification assessment of competence.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The traditional route into the industry is a four year apprenticeship with time sp
[normal]lit 
[normal]between academia
[normal] and experience with a sponsoring organisation. On satisfactory completion of studies and an AM2 test
[normal] – a form of practical assessment -
[normal] the apprentice is recognised as an electricia
[normal]n. 
[normal]Originally a
[normal]imed at school leavers
[normal], this route
[normal] is not 
[normal]always 
[normal]realistic or 
[normal]practical for those wishing to change careers
[normal]. As a result, other accelerated routes were develope
[normal]d
[normal]. 
[normal]This
[normal] has caused some dissatisfaction among those who have spent a number of years in the industry
[normal], but it does not mean those routes are without 
[normal]merit
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]All of the qualifications to be eligible to apply for the Part P scheme are detailed in the Minimum 
[normal]Technical Competen
[normal]ce
[normal] (MTC) documents agreed between industry, regulators and Government. 
[normal]This MTC document is also re
[normal]cognised by DECC for the Green Deal S
[normal]chem
[normal]e
[normal]. 
[normal]Since Part P was introduced in 2005, there has been a gradual 
[normal]uplifting 
[normal]of the MTC. From April 
[normal]2013
[normal], the 
[normal]revised electrical MTC 
[normal]will 
[normal]require authorisation and a Level 3 cert
[normal]ificate, which 
[normal]cannot be completed in less than 224 guided learning hours.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Training and qualifications are set by 
[normal]awarding bodies such as City &amp;
[normal] Guilds and EAL
[normal], the specialist a
[normal]warding organisation for the engineering, building services and related sectors
[normal]. Where Certsure offers training and qualifications they do so under license f
[normal]rom the awarding bodies. Tr
[normal]aining 
[normal]is 
[normal]provided separately from the certification functions to 
[normal]ensure
[normal] that
[normal] independence and impartiality
[normal] is maintained
[normal] 
[normal]and kept under review by 
[normal]the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (
[normal]UKAS
[normal])
[normal]. 
[normal]All surpluses are passed back to the ESC and ECA.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Once a contractor achieves the correct level of MTC they may apply to be as
[normal]sessed
[normal] for Part P 
[normal]certification
[normal] which costs
[normal] £
[normal]370
[normal]. 
[normal]Assessment recommendations are: pass; pass subject to providing additional evidence; rejection (don’t reapply); and furt
[normal]her assessment to 
[normal]see additional examples of work. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Over the last 24 months the pass rate 
[normal]has been 81.4%. 6.2% were requested to submit further evidence for review and 12.5% requir
[normal]ed
[normal] an additional visit. The high pass rate is a result of
[normal] a robust pre-assessment process
[normal] which means only those with a good chance of passing put themselves forward 
[normal]or are put forward 
[normal]for assessment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Having passed the assessment,
[normal] 
[normal]a 
[normal]Q
[normal]ualified 
[normal]S
[normal]upervisor (QS)
[normal] has ultimate 
[normal]responsibility 
[normal]for signing o
[normal]ff work so in the event that there is an incident caused by bad electrical work the
[normal]y 
[normal]will be held accountable. Certsure 
[normal]makes very clear the consequences for, and responsibilities of, the QS
[normal].  Following a tragic accident 
[normal]in 2007, 
[normal]caused by 
[normal]a contractor failing to test and inspect properly
[normal],
[normal] Certsure
[normal] 
[normal]wrote 
[normal]to every QS
[normal] to remind them of their responsibilities
[normal]. S
[normal]eminars
[normal] are held at industry 
[normal]events
[normal] and NICEIC 
[normal]&amp;
[normal] ELECSA live events to educate and update QSs on their responsibilities. 
[normal]The QS system helps ensure 
[normal]safe working practices are 
[normal]i
[normal]nstitutionalized in a 
[normal]company 
[normal]and 
[normal]not just left to an individual.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Upon its introductio
[normal]n, Part P 
[normal]cause
[normal]d mixed feelings within the trade, with those who had been involved in the industry for a long time questioning the need to register. However
[normal],
[normal] Certsure is confident that only those contractors who
[normal] can demonstrate their knowledge and understa
[normal]nding of the regulations through a robust assessment will 
[normal]secure certification
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. [bold]              [bold]The extent to which those carrying out electrical works, to which the Building[bold] [bold]Regulations apply, review or have their work reviewed to ensure that it meets the [bold]requirements of the Regulations[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]All Part P registrants are 
[normal]currently 
[normal]required to be assessed annually through rigorous assessment of their work and knowledge and understanding of the Wiring Regulations. 
[normal]There are over 40,000 contractors registered on Comp
[normal]etent Persons Schemes and their notifiable work is tracked and reported to local authorities. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Certsure and its previous entities have undertaken assessments under UKAS accreditation standard EN45011 since 2002
[normal] (NICEIC)
[normal] and 2008
[normal] (ELECSA)
[normal]. 
[normal]We believed thi
[normal]s was essential if contractors were to have fai
[normal]th in the system. Not all Compet
[normal]ent Person Schemes are currently UKAS accredited but they are required to achieve this by
[normal] June
[normal] 2014
[normal] and we welcome this.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Assessments are 
[normal]conducted annually through 
[normal]a minimum o
[normal]f 
[normal]half day of questioning and observation in the presence of a Qualified Supervisor (QS), whose responsibility it is to supervise and sign off the work of others.
[normal] Additional assessment time is required where there 
[normal]are multiple locations
[normal] or additional QSs
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A
[normal]ssessment
[normal]s start
[normal] with time spent at the contractor’s office or home 
[normal]where 
[normal]insurance details, complaints system, contracts old and new, electrical certificates, health and safety policy
[normal],
[normal] standards
[normal] 
[normal]and access to appropriate test equipment to carryout test
[normal]ing 
[normal]are reviewed
[normal]. Following this, the assessor and QS will review 
[normal]a 
[normal]sample of work that 
[normal]is
[normal] representative of the contractors work activities
[normal] and are 
[normal]chosen
[normal] by the assessor
[normal]. At each location the assessor will ask question
[normal]s
[normal] of the QS about the installation a
[normal]gainst the written specification and the wiring regulations. The QS will show examples of his work and demonstrate how the installation complies with the
[normal] requirements
[normal]. 
[normal]The QS will also be asked to demonstrate testing and safe isolation.
[normal] 
[normal]We are consiste
[normal]ntly
[normal] reviewing the standards QSs
[normal] need to reach and these have recently been upgraded.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]Government has previously explored the robustness of the QS system and found it to be satisfactory. 
[normal]Moreover, it means that the Competent Person Scheme covers much more 
[normal]than mere technical competence such as complaints, insurance, health and safety
[normal], management
[normal] etc
[normal].
[normal], unlike GasSafe which solely considers the 
[normal]gas 
[normal]technical competence of the individuals
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Finally, assessments are conducted by assessors
[normal], the majority of whom
[normal] are electrical engineers
[normal] who are themselves required to have achieved a level of competence in excess of that which they are required to assess. 
[normal]Our 
[normal]a
[normal]ssessors
[normal] 
[normal]are required to update their 
[normal]knowledge on a regular basis
[normal],
[normal] as standards change
[normal]. They do so 
[normal]throu
[normal]gh a mixture of CPD, face to face meetings, regional conferences, technical guidance and
[normal] policy updates
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The competence of the assessors is reviewed annually by UKAS.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We have investigated 
[normal]a 
[normal]report 
[normal]in one of the responses 
[normal]of
[normal] 
[normal]a four minute assessment.  
[normal]Our 
[normal]assessment
[normal] report shows that 
[normal]during this assessment 
[normal]we
[normal] assessed a rewire at one address and an additional circuit at another.
[normal] 
[normal]The contractor in question was deregistered from NICEIC for non-payment of fees in February 2012, but unfortunately continues to d
[normal]isplay the NICEIC logo on their website. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Furthermore, we are happy to write to the 
[normal]S
[normal]elect 
[normal]C
[normal]ommittee in specific detail on any evidence that has been submitted where NICEIC and ELECSA have been mentioned.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.9.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We have a team 
[normal]which
[normal] 
[normal]handle
[normal]s
[normal] complaints resolution and provide
[normal]s
[normal] support to consumers. If we receive complaints which are upheld then the relevant information will be discussed with the 
[normal]contractor either at the next visit or immediate steps will be taken if the complaint is serious
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]UKAS accreditation is only awarded to third party certification bodies that meet and continue to meet the requirements of EN45011. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]EN45011 covers much more than mere technic
[normal]al competence 
[normal]and includes issues such 
[normal]as complaints, insurance 
[normal]governance
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Certification bodies must demonstrate they are independent of any interests that could affect the certification outcome and must be impartial in all of their certification decisi
[normal]ons
[normal]. To achieve this Certsure has a Certification Council made up of industry stakeholders representing users, regulators and the trade. The Council has oversight of certification
[normal] 
[normal]activities and ensures Certsure is independent
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]impartial and operat
[normal]ing
[normal] in a
[normal] way that meets EN45011. 
[normal]The 
[normal]C
[normal]ouncil can raise issues directly with the Certsure Board
[normal] and 
[normal]UKAS as 
[normal]necessary
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The
[normal] assessment outlined 
[normal]in Section 3 is
[normal] thorough and it 
[normal]is not possible to pass if the c
[normal]ontractor is unable to
[normal] demonstrate how to work safely. Of those undertaking assessment, a number fail
[normal]. They are 
[normal]then offered examples of areas on which they need to improve.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Furthermore, contractors are required by law to notify 
[normal]s
[normal]cheme operators of any electrical works which 
[normal]they themselves deem as notifiable. T
[normal]his is done v
[normal]ia an online tool which captures t
[normal]he information requested by 
[normal]Local Authority Build
[normal]ing Control and sends 
[normal]this information electronically to the correct L
[normal]ocal 
[normal]A
[normal]uthority
[normal]. 
[normal]A
[normal] certificate
[normal] is then sent
[normal] to the hom
[normal]eowner confirming who did the work and that the contactor has made a declaration that the works comply with Parts 4 and 7 of the Building Regulations. Homeowners may be asked for this information by a conveyancer if they sell their property.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I
[normal]ndependent verification
[normal] of 
[normal]assessment reports and 
[normal]certification recommendations
[normal] 
[normal]is
[normal] 
[normal]conducted by
[normal] qualified and competent 
[normal]staff 
[normal]to 
[normal]determine whether the report is sufficiently detailed
[normal] and
[normal] if the assessment recommendation should be upheld or if further evide
[normal]nce or assessment visits are required. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]From June 2014, UKAS will accredit all scheme operators. 
[normal]UKAS are able to spot check our operation without giving any notice. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]5.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our scheme authorisations from 
[normal]D
[normal]CLG and also compliance with UKAS accreditation (EN45011) require us to publish / make available a register of our contractors. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As stated in 1.3 
[normal]we
[normal] have agreed to seek to develop one easily identifiable quality mark, underpinned by a register of all full scope Part P registered electricians, that provides a single point of reference for consumers to refer to when seeking an electri
[normal]cian to do electrical work in their home.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is anticipated that the proposal will include all licensed Part P 
[normal]scheme operators
[normal] in England and Wales who meet the new scheme requirements in line with DCLG’s timeline, and would lead to the removal from the
[normal] market place of both existing registers (ElectricSafe Register and the El
[normal]ectrical Safety Register).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]W
[normal]e 
[normal]have written to the 
[normal]Department
[normal] setting out our intentions and seeking Government support in this regard.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We are keen to work closely with both the Comm
[normal]ittee and the Department on the development of a new 
[normal]mark
[normal], to ensure 
[normal]it meets the objectives of policy makers, and will keep all parties informed of ongoing developments.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, we maintain that competition and choice is fundamentally good for the 
[normal]electrician and homeowner. Competition and the need to distinguish ourselves from others encouraged us to be amongst the first to seek UKAS accreditation, and dr
[normal]i
[normal]ve up standards. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Contractors need us to ensure we promote them and choose schemes on the bas
[normal]is of which brand gets them 
[normal]work. Competition ensures 
[normal]more promotion to consumers. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Behavioural change and an increase in standards 
[normal]are
[normal] 
[normal]best achieved by using both sanctions and incentives.
[normal] 
[normal]A competitive landscape creates the business benefits of 
[normal]registration which complements the legislative framework of Part P
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Certsure 
[normal]is
[normal] 
[normal]concerned by 
[normal]some of the 
[normal]c
[normal]laims of corporate greed
[normal] which have been put forward by respondents
[normal]. 
[normal]Certsure LLP is wholly owned by the 
[normal]ESC and the ECA
[normal]. 
[normal]Initial 
[normal]assessment and
[normal] annual registration fees
[normal] – one of the smaller costs faced by a contractor 
[normal]compared to other operating costs 
[normal]-
[normal] 
[normal]are

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The current accreditation scheme,
[normal] built on the 
[normal]1956 model, 
[normal]provides rob
[normal]ust standards for the industry. When the Committee reviewed Part P i
[normal]t stated
[normal]:
[normal] “
[normal]A 
[normal]strengthened Part P Building Regulations regime would be better than a fully mandatory scheme at the present time”. Like 
[normal]the Committee
[normal], we do not believe 
[normal]the review of Part P in 2012 and the reduction of notifications in kitchens and bathrooms 
[normal]will benefit
[normal] electrical safety and may present a real
[normal] safety issue for householders. W
[normal]e do not believe there is any evidence to suggest that the initial conclusion of the 
[normal]Committee
[normal] should be revised.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We have a culture of continuous improvement and welcome steps taken
[normal] but not yet fully implemented to raise standards further in Part P. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Contractor feedback 
[normal]is important 
[normal]and 
[normal]we take it
[normal] seriously
[normal]. However, 
[normal]we are confident of the integrity of the 
[normal]many examples of electricians who 
[normal]have volunteered their satisfaction with 
[normal]t
[normal]he value of registration
[normal].
