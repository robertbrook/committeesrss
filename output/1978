defaultDr Amanda J defaultMeikledefault – Written evidencedefault&#xa0;
defaultI am writing to express my deep concern over the introduction of a duty on persons exercising certain regulatory functions to "have 
defaultregard
default" to the desirability of "promoting economic growth". I am a freelance researcher and have drawn on two peer-reviewed papers to which I have access. I am a microbiologist by training, not an economist, but this information is out there and I felt drawn to submit something to this consultation, even if it is disregarded as irrelevant.
default&#xa0;
defaultI have answered the questions below as numbered in your call for evidence found here: http://www.parliament.uk/documents/joint-committees/draft-deregulation-bill/callforevidencedraftdereg.pdf
default&#xa0;
defaultGeneraldefault3. 
defaultAre the changes proposed in the draft Bill evidence-based and have any risks associated with the changes been taken adequately into account?
default&#xa0;
defaultFinding evidence on which to base the promotion of economic growth is questionable. Ecological economists, such as O’Hara
default, argue that the industrial system, which has growth at its heart, cannot persist based on the laws of thermodynamics. Now whether the officers reading this submission know about the laws of thermodynamics or not, they apply to human society as well as to every other process on the planet (and beyond). Economists with a far better understanding of such matters than 
defaultI,
default have been trying to raise awareness of the problems of economic growth for decades (e.g. Meadows et 
defaultal's
default Limits to Growth). All economic growth requires the use of non-renewable natural resources - and, increasingly, the unsustainable use of renewable resources such as water. This has to change and such change has to happen at all levels of society, hence my submission.
default&#xa0;
defaultTo advocate economic growth as a default is to completely ignore/deny the problems being faced by society today from resource depletion, pollution and climate change. This Bill is an opportunity to consider how we might function without continuous economic growth, yet it promotes it with no regard to evidence against it. I am not naïve enough to expect any government to speak against economic growth but 
defaultwhy does this draft bill introduce a duty to "have regard" to the desirability of "promoting economic growth" at all
default? 
default&#xa0;
defaultA duty to have regard to the desirability of promoting economic growthdefault17. To what extent do the Government’s existing powers of direction over regulators already provide the ability to guide regulators towards the importance of promoting economic growth? Is this legislation necessary?
default&#xa0;
defaultFor reasons given above, this legislation is unnecessary as promoting economic growth is paramount in current government (and business) philosophies. Furthermore, economic growth does not necessarily mean increased well-being for people. Officers implementing the Bill may find conflicts if they "have a duty to have regard to the desirability of promoting economic growth" as it is not always desirable. Should schools be bulldozed for a new shopping mall, for instance?
default&#xa0;
default18. Will the introduction of a duty to have 
defaultregard
default to “promoting economic growth” compromise the independence of regulators? What additional safeguards are required to ensure that the introduction of such a duty will not compromise the independence of a regulator?
default&#xa0;
defaultYes, because there may be occasions where promoting economic growth is not beneficial, or is the wrong choice. I do not believe it is a case of introducing 'safeguards'. This clause should be omitted.
default&#xa0;
default21. How might the extent to which a regulator has fulfilled, or breached, the duty be ascertained?
default&#xa0;
defaultShould the clause remain, the fulfilment of duty should be assessed on social welfare and environmental integrity, not GDP and profits. Consider employment - there is a big difference between people having a relatively secure job with good working conditions and people having no choice but to take part-time jobs with no rights (e.g. zero-hours contracts) and no permanency. Both are seen as 'employment' - it's not the words in a document which count but the values of those making decisions based on such advice.  
default&#xa0;
default22. How can the likely financial and economic impact of the proposed duty be assessed?
default&#xa0;
defaultAs another ecological economist, Clive 
defaultSpash
default says, "Traditional pro-growth policies fail to address the problems humanity faces, 
defaultthe
default necessary transition nor the nature of widespread environmental change we are undertaking. We have to ask, 'economic activity for what?'" 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have to know what economic growth is for before we can impose a duty to have regard to its desirability. Therefore, this clause should be omitted.
