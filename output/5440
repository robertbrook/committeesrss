[normal]Executive summary [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]NDCS is concerned that Ofsted inspections and its annual report do not sufficiently emphasise the importance of local authority specialist SEN support services for deaf children. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A failure to inspect or scrutinise or even comment on these services sends 
[normal]a signal that these services are not important, when many deaf children and their families rely on these services to achieve good outcomes.

[normal]“There was limited strategic overview and no systematic approach across all services to evaluate the quality of services and their impact on improving the lives
[normal] of deaf children.”
