"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Northern Film &amp; Media Limited [FBB0048]&#xa0;\nHow well has the BBC performed in the current Charter period in achieving its mission and public purposes?In particular the Public Purpose stating\n1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNorthern Film &amp; Media was established in 2002 and is now based in Gateshead providing a creative industries development agency role for companies based in North East England across Film, TV and digital.\n&#xa0;\n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDuring this time NFM has enjoyed a strong collaborative partnership with the BBC and latterly BBC North in Salford.  We have found the BBC to be instrumental in forging partnerships in the region with a range of organisations, ourselves included.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nParticularly important to us is to ensure that the North East achieves a fair level of representation across the BBC, both on screen and behind the scenes in terms of job opportunities for North East personnel, crew and freelancers.  We wish to ensure that North East-based production companies have the opportunity to pitch their projects, that production takes place in the region and that North East facility companies are better positioned to secure contracts.\n&#xa0;\n4)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOver the years NFM and the BBC have carried out a number of initiatives to develop and nurture talent in the region.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nExamples of this work are BBC writer’s initiatives that have included regional talent and indirectly, BBC comedy “Hebburn” was developed from sessions attended by its North East writer Jason Cook.\n&#xa0;\n6)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWith the BBC we ran a comedy initiative “Jesting About” featuring North East writers and talent who were given the opportunity to air their work on BBC local radio.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe BBC is keen to promote the North East as a Centre of Excellence for Children’s Drama with “Wolfblood” and “Dumping Ground” currently produced here, following on from “Tracey Beaker” and before that, the long-running “Byker Grove”\n&#xa0;\n8)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis year, in partnership with the BBC, we have held a regional Insight Day at which the BBC sought to develop partnerships with regional organisations with a view to increasing the region’s exposure on the BBC.  Plans are afoot with the BBC’s Events Team to develop the strongest North East ideas for possible transmission.\n&#xa0;\n9)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFinally, in terms of broadcast production the region is currently particularly well-served with the aforementioned Children’s dramas “Wolfblood” and Dumping Ground”, “Inspector George Gently”, shot in Durham, “The Paradise” in Chester le Street and “Hebburn’s” use of outside locations.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n10)\n \nNorthern Film &amp; Media remains resolute in its aims to encourage the BBC to increase its regional presence and we believe the BBC shares this ambition.\n&#xa0;\nJohn Tulip\nManaging Director\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
