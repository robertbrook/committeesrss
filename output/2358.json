"&#xa0;\nRoad Safety GB – Written evidence&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThank you for your request for the views of Road Safety GB on the proposed \nlifting  of\n the requirement to notify the Secretary of State before a pedestrian crossing is removed.\n&#xa0;\nOur view is that, provided that stakeholder and local consultation continues to be a requirement, this proposal will have no negative effect on road safety. It will be one less administrative task for all \nconcerned, that\n has no safety benefit, which we welcome.\n&#xa0;\nYours,\nHonor Byford\nVice Chair\nRoad Safety GB\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
