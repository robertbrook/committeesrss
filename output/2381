defaultOpen Country – Written evidencedefault&#xa0;defaultProposed clauses  in the forthcoming Deregulation Bill
default&#xa0;
defaultI write to offer the support of my disability charity for two proposed items in the forthcoming Deregulation Bill
default&#xa0;
defaultThe first is that all unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs) and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads (UCRs) should be recognised as not being part of the ordinary roads network, and should be re-classified as Restricted Byways. We feel it is so important that recreational motor vehicles be thus banned from our network of green lanes, as they cause massive environmental degradation and inconvenience for other network users, not least of all many disabled people.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe second is that when a local authority declines to impose a Traffic Regulation Order (TRO) that is widely supported y the public, there should be a right of appeal, either to an independent inspector or a magistrate. This would avoid the current state of affairs where some faint-hearted local authorities choose to ignore the wishes of the vast majority of green lanes users by failing to prohibit recreational vehicle use.
default&#xa0;
defaultOur charity takes disabled people out into the countryside and we are often faced with problems caused by recreational motor vehicles. More often than not this takes the form of impoverished access conditions through badly eroded path surfaces. Occasionally however, it can take the form of dangerous and intimidation driving which jeopardises the safety of our members.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe fully support the formal submissions made by The Green Lanes Environmental Action Group (GLEAM), the Green Lanes Protection Group(GLPG) the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance (PDGLA) and the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance (YDGLA).
default&#xa0;
defaultI do hope that these points can be included in the forthcoming Bill.
