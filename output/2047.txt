[[[Safety]]]

[[[Level Crossings]]]&#xa0;Nevertheless, accidents have occurred at level crossings on heritage railways and require continued and constant vigilance to improve safety.Â  Maintenance of the highway, warning signs, and regular cutting back of vegetation to improve sightlines are all examples of work undertaken to keep both rail and road users safe, although not all highway authorities appear to recognise that some of this work is their responsibility.
