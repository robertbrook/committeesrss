[[[ Police &amp; Crime Commissioner]]]

[[[ for Sussex [CST0051]]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;Further to the Public Administration Select Committee Inquiry into Crime Statistics, Katy Bourne, the Sussex Police &amp; Crime Commissioner, would like to make the following response.&#xa0;

[[[What, if any, targets do you set for your]]]

[[[ police force? What impact do you think this has on police recording crime practices?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Sussex Police Authority had 18 targets in their 2012/2013 Local Policing Plan. To an extent these targets dictated specific activity and unhelpfully incentivised police officers to pursue particular outcomes and crime types ahead of others. By contrast, the Commissioner’s Police &amp; Crime Plan has removed these targets and the associated performance pressures they bring. There is now an emphasis on strengthening police officer discretion to focus activity around local priorities which differ by district and division. &#xa0;Mrs Bourne acknowledges that this approach empowers local District Commanders and staff with greater discretion to exercise their professional judgement to ensure that offenders are dealt with by the most appropriate disposal available, in the knowledge that no one outcome is favoured over others. Strengthening police officer and staff discretion should in turn promote a more victim-focussed approach, determined to provide a better service to victims of crime by removing perverse incentives for forces to record and pro-actively pursue certain crimes on the basis of locally-set detection targets, and encouraging officers and staff to consider the needs of victims, and the potential for engaging them in the process. &#xa0;The Commissioner appreciates that targets can provide a useful method of measuring performance in terms of evaluating the effectiveness and appropriateness of the allocation of resources across different activities and crime types. However, local priorities will vary from one district to another (as described above). It is also worth emphasising that Sussex Police are still monitoring their performance internally which is set out in their Operational Delivery Plan and the Commissioner keeps a close watch on this performance.&#xa0;

[[[How do you assure yourself that the recorded crime figures for your area are correct? To what extent can you trust the crime statistics for your area?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The Commissioner is reassured that the crimes in Sussex are being recorded and categorised correctly which ensures integrity of the data.&#xa0;Mrs Bourne has recently met with Superintendent Samantha Coates, Force Crime Intelligence, and Mr George Welch, Force Crime Registrar to discuss recorded crime in Sussex. The Commissioner will continue to closely monitor this area at her monthly Performance &amp; Accountability Meetings (PAMs) with the Chief Constable. These PAMs are webcast online and available to view on www.sussex-pcc.gov.uk.                 &#xa0;Mrs Bourne appreciates that Sussex Police have endeavoured to improve the integrity of their recorded crime by changing the culture within the Force from the top down (including the removal of targets). This has also included improving the systems and processes in place, including the implementation of Niche, which brings together all of the crime data and information in one place and enables officers and staff to work with increased flexibility. In addition, officers and staff have been provided with further training to improve their skill levels using the new systems and processes, together with increased discretion for officers and staff. &#xa0;The Commissioner is confident that the crime recording practices within Sussex Police are increasingly victim-focussed because every report is treated as a crime in the first instance, until it is proved otherwise. However, there is an obvious continuum between what is and what is not a crime and elements of subjectivity, in between. This ensures that officers and staff are not fixated on chasing obtuse targets but there are risks associated with increased officer and staff discretion which need to be managed accordingly.&#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;&#xa0;
