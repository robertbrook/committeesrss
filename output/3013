defaultExamination of WitnessdefaultWitness
default:
default 
defaultSir David Higginsdefault, Chief Executive, Network Rail, gave evidence
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ1 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultGood afternoon, Sir David. Welcome to the Transport Select Committee. Could you give us your name and position for our records, please?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: David Higgins, Chief E
defaultxecutive of Network Rail.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ2 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Sir David, it hasn’t escaped our notice 
defaultthat you are shortly to become c
defaulthair of High Speed 2. Before we ask you questions about your current position
default,
default I would like to raise some issues to do with High Speed 2. I am sure you are well aware of the mounting criticisms that have been voiced of High Speed 2 in recent weeks. In view of that background what do you see as your main challenges in taking up your new role?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: I should start by saying that I don’t t
defaultake up the role until January, t
defaultherefore I have not been directly involved to date. When the business case is fully and transparently discussed in Parliament, as it should be, I think it will be very strong. It is a national project. It is a long-term project that deals with 
defaulta
default long-t
defaulterm problem of public transport
default that we have had in this nation for a long time. We use traditional methodologies of assessing it, and to date the methodology cuts out any growth three years after the project has finished. I suppose that is a commentary on the methodology. It might also be an indicator as to why it is very difficult to get major infrastructure in key parts of this country. When the full facts are laid out
default,
default together with what I consider to be very conservative figures on growth of about 2% per annum assumed in the model going forward
default,
default until it is capped three years after it has finished—which is less than half of what we are currently achieving—I think it will be a very strong case. I don’t think that will become the issue.
default              
defaultWhat will be the issue is giving the public and Parliament confidence that this major investment of public money can be done responsibly, in the most cost-effective way and that the communities to the north a
defaultnd adjacent to the railway line
default in the regions benefit the most. They should benefit fr
defaultom schools, jobs, businesses 
defaultand services 
defaultthat 
defaultare freed up on the existing line. 
defaultI am not sure we have done the right job, or the fullest job, of explaining that to those communities, listening to them and then delivering that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ3 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default If the job of explaining that has not been done, who is to blame for that?  Should Ministers or High Speed 2 have been doing it?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: No one is to blame for it. It is a very complex project. 
defaultA project of this size and scale
default is going through a very complex parliamentary process. We need to explain to members of the public
default, first,
default why a parliamentary process, 
defaultwhich
default will probably finish on the current schedule in 2020, takes so long, what is involved in that process and 
defaultalso 
defaultthe benefits.
default 
defaultTo date everyone is focused on speed. Speed is an interesting part of 
defaulti
defaultt, but for me it has never been about speed. It has been about capacity. The bottom 
defaultend
default of the West Coast is full. We know that now; we can’t put any more train paths on it. Virgin applied to have one this year. Regrettably
default,
default we turned down two paths from 
defaultShrewsbury
default and 
defaultBlackpool
default. We know the bottom end is full, but the main benefit I see is connectivity. 
defaultIt is connectivity from the north. 
defaultThere is a north-south connectivity
default,
default but there is also a connectivity betwee
defaultn the great cities of the north, which w
defaulte need to explain and show the benefits of. We also need to get the maximum benefit from what this will do to regeneration in major cities in the north. We need to explain how that will happen now and that these cities won’t in some way be blighted for years to come. It should be quite the contrary; it should be a fantastic opportunity 
defaultthat
default we need to explain to business.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ4 default&#xa0; 
defaultKaren Lumley:default What made you want to take on the role? How do you think you are going to do a different job of changing people’s hearts and minds?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: I became concerned that a project 
defaultthat
default has always had bipartisan political support was becoming a bit of a political football. It is too important for that. It is a national project 
defaultthat
default is crucially important for the nation
default to spread wealth but
default also crucially important for the railway infrastructure. We cannot keep going on patching up the existing one for the next 50 years.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ5 default&#xa0; 
defaultKaren Lumley:default 
defaultHow are you going to do it differently 
defaultfrom
default what HS2 have been doing so far?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: I will just build on what they have done. If you look at what they have had to do in the last few years to get to the stage where the Bill will be lodged in Parliament within the next six weeks, 
defaultit
default is an amazing achievement. It is way ahead of where Crossrail got to. I know Doug Oakervee very well and have enormous respect for him. I want 
defaulta
default smooth baton change between Doug and myself so that I can pick up the work that he has done so well to date.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ6 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Sanders:default You mentioned connectivity
default,
default but h
defaultow does connectivity in this project help the far south-
defaultwest of 
defaultEngland
default, which a
defaultt the moment 
defaulthas
default some of the slowest journey times and the hig
defaulthest fares?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: High Speed 2 is not a case of either/or. It is not a case of either/or even on the traditional line
default—
defaultthe West Coast. We will spend more money in the 20 years that High Speed 2 will be built on upgrading the existing network
default than we will on High Speed 2. O
defaultn the Western there is a £7 billion project, 
defaulton 
defaultwhich I am sure you are well briefed, which takes electrification to 
defaultCardiff
default and then on to 
defaultSwansea
default and the valleys. It will bring it at the moment down to 
defaultBristol
default,
default but that will improve line speed on the whole section on the Western not only by electrification—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ7 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Sanders:default Could I ask you to sto
defaultp there and maybe look at a map and I will ask the question again?
default How does it hel
defaultp connectivity in the far south-
defaultwest of 
defaultEngland
default?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: Within the far south-
defaultwest
default,
default it is subject to further investment no doubt both in this control period but also in the next control period. It means 
defaultthat its core route, so
default moving from the 
defaultThames
default 
defaultValley
default and areas t
defaulthrough to 
defaultBristol
default further south,
default 
defaultt
defaulthat line now—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ8 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Sanders:default 
defaultSorry—
defaultI
default am talking about the far south-
defaultwest. 
defaultBristol
default is the south
default midlands and not the far south-
defaultwest.
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: 
defaultOkay. The
default major investment programme 
defaultat the moment, 
defaultwith a lot of work at 
defaultBristol
default and Bristol Temple Meads, means that—
defaultMr Sanders:default That is not the far south-
defaultwest.
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: —is where we stop, if we carve off south-
defaultwest 
defaultEngland
default at that point. 
defaultThen w
defaulte will look at continuing improvements. In fact we have already put a proposal through to the Department 
defaultof how we put
default more investment down to Exeter and the whole areas 
defaultthat were 
defaultsubstantially impacted, connectivity-wise, during the 
defaultwettest summer we had last year—what can be done to make sure that that area is not so exposed and not cut off as it was last time—and w
defaulte have put a case through to the Department to consider 
defaultthat
default.
default              defaultMr Sanders:default That is just protecting existing connectivity. It is not improving the connectivity in the area.
default              defaultChair:default I am sure we will be returning to this at another date, Mr Sanders.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ9 default&#xa0; 
defaultMartin Vickers:default Sir David, you mentioned connectivity between the
default major cities of the north and h
defaultow it will help regeneration. Could you expand a little on how you think it will help the more provincial towns in the north, in terms of freeing up capacity so that they too may have more direct services to 
defaultLondon
default and other major cities?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: That is a huge opportunity. Everyone talks about Leeds to 
defaultLondon
default or 
defaultBirmingham
default to 
defaultLondon
default. The other day I went to 
defaultMilton Keynes
default. I had business in 
defaultYork
default. It was quicker to come down to Euston, walk across to King’s Cross, have a cup of coffee and then go back up to 
defaultYork
default. That 
defaultis actually
default three and a half hours if you go the other way
default. That will be cut dramatically—more than halved
default.
default              
defaultThere are at least a dozen major cities in the midlands where their journeys between cities will be much better. The huge benefit, which I don’t think we have properly set out to the public, is what it doe
defaults in relieving the main line—
defaultthe West Coast. By having 18 
defaultnew train paths on the new high-
defaultspeed line
default,
default it means that we can fre
defaulte up the West Coast for freight of course, but t
defaulthat provides huge capacity
default to look at services
default. 
default              
defaultAt the moment I travel on London Midland services quite a lot. I stand quite a lot as I go into 
defaultCoventry
default or 
defaultBirmingham
default,
default and not even in peak hours. There will be more stopping services between the cities of 
defaultCoventry
default, Rugby, 
defaultMilton Keynes
default and all these areas. There will be an improved service from Stafford and 
defaultLiverpool
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ10 default&#xa0; 
defaultMartin Vickers:default Would you expand a bit on the East Coast too? I represent the Cleethorpes constituency in northern 
defaultLincolnshire
default. As the Prime Minister pointed out in his speech to the conference, northern 
defaultLincolnshire
default and the 
defaultHumber
default area is a major centre for the renewables sector. 
defaultPotential investors are looking for connectivity not just to 
defaultLondon
default but to other major cities. Would you anticipate that towns such as 
defaultGrimsby
default, Cleethorpes and 
defaultScunthorpe
default could also gain additional services?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: Yes. The key thing about this design 
defaultthat
default I find most attractive is that it is not a replacement for the West Coast. It is a central spine. It connects to the East Coast and it connects into Sheffield to the 
defaultEast Midlands
default services. The real challenge and the crucial part on the East
default Coast is the two-track railway, which
default is incredibly restrictive because we are mixing freight, commuter and high speed. It will release a lot more services
default,
default and those who come on at 
defaultYork
default or 
defaultLeeds
default of course can divert on t
defaulto the high-speed 
defaultline.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ11 default&#xa0; 
defaultGraham Stringer:default When Philip Hammond was Secretary of State
default he had a rule of thumb that the rate of investment in High Speed 2 should be 
defaultroughly 
defaultthe rate of investment that 
defaultthere 
defaulthad been in Crossrail, which was about £2 billion a year. Do you think that is a reasonable rule of thumb
default,
default or could High Speed 2 be built more quickly
default,
default because it is going to give us significant economic benefits?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: If you are in the north you will want to see the benefits earlier. I don’t think people will want to wait until 2032 or 2035 to see the benefits. That is something I will look at closely.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ12 default&#xa0; 
defaultGraham Stringer:default One of the things this Committee recommended in its report on High Speed 2 was that
default,
default as well as building from south to north
default,
default it should look at building from north to south. Would you consider that? Do you think that is a sensible recommendation?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: We should certainly look at it. 
defaultAt the moment it is driven by the legislative process. The current timetable has the Royal Assent for the second stage in 2020. That is a long way from now. You could build stage one of High Speed 2 between now a
defaultnd Royal Assent for the second B
defaultill. Surely we can make that quicker, if we can. All options are open.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ13 default&#xa0; 
defaultGraham Stringer:default You mentioned the methodology for the assessment of High Speed 2. Could you expand on that a little? Do you think the methodology for assessing costs and benefits 
defaultis faulty at all—
defaultor 
defaultcould 
defaultit 
defaultbe improved?
default That is probably a better way of putting it.
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: Let us 
defaultjust 
defaultlook at history. The Jubilee Line extension did not pass 
defaulta
default value-for-money test. Thankfully it was built. High Speed 1 nearly fell over but for the Secretary of State intervening in the project. Crossrail 1 and Thameslink are both 20 years late because they failed value-for-money tests at the tim
defaulte; and clearly they don’t 
defaultnow. 
default              
defaultWhile I have not gone through the value for money in detail, 
defaultit is probably right to put in 
defaultthe growth as
defaultsumption of 2%, 
defaultthough it is very conservative
default, of w
defaulthere we are cu
defaultrrently in terms of rail demand. E
defaultverything we have built has outstripped all 
defaultof 
defaultour projections.
default If you look at a 20-year timetable and you start the 
defaultassessment or 
defaultmodelling in 2015, 
defaultyou 
defaultshut it off 
defaultin terms of growth 
defaultin 2035. I und
defaulterstand that for most projects—
defaultbut not for a project that does not finish until 2033. In terms of the growth you only get two years of benefit and then it flattens off
default,
default because that is what the model says. That has got to be wrong, hasn’t it?
default&#xa0;
defaultQ14 default&#xa0; 
defaultGraham Stringer:default I agree with that. There has been a lot of debate about whether business people can work on High Speed 2. I am not sure whether they do or they don’t. I have always thought that is irrelevant. The real benefit of the project is capacity and induced economic growth in different parts of the country. Do you think the part of the economic assessment that deals with the time saving—the fact that 
defaulta
default business person can be in their office that bit longer—should be scrapped from the assessment system?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: You are right, provided that business people can sit down, of course. Currently around 100,000 people a day coming into 
defaultLondon
default stand
default,
default and that is not going to get any better unless we work on capacity. 
defaultYou will find that element of the case for justifying it will be reduced in the new strategic business plan.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ15 default&#xa0; 
defaultGraham Stringer:default Do you accept the figures in the recent KPMG report 
defaultwhich indicate
default that High Speed 2 would be paid for in 30 years by increased revenue into the Treasury?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: I have not been through that detail, to be honest.
defaultGraham Stringer:default If you haven’t, you haven’t.
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: All I would say is that the upgrade on West Coast had a certain level of forecast. There is a 70% increase in patronage in 10 years from 
defaultManchester
default to 
defaultLondon
default and
default a 60% increase from 
defaultBirmingham
default to 
defaultLondon
default. There was a business plan based on that. They have already hit 30% of that target within a very short period of time. We have outstripped the business case for the West Coast route modernisation, as it was called, because traffic growth has been far in excess of what anyone predicted.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ16 default&#xa0; 
defaultIain Stewart:default In both the context of HS2 and the rail system more generally there has been some recent comment that capacity issues could be helped, if not solved, by getting rid of first class and converting those carriages to standard class accommodation. Do you think that is a red herring or is there some merit in that?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: I read something about that today. That is really for the train operating companies to work through with the Department. There are lots of things you can do. All of them are small and incremental and they will eke a little bit more out of the existing system. What High Speed 2 does is make a monumental increase in capacity. There will be 18 new train paths. Train paths are like landing slots at Heathrow. They are very valuable and you can’t invent new ones. At the 
defaultmoment Virgin on West Coast has
default about 10 or 12 an hour, but 18 new ones could potentially take 1,000 people each. That is a massive increase in capacity. When it opens
default,
default it will also take around half a million lorry movements off the existing road network by creating capacity on the West Coast. If you were to build the motorway equivalent of that
default,
default it is about two new motorways. There is the passenger capacity as well as the freight 
defaultthat
default is freed up on the existing line. It is that huge leap in capacity 
defaultthat
default is the crucial prize in this whole major project.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ17 default&#xa0; 
defaultIain Stewart:default I have one last question on HS2. Last year the Secretary of State announced that he was going to look at the feasibility of extending HS2 towards 
defaultScotland
default. Are you able to give us any update on what work is being done on that?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: No, I can’t. All I would say is that in control periods 5, 6 and 7, which will be over the timetable, there has to be development on the existing network
default,
default including the section north of Preston—that is 
defaultScotland
default—to get maximum benefit out of High Speed 2. I am sure that will happen.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ18 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Part of the case for High Speed 2 is developing new services for passengers and freight on the freed-up lines. Whose responsibility is it to make sure that work is actually done?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: It is Network Rail’s responsibility to advise High Speed 2 and the Department. We have done that and put work into that. We did a public study about six months ago about the availability. I wouldn’t try working out winners and losers
default,
default because by building this extra capacity there is time over the next years to work out how best to use that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ19 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default What would happen if high-speed rail
default was folded into Network Rail and stopped being a separate organisation?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: No matter what happens
default,
default I believe that both High Speed 2 and Network Rail need to work incredibly closely together. The 
defaultkey thing is the network itself—
defaulthow you make sure that the train services on the existing network, freight 
defaultand so on
default, tie into 
defaultwhat will be 
defaultquite a few junction point
defaults where you can get on the high-
defaultspeed network. It is what we call a system operator. You need a controlling mind that works out how you prioritise traffic not only in the good times but when you have disruption on the network. It is essential that the tw
defaulto organisations work together. On w
defaulthether they can be one organisation in a project of this size and scale—and you might call me conflicted here—it would not be surprising if the Secretary of State would want a fairly heavy hand to know what is going on from a project point of view
default,
default because it is such a mammoth project. I think you will find that
default,
default with High Speed 2
default,
default the Department and Network Rail will reach agreement in the coming months on how that relationship works.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ20 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default There is a lot of concern that investment in High Speed 2 could starve necessary investment in the existing classic line. Do you see any evidence of that happening?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: I don’t see that. I see strong support from both the Government and the regulator to continue to invest. We have virtually finished the control period 5 negotiations to take us through to 2019. That is again a record investment in the existing network. Work has alrea
defaultdy started on control period 6
default, which
default takes us to 2024
default, 
defaultand 
defaultthe 
defaultschemes involve
defaultd 
defaulta
defaultcross
default 
defaultthe
default nation 
defaultmean
default 
defaultthat
default it
default won’t be starved of funds. I do believe 
defaultlonger-
defaultterm 
defaultthat you need to look at how the two projects are funded and the long-term sustainability of all that, but I don’t see any evidence that the existing network will be starved of funds.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ21 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Improving efficiency in the railways will be an ongoing issue for both 
defaulthigh-
defaultspeed rail and the classic line. You have been chairing the Rail Delivery Group
default,
default which was set up to improve working between different parts of the rail industry and improve efficiency. What have you actually been able to deliver?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: First, I was deput
defaulty chair. Tim O’Toole from First
defaultGroup has been a very competent chair, I have to say. The first thing we have been able to do is enable the CEOs of the rail operating companies, freight and Network Rail, with the support of ATOC, to meet every month. We discuss the industry’s major issues. 
defaultOne of the big commentaries of the McNulty report on the rail industry was that there was no leadership and a very fragmented railway. We do have one of the most fragmented railways in the world with the way our system is set up. The Rail Delivery Group was the industry’s response to McNulty, saying that we can take a leadership position. It is everything from the franchising rounds right through to issues on smart ticketing and technology, which we are heavily involved in, and through to access. 
defaultO
defaultne of the major challenge
defaults we face with a huge workload—a record workload—on the network 
defaultis how we get more efficient access and 
defaultare
default quicker on and off the track when we need to maintain or do major work. There is a lot of 
defaultgood 
defaultwork going on there. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ22 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default What have you actually been able to achieve?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: Pilot projects. We have projects where we have changed timetables, whether it 
defaultis
default in 
defaultKent
default or the east midlands. We have been able to make 
defaultavailable 
defaultmore weekend time slots for 
defaultweekend 
defaulttravel for the public. We are getting more efficient access mid
default-
defaultweek to be able to maintain and do capital upgrades on the projects.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ23 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default One of the areas you have been looking at is the franchises. What has improved there?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: There has been a great combination. Everyone expected, with the natural comm
defaultercial tensions within the rail-
defaultowning groups, that they would be competing with each other. In response to Richard Brown’s study
default,
default the RDG came out as a single voice with a series of 11 recommendations. They were done in a private consultation with the Department and with Richard Brown. I am pleased to say that all of those recommendations were very seriously considered and most of them taken up. That is the first time that the industry has spoken with a single voice. I think even the Department was somewha
defaultt surprised at how unified they
default were. In the end
default,
default the result that came out of the report and from Peter Wilkinson’s work within the Department has been very constructive.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ24 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Are £3.5 billion of efficiency savings going to be achieved by 2019?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: If we go back to 2005
default,
default we were an industry 
defaultof 
defaultover £7 billion. By 2019
default,
default we forecast the industry’s public subsidy 
defaultto
default the railway to be around £2.6 billion. Will we achieve £3.5 billion? 
defaultW
defaulte will achieve a target
default, we think,
default of between £2.5 billion and £2.7 billion by the end of 2019. The reason I can’t be explicit about your figure of £3.5 billion is because a number of the savings—i.e. the non-Network Rail savings—come from the franchising process. While it is slightly delayed
default,
default it has now 
defaultbeen 
defaultworked with the industry and that will deliver savings. We obviously won’t know what those are until the competitive process is in place for franchising.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ25 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default The West Coast Main Line debacle has cost at least £50 million. Has that had an impact on all of this? Are you going to be able to work around that?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: The good thing is that out of all challenges come opportunities.
defaultChair:default That is a good way of putting it.
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: What the Department was facing was something that was unrealistic. The timetable they were set and the number of renegotiations or franchise bids they had to do
default, in the end,
default would have ended up in a very difficult position. 
defaultWe now have—or th
defaulte industry thinks
default we have—
defaulta much more realistic programme spread out over a number of years. There have been some very pragmatic extensions. The solutions on Western and Thameslink now
default, for example,
default recognise the massive amount of capital works that are going on to those projects. They are not trying to force the industry to take a fixed price risk, not knowing how those projects will impact performance. I think we have a much better solution. The Government and taxpayer will benefit from the franchising process and from what has come out of West Coast.
default              defaultChair:default You are saying, in a different way, that that target will not 
defaultin fact 
defaultbe achieved.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ26 default&#xa0; 
defaultIain Stewart:default I have a couple of questions on achieving efficiency and savings. The first relates to the alliance with South Wes
defaultt Trains—
defaultthe 
defaultWessex
default alliance. When I last asked about this it was deemed too early to be able to 
defaultevaluate what sorts of savings we
defaultre being delivered. Are you able to give an estimate now?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: When we set up the alliance in May of last year I
default sat with the c
defaulthairman of Stagecoach and we agreed three objectives. The first objective was to run a safer railway. The second objective was that we wanted to run a better one for the customers. At the very end we said that we wanted to save money. That is the first thing we have done. We have looked at everything from driver rosters to the number of drivers and through to investment on the track and how we do renewals on this very di
defaultfficult, overused railway line i
defaultn 
defaultWessex
default. I follow the progress closely. It is a really difficult railway to operate. As you will have seen today in ATOC’s press release, it delivers substantial money to the Government every year.
default              
defaultWe have to make some very difficult decisions on that railway line in the next three to four years. 
defaultThe throat of 
defaultWaterloo
default, which
default is a massively used station
default,
default really needs a substantial overhaul. Fortunately
default,
default in the current control period we are just negotiating
default to start in March of next year, t
defaulthe Government have set aside some £300 million. We need to fix up that particularly vulnerable section from Wimbledon into 
defaultWaterloo
default 
defaultthat
default is so prone to failure and subject to single incidents, whether they are suicides or points failures. We need to get that right and work out access and how we do that. 
defaultYes, it
default will 
defaultdisrupt
default the public unfortunately, but we have to do that in an open way so that everyone is clear what the trade-offs and consequences are if we don’t do that work.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ27 default&#xa0; 
defaultIain Stewart:default But 
defaultyou are con
defaultfident that you will be able to quantify the savings that this allia
defaultnce is delivering at some point.
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: We certainly will be able to, yes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ28 default&#xa0; 
defaultIain Stewart:default The other question I had is a forward-looking one. I am aware that Network Rail is commissioning a traffic management project to have a more efficient use of paths on the existing network.
default I have heard some concern that, 
defaultsince the initial tendering process
default,
default the technology has advanced and you are not fully evaluating bids 
defaultthat 
defaulthave this new technology. Are you able to comment on that?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: I am aware of the case that you 
defaultrefer
default to. I have asked for an independent review of the tendering process with that particular company that has queried that issue. I would say that traffic management is a huge opportunity for our railways to get better benefit out of it. There are global companies. It is not a technology that is not used elsewhere. Other countries such as 
defaultJapan
default use it all the time. Companies like 
defaultHitachi
default, Thales and Italian companies have this technology. We should bring it in in a way that delivers relatively quick results, but you need a system that works.
default              
defaultMy only comment is that
default,
default on the organisation you are talking about, they don’t have a traffic management system. They hope to have one in a year or two’s time but they don’t have one now. They don’t have one that anyone else uses and we would be asked to take a leap of faith that that may happen. I am not sure, but I have an open mind and I have asked for an independent review of that particular tendering process.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ29 default&#xa0; 
defaultIain Stewart:default Who is conducting the review?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: Our head of finance—our director of f
defaultinance. He will make sure that it is totally separate from the procurement process.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ30 default&#xa0; 
defaultGraham Stringer:default I suspect I have had exactly the same briefing as Mr Stewart. Will you be making that independent review available to this Committee?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: Yes,
default we can do that. I have the same concerns that you have. I know the company and their employment base. Traffic management is a massive need for our organisation. It is often not the technology 
defaultthat
default is the issue; it is how we get the industry to accept that it is something they can trust. With new technology, particularly in rail, these things sometimes don’t work. We have to have something that is tried and true. People can visit other countries in the area and see it in practice
default,
default and have the confidence that it will work when we turn it on.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ31 default&#xa0; 
defaultGraham Stringer:default I accept that. I don’t think any member of this Committee would put themselves in a position where they could make a decision between different competing commercial organisations, but we do want to be satisfied that the right process is undergone. The briefing I have had is that there is £1 billion difference between one system and the other.
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: If I thought there was I wouldn’t be hesitating at all, but I am convinced there isn’t. The proposed saving is substantially less on something that is not proven, but let us wait for the independent review.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ32 default&#xa0; 
defaultGraham Stringer:default And you will provide the Committee wi
defaultth that before a final decision.
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: I will do that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ33 default&#xa0; 
defaultGraham Stringer:default That is very helpful indeed. 
defaultI want to go back to the questions about the Rail Delivery Group that were asked before. One of my general worries about Network Rail and the Rail Delivery Group is that it is a bit too cosy. It
default is right to get people 
defaultwho have an interest
default together
default. Network Rail itself has an unusual and unique governance structure. How can you reassure the Committee
default,
default when you have a governance structure where the users of the service control it—you don’t have shareholders or elected people doing something—and you now have a Rail Delivery Group 
defaultwhich
default again is the users, that the taxpayer, the passenger and the freight user are getting best value for money?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: You are right that we do have an unusual structure in our country. We are unlike any other railway industry in the world. Every other railway has one dominant major user, whether it 
defaultis
default Amtrak in 
defaultAmerica
default, 
defaultEast 
defaultJapan
default, SNC
defaultF
default or DB. Even in 
defaultHolland
default or 
defaultSweden
default,
default there is always one dominant carrier that has very close links between the ordering and running of the train and the infrastructure. 
default              
defaultWe have gone for a completely different model
default,
default which is incredibly fragmented. Most of the rest of the world come here and say, “How in the hell does this ever work with no co-ordination of a few dominant operators in the whole thing?” That is the model we start from. 
default              
defaultIn many ways I would say we are an industry set up for conflict. Our charters are drawn up by some 
defaultlawyers, and they are 
defaultvery smart lawyers
default,
default but the principle was, “Via a series of penalties, claims and legal contracts
default,
default we will force you to work together
default,
default otherwise bad things will happen
default.”
default I have never seen any other industry succeed that way, whether it 
defaultis
default oil and gas or construction. It just seems to be an industry set up for conflict
default,
default and that is what has happened.
default              
defaultThe Rail Delivery Group is a first step in saying to an organisation that we are still bound by contract. None of that has changed. There is Schedule 4, Schedule 8, performance me
defaultasures, the regulator and the DF
defaultT. We still have an enormous amount of scrutiny driving performance
default,
default but there is a 
defaultcommon good. There is a 
defaultreason why everyone else in the world does it differently 
defaultfrom
default us. That is where the value changes and that is how you operate railways. We are trying to say to everyone, “Put aside your individual company commercial interests and try and act as an industry for the better good of the railways.” That is what the Rail Delivery Group was set up to do. I believe it has taken that principle. I am really impressed with the time and effort that these busy CEOs of the holding companies put in and their ownership of it. We should certainly support that and not try 
defaultto
default encourage fragmentation.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ34 default&#xa0; 
defaultGraham Stringer:default I am asking the same question 
defaultagain
default,
default 
defaultreally
default,
default but perhaps more pointedly
default. How can you reassure me and the people I represent as taxpayers that
default,
default when you get together in that structure
default,
default it isn’t a conspiracy against the taxpayer to make those companies have an easier life and be more profitable? How can you reassure me?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: Yes—
defaultthat there is not cartel behaviour.
defaultGraham Stringer:default I understand that you have a rail industry with 40 participants and that is difficult. 
defaultG
defaultet
defaultting them
default together
default is sensible
default, but
default, when they get together,
default how can you reassure us that it is not a conspiracy against the public, to misquote Adam Smith?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: The most important protection is that it has no statutory authority to make any commercial decisions to direct any one of the parties there. The Rail Delivery Group was purposely set up this way. It can’t bind any member. It has no authority to do away with, amend or in any way act in precedence ahead of the commercial agreements that bind the train operating companies and the freight companies to the Department or ourselves to the regulator in that tripartite arrangement. There is nothing that this group can ever do that can breach those key commercial arrangements. That is the protection. You are right to say it
default,
default because we have seen cartels operate in other areas, but none of this affects the commercial area.
default              
defaultThe other thing we do is to regularly invite in the chair of the regulator. We are quite open about that. We have had t
defaulthe Department in. In fact, the director-g
defaulteneral sat in on our last meeting last month and talked about what the Department w
defaultanted and what the concerns
default of the Secretary of State
default were
default. We had a workshop only about three or four months ago with all members of the Rail Delivery Group. It is all about trying to get better benefit out of this industry for the public and the taxpayers.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ35 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Why have the delays on rail attributable to Network Rail increased so much? You have not met your targets, have you?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: In terms of the overall targets, there are a lot of them. If I am allowed the indulgence of this Committee to go back a fraction, the fi
defaultrst thing is that we have learned
default a lot—both ourselves as Network Rail and the regulator—since the targets were set in 2008 in a time of recession. There are three things that affect our targets that were not considered at the time when the targets were set.
default              
defaultThe first thing is that extreme weather was not considered and isn’t provided for in our settl
defaultement. If I look at the last 10 years from 2000, in the last 100
default years
default, of
default the f
defaultive most extreme weather events and
default the wettest years on record
default,
default four have happened since 2000. The fifth of course was in 1954. Extreme weather was never allowed in it. Of course, last year it was the wettest summer on record, flowing through into winter. The Victorian railways are not set up for that. When we have extreme weather we do one thing. We operate our railways safely but we don’t cancel trains. We had a huge number of delay minutes last summer because we made a conscious decision to keep running trains. We thought that it was more important to move people than it was to cancel trains.
default              
defaultThe second issue is that
default,
default when the settlement was made and the targets were set
default,
default the major project
defaults
default work on the railways was much less than it is today. I can give a simple example. Crossrail was not in the settlement. It was not in the control period 4 settlement; neither was electrification. We are doing all those b
defaultillions of pounds-
defaultworth of work
default above and beyond. I would love every project to be finished, but
default,
default as those who travelled on the railway this morning will know
default,
default there are a few overruns. We are doing a massiv
defaulte amount of work on the railway
default now and that affects us.
default              
defaultThe third issue is growth. When the growth was set in 2008 it allowed for overall growth of around 6% of the railway network. It has turned out to be around 9%. The oft
default-
default quoted figure of PPM—public performance measure, as it 
defaultis 
defaultcalled—is about trains, not about people or passengers. What I can say is that by the end of this control period, every year 200 million more people will arrive on time than they did at the start of the control period.  Why is that? It is because every month we are providing 13,000 additional train services than were allowed for in the bid. That means we are moving a lot more people on time and ahead of what was in the control period bid, but if you just measure 
defaultPPM, if you just measure 
defaultwhen a train arrives on time
default,
default then
default,
default because we are running a lot more trains than we expected to
default,
default the public performance measure is flat. It is flat at around 91% of trains within the acceptable performance figures. That is the reason why that has occurred.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ36 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default You have mentioned extreme weather, but isn’t it the case that the ORR exclude data where there is extreme weather
default from their calculations
default?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: It is not excluded from delay minutes or Schedule 8
default,
default and it certainly hasn’t been excluded to date from any of their considerations of whether or not they will fine us.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ37 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default So when the ORR say that you haven’t made reasonable efforts to meet the targets, presumably you are disagreeing with them
default.
default 
defaultW
defaulthy?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: We set out our case
default,
default but in the end
default,
default ultimate
defaultly,
default the ORR 
defaultare
default the judge. They make a final determination and we cannot challenge that. We do make the case on those three key points. It is not correct to say that this railway is designed for extreme weather. Last summer we had 50 major landslides in 
defaultw
defaultestern, 
defaultparticularly south-
defaultwest 
defaultEngland
default, 
defaultin one day.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ38 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default But couldn’t you have prevented some of those landslides? Isn’t it the case that Network Rail has been criticised for failure to do work in such a way that some of those events would be minimised?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: You can reduce some, but we have over 120,000 slopes. We have 80,000 tunnels, bridges and structures across the network. Half of those 80,000 are over 100 years old. 
defaultW
defaulte found last summer that railway embankments failed that had been classified as stable and reasonably good just because of the level of water that had built up in rivers or the amount of rain we had. I don’t believe you can ever provide for 
defaultthat 
defaultor design 
defaultit 
defaultout. Unfortunately
default,
default many of o
defaultur railway
default lines have been bu
defaultilt on, beside or even in water
defaultcourses. Therefore
default,
default because they have been around for 100 years or so
default, they are very exposed to that sort of weather
default. We will do a lot more monitoring. We can progressively improve
default flood defences and monitoring
default, but it is much more a case of pre-empting what happens when a bad event happens so that we keep the railways safe.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ39 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default When do you think you will meet your targets?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: The really big improvement we have had—and it has taken two years of negotiation with the ORR, in which I have been heavily involved—is to say that railway embankments and 
defaultrailway 
defaultstructures are all different. Many of them were never even designed. Of course
default,
default they are old and Victorian. We have to progressively work through them and take, in the case of structures, 10 years to spend money responsibly. It would be irresponsible to throw money at the structures toda
defaulty. We have done a lot of work on
default our policies. Internationally
default,
default we are seen as right at the top with our standards of de
defaultaling with historic structures, but w
defaulte need a very sensible risk-based approach because we could just spend an infinite amount of money on both embankments and structures to deal with 
defaultthem
default responsibly. If you look at our safety performance on embankments and structures we have a very solid record, but we do need to have a measured approach so that we spend public money sensibly.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ40 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default The ORR are very specific in their complaints about your performance. They talk about maintenance backlogs, problems with asset 
defaultmanagement 
defaultand slow progress in delivering efficiencies. Are you saying that they are wrong?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: No; they are right. We can always do better. We work very
default, very
default hard. They are right in terms of maintenance and renewals. In the first years of the control period
default,
default there were things that we carried out which had an impact on performance. There is no doubt about that. To put our draft determination and strategic business plan five years ago in 2008 into context with where we are today, what we thought we needed to run the railway and what the regulator said we could have to run it was a gap of £3 billion. The only way we could solve that gap was to
default substantially reduce the front-
defaultline maintenance st
defaulta
defaultff. It was no use saying that we were going to ignore that and just keep ploughing on. 
defaultWe too
defaultk 2,500 people out of our front-
defaultline track maintenance and I stand by that decision. You don’t do that without it being difficult. It has been a difficult transition. We stopped a lot of track renewal because the targets we were set of £1 billion saving on track renewal meant we had
default to stop and buy new equipment f
defaultr
defaultom
default 
defaultSwitzerland
default and wait for it to arrive. We had to change policies to save that £1 billion. We will go very close to saving all that money, but
default,
default in implementing it
default,
default there is no doubt that it has had an impact on our railway. We could have done things better, but there was a consequence of taking £3 billion out of how we used to run the railway.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ41 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default You are saying
default,
default then
default,
default that you took significant numbe
defaultrs of people out of maintenance.
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: Yes, we did.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ42 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default You reduced track maintenance and you reduced planned maintenance. Isn’t that a great indictment of the way you approach the work?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: No. The way you traditionally carry out maintenance on railways—it is how they do it in 
defaultJapan
default or 
defaultGermany
default—is to replace track on a set time schedule. Every so many years you replace the sleepers, the track and ballast. You do the inspections on certain routines. That is great and that is what we used to do, but
default,
default when you want to save £1 billion in renewables and you want to save substantial money in maintenance
default, you have to move to what i
defaults called “risk-
defaultbased”. 
default              
defaultThere is no point in replacing a railway track if it can last longer than seven years or 15 ye
defaultars, as it is supposed to. What i
defaults more, even if it is going to fail
default,
default if it is on a line that has a train once a day at 50 m
defaultph
default, it is not going to be catastrophic even if it does have a rail break. Risk-based maintenance has caused us to re-skill our people, change our work methods and change our methods of renewal. It is the only way we are going to get to these levels of cost structures on both renewals and maintenance. Japanese and German companies now come to look at us and say, “How did you do that transition?”
default&#xa0;
defaultQ43 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default What changes are you proposing to make to improve your performance? Are you suggesting that you are not going to make any
default because you have changed the way you do things
default?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: No
default, of course
default not
default; no. I hope I don’t sound of
defaultfensive. I will never be satisfied with our asset condition. 
defaultWe need good asset management. 
defaultWe do have an external company that rates our organisation on asset management. I am happy to send those figures. It is called AMCL an
defaultd they are a big
default international company. What they will say is that
default, on asset management capability,
default in the last five years there has been a very substantial improvement in Network Rail’s capability of asset management. As we move to risk-based maintenance and risk-based renewal
defaults
default, it means that your knowledge of your assets has to be very good. Our knowledge of our rail is very good by world standards. Our level of rail breaks is very good by European standards. We are substantially ahead of the French and German railways in the way we deal with that. Our asset knowledge of other parts of our network 
defaultis not as good as that, and w
defaulte need to work on that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ44 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultWhat are you going to do to change that? 
defaultThe 
defaultORR have made that
default one of their major criticisms—
defaultthat 
defaultthe
default knowledge of your assets is not good.
default defaultSir David Higginsdefault: We launched a programme some two years ago called ORBIS. It is a technology programme that digitally documents a lot of the railway. It enables our track workers through the latest technology to be able to get access to all the information coming out of measurement trains so that our track workers and engineers on the ground have real-time information about what is happening on the track. At the moment we have a measurement train for feedback
default,
default but that is old technology. We need to put measurement devices on the actual trains themselves to measure everything from the overhead line to the way the train performs. In many ways
default,
default we lead the world on remote condition monitoring and 
defaultthe 
defaultvideo inspections of our track. We need to do more 
defaultand more 
defaultof that work to hit the efficiency targets that the regulator has set, which I have to say are incredibly tough.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ45 default&#xa0; 
defaultGraham Stringer:default I have been on this Committ
defaultee long enough to remember the c
defaulthie
defaultf e
defaultxecutive of Railtrack assuring the Committee that Paddington was the safest railway station in the world. I think those were his words. Can you reassure the Committee that the whole of the track under your responsibility is now completely safe?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: I can never guarantee anything like that. What I can say is that
default,
default in terms of targets
default,
default I have made it abundantly clear within our organisation that there is only one target that keeps me awake at night, and that is safety. I have been very clear in terms of our organisation where funding goes and that focus. I am pleased with our performance if you compare it 
defaultwith
default our European colleagues—and it is vetted independently by the regulator and by European standards—but I will never be satisfied with level crossings. 
defaultWe have 6,000 level crossings. They are all a risk. I know that this Committee is doing a full investigation, and rightly so, on level crossings. It is by far the largest risk on the railways. I expect us to make a 25% improvement in the risk 
defaultthat level crossings pose
default to our railways ove
defaultr this control period. One thing
default I hope the regulator will consider in our bid as they determine the additional money in the next few weeks is that we have asked for additional money on level crossings to ensure that that improvement continues
default on
default.
default              
defaultAlarmingly, there have been too many major incidents in the western world of train crashes in the last three years. We 
defaultfocus on them extremely closely and we take a great amount of focus on that.
default The RSSB committee is one that I will always attend. It is a very important organisation that is external to our organisation. It scrutinises best practice in the industry and monitors our performance along with 
defaultRAIB. 
defaultWe have a proud safety record on train performance but we are never complacent. I am not satisfied with our safety performance in our work
default 
defaultforce. I believe that
default,
default while it may be good compared 
defaultwith
default other European railway companies, it is poor compared 
defaultwith
default other industries. We have an enormous amount of focus on that at the moment.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ46 default&#xa0; 
defaultGraham Stringer:default I will come on to the work
default 
defaultforce in a minute. Are you saying that there has been no reduction in safety standards because of the change in the maintenance regime?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: No; safety standards are never compromised. I will compromise performance instead of safety any time. I will put speed restrictions on if we have any concerns. I don’t make any judgment. I don’t consider either the Schedule 8 consequences of that or the consequences of the timetable if I have any concerns.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ47 default&#xa0; 
defaultGraham Stringer:default One 
defaultof the big improvements that have
default been made over the last 10 years is to bring maintenance in-house. I have had submissions—I don’t know if the other members of the Committee have—that some of the subcontractors that are still being used are on zero-hour contracts, which means that they can work for a number of different companies and the checks on their working time is not as good as it should be. Are you aware of that
default as a problem
default?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: That is correct. We have a method of determining whether you can come on to the rai
defaultlways. It is called a Sentinel c
defaultard. At the moment there are over 300,000 people who are eligible at any time to come on to our railways. We have about 80,000 that are active. The card is like a credit card. What was obvious to us was that the process was being abused. This is the card here. It is a smart card. This is a new one called Sentinel 2. You have to go through a full 
defaultdetailed 
defaulttest to get this, but this is now a smart card. Over the next few months this will replace—
default              defaultChair:default A division has been called. The Committee is suspended for 10 minutes.
default&#xa0;
defaultSitting suspended for a Division in the House.
default&#xa0;
defaultOn resuming
default—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ48 default&#xa0; 
defaultGraham Stringer:default You were telling us about the passes to get on to the railway.
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: What you said was absolutely correct. It was a system of getting access to t
defaulthe track which was past its use-
defaultby date, frankly. These new cards I just showed you before the break have a lot more details on the individuals and provide a much stricter control of people getting on to the track. They also streamline, from a wo
defaultrker’s point of view, the smart
defaultphones getting on to the track. We believe that will 
defaultnot only 
defaultclean out a lot of people 
defaultwho
default shouldn’t be on the track but will stop a lot of cases w
defaulthere people are double
default-
defaultj
defaultobbing—
defaultwhere they are working on one project and running up much longer hours than they 
defaultever should—because w
defaulte will have a much more accurate record of that.
default              
defaultGoing back to the
default issue of labour agencies and zero-hour contracts, I have certainly made it very clear that
default I am unhappy having any safety-
defaultcritical roles 
defaultboth within Network Rail and our whole supply chain 
defaultas zero-hour contracts. The industry is now in the process of migrating out. It is a very large industry
default in zero hours
default. We have also been to the industry—the agency workers and companies—and said, “This industry needs to reform.” We want to lead the process with the industry. We have 
defaulthad 
defaulta series of industry meetings and workshops
default,
default and 
defaultwe intend to publish 
defaultat the end of 
defaultthis month—
defaultOctober
default—
defaultor early November our blueprint of how we believe the industry should reform. We are a major employer in the industry, in the rail sector, and we want not only our direct labour force but also the contracting industry to embrace these reforms on this issue. We think there is a valid role for an agency work
default 
defaultforce. We just believe there needs to be a minimum standard 
defaultthat
default all parts of the industry embrace. We want to bring our contracting work
default 
defaultforce along with that as well. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ49 default&#xa0; 
defaultGraham Stringer:default When will the new authorisation system be fully implemented for people to get on to the rail network?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: Most of it is through Network Rail right now. It will all be done by Christmas
default,
default but 
defaultit is progressively happening 
defaultthrough the entire industry.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ50 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Do you accept 
defaultthe 
defaultORR’s conclusion that you are falling behind on efficiency targets?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: That is correct. Maybe I am pre-empting the next six months
default,
default but I don’t believe we will 
defaultactually 
defaulthit the full efficiency target set in control period 4. There are a number of reasons for that. Our organisation and 
defaultI
default consciously made the decision to put money back into maintenance. As I said earlier on, we did take quite a lot of track workers out of maintenance in the early years. We have put money back in there and have put some additional money into expenditure on some of the assets. That means that we will not hit the full extent of our efficiency targets. I expect us to hit somewhere around 18% efficiency. I don’t know the final determination 
defaultthat
default will come out
default from the regulator for control period 5, but I would expect it to be somewhere between 18% and 20%. 
defaultYes, w
defaulte will be a couple of per
default 
defaultcent below what I believe was a very ambitious target when you add on those three other elements that I explained earlier on—the growth that we have had to accommodate, major projects and the extreme weather.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ51 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default What proportion of your maintenance staff are agency workers?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: We don’t 
defaultemploy directly or 
defaulthave any people on our books on zero-hours contracts. We have about 30-odd companies that we employ as an agency work
default 
defaultforce to add to our current maintenance team. 
defaultWith the peaks of coming on to the railway out of hours, w
defaulte do utilise agency work
default 
defaultforce to top up 
defaultmainly 
defaultour works delivery work
defaults on the site
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ52 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Is that something that you will always do
default? This is not a temporary thing?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: It is 
defaultinefficient to resource in full-
defaulttime direct labour f
defaultor the absolute peak. We are an industry 
defaultthat has a lot of peaks
default and troughs. At Easter and on bank h
defaultolidays we have these extreme work cycles because that is the only time we can get access to the track. It would not be responsible to have all those people as full-time staff for five days a week or seven days a week on the books when we can use them for those extreme periods. It is an industry that will always utilise contingent labour. As I said in answer to the earlier question, there do need to be standards 
defaultthat
default are acceptable 
defaultnot only 
defaultfrom a safety point of view but from a skills point of view. There is no point having a labour force 
defaultwhich
default is too easy to get into or 
defaultin which 
defaultwe are 
defaultnot getting a sufficient level of skills.

defaultQ53 default&#xa0; 
defaultMartin Vickers:default Sir David, earlier you mentioned the problems that landslips were causing. Certainly my constituents were very familiar with that on the 
defaultDoncaster
default to Cleethorpes line earlier this year with the Hatfield landslip. What that show
defaulted
default to some extent was the inflexibility of making alternatives when two alternative routes are available. Yes, there were problems with capacity and train operators not wanting to give up paths and so on, but that also comes into the regular scheduled weekend engineering. As you will appreciate, passengers would much rather have 15 or 20 minutes extra on a train that is going on a diversion than hav
defaulte
default to offload with baggage and so on. What additional work is being done to improve the situation of making a seven-day railway 
defaultin effect 
defaultand trying to iron out some of these inflexibilities?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: You are absolu
defaulttely right. The collapse of the
default coal dump at Hatfield had a devastating impact on the commuter services and freight because, as you know well, that line supplies a lot of big power stations. It is a crucial line and they did an amazing job in moving a 
defaultcouple of 
defaultmillion ton
defaultne
defaults of coal dust off our railway, where it shouldn’t have been, and returning it
default, I think,
default in record time. That was something that impacted on us. Of course, we paid delay minutes. We paid many millions of pounds in Schedule 8 to our train operating companies for that inconvenience. The knock-on effect
default,
default as you say, because of the inflexibility of the network and the lack of resilience, is still bei
defaultng felt today. The modification
default of the GNGE, as we call it, which is the upgrade of the line through 
defaultLincoln
default, has
default been put back by many months. It means that this Christmas we have record workloads because we had to put off a lot of the work because we could not have any relief line. 
default              
defaultWhat are we doing? 
defaultWe are doing two things. First, we have to be more efficient as we planned. We are now in a supply constraint market. There are not enough clear-off trains, tilting wagons or signal fitters to do the work we have to do. We really have to do that and what we have done in a number of cases is this. Recently we shut down 
defaultNottingham
default station for 28 days. We got a 
defaultmassive amount of work done, 
defaultunder budget. There was a huge improvement, not only to the track but giving the station upgrade a big push ahead. We talked to the public and said, “We know it is going to be incredibly inconvenient with a bus replacement
default,
default but we will do it over the summer holiday
defaults.
default We will explain why we are doing it and will tell 
defaultyou after
default the benefit.
default”
default We did the same at 
defaultWigan
default. We shut 
defaultWigan
default on the West Coast for nine days, but 
defaultwe did what 
defaultwould have taken two and a half years of continuous disruption on every bank holiday in that area. We explained to the public. 
defaultIt was the 
defaultsame at 
defaultReading
default and at 
defaultPaisley
default 
defaultC
defaultanal
default in 
defaultScotland
default. We are going to do the same at 
defaultWatford
default on the bank holiday coming in 2014 and early 2015. That will bring the work ahead by 18 months on the West Coast. We did the same at 
defaultReading
default. We went to the public at 
defaultReading
default and said, “If we can save 18 months and in terms of the public purse tens of millions of pounds
default,
default will you put up with a lot of disruption at Easter?”
default That is the Easter that has just passed.
default The public said, “Yes. If you can explain why you are doing it, what the benefits are and that we are going to get the additional lines and platforms at Reading 18 months ear
defaultlier, yes, we will accept it,” i
defaultf you explain it properly
default and then, when you return it,
default it works. 
default              
defaultThis is what we are facing nowadays. It cannot be any more complex than 
defaultLondon
default 
defaultBridge
default, which we are just going through now. We explain well in advance to the public so 
defaultthat 
defaultthey can understand what we are doing. They then accept it, provided we do it properly and they see it bringing the benefits forward.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ54 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default How did you assess that that is what the public thought?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: We used Passenger
default Focus on a number of occasions to go out and poll the public, gi
defaultv
defaulte them the options and discuss it with them. That wa
defaults a very effective process.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ55 default&#xa0; 
defaultIain Stewart:default I would like to pick up on one comment you made about skills availability in reply to Mr Vickers’ question. There is a huge amount of investment work going into the railways over the n
defaultext couple of decades with high-
defaultspeed rail, East West Rail, Northern Hub and the electrification projects. Do you have a concern that this country has the skill and capacity to do all these projects, or is there a training need that needs to start?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: Together with the Secretary of State 
defaultfor
default Business and Industry
default,
default I was co-chairing the Construction Leadership Council before this meeting today. We spent most of the meeting talking about the ageing population of our entire construction industry, the skills gap that is coming up and how the industry can work together to address that. Yes, it is a concern to all of us in the industry, particularly with the level of investment that is happening. We at Network Rail have an award-winning apprentice programme. We have over 1
default,
default500 apprentices that have been through that programme since 2005
default,
default and 
defaultwe have 
defaulta very good graduate programme. The industry, not only in rail infrastructure but in house building and other sectors, is very focused on this issue. Certainly
default,
default on that committee I co-chair
default,
default it has to be our biggest issue.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ56 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Freight has a weighting of just 3% in your management incentive plan. Do you think you are giving enough attention to the needs of freight?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: I don’t think we focused on freight enough a f
defaultew years ago. We did appoint a director of f
defaultreight about three years back reporting to Robin Gisby, o
defaultur director of network o
defaultperations. It became more fragmented, particularly as we devolved our routes. I don’t think we took a national perspective on freight. I am clear now that that is getting better. Certainly
default,
default within the Rail Delivery Group
default,
default we have our own freight board there as well. That represents the freight industry nationally and reports through not only to the Rail Delivery Group on issues that they want address
defaulted
default but also to the Department. We are very focused on freight. Freight has set some challenging targets from the regulator. There are things that the industry needs to change too
default,
default because there are residual rights that in the end, on a crowded network, we need to be able to negotiate to see whether they are really necessary and the impact that some of these have on congested mainline routes. It is a mixed use.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ57 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default How are you going to improve freight without jeopardising passenger services?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: There 
defaultare current practices and trade-
defaultoffs that we need to challenge in how we regulate the railway. Tragically
default,
default a lot of the assets that have helped the railways manage freight were sold off in a spree of stripping out a lot of the assets from the railways, if we are being blunt about it. That has made it more difficult to regulate freight. On a couple of the key routes now
default,
default the freight sidings that have historically been put in for coal trains were not done for these new big container trains
default,
default which require much longer sidings. We are hoping to negotiate with the industry to
default essentially
default acqui
defaultre the sidings
default that were sold off during the privatisation back into Network Rail. We can then improve them and make them available for the entire industry to use. Therefore
default,
default those siding
defaults
default will allow us to get more effective use from the main network.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ58 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Can you give us a
defaultny
default clearer idea of what you are aiming to achieve 
defaultin improv
defaultin
defaultg
default freight services?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: The 
defaultchallenge for our customers—freight companies—
defaultnowadays is that more and more of their customers are very sho
defaultrt-
defaultnotice. They get requests and they have to compete with lorries and the motorways. Therefore
default,
default they need incredibly short notice and flexibility to be able to get on to our very busy mixed-use network, particularly on the West Coast. That carries 43% of the entire freight load of the whole nation. Trying to accommodate that need as their market changes is something we need to discuss in a forum. They have historical freight paths, including ones that run through the North London line
default,
default that some of them don’t use, but they keep them and use them every now and again because if they don’t they will lose them. There must be a sensible commercial resolution of those residuary rights while accommodating their very real needs to be more and more competitive. It is the most competitive part of the railway sector. 
default&#xa0;
defaultChair:default Mr Stringer, is your question on this?
default&#xa0;
defaultQ59 default&#xa0; 
defaultGraham Stringer:default 
defaultIt is on control period 5, if that is all right. 
defaultYour final determination is in just over a fortnight’s time. There appears to be quite a difference between you and the Office o
defaultf the Rail Regulator. What will
default be the consequences for the projects in control period 5 if you don’t get a resolution in your favour?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: First, I would say it is a much better process. I wasn’t around for CP4, but everyone that was involved in 
defaultit
default says this is a much more enlightened process. The relationships between 
defaultus
default and the regulator are very constructive, challenging but very open. Within our organisation from the roots up to the senior management
default,
default we know the consequences of what the settlement is. 
default              
defaultThe big breakthrough we have made with the regulator in this control period is that
default—
default rather than having to commit to a fixed price with a scope that we don’t know, 
defaultsuch as
default 
defaultis making all the structures safe, 
defaultwhich is unrealistic because we have to have an improvement programme over a number of year
defaults—in the case of major projects 
defaultwhat we have agreed is that we don’t have the detailed design for a number of the
defaultm, 
defaultbut we are giving ourselves to 2015 and a little bit beyond
default,
default we hope. 
defaultAs w
defaulte develop the design
default, we have
default an emerging cost, and then we fix with the regulator what those projects’ real cost is with a much greater level of design detail. That is the responsible way. If we had to take a fi
defaultxed-
defaultprice cost on an unknown design, we would either have to take a large bit or put a large level of contingency in, which would be wrong in both cases.
default              
defaultTo answer your question, if in years to come we are unable to reach agreement on what is a fair price for the scope of work
default,
default then I think it is an issue between ourselves, the regulator and the Department. Are there any particular projects you are concerned about?
default&#xa0;
defaultQ60 default&#xa0; 
defaultGraham Stringer:default As a constituency MP I am particularly concerned about the Northern Hub.
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: I am sure you are.
defaultGraham Stringer:default Do I have the figures right? The difference between you and the Office of the Rail Regulator is £1.4 billion
default,
default and about half of t
defaulthat is in terms of enhancements.
default Is that figure roughly right?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: The difference is £1.4 billion; that is correct. But that is not an enhancement.
defaultGraham Stringer:default No; half of that.
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: No. The £1.4 billion covers a number of areas. It covers the big areas of information management. The biggest area would be renewals
default,
default and the largest of all those by far is track renewals. We believe we have put in a very ambitious bid of reducing costs for track renewals. We got into this challenge five years ago when we had a track renewal settlement
default,
default which meant that for two years we had a substantial reduction in track renewal volume as we struggled to try and come up with a new way of doing it. We haven’t been wholly successful because we have not hit the metrics set by the regulator for track renewal. I don’t want us to go through that again because that really impacted the subcontracting industry and staff were laid off. I want us to start with a realistic figure on track renewal on major projects.
default              
defaultWith the figure on major projects there is a gap. In the case of Northern Hub the figure is £560 million, which is the figure that is set aside for the Northern Hub. That does not include any contingency. There are two projects 
defaultthat
default we are bringing forward beyond the 2015 
defaultdate. That is what we call East 
defaultWest Rail, which is 
defaultOxford
default to Bicester, and the Northern Hub. We are bringing those forward so 
defaultthat 
defaultwe can reach agreement in the short term with the regulator and get started on that. I would be really surprised if the Northern Hub is at risk. It is a fantastic project in terms of what it does. It delivers 700 new train services a day to central 
defaultManchester
default, Leeds and through to 
defaultLiverpool
default. It is just a very sensible project w
defaultith a 4:1 value-for-money ratio, which I think e
defaultveryone accepts is the right thing to do.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ61 default&#xa0; 
defaultGraham Stringer:default I certainly do. If you don’t reach agreement, will you go to the Competition Commission?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: That is something we will have to decide. We have up until January to decide.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ62 default&#xa0; 
defaultGraham Stringer:default Can you give us an indication, if things go badly for you?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: That would be giving away our negotiating position.
defaultGraham Stringer:default I accept that. I am just worried that the Northern Hub will not go ahead.
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: In the end
default it is ultimately for our board; i
defaultt is not for me to decide. You are right; 
defaultwe do hear in a few weeks’ time. O
defaultn 31
default October w
defaulte will meet with our board. We have said, as we have done in previous times, that we are not going to make 
defaultany great public fanfare that “we can’t do it with this money.
default” That is irresponsible. We will take the settlement away, discuss it in great detail with our board and analyse it. We will then come back with a response or recommendation to our board. Of course, as you would expect, we will continue to do our homework on what it would take to go to the Competition Commission
default,
default because that is ultimately the decision that our
default board and our c
defaulthairman need to make.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ63 default&#xa0; 
defaultGraham Stringer:default I am particularly interested in the Northern Hub, but are there any other projects that are potentially at risk because of the current lack of agreement?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: I wouldn’t call it a lack of agreement. The regulator in the end says—and I think it is a responsible way to go—“We are not giving you a blank cheque. We want to see the detail of what we are getting.” That is the same whether it is R
default and 
defaultD or level crossings. They have said, “We want to see what we will get for the money. We want the scope and the detail set out to us.” That is the right way to go. Provided we can prove that we have done full analysis and the design is at a proper level, we should get support.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ64 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default You have argued for “hands off” regulation. How can that be?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: We don’t have that today, no.
defaultChair:default You don’t want that.
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: No; we don’t have it today and we don’t want it.
defaultChair:default You don’t want it.
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: We have “hands on” regulation. We do need to be scrutinised. What I would say is that if you look at all the targets that will be set for us in control period 5—I suppose “metrics” is the correct term—there will be around 3,800. That is important. We are not surprised with that because those are metrics we use every day and every month to manage our business. We have different routes and different elements of both analytical analysis plus competency models 
defaultthat 
defaultwe need to take. All I would say is that
default,
default if those 3,800 metrics become targets 
defaultand
default the subject of long and detailed analysis, 
defaultit
default is going to be a massive waste of public money and a huge distraction to both the regulator and Network Rail. You need to look at them all the time, but I don’t look at and make decisions on 3,800 targets. You need to work out which ones are important to you. The 3,800 is a justifiable figure
default,
default but it is what you do with it that is important.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ65 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Your debt is expected to rise from £30 billion to £40 billion going to 2019. Why is that increasing?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: That is funding the growth on the railways. It needs to be justified
default,
default of course. We have to withstand the scrutiny of the regulator to say whether that can be
default justified against the regulated
default asset base. We have a borrowing limit compared to what that is. Your point is that that is a lot of money, and it is a lot of money. We don’t have the benefits of a number of our other Japanese or continental railway colleagues, who have had substantial amounts of debt written off at various times. We don’t have that; we have debt that has accumulated as the railway has 
defaultneeded to recover from decades of underinvestment and cope 
defaultwith growth. There will be a time—it is not today—where the sustainability of the level of debt needs to be reviewed.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ66 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Does that mean you think it will be better to make that debt part of the national debt?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: No.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ67 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default How do you think it should be done?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: It is not for control period 5 but for control period 6 and beyond. It is for High Speed 2. You need to work out how you
default want to fund the railways long-
defaultterm. As I am sure you are aware, we have a substantial obligation to 
defaultpay off debt every year—to fund debt—
defaultand that is a significant cost to the railways.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ68 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Are you likely to be repaying any of that debt?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: We roll over debt. We repay debt and then refinance. We have done a lot of 
defaultwork in the last six months to—as much as possible—
defaulthedge the rollover and the commitments we see in control period 5, albeit there is always going to be some risk in terms of timing and volume. We manage that very closely because it is a very substantial cost that we have.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ69 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default You 
defaultreferred to level crossing
default safety. The Committee is going to be conducting a separate inquiry into that. Very soon after your appointment to Network Rail
default,
default you came to this Committee and we discussed the very tragic deaths of two teenage girls at Elsenham.
default What had happened then, among
default other errors, was that safety risk assessments carried out in 2002 had not been acted on. Could that happen today?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: I would hope, when your Committee meets in the next few weeks and reviews
default it
default, that you have full access to any information we have on level crossings. We have a very open relationship with the re
defaultgulator Ian Prosser, who
default I have put on record 
defaultas being
default a fantastic support to our organisation in making, I would hope, a big change in level crossings. I would e
defaultxpect us to exceed reducing 
defaultlevel crossing risk across the network by 25% at the end of this control period. I know that we put in a huge amount of effort. We scrutinise all the routes, within the routes themselves but also by audit, as to the level of risk assessment. It is important to have risk assessment right. We have then set up level crossing executives who take accountability for the individual level crossings. The point is then what you do with all that. We have made a conscious effort. We will have closed 700 level crossings in this control period. The best thing 
defaultwith
default a level crossing is to close it. For those where we can’t, we have either put footbridges in or improved on technology, si
defaultding 
defaultlines or whatever. I think there has been a step change but you can judge for yourself. It is something on which I gave a personal commitment to the families
default involved in that tragic event—
defaultthat we would make a substantial improvement in level crossing safety.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ70 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default We will be returning to this issue in detail shortly. I would like to ask you about winter resilience. What is Network Rail doing to ensure that the trains can keep moving this winter, if it is a bad winter?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: The first thing we are really focused on is autumn. The biggest area of impact is 
defaultKent
default. That is by far the most exposed route. We have done a responsible vegetation-clearing programme with heavy consultation
default,
default after a shaky start a year or so ago. The team there have done a fantastic job. Of course, autumn i
defaults all about train crews as well and making
default sure that 
defaultthe
default rails are properly 
defaultrepaired
default. You lose autumn in the first week if a driver is concerned that the rails aren’t properly 
defaultrepaired 
defaultand they are concerned about overrunning a signal. Trains all slow down and we lose performance dramatically.
default              
defaultIn terms of winter, we have put in a massive amount of effort. We are particularly working with our train operating company partners. The biggest issue for both autumn and winter is drivers. We need the right number of drivers to be able to operate the trains. These are one-off events and we need to draw on a limited resource of drivers to be able to crew these road vehicles and trains that we set up especially for this. We are ready and very focused. I was up in 
defaultScotland
default the other week making sure that the team up there are particularly focused. We expect them to be the first impacted.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ71 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Are six snow and ice treatment trains enough?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: They are if they are properly used, they get proper access to the network and we have the right number of trains. We think we are in a substantially better position than we were. It is not only that; it is rail heating. We have done extensive work on the third rail here in the south of 
defaultLondon
default in the last two years.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ72 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default One of the issues raised last year was the lack of good information for people at the time they needed it. What are you doing to improve that?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: We are working closely with our train operating company customers. We use modern media a lot more. Our Twitter sites and the work we do with that have been very effective. Each rail company does it differently but we work very closely with them to get that information out. We can never be satisfied with the level of passenger information compared 
defaultwith
default some other industries, but the industry is putting out a huge amount of information and effort. You will see that transparency is something that the Rail Delivery Group takes very seriously.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ73 default&#xa0; 
defaultGraham Stringer:default I have one last question if we can go back to the very beginning and the High Speed 2 questions. Both in the political parties and across the country
default,
default there is a level of ignorance about the benefits of High Speed 2 and what your project is about. As we said before, the debates sometimes come down to saving 20 minutes here or 30 minutes there, which is not what it is about.
default 
defaultAre you going to be making an attempt to speak to the leading politicians in the three main parties before you take over High Speed 2?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: You must have checked my diary for tomorrow. I have a long
default-
defaultstanding appointment with the Shadow Chancellor, Ed Balls. I am seeing him tomorrow with the Shadow Rail Minister. I will also be seeing Andrew Adonis
default,
default who, let’s face it, started High Speed 2. It was his idea and he sponsored it. He is very knowledgeable, being an ex-Transport Minister.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ74 default&#xa0; 
defaultGraham Stringer:default 
defaultI think all those people are on-
defaultside. There are one or two pe
defaultople in my party who are less on-
defaultside. Will you be making an effort to see them as well?
defaultSir David Higginsdefault: What I found in my previous job was that it was extremely helpful on some of the very difficult positions, such as should shooting go to Bisley or other complicated issues we discussed on the Olympics, to ha
defaultve open forums that particular M
defaultembers of the House of Lords or Members of Parliament chose to organise. I 
defaultwould
default come along 
defaultand
default do question and answer sessions. It was not in a formal process like this here but a more open environment, where they could ask questions and we could have
default flipcharts, which
default was very effective
default, 
defaultI think rightl
defaulty,
default in answering questions that they had been confused about or in some cases misinformed
default about
default. I am happy to do that.
default&#xa0;
default              defaultChair:default I am sure we will be back with more questions on that topic. Thank you very much, Sir David, for coming today.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default
