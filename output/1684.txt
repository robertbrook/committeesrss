[[[Executive Summary]]]The Demographics User Group (DUG) represents 14 major commercial companies – Barclays, Boots, Camelot, Centrica, Co-operative Group, E.ON, Everything Everywhere, GSK, John Lewis, Marks &amp; Spencer, Sainsbury’s, Tesco, and Whitbread – which make extensive use of government statistics and geographical data to understand local markets and consumers, and make decisions about large investments in delivering better services.&#xa0;These are the tip of the iceberg of 2.3 million businesses in the UK, many of which can increase their efficiency, and grow, by using data gathered by government, which has the great advantage of consistent collection across the whole of the country.&#xa0;The key themes of this note are to:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[PASC’s questions]]]&#xa0;

[[[1. Why is open data important?]]]&#xa0;1.1 Companies require the best possible information available to understand their markets, and to make major investment decisions such as the opening of new retail outlets. Government collects huge volumes of data about citizens, and the country’s physical infrastructure, and this has the additional advantage of often being done consistently for the whole of Great Britain, or even the entire United Kingdom. We endorse the Shakespeare Review’s approach that information collected at public expense should be publicly available (subject to confidentiality limitations).&#xa0;1.2 The case for open data often focuses on the opportunities for new information-based companies to start-up and to grow, but we believe that the benefits of increasing the efficiency of existing business-to-consumer companies (such as retailers) are much larger: for example, the use of a better address register to reduce the failure rate of millions of home deliveries would result in considerable savings over one year.&#xa0;

[[[2. Why does the Government need an open data strategy?]]]&#xa0;2.1 The great benefit of the Government’s open data strategy is that it sets the tone in the public services, creating the expectation that data will be released unless there is good reason. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[3. What should the Government’s aims be for the release of open data?]]]

[[[Are the Government’s stated key outcomes in its Open Data Strategy the]]]

[[[right ones?]]]&#xa0;3.1 We strongly support the Government’s policy on Open Data, believing that as the use of data increases and extends to new users, this creates new value.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[4. How can those engaged in open data, and those engaged in producing]]]

[[[government statistics work together effectively to produce new data?]]]&#xa0;4.1 This requires continuous dialogue, so that data owners can better understand users’ needs. The Office for National Statistics has long put significant effort into consultation with users of the Census – the biggest of all open datasets – and this has been very successful. The Royal Statistical Society’s Statistics User Forum provides an excellent mechanism for understanding the needs of a wide range of user groups. And the recently established Open Data User Group provides a valuable vehicle for identifying users’ needs and priorities.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[5. How can more statistics and administrative data of all kinds become more freely]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[available?]]]&#xa0;5.1 The use of government administrative files to create new statistics needs to be accelerated. Administrative files accumulated by departments such as HMRC, DWP, Education, the NHS, and the Home Office are immensely rich potential sources of information about the population and its social characteristics. In recent years more use has been made of such files to produce aggregate statistics for small areas, but we believe that there is scope to create much more value at relatively low cost in two ways:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[6. Is open data presented well and of adequate quality?]]]

[[[a. Are the formats of the data being published accessible, useable and]]]

[[[understandable to the public?]]]

[[[b. What metadata is needed to make releases useful?]]]

[[[c. Who will use the data released?]]]&#xa0;6.1 The top priority for users of open data has been to see the principle of free access established, and datasets published, even if their quality is less than perfect, and their formats not ideal. This leaves scope for improvement, and also for better ways to search for and find relevant data. The website www.data.gov.uk now has &gt;10,000 datasets, and effort now needs to be made to highlight those which are of particular interest to certain categories of users. For example, http://www.retailresearchdata.org/Default.aspx the ESRC’s Retail Research Data website, enables insight and store location analysts working in retail organisations to get easy access to (just) those free datasets which may be of value to their businesses: less means more.&#xa0;6.2 In this way, usage can spread from a small number of specialists, to more mainstream analysts, and then to the much more numerous wider public, greatly increasing use and hence the value of the data. This has been very apparent with the increased use of the Census in the last two decades.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[7. How successful has the Government’s Open Data initiative been in changing]]]

[[[behaviour in the Civil Service and wider public sector?]]]&#xa0;7.1 The Government’s initiative has had significant success in changing behaviour in Whitehall Departments, and DUG really appreciates its involvement in Transparency Boards such as Welfare (DWP), and Tax (HMRC).&#xa0;7.2 However, in the wider public sector, progress has in some cases been fiercely resisted by BIS and the Treasury. Two matters are of great concern to us:&#xa0;7.3 We also feel that many civil servants do not realise that “commercial users” are of two distinct types: value-added resellers (VARs, which sell data to other businesses), and business-to-consumer companies (which provide services to very large numbers of citizens). For the latter, key government data sets are "business as usual" resources, and are therefore structurally important in maintaining and growing profitability, jobs, and tax revenues. It follows that government should not be content to seek only the views of VARs when wishing to understand the needs of commercial users.&#xa0;

[[[8. Which datasets are the most important?]]]

[[[a. What are the best examples of data being made open and resultant]]]

[[[benefits to business or society?]]]&#xa0;8.1 The decision to make the 2001 Census freely available was a great milestone on the journey to open data: use by commercial companies greatly increased, and it has been used as the basis for thousands of investment decisions. The arrival of the 2011 Census is just as significant. More broadly, members of DUG  have welcomed many new open data sources, especially (some) Ordnance Survey mapping, postcode directories, DWP statistics for small areas, Land Registry house prices, and GP prescribing information.&#xa0;8.2 The scope for further progress is summarised in our Data Manifesto (see Annex). Of these, our top priorities are:&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[9. How effective is the work being undertaken by the Cabinet Office to]]]

[[[ monitor the progress of Departments in publishing their agreed datasets?]]]&#xa0;9.1 It appears to be very effective indeed.&#xa0;&#xa0;2 September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
