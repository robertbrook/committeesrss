defaultWritten evidence from defaultCrohn’sdefault and Colitis UK default(LTC 36)default1.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAbout 250,000 people in the UK have Crohn’s Disease or Ulcerative Colitis, collectively known as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). However, awareness and understanding of these conditions remain very low. 
default&#xa0;
default1.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThese are lifelong conditions that most commonly diagnosed between 10 and 40. In IBD, the intestines become swollen, inflamed and ulcerated.
default 
defaultSymptoms include frequent diarrhoea (sometimes with blood and mucus), acute abdominal pain, 
defaulttenesmus
default (the constant urge to have a bowel movement), weight loss, and profound fatigue.
default 
defaultSymptoms vary in severity from person to person and flare up or improve unpredictably.

defaultIBD

default the Department of Health’s definition of a long-term condition. 
default&#xa0;
default1.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe majority of IBD Patients are managed as outpatients by specialist IBD Teams based in secondary care.
default 
defaultThe traditional approach has been to keep these patients on regular clinic follow-up to monitor their well-being, and this has in many hospitals been supplemented by a specialist nurse-led helpline to provide support and triage patients if their condition flares.
default 
default&#xa0;
default1.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAnnual reviews for people with IBD are vital
default once people are discharged to primary care as these are not systematically carried out and patients 
defaultcan be lost to follow-up. This could be addressed by a
default comprehensive
default registry of IBD patients, 
defaultwhich can be accessed by 
defaultGPs. 
default&#xa0;
default1.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe welcome the fact that people with IBD want to be treated at home, but this needs to be provided safely. 
default&#xa0;
default1.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe total cost of IBD to the NHS has been estimated at £720 million, based on an average cost of £3,000 per patient per year with up to half of total costs attributed to relapsing patients
default. 
default&#xa0;

defaultWe welcome Government efforts to increase the integration of care, w

default&#xa0;
default1.8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, there are a number of organisational and institutional barriers to achieving this, including
default:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIncreasingly hospitals have begun to 
defaultintroduce
default nurse-led telephone or virtual clinics to reduce the numbers of routine clinic appointments for essentially ‘well’ patients. Supported self-management has also been tried in a formal controlled trial and found to be safe and to reduce hospital and GP appointments.
default 
defaultThese approaches are encouraged in the 
defaultUK IBD Standards, which 
defaultaim to ensure that IBD patients receive consistent, high-quality care. The IBD Standards 
defaultwere developed by Crohn’s and Colitis UK and other
default professional
default organisations, and
default launched in 2009.
default&#xa0;
default2.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIBD nurse specialists
default 
defaultare highly valued by people with IBD, as members of Crohn’s and Colitis UK explain – 
default“
defaultI prefer to self-manage my condition and only refer to the IBD nurse when forced to due to a flare-up, or when I need to turn up for an annual check up in the IBD Clinic Oxford.
default 
defaultSupported self-management would surely free up time in the hospitals and give sufferers some degree of confidence to self-manage - with the knowledge of a sound back-up service with the IBD nurse.
default”
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultI have had flare-ups whilst on holiday abroad and I have telephoned the IBD nurse and we have had an email correspondence which was been helpful and reassuring.
default 
defaultThis email/phone connection with an IBD nurse and the service they give both initially, and when needing advice, is imperative.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is valuable and necessary for patients and it would also alleviate any pressure on doctors/consultants.
default”
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, the scope for varying the current mix of services is limited by key 
defaultstruct
defaultur
defaultal and organisational barriers.
default&#xa0;
default2.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe current Payment by Results (
defaultPbR
default) system means that commissioners pay healthcare providers for each patient seen or treated. This means that there is a correlation between procedural activity and income to hospital trusts.
default&#xa0;
default2.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs it is only outpatient clinics and formal telephone clinics for which tariff payments are available, there is
default 
defaultno incentive for any activity which avoids hospital attendances, such as an IBD nurse helpline, though avoiding attendance or admission is clearly in the patients’ best interests and saves NHS resources.
default 
defaultAs a result there is a constant battle to justify and protect the role of the IBD Specialist Nurse which is central to good care for Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCrohn’s and Colitis
default UK
default is calling for a ‘year-of
default-IBD
default-care’ tariff, which would mean that funding follows the patient between services and is not organised around specific interventions. 
defaultIt reflects a way of commissioning a year’s worth of care at a time, rather than paying for individual interventions. This is a model that could help improve long-term conditions management in a range of long-term conditions.
default&#xa0;
default2.7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAccording to a recent report by the Royal College of Physicians into the locus of treatment for people with IBD , “
defaultAlmost all GP’s [sic] indicated having some level of confidence in recognising the key symptoms of IBD in their patients with only 9.1% indicating that they were ‘not confident’ in dealing with flare-ups. There does however, seem to be a wide range in the treatments given and this may depend upon whether GPs try to contact specialists for advice and indeed if they do, who it is that they choose to contact
default.
default”
default&#xa0;
default2.8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe report revealed that GPs were
default,
default in many cases
default,
default unclear about 
defaultwhom
default they should contact
default in secondary care to discuss a patient,
default and that they found it difficult to get patients seen within seven days, despite hospitals’ insistences that pathways for rapid access 
defaultwe
defaultre available. 
default&#xa0;
default2.9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCrohn’s and Colitis UK has also received anecdotal evidence from queries submitted to our Information Service that GPs 
defaultsometimes 
defaultque
defaultstion
default treatments for IBD, and appear unaware of the debilitating psychological and social impacts that the condition can present. 
default&#xa0;
default2.10.
default&#xa0; 
defaultMembers of Crohn’s and Colitis UK have reported variable knowledge of IBD among GPs:
default&#xa0;
default“
default[My] GPs don’t seem to know what to do to manage the condition. Consultant appointments tend to be very quick, and I don’t believe that they are at all adequate from a patient perspective. This is where a specialist IBD nurse would be very useful – they are often more empathic than consultants, for a start. 
default“
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultThough my GP is always very supportive and does whatever he can to try to manage my care when there's a problem and I'm not able to be seen by a specialist, once he's referred me to a consultant/specialist nurse/
defaultdietician
default, it shouldn't really be his 
default[the GP’s] 
defaultjob to change my treatment. Other
defaultwise, why send me to an ‘expert’
default?

default that 
defaultthere is potential for IBD patients to

default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere seems to be little recognition that the current procedural tariffs are a major barrier to the development of more innovative and patient-centred care for IBD.
default 
defaultUnless there are identifiable funds that can be allocated to enable an integrated care pathway of the ongoing management of mild to moderate stable IBD, it will be very difficult to secure the funding commitment to redesign and modernise services.
default&#xa0;
default3.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere have been numbers of innovative approaches to providing cost-effective patient centred outpatient care in IBD, but there has not so far been a systematic application of these to the system of care in one Board or 
defaultCCG 
defaulto demonstrate the benefit of delivering a fully-integrated IBD Service combining some of these developments.
default 
defaultAt present commissioning bodies have not seen the potential for this and may well consider IBD not significant enough as a condition to initiate such a project.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIBD
default specialists often find
default it very difficult to obtain professional psychological support for patients.
default 
defaultWe feel that this is an example of a service that is probably needed by a proportion of patients for all long-term conditions.
default 
defaultThe NHS Commissioning Board should encourage commissioners to explore the provision of a Long-term Conditions Hub to provide expertise across conditions which would be harder to justify on a single condition basis.
default4.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is also an issue around the provision of support for lifestyle issues and the management of pain and fatigue which are poorly managed in secondary care. Integration of care could allow management of these symptoms in local settings. 
defaultThis model could also be beneficial for people with other long-term conditions. 
default&#xa0;
