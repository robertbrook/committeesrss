"&#xa0;\nWritten submission from Dr Kay H Farmer&#xa0;I am writing this \ncommunication \nas an individual but my affiliations are as follows:\n&#xa0;\n1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe extent of the trade and keeping of primates as pets within the UK&#xa0;\nIt \nhas \nbeen \nestimated \nthat \n2500-7500\n primates \nare being \nkept by private individuals in the UK as pets (Soulsbury et al., 2009). \nHowever given tha\nt markets for legal trade are inextricably linked to\n illegal trade, indeed the legal trade can be a driver of the illegal trade, the numbers being traded and kept \nis likely \nto be\n significantly underestimated. \n&#xa0;\nRef: Soulsbury C.D., Iossa G.\n, Kennell S. &amp; H\narris S. (2009). \nThe welfare and suitability of\n \nprimates kept as pets. Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Scie\nnce 12\n(1):\n 1-20\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDoes the existing regulatory framework and Code of Practice offer adequate protection for the welfare of primates kept as pets and are they being applied effectively?&#xa0;\nThe UK requires primate species listed under the Dangerous Wild Animals Act (1976) to be licensed, although recent changes to the lists have reduced the number of species for which a licence is required\n, undermining\n protection to many primate species. \n&#xa0;\nWhilst not \ndirectly \nrelated to this question it is important for the Commons Select Committee to understand that illegal trade in wildlife has been strongly linked to other criminal activities such as the trafficking of weapons and drugs, and terrorism. \nIn November 2012, then\n Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that illegal wildlife\n \ntrade must be addressed at every level of the international community and declared illegal wildlife trade a national security issue. In May 2013, the UN Commission on Crime Prevention and Crimi\nnal Justice agreed to a resolution calling on the nations\n \nof the world to consider wildlife and forest crime a serious \nform of organis\ned crime. Also in a May 2013 report to the United Nations Security Council, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon highlighted t\nhe potential link between poaching and \nother transnational organis\ned criminal activitie\ns. Therefore any system that purports to manage legal trade, a trade that is a driver for illegal trade, \nmust ensure it\ns’\n systems are applied and effective.\n The existing\n regulatory framework and Code of Practice \nnot only \nprovides inadequate protection \nfor primates, it is also not effectively implemented; \nRSPCA research on the DEFRA \n‘\nCode of Practic\ne for the Welfare of Privately Kept Non-Human Primates\n’\n \nfound \nthat many Eng\nlish local authorities are either unaware of the Code, or don't use it.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nShould people be allowed to keep primates as pets and, if not, how a ban might be implemented.&#xa0;A wealth of evidence, supported by experts in primate health and welfare reject the view \nthat \nprimates can be kept as pets. Primatologists, conservationists, zoo professionals, \nv\neterinarians\n,\n primate\n \nrescue organisations and other respected professionals s\nupport restricting the keeping of primates to those with highly specialised knowledge, skills and facilities appropriate\n \nto the species\n, and only\n \nfor purposes of conservation or sanctuary\n.\n Primates are highly intelligent animals with complex needs that can\n't be met in a home environment and can suffer greatly. \nThere is considerable evidence to suggest that many keepers of pet primates lack the appropriate knowledge and/or facilities to adequately provide for their welfare. \nSoulsbury et al., 2009 in their sc\nientific assessment of the suitability\n of primates as pets in the UK \nconcluded that the practice should end.\n \nOver half of all incidents involving primates reported to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in the UK between 2001-2008, i\nnvolved species for which a license is not required, and over 60% involved \nprimates\n housed on their own. One UK sanctuary reports that all of the primates transferred to them from private keepers are suffering from either physical or behavioural problems (\nor both) including stereotypic behaviours. Many exhibit a tendency to exhibit self-harming behaviour.\n \n&#xa0;\nTher\nefore we should be focusing on the second part \nof the question, how should a ban be\n implemented. \nClearly given the large number of primates in private ownership, professional facilities would be overwhelmed and unable to cope with an immediate ban. A more practical approach would be to have a ban with a grandfather clause which would allow current pri\nvate owners that are adhering to \nthe \nAnimal Welfare Act (2006) to keep their (non-breeding) primates. This app\nroach would stop the trade, phase out private keeping of primates as pets, and allow the worst cases, those that are not being kept according to t\nhe Animal Welfare Act (2006)\n, to find sanctuary\n in a suitable and professionally run facility. \n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
