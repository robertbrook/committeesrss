"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written Evidence from Institute of Fundraising [CEP0010]&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.1\n&#xa0; \nThe Institute of Fundraising (registered charity in England and Wales (no.1079573) and Scotland (no. SC038971) \ni\ns the professional membership body for UK fundraising. Our mission is to support fundraisers, through leadership, representation, standards-sett\ning and education, and we champion and promote fundraising as a career choice.\n1.2\n&#xa0; \nThe Institute of Fundraising is the largest individual representative body in the voluntary sector, with over 5,500 individual members and more than 350 Organisational members. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1.1\n \nCharities in the UK raised £\n11.5 billion \nfrom \nindividuals through \ndonations\n, \nlegacies\n, and fundraising activities\n in 2010/11\n. This income is absolutely vital to charities, allowing them to deliver services and work to achieve their charitable\n objectives.\n&#xa0;\n2.1.2\n \nThe scope and breadth of the charity sector is huge. There are 163,000 registered charities in England and Wales, and of these the majority (over 120,000) have an annual income of less than £100,000.\n This variation within the charitable secto\nr makes \nmeaningful \ncomparisons between organisations of different sizes and causes \nimpossible\n and a ‘one size fits all’ approach to issues such as charity CEO pay should be avoided. \n&#xa0;\n2.1.3\n \nCharity CEO pay has generated press, political, and public interest since a series of articles beginning in August, starting with the Daily Telegraph article \nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10224104/30-charity-chiefs-paid-more-than-100000.html\n&#xa0;\n2.1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe question of\n \nwhat\n level of pay is ‘justified’\n is one\n which \neach and every charity trustee board \nhas \nto decide for themselves.\n Charity trustees h\nave a clear duty: \nTrustees have and must accept ultimate responsibility for directing the affairs of a charity, and ensuring that it is solvent, well-run, and delivering the charitable outcomes for the benefit of the public for which it has been set up.\n&#xa0;\n2.1.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPublic perception of the remuneration levels of senior staff is something which all charities will have due re\ngard to. However, \nthe most important factor for trustees in all the decisions they make has to remain \ndelivering \nthe maximum\n impact on \ntheir \ncharitable objectives. \nIf the trustees’ experience leads them to decide that this can best be achieved through paying a higher salary to senior staff than all of the public would be happy with, then this is a decision which the trustees need to have the co\nnfidence, legitimacy, and discretion to make.\n&#xa0;\n2.1.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGovernment have committed to \n‘Respect and uphold the independence of Civil Society Organisations to deliver their mission’\n.\n When commenting on the pay of senior executives in charities, all MPs should respect\n the right and ability of charity trustees to set pay levels that they deem appropriate, even if they do not agree with them personally. \n&#xa0;\n2.1.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn setting remuneration policies that are appropriate for their organisation, trustees do need to have the best infor\nmation and guidance to hand. As such, the Institute of Fundraising welcomes the inquiry currently being convened by NCVO to establish the principles that should guide trustees as they set pay levels for senior executives.\n&#xa0;\n2.1.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI\nt is hoped that the Inquiry prov\nides useful guida\nnce for trustees in setting pay, and gives reassurance to the Charity Commission and Government that charities have appropriate remuneration policies which are set according to best practice guidelines. \n&#xa0;\n2.1.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, the introduction of new g\nuidance, while welcome, will \nhave a limited effect on resolving\n \na wider issue. There is a gap of knowledge and understanding \nby the public on how charities work\n, particularly the \nlarger and more complex \ncharities,\n \nwhich needs to be addressed.\n  \n&#xa0;\n2.1.10\n&#xa0; \nPart of th\ne solution is for the charity sector as a whole to b\netter and more consistent\nly communicate\n \nwith\n donors so that those giving money have a greater level of information on what their donation is being spent on and the impact that the charity is having in del\nivering its mission. \nThe Institute of Fundraising has guidance on ‘Accountability and Transparency’\n which aims to help charities explain how they work and what they achieve. \n&#xa0;\n2.1.11\n&#xa0; \nWe also believe that future press stories or statements about senior pay within\n charities \nshould be \nmore contextualised. As the ACEVO Pay Survey Shows for \n2013 m\nedian CEO salary of £60k is small compared to many other comparable public sector salaries.\n Furthermore, the figure of a salary on its own can never tell more than a small p\nart of the story. \nInclusion of elements of the breadth of a charity’s work, the numbers of staff it employs, the complexity of its work (for example coordinating disaster aid relief to foreign countries) the \nnumber \nof people that benefit,\n and\n \nits impact, w\nould \nall provide useful context for the public and aid a greater understanding of the work of charities.\n&#xa0;\n2.1.12\n&#xa0; \nThought should also be given to the potential consequences of negative ideas and connotations being established amongst the public when the media do n\not provide this wider context. It is possible that some donors may have stopped giving money \nsince seeing the stories in the summer. Of course it is the donor’s right to give or not give as they chose, but we should be mindful of how media stories are rece\nived and how donors may react to them; every pound that is lost through a donor cancelling a direct debit, or choosing not to give in the future, is money that will directly affect that charity’s ability to deliver services to their beneficiaries or work t\nowards\n achieving\n their charitable objectives.  \n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nUK Civil Society Almanac 2013 \nhttp://data.ncvo.org.uk\n \nThe Essential Trustee: What you need to know, Charity Commission \nhttp://www.charity\ncommission.gov.uk/media/94159/cc3_lowink.pdf\n \nThe Compact \nhttp://www.compactvoice.org.uk/sites/default/files/the_compact.pdf\n \nhttp://www.institute-of-fundraising.org.uk/guidance/code-of-fundraising-practice/guidance/accountability-and-transparency-guidance/\nhttp://www.acevo.org.uk/leadingtheceoandchair?=&amp;nccsm=21&amp;__nccspID=1103&amp;erid=1672878&amp;trid=b9ad9dfc-dca9-4fff-bdf0-bff1e5466876\n"
