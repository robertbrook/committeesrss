"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the Pensions Ombudsman [PHS0033]&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThank you for your September letter about PASC's enquiries into complaints handling, in which \nyou ask \nfor my views on eight questions.\n&#xa0;\nBefore I respond to the questions, I should perhaps make it clear that I am replying personally and \nin my capacity as the holder of the joint posts of Pensions Ombudsman and Pension Protection \nFund Ombudsman. I am also presently Chair of the Ombudsman Association (formerly known as \nthe British and Irish Ombudsman Association). I am not representing the Association's views in \nthis letter.\n&#xa0;\n1\n \n. How do you share good practice with other Ombudsmen, t\no \nimprove processes \nand customer \nservice?\n&#xa0;\nWe have contacts with other ombudsmen's offices at several levels in the organisation. We \ninformally benchmark what we do against comparable ombudsmen through awareness of \ntheir and our KPIs. More formal benchmarki\nng is difficult because of differences in \njurisdictions, size of office, overall purpose etc. We use our network of friends in other \nbodies to gain awareness of work that they are doing and inform them of our work.\n We are active in the Ombudsman Association, which holds operational seminars and workshops that \ngive further insight (for example there is a seminar on quality in early December, with \npresentations from five offices).\n&#xa0;\n2\n. \nWhat are your views on the creatio\nn of a single access point for complaints \nto \nall ombudsmen? \n&#xa0;\nI do not think as single access point is practicable, for the following reasons.\n&#xa0;\nWhilst most ombudsmen's jurisdiction can be simply expressed - \"Housing\", \"Legal \nServices\", \"Pensions\", \"Local Gove\nrnment\" etc - actual jurisdictions are often highly \ncomplex, particularly at the margins. And in matters such as discretion *ether to \ninvestigate, pre-requisites for acceptance, time limits and so-on there are significant \ndifferences. There is a separate q\nuestion about whether these complexities are desirable, \nbut while they exist a single access point could not properly deal with every office's remi\nt \nand powers without \ndividing up its expertise and replicating, at least in part, present \narrangements of specialists in each ombudsman's work — even if at a single location, either \nreal or virtual. That being so, the sought for benefit of single access is lost. In effect the \nsingle \naccess point would be a conglomerate of the front ends of each office, with the same\n \nboundary questions and cross referrals as exist at present.\n&#xa0;\nAs an associated point, the different jurisdictions mean that different information is needed to decide \nwhether a complaint can be dealt with, so the application process could not be \neasily harmonised.\n&#xa0;\nExisting statutory jurisdictions may place limits on delegation of decisions and \ndiscretions about jurisdiction, so that they can only be made by the office's\n own staff. Non statutory \nschemes might need rule changes which they could not be compelled to make — and no \noffice could be compelled to participate in the single access point. So legislation would be \nnecessary to achieve comprehensive coverage. Without c\nomprehensive coverage the \neffectiveness of a single access point would be impaired.\n&#xa0;\nA solution to the difficulties above might be that the single access point would do no more \nthan point towards the ombudsman likely to be able to deal with the matter. But\n then each \nombudsman's office would have to follow up with much the same work as at present. So the \nsingle access point would add an extra tier. It would be little more than an optional portal —which may well be worth considering but is probably not what t\nhe Committee had in mind in \nasking the question.\n&#xa0;\n3. \nWhat are your views on whether or not there should be a single public services ombudsman in \nEngland, as there is in Scotland and Wales?\n&#xa0;\nI would be in favour. There is sufficient similarity of jurisdiction fo\nr there to be benefits in \nterms of efficiency, ease of access and clarity for the public. The arrangement works well in \nScotland and Wales. The one impediment to clarity is that there would be some no-\ndevolved matters concerning Scotland and Wales that nee\nd a home. Whilst the English public services ombudsman might seem the logical place for them (because they are \npresently with PHSO) that is not the only solution.\n&#xa0;\n4.\n \nWhat consideration have you given to the introduction of an EU \nDirective on ADR \nand are you \ntaking any action in response.\n&#xa0;\nWe are at the early stages of considering its impact on us (but very aware that\n \nimplementation is in early 2015). We have raised it with our sponsor department (DWP). Our present view is that our procedures and jurisdiction a\nre compliant (or can easily be \nmade to be). The bigger questions are (a) whether there are relevant contracts and services \nnot covered by ADR entities at present which should be brought within our scope and (b) whether processes adopted by new ADR entities\n in addition to the Directive's requirements will change the public's expectations of our own service.\n&#xa0;\n5.\n \nTo \nwhat\n extent do you think the Directive will allow better and meaningful comparisons in \nperformance and sharing of practice across providers or agencie\ns?\n&#xa0;\nIt would if there was proliferation of ombudsmen with similar characteriStics. (I mention \nabove the difficulties of benchmarking amongst ombudsmen with very different \ncharacteristics). But proliferation is not in the public interest (see below).\n&#xa0;\n6. \nTo \nwhat extent the Directive presents an opportunity to remodel the existing\n \nsystem of ADR\n \nto\n \nresolve possible existing overlaps, shortfalls and conflicts?\n&#xa0;\nOn its own there is a risk that the Directive will result in proliferation with \nadditional\n \noverlaps, shortfalls and conflicts. In my view there needs to be a clear \nstance that the \nGovernment does not expect that there should not be more than one ADR provider in any\n \nbusiness sector and that\n \nwhere there are sectoral similarities there s\nhould be a single \nprovider across sectors. Existing providers should be used where possible (but not in such a \nway as to encourage their jurisdictions to reach into very different services). See answer to question 8, below.\n&#xa0;\n7. \nHow can those involved in disput\ne resolution, but who aren't covered by the Directive, ensure that \nthey \nare meeting the same expected standards of quality as those who are covered by it?\n&#xa0;\nThe question assumes that the expected standards under the directive are higher than those \nthat would\n apply without it. I'm not at all sure that premise is correct — certainly amongst \nombudsman schemes.\n&#xa0;\n8. \nHow can the government ensure against the proliferation \nof excessive \nnumbers \nof \ndifferent dispute \nresolution bodies and mechanisms (and should it be doing\n so)?\n&#xa0;\nSee my answer to question 6 above. It is less than clear that the Government can do more\n \nthan discourage proliferation, since the directive does not place limits on the number of \nschemes registered with the \"competent authority(ies)\". However opinion formers, such as \nmedia and consumer bodies are likely to oppose the idea of competi\ntive ADR entities and \nthe Government should adopt the same position. Suppliers of goods and services are likely \nto be supportive too, since a simpler landscape, with entities maximising economies of scale, \nis in their interests.\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
