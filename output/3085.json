"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Martyn Underhill, Police and Crime Commissioner for Dorset&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;CRIME REDUCTION POLICIES – A CO-ORDINATED APPROACH&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSUMMARY&#xa0;\nA summary of my submission is as follows:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ1    “What is the Government’s approach to cutting crime? To what extent is the approach taken cross-departmental, and how are resources for such policies - from within and outside of the criminal justice system - allocated and targeted?”&#xa0;\n1.1\n              \nThe Government approach is a clear one – all police forces and partner agencies must cut crime. In many areas, the legislation and funding helps achieve that, however, I worry that poor performance and direction from other departments nationally and locall\ny divide and hinder the approach.  \n&#xa0;\nWestminster v Localism\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n              \nHealth and Education provide a confusing picture in the fight against crime. This is due to the Government localism agenda, which allows some Government departments to escape the main drive f\nrom the centre to cut crime. \n&#xa0;\n1.3\n              \nI shall give two examples:\n&#xa0;\n1.4\n              \nFirstly, mental health. Policing as a service and crime in general, is fed by incidents caused by people suffering from mental health issues. One in four people will have issues at some sta\nge in their life. Research has shown that such people will become victims more easily, and will re-offend more as offenders. The re-offending is because they are not treated, or diverted.\n&#xa0;\n1.5\n              \nTackle mental health issues nationally, and we can cut crime, a\nnd reduce the amount of people suffering from mental health who will become victims. There are other obvious benefits of a co-ordinated approach to this problem. However the issue of mental health care fails spectacularly because of a disjointed approach b\ny numerous departments. \n&#xa0;\n1.6\n              \nThis poor join up of objectives and budgets means that there is a “disconnect” between departments such as NHS England, Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCG’s), Local Authority Public Health and Mental Health Teams. \n&#xa0;\n1.7\n              \nThe po\nlice service, as an aside, then becomes the “service of last resort”. Police pick up Health Department issues such as people in crisis in public and private places, people in crisis in custody suites, and transportation of such people. All of these issues \ndetract from the police objective of cutting crime. \n&#xa0;\n1.8\n              \nThe Home Secretary has written and spoken many times about this issue, however, the disparate approach taken locally by the numerous Health Departments means that the issue floats between Government\n mantra and local funding agendas.  I watch with interest to see how the Health and Wellbeing Boards (HWBs) impact on this issue in the future. \n&#xa0;\n1.9\n              \nMy second example relates to education. The concept of academies and free schools has allowed such establi\nshments to devise their own curriculum. This means that a standard approach to PSHE nationally has been diluted and lost. I see completely different approaches to drug, alcohol, sex and cyber bullying education in \nDorset\n. \n&#xa0;\n1.10\n              \nThis causes inconsistencies in what children are taught, and more importantly, means that young adults are poorly equipped to make life choices. Poor life choices create both an increase in victims of crime and in youth offending. \n&#xa0;\n1.11\n              \nIt is interesting,\n that as I write this, the Deputy Prime Minister has raised the same issue.\n&#xa0;\nEarly Intervention\n&#xa0;\n1.12\n              \nI endorse the Government approach to Troubled Families.  Notwithstanding that, I would like to see it drive more Early Intervention (EI) through the cultu\nre of Community Safety Partnerships (CSPs), HWBs and Safeguarding Boards. \n&#xa0;\n1.13\n              \nWhilst I welcome the Troubled Family agenda, my issue is that to reach the high threshold of a Troubled Family, it is often too late to improve outcomes. I liken it to a house\n fire. By time you are a labelled a Troubled Family, the house is on fire, and all the authorities can do is attend to put the fire out. If you intervene early, and put in a smoke detector, you stop the fire. You stop the chaos taking hold. Pro-active earl\ny intervention must be better than reactively putting out a fire. And along the way you can change a generation of children, improving their outcomes for life.\n&#xa0;\n1.14\n              \nHere in \nDorset\n, we now have two out of three of our top tier authorities taking part in th\ne new Early Intervention Foundation pilots. Notably, these pilots come without funding. The two Authorities made these bids in conjunction with me. And I am now “pooling” budgets with these authorities to address EI.\n&#xa0;\n1.15\n              \nThe Government strategy to crime \nreduction fails to recognise the huge link between the 0-5 year olds, and the future. If all 0-5 yr olds went to school being able to read, write and talk properly (in other words, be “school ready”) they would have a different future. Children who are not\n school ready stay in the lower quartile for their whole school career, and leave school with low self esteem, low achievement and are the victims and offenders of the future. \n&#xa0;\n1.16\n              \nWe must be bold and link children’s education and esteem to the offenders\n and victims of the future. \n  \nIn \nDorset\n I am doing that by sharing resources and \ninformation. And the public get it, they understand where the issues lay, and how they can be solved. \n&#xa0;\n1.17\n              \nPooled funding enables the commissioning of joined up services which have tangible outcomes. These services can link into or bolster the initiatives the Committee have identified like \nHomestart\n and the Nurse Family Partnership to help achieve change. \n&#xa0;\nKee\np Catching Criminals / Keep Cutting Crime (KCC)\n&#xa0;\n1.18\n              \nAn area of concern for me is the need for the Government to drive catching criminals and detecting crime. This isn’t about introducing more statistics. It is about making sure the police do what the pub\nlic expect – detecting crime.  If you embrace Early Intervention as the mantra to changing outcomes in the future, then the Government should be instructing police and partners to catch more criminals. \n&#xa0;\n1.19\n              \nThis is\n \nn\no\nt about target setting it is about ac\ncepting that most crimes are committed by someone who has already broken the law, or by someone who could go on to commit more crime. If the police and partners are encouraged to catch more criminals, they can engage with the offenders, and change their ou\ntlook and lifestyle, to prevent more crime happening in the future. \n&#xa0;\n1.20\n              \nYou can only change offending behaviour if you intervene. Failure to catch criminals fails to tackle the problem. \n  \nThat is why I welcome the transforming rehabilitation (TR) change\ns that now bring offenders sentenced to less than 12 months into the rehabilitation programme. \n \n&#xa0;\n1.21\n              \nOn my election here in \nDorset\n, the police were only catching one in five offenders, in other words, 20% of crime was resolved satisfactorily. \n  \nThe \npublic were deeply unhappy with this statistic.\n  \nI therefore set a target in the Police and Crime Plan – I said I wanted one in three criminals caught instead of one in five by 2016. \n  \nIn response, the police changed their investigative procedures and intr\noduced “Operation Advance”. \n  \nAnd after a year, as well as driving crime down by over 8%, we have raised our resolved crime rate to 25%, in other words one in four. We are getting there. \n&#xa0;\n1.22\n              \nI call this approach KCC\n:\n Keep Catching Criminals as well as K\neep Cutting Crime.  In my view, having the two KCCs is essential. It drives the very essence of why you have a police force – The \n“prevention and detection of crime”.\n&#xa0;\n1.23\n              \nI welcome the Government recognising this crucial aspect of crime management.\n&#xa0;\nPart\nnership Working\n&#xa0;\n1.24\n              \nReduction of crime will always be a joint agency agenda. \n \nIf we accept that, then this is arguably the most successful angle of the current Government approach. The arrival of PCCs has enabled the concept of shared priorities to be cr\nystallised from the Police and Crime Plan. \n&#xa0;\n1.25\n              \nThe legislation has focussed partners on each other’s priorities, and I congratulate the Government on this approach.\n&#xa0;\n1.26\n              \nIn Dorset I am leading a drive for change in our partnership structure with a view to moving from three CSPs to one pan Dorset partnership, as indeed Merseyside have already done. This allows one partnership to drive forward key priorities and also makes c\nommissioning an easier process. \n&#xa0;\nQ2              How reliable is the evidence on which these policies are based?&#xa0;\n2.1\n              \nMainly good. I have huge respect for the Cabinet Office Policy Team. The Troubled Family ethos, EI, and the determination to drive down crime as drive\nrs of a better society are well founded by research.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nHowever, Evidence Based Policing is still in many ways in its infancy, and the Government needs to do more to raise its profile to enable Forces such as mine to share best practice. \n&#xa0;\n2.3\n              \nI do have \na concern that some Government Policy is driven by cost rather than research. A good example of this is the Transforming Rehabilitation Programme. I know \nAlun\n Michael has already raised the issue with your committee. Curtailing the payment by results pilot\ns, before completion, and proper evaluation has concerned people. Time will tell if the Government approach is the correct one. \n&#xa0;\nQ3              What impact have recent spending reductions had on the implementation of crime reduction policies, and the way in which resources for crime reduction are channelled at a local level?&#xa0;\n3.1\n              \nThis is a huge question. What is a crime reduction policy? Sarah’s Law and Clare’s Law are both fantastic crime preventers, but most people would not consider such initiatives in their “crime\n prevention or reduction toolkit”. \n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nI support the Anti Social Behaviour (ASB) approach being taken by this Government, and welcome the new community trigger. \n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nHowev\ner, one area does concern me - p\nan Dorset there is an issue with long term entrenc\nhed neighbour/boundary disputes that the law does not appear to cater for. Current legislation fails to tackle these complicated matters. This is even more the case if one or both parties own their own homes, removing the option of re-housing. I would like\n to see this addressed, by creating an arbitration system that will adjudicate. \n&#xa0;\n3.4\n              \nI am happy that the processes to “design out crime” are in place and working.\n&#xa0;\n3.5\n              \nI do worry that the traditional face of police crime prevention – the crime prevention officer – has suffered badly due to the cuts.  Most Forces have cut these roles, amalgamated them, or regionalised them, as we are doing in the South West. The best futu\nre for this in my view is a collaborative agency approach. \n&#xa0;\nSAIL\n&#xa0;\n3.6\n              \nIn Dorset, we have an initiative called Safe and Independent Living (SAIL) which is where different agencies such as the Fire Service, Police and Project for Older Peoples Partnerships use one form to identify issues in a household, which is then shared. A\nt the moment it relates to older people. \n&#xa0;\n3.7\n              \nWe need to embrace this principle, and get better at it. If one agency is liaising with a family or a household, the opportunity to identify concerns and share the issues is enormous, and could break down barr\niers between agencies. \n&#xa0;\nThe Late Night Levy\n&#xa0;\n3.8\n              \nI am concerned that the localism agenda has resulted in a total rejection nationally of the Late Night Levy (LNL). The LNL is welcomed by senior police officers and me as an important aspect of the crime re\nduction toolkit.\n&#xa0;\n3.9\n              \nThe LNL is recognition of the role a licensee plays in fuelling the alcohol issue in crime. The levy would achieve corporate responsibility of the issue, and fund policing efforts to tackle it. The LNL has failed universally because o\nf devolving the issue to Local Authorities, who are lobbied by local businesses. It is another example of Westminster v Localism. \n&#xa0;\n“Cloud Based” Case management system\n&#xa0;\n3.10\n              \nFinally, we all know that the issue of crime prevention, and detection, could be \nimproved by the introduction of a “cloud based” case management system used by all agencies involved with risk and harm. \n&#xa0;\n3.11\n              \nIn Dorset I am just trying to “pump prime” this principle, by introducing a software system (approved to Government stand IL3) b\netween agencies. The Probation Service, my office and the LRF currently use the system. To have one system that all agencies can use in a “Windows” based environment is the holy grail of all law enforcement agencies.\n&#xa0;Q4              What contribution do existing sentencing, prison and policies make to the reduction of crime?&#xa0;\n4.1\n              \nThe Integrated Offender Management (IOM) system does work, and police and probation are getting better at it. Most forces are seeing improvements in reoffending rates, and that is a good thing\n. \n&#xa0;\n4.2\n              \nThe good thing about the new TR proposals is that it brings forces together, and therefore best practice and common goals can change outcomes. For example, our new Community Rehabilitation Company (CRC) is based across Dorset and Devon &amp;\n Cornwall.  Devon &amp; Cornwall IOM practices differ in technique and resourcing to Dorset, and now the Chief Constable and I are aligning our IOM to match theirs. \n&#xa0;\n4.3\n              \nAs with cutting crime, the IOM process (and the prison process) fails to have the full su\npport or impact of Health Professionals.   If we accept that a huge amount of offenders are in a “cycle” due to addiction, then their health and wellbeing is crucial to stopping that cycle.  Resourcing of health professionals (outside of nurse/GP provision\n) inside prisons in Dorset is problematic. \n&#xa0;\n4.4\n              \nI await with interest to see what “through the gate” services come as part of the Community Rehabilitation Company (CRC) that is being set up.  The good news is that the new PCC role can “fill the gap” and c\nommission services to bolster and improve those being offered by the new CRC’s. I am heavily committed to mentoring as a way forward, and I applaud the “Circles” mentoring approach to reducing risk and harm in sex offending cases. \n&#xa0;\n4.5\n              \nI would like to hig\nhlight an anomaly in relation to sentencing however. I have already referred to the Westminster v Localism dilemma in relation to cutting crime. A dilemma in the area of sentencing is the Public v The Judiciary in relation to Neighbourhood Justice Panels (\nNJP’s). We are trialling two of these in Dorset. They have massive public support. Most victims welcome the chance to meet the offender in their case, and welcome a panel deciding on an appropriate sentence.\n  \nThese panels are quicker, and achieve better re\nductions in re-offending, than the traditional court based processes. \n&#xa0;\n4.6\n              \nThe dilemma is the role of magistrates. I feel that JP’s should sit on these panels to provide insight, experience and legitimacy to the process. However, the Judiciary are fiercel\ny protective over this, and will not allow JP’s to engage. \n&#xa0;\n4.7\n              \nAt a time when lower court sittings are reducing, at a time when most JP’s in Dorset struggle to achieve their “sitting hours” this seems a strange position for us to be in.\n&#xa0;\n4.8\n              \nThe Governme\nnt needs to intervene and push NJP’s forward as an excellent sentencing tool that is quick, cost effective, and achieves massive positive victim feedback. \n&#xa0;\n4.9\n              \nEqually, we need to see the Restorative Justice approach rolled out to all adult courts. We hav\ne seen how well the approach works with our young people.  \n&#xa0;\nQ5              How cost effective and sustainable are the Governments strategies for punishment and reform and their proposals for transforming rehabilitation?&#xa0;\n5.1\n              \nI applaud the TR proposals, with one exception. I worry that the feature of two different organisations, the National Probation Service, and the CRC in an area will allow an offender who rapidly changes risk category to “slip between the cracks”. \n&#xa0;\n5.2\n              \nA cloud based case management system is again the panacea here. \n&#xa0;\n5.3\n              \nI also applaud the victim surcharge, although I wonder why some courts convicting for offences without a victim are imposing the levy.\n&#xa0;\n5.4\n              \nI think the new Government approach to punishm\nent and reform is sustainable, as is the approach to closing cost prohibitive prisons. For example, HMP Dorchester will close soon, because it cost twice as much to keep a prisoner there in comparison to a newer prison. \n&#xa0;\n5.5\n              \nI do have a concern however, o\nver the prison estate. My concern was that HMP Dorchester was named as my “local” and “resettlement” prison for Dorset, and then the Government announced its closure.  I am now in a position, like other PCCs, that my County does not have local solutions fo\nr “through the gate” services. My nearest “local or resettlement” prison is now in another County. \n&#xa0;\n5.6\n              \nWhilst the logic of this from a cost point of view is obvious, it will hamper the efforts of the PCC and agencies to provide coherent local solutions t\no re-offending. \n&#xa0;\n5.7\n              \nThis is also the case in relation to commissioning. The CRC areas are very large, and small effective intervention organisations will struggle to tender for these services. \n&#xa0;\n5.8\n              \nI also have a concern about the new Government “super” \nprisons. If you accept that a prisoner’s “support network” is crucial to rehabilitation in the long term, then making the family travel 150 miles to see their loved one does raise issues, and could destroy the network. It also damages services that the PCC\n or other agencies want to commission.  \n&#xa0;\n5.9\n              \nAnd finally, in closing, I have reservations over the Government drive to separate victim and witness services. I know this has already been raised with you. Most PCCs want to see victim and witness commissioni\nng to be local rather than national. \n&#xa0;\nOctober 2012\n&#xa0;\n"
