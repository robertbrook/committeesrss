"VEP 0008\n&#xa0;\nWritten Submission by Dr Bharat Malkani (VEP 0008)&#xa0;\nIntroduction&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSummary&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten Submission&#xa0;\nQuestion One: What are the historical and philosophical justifications for denying prisoners the right to vote?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQuestion Two: Why is the right to vote considered to be a human right?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nQuestion Three: Is disqualifying prisoners from voting a suitable part of their punishment?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQuestion Four: What are the financial implications of maintaining the current ban in terms of claims by prisoners for compensation?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQuestion Five: Is sentence length a legally robust basis on which to retain an entitlement to vote?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQuestion Six: What would be the likely legal consequences, both domestically and internationally of:\n&#xa0;\na) keeping the law as it is? \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nb) passing legislation giving some prisoners the right to vote, but in a way that maintains a form of blanket restriction?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nc) seeking to comply by enfranchising the minimum number of prisoners possible consistent with our international legal obligations?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQuestion Seven: Would giving prisoners the right to vote have any significant administrative impact on either the prison system or the Electoral Commission?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQuestion Eight: Is there any evidence to suggest that allowing prisoners to vote would have a significant impact on particular constituencies?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQuestion Nine: What lessons can be drawn from the experience of other countries regarding prisoner voting? \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nConcluding remarks\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJune 2013\n1\n&#xa0;\n For example, ‘Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and the decision to prosecute’ (2011) 12 \nCriminal Law Review\n 943-956; ‘Sentencing children who kill: one giant leap for the US Supreme Court, one small step for international human rights law’ (2012) 12 \nHuman Rights Law Review\n 801-813\n For example, ‘A\n&#xa0;\nrights-specific approach to section 2 of\n&#xa0;\nthe Human Rights Act’ (2012) 5 \nEuropean Human Rights Law Review\n 516-528; ‘Human rights treaties in the English legal system’ [2011] \nPublic Law\n 554-577\n \nDeborah \nCheney, ‘\nPrisoners as Citizens in Democracy\n’\n (2008) 47 \nHoward Journal of Criminal Justice \n134\n \nPowell v Guest \n(1864) 144 E.R. 367, 372\n On this, see C.R.G.
