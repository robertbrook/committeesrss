The testing will generally prove the working of the changes to the EPM 2010 system after the SP1 update, such as the EPM configuration settings and any possible changes to the EPM system and the way users will work with the system, e.g. changes in the user interface.Testing will also perform basic functionality checks, to prove that the fundamental features can be accessed as before (Pre SP1 update).Data validation and integrity checks will also be performed:Testing will not be formally applied to standard, out-of-the-box functionality of MS Project and EPM, except where it is explicitly covered in the user guide.Testing will take place at various points, in the development cycle, first proving that the SP1 update along with the June 2011 cumulative update works, resolves known issues without any adversities within Pre Production.  PED (validation) as well as PICT Change Advisory Board approval will be sought, moving towards verification that everything actually works in the final, updated production EPM system.This forms the main approach to testing the EPM 2010 SP1 update and signing it off as ready to go-live.

[[[Test Formulae custom fields work as they should (lessons learnt) ]]]Notes:Updated and publish a project (Test Baseline – PE55555) and reviewed the following calculated fields:NextCPNextCPPlanNextCPFcastCPnStatusCPnStatusData

[[[Check out projects in MS project clients and undertake updates (look at changes)]]] Notes:Updated and published PE55555 successfully.Undertook schedule updates using PWA schedule as well as updated all three PDP pages successfully.However, When I attempted to make changes in the schedule PDP page – project task dates (CP date milestone) the PWA schedule page doesn’t refresh with this new data until you click edit. As well as that, the ‘CPnStatus’ field in the EPM views doesn’t refresh either. This is not an immediate concern at this stage as EPM users are advised not to use the PWA schedule (as there are still issues/bugs  with the PWA Schedule).

[[[Test MS Project Professional 2010 Client connects to EPM 2010 server]]]Notes:This works well, however, within PPE I am unable to checkout a Project from the PWA (using the web client) as done in Live. I think this is a PPE domain issue. To get around this, I can actually check out a Project via opening the MS project Client and using the Open&gt;&gt;retrieve Project from project Server route as oppose to clicking open on a selected project within a PWA Project centre view.

[[[Verify and check Project plan data]]]Notes:&#xa0;

[[[Verify and check appr]]]

[[[opriate views ]]]

[[[contain correct data (Projects)]]]Notes:Views seem to have the correct data however; I have noticed that there seems to be a change in how Project server records ‘Not Baselined’ tasks. Before SP1 Non Baselined tasks would be stored with a date and time as: ’00:00:00 or 01/01/00.Now in the View (post SP1) the Non Baselined Tasks are showing as: ‘30/12/99’.Although, I doubt this will have an adverse effect on the results contained within EPM, I will undertake more investigations regarding this to find out what the impact (if any) is and why there is a difference. 

[[[Verify (where possible) the permission levels for Project data access i.e. that the new security model still applies (using Test account)]]]Notes:Have checked the EPM Security group’s permissions still work and they do.I checked the Project Leader group which is used to filter the My Projects view 1 to show only projects assigned to owner – working.&#xa0;I also checked that this security group could see and edit their own projects – workingI added the Project Leader Buddy and assigned the test user (assigned to the Project Leader Buddy group) to a project not owned by the test user – the test user could then edit the project he was assigned as a buddy (team assignment). – working.Removed the Project Leader buddy settings to which the test user could then only edit his Project.   &#xa0;Put the test user in the PED Project Support group (only) and the test user could only edit those projects assigned to as team member and view (no edits) those projects not assigned team member – Working.&#xa0;

[[[Update project within PWA]]]Notes:Working. However, Project Schedule updates is still recommended to be done in MS Project professional as there still appears to be some issues with the Scheduling engine in PWA and how it calculates formulated fields.

[[[Assign team members via Project Pro and PWA]]]NotesAssigning team members via MS Project pro works as it should and security permission settings related to this will be applied. However, although assigning team members via the PWA works, for some reason the security permissions related to team members does not apply. This is the same as pre SP1 and is not the cause of the SP1 update. Further investigations about this will be undertaken as a BAU issue (as project/team member assignments continue to be used) – Working as before.&#xa0;
