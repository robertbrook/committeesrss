"&#xa0;\nWritten Evidence Submitted by Eurogroup for Animals&#xa0;Submission Date: 14 January 2014&#xa0;\nOrganisation overview\nEurogroup for Animals is an international, non-governmental organisation that acts as the leading voice for \nanimal welfare at the European Union level providing a voice for the billions of animals kept in laboratories, farms and homes or living in the wild. As a federation of 40 animal welfare organisations across Europe\n, we mobilise millions of citizens to def\nend the welfare of animals and act to ensure European, national and local decision makers take note and respond to our concerns.\n  \n&#xa0;\nReason\n for written submission\nAs an animal welfare policy organisation, we believe strongly that scientific evidence exists \njustifying the prohibition of primates as pets. \nSeveral of our member organisations operate rescue centres and sanctuaries for confiscated and unwanted exotic pets\n and are well\n-\nacquainted with welfare suffering of primates being unsuitably kept as pets. A few of these organisations (e.g. RSPCA, One Kind, Stichting AAP) will be submitting\n detailed\n evidence directly on this issue\n regarding the number of animals rescued and related \nwelfare concerns. Therefore, we are focusing our submission of evidence to studies and statements by experts documenting the risks of primate pet keeping and related trade. Furthermore, we provide evidence of \nthe regulatory actions by other European countr\nies to restrict the keeping of primates as pets.\n&#xa0;\nExecutive Summary\n&#xa0;\nComments\nPrimates are highly intelligent animals with specialised dietary, social and environmental needs that are difficult, if not impossible, to meet in a household environment. Primates of all ages and size can pose a significant physical and health threat to o\nwners. Many primates, including great apes, are still sourced from the wild, threatening wild populations \nand contributing to biodiversity loss\n. \n&#xa0;\nHealth &amp; safety risks to humans\n&#xa0;\nPrimates pose a significant health risks to humans due to their phylogenetic\n proximity. Furthermore, they can inflict severe bites and injuries to humans. A bibliogra\nphic review of zoonotic disease\n risks from exotic pets commissioned by Eurogroup for Animals identified a number of zoonoses (diseases spread between animals and huma\nns) documented in primates, including: rabies, monkey B virus, tuberculosis, Ebola virus, as well as zoonoses transmitted through bites and parasites\n.\n&#xa0;\nEndangered species \n&#xa0;\nThe trade in primates for pets has been linked to wild population declines in many\n species. One of the most endangered primates, the Barbary macaque (\nMacaca sylvanus\n) from North Africa\n,\n is suffering drastic declines due to \nhabitat loss and \nthe illegal pet trade to Europe\n,\n. The Trade Sustainability \nImpact Assessment of the free trade \nagreement currently being\n&#xa0;\nnegotiated between the EU and Morocco documents this illegal trade\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nUNEP’s Great Ape \nSurvival Partnership report, Stolen Apes, estimates that 3000 chimpanzees, gorillas, bonobos and orangutans are lost \n(\neither sold, killed duri\nng the hunt, or dying in captivity)\n&#xa0;\nfrom the wild in Africa and Asia each year\n. \nExamining confiscation records, international trade databases, law enforcement reports, and arrival rates from sanctuaries and rehabilitation centers between 2005 and 2011, \nthe report estimates that for every chimpanzee confiscated or confirmed in illegal trade, 10 more animals died during the capture\n or trafficking. Markets for tourist entertainment, disreputable zoos and pets are generating the demand and illegal permits ar\ne often used to traffic wild animals. \n&#xa0;\nLegislative restrictions on the keeping of primates\n&#xa0;\nIn 2012, Eurogroup for Animals conducted a\n comprehensive legislative review on the keeping and sale of exotic animals in 31 European countries\n. The analysis\n found \nthat 22 countries restrict keeping\n of exotic animals as pets\n based on negative lists of prohibited species\n. Belgium is the one country that regulates keeping via a positive list of acceptable mammal species (this list does not include primates). \nThe competent authority in Belgium has noted that a positive list has been a cost-effective and useful enforcement approach to regulating pets, as the public \nreports illegal sales online and in pet shops\n. \nPeople holding species not on the positive list at\n the time of its adoption were allowed to maintain their animals provided they registered them with the competent authority\n.\n \nThe Netherlands has announced it will switch to a positive list for mammals in 2014 (primates are not allowed to be kept)\n. \n&#xa0;\nSeve\nral countries have included primates (or certain groups of primates) on their negative lists\n of species which cannot be kept as pets\n, including: Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, \nFrance, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, and Sweden. The report contains tables summarising restrictions on the keeping and sale of exotic animals across European countries, as well as one-page country summ\naries on legislative restrictions and \nfuture legislative plans. An Executive \nS\nummary brochure is also available\n.\n&#xa0;\nScientific studies examine primate pet keeping and use in entertainment\n&#xa0;\nA University of Bristol study on the welfare and suitability of \nprimates kept as pets concluded “it is unlikely that the welfare of pet primates can be adequately addressed in normal households” and argued the practice should end (Soulsbury et al. 2009)\n. \nIt noted that the majority of primate-related complaints received by the RSPCA between 2000-2005 concerned neglect. This might suggest owners are unaware and perhaps incapable of meeting the complex needs of primates in a household setting. \n&#xa0;\nA study \nby Sc\nhroepher et al. 2011\n \nexamining the use of chimpanzees in entertainment (e.g. movies, commercials, print advertisement) \nsuggested a strong distortion in the public’s view of chimpanzees as endangered species and suitability as pets\n. It noted the use of med\nia \nwith chimpanzees interacting with humans as “pets” \nin non-range countries may \nencourage animal traffickers and poachers in range countries to capture infants for this market. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nScientists and veterinarians caution against primate pet keeping\n&#xa0;\nIn 2013,\n the Federation of Veterinarians of Europe issued a policy statement calling on competent authorities to establish lists of animals to regulate the keeping of companion animals. It noted positive \nlists may be preferable and that lists should be based on sc\nientific criteria including “risks for the animals itself, its owners and the society, the indigenous species and ecosystems.”\n&#xa0;\nIn the United States, a consumer information program on exotic pet choices called PetWatch\n was developed by EcoHealth\n Alliance, an international organization of scientists focused on the conservation of biodiversity by examining the relationships between, wildlife, ecosystems and human health. A team of scientists conducted searches on \ngeneral, popular, industry and acad\nemic databases to acquire information\n&#xa0;\non four criteria (\nsource sustainability, invasion threat, animal welfare and health threat) \nto generate a list of \nthe Best, Fair and Worst choices of exotic pets. \nThe primate species assessed (\ne.g. common marmoset, rhe\nsus macaques, squirrel monkeys) \nwere all classified as “worst choices” and not recommended for pet keeping. \n&#xa0;\nConfiscated and unwanted pet primates\n&#xa0;\nSeveral of Eurogroup for Animals’ member organisations \nfacilitate the \nrescue \nof \nconfiscated and unwanted pet primates each year. As \nstated\n \nabove, \nsome of these groups will be submitting written evidence directly\n and we would refer you to their submissions\n for data on the trade and keeping in the UK\n and related conclusions on the effec\ntiveness of the current \nregulations and \ncode of practice\n. An indication of the types of \nmammals (including primates)\n in need of rescue\n in other EU Member States\n can be found in the data published online by Stichting AAP (one of our Dutch member \norganisatio\nns\n): \nhttp://www.aap.nl/english/rescued-until-now.html\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://eurogroupforanimals.org\n, (including several organisations active in the UK: Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, One Kind, Dogs Trust, International Fund for Animal Welfare, World Society for the Protection of Animals and Human\ne Society International)\n Praud, A, and Francois Moutou (2010) ‘Health Risks from New Companion Animals’, Eurogroup for Animals. \nhttp://eurogroupforanimals.or\ng/files/policies/downloads/65/zoonotic-risk-report.pdf\n van Lavieren, E and S.
