[normal]INTRODUCTION
[normal]GENESIS AND PURPOSE OF THE CHARTER AND THE UK GOVERNMENT APPROACH TO IT
[normal]NOT NEW RIGHTS
[normal]“
[normal]In so far as this Charter contains rights which correspond to rights guaranteed by the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the meaning and scope of those rights shall be the same as those laid down by the said Convention. This provision shall not prevent Union law providing more extensive protection.” 
[normal]The effect of this is that where rights are based on the European Convention Rights they are, notwithstanding distances of language (to the extent that those exist which is in fact minimal), the same. The provisions have to be interpreted in exactly the same way.  This includes necessarily by reference to
[normal] the 
[normal]jurisprudence of the European Convention on Human Rights.
[normal]THE DECISION IN AB V SECRETARY OF STATE
[normal]“The j
[normal]udge said, however, that the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg has since given a judgment which means that the Charter, which contains a ‘host of new rights’ is now valid in British courts.”
[normal]“
[normal]The constitutional significance of this decision [in reference to an ECJ decision I discuss below] can hardly be overstated.  The Human Rights Act 1998 incorporated into our domestic law large parts, but by no means all, of the European Convention o
[normal]n
[normal] Human Rights.  Some parts were deliberately missed out by Parliament.  The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union contains, I believe
[normal],
[normal] all of those missing parts and a great deal more.  Notwithstanding the endeavours of our political representatives 
[normal]at
[normal] Lisbon it would seem that the much wider 
[normal]C
[normal]harter of 
[normal]R
[normal]ights is now part of our domestic law.  Moreover, that much wider 
[normal]C
[normal]harter of 
[normal]R
[normal]ights would remain part of our 
[normal]domestic law even if the Human Rights Act were repealed.”
