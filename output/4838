[normal]  
[normal]I represent no organisation
[normal].  
[normal]1985-1995 I was Special Adviser to the Home Office on Police Curricula and the Promotion Exams for Sergeants and Inspectors
[normal].  
[normal]During that time 
[normal]I retrained police trainers nationally 
[normal]after PACE and Scarman.  
[normal]I was then Police
[normal] Ombudsman
[normal] for those exams
[normal]Since then I have been a
[normal] University
[normal] Honorary Fellow in Police Studies, a volunteer inspector of detainees in police cells, a Neighbourhood Watch Coo
[normal]rdinator and a member of a PA.  
[normal]I read in the Times for November 20
[normal]th
[normal] 2013 that Mr Jenkin was shocked by police fabrication of crime statistics.  
[normal]On 14/12/2013 the Times ran an article headed “Met silences the PC who exposed ‘fiddled’ figures”.  For 14 ye
[normal]ars 
[normal]I have researched 
[normal]the consequences
[normal] 
[normal]of suspicious crime statistics in Tshire,
[normal] the bullying of a potential whistleblower
[normal], the apparent collusion and cover-up by all public institutions concerned,

[normal]What I find is a
[normal]n alleged
[normal] 
[normal]conspiratorial 
[normal]chain of 
[normal]criminal 
[normal]collusion where
[normal] professional and 
[normal]inter-professional
[normal] loyalties are more important than the truth
[normal] or the rights of lay
[normal] citizens
[normal].  
[normal]I have reason to believe this is part of a wider malaise.  I suggest a response
[normal], albeit an inadequate one
[normal].  
[normal]Events[bold]2[bold]              
[normal]Suspicious statistics.  [bold]I
[normal]n the 
[normal]mid
[normal] 1990s 
[normal]Tshire
[normal], a relatively small rural constabulary,
[normal] appear
[normal]ed
[normal] to 
[normal]be 
[normal]reporting
[normal] very high levels of 
[normal]Violence Against the Person (
[normal]VAP
[normal])
[normal] and high levels of detected crime, when compared with similar areas of the country.  
[normal]Probably
[normal] responsibility for their presentation lay with the Deputy Chief Constable (DCC), Assistant Chief Constable 
[normal](
[normal]ACC
[normal])
[normal], Chair of the Police Authority (C
[normal]hair
[normal]), the PA Clerk and the 
[normal]Detective Chief Superintendent
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3[bold]              
[normal]The Chief wanted a review.  [bold]The raw figures 
[normal]went unnoticed amongst those for the big cities.  
[normal]However w
[normal]hen I calculated VAP per 1000 population (which the Home Office did not do) the anomaly stood out.  
[normal]Yet
[normal] a
[normal] 
[normal]newly
[normal] arrived
[normal] C
[normal]hief Constable
[normal], 
[normal](CC)
[normal] 
[normal]did notice.  He 
[normal]funded 
[normal]a review 
[normal]and asked Officer PWB
[normal] t
[normal]o set up a short list of potential researchers
[normal].  
[normal]Reportedly the DCC was livid.  
[normal]DCC 
[normal]and ACC, with the apparent support of the 
[normal]Clerk
[normal] and 
[normal]Chair
[normal], 
[normal]made 
[normal]a 
[normal]complaint
[normal] 
[normal]against 
[normal]the 
[normal]CC
[normal] 
[normal]regarding 
[normal]the
[normal] contract
[normal] to investigate statistics
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]Officer Potential Whistleblowe
[normal]r (PWB)
[normal] 
[normal]had information to
[normal] falsify
[normal] this complaint
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4[bold]              
[normal]Bullying a potential whistleblower.  [bold]Tshire’s 
[normal]Complaints and Discipline Department
[normal] (
[normal]C&amp;D
[normal])
[normal], reporting to DCC,
[normal] 
[normal]started to investigate 
[normal]PWB
[normal],
[normal] his 
[normal]estranged wife 
[normal]and 
[normal]family
[normal].  
[normal]PWB believes t
[normal]hey looked at 
[normal]his, his 
[normal]family
[normal]’s
[normal] 
[normal]and his wife’s business 
[normal]bank accounts, telephone records, utility bills, 
[normal]community charges, 
[normal]tapped their phones
[normal], told the Inland Revenue 
[normal]without evidence 
[normal]they were guilty
[normal] 
[normal]of “widespread tax evasion”,
[normal] 
[normal]made 45 house to house enquiries about
[normal] their marriage; and told their son’s local education authority
[normal] 
[normal]240
[normal] miles away
[normal] 
[normal]to withdraw his 
[normal]university 
[normal]grant.  L
[normal]ater 
[normal]they
[normal] prosecuted 
[normal]PWB
[normal] and 
[normal]his 
[normal]wife 
[normal]regarding a
[normal]n innocent
[normal] university grant application
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]The 
[normal]C&amp;D
[normal] also tried to caution their children for a
[normal]lleged offences related to this application. 
[normal] PWB
[normal] observed that 
[normal]C&amp;D
[normal]’s
[normal] 
[normal]interview transcripts sent to the CPS had over 100 excisions.  One interview was reduced from 62 to 15 pages.  
[normal]The effect 
[normal]and purpose 
[normal]was to discredit 
[normal]PWB
[normal].  His evidence 
[normal]about
[normal] 
[normal]the contract 
[normal]relating to
[normal] criminal statistics 
[normal]was never 
[normal]asked for or 
[normal]obtained.  
[normal]It seems the Chair and Clerk 
[normal]of the PA 
[normal]arranged
[normal] a
[normal] pension and resignation agreement with CC 
[normal]that compelled absolute secrecy
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5[bold]              
[normal]PWB’s complaint.  [bold]Wanting to complain PWB 
[normal]wrote
[normal] to the Home Secretary.  He did not believe anyone would investigate the depth and thoroughness
[normal] with which the 
[normal]C&amp;D
[normal] persecuted his family.  
[normal]So he decided to
[normal] include
[normal] as much evidence as he could in the complaint itself.  It ran to over 200 pages and containe
[normal]d 132 specific allegations in bold underlined text 
[normal]against the DCC, ACC, 
[normal]CC’s 
[normal]successor
[normal] 
[normal](
[normal]CC
[normal]2
[normal])
[normal], the 
[normal]Clerk, Chair
[normal]man and 
[normal]named 
[normal]members of the 
[normal]C&amp;D
[normal] 
[normal]alleging misfeasance in public office
[normal] 
[normal]includ
[normal]ing
[normal] details of 
[normal]an 
[normal]alleged 
[normal]conspiracy[bold] to incriminate 
[normal]PWB
[normal], his wife and his children, to induce false confessions, to maliciously prosecute Mrs 
[normal]PWB
[normal] and her children
[normal], to pervert justice, to abuse process, and to subvert evidence by 
[normal]making 
[normal]the
[normal] excisions
[normal] from interview transcripts
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6[bold]              
[normal]Perverting the course of inv[bold]estigation.   [bold]Email
[normal]s 
[normal]allege
[normal] that 
[normal]in an abuse of process 
[normal]the Home Office discussed the Complaint with at least one of those accused, probably the Clerk.  
[normal]Because the Police Complaints Authority (PCA) was not empowered to investigate 
[normal]an alleged conspiracy of
[normal] 
[normal]junior officers, ACPO officers and PA members, t
[normal]he 
[normal]Home Office 
[normal]sent 
[normal]the Complaint 
[normal]to HMIC who
[normal], the Minister said
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]“does have locus to recommend the appointment of an investigating officer in such cases”
[normal].  HMIC
[normal] consulted
[normal] two alleged 
[normal]conspirators
[normal], 
[normal]the Clerk
[normal] and 
[normal]CC2
[normal], 
[normal]and 
[normal]referred 
[normal]the Complaint 
[normal]to the 
[normal]PCA
[normal].  Arguably th
[normal]ese three
[normal] perverted justice because 
[normal]the conspiracy
[normal] itself
[normal], 
[normal]ACPO and PA members were no longer investigated
[normal].  Arguably too
[normal],
[normal] HMIC 
[normal]had 
[normal]thereby 
[normal]joined the conspiracy.  
[normal]Yet the conspirators still had to sideline PWB’s 200 pages of information and its 132 specific allegations.  
[normal]The CHMIC said the HMI had neither authority nor power to conduct such enquiries; 
[normal]“These are matters for the Chief Constable”
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7[bold]              
[normal]HMIC sent
[normal] no co
[normal]py of the Complaint
[normal] to the PCA.  
[normal]Consequently
[normal],
[normal] the PCA had no idea 
[normal]who 
[normal]was complained of
[normal], what the complaints
[normal] were
[normal], or any of the evidence
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]A 
[normal]Deputy Chairman of the 
[normal]PCA
[normal] (PCA1)
[normal] wrote to 
[normal]PWB
[normal].  
[normal]She says t
[normal]he Clerk 
[normal]and
[normal] 
[normal]CC
[normal]2
[normal]’s
[normal] new DCC, 
[normal]DCC
[normal]2
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]attended a meeting
[normal] 
[normal]t
[normal]o advise the PCA and 
[normal]a 
[normal]DCC 
[normal]from
[normal] 
[normal]Constabulary
[normal] 
[normal]A
[normal].  This DCC
[normal] confirms
[normal] 
[normal](private communication) that 
[normal]the Clerk 
[normal]and DCC
[normal]2
[normal] 
[normal]sat through that meeting without saying 
[normal]t
[normal]he 
[normal]Clerk 
[normal]was one of those accused. 
[normal] Effectively DCC
[normal]2
[normal] was 
[normal]thereafter
[normal], if not 18 months earlier,
[normal] 
[normal]also 
[normal]a member of the alleged conspiracy.  
[normal]Th
[normal]us the
[normal] 
[normal]alleged 
[normal]conspiracy widens.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8[bold]              
[normal]Deputed as the 
[normal]“
[normal]Appropriate Authority
[normal]”
[normal], DCC
[normal]2
[normal] ignored 
[normal]PWB’s
[normal] 
[normal]original
[normal] Complaint and 
[normal]selected
[normal] new allegations based on a
[normal]n invited
[normal] supplementary statement 
[normal]by 
[normal]PWB
[normal].  
[normal]PWB 
[normal]and 
[normal]I
[normal] 
[normal]sa
[normal]y
[normal] the
[normal] 
[normal]allegations
[normal] were 
[normal]trivial, uninvestigable and 
[normal]selected to fail
[normal].  One 
[normal]fabrication 
[normal]was against a
[normal]n inspector in another force
[normal] of whom 
[normal]PWB
[normal] made no mention
[normal] 
[normal]or
[normal] complaint
[normal].  It 
[normal]showed knowledge only possessed by officer
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]C&amp;D
[normal]3
[normal] and C&amp;D4
[normal].  
[normal]D
[normal]espite repeated requests
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]t
[normal]he number and 
[normal]content
[normal] of these misrepresentations was kept secret by PCA
[normal]1’s
[normal] successor
[normal],
[normal] PCA2
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]and DCC2 who appeared to be in collusion
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9[bold]              
[normal]In other words the alleged offender
[normal]s
[normal] themselves
[normal] chose the items for investigation
[normal].  
[normal]We 
[normal]allege
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]PCA
[normal] enquiry was 
[normal]pe
[normal]rverted
[normal] by the alleged 
[normal]conspirators
[normal] before it started.  
[normal]Th
[normal]is
[normal] alleged corrupt
[normal]ion
[normal] had a momentum 
[normal]PWB
[normal] was powerless to stop.  
[normal]PCA2
[normal] refused to consider there was any corruption.  
[normal]Constabulary
[normal] 
[normal]A finished their report within a year
[normal].  Without
[normal] its author
[normal]’s knowled
[normal]ge,
[normal] it appears 
[normal]Officer
[normal] W of Tshire
[normal], reporting to DCC2,
[normal] secretly changed it to prevent more complaints.  
[normal]The
[normal] alleged criminal conspirator
[normal], CC2,
[normal] owned the report
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10[bold]              
[normal]To circumvent
[normal] this power, PWB’s MP and PWB 
[normal]asked to meet
[normal] the Minister
[normal] personally
[normal] to 
[normal]show[bold] evidence of what was happening.  
[normal]Hitherto
[normal] the Home Office’s 
[normal]abuse of process 
[normal]seemed to me 
[normal]somewhat
[normal] partial.  This would test it
[normal].  
[normal]The Minister
[normal] 
[normal]refused to see us
[normal] after 15 months
[normal].  S
[normal]he 
[normal]said she got her 
[normal]information from Tshire police
[normal], the PA, the PCA and the
[normal] IPCC.  She 
[normal]fail
[normal]ed
[normal] to appreciate that all these sources got their informatio
[normal]n from one source, 
[normal]DCC2
[normal].  Her description 
[normal]omits his role in paras 7, 8 and 9 above
[normal] thereby protecting alleged senior conspirators
[normal].  
[normal]This left me questioning the moral integrity of 
[normal]the Home Office 
[normal]officials upon whom
[normal] ministers must depend.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11[bold]              
[normal]The IPCC protects the [bold]alleged [bold]conspirators.  [bold]The IPCC undertook a 
[normal]r
[normal]eview these events
[normal].  
[normal]Though arguably in the public interest, 
[normal]a
[normal] IPCC 
[normal]Commissioner 
[normal]has refused to release 
[normal]even a summary of 
[normal]it
[normal]s 
[normal]findings
[normal], 
[normal]citing Parliament’s Freedom of Information and Data Protection.  
[normal]Why not? 
[normal] 
[normal]I sincerely believe
[normal] 
[normal]there is 
[normal]concealment of offences 
[normal]to protect 
[normal]alleged 
[normal]criminal 
[normal]conspirators
[normal].  In effect
[normal] 
[normal]a
[normal] Commissioner 
[normal]join
[normal]ed
[normal] the 
[normal]alleged 
[normal]conspiracy.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12[bold]              
[normal]In 2003
[normal] and again 
[normal]i
[normal]n 
[normal]2004
[normal] 
[normal]PWB
[normal] further complained that 
[normal]C&amp;D
[normal]3 and 
[normal]C&amp;D
[normal]4
[normal] lied to the High Court
[normal] 
[normal]in a libel case against me
[normal], 
[normal]when 
[normal]claim
[normal]ing
[normal], amongst many things,
[normal] there were no excisions
[normal] 
[normal]from the 
[normal]PWB
[normal] family’s interview transcripts
[normal].  
[normal]The 
[normal]2004
[normal] complaint set out 
[normal]the 
[normal]alleged
[normal] criminal 
[normal]implications
[normal] 
[normal]against
[normal] ACPO 
[normal]and 
[normal]PA 
[normal]officers.  
[normal]T
[normal]he IPCC Commissioner avoided these implications by only investigating
[normal] th
[normal]e 
[normal]2003
[normal] complaint
[normal] under the 1996 Act
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]not the latter
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]Again 
[normal]I believe 
[normal]the IPCC 
[normal]Commissioner 
[normal]protected alleged 
[normal]senior 
[normal]conspira
[normal]tors
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13[bold]              
[normal]Officers from another force
[normal] wrote a very lengthy report that the 
[normal]IPCC 
[normal]Commissioner has also 
[normal]refused to release
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]As with the Review
[normal],
[normal] PWB
[normal] might ask, 
[normal]‘
[normal]If there is nothing incriminating in it
[normal] why can’t it be open; and if there is, what is it?
[normal] and what
[normal] is the IPCC’s duty
[normal] regarding it
[normal]?
[normal]’
[normal]  
[normal]T
[normal]he
[normal] IPCC
[normal] 
[normal]found
[normal] no law prohibiting lies in the High Court, 
[normal]and 
[normal]then t
[normal]old
[normal] 
[normal]PWB 
[normal]there was insufficient evidence that officers 
[normal]“knowingly and deliberately”
[normal] made the excisions.  
[normal]I c
[normal]a
[normal]n’t 
[normal]understand
[normal] how they made them unknowingly.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1[bold]4[bold]              
[normal]After 
[normal]yet
[normal] more e
[normal]vidence was supplied it appears 
[normal]C&amp;D
[normal]3
[normal] 
[normal]gave the IPCC nearly full transcripts (here called [f]) 
[normal]claiming
[normal] to be copies of those sent to the CPS (here called [a]).  The IPCC accepted them as such.  The Comm
[normal]issioner and
[normal] his caseworker 
[normal]refused to send copies for 
[normal]PWB’s
[normal] scrutiny even though, if truly genuine, 
[normal]PWB
[normal] should have received 
[normal]them 
[normal]when released by the CPS
[normal] 
[normal]a decade earlier
[normal],
[normal] instead of 
[normal]receiving 
[normal]th
[normal]ose with excisions
[normal].  
[normal]Later 
[normal]we got copies via the IPCC’s Lon
[normal]don Information Officer.  Thus we have two sets of transcripts.  We can show 10 different kinds of evidence that [f] 
[normal]were not sent to the CPS
[normal].  
[normal]C&amp;D3 must know that.  So should the Commissioner
[normal] and his caseworker
[normal].  
[normal]The Commissioner’s suggestion that 100+ ex
[normal]cisions were made by the CPS 
[normal]attempts to protect 
[normal]C&amp;D
[normal]3
[normal], but so beggars belief that it undermines his own credibility
[normal].  
[normal]For what possible motive would anyone at the CPS have to go through every 
[normal]interview 
[normal]transcript cutting out bits to change the meaning of what was said (13), and to hide evidence of innocence (31), oppression (34), implanted false information (10), errors (7), solicitor interventions (14), fishing (17), lies and misrepresentation (14), oth
[normal]er abuses of process and police malpractice (33) 
[normal]for the sole purpose of sending
[normal] 
[normal]a 
[normal]deception to the 
[normal]PWB
[normal]s?  And did the CPS then complete new 
[normal]accompanying 
[normal]MG15(T)
[normal] forms
[normal], Exhibit lists, forge 
[normal]C&amp;D
[normal]3’s
[normal] signature, re-type all transcripts,  re-stamp all paginatio
[normal]n and stamp Exhibit Nos with a stamp they probably don’t possess?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1[bold]5[bold]              
[normal]The alleged conspiracy is not over.  
[normal]After 
[normal]I 
[normal]report
[normal]ed
[normal] this 
[normal]alleged 
[normal]forgery 
[normal]as a crime in 2012 two more Gwent officers 
[normal]wrote to protect their colleagues
[normal] and 
[normal]then 
[normal]refused further correspon
[normal]dence
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1[bold]6[bold]              
[normal]So much for 
[normal]a few of the 
[normal]document
[normal]ed
[normal] 
[normal]facts 
[normal]as I see them
[normal]. 
[normal] The implications 
[normal]and questions 
[normal]are so diverse I cannot get my head round them.  
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Interpretations, I[bold]mplications[bold] and Comments[bold]1[bold]7[bold]              
[normal]The innocent suffer most.  [bold]This is a case of bullying, 
[normal](a)
[normal] not of a whistleblower, but a 
[normal]potential whistleblower
[normal]; 
[normal](b)
[normal] of 
[normal]his estranged wife
[normal] and her children
[normal] who
[normal] have, and had, nothing to do with Tshire Police or their crime statistics.  They lived 240 miles away.  They are powerless to battle against the pilla
[normal]rs of the criminal justice system
[normal], the very people employed to maintain standards and protect them
[normal].  
[normal]Parliament allows no challenge to an IPCC conclusion except JR.  
[normal]How can they 
[normal]afford
[normal] justice?
[normal]  
[normal]What can PWB do?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1[bold]8[bold]              
[normal]Responsible [bold]profession[bold]als appear [bold]crimin[bold]ally [bold]collusive[bold].  [bold]My allegations, mostly of perverting justice, are against 
[normal]up to 20 members from 
[normal]Tshire’s Complaints and Discipline Department, its Standards Department, ACPO officers, 
[normal]the 
[normal]PA, HMIC, the IPCC, the Home Office and the P
[normal]C
[normal]A.  
[normal]There needs to be
[normal] an impartial investigation, but 
[normal]none of these organisations can be trusted
[normal] to do it
[normal].  
[normal]None has shown moral integrity.  Who should take responsibility now?  The Home Secretary?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]19[bold]              
[normal]What motiv[bold]ates[bold] members of these organisations to collude?[bold] 
[normal] 
[normal]How 
[normal]and why
[normal] [bold]does this conspiracy work?  
[normal]Do all the
[normal] people 
[normal]involved 
[normal]know each other?  I doubt it.  
[normal]Yet they 
[normal]protect each other.  
[normal]They don’t know Mrs PWB either
[normal] but there is no loyalty to her.  S
[normal]he doesn’t matter to them.  
[normal]L
[normal]ike racism,
[normal] ‘She’s not one of us’.

[normal]A [bold]m[bold]is[bold]placed loyalty and power are prioritised above truth and justice.[bold] [bold]Psychologists call this phenomenon, ‘Groupthink’.  It commonly unites bullying groups.  It is characterised by pressures to conform, 
[normal]perceived 
[normal]safety in group membership, 
[normal]a sense of power, 
[normal]r
[normal]ationalised self justification,
[normal] a belief in group unanimity, self censorship, belittlement of others
[normal], self denial, a belief in their own morality and sometimes ‘mindguards’ who actively prevent expression of dissent.  There may also be laziness: ‘It must b
[normal]e OK if all those people think so’.  Arguably Hillsborough and Met Police also offer examples.

[normal]‘Collusion’ or ‘corruption’?[bold]  
[normal]By saying “collusion” I have carefully stopp
[normal]ed short of saying “corruption”.  
[normal]But when 
[normal]those 
[normal]in positions of governmental 
[normal]public service
[normal] protect each other
[normal] in breaking the law
[normal], and 
[normal]then use their position and power to 
[normal]pressure conform
[normal]ity by others,
[normal] 
[normal]is 
[normal]that the essence of a corrupt state
[normal]?
[normal]  
[normal]I cannot prove it, but w
[normal]hatever the word, if the paperwork had fallen 
[normal]on
[normal] other 
[normal]governmen
[normal]tal
[normal] desk
[normal]s
[normal] I believe the forces of ‘Groupthink’ would have applied just the same
[normal].  It is too much for me to believe a remarkable coincidence that the paperwork always fell to collusively vulnerable individuals.  
[normal]And that is all the more alarming because mos
[normal]t of the individuals in question are in senior positions.  If the media asked me, ‘How near is corruption to the top of these governmental institutions?’ I should have difficulty in giving rational assurance.

[normal]2[bold]1[bold]              [bold]The neglected moral values of policing.  [bold]  Part of the problem is that the police, public and government have 
[normal]a one-sided 
[normal]TV 
[normal]view
[normal] of what policing should be.  The police are seen as an organisation responding to incidents, catching and prosecuting offenders.  
[normal]These are the values of power.  
[normal]They 
[normal]are that
[normal] of course
[normal], but 
[normal]police should offer
[normal] far more than that.  Police should offer protection and the provision of needs. 
[normal] Many do.  
[normal]These are the values of 
[normal]care, 
[normal]compassion and service.  
[normal]PWB 
[normal]and his family 
[normal]got none of that.  Police need both.  
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2[bold]2[bold]              [bold]Whit[bold]her reform? [bold]If s
[normal]o who is in any position to change
[normal] this unprofessional 
[normal]collusive 
[normal]counter-culture
[normal]? 
[normal] No one.  
[normal]Individuals have
[normal] to change 
[normal]themselves
[normal].  Chang
[normal]ing
[normal] values cannot be imposed.  Opportunities can be created, that is all.  It is
[normal] a massive task.  The f
[normal]irst step is Truth and Reconciliation using 
[normal]the methods of 
[normal]Restorative Justice
[normal].  
[normal]Without them
[normal],
[normal] do we have a long inquiry and even longer 
[normal]criminal 
[normal]trials?
[normal]  And what would th
[normal]ey
[normal] do?  
[normal]We need procedures that can support a culture in changing itself. 
[normal] That seems lacking.  
[normal]Attitude change is by far the most difficult task in adult education.  It needs taking empl
[normal]o
[normal]yees out of their comfort 
[normal]zone for say two weeks, requiring them to decide upon ambiguous decision scenarios, 
[normal]indentifying and clarifying in 
[normal]d
[normal]iscussion the moral principles implied
[normal],
[normal] and the beginning of each day 
[normal]devoted to
[normal] shared inner reflection in a group of up to 30 similarly engaged.  I have done this work when re-training police trainers
[normal].  It requires very careful of preparation of scenario
[normal]s, but can be rewarding in the long run.

[normal]Conclusion[bold]  
[normal]Statistics for Domestic Violence should be distinguished from other VAP.  
[normal]Crimes per population could aid interpretation.  
[normal]I believe what began with 
[normal]suspicious crime statistics 
[normal]has led to 
[normal]a long ru
[normal]nning criminal conspiracy
[normal] amongst relatively senior members of
[normal] 
[normal]police related professions.  There is no effective redress for its victims.  Correspondence shows the police know that and trade upon it.  Thus there is power without adequate restraint, a reci
[normal]pe for corruption.  
[normal]Secrecy is the vehicle of conspiracy.  I believe its 
[normal]legitimised use is excessive and needless
[normal].  M
[normal]ore than statistics
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]ultimately it is these issues and flaws in procedures that need parliamentary attention.
