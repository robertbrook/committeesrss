[normal]Additional information about the Open University
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Although scientific research in academia
[normal] can require long hours, there are opportunities to 
[normal]introduce the
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]flexibility
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]to do the work at different times and from different locations. It is important to let go of assumptions about where work gets done and how it is done.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The OU has a strong track 
[normal]record in flexible working and remote working using technologies because of our distributed structure
[normal]. Academic staff based in our 13 regional and national centres can regularly join meetings and collaborate on both teaching and research via our internal v
[normal]ideo and audio conferencing systems. All meetings at our Milton Keynes campus are held within core hours to allow for travel 
[normal]which has the additional benefit for those who need flexibility for caring commitments.
[normal] Our
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Open Science 
[normal]Laboratory
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]is at the forefront of developing new research methods and pedagogies for conducting experiments at a distance.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Between 2005 and 2011
[normal] 
[normal]the Open University
[normal] ran a programme 
[normal]for women 
[normal]returning to STEM careers after a career break
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]in 
[normal]which
[normal] over 1000 women 
[normal]STEM graduates 
[normal]participated
[normal]. 
[normal]As well as 100 hours of online learning,
[normal] the women, who had previously worked in a range of STEM professions both in academia and industry,
[normal] were able to interact in online forums, and meet each other at local networking events.Â  A 
[normal]r
[normal]ecent evaluation
[normal] showed 
[normal]over 70% of women had
[normal] return
[normal]ed
[normal] to employment in STEM
[normal] five years after takin
[normal]g part in the programme. 
[normal]This
[normal] was an externally funded project and w
[normal]e would recommend further funding to support such initiatives in future.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Open University hosts, edits and publishes the 
[normal]International Journal of Gender Science and Technology
[normal]. This was originally set up in 2009 and funded via the UK Resource Centre for Women in SET and since the funding ended in 2011 has continued to be support
[normal]ed by 
[normal]T
[normal]he Open University in recognition of the important role this journal plays in bridging the boundaries between policy, practice and research. As an open access free online journal we are able to disseminate robust peer reviewed international research
[normal] to a wide community of stakeholders to help inform developments in this area.
