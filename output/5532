[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Dear [bold]Sir[bold]KPMG LLP—[bold]Further[bold] written evidence[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Further to my letter of 23 January in which, o
[normal]n behalf of KPMG in the UK, I respond
[normal]ed
[normal] to 
[normal]Part 2 of 
[normal]the 
[normal]above call for evidence
[normal], I now set out 
[normal]our comments 
[normal]on part 1 
[normal]below
[normal]. As you have previously been informed, I shall be attending in person at 3.30pm on 5 February to give 
[normal]oral
[normal] evidence on behalf of KPMG.
[normal]2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is our understanding that the changes proposed in 
[normal]Finance Bill 2014 have arisen for two reasons:
[normal]■
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The significant difference in tax rates between companies (20% from 1 April 2015) and individuals (45% for additional rate taxpayers plus National Insurance 
[normal]C
[normal]ontributions (NIC) where appropriate
[normal]) has caused 
[normal]some LLPs to distribute profits to
[normal] corporate members
[normal] owned by 
[normal]individual 
[normal]members rather than to 
[normal]individual 
[normal]members themselves; and
[normal]■
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The different NIC treatment bet
[normal]ween self employed individuals, including partners in a partnership,
[normal] and employees
[normal] 
[normal]relate
[normal]d
[normal] to 
[normal]employers
[normal]’
[normal] contribution
[normal]s of 13.8%
[normal] has caused some LLPs to appoint individuals as members who HMRC believe should more properly be taxed as employees.
[normal]3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]stated 
[normal]policy objective is to prevent th
[normal]e
[normal] avoidance described above
[normal] and we have been advised by HMRC 
[normal]t
[normal]hat it is not intended to impact upon the taxation of 
[normal]genuine 
[normal]equity partners.
[normal] 
[normal]We support the policy objective.  We have also been advised that the approach taken in drafting the legislation has been to base it on case law principles with the intention of 
[normal]creating a relatively straightforward, forward looking test which can be applied year on year.  
[normal]We support this approach and believe that the three factors used in the draft legislation of profit sharing, management and capital are, on balance, those most 
[normal]prominently featured in previous case law. 
[normal]4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However,
[normal] as currently drafted we do not believe that the legislation achieves its aim.  It is too vague and is not capable of being interpreted without the use of the supporting guidance.  The guidance itself exp
[normal]ands rather than merely clarifies the scope of the legislation.  This is bad law and we believe that it will result in the 
[normal]legislation hav
[normal]ing
[normal] far wider scope than its st
[normal]ated intent
[normal].  In effect 
[normal]it does have the capacity to impact 
[normal]significant numbers of genu
[normal]ine
[normal] equity partners
[normal]. 
[normal]5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] The individuals from HMRC who have been tasked with this job appear to welcome 
[normal]input and to be willing to make amendments where they will improve both the legislation and the guidance.  However, we believe that the current proposed t
[normal]imetable of an effective date of 6 April 2014 means that insufficient changes will be feasible and that only solution is to defer the introduction of the legislation, ideally until Finance Bill 2015, while this further work is carried out.
[normal]I set out our co
[normal]ncerns in more detail below.
[normal]Legislation[bold]6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The
[normal] 
[normal]draft legislation is 
[normal]very broadly drafted and has few defined
[normal] terms.  
[normal]For 
[normal]example
[normal] 
[normal],a
[normal] key phrase upon which much of the discussion lies is the phrase “substantially wholly”
[normal] in s863B(1)(b)
[normal].  This is not defined in
[normal] the legislation but is stated unequivocally in the guidance to mean 80%.  
[normal] In addition, 
[normal]during discussions, HMRC have clarified that a factor which will determine whether condition A applies or not (
[normal]s863B(
[normal]1)-(3)) is whether an individual is paid in priori
[normal]ty to his fellow members.  This is not mentioned in the legislation but could be included relatively easily
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The legislation includes a capital test (Condition C).  Broadly a member requires capital in excess of 25% of any disguised remuneration in order to fail the condition and avoid becoming a salaried member.  We believe that the level of capital required in 
[normal]this test discriminates unfairly against non capital-intensive businesses and those firms which manage cash flow efficiently.  There is a risk that including this test will drive firms to adopt uncommercial behaviour
[normal] as it may encourage firms to require me
[normal]mbers to inject capital, notwithstanding that this may not be needed by the business.  
[normal]8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The
[normal] capital
[normal] test also only allows 
[normal]formal 
[normal]capital to be included in the calculation. We disagree that only fixed capital is relevant. Large amounts of funding for workin
[normal]g capital and investment come not from capital subscriptions made by partners, but from the retention of internally generated funds otherwise payable to partners, such that at any point in time the total investment by the partner group significantly exceed
[normal]s the formal capital which they inject. This deferral of payment is a feature which distinguishes partners from employees (employees would expect to receive the vast majority of their remuneration during the year rather than after the year-end).  For examp
[normal]le, the Statement of Financial Position at page 48 of KPMG’s Annual Report for the year ended 30 September 2013 shows that while the formal capital contributed by members was £50m, the total members’ interests were £354m.  
[normal]The balance of £304m represents t
[normal]he net of unallocated or undrawn profits.  We believe that any capital test should allow all of these interests to be classed as capital.
[normal] 
[normal]9
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The legislation is drafted by reference to tax years.  The tax basis period for LLPs is the accounting period.  This 
[normal]is also the period for which many LLPs agree member remuneration structures and capital.  We believe that the legislation will be easier to apply for both taxpayers and HMRC if it were redrafted by reference to accounting periods and therefore recommend th
[normal]at this is done.
[normal]10
[normal] 
[normal]Some firms
[normal],
[normal] including KPMG
[normal],
[normal] award retiring partners fixed profit shares or priority payments in their final year of membership or agree the profits of that final year at the time of retirement rather than following the end of the year when
[normal] profits are known. 
[normal] While in some instances it will be the case that no further services will be performed by the member following the agreement (see 
[normal]s862B(
[normal]1)(a)), this is not always the case as a notice period may be worked.    The current legislation
[normal] wi
[normal]ll 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]give rise to the anomalous situation that individuals may be genuine equity partners and taxed as such for many years, but that they are taxed as employees in their final year of membership.  We strongly recommend an exemption from the provisi
[normal]ons for anyone in their final 12 months of membership provided they have not been a salaried member in any of the previous three (say) years.
[normal]11
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The introduction of specific rules taxing individual members on profits allocated to a non individual member of a 
[normal]partnership
[normal] is anticipated to 
[normal]cause difficulties for many mixed partnerships because the legislation
[normal] 
[normal]is 
[normal]intentionally 
[normal]aimed at taxing commercial 
[normal]arrangements, as well as structures specifically designed for tax avoidance.  Examples of commercial arrangemen
[normal]ts caught by the new rules include allocations of profits to corporates for working capital purposes, investments, or deferred profit arrangements.
[normal]12
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, the legislation has been drafted with anti-avoidance mainly in mind, as the legislation requires th
[normal]e taxpayer to consider whether it would be reasonable to conclude that the reason some or all of the excess profits have been allocated to the corporate is attributable to the relationship between the corporate and the individual member.  Then, only a just
[normal] and reasonable 
[normal]allocation of the excess profits is taxable on the individual member.
[normal]13
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This style of drafting is appropriate for tax avoidance legislation, where a degree of flexibility is required.  However, where the legislation has a purpose of raising additional tax from commercial arrangements it is not appropriate to have such subjecti
[normal]ve tests.  Such subjective concepts give rise to a high level of uncertainty as to how the legislation applies to a commercial situation.  
[normal]We believe that these should be removed as they do not make good legislation.
[normal]14
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In summary we believe that, while the a
[normal]pproach taken is drafting the legislation has the potential to achi
[normal]e
[normal]ve clarity and restrict application to the stated policy group, it does not do so as currently drafted.
[normal]Guidance[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]15
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The guidance supporting the draft legislation is 56 
[normal]pages
[normal] long.  While we
[normal] welcome the principle of HMRC issuing guidance (and acknowledge that we would have raised concerns about lack of clarity if none had been issued) we do not believe that the guidance as currently drafted performs its correct 
[normal]purpose
[normal].  This should be to cla
[normal]rify the legislation rather than to extend it.
[normal]  As the guidance is not regulated by Parliament there is a risk of interpretation by HMRC which is not in accordance with Parliament’s wish.
[normal]16
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Despite its length the guidance itself does not clarify certain key 
[normal]points.  We have submitted several additional examples and questions to HMRC in an attempt to obtain certainty on our own position and that of many of our clients.  We attach as 
[normal]an 
[normal]appendi
[normal]x
[normal] 
[normal]a 
[normal]cop
[normal]y
[normal] of
[normal] some
[normal] additional examples 
[normal]we have 
[normal]submitted 
[normal]to HMRC to da
[normal]te.
[normal]  We do not believe that the
[normal] 
[normal]guidance take
[normal]s
[normal] account of the wide variety of different commercial arrangements many firms have agreed within their partner group.
[normal]  In addition, the guidance does not cover any of the practical issues which will arise for LLPs in applying the new legislation such as the amounts upon which PAYE and NIC must be paid or the interaction with for example the overlap rules for members who 
[normal]are now treated as salaried members.
[normal]17
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We believe that, once changes and improvements have been made to the legislation, the guidance should be rewritten to reflect the revised legislation, taking account of a far wider range of commercial arrangements.
[normal]Timi[bold]n[bold]g[bold]18
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In the consultation in the summer
[normal] of 2013
[normal] HMRC initially proposed that there should be a series of tests based on the case
[normal] law definition of an employee b
[normal]ut
[normal],
[normal] following representations, the test published on 10 December solely looks at three factors
[normal], pro
[normal]fit sharing, management and capital.
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]e are pleased that 
[normal]some 
[normal]representations have been listened to
[normal] and agree that the three factors selected do represent the most appropriate elements of existing case
[normal] law
[normal]. However, 
[normal]t
[normal]he introduction of these new tests
[normal] with
[normal]out an extension of the timetable for 
[normal]introduction 
[normal] allows
[normal] insufficient time for further consultation to be carried out, necessary amendments to be made to improve the application of the legislation and for taxpayers to understand and act on the implicatio
[normal]ns.
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he new rules
[normal] were published on 10 December 2013 and
[normal] are due to be effective from 6 April 2014
[normal] although the legislation will not become law until Royal Assent in July 2014.  
[normal]We understand that following the current consultation process which ends on 4 
[normal]February, revised legislation or guidance
[normal] will be issued by mid-February.  We do not consider that this will provide HMRC with long enough to consider the various representations being made. If revisions are delayed until 
[normal]the time of the budget on 19 March
[normal] there will be 
[normal]less than three
[normal] weeks before
[normal] the legislation will become effective
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]19
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This timing is unsatisfactory for two reasons.  The first is that it is retrospective
[normal] both because i
[normal]t applies from a date before it is fully enacted
[normal] but also because it app
[normal]lies to arrangements already in place before it will be enacted (or, in some cases, published)
[normal].  The second is that HMRC are unable to provide clearances for firms until after Royal Assent 
[normal](although HMRC 
[normal]have agreed to provide informal guidance) 
[normal]meaning th
[normal]at firms will be required to operate the legislation with uncertainty. We believe that this places an unnecessary administrative burden on all LLPs, which would be substantially reduced if the legislation we
[normal]re
[normal] deferred
[normal].  
[normal]While we understand the need for anti-avoidance legislation to be enacted quickly to prevent avoidance, this legislation goes far further than an anti-avoidance provision would normally go and affects many businesses who are not engaged in avoidance.  
[normal]We 
[normal]t
[normal]herefore 
[normal]believe that any deferral should be to Finance Bill 2015 as this would allow su
[normal]ff
[normal]icient time for further consultation, redrafting and clarification
[normal].
[normal]              [bold]Conclusion[bold] 
[normal]20
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In summary therefore we believe that
[normal]:
[normal]■
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]significant further work needs to be done to re
[normal]fine the legislative approach and draft focussed legislation which meets the policy objective (but does not go wider);
[normal]■
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]the 
[normal]non-statutory guidance
[normal] should be redrafted to ensure that it simply clarifies rather than extends the legislation; and
[normal]■
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]time
[normal] must be m
[normal]ade to do this by postponing the introduction of any legislation until these improvements are made. 
[normal]21
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]KPMG has found the individuals responsible for this legislation at HMRC (Richard Rogers and Brian Stokes) to be open and 
[normal]to welcome 
[normal]discuss
[normal]ions of
[normal] 
[normal]our conc
[normal]erns
[normal].  
[normal] I would like to reaffirm our willingness to continue working with them and their colleagues to achieve this objective.
[normal]Yours faithfully

[normal]and Pensions
[normal]KPMG additional examples tranche 1 – [bold]Condition A[bold]              [bold]              [bold]              [bold]              [bold]       [bold] Appendix[bold]Example 1a: basic example[bold]A, B and C are members of ABC LLP.  A is allocated 2 points and B and C are each allocated 4 points.  Regardless of the level of profit A will receive 20%, while B and C will receive 40% each.  
[normal]All three members receive no disguised 
[normal]remuneration,
[normal] they each have a variable interest in the overall profits of the partnership.
[normal]Example 1b: ‘benchmark’ and variable amounts[bold]A, B and C award themselves ’salaries’ of £20,000, £40,000 and £40,000 respectiv
[normal]ely and agree that the total profit will be shared in proportion to those salaries.
[normal] If the overall profits of the partnership are more or less than £100,000 then each partner will share in the deficit or surplus in proportion to their agreed salary.  
[normal]This
[normal] arrangement is in substance identical to example 1a: each partner has an interest in the profits of the partnership which is variable by reference to the overall profits of the partnership.  It is not relevant that the partnership has chosen to describe t
[normal]his arrangement by reference to a salary.
[normal]Example 1c: guaranteed amounts[bold]Continuing example 1b, individual D joins the LLP.  He is also awarded a ‘salary’.  His total profit share will be calculated as a proportion of the total profits of ABC LLP in the sa
[normal]me way as A, B and C but in his first year he is guaranteed a total profit share of no less than £30,000.  If his allocated share of the profits is less than this it will be borne by the other members; D will receive his profit share in priority to A, B an
[normal]d C.
[normal]D’s guaranteed profit share of £30,000 is disguised salary as it is fixed.  Accordingly, unless it is reasonable to expect that ultimately D’s share for the period will exceed £37,500, such that his overall return is not substantially wholly fixed, he
[normal] will meet Condition A.
[normal]Example 1d: capped variable interests[bold]E joins the LLP described in 1b above. 
[normal]Like D, s
[normal]he is awarded a 
[normal]‘
[normal]salary
[normal]’
[normal]. Her total profit share will be calculated as a proportion of the total profits of ABC LLP in the same way as A, B and C 
[normal]but her total profit share cannot exceed £25,000.  
[normal]As E is sharing directly in the overall profits of the partnership up to a certain point and her profit share is not paid in priority to the other members she will not meet Condition A unless, in practice
[normal], the overall profits of the partnership are expected to be such that she will 
[normal]realistically 
[normal]always receive £25,000
[normal].  If this were so, it would imply that her total received was not in practice a variable share of total profit equal to her ‘salary’ as a fr
[normal]action of all salaries, but was simply a fixed sum meeting Condition A.
[normal]Example 1e: businesses with stable or reliable profits[bold]Same as example 1b above, but the profit forecast is reliable or the nature of the business is such that profits are not signific
[normal]antly variable from year to year such that it is unlikely that profits will be materially greater or less than £100,000.
[normal]The fact that the overall profits of the business may be accurately forecasted and/or are stable from year to year does not mean that C
[normal]ondition A is necessarily met: each of the partners has an interest in the partnership which will vary with the overall profits of the partnership, even if those overall profits are predictable or are not significantly variable.
[normal]Example 1[bold]f[bold]: timing differen[bold]ces between cash and profit[bold]Facts as 
[normal]1b above
[normal].
[normal] However
[normal], 
[normal]the ‘salaries’ are distributed in-year.  It is agreed that to the extent there are insufficient 
[normal]profits,
[normal] excess
[normal] drawings will only be 
[normal]satisfied 
[normal]out of future profits of the firm
[normal] (meaning the drawings 
[normal]in the following years would be less than the affected members’ profit allocations)
[normal]. 
[normal]The distribution to members of drawings representing advances against allocations 
[normal]of  profit
[normal] share does not of itself change the position from that in 1b.
[normal]Example 2: disc[bold]retionary awards[bold]Please see attached marked-up versions of Examples 1A and 14 from HMRC’s 10 December Guidance.
[normal]Example [bold]3a: sharing in divisional profits only[bold]AB LLP has four members 
[normal]A
[normal], B, C and D.  A and B work in division X and C and D work in division 
[normal]Y.  Division X generates profits of £10
[normal],000
[normal] and Y of £90
[normal],000
[normal].  
[normal]The LLP deed provides that
[normal] A and B will share the profits of division X and that C and D will share the profits of division Y.  
[normal]All four members meet condition A as none of them receive a shar
[normal]e of the overall profits of the firm.
[normal]Example [bold]3[bold]b[bold]: whole firm profits shared on discretionary basis between members of divisions (i)[bold]The facts are the same as example 
[normal]3
[normal]a except that 
[normal]the LLP deed provides that profit allocation is at the discretion of the 
[normal]members.  T
[normal]he four members 
[normal]meet and, as per their terms of reference, they consider a range of factors including the financial performance of each division, the need for the divisions to work together and support each other, and the overall strategic direc
[normal]tion of the firm. They 
[normal]agree
[normal] 
[normal]that A and B will share profits of £
[normal]15,000
[normal], leaving C and D to share £
[normal]85,000
[normal].
[normal]Assuming the members have properly exercised their discretion under terms of reference based on more than just divisional profit sharing, they will n
[normal]ot meet condition A as their profit shares are each partly dependent on the overall profits of the whole firm.
[normal]Example 3c: whole firm profits shared on discretionary basis between members of divisions (ii)[bold]The 
[normal]facts are the same as example 3b
[normal] except that
[normal] t
[normal]he 
[normal]four members agree
[normal] 
[normal]that A and B will share profits of £
[normal]1
[normal]0
[normal],000 while 
[normal]C and D 
[normal]will
[normal] share £
[normal]9
[normal]0
[normal],000
[normal].
[normal]The four members will not meet condition A as their profit shares are still partly dependent on the overall profits of the entire firm,
[normal] 
[normal]notwithstanding that 
[normal]the resulting shares are the same as if profits were shared on a purely divisional basis.
[normal]Example [bold]3d: part divisional, part pro-rata split[bold]The facts the same as above example 3a except that the four members agree in advance that half of each division’s pro
[normal]fits will be split between the partners in that division, and half will be pooled and split equally between all the partners. Using the example above, A and B are therefore allocated £17.50. C and D are allocated £32.50.
[normal]We see two possible interpretations
[normal] of the legislation, either:
[normal]The four members will now not meet condition A as their profit shares are partly dependent on the overall profits of the entire firm.
[normal]Or:
[normal]The firm’s total profit should be treated as two amounts.  The first, 
[normal]division
[normal]ally alloca
[normal]ted amount then meets Condition A while the second, 
[normal]equally split 
[normal]amount does not.  The relative proportions of the two amounts for a member will determine whether that member meets Condition A.
[normal]Example [bold]4[bold]a[bold]: bonus pool for high performers[bold]A is a member of 
[normal]XY LLP. A receives a fixed share of £90,000
[normal] the terms of which result in it being considered to be disguised salary
[normal]. XY sets aside a proportion of profits each year as a 
[normal]bonus pool to reward high performing members.  Whilst the 
[normal]overall 
[normal]pool will vary with 
[normal]profits, the 
[normal]share of that pool 
[normal]allocat
[normal]ed
[normal] to 
[normal]an 
[normal]individual member will depend on their individual personal performance.  All members are eligible to receive a share of this profit pool and A typically receives a bonus ranging from £25,000 to £35,000 each y
[normal]ear. 
[normal]A will 
[normal]not meet
[normal] condition A as less than 80% of her expected profit share is fixed.  
[normal]Example [bold]4[bold]b[bold]: infrequent bonuses[bold]The same conditions as in 3a but 
[normal]A
[normal] only occasionally receives a bonus allocation.
[normal]A will meet condition A as her expected profit shar
[normal]e is just her fixed share.
