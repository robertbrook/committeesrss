defaultn behalf of KPMG in the UK, I respond
defaulted
default to 
defaultPart 2 of 
defaultthe 
defaultabove call for evidence
default, I now set out 
defaultour comments 
defaulton part 1

default. As you have previously been informed, I shall be attending in person at 3.30pm on 5 February to give 
defaultoral
default evidence on behalf of KPMG.
default2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is our understanding that the changes proposed in 
defaultFinance Bill 2014 have arisen for two reasons:
default■
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe significant difference in tax rates between companies (20% from 1 April 2015) and individuals (45% for additional rate taxpayers plus National Insurance 
defaultC
defaultontributions (NIC) where appropriate
default) has caused 
defaultsome LLPs to distribute profits to
default corporate members
default owned by 
defaultindividual 
defaultmembers rather than to 
defaultindividual 
defaultmembers themselves; and
default■
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe different NIC treatment bet
defaultween self employed individuals, including partners in a partnership,
default and employees
default 
defaultrelate
defaultd
default to 
defaultemployers
default’
default contribution
defaults of 13.8%
default has caused some LLPs to appoint individuals as members who HMRC believe should more properly be taxed as employees.
default3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthe 
defaultstated 
defaultpolicy objective is to prevent th
defaulte
default avoidance described above
default and we have been advised by HMRC 
defaultt
defaulthat it is not intended to impact upon the taxation of 
defaultgenuine 
defaultequity partners.
default 
defaultWe support the policy objective.  We have also been advised that the approach taken in drafting the legislation has been to base it on case law principles with the intention of 
defaultcreating a relatively straightforward, forward looking test which can be applied year on year.  
defaultWe support this approach and believe that the three factors used in the draft legislation of profit sharing, management and capital are, on balance, those most 
defaultprominently featured in previous case law. 
default4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever,
default as currently drafted we do not believe that the legislation achieves its aim.  It is too vague and is not capable of being interpreted without the use of the supporting guidance.  The guidance itself exp
defaultands rather than merely clarifies the scope of the legislation.  This is bad law and we believe that it will result in the 
defaultlegislation hav
defaulting
default far wider scope than its st
defaultated intent
default.  In effect 
defaultit does have the capacity to impact 
defaultsignificant numbers of genu
defaultine
default equity partners
default. 
default5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default The individuals from HMRC who have been tasked with this job appear to welcome 
defaultinput and to be willing to make amendments where they will improve both the legislation and the guidance.  However, we believe that the current proposed t
defaultimetable of an effective date of 6 April 2014 means that insufficient changes will be feasible and that only solution is to defer the introduction of the legislation, ideally until Finance Bill 2015, while this further work is carried out.
defaultI set out our co
defaultncerns in more detail below.
defaultLegislationdefault6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe
default 
defaultdraft legislation is 
defaultvery broadly drafted and has few defined
default terms.  
defaultFor 
defaultexample
default 
default,a
default key phrase upon which much of the discussion lies is the phrase “substantially wholly”
default in s863B(1)(b)
default.  This is not defined in
default the legislation but is stated unequivocally in the guidance to mean 80%.  
default In addition, 
defaultduring discussions, HMRC have clarified that a factor which will determine whether condition A applies or not (
defaults863B(
default1)-(3)) is whether an individual is paid in priori
defaultty to his fellow members.  This is not mentioned in the legislation but could be included relatively easily
default.
default 
default7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe legislation includes a capital test (Condition C).  Broadly a member requires capital in excess of 25% of any disguised remuneration in order to fail the condition and avoid becoming a salaried member.  We believe that the level of capital required in 
defaultthis test discriminates unfairly against non capital-intensive businesses and those firms which manage cash flow efficiently.  There is a risk that including this test will drive firms to adopt uncommercial behaviour
default as it may encourage firms to require me
defaultmbers to inject capital, notwithstanding that this may not be needed by the business.  
default8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe
default capital
default test also only allows 
defaultformal 
defaultcapital to be included in the calculation. We disagree that only fixed capital is relevant. Large amounts of funding for workin
defaultg capital and investment come not from capital subscriptions made by partners, but from the retention of internally generated funds otherwise payable to partners, such that at any point in time the total investment by the partner group significantly exceed
defaults the formal capital which they inject. This deferral of payment is a feature which distinguishes partners from employees (employees would expect to receive the vast majority of their remuneration during the year rather than after the year-end).  For examp
defaultle, the Statement of Financial Position at page 48 of KPMG’s Annual Report for the year ended 30 September 2013 shows that while the formal capital contributed by members was £50m, the total members’ interests were £354m.  
defaultThe balance of £304m represents t
defaulthe net of unallocated or undrawn profits.  We believe that any capital test should allow all of these interests to be classed as capital.
default 
default9
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe legislation is drafted by reference to tax years.  The tax basis period for LLPs is the accounting period.  This 
defaultis also the period for which many LLPs agree member remuneration structures and capital.  We believe that the legislation will be easier to apply for both taxpayers and HMRC if it were redrafted by reference to accounting periods and therefore recommend th
defaultat this is done.
default10
default 
defaultSome firms
default,
default including KPMG
default,
default award retiring partners fixed profit shares or priority payments in their final year of membership or agree the profits of that final year at the time of retirement rather than following the end of the year when
default profits are known. 
default While in some instances it will be the case that no further services will be performed by the member following the agreement (see 
defaults862B(
default1)(a)), this is not always the case as a notice period may be worked.    The current legislation
default wi
defaultll 
defaulttherefore 
defaultgive rise to the anomalous situation that individuals may be genuine equity partners and taxed as such for many years, but that they are taxed as employees in their final year of membership.  We strongly recommend an exemption from the provisi
defaultons for anyone in their final 12 months of membership provided they have not been a salaried member in any of the previous three (say) years.
default11
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe introduction of specific rules taxing individual members on profits allocated to a non individual member of a 
defaultpartnership
default is anticipated to 
defaultcause difficulties for many mixed partnerships because the legislation
default 
defaultis 
defaultintentionally 
defaultaimed at taxing commercial 
defaultarrangements, as well as structures specifically designed for tax avoidance.  Examples of commercial arrangemen
defaultts caught by the new rules include allocations of profits to corporates for working capital purposes, investments, or deferred profit arrangements.
default12
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, the legislation has been drafted with anti-avoidance mainly in mind, as the legislation requires th
defaulte taxpayer to consider whether it would be reasonable to conclude that the reason some or all of the excess profits have been allocated to the corporate is attributable to the relationship between the corporate and the individual member.  Then, only a just
default and reasonable 
defaultallocation of the excess profits is taxable on the individual member.
default13
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis style of drafting is appropriate for tax avoidance legislation, where a degree of flexibility is required.  However, where the legislation has a purpose of raising additional tax from commercial arrangements it is not appropriate to have such subjecti
defaultve tests.  Such subjective concepts give rise to a high level of uncertainty as to how the legislation applies to a commercial situation.  
defaultWe believe that these should be removed as they do not make good legislation.
default14
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn summary we believe that, while the a
defaultpproach taken is drafting the legislation has the potential to achi
defaulte
defaultve clarity and restrict application to the stated policy group, it does not do so as currently drafted.
defaultGuidancedefault&#xa0;
default15
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe guidance supporting the draft legislation is 56 
defaultpages
default long.  While we
default welcome the principle of HMRC issuing guidance (and acknowledge that we would have raised concerns about lack of clarity if none had been issued) we do not believe that the guidance as currently drafted performs its correct 
defaultpurpose
default.  This should be to cla
defaultrify the legislation rather than to extend it.
default  As the guidance is not regulated by Parliament there is a risk of interpretation by HMRC which is not in accordance with Parliament’s wish.
default16
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDespite its length the guidance itself does not clarify certain key 
defaultpoints.  We have submitted several additional examples and questions to HMRC in an attempt to obtain certainty on our own position and that of many of our clients.  We attach as 
defaultan 
defaultappendi
defaultx
default 
defaulta 
defaultcop
defaulty
default of
default some
default additional examples 
defaultwe have 
defaultsubmitted 
defaultto HMRC to da
defaultte.
default  We do not believe that the
default 
defaultguidance take
defaults
default account of the wide variety of different commercial arrangements many firms have agreed within their partner group.
default  In addition, the guidance does not cover any of the practical issues which will arise for LLPs in applying the new legislation such as the amounts upon which PAYE and NIC must be paid or the interaction with for example the overlap rules for members who 
defaultare now treated as salaried members.
default17
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe believe that, once changes and improvements have been made to the legislation, the guidance should be rewritten to reflect the revised legislation, taking account of a far wider range of commercial arrangements.
defaultTimidefaultndefaultgdefault18
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn the consultation in the summer
default of 2013
default HMRC initially proposed that there should be a series of tests based on the case
default law definition of an employee b
defaultut
default,
default following representations, the test published on 10 December solely looks at three factors
default, pro
defaultfit sharing, management and capital.
default 
defaultW
defaulte are pleased that 
defaultsome 
defaultrepresentations have been listened to
default and agree that the three factors selected do represent the most appropriate elements of existing case
default law
default. However, 
defaultt
defaulthe introduction of these new tests
default with
defaultout an extension of the timetable for 
defaultintroduction 
default allows
default insufficient time for further consultation to be carried out, necessary amendments to be made to improve the application of the legislation and for taxpayers to understand and act on the implicatio
defaultns.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe new rules
default were published on 10 December 2013 and
default are due to be effective from 6 April 2014
default although the legislation will not become law until Royal Assent in July 2014.  
defaultWe understand that following the current consultation process which ends on 4 
defaultFebruary, revised legislation or guidance
default will be issued by mid-February.  We do not consider that this will provide HMRC with long enough to consider the various representations being made. If revisions are delayed until 
defaultthe time of the budget on 19 March
default there will be 
defaultless than three
default weeks before
default the legislation will become effective
default.
default 
default19
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis timing is unsatisfactory for two reasons.  The first is that it is retrospective
default both because i
defaultt applies from a date before it is fully enacted
default but also because it app
defaultlies to arrangements already in place before it will be enacted (or, in some cases, published)
default.  The second is that HMRC are unable to provide clearances for firms until after Royal Assent 
default(although HMRC 
defaulthave agreed to provide informal guidance) 
defaultmeaning th
defaultat firms will be required to operate the legislation with uncertainty. We believe that this places an unnecessary administrative burden on all LLPs, which would be substantially reduced if the legislation we
defaultre
default deferred
default.  
defaultWhile we understand the need for anti-avoidance legislation to be enacted quickly to prevent avoidance, this legislation goes far further than an anti-avoidance provision would normally go and affects many businesses who are not engaged in avoidance.  
defaultWe 
defaultt
defaultherefore 
defaultbelieve that any deferral should be to Finance Bill 2015 as this would allow su
defaultff
defaulticient time for further consultation, redrafting and clarification
default.
default              defaultConclusiondefault 
default20
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn summary therefore we believe that
default:
default■
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultsignificant further work needs to be done to re
defaultfine the legislative approach and draft focussed legislation which meets the policy objective (but does not go wider);
default■
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultthe 
defaultnon-statutory guidance
default should be redrafted to ensure that it simply clarifies rather than extends the legislation; and
default■
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaulttime
default must be m
defaultade to do this by postponing the introduction of any legislation until these improvements are made.

defaultKPMG additional examples tranche 1 – defaultCondition Adefault              default              default              default              default       default AppendixdefaultExample 1a: basic exampledefaultA, B and C are members of ABC LLP.  A is allocated 2 points and B and C are each allocated 4 points.  Regardless of the level of profit A will receive 20%, while B and C will receive 40% each.  
defaultAll three members receive no disguised 
defaultremuneration,
default they each have a variable interest in the overall profits of the partnership.
defaultExample 1b: ‘benchmark’ and variable amountsdefaultA, B and C award themselves ’salaries’ of £20,000, £40,000 and £40,000 respectiv
defaultely and agree that the total profit will be shared in proportion to those salaries.
default If the overall profits of the partnership are more or less than £100,000 then each partner will share in the deficit or surplus in proportion to their agreed salary.  
defaultThis
default arrangement is in substance identical to example 1a: each partner has an interest in the profits of the partnership which is variable by reference to the overall profits of the partnership.  It is not relevant that the partnership has chosen to describe t
defaulthis arrangement by reference to a salary.
defaultExample 1c: guaranteed amountsdefaultContinuing example 1b, individual D joins the LLP.  He is also awarded a ‘salary’.  His total profit share will be calculated as a proportion of the total profits of ABC LLP in the sa
defaultme way as A, B and C but in his first year he is guaranteed a total profit share of no less than £30,000.  If his allocated share of the profits is less than this it will be borne by the other members; D will receive his profit share in priority to A, B an
defaultd C.
defaultD’s guaranteed profit share of £30,000 is disguised salary as it is fixed.  Accordingly, unless it is reasonable to expect that ultimately D’s share for the period will exceed £37,500, such that his overall return is not substantially wholly fixed, he
default will meet Condition A.
defaultExample 1d: capped variable interestsdefaultE joins the LLP described in 1b above. 
defaultLike D, s
defaulthe is awarded a 
default‘
defaultsalary
default’
default. Her total profit share will be calculated as a proportion of the total profits of ABC LLP in the same way as A, B and C 
defaultbut her total profit share cannot exceed £25,000.  
defaultAs E is sharing directly in the overall profits of the partnership up to a certain point and her profit share is not paid in priority to the other members she will not meet Condition A unless, in practice
default, the overall profits of the partnership are expected to be such that she will 
defaultrealistically 
defaultalways receive £25,000
default.  If this were so, it would imply that her total received was not in practice a variable share of total profit equal to her ‘salary’ as a fr
defaultaction of all salaries, but was simply a fixed sum meeting Condition A.
defaultExample 1e: businesses with stable or reliable profitsdefaultSame as example 1b above, but the profit forecast is reliable or the nature of the business is such that profits are not signific
defaultantly variable from year to year such that it is unlikely that profits will be materially greater or less than £100,000.
defaultThe fact that the overall profits of the business may be accurately forecasted and/or are stable from year to year does not mean that C
defaultondition A is necessarily met: each of the partners has an interest in the partnership which will vary with the overall profits of the partnership, even if those overall profits are predictable or are not significantly variable.
defaultExample 1defaultfdefault: timing differendefaultces between cash and profitdefaultFacts as 
default1b above
default.
default However
default, 
defaultthe ‘salaries’ are distributed in-year.  It is agreed that to the extent there are insufficient 
defaultprofits,
default excess
default drawings will only be 
defaultsatisfied 
defaultout of future profits of the firm
default (meaning the drawings 
defaultin the following years would be less than the affected members’ profit allocations)
default. 
defaultThe distribution to members of drawings representing advances against allocations 
defaultof  profit
default share does not of itself change the position from that in 1b.
defaultExample 2: discdefaultretionary awardsdefaultPlease see attached marked-up versions of Examples 1A and 14 from HMRC’s 10 December Guidance.
defaultExample default3a: sharing in divisional profits onlydefaultAB LLP has four members 
defaultA
default, B, C and D.  A and B work in division X and C and D work in division 
defaultY.  Division X generates profits of £10
default,000
default and Y of £90
default,000
default.  
defaultThe LLP deed provides that
default A and B will share the profits of division X and that C and D will share the profits of division Y.  
defaultAll four members meet condition A as none of them receive a shar
defaulte of the overall profits of the firm.
defaultExample default3defaultbdefault: whole firm profits shared on discretionary basis between members of divisions (i)defaultThe facts are the same as example 
default3
defaulta except that 
defaultthe LLP deed provides that profit allocation is at the discretion of the 
defaultmembers.  T
defaulthe four members 
defaultmeet and, as per their terms of reference, they consider a range of factors including the financial performance of each division, the need for the divisions to work together and support each other, and the overall strategic direc
defaulttion of the firm. They 
defaultagree
default 
defaultthat A and B will share profits of £
default15,000
default, leaving C and D to share £
default85,000
default.
defaultAssuming the members have properly exercised their discretion under terms of reference based on more than just divisional profit sharing, they will n
defaultot meet condition A as their profit shares are each partly dependent on the overall profits of the whole firm.
defaultExample 3c: whole firm profits shared on discretionary basis between members of divisions (ii)defaultThe 
defaultfacts are the same as example 3b
default except that
default t
defaulthe 
defaultfour members agree
default 
defaultthat A and B will share profits of £
default1
default0
default,000 while 
defaultC and D 
defaultwill
default share £
default9
default0
default,000
default.
defaultThe four members will not meet condition A as their profit shares are still partly dependent on the overall profits of the entire firm,
default 
defaultnotwithstanding that 
defaultthe resulting shares are the same as if profits were shared on a purely divisional basis.
defaultExample default3d: part divisional, part pro-rata splitdefaultThe facts the same as above example 3a except that the four members agree in advance that half of each division’s pro
defaultfits will be split between the partners in that division, and half will be pooled and split equally between all the partners. Using the example above, A and B are therefore allocated £17.50. C and D are allocated £32.50.
defaultWe see two possible interpretations
default of the legislation, either:
defaultThe four members will now not meet condition A as their profit shares are partly dependent on the overall profits of the entire firm.
defaultOr:
defaultThe firm’s total profit should be treated as two amounts.  The first, 
defaultdivision
defaultally alloca
defaultted amount then meets Condition A while the second, 
defaultequally split 
defaultamount does not.  The relative proportions of the two amounts for a member will determine whether that member meets Condition A.
defaultExample default4defaultadefault: bonus pool for high performersdefaultA is a member of 
defaultXY LLP. A receives a fixed share of £90,000
default the terms of which result in it being considered to be disguised salary
default. XY sets aside a proportion of profits each year as a 
defaultbonus pool to reward high performing members.  Whilst the 
defaultoverall 
defaultpool will vary with 
defaultprofits, the 
defaultshare of that pool 
defaultallocat
defaulted
default to 
defaultan 
defaultindividual member will depend on their individual personal performance.  All members are eligible to receive a share of this profit pool and A typically receives a bonus ranging from £25,000 to £35,000 each y
defaultear. 
defaultA will 
defaultnot meet
default condition A as less than 80% of her expected profit share is fixed.  
defaultExample default4defaultbdefault: infrequent bonusesdefaultThe same conditions as in 3a but 
defaultA
default only occasionally receives a bonus allocation.
defaultA will meet condition A as her expected profit shar
defaulte is just her fixed share.
