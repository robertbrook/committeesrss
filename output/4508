defaultIntroductiondefaultThis submission has been prepared by a group of researchers from the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC). It draws on a number of current and recent UKERC research projects including research on 
defaultc
defaultarbon 
defaultc
defaultapture and 
defaults
defaulttorage (CCS), the assessment of electricity
default generation costs, scenarios for smart electricity grids, and energy efficiency and demand reduction. It also builds on the wider expertise of the authors in low carbon innovation, including the role of policies and incentives to support such innovation.

default).
defaultBefore turning to the Committee’s specific questions, it is usefu
defaultl to set out some important features of low carbon innovation that have informed our responses. 
defaultThe definition of innovation
default we use in this submission is
default a broad one
default. Innovation includes several distinctive but related stages – from research and developme
defaultnt (R&amp;D) to prototyping, demonstration, commercialisation and deployment. 
defaultE
defaultarly conceptions of innovation characterised 
defaulta linear
default process of moving through these stages from R&amp;D to deployment
default. 
defaultHowever, t
defaulthis 
default‘linear model’ was soon abandoned as too simplisti
defaultc by many of those engaged in innovation as well as some of those trying to understand and support it.
defaultMore complex conceptions of innovation were developed for several reasons
default, each of which is important for current and future UK policies to bear in mind
default. First, there are frequent feedback loops between the stages of innovation. Innovation does not only happen through the development of new technologies, it also occurs as a result of ‘learning by doing’ as technologies are deployed in 
defaultmarkets. 
defaultOnshore win
defaultd and solar PV provide clear examples where innovation and learning through deployment has delivered substantial cost reductions. However, recent work by UKERC also suggests that cost reduction through innovation and learning is an inherently uncertain pro
defaultcess that may not be characterised by smooth downward trajectories, and that exogenous factors such as currency 
defaultmovements and raw material price rises can overwhelm such cost reductions
default.
defaultSecond, innovation involves multiple interactions between public and
default private
default sector actors in 
default‘innovation 
defaultsystems’
default. These systems have traditionally been understood at a national or regional level, but there is an increasing emphasis in innovation research on systems that focus on particular groups of technologies (e.g. lo
defaultw carbon technologies). Furthermore, these systems are 
defaultincreasingly global which poses particular challenges for 
defaultnational 
defaultinnovation policies.
default Third, innovation is not only a technological process – it is also associated with institut
defaultional and social chang
defaultes
default. 
defaultFor example, smarter electricity networks could open up opportunities for electricity markets to operate in different ways, and for a different relationship between consumers and energy suppliers. 
defaultFourth, innovation can be incremental (e.g. to steadily
default improve the thermal efficiency of a gas turbine or solar panel) or radical (e.g.
default 
defaultto fundamentally change the relationship between electricity supply and demand through the application of information, communication and control technologies).
default&#xa0;
defaultResponses to defaultthe Committee’s questionsdefaultThe 
defaultUK’s 
defaultlow carbon transition 
defaultwill
default 
defaultrequire 
defaultchange
defaults
default in 
defaultour energy system
default at a speed
default that is unprecedented in our lifetimes. 
defaultAnalysis by
default 
defaultthe government, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) and 
defaultUKERC
default 
defaultshows
default that 
defaultthese changes will require concerted action across the energy system to develop and deploy low carbon and energy efficient 
defaulttechnologies
default.
default A recent review of low carbon scenarios generated by 
defaultone of 
defaultUKERC’s energy systems model
defaults
default reinforces the importance of energy efficiency across the economy if medium and long-term targets for emissions reduction are to be met in a cost effec
defaulttive way. It also shows that early decarbonisation of the electricity sector – and some subsequent electrification of 
defaultother sectors (heat and transport) is common across th
defaulte
defaults
defaulte
default scenarios. 
defaultThis transition will also require broad societal acceptance of the l
defaultarge-
defaultscale 
defaultlow carbon generation 
defaulttechnologies that may be needed to achieve these goals (e.g. 
defaultwind, CCS, nuclear).  In some cases (e.g. home refurbishment, travel mode and community energy projects) more active engagement 
defaultby citizens with the energy system
default, and in the changes that are required, is implied.
default These social and behavioural changes form par
defaultt of the innovation
default that is necessary
default. 
defaultUKERC funded research on public attitudes to energy system change
default indicates that it is possible for the public to make sensible judgements about energy system innovation when they understand the dilemmas and challenges
default involved
default.  
defaultAgainst this background, our view is that the government’s overall approach to low carbon 
defaultinnovation 
defaulthas moved in a positive direction over the last 10 years
default. As the
default N
defaultational Audit Office (NAO) report commissioned for this inquiry shows
default, the UK government has significantly increased funding for energy research, development and demonstration (R
default,D&amp;D) since the early 2000s. The vast majority of this funding has been directed to low carbon technologies (see Figure 1).
defaultFigure 1: defaultUK Public Spending on Energy R
default,
defaultD&amp;D (1974 to 2012) 
defaultSource: IEA 
defaultEnergy Technology Research and Development Database
default.
defaultIt 
defaultis also welcome that government funding is not only focused on fundamental research, but is also concerned with the development, demonstration and early deployment (see our response to question 4 below). Furthermore, the NAO highlights positive improvement
defaults since 2010 in the co-ordination of publicly funded R,D&amp;D and in the development of an improved evidence base through Technology Innovation Needs Assessments (TINAs).
defaultHowever, the NAO report also draws attention to some shortcomings of the government’s ap
defaultproach. There is now a substantial international 
defaultevidence
default 
defaultbase on
default ‘what works’ in
default energy innovation
default policy
default. 
defaultInsights from this evidence base include: 
defaultthe need to establish
default a coherent, system-level perspective, providing sustained funding over time, avoidi
defaultng ‘capture’ by incumbent private sector interests, and supporting a combination of incremental and 
defaultpotentially radical
default 
defaultinnovations.
defaultJudged against 
defaultthis evidence base
default, 
defaultthe UK approach could still improve. As shown by Figure 1, government funding for R,D&amp;
defaultD has been erratic. 
defaultThere has been a dramatic decline since the 2010 high point – with a one-third reduction in total public spend between 2010-11 and 2011-12 alone. This was due to a ‘spike’ in funding in 2010 due to the stimulus package the UK government
default implemented following the 2008 financial crisis. 
default Furthermore, there have been calls for the level of funding to be increased further to reflect the extent of the UK’s low carbon ambitions
default.
defaultThere has also been a lack of systematic evaluation of past R,D&amp;
defaultD programmes, and the inclusion of explicit learning within the design or new or revised programmes. In some cases, such learning has been undertaken.
default For example, both DECC and the NAO have reflected on some of the problems encountered in attempts to fund
default full-scale CCS demonstrations
default. Whist progress with the 
defaultdemonstration of CCS technologies has been slow and frustrating – and this is in part due to the poor design of innovation policies
default - lessons learned have then been incorporated into the design of the current phase of the CCS commercialisation programme.
defaultThe 
defaultNAO 
defaultalso 
defaultnotes
default that 
defaultco-ordination across public sector bodies and agencies with respect to low carbon innovation may not be effe
defaultctive enough. 
defaultIn our vi
defaultew, the Low Carbon Innovation Co-ordination Group
default (LCICG)
default has been successful to some extent in improving co-ordination and taking a ‘high level’ strategic view of priorities for low carbon innovation. However, 
defaultco-ordination could be
default more effective at the level of individual initiatives or technology areas. For example, a number of initiatives are seeking to support smarter electricity and heat networks including the Energy Technologies Institute smart systems and heat programme, the 
defaultLow Carbon Networks Fund (overseen by energy regulator, Ofgem) and a proposed new 
defaultE
defaultnergy 
defaultS
defaultystems Catapult
default (funded by the government’s Technology Strategy Board)
default. There is significant scope for a greater level of information sharing, 
defaultand 
defaultjoint learning acro
defaultss these initiatives.
default 
default&#xa0;defaultHistorically, many commentators argue that there has been a bias towards the support of low carbon 
defaultinnovation on the supply side of the energy system,
default both in the UK and more widely
default.
default This is reflected in a greater level of government support for innovation in energy supply technologies, despite well documented and well understood barriers to the develo
defaultpment and widespread up
defaulttake of demand side innovations
default. It is therefore welcome that energy demand technologies have recently received a greater share of UK government R,D&amp;D funding than in the past (see Figure 1).
defaultGiven the barriers to deployment of ener
defaultgy efficiency technologies, and their potential to deliver emissions and cost reductions relatively quickly, it is 
defaultreasonable to place a major focus on the deployment phase of the innovation process for demand side options. Historically, that is what the U
defaultK and ot
defaulther Governments have done
default. However, the current policy approach to deployment needs to be strengthened. Our analysis indicates that the current policy mix is unlikely to deliver sufficient cost-effective energy efficiency. Contracts for difference 
defaultwill provide a clear signal for investment in low carbon supply; but there is no equivalent support for el
defaultectricity efficiency deployment
default. Support for household electricity efficiency under CERT has not been continued in the Energy Company Obligation (ECO
default).  Support for business sector energy efficiency, outside the Climate Change Agreement (CCA) sectors, is effectively restricted to energy taxes (CCL and CRC), which will have a limited impact given the price inelast
defaulticity of electricity demand
default. The propose
defaultd £20M Energy Demand Reduction pilot provided for in the Energy Bill is welcome, but itself very small and its operation through the capacity market is 
defaulta priori
default unlikely to be effective for energy efficiency technologies given their high capital cost and n
defaultegative operational costs. 
defaultIt would be a mistake to focus 
defaultonly 
defaulton 
defaultthe 
defaultdeployment of demand side technologie
defaults
default, or to assume that 
defaultthe rate of 
defaulttechnical
default change on the demand side
default of the energy system
default is slower
default than on the supply side.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe opposite 
defaultcan
default be true
default: mass-
defaultmarket technologies change more rapidly than those dependent on large scale construction projects.  For example, lighting technology 
defaultcould
default go through two complete transitions (
defaultfrom 
defaultincandescent to fluorescent
default; and then from fluorescent
default to 
defaultLE
defaultDs
default) in 
defaultthe
default time
default-
defaultscales 
defaultit will have 
defaulttake
defaultn
default to deliver a single power plant fitted with CCS.
default 
defaultOf course, there are difficulties supporting innovation in energy efficiency: it cuts across three major sectors – buildings, process industry and transport – with a
default huge diversity of actors a
defaultnd technologies.  However, well-
defaultdesigned Government funded R&amp;D programmes 
defaultto 
defaultsupp
defaultort energy 
defaultefficiency technologies
default have been found to be highly cost effective in both the UK
default and the USA
default.  
defaultAlthough network technologies are not necessarily low carbon per se, they can been important enablers of low carbon energy systems. 
defaultNetwork innovation
defaults
default 
defaultfor heat, gas and electricity 
defaultha
defaultve
default 
defaultalso 
defaultreceived more government support 
defaultin recent years
default because of this
default enabling role. R,D&amp;D activities have been funded by g
defaultovernment, the Research 
defaultCouncils, electricity distribution companies (via initiatives such as the Low Carbon Network Fund
default, LCNF
default) and the Energy Technologies Institute
default (ETI)
default.
defaultThe LCNF program 
defaultis

defaulting
default netw
defaultork innovation by enabling tria
defaultling of new technologies, operating and commercial arrangements. A recent review of smart grid projects across Europe reveals 
defaultthat the UK is now one of the largest investors in smart grid
default demonstration
default proje
defaultcts
default. However, 
defaultin per capita terms
default,
default 
defaultUK investment is well behind some other countries 
defaultsuch as Denmark.
defaultE
defaultffective mechanisms 
defaulthave not yet been 
defaultput in place to share learning
default 
defaultbetween different funded programmes, 
defaultand 
defaultto 
defaultimprove the effectiveness of the innova
defaulttion system in this area
default. Recently the 
defaultEnergy Networks Association
default 
defaultlaunched a ‘smarter networks 
defaultportal’, an inventory of projects 
defaultoverseen by Ofgem
default. This does not include projects funded by other public funding bodies. 
defaultS
defaultuccessful 
defaultdeployment of network 
defaultinnovation
defaults
default will depend on the systematic 
defaultapplication of the 
defaultlearning from these individual 
defaultR,D&amp;D 
defaultprojects 
defaultby network companies and other actors (e.g. Local Authorities) 
defaultto their mainstream activities. In addition to good mechanisms for learning, this will
default also require sufficient skills and
default access to capital. 
defaultThe 
defaultunder supply 
defaultof skills 
defaultin science, engineering and technology occupations
default 
defaultin the UK
default could negatively impact 
defaultthe pace and scope of 
defaultnetwork 
defaultinnovation in the coming decades. 
defaultSimilarly, there will ne
defaulted to be strong, long-term incentives for investors and network operators via regulatory formulae and other policies for if such wider deployment is to take place.
default&#xa0;defaultThere are two main rationales for the role the LCICG plays. First, there is a need to 
defaultimprove the co-ordination of low carbon innovation funding across different
default public funding bodies
default. This should help
default to promote learning, 
defaultto strengthen 
defaultnetwork
defaults between firms and other innovating organisations, 
defaultand 
defaultto identify areas where there are synergies or overlaps. Second, strategic thinking is required to identify priority 
defaulttechnology areas for these funding bodies.
defaultWhilst the establishment of the LCICG has improved co-ordination
default significantly
default, there is still 
defaultscope for this to improve. 
defaultBoth the NAO report commissioned for this inquiry and the recent report from the Research C
defaultouncils’ Energy Strategy 
defaultFellow
defaultship make this point
default. The Fellowship 
defaultreport 
defaultalso 
defaultargues that there is 
defaultscope for more co-ordination 
defaultbetween funding agencies at a ‘working level’, for example 
defaultthrough specific joint initiatives
default such as funding calls
default. 
default 
defaultThe 
defaultLCICG also
default has a key role to play in identifying priority technologies and funding mechanisms for the UK’s publicly funded energy R,D&amp;D programmes. Given that the UK is a medium sized economy, and public finances are tight, it is not possible for public fu
defaultnding to support all low carbon technologies at a significant level. Despite this rationale for prioritising a number of specific technology areas for support, the UK government has not 
defaultprovided explicit rationales for the choices that have been made. A pa
defaultrtial exception was the report produced by a group convened by former Chief Scientific Advisor, Sir David King, in 2002
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultT
defaulthe 
defaultTINAs that have been produced so far
default, together with an assessment carried out by the Research Councils’ Energy Strategy 
defaultFellowship
default, represent a welcome step forward. 
defaultThese assessments focus on important criteria such as the relevance of specific technologies for UK policy goals, the potential value of successful development and deployment for the UK, and the current status
default of UK scientific and industrial capabilities
default. 
defaultOf course, the TINAs have some limitations. 
defaultT
defaulthe government has not yet 
defaultpublished an overall strategy that draws on these individual TINAs
default – and provides a rationale for technological priorities
default. Such an overv
defaultiew is due to be published in early 2014. 
defaultIn addition, innovation may also entail changes in 
defaultthe 
defaultbehavior of energy users
default, business models and institutions. These non-technical 
defaultdimensions of innovation
default 
defaultneed to be factored into innovation polic
defaulties
default more strongly.
defaultThe measurement of the relative success of the LCICG’s strategy – and of the government’s overall support for low carbon innovation – will not be straightforward. As the NAO notes, the LCICG has proposed seven metrics for outputs and outcom
defaultes. 
defaultIt remains to be seen how easy it will be to gather the necessary data – and to attribute such outputs and outcomes to R,D&amp;D programmes. Given that innovation often occurs over relatively long timescales, there are likely to be significant time lags be
defaulttween spending within these programmes and the full impacts of this spending on deployment. Furthermore, such metrics will only be useful if they are part of a wider effort to monitor and evaluate the impacts of R,D&amp;D programmes – and to apply the lessons 
defaultto future programmes.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is important for government to strike a balance between support for nearer-to-market low ca
defaultrbon technologies that can be deployed over the next 1-2 decades and support for more basic R&amp;D for the long term. Technologies in the former category are much more likely to have an immediate impact in helping to meet energy policy goals, particularly the
default UK’s carbon budgets to the late 2020s. 
defaultS
defaultome commentators have called for a refocusing of efforts on more fundamental R&amp;D
default on the grounds that ‘breakthroughs’ may make meeting these targets cheaper
default. Whilst such R&amp;D is important, 
defaultour view is
default 
defaultthat 
defaultthis is 
defaultvery 
defaultunlikely to be sufficient
default. A
default significant amount of innovation (and cost reductions) occurs through 
defaultlearning-by-deployment
default. 
defaultFor th
defaultis
default reason, there needs to be a continuing
default policy support for
default the deployment of a range of low carbon innovations including energy efficiency and demand 
defaultreduction (see answer to question 2 above) and low carbon supply.
default Furthermore, this policy support needs to be tailored to take account of the large differences bet
defaultween low carbon 
defaulttechnologies 
defaultin terms of their development stage, 
defaultmarkets, level of complexity and so on
default. 
defaultTaking offsho
defaultre wind as an example
default, it is important to focus on 
defaultoperations and maintenance regimes to enhance reliability and improve load factors, a
defaultnd reductions in 
defaultcapital costs
default through increases in turbine size
default.
default 
defaultI
defaultt is 
defaulttherefore 
defaultwelcome that the government’s approach emphasis
defaultes
default stages of the innovation process that are nearer to market – 
defaultincluding
default 
defaultthe demonstration and scaling up of low carbon 
defaulttechnologies.
default 
defaultDemonstration is a particularly risky stage of the innovation process because it requires an increasing amount of investment to be made by a technology developer, but at a time when the risks of failure remain high. Government policy has an i
defaultmportant role to play in supporting technologies across this ‘valley of death’ between R&amp;D and commercial deployment.
defaultThe UK’s CCS commercialisation programme and the Low Carbon Networks Fund
default (LCNF)
default are two good examples of 
defaultgovernment funding for this stage of the innovation process. It is not clear in either case whether government funding will help deliver 
defaultall of 
defaultthe desired outcomes. 
defaultBut they show that government and other public sector bodies (Ofgem in the case of the LCN
defaultF) have become more comfortable with 
defaultdemonstration 
defaultfunding. As we have noted in our answer to question 1, 
defaultmechanisms for 
defaultlearning 
defaultwithin
default these programmes will be essential
default. These will help to ensure effective knowledge sharing 
defaultby the companies and other or
defaultganisations involved, and 
defaultlesson learning by
default funding 
defaultbodies seeking to maximise the ch
defaultances 
defaultof successful outcomes
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs we have noted in our answer to question 4, innovation processes take time. 
defaultTherefore funding programmes that support these processes need to have 
defaulta certain amount of predictability and durability. 
defaultThe UK’s recent experience of funding for energy R,D&amp;D h
defaultas been a distinctive and rather extreme one
default, as
default shown by
default Figure 1
default. 
defaultAs the Energy Strategy Fellowship report argues, more sustained funding is required, with longer-term programmes in some cases
default.
defaultIf the recent
default decline continues, and there is
default no improvemen
defaultt in certainty, there is likely to be a commensurate decline in investment in innovation by the private sector. 
defaultThe recent changes to the Energy Comp
defaultany Obligation (ECO) illustrate
default this. 
defaultThese changes 
defaulthave already had a substantial effect on delivery plans
default for solid wall investment.  This results from the scaling back from the original ECO plans, which our analysis at the time indicated was very ambitious (arguably over-ambitious)
default.  However, the change is a serious setback for longer term building fabric e
defaultfficiency goals in the UK, given the importance of the solid walled building stock, as it substantially weakens the policy drivers for improvement of this technology. O
defaultne change in ECO from earlier supplier obligations is removal of support for improvement
defaults in efficie
defaultncy in lighting and appliances.
default Again, this results in limited pressure for commerci
defaultal investment in innovation.
default  
defaultAnother contrasting area where short time horizons are potentially an issue is the CCS commercialization programme. As noted earl
defaultier, progress with the demonstration of CCS technologies in the UK has been frustratingly slow. Whilst it is very welcome that £1bn is still available in principle to 
defaultpartly 
defaultsupport one or more demonstrations, repeated delays mean that there is a risk that
default this funding will not be available when required – especially if implementation 
defaultis delayed beyond the current 
defaultSpending Review period. 
default&#xa0;defaultGiven that many low carbon technologies are developed by multinational firms, international collaboration can complement national government R,D&amp;D 
defaultprogrammes – and help to reduce the costs of achieving domestic policy goals. The 
defaultIEA 
defaultnoted that for 
defaultthe UK, ‘international collaboration… may be essential to accelerate technology development’
default. The European Union is the UK’s most important international arena for public energy innovation. As in the UK there have been recent
default efforts to improve the cohere
defaultnce of European research.
default Spending in the Framework Programme (and the successor ‘Horizon 2020’ programme) is embedded in the European Commission’s Strategic Energy 
defaultTechnology Plan, which elaborates a long-term vision of energy system development. This inc
defaultludes Industrial Initiatives and a European Energy Research Alliance (EERA), comprising 15 leading energy research institutes (UKERC is the lead partner in EERA for the UK). The International Energy Agency has also built up a significant range of publicly 
defaultfunded activities in energy innovation in recent years, including a set of Implementing Agreements (IAs) for collaboration in specific areas. 
defaultEvidence on the effectiveness of UK engagement in international initiatives is mixed. The UK participates in 25 o
defaultf the IEA’s Implementing Agreements
default. This is 
defaultwell above the average
default. Within the 
default7
defaultth
default European Framework Programme
default (FP7)
default, UK universities and research organisations have out-performed the European average in attracting support
default. However, 
defaultthe reverse is true 
defaultfor private companies
default. 
defaultThe UK’s performance in attracting this funding for 
defaultlow carbon research within 
defaultFP7 has also been mixed. According to a Committee on Climate Change report in 2010, UK funding share was
default just 11%
default at the time
default, far behind Germ
defaultany which at
defaulttracted 21%
default. T
defaulthe UK 
defaultwas
default also perceived 
defaultat the time as being
default less effective as other states at influencing the design of the Framework Programme for
default low-carbon technologies
default. 
defaultAs more consolidated international programmes have emerged, the UK’s system of 
defaultdistributed centres and networks has created some barriers to participation. UK participation in international programmes has been mostly on a bottom-up basis
default,
default 
defaultled by individual institutions with little overall co-ordination (see our response to Q3). 
defaultThe 
defaultEnergy Research Partnership identified a need for stronger linkages between the UK’s domestic energy innovation strategy and international engagement
default. The international review of the Research Councils’ Energy Programme also detected missed opportunities f
defaultor international collaboration, due to lack of guidelines or incentives (particularly for collaboration outside of the European Union), lack of funding and low awareness or time availability on the part of researchers
default.
