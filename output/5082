defaultWritten evidence submitted by  defaultShaare Zedek default&#xa0;
defaultSummarydefaultShaare Zedek Medical Centre is a microcosm of 
defaultthe society that 
defaultleaders strive to create in the region; a community of people from all religions, ethnicities and backgrounds who live and work together side by side regardless of their circumstances. 
default[1]
defaultThrough employment opportunities, 
defaultinstitutional collaboration, 
defaultmedi
defaultcal treatment and research, Shaare Zedek delivers a 
defaultmodel of coexistence in action, often at great financial expense to the hospital. [2]
defaultVario
defaultus research initiatives exist
default specifically
default to
default advance the medical treatment of Palestinians and Arab patients. Me
defaultdical departments including the Paediatric Dialysis Unit treat mo
defaultre Arab patients than 
defaultf
defaultrom
default any other ethnic background. [3]
defaultEven d
defaulturing times of political tension and violence
default,
default the hospital continues to 
defaultadhere to 
defaultits principles of patient care without pre
defaultjudice. [4]

defaultLiterally meaning 
default“Gates of Righteousness,” Shaare Zedek has responded to the needs of Jerusalem’s uniquely diverse population from its very first day of operation 
defaultin 1902
default;
default treating patients of every race, religio
defaultn and nationality
default regardless of financial circumstances. 
defaultMedi
defaultcal excellence, patient dignity and a compassionate individualised approach to all
default are core to our
default mission
default. 
defaultAdditionally, t
defaulthe 
default1,000 bed 
defaulthospital maintains its reputation as an internationally-regarded research and teaching hospital, committed to advancing 
defaultscientific progress, innovation and technology.
default [5]
defaultShaare Zedek, with its century-long tradition of offering quality medical care to all in Jerusalem, has been a highly positive force in the city’
defaults development
default and has contributed greatly to residents’ qua
defaultlity of life.
default&#xa0;
default Today, it is considered to be in the top echelon of med
defaultical institutions in Israel, despite receiving 
defaultno government funding
default 
defaultfor equipment, development or research. 
default[6]
defaultCoexistence as a way of lifedefaultVisiting dignitaries
default,
default including British Parliamentarians
default,
default often ask about 
defaultefforts taken to advance
default coexistence at the hospital. Coexistence is a way of life 
defaultat Shaare Zedek. 
defaultPatient ethnicity is not recorded upon admission but the hospital 
defaultestimates that 
defaultthe ethnic makeup of 
defaultits patient population is very similar to th
defaultat
default of Jerusalem as a whole; 
defaultapproximately 70
default% Jewish, 30% Arab. Our patients are referred from all over Israel and surrounding areas including 
defaultt
defaulthe 
defaultPalesti
defaultnian Territories
default and other countries including the United 
defaultArab 
defaultEmirates
default.
default [7]
defaultOur staff also 
defaultclosely mirrors
default Jerusalem’s ethnic and religious composition.
default&#xa0;
default We have several senior staff members from the Arab and Palestinian communities, including our chief cardiothoracic surgeon, a senior anesthetist, a senior uro
defaultlogist, and a senior cardiologist.
default [8]
defaultCertain departments of the hospital have a patient mix which varies significantly from the average for a variety of reasons.
default&#xa0;
default For instance, approximately two-thirds of the patients in our 
defaultPaediatric
default Dialysis Unit are Arabs, because of a genetic predisposition in that population to kidney disease.
default 
defaultI
defaultn order to better meet the edu
defaultcational and social needs of the
defaultse
default yo
defaultung patients and their families, the 
defaultPaediatric
default Dialysis Unit
default has an Arab social worker 
defaultand an Arab teacher on staff. 
default [9]
defaultInterestingly, while in the “outside world,” there is minimal contact between ultra-Orthodox Jews and Arabs, in the 
defaultP
defaulta
defaultediatric
default Dialysis Unit, 
defaultpatients and families 
defaultfrom both cultures 
defaultmix freely.
default&#xa0;
default Families with children su
defaultffering from kidney disease find that they have much more in common than that which divides them.
default This sense of community was witnessed by 
defaultCouncillor
default Vikki Slade on a recent visit to the hospital:
default [9]
default“These children have to come into the hospital on a 
defaultdaily or alternate daily basis, something which has an incredible impact on the family lives of those involved. I was heartened to watch parents sit with children from the opposite side of the political divide while their own parents went to pick up other 
defaultsiblings from school or leave the bedside for other reasons.”
default [10]
defaultShaare Zedek’s approach is not to ignore religious and ethnic differences; it is rather to show respect for them.
default&#xa0;
default This approach is demonstrated in a number of areas.
default&#xa0;
default A perfect example t
defaultakes place in the M
defaultuslim
default month of Ramadan, when religiously observant Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset.
default&#xa0;
default Shaare
default Zedek provides a special 
defaultmeal for its Muslim staff members, scheduled to begin precisely at sunset.
default 
default[11]
default&#xa0;
defaultArabdefault patientsdefaultThe policy 
defaultof 
default“political blindness” comes at a great cost to the hospital.
default&#xa0;
default While Israeli citizens are entitled by law to health coverage through one of the country’s health funds, non-citizens like those who com
defaulte from the Palestinian Authority
default have no such coverage and
default often these cases are completely uninsured.
default [12]
defaultWhile severe limitations have been placed on the number of patients coming into Israel from the P
defaultalestinian 
defaultA
defaultuthority
default, there are still a significant number of Palestinians being treated in Israeli hospitals
default, including Shaare Zedek.
default&#xa0;
default The cost to the hospital to treat these largely uninsured patients is well in excess of $100,000 per year.
default [13]
defaultDespite this
default, it is our pledge as a modern medical 
defaultcent
defaultre
default driven 
defaultby compassion and not politics 
defaultto ensure that when a
default patient arrives at our doors in need of help, he or she will not be deprived.
default 
default[14]
defaultA story which illustrates th
defaultis approach is t
defaulthat of a three year 
defaultold girl rushed to Shaare Zedek from Nablus with severe kidney failure. The close relationship between the h
defaultead of the hospital in Nablus and the head of 
defaultPaediatric
default Nephrology at Shaare Zedek meant one phone call ensured a crash team were waiting for her on arrival. She died on the operating table but the medical team managed to stabilize her and brought her bac
defaultk to life after which she made 
defaulta remarkable
default recovery in the care of the 
defaultPaediatric
default Dialysis Unit. 
defaultThis life saving collaboration was only possible 
defaultbecause of the 
defaultclose relationship between the 
defaulttwo 
defaultdoctors. Shaare Zedek 
defaultwas
default 
defaultfully 
defaultaware that there was no aut
defaulthorization from the Palestinian Authority to treat her
default and even if such authorization had been given it would not have covered most of the cost of the treatment. 
defaultShaare Ze
defaultdek covered the full cost of the girl’s
default treatment. 
defaultSuch stories are a regular occurre
defaultnce at Shaare Zedek
default and are part of the hospital’s contribution to peace
defaultful coexistence
default.  
default[15]
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultCoexistence at times of political conflictdefaultShaare Zedek is not immune to the effects of terrorism. The direct impact on the number of patients and the 
defaultincreased demand for emergency and trauma medicine is immense. During such periods staff-
defaultoften 
defaultincluding those whose family members have been victims of attacks- continue their work on the 
defaultunderstanding that those who enter our doors 
defaultare patients first and
default foremost
default and the duty of doctors and nurses is to heal.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultFollowing a shooting during the Second Intifada one young patient recounted how a team of Arab and Jewish doctors had brought her back to life:
default [16]
default“
defaultA bullet ripped through my chest and into my lun
defaultg. Two women were killed during that attack and dozens more, beside me, were wounded.
default 
defaultI was taken by ambulance to Shaare Zedek Medical Centre and by the time we made it to the hospital, I had no pulse and no blood pressure. I was considered dead on arrival
default. Through the skilled hands of Dr. Shuli Silberman and Dr. Mahar Deeb, a Jewish and Arab doctor working together, they performed a miracle and brought me back to life. After the surgery, was a long recovery process. My after-care specialist, Dr. Salah Odat
defaultallah, stayed by my side through my stay in the ICU and then in the regular ward. But that was not enough. During my stay we formed a strong bond and when I was given permission to return to Chicago, he insisted he fly back with me to ensure my safe return
default.
default”
default [17]
defaultShaare Zedek also treated a number of Arab victims of terror attacks during the Intifada.
default One victim, 
defaultIbrahim
default,
default explained the importance of a social workers’ support for his brother after they were both brought to Shaare Zedek 
defaultsuffering injuries fr
defaultom a bus bombing
default:
default [18]
default “For him to see just how much the staff cares about him, the way everyone wants to help, has made a big difference to him.”
default [19]
default&#xa0;
defaultResearch default&#xa0;defaultIn the area of research, we have conducted a number of studies in cooperation with 
defaultJordanian and Palestinian physicians and hospitals, including a comparative study of the use of pain medication for cancer patients in various institutions, and a genetics study to identify mutations associated with a high risk of breast cancer.
default&#xa0;
default Cooperati
defaultve research with Palestinian institutions has been curtailed to some extent because the risk of terrorism has impeded travel, but staff members on both sides are doing their best to continue working together.
default [20]
defaultBeing 
defaultbased in the heart of Jerusalem
default,
default Sha
defaultare Zedek is fortunate to have a diverse population of people with a wide ethnic pool
default which provides
default a 
defaultfantastic 
defaultresou
defaultrce for research. Recent studies 
defaultlooking specifically at Jewish and Arab populations 
defaultinclude research into 
defaultchildren
default’
defaults smoking habits 
default and
default diabetes
default.
default [21]
default&#xa0;
defaultA major focus of research int
defaulto inherited diseases
default is identifying the mutations responsible for genetic diseases in children. In Jerusalem, marriage between relatives or within a small ethnic group is still common and
default,
default combined with large 
defaultfamily size, this results in a higher frequency of genetic diseases in children. Some diseases are common, e.g. Tay Sachs, which is now prevented by prior testing, but many of these often devastating diseases are specific to a particular family. Advances i
defaultn genetic technology make it possible to identify the mutation causing the disease. This can help the family prevent further affected children (e.g. by 
defaultpre-implantation genetic diagnosis
default) and also provides important insights into the functions of various g
defaulten
defaultes. We have already identified seven new disease genes in the past three
default years.
default [22]
default&#xa0;
defaultResearch activity in the Medical Genetics Institute includes collaboration with Palestinian colleagues to determine inherited mutations that affect breast cancer risk 
defaultin Arab women
default. The Breast Health Centre is 
defaultalso 
defaultworking on a comparative study examining the characteristics 
defaultand stages of diagnosis 
defaultof Arab 
defaultand Jewish 
defaultbreast cancer patients 
defaultin Jerusalem
default.
default [23]
default&#xa0;defaultShaare Zedek &amp; UK defaultGovernment defaultShaare Zedek’s collaborative 
defaultapproach to medicine was first raised in Parliament by Lord Turnberg during a Parliamentary debate in 2003:
default [24]
default default“I was very encouraged by a meeting that I had with representatives of the Shaare Zedek Hospital in Jerusalem, who described efforts that they
default were making to work with a major hospital in Amman in Jordan and in Ramallah in the Palestinian territories. They were developing plans jointly to provide humanitarian aid of a medical type in a co-ordinated way for the survivors of conflicts in Iraq and 
defaultother places in the Middle East. Will it be possible for the UK to work with those organisations to support them and others which are working in a co-ordinated operation?”
default [25]
defaultThis project did not receive support from UK Government but contact remains be
defaulttween the institutions. 
default[26]
defaultWe would welcome a visit by the 
defaultCommittee to the hospital to gain a greater understanding of Shaare Zedek’s work in medical collaboration across communities.

defaultLetter written for Shaare Zedek UK newsletter from Councillor PPC Vikki Slade following a visit to Shaare Zedek, September 2013
default&#xa0;
defaultAs foreign aid and field hospitals arrive in the Philippines this week I am reminded of my inspirat
defaultional trip to Israel and Palestine last month and the account from two members of the Israeli rescue mission to Haiti after their devastating earthquake.
defaultOur LDFI (Liberal Democrat Friends of Israel) Parliamentary visit was intended to provide an understa
defaultnding of the geo-political situation in Israel and Palestine and we were privileged to meet a range of political and social figures on both sides along with families living in Jerusalem who hosted us for their Shabbat dinners.
defaultOur first encounter at the h
defaultospital was the Paediatric Dialysis Unit where I was struck by the sheer number of children from all ethnic backgrounds who suffer from genetic kidney disorders. We were told that this has become prevalent partly due to limited integration in small communi
defaultties. These children have to come into the hospital on a daily or alternate daily basis, something which has an incredible impact on the family lives of those involved. I was heartened to watch parents sit with children from the opposite side of the politi
defaultcal divide while their own parents went to pick up other siblings from school or leave the bedside for other reasons.
defaultElsewhere in the hospital we toured the Emergency department, funded by generous donations and named for a British family who support a n
defaultumber of medical establishments in Israel. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIts design is unusual in that it forms a series of concentric circles, helping specialists to work across the unit more effectively, and it is built underground to make it resilient to the attacks that were a fea
defaultture of Jerusalem in the past.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs a first time visitor to Jerusalem, the Shaare Zedek Medical Centre provided a real ray of hope among the political turmoil surrounding its historic building. A place of love, welcome to all whatever their race or religio
defaultn. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOf all the places we visited in the country, this was the place I witnessed the world in one place – staff, patients and visitors representing almost every nation of the world. 
default&#xa0;
defaultComing together with love and showing humanity's similarities rather than 
defaultfocusing on our differences.
