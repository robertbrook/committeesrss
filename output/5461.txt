[[[vidence from the Wales Office (DWB 20)]]]&#xa0;Explanatory questions to HM Government&#xa0;Responses from HMG noted under each question.&#xa0;1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Could you please provide a Keeling Schedule for the following amendments to the GOWA 2006: Clauses 2, 6 and 17 in the Bill. &#xa0;Keeling Schedule for GOWA 2006 at Annex A.&#xa0;2. Could you confirm the anticipated yield from each of the devolved taxes for Wales for the financial year 2013-14, and for each of the previous five tax years?  &#xa0;Detail for 2013-14 is not yet available; the following provides an indication of tax yield for SDLT and Landfill tax from 2007/08 to 2012/13:&#xa0;&#xa0;SDLT Wales - HMRC national statistics releases http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/statistics/stamp-duty.htmLfT Wales - HMRC experimental disaggregated figures http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/statistics/receipts.htm 2007-08£210m£38m2008-09£115m£43m2009-10£100m£40m2010-11£115m£48m2011-12£125m£49m2012-13£105m£50m&#xa0;&#xa0;3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Can the Government confirm that it intends to apply the ‘indexed deduction’ method to adjusting the block grant for the introduction of devolved income?  What information can it supply about the impact of applying that reduction to the Welsh block grant?  If an element of income tax is devolved following a referendum, the Government intends to apply the ‘indexed deduction’ mechanism to adjust the Welsh Government block grant as recommended by the Silk Commission (and which is also being implemented in Scotland).  In the first year of operating this mechanism (as well as in any preceding transitional years) an amount equivalent to the revenues generated by the Welsh rate of income tax (at 10p) will be deducted from the block grant.  If the Welsh Government sets a rate of 10p then its budget will be unchanged during these years (as the deduction will be the same as the revenues generated by the Welsh rate of income tax). Setting a Welsh rate of 11p or 9p will lead to a higher or lower budget respectively (as the deduction will still be based on the 10p forfeited by the UK Government).  In year 2 onwards, the deduction from the previous year will be indexed against growth in the UK non savings non dividend (NSND) income tax base,  i.e. if the UK NSND income tax base grows by, for example, 1% or -5%, then so will the deduction. The Welsh Government budget will therefore benefit from these new arrangements when the NSND income tax base grows more quickly in Wales than the UK average (and conversely the budget will be lower if growth is slower).  By linking the Welsh Government budget to the performance of the Welsh economy, this increases accountability and provides a further incentive to create growth.  But at the same time this mechanism shields the Welsh Government budget from UK-wide effects that the UK Government is better placed to manage (as the Welsh Government budget is only affected by the relative performance of the Welsh and UK NSND income tax base).4. What approaches will be used to calculate reductions from the block grant for stamp duty land tax and landfill tax?  The UK and Scottish Governments are currently discussing the most appropriate block grant adjustment mechanism in relation to stamp duty land tax and landfill tax.  The Scotland Bill Command Paper indicated that this would be a one-off adjustment but the precise nature of that adjustment is still to be agreed.  The UK Government has now opened similar discussions with the Welsh Government, with the intention that the same mechanism can be agreed for both Wales and Scotland.&#xa0;The definition of a Scottish taxpayer inserted by the Scotland Act 2012 sets out that, if an individual has a main place of residence for the same amount of time, or spends the same number of days, in Scotland as in another part of the UK; they will be a Scottish taxpayer. &#xa0;This means that the definition of a Welsh taxpayer cannot be identically drafted to the parallel provision in Scotland, as this would mean a taxpayer could be both a Welsh and Scottish taxpayer in the same year if, for example, their main place of residence was in each country for an equal amount of time.  &#xa0;Options to resolve this issue are currently being considered and will be included in the final Bill. &#xa0;6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Could you clarify paragraph 66 in the explanatory notes on reliefs. It seems there are discussions yet to be had between the Government and stakeholders on the devolution of reliefs. How will this process work? What powers will the Welsh Government have over reliefs under the proposals? &#xa0;HMRC consulted representatives from private sector representative groups on the impact of the Scottish rate of income tax on aspects of the UK income tax system including income tax reliefs.  The consultation contributed to the approach to the treatment of reliefs for Scottish taxpayers in HMRC’s Technical Note, published in May 2012. &#xa0;Before making any orders under this section, to amend the application of the Welsh rate of income tax to tax reliefs, the UK Government would consult relevant stakeholders. Our starting point would be the results of the previous consultation, so we would expect that the approach taken in these areas, including the treatment of tax relief for charitable donations and pension contributions would follow the proposals in the Technical Note, subject to any changes in the tax system or in the capability of IT systems in the interim. &#xa0;The devolution of income tax reliefs is not within scope of this Bill. The Welsh Government’s power relates only to the rate of income tax – we would expect the Welsh Government to be involved in consultation in relation to reliefs, but the final decision would rest with the UK Government because of the potential for wider impacts on the income tax system as a whole.&#xa0;7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The draft Bill does not contain provision for devolving business rates to Wales.  Indeed, the term ‘business rates’ does not feature in the draft Bill. However, in the explanatory notes attached to the draft Bill it says “The draft Bill also implements the [Silk] Commission’s recommendation to fully devolve business rates in Wales. The Welsh Government budget would then be directly affected by revenues from business rates in Wales, reflecting the performance of the Welsh economy, rather than being determined by spending funded by business rates in England through the Barnett formula.” (p68).  Do the proposed changes to business rates require statutory change, and if so where is this to be found the draft Bill? Which clauses do this? Could you please give a detailed explanation. The summary impact assessment refers in error to the inclusion of business rates in the draft Bill. We apologise unreservedly for this error. Legislative competence over business rates is already devolved to the National Assembly for Wales by virtue of the “local government finance” subject in heading 12 (local government) of Schedule 7 to the GoWA 2006. No further devolution of legislative competence is needed to effect the Government’s commitment to “work with the Welsh Government to fully devolve non-domestic (business) rates”, and so no provision is made in the draft Bill in relation to business rates.Changes are needed to the way in which business rates affect the Welsh Government’s budget in order to implement full devolution. At present, changes to the Welsh Government’s budget in relation to business rates are  determined through the Barnett formula, following changes in spending funded by business rates in England, and so revenues generated by Welsh business rates have no direct effect on the Welsh Government’s budget. Discussions are underway between HM Treasury and the Welsh Government so that changes in business rates revenues in Wales directly affect the funds available to the Welsh Government (as is already the case in Scotland and Northern Ireland). This will link growth in the Welsh Government’s budget more closely to the performance of the Welsh economy. The aim of both Governments is to implement these changes as soon as possible.8.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Could you clarify whether clause 11 means that the Secretary of State has the power to prevent a referendum on income tax devolution even if there has been a vote in favour in both the National Assembly for Wales and the Houses of Parliament?Under clause 11 of the draft Bill, the Secretary of State may refuse to lay a draft order following a “trigger” vote passed by two thirds of the Assembly, and must give notice and reasons for that refusal to the First Minister within 180 days of receiving notification from the Assembly. This process is based on the same procedure which led to the referendum in March 2011 which led to full law-making powers for the National Assembly for Wales. Once the Order has been approved by both Houses of Parliament and the Assembly, in practice the Secretary of State has no power to prevent the Order being made by Her Majesty.9.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Welsh Government’s borrowing capacity will be increased if there is a ‘yes’ vote in a referendum on income tax devolution. In that event, what mechanism is there to decide how much the borrowing capacity should be increased by? &#xa0;The Government has set out a principle linking capital borrowing powers to the level of Devolved Administrations’ independent revenue.  This would suggest that the Welsh Government’s capital borrowing limit would be increased if an element of income tax were to be devolved.  The precise increase would be a matter for a future government, but the limit could be increased to slightly more than £1bn using the borrowing/revenue ratios applied in Scotland.  The draft Wales Bill includes the power for the capital borrowing limit to be amended but not to a level below the initial £500m.  &#xa0;&#xa0;22 January 2013&#xa0;
