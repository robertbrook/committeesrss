[[[Written evidence submitted by Channel 4 [WAS0028]]]]&#xa0;Channel 4 welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee’s inquiry into women’s sport.We note, in particular, that the Committee has decided to focus in part on the media coverage of women’s sports. As a UK public service broadcaster that televises a select number of sporting events, Channel 4 is committed to providing coverage of women in sport, and our response below is confined specifically to this aspect of the inquiry, rather than the broader topic of women’s sport.Channel 4’s coverage of sports has, over the years, tended to focus on one or two major sporting commitments, for example cricket from 1999 to 2005 and, latterly, through our coverage of disability sport and horseracing. In 2013, Channel 4 took over live coverage of all the major horseracing meetings in the UK.These events are both notable for involving sports in which women compete on an equal footing, either alongside men’s events (such as women’s athletics) or as competitors with men (for example, the Paralympic sport Boccia and in horseracing where there are an increasing number of female jockeys). As such, while Channel 4 does not provide as extensive levels of sports coverage as other broadcasters, our coverage of a select number of sports makes a significant contribution to the coverage of female competitors as well as men.The following submission sets out Channel 4’s approach to coverage in this area, looking at our current range of sports programming and our plans for broadcasting these sports in the future, which we hope the Committee will find useful as part of their wider inquiry into women’s sport.

[[[Channel 4 News]]]In recent years, Channel 4 News has also sought to pioneer coverage of women’s sports, covering a wide range of sports and gender issues, as well as analysis of the growth of interest within a number of women’s sports, both on-screen and online. Such reports include:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[arch]]]Channel 4 recently undertook to educate itself more about the state of play of women’s sport in the UK, commissioning a private external research project on this issue for internal information purposes.While recognising that there are reasons to be optimistic about women’s sport – such as the impressive peak audiences for women’s events at the Olympics and Paralympics and the increasing levels of sponsorship of female athletes at London 2012 – this research found that there are a number of wider developmental challenges that need to be tackled.For example, while broadcast coverage may be a necessary condition for popularising women’s sport, it found that is not an exclusive one: many other factors are required to work as part of a virtuous cycle, as outlined in the graphic below:
