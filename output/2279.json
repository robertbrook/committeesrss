"EIS 16\nWritten evidence submitted by the Crown Estate&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Crown Estate welcomes the opportunity to \nrespond to this \ninquiry\n on the \nextractive industries sector\n. \nThe statements contained in this \nresponse\n are\n grounded\n in The Crown Estate’s \ninterests, land ownership and as largest minerals landlord of the UK\n. \nThe Crown Estate is a \ncommercially-run, \ntotal return\n,\n active asset management business\n,\n \noversee\ning\n \na UK-wide\n portfolio of\n prime urban, rural\n, coastal\n and \noffshore \nproperty. In line with our core values, we actively manage these to deliver a c\nommercial return, which is paid each year to the Treasury for the benefit of the nation. We \nare committed to \ncareful \nstewa\nrdship of the assets we have been trusted to manage.\n \nThe Crown Estate is g\nov\nerned by an Act of Parliament, T\nhe Crown Estate Act 1961\n. I\nt has a public remit whilst at the same time being independent from Government – a statutory corporation\n,\n run on a comme\nrcial basis.\n \nWe are committed to working with government departments, stakeholders and industry in helping to manage the coastal and marine environment\n, in line with our commercial remit\n.\nOur rural and marine assets \ncomprise\n:\n \nAs with Mines Royal, we are not involved in the physical process of mining, but we license \nsuch activity. In recent years we have invested in new operations with the purchase of mineral interests at Cauldon Low in Staffordshire and Nether Murthat in Scotland.\n Our responsibility for Mines Royal determines the need for o\nur permission to remove Cro\nwn gold in any form. We currently have four Mines Royal production leases, including one active gold mine in Northern Ireland.\nWith these interests combined, this makes The Crown Estate the largest minerals landlord in the UK. \nIt is important to be clear t\nhat The Crown Estate has no rights over UK hydrocarbons, such as Shale Gas, which accrue to ‘the Crown’ but are vested in the Department for Energy and Climate Change. In this context we are no different to any other landowner. \nHaving reviewed the \nquestio\nns posed in the \ninquiry\n, \nwe have addressed \nonly \nsome \nof the \nspecific \nquestions \nwith\n relevance to our role\n. We believe other organisations such as the Minerals Producers Association\n (MPA)\n and CBI Minerals Group are best placed to comment in other areas.\n&#xa0;\nQuestion 1:  What is the contribution to the UK economy of extractive industries in the UK?It is important at the outset to recognise the \nrole\n and impact\n that terrestrial planning policy has on \nmarine minerals\n. This is particularly true in areas where \nland \nbased\n minerals are under local \nplanning pressures\n which restricts supply\n,\n allowing m\narine minerals\n a greater market share.\n \nIt is therefore very important to e\nnsu\nre\n \nthat terrestrial \nplanning policy specifically references consideration of marine \nminerals as\n way of\n maximising the potential of this indigenous resource.\nW\nhilst minerals guidance is set out under the National Planning Policy Framework, with local aggregates assessments undertaken by Local Authorities, consideration of other sources, such as marin\ne minerals (which are outside of \nthe \nspatial demarcation\n of a Local Authority)\n is needed as part of broader supply chain considerations. \nC\nlear policy guidance \nensuring \nthat \nmarine minerals\n contribution continues\n,\n \nin the context of UK supply of minerals, \nth\nis \nwill\n maximise \nthe overall\n benefit\n to the UK economy\n.\nA robust regulatory regime exists\n for marine aggregates\n, which is managed through the Marin\ne\n Management Organisation\n \n(MMO) \n(England)\n and\n Natural Resources Wales (Wales)\n.\n \n There is currently no extraction in Scottish or Northern Irish waters.\n Operating businesses in this sector have a significant capital asset base to maintain, requiring security of mineral reserves\n, and it is \nimportant that the \nMarine Licence \napplication p\nrocedure\n recognises the long term nature \nand scale \nof the associated investment profile\n without \nintroducing an excessive burden on the \nindustry\n. \n \nThe Crown Estate has introduced a procedure designed to optimise the use of the seabed whilst working within \nthe guidelines introduced by the marine planning process that is currently being developed by the MMO. This procedure is also designed to provide a safeguarding protocol for key resources.\nThe \nMPA\n recently commissioned \na study\n to assess the contribution the mineral products sector (pr\nincipally minerals extracted to\n supply the \nconstruction sector) makes to \nthe UK economy\n and would be able to provide conclusions outlining the Gross Value Added (GVA) contribution the sector makes \nto the UK economy.\nAlongside the economic contribution minerals production makes to the UK, it is also important to recognise the need for \na \nsecure supply\n of minerals for the construction industry\n.\n Millions of tons of marine sand and gravel are used across the construction industry and for coastal management and land reclamation each year. \nThe Crown Estate licens\nes nearly all marine seabed sand and gravel resourc\nes lying offshore around the UK\n;\n and\n has \nbeen licensing the activity \nfor \nover 50 years\n. \nExtraction of about 20 million tonnes p\ner \na\nnnum\n of marine aggregates \noccurs \noff the\n coast of England and Wales.\nAs set out in the Marine Policy Statement\n for the UK, m\narine mineral from UK seabed is v\niew\ned as a world class resource.\n It is an important source for security of supply and there is always the potential opportunity to export our dredged materials to other countries in Europe\n.\nAs we adapt to cl\nimate change, large volumes of \nmarine sand and grave\nls are used in beach replenishment schemes. Aggregates are pumped directly from dredgers onto beaches,\n providing coastal protection, \ne\nnhancing the amenity value and \nproviding security to the local economy, for example on the coast of Lincolnshire.\nIn addit\nion, marine sands are used in land reclamation schemes, infilli\nng areas in ports and harbours \nto reclaim land from the sea. Recent examples of reclamation include the runway extension at Ronaldsway airport on The Isle of Man and the London Gateway port dev\nelopment\n. \nIt is important to note here that sourcing of marine based minerals ensure that the schemes undertaken are \neconomically viable \nand it is likely that without these vital resource\ns\n,\n this would not be the case. \nMarine sourced mineral is unique in te\nrms of the ability to import and place large quantities of mineral in a short space of time without the need for importation by road.\n \nThe Crown Estate is \nalso \nresponsible for leasing extraction of minerals lying below the UK sea bed, including deposits of\n potash.\n \nPotash is a generic term for a variety of potassium bearing minerals; in part\nicular it is Sylvinite that is\n currently\n \nmined in the UK. Around 90 per cent of UK potash is used in the production of fertiliser with the remainder being used in the che\nmical \nand pharmaceutical industries. \nApproximately 60 per cent of all UK production is exported each year.\n \nThe Boulby potash mine, situated on the North Yorkshire coast, is the UK's only commercial potash mine and the most important non-hydrocarbon minera\nl operation in Britain. The mine, which started production in 1973 and is currently managed by Cleveland Potash Ltd, employs \naround\n \n1100 workers (another 200 workers \nhave been recruited \nthis year, some of \nwhich\n have come from closed coal mi\nnes). Mining ope\nrations extend \naro\nund 8 km offshore and \nthe mine\n is the s\necond deepest in Europe (approx\nimately\n 1km below sea level).\nBoulby mine\n produces in the order of 3 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) potash ore and refines this into 1mtpa potash mainly used in the fe\nr\ntiliser industry. Although the c\nompany produces enough potash to satisfy the UK demand, \nthey supply about half of the UK\n market with the remainder being imported from \noverseas\n.  \nThe\n rock salt\n also mined\n \n(in order to access the potash ore) is mostly sold t\no Local A\nuthorities and\n the Highway A\nuthorities\n (with \nproduc\ntion in the order of\n about 0.8 mtpa\n)\n as de-icing salt\n for roads\n. \nThe Company contributes £225M per year of economic activity as measured by product sales.  They support many local small suppliers\n and service companies.  Half their sales are overseas with approximate foreign earnings of £100M per year.\nDuring 2011, York Potash \nsigned an agreement with us for the rights to explore f\nor polyhalite under the seabed \nto the south of Boulby and exploratio\nn is underway. \nYork Potash has determined \nthe existence of considerable reserves\n both under the land and under the seabed, and is in the process of carrying out resear\nc\nh to support an \napplication to\n \nNorth York Moors National Park \nfor land based mining oper\nations and associated surface workings\n.\n \n \nA decision is expected in 2014\n. \nThe MMO has already \ngranted\n \npermission for the offshore element.\nQuestion 2:  How do the UK-based extractive industries support employment a) in the UK and b) for UK citizens overseas?Whilst The Crown Estate has previously commissioned and published work related to the analysis of socio economic indicators of marine related activ\nities in the UK economy (ISBN978-1-906410-01-8), \nthe MPA have information available regarding the role the extractive industries more broadly play in supporting employment\n, as highlighted in our response to question 1\n. \nWe estimate that t\nhere are approximat\nely 3,000 people \ndirectly \nemployed in the extraction\n and processing\n of marine minerals (\nmarine \naggregates and potash)\n, with many more jobs involved indirectly through downstream and upstream activities.\n&#xa0;\nQuestion 6:  Is there sufficient engagement between UK extractive industries and the NGO sector? Are there examples of best practice in engagement between the extractive industries and NGOs?The Crown Estate has sought to \nfurther develop \nour relationship\ns\n with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) with resp\nect to the activities that we lease and license. We feel that as our role has become more proactive in the development of our portfolios of activities and management of \nthe \nestate, so too has the improvement in the relationship with relevant NGOs.\nThe Crow\nn Estate funds and supports the Seabed Users and Developers Group (SUDG). The SUDG is an informal grouping of industry sectors whose participants have a common interest in sustainable development within the UK’s marine environment. The Crown Estate works w\nith SUDG to align seabed user groups across the UK to work positively with Government to prepare shared understanding and approaches to marine management. Organisations involved include sectors whose members require marine licenses for construction and ope\nration include British Ports Association, United Kingdom Major Ports Association, British Marine Aggregates Producers Association\n (the minerals trade association)\n, British Marine Federation, Oil &amp; Gas UK, Renewable Energy Association, Renewable UK, Subsea \nCables UK and Carbon Capture and Storage Association. \nIn October 2012, SUDG published a joint statement\n with \nthe Marine Conservation Society, RSPB, The Wildlife Trusts and WWF to work collaboratively on marine conservation in relation to seabed uses. \nThe\n SUDG positively engages with environmental NGOs through this forum.\nThe Crown Estate also works very closely with BMAPA to develop best practice and enhance knowledge and understanding of the sector. \nWe have commissioned studies in a number of areas, whic\nh have been published and placed in the public domain. \nAn example of these joint initiatives is “The Area Involved” reports. These are published annually as a result of a March 1999 statement of intent between The Crown Estate and BMAPA committing to revi\newing all dredging licences over a rolling five year period. Included was a commitment to surrender areas no longer containing useful resources of sand and gravel and to publish an annual report detailing the extent of dredging within the licensed areas. T\nhis year’s report which is to be published shortly is the 15th in the on-going series, and has drawn widespread acknowledgement for the level of information and transparency provided.\nAnother example of work undertaken to \nhighlight the sustainable credenti\nals of the marine aggregates sector\n is our involvement in\n developing an industry protocol for the reporting of marine archaeology, and we provide annual analysis of the area of seabed affected by marine mineral extraction. Much of this information is available through our web site (\nhttp://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/energy-infrastructure/research/\n).\nIn many of these areas the \nmarine aggregates \nsector is acknowledged as being a leader amongst the extractive industries and as a consequence\n recognises a significantly improved relationship with many NGOs.\n&#xa0;\nQuestion 10: What is the competitive landscape for the extractive industries in the 21st Century and is it in the UK’s interest to remain a global centre for them?The competitive landsca\npe for the UK building materials industry has altered over the last decade following the acquisition of UK companies by global organisations for whom cement production is a core activity (e.g. – purchase of Hanson by Heidelberg Cement, RMC by Cemex, \nand Ag\ngregate\n Industries by Holcim).\n&#xa0;\nThis industry wide consolidation has led to greater integration of UK and European suppliers and competition for available capital investment. \n&#xa0;\nThe low value\n of some minerals (e.g. aggregates) means that local markets remain a feature for \nmost \nsuppliers that do not have the ability to take advantage of rail or sea logistics. Marine minerals are in a position to take advantage of cro\nss\n border trade, with around\n \na third\n \nof marine aggregates and\n half \nof potash supplies being exported.\nWe trust that you will find these comments \nhelpful and \nconstructive. \nWe would be very willing to provide additional information on any of the points we have raised above\n and be very pleased to discuss these matters with you further\n. \nThrough the \nEnergy &amp; Infrastructure’s \nMinerals &amp; Infrastructure\n team\n, w\ne are ready to engage in further discussions on these and other points relevant to our ownership or which our expertise m\nay be brought to bear.\n All of this response may be put into the public domain and there is no part of it that should be treated as confidential.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nThe Crown Estate has no rights over UK hydrocarbons, such as Shale Gas, which accrue to ‘the Crown’ but are vested in the\n \nDepartment for Energy and Climate Change. In this context we are no different to any other landowner. \n&#xa0;\n Capital Economics economic study: \nhttp://www.mineralproducts.org/feature_ce_report.\nhtml\n Marine Policy Statement: \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-marine-policy-statement\n \n The joint statement can be found on the SUDG website: \nhttp://www.sudg.org.uk/downloads.php\n \n"
