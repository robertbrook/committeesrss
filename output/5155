defaultIn particular, the trade in illicit tobacco has a strong adverse impact on our members, and it is regarding this trade that we are primarily responding to this inquiry. We are less qualified to comment on the smuggling of tobacco, although clearly inasmuch as smuggled tobacco fuels the trade of illicit tobacco, it does have a

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOur members’ primary concern is that they are frequently targeted by criminal gangs seeking to steal large quantities of legitimate tobacco products, often by violent means. Legitimate product stolen from wholesalers then forms a key constituent of the trade in illicit tobacco on the black market. It is blended with smuggled and illicit products, and sold on by organised gangs. As a consequence, the black market trade in tobacco directly undercuts our members’ businesses and that of their customers, legitimate retailers.

default6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe wholesale distribution sector is particularly vulnerable to theft due to the large amount of tobacco stock held at cash and carry or distribution centres and depots. Since January 2012 there have been at least 350 crimes against wholesalers and retail customers, leaving their e
defaultmployees 
defaultunder consta
defaultnt threat of physical violence. A retailer in Croydon, for example, required plastic surgery following an attack.  In another recent case, a retailer was killed during a tobacco robbery at a cash and carry.
default&#xa0;
default7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGiven the nature of tobacco products – high value and low in weight – they are the most sought after product by criminals. 
default&#xa0;
default8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe average value of these crimes is £2,000, but many are significantly higher. In fact, the total value of goods stolen in the 350 thefts and robberies since 2012 is equivalent to 4.2 million cigarettes being stolen by criminal gangs for sale on the black market, with a street value of more than £1 million. 
default&#xa0;
default9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThese legitimate products are 
defaultoften blended on the black market with tax paid tobacco and
default non-tax paid tobacco from other countries, as well as counterfeit cigarettes and illicit whites, which are cigarettes manufactured for the purpose of smuggling.

default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe negative 
defaultimplications 
defaultof tobacco theft 
defaultfor 
defaultthe 
defaultwholesale 
defaultdistribution sector are severe. For example, in 2010 one Scottish cash and carry chain was the victim of 14 burglaries which resulted in a total of £3.2 million in lost sales, repairs, guarding costs and other associated costs. 
default&#xa0;
default11.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFurthermore, there is a real threat of cash and carry retailers 
defaultceasing to trade due to the threat of violence, which results in lower sales. For example, a retailer in Sidcup was attacked on his way home from a cash and carry, and £2,000 in tobacco was stolen. A second attack occurred after he was followed home from the cash and carry, threatened outside his shop and forced to hand over £4,500 in tobacco.
default&#xa0;
default12.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMany FWD members have highlighted that the constant need to divert considerable 
defaultfinancial
default and human
default resources to dealing with the threat of 
defaulttobacco related 
defaultcrime is unwelcome. Indeed, the need to divert finances in this manner means that our members are unable to invest resource in order to grow their business and 
defaultto employ new members of staff. This is particularly difficult at a time when the country is desperate to find economic growth.
default&#xa0;defaultPublic Health default&#xa0;default13.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe flood of illicit tobacco onto the black market has implications both for underage access and public health more widely. 
defaultThe
default distribution 
defaultof these products 
defaultoutside the responsible supply chain of 
defaultlegitimate 
defaultwholesalers and retailers severely un
defaultdermines the Government’s aim of

defaultcontrolling access
default through pricing, display regulations and age restrictions.
default 
default&#xa0;
default14.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMoreover, 
defaultillegally sold tobacco products are often of poor quality due to criminals blending the products with other illicit tobacco.
default&#xa0;defaultRecommendations default15.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGiven the growing problem of crime in the wholesale sector, the FWD continues to call for the following immediate policy responses:
default&#xa0;
default16.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPolice forces should mobilise more resources and draw up appropriate strategies to tackle business crimedefault.default In this vein, the FWD believes that the advent of 
defaulte
defaultlected Police Commissioners presents an opportunity to ensure that
default area policing
default strategies to tackle business crime 
defaultinclude measures to address crime against wholesalers. These should be 
defaultproperly developed alongside meaningful local business engagement and consultation. 
defaultMore attention should also be paid to the role that serious organised crime plays in fuelling criminal activity against wholesale, particularly in cases of theft of tobacco products.
default&#xa0;
default17.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA joined up approach among defaultneighbouring police forces, by sharing information and interacting more effectivelydefault. Often in cases of vehicle theft in which the criminal target is in transit crossing different police force boundaries there is confusion as to which force is ultimately responsible.
default 
defaultFurthermore, without effective cooperation it is difficult for different police forces to recognise patterns when crimes are committed in different policing authorities.

default is the second largest group in the grocery delivery market beating all of the major supermarket chains except for Tesco.
