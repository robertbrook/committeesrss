defaultQUESTION
defaultS
default 
default1 and 3: Accountability to the people that use NHS services 
default1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFoundation trusts (FTs) 
defaulthave a unique governance model which builds on the tradition of 
defaultmutuals
default and ensures the trust board is accountable to local communities
default through members and governors
default.  FTs also 
defaultbenefit from greater financial fr
defaulteedoms than NHS trusts, enabling them to respond more effectively to local needs
default.  There are now 
default146 
defaultFTs nationally, delivering acute, mental health, community and ambulance services
default to their local communities
default.  
default&#xa0;
default2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe FT model of local governance helps empower the public and build in local accountability for significant sums of public expenditure.  Foundation trusts are embedded within the communities they serve, particularly as
default 
defaultmembers (comprising local individuals, staff, patients and carers) elect the majority of governors.  FT memberships and representative governor bodies also help foster public participation in the delivery of public services and promote social solidarity.  Engaging 
defaultwith patients and service users, and acting on their feedback, concerns and complaints, is central to robust governance and how the quality of care is viewed. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQUESTION 2: Delivering better outcomes 
default3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn May 2013, the FTN and Barclays published the findings of 
defaulta 
defaultjoint project to examine the economic and social value that foundation trusts and NHS trusts add to their local communities.
default  
defaultAll trusts clearly provide essential services to society by treating illness and protecting and improving the health 
defaultof their populations but they are also often a major employer in their locality and add 
defaultsocial value for communities in ways above and beyond their core role. 
default&#xa0;
default4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSocial value seeks to capture the
default 
defaultbroader impact of an activity on populations, communities and organisations. As major employers, trusts contribute directly to the economy locally and nationally, as well as supporting the long-term well-being of each of their employees as consumers, with families and lives outside of work, and indirectly, as citizens more generally.
default&#xa0;
default5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCommunities greatly value the wider social, economic
default and environmental benefits generated by healthcare providers
default.  
defaultIn addition to the local governance and public participation fostered by FTs
default (described above)
default, the social value of FTs and trusts 
defaultis
default illustrated 
defaultas follows

defaultA
defaultcross England, foundation trust activities contribute £30 billion annually to the economy. Their direct contribution– through employment, partnerships and procurement
default,
default for example – is 
defaulthigher than that of universities, the pharmaceutical industry, or the aircraft and spacecraft industries.  In turn, they indirectly provide additional employment opportunities and economic benefits to their communities.

defaultQUESTION 6: Working together to deliver public services 
default7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe NHS increasingly has to provide care for people with long-term conditions and complex co-morbidities across different settings.  
defaultResponding to these challenges and to patient expectations requires 
defaulta system-wide shift towards integrated health and social care models which deliver better, more co-ordinated care for patients.  
defaultMoves to integration may involve organisational, governance, budgetary or structural changes, but above all they need to improve patient pathways and experiences.  The desired result is effectively captured in 
defaultthe 
defaultdefinition given by the 
defaultIntegrated Care and Support Collaborative: 
default“My care is planned with people who work together to understand me and my carer(s), put me in control, co-ordinate and deliver services to achieve my best outcomes”.
default   
default&#xa0;
default8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRecent examples of integrated care and pathways which our members have led include: using ‘managed clinical networks’ to provide care and treatment for mental health patients who need a range of co-ordinated services; an NHS provider organisation / third sector partnership to create an integrated, early intervention service for dementia to provide a co-ordinated service to assess, diagnose and support people identified with early signs of dementia; a paramedic pathfinder tool which assists ambulance crews in deciding the most appropriate care service for patients; and deployment of 
defaultjoint emergency teams to
default defaultprovide a multidisciplinary response within 24 hours to emergencies arising within the community.
default&#xa0;
default9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultJon Rouse, DG Social Care at the Department of Health, has stated that international best practice suggests successful, patient-focussed, integrated health and care systems share 11 common 
defaultfeatures
default:
default&#xa0;
default10.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis list makes clear that successful health and social care integration depends on close working and alignment at all levels between and within providers, commissioners, Whitehall departments and statutory bodies.  It is a hugely complex task which faces strategic, financial and local operational challenges, but it is one which must be achieved if we are to retain quality care which is nationally affordable and meets 21
defaultst
default century needs.
default&#xa0;
default11.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Government is currently implementing the Integration Transformation Fund to support more co-ordinated services between the acute sector and social care.  While FTN supports the principles driving the fund, we have considerable concerns about the transfer of funding from the NHS frontline in the next two years before new models have had chance to become embedded. There needs to be much greater recognition that achieving the integrated models we need requires time, investment and commitment, with the right incentives, resources, risk management and leadership in place. 
defaultThe NHS can't degrade or cut services or reduce frontline staff, 
defaultin the context of
default demand rising by 5% a year.  
defaultTo maintain 
defaultexisting NHS service delivery, the activities funded by investment in integration have to offset the risks caused by the transfer of funding
default.
default  
defaultNew models should be transparently developed and explained and best practice shared to assist with capability building and organisational adjustments.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQUESTION 8: Choice and control of public services by citizens
default12.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe FTN supports the use of 
defaultpatient 
defaultchoice
default and improvements to patient information
default as drivers of quality and service improvement, alongside other possible drivers
default. Many of our members are directly involved in supporting patients to manage their own conditions and to take decisions about the choices of treatment, and of provider, available to them.
default&#xa0;
default13.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAt a policymaking level, government 
defaultneeds to be careful about how it balances the potentially competing agendas of competition and choice 
defaultwith
default ensuring that NHS providers are financially and clinically sustainable
default for the longer term
default.  The process of evaluating the impact of significant 
defaulttransactions (be they reconfigurations, mergers or other collaborations) 
defaultshould be streamlined and fit for purpose for the NHS.  
default&#xa0;
default14.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCompetition and choice can be successfully applied to drive up quality within the NHS, but with the important caveat that there is a need for a more refined set of industry specific guidance for the health sector
default if it is to be workable.  
defaultIndustry specific guidance must centre 
defaulton a 
defaultfuller definition of ‘patient interest’ which
default takes account of the 
defaultlongterm
default financial and clinical sustainability of the trust, and
default, where proven, should override concerns about signif
defaulticant lessening of competition and choice.
default 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQUESTION 9: Response to service delivery failure 
default15.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe NHS is currently developing a regime to respond to situations 
defaultwhen quality falls below required standards.  Recent announcements on the single failure
default regime for quality and finance, 
defaultspecial measures, 
defaultand 
defaulttrust special administration arrangements have begun to clarify 
defaulthow 
defaultthe system
default will operate
default.  However, further work is needed to ensure alignment and fitness for purpose. 
default 
defaultThere needs to be a rigorous, independent, credible and carefully calibrated way of identifying quality failure and a system of consequences to follow. 
default&#xa0;
default16.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGiven the clear links between financial and quality failure, 
defaultit is paramount that we
default address the growing number of trusts that will 
default– in the absence of appropriate support – 
defaultbecome unsustainable 
defaultas financial pressures increase.  
defaultNHS providers are experiencing a toxic cocktail of pressures: rising demand for unplanned admissions that are paid for under punitive tariff arrangements; erosion of elective income through tariff deflation; inflationary pressures in staff pay, consumables and PFI repayments; the transfer of £1.9 billion in funding away from the NHS through the integration transformation fund; and an unhelpful emphasis on competition at the expense of service sustainability.
default  
default 
default&#xa0;
default17.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe failure regime needs to be carefully calibrated.  The range and complexity of healthcare means that p
defaultockets of poor care can exist across all types of trust at various times, including in the very best trusts who manage risk well
default – it is those trusts who will be aware of their deficiencies and will work to improve the situation
default. 
default 
defaultThis is very different 
defaultfrom 
defaultconsistently struggling to meet a range of national standards.
default  We need a clear 
defaultand appropriately calibrated scale of failure and resulting consequences, 
defaultdesigned to deal with such chronic issues as experienced 
defaultat Mid Staffordshire at one end 
defaultof the spectrum 
defaultto an isolated incident in a single setting at the other.
default&#xa0;
default18.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNHS improvement models should draw more heavily on existing expertise within the sector, rather than management consultancy or the top-down, centrally driven models that have marked the service’s traditional approach to improvement. 
defaultWe need to learn to celebrate and share success. The FTN
default welcome
defaults
default the idea of 
default“
defaultbuddying
default”, with 
defaultthe best trusts supporting improvement 
defaultin others 
defaultwhere it is needed.
default  However, accountability 
defaultfor improving performance in a trust
default 
defaultcan only be the re
defaultsponsibility of the trust board.  I
defaultn Don Berwick’s words, 
default“When responsibility is diffused, it is not clearly well owned: with too many in charge, no one is”
default. 
default 
default&#xa0;
default19.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAt the same time, w
defaulte need to be careful about assuming that failure is solely a product of the individual institution. 
default 
defaultMost failing trusts tend to sit within failing wider local health and social care economies. 
default 
defaultA model that concentrates solely on improving individual trust leadership, without tackling the underlying wider structural issues and ensuring the whole system can work together effectively, is likely to fail.
default An 
defaulteffective failure regime must support trust boards to find the right solutions to what are usually complex, long established, system-wide, problems.  
default&#xa0;
default20.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPoliticians need to play a much greater role locally and nationally in leading the public debate on service transformation in the NHS and other public services, including in promoting the potential benefits of the reconfiguration of some services.
default&#xa0;
defaultQUESTION 11: Reviewing Payment by Results 
default21.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBetween 60 and 70% of acute services 
defaultin NHS providers 
defaultare
default currently
default funded through 
defaultthe NHS 
defaultPayment by Results (
defaultPbR
default)
default national tariff
default.  This 
defaultrules-based and transparent system supports patient choice as “
defaultmoney follow
defaults
default the patient
default”,
default and ensures providers are reimbursed for the services 
defaultthey provide
default.
default  
default&#xa0;
default22.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDifferent payment approaches are likely to be needed for different care needs, with room for local flexibility bounded by rules.  The FTN is supportive of 
defaultrules-based payment systems
default being adopted across other 
defaultnon-acute 
defaulthealthcare sectors with appropriate 
defaultadaptions
default being made to recognise the particular characteristics 
defaultand desired health outcomes 
defaultof those sectors.  For example,
default 
defaulta “year of care” payment approach
default for certain conditions, or
default blended approaches where a per person payment is combined with service delivery payment
default, 
defaultare likely to be applicable to the comm
defaultunity and mental health sectors
default. 
defaultIn the absence of such rules-based systems providers of NHS services will be put under unsustainable pressure as the demands on the service increase while funding is capped under current inflexible block contract arrangements. 
default 
default&#xa0;
default23.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, i
defaultn applying 
defaultPbR
default-style systems
default, it is critical that the rules and tariffs fully reflect the
default true
default cost of care and fulfil their policy intent.  For example, under the marginal rate policy, if the value of an acute hospital provider’s emergency admission activity exceeds its 2008/09
default 
defaultlevel
defaults, 
defaultthe provider only 
defaultreceives 30% of its full income for this extra activity. 
defaultThe aim was to incentivise admission avoidance and delivery of care closer to home.  
defaultHowever, 
defaultadmissions have risen in 
defaultalmost
default two thirds of hospitals since 2008/09. Hospitals are therefore being 
defaultsubstantially
default underpaid for their work and the financial impact is reducing 
defaultproviders’
default ability to implement admission avoidance initiatives
default to treat patients closer to home
default. 
defaultIn this case the “money follows the patient” ethos of 
defaultPbR
default is subverted and as a result the hospital sector is having over
default £300 million 
defaultin funding withheld each 
defaultyear
default.  
defaultThis is a clear example of payment systems being inappropriately used to micromanage care delivery – a more balanced approach to the use of payment systems is needed to achieve better care for patients
default. 
default&#xa0;
default24.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe pricing system should 
defaultalso more appropriately 
defaultrecognise capital investment
default and the additional costs of service transformation
default as a means of supporting better outcomes, through adoption of new technologies (which are often inflationary), or in changes to estate or delivery.  It will be important that innovation in care delivery is sufficiently enabled
default. We believe the NHS experience of different payment mechanisms, including 
defaultPbR
default and the emerging development of outcome-based contracting and payment systems, provide considerable learning for the wider public sector, and our members are similarly interested to adopt good practices from elsewhere.

defaultThe Foundation Trust Network (FTN) is the membership organisation and trade association for the NHS acute hospitals and community, mental health and ambulance services that treat patients and service users in the NHS. The FTN helps those NHS trusts deliver high quality, patient focussed, care by enabling them to learn from each other, acting as their public voice and helping shape the system in which they operate. The FTN has over 225 members – more than 90% of all NHS foundation trusts and aspirant trusts – who collectively account for £65 billion of annual expenditure and employ more than 630,000 staff.
