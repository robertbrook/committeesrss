[normal]DETAILED RESPONSE[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]QUESTION
[normal]S
[normal] 
[normal]1 and 3: Accountability to the people that use NHS services 
[normal]1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Foundation trusts (FTs) 
[normal]have a unique governance model which builds on the tradition of 
[normal]mutuals
[normal] and ensures the trust board is accountable to local communities
[normal] through members and governors
[normal].  FTs also 
[normal]benefit from greater financial fr
[normal]eedoms than NHS trusts, enabling them to respond more effectively to local needs
[normal].  There are now 
[normal]146 
[normal]FTs nationally, delivering acute, mental health, community and ambulance services
[normal] to their local communities
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The FT model of local governance helps empower the public and build in local accountability for significant sums of public expenditure.  Foundation trusts are embedded within the communities they serve, particularly as
[normal] 
[normal]members (comprising local individuals, staff, patients and carers) elect the majority of governors.  FT memberships and representative governor bodies also help foster public participation in the delivery of public services and promote social solidarity.  Engaging 
[normal]with patients and service users, and acting on their feedback, concerns and complaints, is central to robust governance and how the quality of care is viewed. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]QUESTION 2: Delivering better outcomes 
[normal]3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In May 2013, the FTN and Barclays published the findings of 
[normal]a 
[normal]joint project to examine the economic and social value that foundation trusts and NHS trusts add to their local communities.
[normal]  
[normal]All trusts clearly provide essential services to society by treating illness and protecting and improving the health 
[normal]of their populations but they are also often a major employer in their locality and add 
[normal]social value for communities in ways above and beyond their core role. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Social value seeks to capture the
[normal] 
[normal]broader impact of an activity on populations, communities and organisations. As major employers, trusts contribute directly to the economy locally and nationally, as well as supporting the long-term well-being of each of their employees as consumers, with families and lives outside of work, and indirectly, as citizens more generally.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Communities greatly value the wider social, economic
[normal] and environmental benefits generated by healthcare providers
[normal].  
[normal]In addition to the local governance and public participation fostered by FTs
[normal] (described above)
[normal], the social value of FTs and trusts 
[normal]is
[normal] illustrated 
[normal]as follows
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A
[normal]cross England, foundation trust activities contribute £30 billion annually to the economy. Their direct contribution– through employment, partnerships and procurement
[normal],
[normal] for example – is 
[normal]higher than that of universities, the pharmaceutical industry, or the aircraft and spacecraft industries.  In turn, they indirectly provide additional employment opportunities and economic benefits to their communities.
[normal] 
[normal] The economic value of trusts
[normal] includes:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]QUESTION 6: Working together to deliver public services 
[normal]7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The NHS increasingly has to provide care for people with long-term conditions and complex co-morbidities across different settings.  
[normal]Responding to these challenges and to patient expectations requires 
[normal]a system-wide shift towards integrated health and social care models which deliver better, more co-ordinated care for patients.  
[normal]Moves to integration may involve organisational, governance, budgetary or structural changes, but above all they need to improve patient pathways and experiences.  The desired result is effectively captured in 
[normal]the 
[normal]definition given by the 
[normal]Integrated Care and Support Collaborative: 
[normal]“My care is planned with people who work together to understand me and my carer(s), put me in control, co-ordinate and deliver services to achieve my best outcomes”.
[normal]   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Recent examples of integrated care and pathways which our members have led include: using ‘managed clinical networks’ to provide care and treatment for mental health patients who need a range of co-ordinated services; an NHS provider organisation / third sector partnership to create an integrated, early intervention service for dementia to provide a co-ordinated service to assess, diagnose and support people identified with early signs of dementia; a paramedic pathfinder tool which assists ambulance crews in deciding the most appropriate care service for patients; and deployment of 
[normal]joint emergency teams to
[normal] [bold]provide a multidisciplinary response within 24 hours to emergencies arising within the community.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Jon Rouse, DG Social Care at the Department of Health, has stated that international best practice suggests successful, patient-focussed, integrated health and care systems share 11 common 
[normal]features
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This list makes clear that successful health and social care integration depends on close working and alignment at all levels between and within providers, commissioners, Whitehall departments and statutory bodies.  It is a hugely complex task which faces strategic, financial and local operational challenges, but it is one which must be achieved if we are to retain quality care which is nationally affordable and meets 21
[normal]st
[normal] century needs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Government is currently implementing the Integration Transformation Fund to support more co-ordinated services between the acute sector and social care.  While FTN supports the principles driving the fund, we have considerable concerns about the transfer of funding from the NHS frontline in the next two years before new models have had chance to become embedded. There needs to be much greater recognition that achieving the integrated models we need requires time, investment and commitment, with the right incentives, resources, risk management and leadership in place. 
[normal]The NHS can't degrade or cut services or reduce frontline staff, 
[normal]in the context of
[normal] demand rising by 5% a year.  
[normal]To maintain 
[normal]existing NHS service delivery, the activities funded by investment in integration have to offset the risks caused by the transfer of funding
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]New models should be transparently developed and explained and best practice shared to assist with capability building and organisational adjustments.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]QUESTION 8: Choice and control of public services by citizens
[normal]12.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The FTN supports the use of 
[normal]patient 
[normal]choice
[normal] and improvements to patient information
[normal] as drivers of quality and service improvement, alongside other possible drivers
[normal]. Many of our members are directly involved in supporting patients to manage their own conditions and to take decisions about the choices of treatment, and of provider, available to them.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]At a policymaking level, government 
[normal]needs to be careful about how it balances the potentially competing agendas of competition and choice 
[normal]with
[normal] ensuring that NHS providers are financially and clinically sustainable
[normal] for the longer term
[normal].  The process of evaluating the impact of significant 
[normal]transactions (be they reconfigurations, mergers or other collaborations) 
[normal]should be streamlined and fit for purpose for the NHS.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Competition and choice can be successfully applied to drive up quality within the NHS, but with the important caveat that there is a need for a more refined set of industry specific guidance for the health sector
[normal] if it is to be workable.  
[normal]Industry specific guidance must centre 
[normal]on a 
[normal]fuller definition of ‘patient interest’ which
[normal] takes account of the 
[normal]longterm
[normal] financial and clinical sustainability of the trust, and
[normal], where proven, should override concerns about signif
[normal]icant lessening of competition and choice.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]QUESTION 9: Response to service delivery failure 
[normal]15.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The NHS is currently developing a regime to respond to situations 
[normal]when quality falls below required standards.  Recent announcements on the single failure
[normal] regime for quality and finance, 
[normal]special measures, 
[normal]and 
[normal]trust special administration arrangements have begun to clarify 
[normal]how 
[normal]the system
[normal] will operate
[normal].  However, further work is needed to ensure alignment and fitness for purpose. 
[normal] 
[normal]There needs to be a rigorous, independent, credible and carefully calibrated way of identifying quality failure and a system of consequences to follow. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]16.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Given the clear links between financial and quality failure, 
[normal]it is paramount that we
[normal] address the growing number of trusts that will 
[normal]– in the absence of appropriate support – 
[normal]become unsustainable 
[normal]as financial pressures increase.  
[normal]NHS providers are experiencing a toxic cocktail of pressures: rising demand for unplanned admissions that are paid for under punitive tariff arrangements; erosion of elective income through tariff deflation; inflationary pressures in staff pay, consumables and PFI repayments; the transfer of £1.9 billion in funding away from the NHS through the integration transformation fund; and an unhelpful emphasis on competition at the expense of service sustainability.
[normal]  
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The failure regime needs to be carefully calibrated.  The range and complexity of healthcare means that p
[normal]ockets of poor care can exist across all types of trust at various times, including in the very best trusts who manage risk well
[normal] – it is those trusts who will be aware of their deficiencies and will work to improve the situation
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]This is very different 
[normal]from 
[normal]consistently struggling to meet a range of national standards.
[normal]  We need a clear 
[normal]and appropriately calibrated scale of failure and resulting consequences, 
[normal]designed to deal with such chronic issues as experienced 
[normal]at Mid Staffordshire at one end 
[normal]of the spectrum 
[normal]to an isolated incident in a single setting at the other.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]18.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]NHS improvement models should draw more heavily on existing expertise within the sector, rather than management consultancy or the top-down, centrally driven models that have marked the service’s traditional approach to improvement. 
[normal]We need to learn to celebrate and share success. The FTN
[normal] welcome
[normal]s
[normal] the idea of 
[normal]“
[normal]buddying
[normal]”, with 
[normal]the best trusts supporting improvement 
[normal]in others 
[normal]where it is needed.
[normal]  However, accountability 
[normal]for improving performance in a trust
[normal] 
[normal]can only be the re
[normal]sponsibility of the trust board.  I
[normal]n Don Berwick’s words, 
[normal]“When responsibility is diffused, it is not clearly well owned: with too many in charge, no one is”
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]19.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]At the same time, w
[normal]e need to be careful about assuming that failure is solely a product of the individual institution. 
[normal] 
[normal]Most failing trusts tend to sit within failing wider local health and social care economies. 
[normal] 
[normal]A model that concentrates solely on improving individual trust leadership, without tackling the underlying wider structural issues and ensuring the whole system can work together effectively, is likely to fail.
[normal] An 
[normal]effective failure regime must support trust boards to find the right solutions to what are usually complex, long established, system-wide, problems.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]20.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Politicians need to play a much greater role locally and nationally in leading the public debate on service transformation in the NHS and other public services, including in promoting the potential benefits of the reconfiguration of some services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]QUESTION 11: Reviewing Payment by Results 
[normal]21.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Between 60 and 70% of acute services 
[normal]in NHS providers 
[normal]are
[normal] currently
[normal] funded through 
[normal]the NHS 
[normal]Payment by Results (
[normal]PbR
[normal])
[normal] national tariff
[normal].  This 
[normal]rules-based and transparent system supports patient choice as “
[normal]money follow
[normal]s
[normal] the patient
[normal]”,
[normal] and ensures providers are reimbursed for the services 
[normal]they provide
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]22.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Different payment approaches are likely to be needed for different care needs, with room for local flexibility bounded by rules.  The FTN is supportive of 
[normal]rules-based payment systems
[normal] being adopted across other 
[normal]non-acute 
[normal]healthcare sectors with appropriate 
[normal]adaptions
[normal] being made to recognise the particular characteristics 
[normal]and desired health outcomes 
[normal]of those sectors.  For example,
[normal] 
[normal]a “year of care” payment approach
[normal] for certain conditions, or
[normal] blended approaches where a per person payment is combined with service delivery payment
[normal], 
[normal]are likely to be applicable to the comm
[normal]unity and mental health sectors
[normal]. 
[normal]In the absence of such rules-based systems providers of NHS services will be put under unsustainable pressure as the demands on the service increase while funding is capped under current inflexible block contract arrangements. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]23.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, i
[normal]n applying 
[normal]PbR
[normal]-style systems
[normal], it is critical that the rules and tariffs fully reflect the
[normal] true
[normal] cost of care and fulfil their policy intent.  For example, under the marginal rate policy, if the value of an acute hospital provider’s emergency admission activity exceeds its 2008/09
[normal] 
[normal]level
[normal]s, 
[normal]the provider only 
[normal]receives 30% of its full income for this extra activity. 
[normal]The aim was to incentivise admission avoidance and delivery of care closer to home.  
[normal]However, 
[normal]admissions have risen in 
[normal]almost
[normal] two thirds of hospitals since 2008/09. Hospitals are therefore being 
[normal]substantially
[normal] underpaid for their work and the financial impact is reducing 
[normal]providers’
[normal] ability to implement admission avoidance initiatives
[normal] to treat patients closer to home
[normal]. 
[normal]In this case the “money follows the patient” ethos of 
[normal]PbR
[normal] is subverted and as a result the hospital sector is having over
[normal] £300 million 
[normal]in funding withheld each 
[normal]year
[normal].  
[normal]This is a clear example of payment systems being inappropriately used to micromanage care delivery – a more balanced approach to the use of payment systems is needed to achieve better care for patients
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]24.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The pricing system should 
[normal]also more appropriately 
[normal]recognise capital investment
[normal] and the additional costs of service transformation
[normal] as a means of supporting better outcomes, through adoption of new technologies (which are often inflationary), or in changes to estate or delivery.  It will be important that innovation in care delivery is sufficiently enabled
[normal]. We believe the NHS experience of different payment mechanisms, including 
[normal]PbR
[normal] and the emerging development of outcome-based contracting and payment systems, provide considerable learning for the wider public sector, and our members are similarly interested to adopt good practices from elsewhere.

[normal]The Foundation Trust Network (FTN) is the membership organisation and trade association for the NHS acute hospitals and community, mental health and ambulance services that treat patients and service users in the NHS. The FTN helps those NHS trusts deliver high quality, patient focussed, care by enabling them to learn from each other, acting as their public voice and helping shape the system in which they operate. The FTN has over 225 members – more than 90% of all NHS foundation trusts and aspirant trusts – who collectively account for £65 billion of annual expenditure and employ more than 630,000 staff.
