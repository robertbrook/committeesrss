"VEP 0003&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of England and Wales Department for Christian Responsibility and Citizenship and CSAN (Caritas Social Action Network), the domestic social action agency of the Bishops’ Conference (VEP0003)&#xa0;\nI.\n              \nIntroduction\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nII. \n              \nExecutive Summary\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAll human persons, including convicted criminals, have an inalienable and irreducible status (human dignity), which is not at the disposal of the State and in which all rights and obligations are ultimately grounded. However human dignity, justice, and mercy are undermined by the blanket ban\n that prevents prisoners from voting\n.\n It is our view, therefore, that the blanket ban is, as a matter of principle, unjust, illogical, and morally wrong.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPrisoners do not cease to be UK citizens whilst in prison. The philosophical concept of ‘civic death’ has been rightly abandoned and therefore it cannot be used to justify the disenfranchisement of prisoners. \n&#xa0;\nThe generally accepted purposes of punishment are: retribution, incapacitation, deterrence, and reform and rehabilitation. The primary aim of punishment is the reduction of crime, the preservation of public order, and public safety. These aims are more likely to be achieved if prisoners are offered help to rehabilitate and change their behaviour; indeed, it is now generally accepted that purely retributive systems do not work\n. Disenfranchising prisoners does not further the aims of punishment; however giving prisoners the vote might. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe stand to suffer as a nation, both at home and abroad, if we do not change our domestic legislation. The disenfranchisement of prisoners undermines the democratic legitimacy of Parliament, marks the beginning of a political underclass, reinforces the negative public perception of prisoners and thus hinders resettlement, weakens the European Convention on Human Rights (‘the Convention’), and weakens the authority of the UK when commenting upon human rights violations in other countries. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhen a person enters prison it is only his liberty that is restricted, therefore a restriction of any of his other rights (including the right to vote) must be independently justified. Removal of the right to vote by virtue of imprisonment alone is disproportionate and cannot be justified. \n&#xa0;\nA decision to flout the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights (‘ECHR’) will undermine the \nRule of Law\n, it will set a bad example to other countries, and it may cause the UK to lose the respect of other parties to the Convention. Refusing to grant prisoners the vote may also result huge financial repercussions.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIII. \n              \nChristian Teaching\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIV. \n              \nThe Purpose of Punishment/Imprisonment\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nhowever it should be noted that the final three justifications share a common purpose/aim: stopping crime, maintaining public order, and thus keeping society safe.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDepriving such people of their right to vote only exacerbates the problem by furthering the divide between prisoners and the rest of society. If we truly wish to cut crime then we must not turn our backs on prisoners and forget about them; instead we should put them on the path to reform by showing them that they have a continuing stake in, and duty towards, the community into which they will return. We should encourage our prisoners to play a positive role in shaping their own futures by showing them that it is possible for them to better themselves and improve their situations by becoming authors of their own transformation. Restoring the vote\n would renegotiate the balance between the rights of society and the rights of the individual, and it could show prisoners that there are ways to better oneself that do not involve committing further offences. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nV.\n              \nPolitical Implications\n&#xa0;\nPolitical Implications At Home:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPolitical Implications Abroad:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nVI.\n              \nLegal Implications\n&#xa0;\nThe Rule of Law: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nLegal Implications At Home:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nLegal Implications Abroad:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nVII.\n              \nConclusion\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJune 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n    \nhttp://www.catholicnews.org.uk/a-place-of-redemption-2004\n&#xa0;\n \n              \nThe Ministry of Justice, \n‘Breaking the Cycle: Effective Punishment, Rehabilitation and Sentencing of Offenders’\n December 2010 – The MoJ recognised that punishment alone was not enough to protect the public. In order to break the destructive cycle of reoffending, the MoJ stated that there also needed to be a focus on rehabilitation. \n&#xa0;David Cameron\n, 22\nnd\n October 2012, \n“Just being tough isn’t a successful strategy in itself. Come with me to any prison in this country. There you’ll meet muggers, robbers, and burglars. But you’ll also meet young people who can’t read, teenagers addicted to drugs, people who’ve never worked a day in their whole lives. These people need help so they can become part of the solution and not remain part of the problem. Recognising this isn’t soft, or liberal. It’s common sense. We’ll never create a safer society unless we give people, especially young people, opportunities and chances away from crime. Prevention is the cheapest and most effective way to deal with crime – everything else is simply picking up the pieces of failure that has gone before. That’s part of what I mean by being intelligent as well as tough….The only way to achieve our ambitions is reform – radical, intelligent reform. So much of what went wrong in public services previously wasn’t because the money was missing, it was because the methods were wrong.”\n&#xa0;\n \n              \nHirst v The United Kingdom (No. 2)\n (Application no. 74025/01) \n&#xa0;\n \n              \nJohn Paul II, \nJubilee Year Statement on Prisons\n, page 5.\n&#xa0;\n \n              \nDives in Misericordia\n page\n \n4, and \nA Place of Redemption\n page 34.\n&#xa0;\n \n              \nThese were cited in the House of Commons Library Research Paper 12/71 22\nnd\n November 2012, \n‘Reducing Offending: The “What Works” Debate’.\n They were cited in the Irish \nPenal Reform Trust Annual Lecture 16th September 2011\n – Department of Justice and Equality \nhttp://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/SP11000177\n and have been cited in many other jurisdictions outside the UK.\n&#xa0;\n \n              \nHirst v The United Kingdom (No. 2)\n (Application no. 74025/01), para 82\n&#xa0;\n     \nIbid.\n&#xa0;\n \n              \nSee footnote 1\n&#xa0;\n \n              \nMoJ Response to FOI request from CSAN/CBCEW 12 January 2013; DCLG Response to FOI request from CSAN/CBCEW 15 January 2013; Cabinet Office Response to FOI request from CSAN/CBCEW 21 February 2013\n&#xa0;\n \n              \n57% of all adults are reconvicted within one year of release, this rises to 57% for those who have served less than twelve months, and 67% for those who have served 11 or more previous custodial sentences.
