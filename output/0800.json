"Written evidence from Vertex Pharmaceuticals UK (LTC 50)&#xa0;&#xa0;1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nVertex’s product \nKal\nydeco\n (\nivacaftor\n) \nis the first in a new class of innovative medicines that treats the underlying causes of \ncystic fibrosis, a genetic disease affecting approximately 10,000 people in the UK.\n \n&#xa0;\n1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nKalydeco has been available to all patients with the G551D mutation in England since 1\nst\n January 2013.\n \nThis has a number of implications for the commissioning and delivery of specialised services for cystic fibrosis\n, particularly in relation to NICE’s appraisal process for Highly Specialised Technologies and NHS England’s \nclinical commissioning policies for higher-cost medicines\n.\n \n&#xa0;&#xa0;2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nVertex is a global health sciences company that aims to accelerate the discovery, development, and commercialisation of critical medicines for life-threatening diseases including \ncystic fibrosis\n, hepatitis C, and epilepsy.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn 1998, Vertex established its first global research and development\n \nsite in the \nUK\n. Researchers at Vertex’s approximately 150-person UK site are focused on discovering new medicines for a variety of cancer types and \nneuroinflammatory\n diseases.\n \n&#xa0;&#xa0;3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCystic fibrosis\n is \na genetic disease\n affecting \napproximately \n10\n,000 people \nin the UK.\n \nIt is a complex and multi-system disease that causes the internal organs, particularly the lungs and dig\nestive system, to produce thick\n sticky mucus that eventually leads to death from respiratory failure.\n \nIn 2011 t\nhe median age at death for \ncystic fibrosis \npatients \nwas 26 years\n.\n \n&#xa0;3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCystic fibrosis is also associated with other long-term conditions including \ndiabetes, \ninfertility\n,\n and osteoporosis.\n \n&#xa0;3.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \ncare of \nchildren and adults with \ncystic fibrosis \nis coordinated by specialised services\n that are directly commissioned by NHS England\n.\n \nThese specialised services provide \ncare from a multidisciplinary team including specialist doctors, nurses, and allied health professionals.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nVertex’s product \nKalydeco \nreceived regulatory approval for the \ntreatment of \ncystic fibrosis\n in patients aged six years and older who have a G551D mutation in the \ncystic fibrosis\n \ntransmembrane\n conductance regulator (\nCFTR\n)\n gene from the European Medicines Agency in July 2012.\n \n&#xa0;4.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn 2011 there were 466 cystic fibrosis patients with a copy of this mutation in UK.\n \nDue to this small patient population \nKalydeco is \nw\nidely recognised as an ultra-orphan medicine\n \n(i.e. a treatment for a very rare disease).\n \n&#xa0;\n4.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nKalydeco\n \nis the first in a new class of innovative medicines \nthat \ntreats \nthe underlying causes of \ncystic fibrosis\n.\n \nThe results of clinical trials indicate that treatment with Kalydeco could lead to a 10-year increase in life-expectancy and a significant improvement in quality of life.\n \n4.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nKalydeco\n \nhas been \navailable to all patients with the \nG551D mutation in England since 1\nst\n January 2013 following a commissioning decision made by the Clinical Priorities Advisory Group.\n \nSince 1\nst\n April 2013 it has been commissioned on a national basis by NHS England.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;5.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUK clinicians have noted that Kalydeco \n‘is life changing for the few patients with cystic fibrosis for whom it is indicated’ and, as the first medicine of its kind, \n‘has the potential to transform cystic fibrosis\n care’\n.\n \nT\nhis \ntransformation in cystic fibrosis care \nmay require \nchanges to the way that specialised services and treatments for the disease are commissioned and delivered.\n \n&#xa0;\nNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence&#xa0;\n5.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) assumed responsibility for the appraisal of H\nighly Specialised Technologies (i.e. \nultra-orphan medicines\n) \non 1\nst\n April 2013.\n \nIt is essential that NICE’s appraisal process for Highly Specialised Technologi\nes recognises the value of innovative medicines for th\ne treatment of very rare clinical subsets of more common diseases, \nparticularly long-ter\nm conditions for which there is \nno cure, \nand takes this into account when making its recommendations.\n \n&#xa0;NHS England&#xa0;\n5.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlthough t\nhe majority of medicines for the treatment of cystic fibrosis are funded \nusing \nthe Payment by Results \nsystem, \ncertain higher-cost medicines are \ndirectly commissioned\n by NHS England.\n \nIt is essential that this direct commissioning continues to ensure \ncystic fibrosis patients have \nequitable access to\n highe\nr-cost medicines across England\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n5.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI\nf Kalydeco and other innovative new medicine for cystic fibrosis lead to a reduction in \nexacerbations and \nhospital admissions, \nit may \nbe possible to redesign some services to allow patients to receive a larger proportion of their \ncare \nin the community\n.\n \nThis would be likely to lead to further improvements to patients’ quality of life and reduce the costs of providing specialist services in a hospital setting.\n \nMay 2013\n \nCystic fibrosis\n Trust.\n \nAnnual Data Report 2011 (2013).\n \nAvailable at https://www.cysti\ncystic fibrosis\nibrosis.org.uk/media/82506/CR_Annual_Data_Report_2011_Jan_13.pdf\n NHS England.\n \nClinical Commissioning Policy: \nIvacaftor\n for Cystic Fibrosis (2013).\n \nAvailable at http://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/a01-p-b.pdf\n Cystic fibrosis Trust.\n \nAnnual Data Report 2011 (2013).\n \nAvailable at https://www.cysticystic fibrosisibrosis.org.uk/media/82506/CR_Annual_Data_Report_2011_Jan_13.pdf\n All Wales Medicines Strategy Group.\n \nClinical Expert Summary (2013).\n \nAvailable at http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sites3/Documents/371/Enc%207%20Appx%203%20ivacaftor%20%28Kalydeco%29%20Clinical%20Expert%20Summary.pdf\n"
