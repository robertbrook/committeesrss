"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nYogesh\n Raja\n (CYS0004)\nFollowing suggestion will drastically improve safety of cyclists and motor cyclists in Britain.\n&#xa0;\nI suggest cyclists should attach beacon flashing lights to their helmets which will make them visible to everyone even in day light the way it does with \npolice cars etc. Such battery or reachable battery operated beacons are available at nominal price in market. This system will motivate cyclists wear their helmets.\n&#xa0;\nThis idea would also make motorcycle ride\nrs safer\n too by making them visible to everyone e\nven from distance.\n&#xa0;\nWould you agree that unless we find a better system we should exploit proposed\n to make cyclists\n safer.\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
