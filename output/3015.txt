[[[Written evidence from UK Major Ports Group (SRN 025)]]]

[[[Summary]]]1              Ports are crucial to the UK’s economic development. Connecting links to ports are international gateways and have rightly been recognised as priority areas for strategic road investment though it is disappointing that this has yet to be confirmed in the long awaited National Policy Statement for national networks in England. 

[[[Introduction]]]2              UKMPG is one of two associations representing ports in the UK.  Our 9 member groups handle over 70 percent of the UK’s international trade by volume, and therefore play a significant role in supporting the UK economy and promoting exports.  UK ports are privately financed and do not seek any financial help from the taxpayer.  3              Earlier this year the independent economic consultants Oxford Economics produced a report on the economic impact of the UK ports sector in 2011, updating their previous studies which used 2007 and 2009 figures. &#xa0;Their data shows that the ports sector consistently outperforms most other sectors for employment and productivity - for example, between 2009 and 2011 direct employment in ports rose by 5% to 117,200 , while overall UK employment fell by 0.4%. &#xa0;The key measure of labour productivity, GVA (Gross Value Added) per worker, averaged over £67,400 in the ports sector, nearly 40% higher than the UK-economy-wide average of £48,400.4              Overall this latest report shows the ports sector continuing to improve productivity and to make a significant contribution to the UK economy despite testing trading conditions. &#xa0;The maritime sector as a whole supports over half a million jobs in the UK economy and contributes nearly £32 billion to UK GDP, with the ports sector accounting for well over half of this. &#xa0;These figures, together with the fact that 95% of the country's international trade moves through ports, show how vital ports are to the UK's economic performance.

[[[Government’s policy on links to ports ]]]5              Access to ports featured strongly in the previous Government’s policy on promoting infrastructure. The ports sector gave a strong welcome to the transport study by Sir Rod Eddington published in December 2006.  We were particularly pleased to see the report’s recognition that, given the international nature of the UK’s economy, good links to international gateways such as ports were crucially important, offered a high rate of return and should be a priority area for future DfT investment.  We were also pleased that the previous Government acted quickly to implement Eddington’s findings through:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; setting up a new streamlined planning system for major infrastructure projects through the provisions of the Planning Act 2008;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; putting major ports at the centre of the strategic transport corridors set out in the white paper “Delivering a Sustainable Transport System” (DASTS), published in November 2008;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; bringing forward several major road and rail projects improving links to ports under the Transport Innovation Fund, Strategic Freight Network and accelerated Highways Agency programmes.6              The present Coalition Government has yet to set out a comprehensive position statement on transport infrastructure priorities. The promised national policy statement on national (road and rail) networks has been substantially delayed. UKMPG assumes therefore that the previous Government’s policies are being rolled forward at least for the time being. 

[[[Recent developments]]]

[[[ on strategic roads]]]7              The Chancellor’s Spending Review 2015 statement of 26 June announced that there would be extra capital investment on transport programmes with the DfT capital line up by £600m in 2015/6 to £9.5bn (a rise of 5.5% in real terms). More significantly it also announced  -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; that the 2014 capital settlement would extend to 2020 so representing a 6 year settlement thereby giving greater confidence that listed schemes would actually be built-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; specific detail on the schemes which would be going ahead over this period (this is normally left to Departments to work out once they have been allocated their budget lines)8              The strategy document recognized that the UK has been underspending on roads in comparison with its major EU competitor economies. So over 50% of the capital investment programme is to be used to increase capacity on the motorway and trunk road network and carry out repairs (also on the local road network). Several of the schemes mentioned are of particular interest to ports including the following schemesA1 north of Newcastle, A19 south of Newcastle and A14 between Cambridge and Huntingdon (still linked to a tolling scheme). 9              Also of significance is the proposal to turn the Highways Agency into a publicly owned corporation with greater long term funding certainty. The main advantage cited is the potential to achieve £600m of capital efficiency savings; equally important is the opportunity this will provide for the successor HA to build up better strategic relationships with key industry customers such as ports.

[[[Action for Roads]]]10              This was followed on 16 July by the Department for Transport White Paper on roads entitled ‘Action for roads: A network for the 21st century'.  Action for Roads provides some more detail on how this programme is to be delivered in England. The main elements are11              The Government’s objective is to get investment levels back up to those in continental competitor economies, with capital spending on roads effectively ring fenced as already is rail investment. There is little additional information in Action for Roads about the actual investment programme though there is a useful summary map on page 31 showing major projects starting by 2015, pipeline projects starting after 2015 and pinch point schemes. Several of these should be of direct benefit to ports. Ports have been participating actively in Highways Agency workshops on route based strategies designed to identify bottlenecks and develop solutions.

[[[UKMPG overall view]]]12              Overall this is a welcome package particularly the move to increased capital investment on strategic roads, a longer investment planning period and more funding certainty. This is a clear improvement on the present arrangements which provides no long term certainty or strategic coherence and is too often influenced by short-term political expediencies. We do however have several areas of concern &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Specific comments on questions posed by the Committee]]]&#xa0;

[[[How will the policies set out in the Government’s “Action for Roads” command paper improve the strat]]]

[[[egic road network for all road users, whilst also improving the environment?]]]&#xa0;By securing greater longer term funding certainty which should enable the strategic road programme to be developed without the risk of delays and postponements. The new structure for the Highways Agency should enable it to focus more on key delivery areas and develop stronger links with stakeholders&#xa0;

[[[How does the Government’s policy for roads link with planning for other transport modes?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]This remains uncertain because of the continued non appearance of the National Policy Statement for road and rail. It is important that the contribution that rail and coastal shipping can make to reducing traffic by road is properly factored into to strategic road planning. There is also a need for strong co-ordination across road and rail policies and agencies.&#xa0; For example the ongoing review of track access charges for rail freight could impact on the volume of traffic using the strategic road network.&#xa0; However the review is being conducted by the rail regulator in isolation and the potential impact of changes on other modes is not being taken into account.

[[[How can we improve the reliability and efficiency of travel on the strategic road network? What impact will new technology have?]]]UKMPG supports the continued investment in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS)&#xa0;in order to maximise capacity and efficiency and inform users of road conditions and accidents.&#xa0; The Government should continue its dialogue with the ITS industry and automotive industry manufacturers to confirm that road infrastructure can support technology investment but also engage with ports and their logistics partners to ensure that the benefits of ITS are utilised to their maximum benefit.&#xa0;
