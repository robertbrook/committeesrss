[normal]Written evidence from the Police and Crime Commissioner for Dorset [CST0056][bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am the Police and Crime Commissioner for 
[normal]Dorset
[normal]. I have previously submitted a response to your November questionnaire on Crime Statistics. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In relation to the 
[normal]questions from the Chair of the Public Administration 
[normal]Select Committee 
[normal]to Police and Crime Commissioners regarding this 
[normal]enquiry
[normal], 
[normal]I am grateful to be invited to 
[normal]further 
[normal]contribute, and respond as follows:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1. [bold]              [bold]What, if any, targets do you[bold] set for your police force? What impact do you think this has on police recording crime practices?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1
[normal]              
[normal]I share the commonly held concern that setting targets can encourage "massaging" of statistics, and I welcome the current Government’s drive to remove t
[normal]hem. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]              
[normal]However, from a localism point of view, the public of 
[normal]Dorset
[normal] made it clear to me that some areas of policing were in need of improvement, and therefore I have set some targets; although few compared to most other Forces.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]              
[normal]The targets that ar
[normal]e set relate directly to achieving the outcomes of the Police and Crime Plan and must be considered in tandem.  I shall therefore list the targets set under each priority.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Priority 1:  Reduce the Number of Victims of Crime and Anti-Social Behaviour
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4
[normal]              
[normal]T
[normal]argets set:
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]Priority 2:  Reduce the Number of People Seriously Harmed in 
[normal]Dorset
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5
[normal]              
[normal]Target set:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]Priority 3
[normal]:  Help Protect the Public from Serious Threats (Local, Regional and National) to their Safety including Organised C
[normal]rime and Terrorism
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.6
[normal]              
[normal]Target set:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]Priority 4
[normal]:  Reduce Re-Offending
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.7
[normal]              
[normal]Target set:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Priority 5
[normal]:  Increase People’s Satisfaction with Policing in 
[normal]Dorset
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.8
[normal]              
[normal]Targets set:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Priority 6
[normal]:  Support Neighbourh
[normal]ood Policing that is appropriate for both Rural and Urban Communities in 
[normal]Dorset
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.9
[normal]              
[normal]Target set:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.10
[normal]              
[normal]In relation to the second part of the question, some targets are very difficult to manipulate, for example the target set in relation to how long 
[normal]staff take to answer a non-emergency
[normal] call. This is derived electronically from a database. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.11
[normal]              
[normal]However, I am the first to appreciate that one of my targets, the positive outcome rate, could drive manipulation and perverse behaviour. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.12
[normal]              
[normal]I considered 
[normal]this when setting the target, and I will answer below in Question 2 what we do to ensure this does not happen.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.13
[normal]              
[normal]I did not set targets without good reason. For example, the main targets above are addressing the two key issues the public told me they ha
[normal]d with Dorset Police, namely:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.14
[normal]              
[normal]In relation, statistically, to the number of criminals caught, 
[normal]the detection rate had to be addressed. 
[normal] 
[normal]Dorset
[normal] was one of the worst perfor
[normal]ming 
[normal]f
[normal]orces in the country when I was elected. The media reported on this with worrying headlines such as "
[normal]Only 
[normal]1 in 5 criminals in 
[normal]Dorset
[normal] caught". I had to 
[normal]deal with this
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.15
[normal]              
[normal]So, any 
[normal]target set was 
[normal]put there f
[normal]or a good reason. 
[normal]And such targets allow me to hold the Chief Constable to account over that particular area. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.16
[normal]              
[normal]For example, although the detection rate has risen steadily since my election, the performance in the call handling system, 101, declined month on month last
[normal] year, and the targets set allowed me to see this, and formally challenge accordingly.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.17
[normal]              
[normal]This challenge has worked - performance in the Police Enquiry Centre has improved dramatically since July. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. [bold]              [bold]How do you assure yourself that the recorded crime figures for your area are correct? To what extent can you trust the crime statistics for your area? [bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.1 
[normal]              
[normal]Let me explain how I assure myself that recorded crime figures are correct.  As PCC, I have variou
[normal]s governance methods over crime recording.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1.1
[normal]              
[normal]Firstly, I have faith in my force because of the HMIC Inspection Reports, which clearly indicate a good culture of crime recording.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1.2
[normal]              
[normal]Secondly, I co-chair the Force Performance Board with the 
[normal]Deputy 
[normal]Chief Constable. This Board deals with exception reporting of all crime statistics, and has a selected crime topic each quarter. This allows me to see issues in recording practices, as well as emerging crime trends. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1.3
[normal]              
[normal]Lastly, I am quite "hands on" wi
[normal]th these issues. I am fortunate to be an ex detective. I therefore have a very good grasp of the NCRS, and the role of the Crime Management Unit and the Force Registrar.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1.4
[normal]              
[normal]I regularly meet with the Force Crime and Incident Registrar. These meetings dr
[normal]ill down into recording practice, and blockages in recording crime and anti-social behaviour. Issues that become apparent are taken to the Deputy Chief Constable (DCC). I have now increased these meetings to bi-monthly.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1.5
[normal]              
[normal]The DCC meets the Force Cr
[normal]ime and Incident Registrar monthly, to scrutinise recording practice. I have been impressed with this scrutiny. The DCC personally writes to officers (and their line manager) if a discrepancy in crime recording is found. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1.6
[normal]              
[normal]Since the Kent Police HMIC 
[normal]inspection, and more notably, since the evidence heard by your Committee recently, the Force and I have now formalised this issue to make governance more accountable and transparent. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1.7
[normal]              
[normal]The meetings between the DCC and Force Registrar are now minuted,
[normal] as are my bi-monthly meetings with them both.   These minutes, and responsibility for governance of Crime Recording now sit under the Ethics Committee set up since my election. The Ethics Committee acts on my behalf and reports to the Audit Committee also
[normal] set up since my election. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1.8
[normal]              
[normal]The public clearly have the right to complain about crime investigation or recording. The Ethics Committee "dip check" police complaints on my behalf.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]              
[normal]I am 99% confident that all police interventions are 
[normal]recorded
[normal] as the Command and Control system ensures by default that the officers satisfactorily record an outcome to a police attendance/intervention. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]              
[normal]I am slightly less confident that all police interventions are 
[normal]correctly recorded as crimes
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]This
[normal] is for the following reasons:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3.1
[normal]              
[normal]The Command and Control system allows officers to record an incident as an anti-social behaviour incident as well as a crime. This is 
[normal]partly because of the confusing scenario where an incident could be classed as "both
[normal]". This then potentially leads to the double counting of individual incidents as both ASB and crimes.
[normal]2.3.2
[normal]              
[normal]I know from my experience as a Crime Manager supervising a Crime Management Centre that the only way to say you are 99% confident in your crime reco
[normal]rding statistics is to have every crime checked by an 
[normal]independent scrutiniser. My Force does not do this, because of resource issues. I referred to this in my November submission. However, monthly audits are conducted which are overseen by the Deputy Chief
[normal] Constable. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3.3
[normal]              
[normal]In addition, t
[normal]he Force 
[normal]Crime and Incident 
[normal]Registrar 
[normal]carries out
[normal] spot checks, and the Force has recently changed procedures in the Force Control Room to ensure that logs are correctly filed with an outcome.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3.4
[normal]              
[normal]To achieve total indepe
[normal]ndent scrutiny of the crime recording system would mean increasing the Force Registrar team by three full time posts, amounting to a cost of roughly £100,000 pa, no mean feat in the current times of austerity. The Force and I are exploring this at the mome
[normal]nt. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3.5
[normal]              
[normal]However, let us put this in context. The British Crime Survey and EU police crime statistics both show a reduction in crime. There is no doubt in my mind that crime is falling, although there is clear evidence that this fall is starting to leve
[normal]l out. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3.6
[normal]              
[normal]One cannot comment on crime recording without raising the unknown factor of non-reporting by the public. This factor must always be considered in the round. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal]              
[normal]In summary, I would say that I am "reasonably confident" that I can trust the 
[normal]crime statistics in my area. However, as previously stated, one should never be complacent.
