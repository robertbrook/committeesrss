defaultWritten evidence from the Police and Crime Commissioner for Dorset [CST0056]default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultI am the Police and Crime Commissioner for 
defaultDorset
default. I have previously submitted a response to your November questionnaire on Crime Statistics. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn relation to the 
defaultquestions from the Chair of the Public Administration 
defaultSelect Committee 
defaultto Police and Crime Commissioners regarding this 
defaultenquiry
default, 
defaultI am grateful to be invited to 
defaultfurther 
defaultcontribute, and respond as follows:
default&#xa0;
default1. default              defaultWhat, if any, targets do youdefault set for your police force? What impact do you think this has on police recording crime practices?default&#xa0;
default1.1
default              
defaultI share the commonly held concern that setting targets can encourage "massaging" of statistics, and I welcome the current Government’s drive to remove t
defaulthem. 
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default              
defaultHowever, from a localism point of view, the public of 
defaultDorset
default made it clear to me that some areas of policing were in need of improvement, and therefore I have set some targets; although few compared to most other Forces.
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default              
defaultThe targets that ar
defaulte set relate directly to achieving the outcomes of the Police and Crime Plan and must be considered in tandem.  I shall therefore list the targets set under each priority.
default&#xa0;
defaultPriority 1:  Reduce the Number of Victims of Crime and Anti-Social Behaviour
default&#xa0;
default1.4
default              
defaultT
defaultargets set:
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default              
default              
defaultPriority 2:  Reduce the Number of People Seriously Harmed in 
defaultDorset
default&#xa0;
default1.5
default              
defaultTarget set:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultPriority 3
default:  Help Protect the Public from Serious Threats (Local, Regional and National) to their Safety including Organised C
defaultrime and Terrorism
default&#xa0;
default1.6
default              
defaultTarget set:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultPriority 4
default:  Reduce Re-Offending
default&#xa0;
default1.7
default              
defaultTarget set:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultPriority 5
default:  Increase People’s Satisfaction with Policing in 
defaultDorset
default&#xa0;
default1.8
default              
defaultTargets set:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultPriority 6
default:  Support Neighbourh
defaultood Policing that is appropriate for both Rural and Urban Communities in 
defaultDorset
default&#xa0;
default1.9
default              
defaultTarget set:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default1.10
default              
defaultIn relation to the second part of the question, some targets are very difficult to manipulate, for example the target set in relation to how long 
defaultstaff take to answer a non-emergency
default call. This is derived electronically from a database. 
default&#xa0;
default1.11
default              
defaultHowever, I am the first to appreciate that one of my targets, the positive outcome rate, could drive manipulation and perverse behaviour. 
default&#xa0;
default1.12
default              
defaultI considered 
defaultthis when setting the target, and I will answer below in Question 2 what we do to ensure this does not happen.
default&#xa0;
default1.13
default              
defaultI did not set targets without good reason. For example, the main targets above are addressing the two key issues the public told me they ha
defaultd with Dorset Police, namely:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default1.14
default              
defaultIn relation, statistically, to the number of criminals caught, 
defaultthe detection rate had to be addressed. 
default 
defaultDorset
default was one of the worst perfor
defaultming 
defaultf
defaultorces in the country when I was elected. The media reported on this with worrying headlines such as "
defaultOnly 
default1 in 5 criminals in 
defaultDorset
default caught". I had to 
defaultdeal with this
default.  
default&#xa0;
default1.15
default              
defaultSo, any 
defaulttarget set was 
defaultput there f
defaultor a good reason. 
defaultAnd such targets allow me to hold the Chief Constable to account over that particular area. 
default&#xa0;
default1.16
default              
defaultFor example, although the detection rate has risen steadily since my election, the performance in the call handling system, 101, declined month on month last
default year, and the targets set allowed me to see this, and formally challenge accordingly.
default&#xa0;
default1.17
default              
defaultThis challenge has worked - performance in the Police Enquiry Centre has improved dramatically since July. 
default&#xa0;
default2. default              defaultHow do you assure yourself that the recorded crime figures for your area are correct? To what extent can you trust the crime statistics for your area? default&#xa0;default2.1 
default              
defaultLet me explain how I assure myself that recorded crime figures are correct.  As PCC, I have variou
defaults governance methods over crime recording.  
default&#xa0;
default2.1.1
default              
defaultFirstly, I have faith in my force because of the HMIC Inspection Reports, which clearly indicate a good culture of crime recording.
default&#xa0;
default2.1.2
default              
defaultSecondly, I co-chair the Force Performance Board with the 
defaultDeputy 
defaultChief Constable. This Board deals with exception reporting of all crime statistics, and has a selected crime topic each quarter. This allows me to see issues in recording practices, as well as emerging crime trends. 
default&#xa0;
default2.1.3
default              
defaultLastly, I am quite "hands on" wi
defaultth these issues. I am fortunate to be an ex detective. I therefore have a very good grasp of the NCRS, and the role of the Crime Management Unit and the Force Registrar.
default&#xa0;
default2.1.4
default              
defaultI regularly meet with the Force Crime and Incident Registrar. These meetings dr
defaultill down into recording practice, and blockages in recording crime and anti-social behaviour. Issues that become apparent are taken to the Deputy Chief Constable (DCC). I have now increased these meetings to bi-monthly.   
default&#xa0;
default2.1.5
default              
defaultThe DCC meets the Force Cr
defaultime and Incident Registrar monthly, to scrutinise recording practice. I have been impressed with this scrutiny. The DCC personally writes to officers (and their line manager) if a discrepancy in crime recording is found. 
default&#xa0;
default2.1.6
default              
defaultSince the Kent Police HMIC 
defaultinspection, and more notably, since the evidence heard by your Committee recently, the Force and I have now formalised this issue to make governance more accountable and transparent. 
default&#xa0;
default2.1.7
default              
defaultThe meetings between the DCC and Force Registrar are now minuted,
default as are my bi-monthly meetings with them both.   These minutes, and responsibility for governance of Crime Recording now sit under the Ethics Committee set up since my election. The Ethics Committee acts on my behalf and reports to the Audit Committee also
default set up since my election. 
default&#xa0;
default2.1.8
default              
defaultThe public clearly have the right to complain about crime investigation or recording. The Ethics Committee "dip check" police complaints on my behalf.
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default              
defaultI am 99% confident that all police interventions are 
defaultrecorded
default as the Command and Control system ensures by default that the officers satisfactorily record an outcome to a police attendance/intervention. 
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default              
defaultI am slightly less confident that all police interventions are 
defaultcorrectly recorded as crimes
default. 
default 
defaultThis
default is for the following reasons:
default&#xa0;
default2.3.1
default              
defaultThe Command and Control system allows officers to record an incident as an anti-social behaviour incident as well as a crime. This is 
defaultpartly because of the confusing scenario where an incident could be classed as "both
default". This then potentially leads to the double counting of individual incidents as both ASB and crimes.
default2.3.2
default              
defaultI know from my experience as a Crime Manager supervising a Crime Management Centre that the only way to say you are 99% confident in your crime reco
defaultrding statistics is to have every crime checked by an 
defaultindependent scrutiniser. My Force does not do this, because of resource issues. I referred to this in my November submission. However, monthly audits are conducted which are overseen by the Deputy Chief
default Constable. 
default&#xa0;
default2.3.3
default              
defaultIn addition, t
defaulthe Force 
defaultCrime and Incident 
defaultRegistrar 
defaultcarries out
default spot checks, and the Force has recently changed procedures in the Force Control Room to ensure that logs are correctly filed with an outcome.
default&#xa0;
default2.3.4
default              
defaultTo achieve total indepe
defaultndent scrutiny of the crime recording system would mean increasing the Force Registrar team by three full time posts, amounting to a cost of roughly £100,000 pa, no mean feat in the current times of austerity. The Force and I are exploring this at the mome
defaultnt. 
default&#xa0;
default2.3.5
default              
defaultHowever, let us put this in context. The British Crime Survey and EU police crime statistics both show a reduction in crime. There is no doubt in my mind that crime is falling, although there is clear evidence that this fall is starting to leve
defaultl out. 
default&#xa0;
default2.3.6
default              
defaultOne cannot comment on crime recording without raising the unknown factor of non-reporting by the public. This factor must always be considered in the round. 
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default              
defaultIn summary, I would say that I am "reasonably confident" that I can trust the 
defaultcrime statistics in my area. However, as previously stated, one should never be complacent.
