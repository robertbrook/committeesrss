[[[Written evidence submitted by Scope]]]1.1.&#xa0; Scope remains concerned that the payment of the housing element of Universal Credit (UC) direct to tenants within their monthly payment will lead to increased arrears, and that changes to support for mortgage interest will equate to further cuts for disabled people.1.2.&#xa0; Impact assessments have shown that changes to the uprating of Housing Benefit (HB) will entail huge losses for disabled people1.3.&#xa0; Penalties for under-occupancy in the social rented sector will have a grave impact on disabled people who either require extra space for needs relating to their disability, or are unable to move house. 1.4.&#xa0; The cap on Annually Managed Expenditure (AME) will lead to inappropriate trade-offs between HB and disability benefits – meaning inevitable losses for disabled people.&#xa0;1.5.&#xa0; Scope recommends that the Government:1.4.1. Put in place proper provisions to ensure disabled people do not risk falling into arrears because of changes through UC1.4.2. Reconsider the zero-earnings rule, and make provisions in light of the barriers disabled people face in finding full-time employment.1.4.3. Make exemptions in regulations for disabled people living in specially adapted homes and those with legitimate reasons for being unable to move, or needing the extra space.1.4.4 Put in place clear safeguards for disability benefits within the AME cap, so that disabled people’s incomes will have some protection against wider trends in the economy.

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.1.&#xa0; We all want to live in a world of opportunity – to be able to live our own life, play our part and be valued for the person we are. At Scope we’re passionate about possibility.&#xa0; It inspires us every day and means we never set limits on people’s potential. We work with disabled people and their families at every stage of their lives.&#xa0; From offering day to day support and information, to challenging assumptions about disability and influencing decision makers – everything we do is about creating real and lasting change. We believe that a world where all disabled people have the same opportunities as everyone else would be a pretty incredible place for all of us. Together we can make it happen.2.2.&#xa0; For further information, please contact Ellie Brawn (Public Policy Advisor), on ellie.brawn@scope.org.uk.

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.1&#xa0; For most households, UC will be paid a single monthly payment, with the housing element being directly paid to tenants as part of it. We remain concerned that this will have huge implications for disabled people - partly because they have been in the dark about the changes affecting them (In 2012 almost half (45%) of all disabled people had never even heard of UC) – but largely because the change will affect the way those on extremely tight budgets will be required to manage their money. &#xa0;4.2&#xa0; The DWP has itself accepted that – even with the exceptions outlined in the Local Support Services framework  – the change from weekly to monthly welfare payments will increase the overall demand for advice.  4.3&#xa0; Housing associations have expressed concerns that tenants will use the housing element of their UC payment to meet more pressing financial needs, meaning they fall into arrears. Disabled people are experiencing considerable financial difficulties; Scope commissioned research showed that nearly half (49%) disabled people are relying on credit to pay for the basics in life such as clothing and food, and are three times as likely to turn to doorstep loans (10% compared to 3% non-disabled people). Disabled people are also more vulnerable to financial shocks- over a third (37%) say they could not afford an unexpected – but necessary – expense of £500, compared to a quarter of non-disabled people (26%). This problem is therefore likely to be more acute for disabled people. &#xa0;4.4&#xa0; The National Housing Federation believes that the removal of direct payment alone could see arrears rise by £320million across the sector – a 100% rise based on our estimates of total rent arrears (together with a further £100million of additional transaction costs).&#xa0;4.5&#xa0; 

[[[Recommendation:]]] Scope echoes the committee’s recommendation that the Government moves quickly to publish a clear&#xa0;definition of "vulnerable" groups within Universal Credit for whom it will not be appropriate to include housing costs in their benefit payment. It also needs to establish a robust process for proactively identifying claimants who are struggling to manage their housing costs so that they can be properly assisted before they fall into arrears and face eviction.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]5.1.&#xa0; Scope is concerned that the introduction of the zero-earnings rule for support for mortgage interest will disproportionately affect disabled people. The rule means that recipients will not receive any help with mortgage costs if they are doing any paid work, no matter how few hours. In their response, the Government writes that “having a mortgage to pay provides a strong incentive for moving into full-time employment” and that the rule will move people to “re-consider their position with regard to the amount of work they do or the level of their housing costs”.&#xa0;5.2.&#xa0; Disabled people are more likely to be working in low-paid, short-term and part-time jobs: The wage gap between disabled and non-disabled people remains higher than £1 an hour. Many disabled people want to work - 1 in 6 would like to work more hours compared with 1 in 10 non-disabled people- but face numerous barriers to the labour market. These barriers include housing; social care; other employment support; workplace culture such as employer perceptions; low confidence; difficulties accessing flexible working arrangements; fewer demonstrable skills, qualifications and experience than the wider population.&#xa0;5.3.&#xa0; But for those who face barriers to working more hours, or entering full time employment, the incentives for disabled people with a mortgage are redundant, and will simply mean more cuts to the support they receive.&#xa0;5.4.&#xa0; 

[[[Recommendation:]]] Scope urges the Government to reconsider the zero-earnings rule, and make provisions for the barriers disabled people face in finding full-time employment.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]6.1&#xa0; Scope remains deeply concerned that the size criteria in the social rented sector are disproportionately affecting disabled people. Since 1 April 2013, working age renters in the social sector have had their Housing Benefit (HB) reduced if judged to have a spare room. If they have 1 ‘spare’ room their HB is reduced by 14%, if they have two or more ‘spare’ rooms their HB is reduced by 25%. Tenants are faced with two choices – move to a smaller property or find a way to make up the shortfall. &#xa0;6.2&#xa0; The majority of those affected are disabled people. 660 000 people in total will be affected by the size criteria by 2015, losing between £624 and £1144 per year. 420 000 (63%) of those affected will be disabled people. &#xa0;6.3&#xa0; Many disabled people need an additional room for specialist equipment; or so that they can sleep separately from their partner.&#xa0;6.4&#xa0; On top of this, moving house is not an option for many disabled people. Some with mental health conditions find the thought of moving very distressing; those with certain physical impairments will find packing and moving house impossible, and hiring someone to help, too expensive.&#xa0;6.5&#xa0; Many disabled social housing tenants have been allocated their home on the basis of their needs, or have had adaptations made to improve accessibility. With a lack of alternative accessible housing available, these disabled people will be forced to pay more rent.&#xa0;6.6&#xa0; On 30th July 2013, in judicial reviews brought by ten households against the bedroom tax, the high courts acknowledged that the Government is discriminating against disabled people.&#xa0;6.7&#xa0; The DWP argues that the £25 million in Discretionary Housing Payment (DHP) would cover the loss in HB experienced by those in ‘exceptional circumstances’. There is a danger that this cash-limited pot simply will not go far enough to support all those that need it. Local Authorities will only be given a limited amount of money from which to make these payments, and so will have to make difficult decisions about who to provide with a DHP, and for how long.

[[[&#xa0;]]]6.8&#xa0; 

[[[Recommendation:]]] There should be an exemption in regulations on the size criteria for disabled people living in specially adapted homes and those with legitimate reasons for being unable to move. There should also be exemptions for disabled couples who cannot share a bedroom and storage for bulky medical equipment.&#xa0;7.1.&#xa0; Scope is extremely worried about the Chancellor’s announcement at the Spending Round that there will be a cap on the social security part of Annually Managed Expenditure - spending that the government has previously said could not be limited in advance, but now will be.&#xa0;7.2.&#xa0; State Pensions and JSA will be excluded from the cap, but disability benefits won’t be protected. Nor will HB which – like JSA - respond to changes in the economy. The impact of this is that disabled people are left exposed to trade-offs within the cap. So if one year the need for HB rises sharply, there is a real risk that disability benefits will be a lower spending priority. There is a substantial risk disabled people will lose out on vital financial lifelines.&#xa0;7.3.&#xa0; 

[[[Recommendation:]]] We therefore want to see clear safeguards for disability benefits within the cap, so that disabled people’s incomes will have some protection against wider trends in the economy.&#xa0;&#xa0;27 September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; February 2013, Universal Credit Local Support Services Framework, https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/181395/uc-local-service-support-framework.pdf February 2013, Universal Credit Local Support Services Framework, https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/181395/uc-local-service-support-framework.pdf Scope interview with representative from Affinity Sutton group Ltd, June 2013 Scope (2013) Disabled People and Financial Well-being: Credit and Debt, http://scopesblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/credit-and-debt1.pdf Scope (2013) Disabled People and Financial Well-being: Financial Situation, http://scopesblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/financial-situation1.pdf  National Housing Federation (2011) Briefing on welfare reform bill Berthoud R (2011) Trends in the Employment of Disabled People in Britain, Institute for Social and Economic Research Working Paper Series, 2011–03 Berthoud R (2011) Trends in the Employment of Disabled People in Britain, Institute for Social and Economic Research Working Paper Series, 2011–03 Labour Force Survey, 2012 Life Opportunities Survey, Wave One (2009/2011) Berthoud, R.
