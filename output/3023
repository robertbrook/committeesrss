default:

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.1
default              
defaultThe Public
default Inquiry fo
defaultr the A21 Tonbridge to Pembury d
defaultualling scheme was held between 14 May and 9 July 2013, the outcome of which is expected in late 2013 or early 2014. The Public Inquiry was due to be held three years earlier in July 2010, but was cancelled due to
default the 2010 Spending Review. If the Secretary of State rules in favour of the scheme it could be delivered in the next Spending Review Period, however, delivery is by no means certain, which is extremely disappointing given that this scheme is key to address
defaulting the transport challenges in 
defaultWest Kent
default. 
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default              
defaultCutting congestion and improving journey time reliability along the A21 corridor is a key element of KCC’s transport delivery plan 
defaultGrowth w
defaultithout Gridlock
default. T
defaulthe current Local Transpo
defaultrt Plan (2011-2016)
default refers
default to the economic harm that KCC believes has been caused by delay to the dualling of the A21 between Tonbridge and Pembury. 
defaultThe County Council recognises that this is a priority project for 
defaultKent
default, yet it has been delayed due to the weaknesses in how Governme
defaultnt plans, funds and delivers improvements to the Strategic Road Network.
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default              
defaultKCC has evidence that delivery by the Local Transport Authority, i.e. 
defaultKent County Council
default, would 
defaulthave 
defaultresult
defaulted
default in completion of the scheme at a lower cost. KCC is therefore advoc
defaultating that 
defaultthe reforms to the Highways Agency
default (HA)
default include provision for 
defaultfuture 
defaultscheme delivery by Local Transport Authorities
default,
default where it can be demonstrated that this would provide improved efficiency and value for money.
default  
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default              
defaultKCC
default conducted a 
defaultcost 
defaultreview of the A21 Tonbridge to Pembury dualling scheme which has led us to believe that it could have 
defaultbeen 
defaultdelivered
default for 
defaultaround 20% 
defaultless tha
defaultn the HA
default. This example 
defaulttherefore 
defaultdemonstrates how future 
defaultschemes cou
defaultld be delivered for
default lower cost by Local Transpor
defaultt Authorities
default.
default In

defaultKCC
default’s
default 
defaultreview
default 
defaultof 
defaultthe
default HA
default’s
default proposal
default for the A21 scheme
default (Option A)
default, we
default explored three alternative options; Options
default B, C and D with each having it
defaults own programme. 
defaultT
defaulthe 
defaultcost 
defaultdifferences between KCC’s
default Options
default B and C
default and the HA’s scheme 
defaultare primarily fees associated with the different statutory approval routes and inflation associated with the relative timescales. Our third option, D, 
defaultwould involve
default major chan
defaultges
default to the scheme and 
defaultit 
defaultwould need to be progressed
default through the
default National
defaultly
default Signi
defaultficant
default Infrastructure Projects (NSIP) process through the Planning Inspectorate.
default 
defaultT

defaultde-trunking the road to enable KCC to become the Highw
defaultay Authority and then deliver
default the scheme to benefit from exemption from VAT.
default KCC 
defaultdoes not pay VAT on its own highway schemes, but to achieve this, the A21 would need to be de-trunked. 
defaultDe-trun
defaultking could also be of benefit considering that many other ‘A’ roads that fulfil a similar func
defaulttion are successfully managed by the Local Transport Authority
default.

defaultThis option

defaults that

default that a number of design elements and concessions ma
defaultde by the HA
default are over generous.
default 
defaultOur provisional analysis shows that s
defaultubstantial savings 
defaultcould 
defaulthave 
defaultbe
defaulten
default made on a 
defaultnumber of fronts, including
default:
default tightening the design to keep
default more to the existing alignment;

defaultThese

defaultthat

default could have been made

default2.5
default              
defaultIn summary, KCC has identified overall cost savings on 
defaultthe HA scheme through a review of:
default&#xa0;
defaultKCC can p
defaultrovide more in depth evidence to support the above if required.
default              
default2.6
default              
defaultThe example o
defaultf the A21 Tonbridge to Pembury dualling s
defaultcheme demonstrates t
defaulthe way in which t
defaulthe 
defaultwork of the 
defaultHA 
defaulthas 
defaultled
default to increased cost estimates
default. This
default 
defaultresult
defaults
default in poor financial managemen
defaultt
default and a high risk of non-delivery. Without KCC challenging the HA on their costs, we believe that the A21 Tonbridge to Pembury dualling scheme would not still be a live scheme today
default. A new way forward is needed for all future high capital cost projects
default. Th
defaultere is now the opportunity with the Government’s proposed reforms of the HA and the management of the Strategic Road Network to allow Local Transport Autho
defaultrities to deliver
default major road schemes
default.
default KCC believes this will result in greater efficiencies, value fo
defaultr money and delivery of more schemes that are vital for economic growth.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.1
default              
defaultThe Department for Transport (DfT) Circular 02/2013 ‘The Strategic Road Network and the Delivery of Sustainable Development’ section 40 states that 
default“where the strategic growth test cannot be met there will be no additional junctions with, or direct means o
defaultf access to, motorways and other routes of motorway standard other than for the provision of signed roadside facilities for road users, maintenance compounds and, exceptionally, major transport interchanges.”
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default              
defaultThis policy prevents the construction of 
defaulta new Junction 5a on the M2 which would provide the 
defaultKent
default 
defaultScience
default 
defaultPark
default with direct motorway access and open up the area for further employment. Although Section 39 of Circular 02/2013 states that 
default“where appropriate, proposals for the creation of new junctio
defaultns or direct means of access may be identified and developed at the Plan-making stage in circumstances where it can be established that such new infrastructure is essential for the delivery of strategic planned growth”
default; the Local Planning Authority has not
default been able to include the Kent Science Park as a strategic site due to the uncertainty of being able to deliver the new motorway junction and a full link road to the A2, which current policy interpretation would require. 
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default              
defaultThe risk to the Local Plannin
defaultg Authority of including this as a strategic site to enable a new motorway junction would be that their Local Plan is found unsound on the basis that the considerable cost of the motorway junction and link road is unlikely to come forward in the plan perio
defaultd. A relaxation of this policy however, would enable construction of a partial junction and a slip road.  
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default              
defaultKCC therefore advocates that policies concerning new junctions on the Strategic Road Network are relaxed to allow the delivery of schemes that w
defaultould stimulate development, e
defaultconomic growth and job creation;
default thus 
defaultallow
defaulting
default the Strategic Road Network to
default play its full part in
default support
defaulting
default regeneration and economic prosperity.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4
default.1
default              
defaultThe example of the proposed new Lower Thames Crossing, the corridor options of which were recently consulted on by the DfT, demonstrates how investment in strategic roads could be increased through attracting new invest
defaultors. 
defaultKCC has held extensive discussions with North American private sector
default 
defaultinvestors who regularly finance large scale tolled roads projects and are keen
default 
defaultto be involved in the delivery a new 
defaultLower Thames
default crossing. They firmly hold
default the view that this 
defaultscheme
default could be delivered at no cost to the public purse and
default 
defaultare hungry for such opportunities.
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default              
defaultInitial discussions with North American private sector investors indicated that they would want
default a realist
defaultic assessment of what is achievable in terms of finances
default; and the
default structure 
defaultof 
defaulta 
defaultscheme delivery deal needs to
default ma
defaultrketable to the private sector. A 25 year concession is
default too short and would almost certainly require re-financing, as would a 30 year concession. A 50 year concession was preferred. 
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default              
defaultIt is vital that 
defaultthe 
defaultnew and existing crossings are linked as the
default existing toll inco
defaultme would
default be required to finance the debt
default incurred from construction of the new crossing
default. 
defaultThe p
defaultrivate sector would want flexibility to increase tolls, possibly by inflation 
defaultto achieve a minimum coverage ratio of debt. Their preference would be for toll increases to be determined independ
defaultent of Government in order to remove political interference.
default Surety of costs is vital for private financiers
default, as 
defaultwithout that, the risks make
default a pr
defaultoposal very difficult. However, a new 
defaultLower Thames
default 
defaultcrossing 
defaultguarantees investors
default a rate of 
defaultreturn from day one of opening
default.
default 
defaultTo give greater guarantee of cash flow in the first 5 years, it was advised that inflation
default +2% would be preferred due to the usu
defaultal tight
default margins 
defaultand to allow for mitigation of risk. 
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default              
defaultKCC spoke to one particular infrastructure investor, a world leader
default in developing infrastructure
default investment
default as an asset cl
defaultass for institutional investors, who have
default a proven track record in identif
defaultying, investing and managing infrastructure in
defaultvestments around the world
default.
default They see a new Lower Thames C
defaultrossing as similar to the 
defaultGolden
default 
defaultEars
default 
defaultBridge
default 
defaultacross the 
defaultFraser
default 
defaultRiver
default in 
defaultVancouver
default, 
defaultCanada
default,
default which opened in 2009 at a cost of $808 million (£509 m). It is
default an all-electronic tolled highway with 2011 toll revenue amounting to $38 million (£23.94 m). It is financed by a 35 year concession.
default&#xa0;
default4.5
default              
defaultThis investor indicated
default that 
defaultthey would expect the price of equity to be between 8-9
default% without construction risk; 11-1
default7% with construction risk; 11-14% with toll risk (where the private sector takes the traffic volume risk and not the Government). 
defaultIn order 
defaultto make the debt financing work, an ‘availability payment’ would reduce the toll risk and therefore the cost of equit
defaulty. The Government would keep all toll income and guarantee the private funders a minimum revenue return.
default 
defaultThey stressed that as the principle of tolling the Thames at this location
default (outer 
defaultLondon
default) had been established, a
default dual crossing network would be very a
defaultttractive to investors and this would reduce the cost of the equity. A crossing located away from the existing location
default (Dartford-Thurrock)
default would be preferred by investors to maximise future growth opportunity and ensure network resilience (and hence reven
defaultue streams).
default The c
defaultoncession would need tolling flexibility and 50 year duration, with potential for re-financing. 
default&#xa0;
default4.6
default              
defaultThey
default also 
defaultsuggested 
defaultbuilding in performance measures based around journey time reliability, user satisfaction, safety, etc
default,
default into concession arrangements.
default T
defaulthey
default indicated that
default there would be no dramatic difference between a tunnel and a bridge in terms of debt finance. Whilst the risks associated with tunnelling are higher than for a bridge they are not significant. The geotechn
defaultical data is essential to mitigating these. Once all
default risks are known an advisor would
default help structure the deal.
default 
defaultLong term revenue 
defaultincome is essential to fu
defaultnding infrastructure investment; although immediate yield is also important, i.e. revenue from existin
defaultg tolling.
default&#xa0;
default4.7
default              
defaultThe KCC experience with the North American investment sector clearly demonstrates how investment in strategic roads could be achieved through attracting overseas private sector investors for toll road schemes such as a new river crossing, a
defaultnd thus deliver vital national road infrastructure without the need for public funding. KCC strongly advocates that the Government takes a proactive roll in entering into negotiations with private sector investors to fund large scale projects essential to 
defaultthe future growth of the 
defaultUK
default economy.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5
default.1
default              
defaultKCC has made the case that t
defaulthe over estimation of costs by the Highways Agency for delivery of major road projects, as demonstrated by the A21 Tonbridge to Pembury dualling scheme, affects affordability, value for money, and risks scheme delivery. 
defaultKCC advocates that 
defaultfuture 
defaults
defaultchemes 
defaulton
default the Strategic Road 
defaultNetwork 
defaultcould be delivered more efficiently and cost effectively by Local Transport Authorities. 
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default              
defaultKCC has illustrated how p
defaultolicies 
defaultthat govern
default the Strategic Road Network are preventing the delivery of schemes that would otherwise s
defaulttimulate development, economic growth and job creation, as demonstrated by the inability to deliver a new 
defaultJunction 5a on the M20 to access
default 
defaultthe 
defaultKent
default 
defaultScience
default 
defaultPark
default. 
defaultKCC advocates that t
defaulthere needs to be greater flexibility to allow the Strategic Road Network t
defaulto support regeneration and economic prosperity.
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default              
defaultKCC has provided e
defaultxamples of North Ameri
defaultcan investors,
default interest
defaulted
default in constructing and operating a new Low
defaulter Thames Crossing, to
default 
defaultshow 
defaulthow private sector investment in the

defaultdeliver schemes that improve the Strategic Road Network
default and deliver economic growth
default.
default&#xa0;

default.4
default              
defaultKent County Council
default therefore recommends to the committee that action is taken by the Government 
defaultto allow local 
defaultdelivery of major road schemes; 
defaultprovide greater flexib
defaultility in current policy govern
defaulting Highways Agency procedures; and
