[normal]              
[normal]Kent County Council
[normal] (KCC)
[normal], as the Local Transport Authority for 
[normal]Kent
[normal],
[normal] welcomes the opportunity to s
[normal]ubmit written 
[normal]evidence to this i
[normal]nquiry
[normal] on the Strategic Road Network
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]We would be very happy to expand on any aspect either in writing or as oral evidence. 
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]              
[normal]In making this response KCC wishes to express its full endorsement of the response made to this Committee by 
[normal]the South East Local Transport Board (SELTB
[normal]).
[normal] 
[normal]Medway Council 
[normal]and East Sussex County Council 
[normal]also fully support
[normal] this submission.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3  
[normal]              
[normal]KCC’s subm
[normal]ission 
[normal]of evidence can be summarised as follows:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4
[normal]              
[normal]Kent County Council
[normal] recommends to the committee that action is taken by the Government
[normal] to
[normal]:
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]              
[normal]The Public
[normal] Inquiry fo
[normal]r the A21 Tonbridge to Pembury d
[normal]ualling scheme was held between 14 May and 9 July 2013, the outcome of which is expected in late 2013 or early 2014. The Public Inquiry was due to be held three years earlier in July 2010, but was cancelled due to
[normal] the 2010 Spending Review. If the Secretary of State rules in favour of the scheme it could be delivered in the next Spending Review Period, however, delivery is by no means certain, which is extremely disappointing given that this scheme is key to address
[normal]ing the transport challenges in 
[normal]West Kent
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]              
[normal]Cutting congestion and improving journey time reliability along the A21 corridor is a key element of KCC’s transport delivery plan 
[normal]Growth w
[normal]ithout Gridlock
[normal]. T
[normal]he current Local Transpo
[normal]rt Plan (2011-2016)
[normal] refers
[normal] to the economic harm that KCC believes has been caused by delay to the dualling of the A21 between Tonbridge and Pembury. 
[normal]The County Council recognises that this is a priority project for 
[normal]Kent
[normal], yet it has been delayed due to the weaknesses in how Governme
[normal]nt plans, funds and delivers improvements to the Strategic Road Network.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]              
[normal]KCC has evidence that delivery by the Local Transport Authority, i.e. 
[normal]Kent County Council
[normal], would 
[normal]have 
[normal]result
[normal]ed
[normal] in completion of the scheme at a lower cost. KCC is therefore advoc
[normal]ating that 
[normal]the reforms to the Highways Agency
[normal] (HA)
[normal] include provision for 
[normal]future 
[normal]scheme delivery by Local Transport Authorities
[normal],
[normal] where it can be demonstrated that this would provide improved efficiency and value for money.
[normal]  
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal]              
[normal]KCC
[normal] conducted a 
[normal]cost 
[normal]review of the A21 Tonbridge to Pembury dualling scheme which has led us to believe that it could have 
[normal]been 
[normal]delivered
[normal] for 
[normal]around 20% 
[normal]less tha
[normal]n the HA
[normal]. This example 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]demonstrates how future 
[normal]schemes cou
[normal]ld be delivered for
[normal] lower cost by Local Transpor
[normal]t Authorities
[normal].
[normal] In
[normal] 
[normal]KCC
[normal]’s
[normal] 
[normal]review
[normal] 
[normal]of 
[normal]the
[normal] HA
[normal]’s
[normal] proposal
[normal] for the A21 scheme
[normal] (Option A)
[normal], we
[normal] explored three alternative options; Options
[normal] B, C and D with each having it
[normal]s own programme. 
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]cost 
[normal]differences between KCC’s
[normal] Options
[normal] B and C
[normal] and the HA’s scheme 
[normal]are primarily fees associated with the different statutory approval routes and inflation associated with the relative timescales. Our third option, D, 
[normal]would involve
[normal] major chan
[normal]ges
[normal] to the scheme and 
[normal]it 
[normal]would need to be progressed
[normal] through the
[normal] National
[normal]ly
[normal] Signi
[normal]ficant
[normal] Infrastructure Projects (NSIP) process through the Planning Inspectorate.
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he alternative options are 
[normal]summarised 
[normal]as follows:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]•
[normal]              
[normal]Option B 
[normal]would 
[normal]have 
[normal]involve
[normal]d
[normal] m
[normal]inor changes to 
[normal]the 
[normal]HA scheme
[normal] 
[normal]and
[normal] 
[normal]assumed
[normal] that
[normal] KCC 
[normal]could 
[normal]have 
[normal]deliver
[normal]ed
[normal] the scheme as agent to the HA under a Section 6 Agreement.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]•
[normal]              
[normal]Option C 
[normal]also 
[normal]involved
[normal] 
[normal]m
[normal]inor changes to 
[normal]the 
[normal]HA scheme
[normal] 
[normal]with additionally
[normal] 
[normal]de-trunking the road to enable KCC to become the Highw
[normal]ay Authority and then deliver
[normal] the scheme to benefit from exemption from VAT.
[normal] KCC 
[normal]does not pay VAT on its own highway schemes, but to achieve this, the A21 would need to be de-trunked. 
[normal]De-trun
[normal]king could also be of benefit considering that many other ‘A’ roads that fulfil a similar func
[normal]tion are successfully managed by the Local Transport Authority
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]•
[normal]              
[normal]Option D
[normal] 
[normal]would 
[normal]have 
[normal]involve
[normal]d
[normal] a c
[normal]ompletely fresh start, comprising 
[normal]fundamental design changes
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]the 
[normal]de-trunking of the A21
[normal], with the transfer of
[normal] management 
[normal]responsibility to 
[normal]the Local 
[normal]Transport Authority.
[normal] 
[normal]The 
[normal]scheme would 
[normal]also 
[normal]have 
[normal]need
[normal]ed
[normal] to be progressed
[normal] through the 
[normal]NSIP process
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]This option
[normal] demonstrate
[normal]s that
[normal] significant cost sav
[normal]ings could have
[normal] be
[normal]en
[normal] made. Our review showed
[normal] that a number of design elements and concessions ma
[normal]de by the HA
[normal] are over generous.
[normal] 
[normal]Our provisional analysis shows that s
[normal]ubstantial savings 
[normal]could 
[normal]have 
[normal]be
[normal]en
[normal] made on a 
[normal]number of fronts, including
[normal]:
[normal] tightening the design to keep
[normal] more to the existing alignment;
[normal] usi
[normal]ng more of the existing highway; woodland replacement; earth
[normal]works;
[normal] 
[normal]footwa
[normal]y and side-road provision. 
[normal]These 
[normal]savings 
[normal]would 
[normal]have 
[normal]need
[normal]ed
[normal] to be fully developed at detailed design stage but suggest 
[normal]that 
[normal]potential savings
[normal] could have been made
[normal] on 
[normal]the HA’s scheme
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5
[normal]              
[normal]In summary, KCC has identified overall cost savings on 
[normal]the HA scheme through a review of:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]KCC can p
[normal]rovide more in depth evidence to support the above if required.
[normal]              
[normal]2.6
[normal]              
[normal]The example o
[normal]f the A21 Tonbridge to Pembury dualling s
[normal]cheme demonstrates t
[normal]he way in which t
[normal]he 
[normal]work of the 
[normal]HA 
[normal]has 
[normal]led
[normal] to increased cost estimates
[normal]. This
[normal] 
[normal]result
[normal]s
[normal] in poor financial managemen
[normal]t
[normal] and a high risk of non-delivery. Without KCC challenging the HA on their costs, we believe that the A21 Tonbridge to Pembury dualling scheme would not still be a live scheme today
[normal]. A new way forward is needed for all future high capital cost projects
[normal]. Th
[normal]ere is now the opportunity with the Government’s proposed reforms of the HA and the management of the Strategic Road Network to allow Local Transport Autho
[normal]rities to deliver
[normal] major road schemes
[normal].
[normal] KCC believes this will result in greater efficiencies, value fo
[normal]r money and delivery of more schemes that are vital for economic growth.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]The Department for Transport (DfT) Circular 02/2013 ‘The Strategic Road Network and the Delivery of Sustainable Development’ section 40 states that 
[normal]“where the strategic growth test cannot be met there will be no additional junctions with, or direct means o
[normal]f access to, motorways and other routes of motorway standard other than for the provision of signed roadside facilities for road users, maintenance compounds and, exceptionally, major transport interchanges.”
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]              
[normal]This policy prevents the construction of 
[normal]a new Junction 5a on the M2 which would provide the 
[normal]Kent
[normal] 
[normal]Science
[normal] 
[normal]Park
[normal] with direct motorway access and open up the area for further employment. Although Section 39 of Circular 02/2013 states that 
[normal]“where appropriate, proposals for the creation of new junctio
[normal]ns or direct means of access may be identified and developed at the Plan-making stage in circumstances where it can be established that such new infrastructure is essential for the delivery of strategic planned growth”
[normal]; the Local Planning Authority has not
[normal] been able to include the Kent Science Park as a strategic site due to the uncertainty of being able to deliver the new motorway junction and a full link road to the A2, which current policy interpretation would require. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]              
[normal]The risk to the Local Plannin
[normal]g Authority of including this as a strategic site to enable a new motorway junction would be that their Local Plan is found unsound on the basis that the considerable cost of the motorway junction and link road is unlikely to come forward in the plan perio
[normal]d. A relaxation of this policy however, would enable construction of a partial junction and a slip road.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4
[normal]              
[normal]KCC therefore advocates that policies concerning new junctions on the Strategic Road Network are relaxed to allow the delivery of schemes that w
[normal]ould stimulate development, e
[normal]conomic growth and job creation;
[normal] thus 
[normal]allow
[normal]ing
[normal] the Strategic Road Network to
[normal] play its full part in
[normal] support
[normal]ing
[normal] regeneration and economic prosperity.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].1
[normal]              
[normal]The example of the proposed new Lower Thames Crossing, the corridor options of which were recently consulted on by the DfT, demonstrates how investment in strategic roads could be increased through attracting new invest
[normal]ors. 
[normal]KCC has held extensive discussions with North American private sector
[normal] 
[normal]investors who regularly finance large scale tolled roads projects and are keen
[normal] 
[normal]to be involved in the delivery a new 
[normal]Lower Thames
[normal] crossing. They firmly hold
[normal] the view that this 
[normal]scheme
[normal] could be delivered at no cost to the public purse and
[normal] 
[normal]are hungry for such opportunities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]              
[normal]Initial discussions with North American private sector investors indicated that they would want
[normal] a realist
[normal]ic assessment of what is achievable in terms of finances
[normal]; and the
[normal] structure 
[normal]of 
[normal]a 
[normal]scheme delivery deal needs to
[normal] ma
[normal]rketable to the private sector. A 25 year concession is
[normal] too short and would almost certainly require re-financing, as would a 30 year concession. A 50 year concession was preferred. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3
[normal]              
[normal]It is vital that 
[normal]the 
[normal]new and existing crossings are linked as the
[normal] existing toll inco
[normal]me would
[normal] be required to finance the debt
[normal] incurred from construction of the new crossing
[normal]. 
[normal]The p
[normal]rivate sector would want flexibility to increase tolls, possibly by inflation 
[normal]to achieve a minimum coverage ratio of debt. Their preference would be for toll increases to be determined independ
[normal]ent of Government in order to remove political interference.
[normal] Surety of costs is vital for private financiers
[normal], as 
[normal]without that, the risks make
[normal] a pr
[normal]oposal very difficult. However, a new 
[normal]Lower Thames
[normal] 
[normal]crossing 
[normal]guarantees investors
[normal] a rate of 
[normal]return from day one of opening
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]To give greater guarantee of cash flow in the first 5 years, it was advised that inflation
[normal] +2% would be preferred due to the usu
[normal]al tight
[normal] margins 
[normal]and to allow for mitigation of risk. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4
[normal]              
[normal]KCC spoke to one particular infrastructure investor, a world leader
[normal] in developing infrastructure
[normal] investment
[normal] as an asset cl
[normal]ass for institutional investors, who have
[normal] a proven track record in identif
[normal]ying, investing and managing infrastructure in
[normal]vestments around the world
[normal].
[normal] They see a new Lower Thames C
[normal]rossing as similar to the 
[normal]Golden
[normal] 
[normal]Ears
[normal] 
[normal]Bridge
[normal] 
[normal]across the 
[normal]Fraser
[normal] 
[normal]River
[normal] in 
[normal]Vancouver
[normal], 
[normal]Canada
[normal],
[normal] which opened in 2009 at a cost of $808 million (£509 m). It is
[normal] an all-electronic tolled highway with 2011 toll revenue amounting to $38 million (£23.94 m). It is financed by a 35 year concession.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5
[normal]              
[normal]This investor indicated
[normal] that 
[normal]they would expect the price of equity to be between 8-9
[normal]% without construction risk; 11-1
[normal]7% with construction risk; 11-14% with toll risk (where the private sector takes the traffic volume risk and not the Government). 
[normal]In order 
[normal]to make the debt financing work, an ‘availability payment’ would reduce the toll risk and therefore the cost of equit
[normal]y. The Government would keep all toll income and guarantee the private funders a minimum revenue return.
[normal] 
[normal]They stressed that as the principle of tolling the Thames at this location
[normal] (outer 
[normal]London
[normal]) had been established, a
[normal] dual crossing network would be very a
[normal]ttractive to investors and this would reduce the cost of the equity. A crossing located away from the existing location
[normal] (Dartford-Thurrock)
[normal] would be preferred by investors to maximise future growth opportunity and ensure network resilience (and hence reven
[normal]ue streams).
[normal] The c
[normal]oncession would need tolling flexibility and 50 year duration, with potential for re-financing. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.6
[normal]              
[normal]They
[normal] also 
[normal]suggested 
[normal]building in performance measures based around journey time reliability, user satisfaction, safety, etc
[normal],
[normal] into concession arrangements.
[normal] T
[normal]hey
[normal] indicated that
[normal] there would be no dramatic difference between a tunnel and a bridge in terms of debt finance. Whilst the risks associated with tunnelling are higher than for a bridge they are not significant. The geotechn
[normal]ical data is essential to mitigating these. Once all
[normal] risks are known an advisor would
[normal] help structure the deal.
[normal] 
[normal]Long term revenue 
[normal]income is essential to fu
[normal]nding infrastructure investment; although immediate yield is also important, i.e. revenue from existin
[normal]g tolling.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.7
[normal]              
[normal]The KCC experience with the North American investment sector clearly demonstrates how investment in strategic roads could be achieved through attracting overseas private sector investors for toll road schemes such as a new river crossing, a
[normal]nd thus deliver vital national road infrastructure without the need for public funding. KCC strongly advocates that the Government takes a proactive roll in entering into negotiations with private sector investors to fund large scale projects essential to 
[normal]the future growth of the 
[normal]UK
[normal] economy.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal].1
[normal]              
[normal]KCC has made the case that t
[normal]he over estimation of costs by the Highways Agency for delivery of major road projects, as demonstrated by the A21 Tonbridge to Pembury dualling scheme, affects affordability, value for money, and risks scheme delivery. 
[normal]KCC advocates that 
[normal]future 
[normal]s
[normal]chemes 
[normal]on
[normal] the Strategic Road 
[normal]Network 
[normal]could be delivered more efficiently and cost effectively by Local Transport Authorities. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal]              
[normal]KCC has illustrated how p
[normal]olicies 
[normal]that govern
[normal] the Strategic Road Network are preventing the delivery of schemes that would otherwise s
[normal]timulate development, economic growth and job creation, as demonstrated by the inability to deliver a new 
[normal]Junction 5a on the M20 to access
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]Kent
[normal] 
[normal]Science
[normal] 
[normal]Park
[normal]. 
[normal]KCC advocates that t
[normal]here needs to be greater flexibility to allow the Strategic Road Network t
[normal]o support regeneration and economic prosperity.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3
[normal]              
[normal]KCC has provided e
[normal]xamples of North Ameri
[normal]can investors,
[normal] interest
[normal]ed
[normal] in constructing and operating a new Low
[normal]er Thames Crossing, to
[normal] 
[normal]show 
[normal]how private sector investment in the 
[normal]UK
[normal]’s strategic roads could 
[normal]deliver schemes that improve the Strategic Road Network
[normal] and deliver economic growth
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal].4
[normal]              
[normal]Kent County Council
[normal] therefore recommends to the committee that action is taken by the Government 
[normal]to allow local 
[normal]delivery of major road schemes; 
[normal]provide greater flexib
[normal]ility in current policy govern
[normal]ing Highways Agency procedures; and
[normal] take a more proactive approach to attract private sector funding 
[normal]to deliver schemes that improve
[normal] the Strategic Road Network.
