"&#xa0;\nSupplementary written evidence submitted by Calor Gas Ltd (HOT0061)&#xa0;Firstly\n,\n I\n would\n like to thank the Committee for the opportunity to provide oral evidence yesterday as part of your inquiry into heat.\n&#xa0;\nDuring the two evidence sessions a considerable amount of attention was given to the poor operating performance of heat pumps – particul\narly air source heat pumps (ASHPs) – in a number of independent field trials. We had raised this issue as part of our evidence and as such we thought the Committee might find it useful to have a more detailed summary of how poorly ASHPs have performed \nacro\nss these trials. \n&#xa0;\nWe have of course raised the question as to whether ASHPs should qualify for tax payer funded subsidy given that their performance in closely monitored trials over long periods has repeatedly failed to meet the requirements of the Renewa\nble Energy Directive\n meaning the energy they generate could not be counted towards the UK’s renewable targets\n. This is not withstanding the claims of at least one manufacturer that \nthe technology is so good it doesn’t need a subsidy to make it economically attractive for consumers – quoting a 17% annual return on investment in the process.\n&#xa0;\nHowever, we have a bigger concern based around consumer protection. We have already had cause to complain to the ASA regarding the sales literatu\nre of one ASHP installer\n and the ASA forced the company in question to amend their literature as a result. W\ne\n are aware of at least one other successful ASA complaint in this area.\n&#xa0;\nOur understanding is that many companies have plans in place to offer free\n of charge ASHP installations along the lines of the “rent-a-roof” model that was prevalent when solar PV subsidies were launched. In the case of solar PV the householder was offered free solar panels on the basis that they would get the benefit of any “fr\nee” electricity produced whilst the investing company was able to claim the Feed in Tariffs (\nFiTs\n) for each kW of metered generation. As such it was possible to see this as a guaranteed “win-win” for each party.\n&#xa0;\nHowever, in the case of ASHPs the picture is not so clear cut – for the householder at least. \nThis is because ASHPs could be offered on a free of charge basis to households who might otherwise be able to afford the normal capital costs associated with the \ninstallation of an ASHP system. This will be particularly true of households containing vulnerable people who might already be in fuel poverty. They will get a free system and the investing company will get a \nguaranteed\n rate of investment return for the 7 \nyears that they are able to claim the RHI on the basis of the free/subsidised installation. It is important to note that the return is \nguaranteed\n as RHI payments are made on a deemed rather than a metered basis.\n As such the bulk of the risk sits fairly and\n squarely with the consumer as they will have the gamble as \nto whether the ASHP system will deliver what it says on the tin. Much of the evidence to date, which is detailed in the enclosed analysis, shows that the odds are not great:\nIt should be noted that EST Phase 2 only achieved th\ne higher\n level after 3 years and \nafter \nmajor rectification wor\nk being carried out\n in a large proportion  of cases\n – including completely new systems.\n&#xa0;\nThis represents a real and present threat\n as ASHPs which fail to perform will leave\n vulnerable consumers struggling to pay \npotentially \nastronimical\n energy bills. If th\ne Committee wants to see the damaging impact this can have we would urge you to watch the latest \nBBC1 \nRip Off \nBritain programme which was broadcast on 17\nth\n September 2013 and shows the misery which is being heaped upon \nvulnerable \nhouseholds right across \nBritain:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlJLxMcF0V4\n&#xa0;\nThe scandal here is that DECC is currently sitting on the performance data for over 4200 ASHPs which it has obtained via its monitoring of the R\nenewable Heat Premium Payment Programme (RHPP) since August 2011. This data was to have been published over the summer, but has been deemed “too complex” to publish. \nNevertheless, \nwe are aware \nthrough oral evidence given to the Committee on Tuesday \nthat th\ne data is being shared with the industry who believe it is “encouraging” – not exactly a ringing endorsement.\n It might be of benefit to Members if the Committee were minded to obtain this information from Mr Davidson, because it is not available publicly n\nor to MPs and Peers that have asked for it.\n&#xa0;\nCalor\n believes that ASHPs will have a part to play in decarbonising \nBritain\n’s heat demand. However, there is clear evidence that the technology is not yet ready for widespread deployment and does not provide suf\nficient protection for either the tax payer or end user for it to justify significant subsidy at this stage.\n&#xa0;\nIn the meantime the Committee may want to look at and encourage more certain methods\n \nof reducing carbon emissions and \nlowering \npeoples’ energy bil\nls\n, which also offer much better value for money\n. A\n prime example of this was the Boiler \nScrappage\n S\ncheme which operated \nduring\n the second quarter of 2010. \nThis provided a\n £50 million fund \nthat \nallowed the early replacement of 125,000 F and G rated old central heating boilers. \nOver 60% of the boilers currently in peoples’ homes fall into this category of inefficient boilers. The policy \nbenefitted \nthe \nconsumers\n who brought forward the changing of \ntheir old boiler\n as they would have seen an immediate, \ntypically 25% or more, reduction in their energy consumption. Moreover \nthe \nboiler \nscrappage\n scheme gave a boost to \nthe substantial \nBritish \nboiler \nmanufacturing \nindustry \nand the order books of \nheating\n i\nnstallers.\n&#xa0;\nCalor\n has seen the impact of th\nis\n polic\ny\n, combined with other factors (better insulation, higher energy costs, recession), on energy consumption. In the past 10 years our average central heating customer has reduced their fuel usage by over 20%\n on a weather adjusted basis. The same has happened to natural gas demand in urban areas and we believe this decline is set to continue.\n&#xa0;\nWhy AIR SOURCE HEAT PUMPS (ASHPs) should not receive the RHI&#xa0;EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#xa0;&#xa0;CONCLUSION: ASHPs are currently a failed technology and should be deprived of taxpayer subsidy.&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSubsidy to heat pumps is also set to surge&#xa0;\nSubsidy is currently provided to householders who install an air source heat pump \n(ASHP) at the rate of £850 per installation; and at a rate of £1,250 for householders who install a ground source heat pump (GSHP). Renewable Heat Incentive payments for operating these systems are scheduled for introduction in domestic premises from next \nyear at an indicative rate of 6.9-11.5p/KWh for ASHPs and of 12.5-17.3p/KWh for GSHPs.\n&#xa0;\nLeading pump manufacturer claims subsidy unnecessary&#xa0;\nhttp://www.ecovisionsystems.co.uk/heat-pumps/air-source-heat-pumps/Air-Source-Heat-Pumps-Without-the-RHI.html\n (Appendix 1)\n&#xa0;\nDimplex\n makes ASHP\ns and according to \na\n blog\n written by its Business Development Director\n, the RHI is a waste of taxpayers’ money: “…With oil prices continuing to rise, increasingly the financial argument for upgrading to air source heat pumps actually already stands firmly \non its own two feet without the need for a motivational incentive…. actually for homeowners heating their property with oil or LPG, then the savings and benefits over their existing system should already be significantly attractive enough to make the upgra\nde very worthwhile anyway….Recent analysis we've carried out shows the \"payback\" on installing an air source heat pump in an existing property can now be as little as 6 years - and that's without taking into account any possible future RHI income or increa\nses in oil prices!”\n&#xa0;\nDimpl\nex\n \ncalculates\n \nthey can generate a 17% annual return on investment. In fact if you then add on the RHI at £500/year (DECC\n&#xa0;\nnumbers) the return leaps to over 27%\n.\n \nDimplex\n concludes:\n \n“It's clear then that in the right circumstances householders don't need the RHI to make installing air source heat pumps stack up”. Why then is the Treasury being so generous with taxpayer resources? \nT\nhere are numerous \nadditional \nreasons\n why subsidising \nA\nSHPs\n is very bad value for money.\n&#xa0;\nToo often, ASHPs when installed fail to deliver value for money and fail to qualify as renewable&#xa0;\nDECC is well aware \nthat the performance of heat pumps is disappointing\n: “We are aware that systems installed in the past \nhave not always worked as well as they should… We think it is likely that on average the results will still be a long way off the high-performing systems that are consistently being measured in Germany,” (\nParas\n. 199 &amp; 201, DECC Consultation on the RHI, 20.\n9.12) and again\n: “It is a common feature in field trials and assessments that there is a significant gap between expected and actual performance” (\npara\n. 1.23, \nMicrogeneration\n Strategy \nConsultation, DECC, 22.12.10). This frank admission is echoed by the Gre\nen Alliance – “Heat pumps have performed badly in the UK…UK heat pumps have suffered from poor quality technology…bad installation…incorrect use…high running costs…Despite poor installations, heat pump installers aren’t being struck off for malpractice (“S\nwitching the UK onto heat pumps”, 29\nth\n May 2013)”.  \nThe Zero Carbon Hub identifies heat pumps as demonstrating a performance gap between stated and actual installed building performance: “There are concerns regarding the level of both installation and comm\nissioning skills for building services, especially mechanical ventilation and heat pumps as demonstrated by GHA research, Zero Carbon Hub’s Ventilation and Indoor Air Quality reports and EST field trial,” (\n“Closing the Gap Between Design and As-Built Perfo\nrmance”, \np5, May 2013).\n&#xa0;\nThe key to whether heat pumps deliver value for money or not is the\nir\n Coefficient of Per\nformance (\nCoP\n)\n. Heat pumps extract heat from the ground or air and redirect the heat for space heating and hot water. \nCoPs\n represent the ratio of heat produced per unit of electricity consumed in generating that heat. A \nCoP\n of 3 means that 3kWh of heat are output for 1k\nWh of electricity used to run the pump. Higher \nCoP\n values represent relatively more efficient heat delivery. \nUnder an EU Directive, h\neat pumps must achieve a \nCoP\n of 2.9 before their energy can contribute to the renewable energy target. \n&#xa0;\nA study of install\ned heat pump performance published by the Energy Saving Trust on the 8\nth\n September 2010 – “\nGetting Warmer: a field trial of heat pumps”\n revealed that the actual performance of heat pumps installed in the UK was surprisingly poor. The study was financed by \nthe heat pump industry and based on a sample of sites where pumps had been installed pre-selected by the industry. The pumps were installed and accredited through the \nMicrogeneration\n Certification Scheme’s immediate predecessor, the Clear Skies programme. \nThe study showed that only 1 of the 22 properties\n with GSHPs\n achieved th\ne 2.9 threshold\n, and only 9 of the 47 sites with ASHPs achieved the standard. REF commented on this report: “\nThe risk of premature adoption and consumer disenchantment is clearly real,\n thus raising the spectre of a \nUK\n heat pump tragedy… On the basis of this study, there seems a distinct risk that some heat pumps will be subsidised even though they fail to meet the minimum standard for being considered a renewable energy source. If, on t\nhe other hand, government withdraws subsidies from such installations, well-meaning householders may discover after investing heavily in a heat pump that their installations fail to come up to the required EU standard, and thus forfeit entitlement to RHI p\nayments” (“Renewable Heat Initiative”, September 2010).\n&#xa0;\nA \nJoseph \nRowntree\n Foundation study in Elm Tree Mews in \nYork\n \nechoed these results:\n a communal \nGSHP\n was installed with a nominal design \nCoP\n efficiency of 3.2-3.5. Despite a number of interventions, thr\noughout the year of monitoring the delivered \nCoP\n efficiency was 2.15 – that is, it failed the renewab\nle\n, and would not be \ngood value for the householder, nor contribute towards national renewable targets. \nE\nxpensive technology \nhad been\n installed under a false premise.\n&#xa0;\nA report by the Association for the Conservation of Energy, “Improving the energy efficiency of off-grid properties – the role of different heating technologies”, (March, 2011) made assumptions about the \nCoPs\n of heat pump\ns based on international data: “For GSHPs we assume a lower end \nCoP\n of 2.3 and a higher end \nCoP\n of\n 3.5. For ASHPs we assume  \nCoPs\n of 2.15 and 2.7 respectively”. On this basis all ASHPs would fail the test of being renewable since the qualifying ba\nr\n, and wo\nuld not deliver savings towards the EU targets; \na smaller number of \nGSHPs would also fail.\n&#xa0;\nThe Building Services Research and Information Association (BSRIA) is the leading independent \nUK\n laboratory for testing, certification and performance verification \nof a wide range of building services products. Its website discusses the pros and cons of heat pumps: “Test conditions (and hence manufacturers' quoted \nCoP\n data) can therefore differ significantly from actual design and operating conditions”. This confirms\n the essential point that it is not enough to accept pre-installation manufacturers’ quoted \nCoP\n data. BSRIA avert to manufacturers claiming impressive \nCoPs\n but say BSRIA, “This data should be treated with caution”. \n&#xa0;\nThe Energy Savings Trust has now publis\nhed Phase 2 of its testing on pumps (“The Heat is On”, May 2013). The bulk of this work involved a series of interventions on 32 of the failing Phase 1 sites over a three year period. In 12 cases the “interventions were “major”. In 10 cases, the interventi\nons involved the complete replacement of the pump systems. Even with all this no doubt expensive intervention: “Some sites did not improve, even with major and medium interventions”. The deficiency in performance was especially marked for ASHPs with 6 out \nof 15 still failing to make the renewable grade. From this we deduce that there is no case for continued taxpayer subsidy to ASHPs since even after extensive and costly intervention by experts an unacceptable proportion could not be made to work properly. \nThey would be ruled out as renewable by the EU and energy they generate would not count towards the \nUK\n’s renewable targets. The average performance of ASHPs was under the bar of being counted as renewable.\n&#xa0;\nTo be fair, after all this desperate effort over \nthree years, most GSHPs did work properly. How much all this extensive and expensive remediation would cost, and who would bear that cost – the installer or the householder – is a question for bitter experience in the market, but we draw a strong conclusio\nn from this that type-rating technology to a standard is a long way from actual installed performance. Let the buyer beware – and let the taxpayer beware of pouring subsidy into a technology that does not make the grade. Government should pay out subsidy o\nnly on those pumps tested as having delivered to minimum performance standards after installation. Time after time heat pumps simply do not do what is says on the tin.\nDuring cold weather heat pumps perform unacceptably&#xa0;\nThe BSRIA website \nemphasises that\n heat pumps can struggle at the coldest times of year, and their \nCoPs\n can fall below the acceptable: “The relevant test standard for most packaged heat pumps is \nBS EN 14511\n. For an air-to-water heat pump the standard specifies test conditions of 7\no\nC outdoo\nr air temperature (source temperature). At external air temperatures lower than this, the COP will fall, as will the heating output of the heat pump. Depending on the application this reduction may be \nsignificant,\n such as during a cold winter morning when \nbuilding pre-heat is needed”.\n&#xa0;\nIn \nEngland\n the average daily temperature is below 7°C in January and February; in \nScotland\n, the average daily temperature is below 7°C in December, January, February and March. \nIndeed, the mean temperature for the year in \nSco\ntland\n is 6.5\n°C. \nThe risk is, then, that for substantial parts of the year, varying by location heat pumps will struggle to deliver heat when it is cold outside.\n I\nt should come as no surprise that ASHPs should not prove so efficient when installed in the \nUK\n as their comparative systems in warmer continental countries.\n&#xa0;\nThe carbon footprint of pumps is higher than for gaseous fuels used in heating&#xa0;\nNote that even with \nCoPs\n of 2.9 the carbon footprint of heat pumps will be higher than the fossil fuel, natural \ngas. \nJohnson\n  in \nEnergy Policy\n,\n 2011, vol. 39, issue 3, pages 1369-1381 finds that at UK efficiencies heat-pump footprints (in kg CO2e emitted per kWh delivered) are comparable or higher than footprints of gaseous fuels used in heating. Compared with fossil fuel gas they don’t save carb\non \nso the \nUK\n taxpayer is paying to incentivise the expensive installation of a technology that is more polluting than a widely used fossil fuel\n.\n&#xa0;\nWide deployment of heat pumps would put a very expensive strain on the grid network&#xa0;\nThe Revised NPS (Oct. 201\n0) revealed the full implications of a pure electricity play including the electrification of heat: “Generation capacity will need \nat least to double to meet this demand and, if a significant proportion of our electricity is supplied from intermittent sour\nces, such as wind, solar, or tidal, then the total installed capacity might need to \ntriple” (para.1.66). This is a major driving factor behind the rising cost of energy to householders.\n&#xa0;\nDECC fingers heat pumps as a culprit\n: “In the case of heat pumps the \nchallenge to be managed is in the form of significant new electricity demand. Relative to a conventional household, installation of a heat pump could mean a doubling of annual electricity demand. Given heat demand coincides with peak electricity \ndemand, th\nis is likely to put additional load on the network when it is most strained. Clearly, roll out of heat pumps at scale will have significant impacts on our electricity network, (\nMicrogeneration\n Strategy Consultation Briefing, 23\nrd\n December 2010)\n”.\n&#xa0;\nThis is \na major driving factor behind the rising cost of energy to householders. The cost of this extra generating capacity is conservatively put at £200bn – Peter Atherton of \nLiberum\n Capital has assessed the infrastructure costs as being £376bn by 2030.\n&#xa0;\n“Network\n costs of a high heat pump deployment scenario are estimated to be £290 per heat pump on a GB-wide basis in 2030 (£390 in 2050). This compares to £1,130 per heat pump in rural areas in 2030 (£1,490 by 2050) (“Assessing the Impact of Large-Scale Deployment \nof Heat Pumps on Electricity Distribution Network Costs”, by Ernst and Young, 2013). These large extra costs will fall on the already hard-pressed consumer.\n&#xa0;\nThe media are aware of heat pumps’ problems&#xa0;\nA TV programme, “Rip Off Britain” (BBC1, 10\n.9.2012\n) on the performance of exhaust ASHPs as installed \n reported on r\nesidents from “across the estate” at the 160 acre affordable housing development at Love’s Farm in Cambridgeshire \nwho \nfound they were “\nwere being hit with huge energy bills… Instead of saving\n them money the heating system was actually costing them a lot more.” 69 houses at the \nCastlefields\n Estate in Runcorn are having their ASHPs ripped out and replaced with standard gas-fired \ncombi\n-boilers for similar reasons. One resident “was told her elect\nricity bill would cost around £320 a year but in fact her bills added up to £1200”. 15,000 of these \nexhaust \nASHPs had been installed in the \nUK\n and the programme reported: “We’ve heard from desperate residents on estates up and down the \nUK\n who’ve told us th\nat their eco-friendly heating has done the opposite of what they’d hope and pushed their bills up instead of down”.  \n&#xa0;\nThe programme returned to the issue on 17\nth\n September 2013 reporting on cases that had “rumbled on for years without anybody ever being a\nble to sort them out” with “homeowners across dozens of estates” and where “the same system has been fitted into thousands of homes across the country” and electricity bills turning out to be “fo\nu\nr times more than you were expecting”. As similar problems e\nmerge with subsidised pumps being widely installed across the country with achieved performances not coming up to the manufacturers’ claims who will be held responsible, and who will pick up the bill for remediation?\n \nAPPENDIX 1&#xa0;Air Source Heat Pumps Mak\ne Sense Without The RHI – \nBy Chris Davis – Business Development Director for \nDimplex\n \nRenewables\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
