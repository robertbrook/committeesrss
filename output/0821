Written evidence from defaultthe British Pain Society and defaultthe RCGP Clinical Champion for Chronic Paindefault (LTC 71)defaultWe
default wish to draw the attention of the Health Select Committee to the fact that chronic pain has very limited visibility and 
defaultprioritisation
default in the Long Term Conditions agenda. This is despite pain being 
defaultrecogni

default in parliament as a Long Term Condition on the 1

defaultTwo recent high level reports,

defaultboth published in December 2012, The National Pain Audit and the Health Survey England, were acknowledged and reported by Sir Bruce Keogh in one of his recent bulletins

defaultThe Health Survey for England revealed more than 14 million sufferers of chronic pain. The study found that pain is more common among some groups than others, incurs significant costs and has serious mental health and wellbeing implications.
defaultThe National Pain Audit showed the quality of life that chronic pain patients endure (average quality of life score (
defaultEuroQol
default) 0.4) is extremely low and also the inequity in the wide variation of
default availability and types of pain services that are available across England. On a positive note the audit showed the benefit of patients attending chronic pain services.
defaultWe
default would contend that chronic pain is one of , if the not the commonest Long Term Condition,
default 
defaultbut as yet there is no suggestion that it should be part of routine care planning for patients who are having the rest of their multiple co-morbidities frequently assessed.
defaultWe 
defaultwould ask the Health Select Committee to review this issue. 
defaultThe British Pain Society or the RCGP
default Clinical Champion for Chronic Pain
default would be happy to appear before the Committee to give further evidence regarding this enormous problem
default.
