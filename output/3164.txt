[[[How does Scotland compare to other countries in terms of the pattern of land ownership?]]]&#xa0;The Development Trusts Association Scotland (DTAS) is aware that land ownership patterns in Scotland are among the most concentrated in Europe. The pattern of the land ownership and the processes which contribute to this state of affairs are well documented in books such as Wightman’s “The Poor Had No Lawyers”. Other authors such as Riddoch have highlighted how a much more diverse and pluralistic pattern of land ownership has positively influenced the development of more resilient communities and societies, particularly within the Nordic nations. DTAS also notes that with the exception of growth in the community ownership of land, the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 has had little overall impact on patterns of land ownership in Scotland. &#xa0;

[[[What are the benefits and disadvantages of the current pattern of land ownership, and to what extent is this pattern sustained and reinforced by subsidy and taxation arrangements?]]]&#xa0;The pattern of land ownership has a major impact on the wellbeing of Scotland, and its ability to deliver its economic, social and environmental objectives going forward. Land, property and other physical assets have always been a significant lever of both economic and social development. If anything, current patterns of land ownership in Scotland reflect a bygone economic age, and a key element in the future prosperity of Scotland will be the transfer of land and assets from those who did make a beneficial economic impact in the past, to those who have the potential to make a beneficial impact going forward. In addition, patterns of land ownership influence the way in which land is made available, and this issue, coupled with the high cost of land, are key contributory factors to the current housing crisis in Scotland. Without any such transfer, patterns of land ownership are likely to hinder rather than enable both economic and social progress. The ownership of land is also a critical factor in the ability of Scotland to contribute to addressing the environmental and climate change challenges which we face. In short, Scotland’s ability to fully achieve its economic, social and environmental objectives will require, among other things, the progressive reform of current patterns of land ownership. While DTAS has limited taxation expertise, we have no doubt that the current pattern of land ownership is sustained and reinforced through a combination of tax incentives and public subsidy. We believe that for too long this issue has not been adequately recognised, and we welcome the Scottish Affairs Committee’s scrutiny of this key issue.&#xa0;

[[[Is the current system of land tenure in Scotland the most efficient model for food security?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]DTAS has insufficient information to comment at a macro level on different models of agriculture, but we are in a position to draw from the experience of our members. Within the DTAS membership, there are many communities who are increasingly conscious of climate change, reducing their carbon footprint and driving forward a localism agenda. A key element of this activity is where and how food is grown and sold. Access to appropriate land, and relationships with land owners, can often frustrate these community ambitions. Throughout Scotland there is a growing demand for allotments (evidenced by the size of council waiting lists) and a huge interest in community growing projects, yet little evidence of public or private land being made available in sufficient quantities for these purposes.&#xa0;

[[[In particular, is the current land ownership pattern contributing to, or inhibiting, economic and community development? Is it socially just?]]]&#xa0;While the economic, social, and environmental case for land reform in Scotland is compelling, the direct interest of development trusts (reflected in the Scottish Government’s 2011 Regeneration Strategy) is that of community-led regeneration. The context for this is the relatively unsuccessful top-down regeneration approach which has characterised Scottish urban regeneration policy for decades, and the relatively greater success of locally led processes (community land ownership, tenant co-operatives, locally controlled housing associations, community enterprise and community renewables). Since our establishment 10 years ago, DTAS has consistently argued that the acquisition, development and management of assets, within a framework of enterprise, is a critical element of successful community-led regeneration, and while it is difficult to give a definitive answer, the general experience across our membership is that current patterns of land ownership are much more likely to be a hindrance than a help to community regeneration processes. Ownership of land and the control of resources (public and private) clearly mitigate against achieving empowered communities. Previous urban regeneration partnerships have more often masked the inequality of power, than recognised and addressed it. Within rural communities the power of the large estate remains a significant influence (positive and negative) over many aspects of community life. Genuine community empowerment (a stated Scottish Government objective) therefore requires a transfer of land and asset ownership, and control of significant budgets, to local communities. &#xa0;

[[[Given mounting political interest in, or commitment to, a programme of land reform in Scotland, what form should this programme take?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Given the undoubted significance of land reform in Scotland, and its importance relative to achieving a successful and sustainable economic, social and environmental future, the issue

[[[ ]]]demands a much wider debate which engages a much wider cross-section of the Scottish population. Historically, land reform in Scotland has been regarded as a rural issue and progressed within the context of rural development. However, land reform has, arguably, as many implications for the vast majority of the population who live in urban settlements. Therefore DTAS would argue that any land reform programme needs to be broad based and comprehensive, and rooted within the economic, social and environmental future of Scotland. Given the multi-dimensional nature of the issue, land reform should not be an occasional or periodic exercise, but, as Lord Sewell pointed out, an ongoing process. &#xa0;At a local level, achieving increased levels of community ownership requires a radical rethink and significant cultural change. The Community Right to Buy provision should be made a universal measure and further legislation should facilitate a transfer of power from private and public land owners to communities (as articulated through democratically accountable community bodies). We need to re-think our definition of ‘public ownership’ in a way which recognizes the right of communities to be alternative (and often more appropriate) stewards of public assets. Community ownership also requires building confidence and raising aspirations, good quality support and capacity building and the availability of sufficient funding and finance to assist both the acquisition and the development of assets. &#xa0;

[[[What sort of subsidies and grants are available to landed estate owners in Scotland? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the subsidy regime? In particular, are support payments being capitalized into land values and making these higher than they otherwise would be?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]DTAS would not profess to have detailed knowledge of this area, but we believe that high and rising land values are not in the interests of local communities, nor the objectives of the Scottish Government, and our sense is that the current framework of taxation and public subsidy are a major factors contributing to this problem. Our members do have direct experience of the Rural Development Programme which seems to greatly benefit the interests of large land owners at the expense of communities who are genuinely engaged in rural development. A successful land reform progamme will clearly require a carrot and stick approach, and taxation and public subsidy should be designed to provide this in a way which delivers the articulated objectives of land reform. &#xa0;

[[[How does the tax regime affect the way in which land is owned in Scotland? For instance, does it offer landed estate owners the opportunity to minimize the tax they pay, thereby increasing the value of land, adding to speculative interest (on the part of those looking for ways to minimize or avoid tax) and making it less likely that it will be made available to others?]]]&#xa0;DTAS does not have enough information to comment on this. &#xa0;

[[[How easy is it for communities in Scotland to take ownership of land and other assets? Should it be made easier in the light of the substantial achievements of existing community ownership groups?]]]&#xa0;In general, it is currently very difficult for communities to take ownership of land and other assets. While the Community Right to Buy provision and the availability of some grant funding has undoubtedly helped, those communities who have taken ownership of land and assets have often done so in the face of significant barriers and challenges. For those rural communities outwith the Highlands &amp; Islands Enterprise (HIE) area, there has not been anything like the same level of advice and support for land acquisition available. In addition, the vast majority of the Scottish population live in urban settlements, and by definition have been excluded from the limited benefits of CRtB and some of the funding programmes available to support community ownership. &#xa0;If, as a country, we want to increase community ownership (and DTAS would argue along with others that the case for this is overwhelming) then clearly we have to make the process easier. DTAS currently runs a Scottish Government-funded Community Ownership Support Service, and to give one example, it took Gargunnock Development Trust seven years to get ownership of their community centre from their local council, despite the Council already having decided to dispose of this asset. In addition to extending CRtB-type provisions to all communities, we have to give communities the powers to be pro-active, and to be able to purchase land and assets from an unwilling seller, when this can be demonstrated to be in the public interest.&#xa0;

[[[How easy is it for tenant farmers in Scotland to buy their farms? Should they be granted an absolute right to buy? Would such a right be compatible with human rights conventions and declarations?]]]&#xa0;This issue is out-with the scope of the experience of DTAS and, as such, no comment is offered. However we have a general concern about the selective use of Human Rights legislation being used as a defence of landed interests, even when a greater public benefit can be demonstrated. We await the publication of Scotland’s first Human Rights Action Plan in December with interest!  &#xa0;

[[[Is there a case for establishing a Land Agency to facilitate both the expansion of community ownership and the creation of new, especially “starter”, tenancies on land acquired for this purpose?]]]&#xa0;As has been suggested above, there is a need for communities to be properly supported in land and asset acquisition (and development) processes, and experience suggests that there is also a strong case for mediation-type interventions, ideally supported by some back-stop power. DTAS has no fixed view on how this is achieved, and believe that the Land Agency proposal is certainly worthy of consideration. While this idea would benefit from being scoped out in a bit more detail, we would have a concern that the linking of community land acquisition with agricultural tenancies seems to push land reform back into a rural development box. &#xa0;

[[[How easy is it for land in public ownership to be transferred to communities and other private individuals,  where that would be in the public interest? Should steps be taken to make it easier? For instance, should the UK and Scottish Governments compile a register showing land and assets for disposal? Should there be changes in the way in which such land and assets are valued? What UK Treasury rules are relevant to this area?]]]&#xa0;DTAS has 4 years experience of working with local authorities on asset transfer policies and practices, and has increasingly been involved in discussions with other public bodies on this issue. Our response to this question reflects both this experience, and that of our members (and COSS clients) in trying to acquire public sector assets. &#xa0;Firstly, our general observation would be that it is 

[[[anything but easy]]] for communities to acquire assets from local authorities and other public sector bodies, even when they have been declared surplus to requirements! Encouragingly more and more Councils in Scotland are developing asset transfer strategies and policies (by asset transfer we mean the transfer of assets to communities at less than market value) but this needs to be balanced against the increasing pressure on local authorities to maximize capital receipts. Many of the surplus ‘assets’ being offered to communities are in fact liabilities, and communities need support to critically assess opportunities which become available. Interestingly COSS is currently experiencing an increase in assets with a heritage value being made available to communities.&#xa0;The development of asset transfer strategies, and clear and balanced processes, is certainly part of the way forward, and other public sector bodies (with the exception of the Forestry Commission who already have the National Forest Land Scheme) should be required to develop these. Currently local authorities have a discretionary power to transfer at less than market value, and this discretionary power needs to be extended to other public bodies. However, this will not in itself, deliver the transfer of assets to communities at less than market value.&#xa0;Audit Scotland recently concluded that Scottish Local Authorities currently have £3 billion worth of surplus assets, which begs the question of why there is a capital finance problem within Councils! This value is, of course, the paper value which is based on accountancy convention, and substantially overvalues assets. The ‘market price’ is usually based on these values. However, the real market value is what the council can sell an asset for at any particular point in time! If they can’t sell it (and usually when it is offered to communities this is the case) then it has no market value! The difficulty for public officials is that Scotland effectively operates two accounting systems - conventional accounting, which gives us inflated values, and best value, the code of practice of which does not require councils to show financial value. Public bodies need a much clearer lead on how they approach disposal of assets to communities from both Audit Scotland and the Scottish Government. DTAS believes that if, for whatever reasons, communities can do things with assets which councils are unable to do, and that activity increases financial value, then that should be supported! It’s not about stripping assets, but rather developing a more sophisticated way of building financial value in communities, which will in turn contribute to economic growth. &#xa0;

[[[Should a Land Value Tax of some sort be introduced in Scotland, as a replacement or addition to council tax and business rates?]]]&#xa0;DTAS does not have a position on Land Value Tax, but in recognising the undoubted need to deflate land values to further economic and social progress (including meeting housing need) then it is difficult to see how this can be done without a radical reappraisal of land and property taxes.&#xa0;October 2013
