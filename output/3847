Written evidence submitted by Amnesty International UK (JRR 0015)default&#xa0;defaultOn 18 July 2013
default, the Joint Committee on Human Rights launched an inquiry into the implications for access to justice of certain of the 
defaultUK g
defaultovernment
default’
defaults proposals to reform legal aid. Amnesty International submitted written evidence to the C
defaultommittee on 27 September 2013 highlighting the organization
default’
defaults serious concern that the proposals 
defaultwill deny legal aid and access to justice to vulnerable individuals. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOn 06 September 2013
default,
default defaultthe UK government published a series of new proposals in 
defaultits Consultation Paper 
defaultJudicial Review: Proposals for further reform.
default In 
defaultresponse to
default a call for further written evidence by the Joint Committee on Human Rights, this submission highlights Amnesty International
default’
defaults concerns with respect to the government
default’
defaults pr
defaultoposed 
defaultchanges, focussing on their implications for human rights. These submissions should be considered together with Amnesty International
default’
defaults previous written evidence 
defaultdated
default 27 September.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIn its consultation document, the government describes judicial review as 
default“a critical check on the power of the state, providing an effective mechanism for challenging the decisions, acts or omissions of publ
defaultic bodies to ensure that they are lawful”
default.
default This is accurate. Judicial review focuses on the exercise of, and potential misuse of, executive power. As such, it crucial
defaultly
default support
defaults
default 
defaulta
default fundamental tenet of the rule of law 
default–
default that no-one is above the law
default -
default by ho
defaultlding the Executive accountable to the law and due process. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAmnesty International is concerned about the effect of the proposals on the rule of law and access to justice. In particular, Amnesty International is concerned that the proposals discussed belo
defaultw will significantly undermine the effectiveness of the judicial review mechanism, a critical part of the system of checks on government compliance with its obligations, including human rights obligations. These concerns are further compounded by the lack 
defaultof evidence presented by the government to support its proposals.
default&#xa0;
defaultSet out below is more detail on: (1) the lack of evidence supporting the proposals; (2) the
default implications of the
default proposed changes to standing
default (a) and third party interventions 
default(b)
default; and (3)
default the implications of
default the proposed changes to costs (specifically Protective Costs Orders).
default&#xa0;
defaultThe
default are
defaultas highlighted in this evidence are those where
default Amnesty International is best placed to contribute to the 
defaultCommittee’
defaults inquiry. Where other proposals are no
defaultt dealt with in this 
defaultevidence, this
default should not be taken as an indication that Amnesty International agrees with those proposals or considers that they do not have 
defaultimplications for
default human rights.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultFrom the outset Amnesty
default International
default would draw the Committee
default’
defaults attention to the lack of evidence underpinning the proposals made in the consultation document and the fact that, where evidence is presented, it does not support the case that the government attempts to make. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe government 
defaultmakes two main claims on the basis of the statistics presented: (i) that the use of judicial review has expanded massively in recent years; and (ii) that judicial review is used as a 
default‘
defaultcampaigning tool
default’
default, where unmeritorious claims are brought by campaigning
default NGOs and others simply to attract publicity. The evidence presented does not support these contentions. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe government
default’
defaults figures and graphs on page 8 of the proposals are presented alongside a statement that 
default“[t]he number of judicial review applications
default has more than doubled in recent years”.
default However, the only significant increase shown is in immigration and asylum cases, which the government recognises are soon to be redirected to the Upper Tribunal and are therefore irrelevant to the proposed reforms.
default The remaining, 
defaultrelevant
default cases show an almost static line, and certainly do not demonstrate the claimed proliferation of judicial review actions; which forms the main basis of these proposals.
default&#xa0;
defaultT
defaulthe government points out in its proposals that between 2007 a
defaultnd 2011, around 50 judicial reviews per year “
defaultappear to have been lodged by… claimants who may not have had a direct interest in the matter at hand”
default 
defaultand expresses its concern “
defaultthat the wide approach to standing… [allows] judicial review to be used to seek
default publicity or otherwise to hinder the process of decision-making
default”.
default However, in 2011, even excluding immigration, asylum and planning cases, these cases 
default‘
defaultof concern
default’
default represented only two per cent of all judicial reviews.
default Furthermore, these types of cases 
defaultare in reality 
defaultrelatively
default successful
default 
defaultwhen compared with other judicial review claims
default, as the government points out.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultSo the government has highlighted a type of judicial review which forms a 
defaultsmall fraction
default of all judicial reviews, and which is 
defaultdisproport
defaultionately successful
default on the merits. Clearly, this does not appear to justify the government
default’
defaults claimed need to seriously restrict standing on the basis of these cases
default’
default demands on the court system. Even accepting the government
default’
defaults approach of judging the value
default of judicial review on the success rate of cases (an approach with which Amnesty International would have reservations), the relatively successful track record of this type of judicial review would seem to lead to the opposite conclusion; that the broader 
defaulttest for standing should be retained as it allows more meritorious claims to be brought, increasing the 
default‘
defaultvalue for money
default’
default of judicial review in terms of court resources
default.
default  
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultA key issue raised by the proposals concerns who ought and ought not to have “standing” to bring a claim for judicial review. The government argues that over time the test for standing in judicial review has been interpreted too widely
default,
default 
default“allowing judicial 
defaultreview to be used to 
defaultseek publicity or otherwise to hinder the process of proper decision-making”.
default 
defaultThe government therefore proposes restricting the test for standing so that individuals and groups 
defaultwithout
default a “direct” or “direct and tangible” interest in t
defaulthe outcome of the proceedings do not have standing to bring judicial review claims. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAmnesty International is concerned that the government
default’
defaults proposals 
defaultwould 
defaultunnecessarily
default 
defaultrestrict who is able to bring judicial review claims before the courts
default, undermining
default the rule of law by limiting the remedies available to hold the government to account, including for failure to comply with its human rights obligations.
default&#xa0;
defaultFor example, the consultation paper references the case of 
defaultR (on the application of Maya Evans) v Sec
defaultretary of State for Defence 
defaultpresumably in order to highlight cases where the government thinks it is wrong that a particular person could bring a claim. However, this case is an example of precisely the kind of case which raises issues of fundamental impor
defaulttance to the public interest
default, the rule of law and human rights
default, namely the UK
default’
defaults policy and practice in relation to the transfer of detainees to the Afghan authorities and the risk of torture and other ill-treatment those individuals would face.
default  Amnesty 
defaultI
defaultnternational is concerned that the restriction on standing to those who have a direct and tangible interest will prevent these kinds of cases from being heard before the courts.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe proposals also fail to properly consider instances where there 
defaultmay
default 
defaultnot 
defaultbe
default individuals with a direct interest in the outcome, for example where an unlawful policy exists but has not yet affected any individuals. It is precisely this reasoning which has led the courts to develop and relax the test for standing in judicial revie
defaultw in the way they have; out of a concern about restrictions on access to
default justice.
default Changing the rules on standing as proposed would undermine access to justice and the rule of law. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultThe government expresses concern that third parties who 
defaultintervene in judicial review cases may over-complicate matters and unnecessarily add to costs. The government makes three main proposals in this regard: (i) to restrict the test for standing for judicial review claims to exclude these third parties; (ii) t
defaulto require third party interveners to be responsible in principle for their own legal costs resulting from the intervention; and (iii) to require third party interveners to be responsible for any significant extra costs incurred by the existing parties to t
defaulthe claim. 
default&#xa0;
defaultT
defaulthe government’s claimed concerns are unlikely to materialize in practice. 
defaultIt is rare that any third party intervener is awarded its legal costs, and judges have discretion to refuse to allow third party interventions where these might over-com
defaultplicate matters or disproportionately add to costs. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFurther, t
defaulthird party NGOs and voluntary sector organizations, such as Amnesty International, do not take lightly the decision to intervene in court proceedings (whether judici
defaultal review or other proceedi
defaultngs).
default Amnesty International would only do so where: (i) there is an important legal principle at stake; and (ii) the organization is able to bring additional expertise and useful legal arguments. Joining a case as a third party requires considerable commit
defaultment in terms of resources (which are often scarce at these organizations). If an intervention were made, this would only be following detailed consideration (with the input of in-house legal experts and possibly external counsel). 
default&#xa0;
defaultB
defaulty intervening, these 
defaultthird parties are likely to bring added expertise, which will allow the case to be better argued and considered.
default Even where c
defaultosts 
defaultin a specific case are 
defaultincreased by an intervention (which is doubtful, 
defaultgiven that the 
defaultintervention
default 
defaulti
defaults likely to 
defaultresult in
default the
default issues be
defaulting
default more clearly argued and efficiently dealt with), 
defaultfocussing on a single case 
defaultignores the fact that 
defaulta well-run 
defaultcase may establish a clear precedent which disposes of the need for numerous other individual cases. 
default&#xa0;
defaultRestricting the right of these
default organizations to intervene would reverse the effect described above, and therefore be detrimental to the rule of law and to the effectiveness of the system of checks and balances on governmental action. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is also troubling that these proposals will det
defaulter third party interventions from organizations that are unable to take any additional costs risks, whereas interventions will continue to be made by those representing well-resourced interests including companies and the government itself. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultA Protective Cost
defaults
default Order (PCO) limits the costs exposure of a claimant in a public interest case. In the consultation document the government raises concern that PCOs are being granted in too wide a range of circumstances; in particular that an expanding approach to PCOs
default “h
defaultas tipped the balance too far and now allows PCOs to be used when the claimant is bringing a judicial review for his or her own benefit”
default.
default The government also questions whether
default costs protection ought to continue to be available for
default “political” and “campaig
defaultning” judicial review claims
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultPCOs are an important tool available to the courts to “level the playing field” between the claimants and defendants in order that certain cases can be brought which are in the public interest. As such, they help to promote the rule of law by holding the E
defaultxecutive to account in instances where there might otherwise be no claimant willing and able to bring proceedings. Amnesty International is concerned that the proposals concerning PCOs will seriously deter these types of claim from being brought, because t
defaulthe financial risk in bringing such claims will be too high. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe proposals, when read as a whole, also appear fundamentally unworkable
default and will result in a greater restriction on access to justice than at first appears
default. The government proposes to: reform 
defaultthe test for standing to require a “direct interest” or “direct or tangible interest”; and at the same time remove the availability of PCOs for claimants who have a “private interest”. In its proposals, the government does not specify 
defaultprecisely what is mea
defaultnt by “direct interest” or “direct and tangible interest” (and invites views on an appropriate test), but if “direct interest” and “private interest” are in effect the same test (which appears likely)
default, then no claimant with standing to bring a judicial re
defaultview would be able to benefit from a PCO. The effect will not be to limit the availability of PCOs, but to 
defaultremove them entirely
default. This will prevent many claimants from bringing claims resulting from legitimate grievances, because the financial risk would si
defaultmply be far too high.    
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultAs we have highlighted previously, the government’s proposals to reform legal aid 
defaultwill deny legal aid protection and access to justice to poor and vulnerable people 
defaultand inhibit the ability of individuals to hold to ac
defaultcount public bodies and officials for their actions and decisions
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultgovernment’s more recent proposed judicial review reforms
default - if implemented - would make it 
defaulteven
default more difficult to hold the government and public bodies to account
default. The proposals would
default insulat
defaulte
default executive action from adequate judicial scrutiny, and significantly 
defaultundermine checks on government compliance with its obligations, including human rights obligations
default.
default 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultTaken individually, these two sets of proposals have negative implications 
defaultfor the promotion and protection of human rights and the rule of law. When taken together, the combined effect of the proposals is even more severe. Amnesty International calls upon the Committee to consider this evidence and the evidence submitted by othe
defaultr interested parties carefully, and to use its position to persuade the government to rethink these harmful proposals.
