[[[Introduction]]]&#xa0;

[[[Overview of the Situation]]]For example, on 12 August 2013, the Prime Minister, David Cameron, stated in the Telegraph newspaper that he thought fracking should receive public support.  Furthermore, HM Treasury in its report Investing on Britain’s Future (Command 8669,June 2013) indicated that shale gas exploitation is important in relation to Britain’s future prosperity and that the Government is likely to support the process, partly through a target of the Environment Agency being able to issue permits by February 2014 within 1-2 weeks of receipt. 

[[[The Legal and Regulatory Processes]]](i)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The adequacy of the current legal regime.Fracking is a controversial process as far as the general public is concerned.  Consequently, simpler, more streamlined and overt regulation could provide the public with the reassurances it needs and thus be welcomed by industry.  There is no overall control of the process as a variety of public sector organisations and regulators are involved and/or consulted at various stages. The regulatory process in Wales is complex, partly due to the fact that development of major energy projects is not a devolved function.  As a result, licenses for the  exploration and development (Petroleum Exploration and Development Licences – PEDLs) of shale gas resources are granted by the UK Government’s Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC).  There are numerous pieces of legislation and regulation relevant to obtaining overall permission to explore and exploit shale gas resources.  These cover town and country planning; water resources; environmental permitting; hazardous waste; design and construction of wells; operation of borehole sites; dangerous substances and explosive atmospheres; use of works equipment; and mineral mining.  Apart from obtaining PEDLs from DECC for testing for and extraction of methane gas from shale rock, planning permission has to be granted by local planning authorities.  Natural Resources Wales and the Health and Safety Executive are also consulted, notified and involved during the processes.  The former is concerned with pollution control and is served notices of the proposed development, determines and issues abstraction licences and discharge consents (and possibly flare emission permits), whilst the latter has to agree the drilling activity.  The agreement of both landowners on the site concerned and adjacent landowners has to be obtained and, if coal seams are affected, which is the case in many potential areas of Wales, the Coal Authority will need to be consulted.  This complex, multi-layered agency process involves a number of risks, such as the potential for communication failures; the loss of opportunity to develop wide expertise in fracking, and its environmental and other impacts; the lengthy and complex decision making process acting as a barrier to industry development; and confusion amongst the public about where responsibility lies and how they can engage with the process of granting approvals and permissions.  Although the UK process is more robust than that in the US, there are concerns about whether it is fit for purpose and sufficiently robust to ensure environmental and community impacts are minimised.    (ii)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The resourcing of the regulators and the transparency of the approval processThe adequate resourcing of NRW, as the lead regulator in Wales, in terms of manpower and the necessary expertise, will be essential in providing potential developers with the confidence to explore and possibly exploit resources in Wales.  Regulation is only as good as the resources available for setting appropriate permitting conditions and ensuring their subsequent enforcement.  It is, therefore, important that NRW regulatory staff possess the necessary background experience to manage the processes of fracking effectively.  For the reasons given above, the fact that the processes for granting permissions for exploration and extraction of shale gas are so complex (involving the application of a number of regulatory regimes) poses significant obstacles to the development and regulation of this sector, and presents difficulties for the public in terms of having a clear and joined up understanding of the overall process.    

[[[Conclusion]]]12.The technology is evolving and major energy companies, such as Centrica, are now investing in this area.  Exploitation of shale gas seems to have the potential benefit of bringing greater security of energy supplies, although there is no definitive assessment of the extent of exploitable shale gas reserves in Wales.  More research is needed, therefore, and the regulators need to keep up to date with developments, as well as playing an active role with the industry, policy developers and the research community.13.  The exploitation of shale gas may have the capacity to contribute to the Welsh economy, but there is still a considerable amount of technical, political, economic, regulatory and environmental work to be done before it can be relied upon as an economically viable energy source that can be exploited in a sustainable way.  In particular, the legal processes that apply to the process of fracking need to be consolidated and simplified.  The current system is complex requiring permissions and consents from a number of different regulatory bodies.  Accordingly, it is essential that regulators have adequate resources to maintain and develop expertise in, and experience of, managing the risks to the public and the environment that arise from exploration and exploitation of Wales’s shale gas reserves. 19 December 2013 &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
