"EIS 18\nWritten evidence submitted by the Confederation of UK Coal Producers (COALPRO)&#xa0;\nBackgroundThe C\nonfederation of UK Coal Producers (Coalpro)\n represents the \ncoal\n ind\nustry within the United Kingdom, our members produce 95% of the \ncoal\n mined in the UK from both deep and surface mines\n. The UK \nCoal \nIndustry\n produced 16.3Mt in 2012 around 90% of which was sold into power stations in the UK.\n \nCoalpro is a member of the CBI M\ninerals Group.\nThese sales would otherwise be replaced by imported coal as almost 50Mt was consumed by UK power stations in 2012. The industry employed just over 6,000 people to produce this output and although this has declined in 2013 following the closu\nre of Maltby Colliery and Daw Mill Colliery and the collapse of two of the companies operating surface mines in Scotland we expect the figure to be well in excess of 4,500 direct employees by the early part of 2014 as some the operations in Scotland re-com\nmence production. In addition to the power station market coal is an essential and affordable fuel for households which are off the gas grid (estimated to be 6 million homes) and of course is used by some key industries such as cement and sugar processing.\n \nOne industry which has to use coal is steel-making as the carbon in the coal and the iron ore chemically bond in the blast furnace, in this case there is no alternative fuel and although the majority of the coal used in this process in the UK is imported\n there are some coals which are suitable in parts of the UK, notably North-East England and South Wales. Tata steel have a policy of preferring to purchase these coals when they are available, as they provide secure and local supplies with reduced costs of\n transportation both in fuel and emissions. The suitability depends on the characteristics of each individual coal seam in the mine and the mine must have other markets for the other coal seams it mines (principally power generation).   \nExecutive SummaryQuestions&#xa0;&#xa0;\nCoal mining in the UK contributes both financially and socially on a national and local level. Coal deposits are present in some of the more economically deprived areas of Scotland , Northern England and South Wales and the mines, whether surface or underg\nround,  predominantly employ local labour. The cost of regenerating these areas after deep mine closure both in social and economic terms is well known to Government. In addition, local haulage and small engineering businesses depend on the coal mines, bot\nh surface and underground, for a large proportion of their turnover. \nA large proportion of rail freight traffic is from the transport of bulk materials, c35% in 2010 of all freight was the haulage of coal to power stations, UK produced coal accounts for a\nbout one third of this total. Track access fees for these movements make up a significant portion of Network Rail’s income.\n&#xa0;\nCase Study \n&#xa0;\n              \n              \nKier Minerals Ltd Greenburn Surface Coal Mine\nKier Minerals Ltd (part of Kier Group Plc)   currently own and operate\n a surface coal mine in the UK, the Greenburn Surface Mine, near New Cumnock in East Ayrshire. Reserves exist to continue until 2022.\nAt the end of August 2013\n the\n site has produced 5,492,000 tonnes of coal supplying English power stations by rail and cont\nributing to an indigenous solution to UK energy security.\n&#xa0;\nThe Greenburn operation currently employs 151 hourly paid individuals and additionally 48 sub-contractors are permanently employed giving a total of 199. Of this total 84 live within 10 miles of th\ne site and 116 live within a 15 mile radius. \n&#xa0;\nBased on the above employment figures and using Scottish Government published multipliers\n,\n a further 160 \nindirect jobs (plant hire\n,\n \nhaulage eq\nuipment repair etc) are created\n,\n \nand a further 234 \ninduced jobs (\njo\nbs supported by direct and i\nndirect employees spending wage\n).\nSource:\n \n(\nhttp://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Economy/Input-Outpu\nt/Downloads/IO1998-2009latest\n&#xa0;\nThese figure are in the context of sign\nificant unemployment of 10.9% (\nApril 2012 to March 2013)\n for East Ayrshire \nwhich rises to 11.9% when considering males only\n, who are typically \nemployed\n in mining\n. The wage bill in the\n last financial year was £5.73 million\n,\n the majority going into the local commun\nity within 15 miles of the site\n.\n Source:\n \n(\nhttps://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/lmp/la/2038432129/report.aspx\nhttp://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/index.html\n&#xa0;\nKier have also contributed £1.54 million (end August 2013) into the local community trust which p\nrovides funding to local community projects and will continue to contribute on future production.  \n&#xa0;\nKier Group plc has established a Non-Vocational Qualification (NVQ) Centre at Greenburn. To date the Centre has completed 116 vocational qualifications in \nlevel 2 Plant Operations plus 6 supervisors achieving level 3 awards. \n&#xa0;\nFurther Example\n&#xa0;\nUK Coal Production Ltd operates a surface coal mine called Potland Burn near Ashington in Northumberland. The site commenced operations in 2010 and will extract 2.2 mi\nllion tonnes of coal over its five year life\n, in 2012 the site employed 96 people of whom 82% live within 15 miles of the site. As part of a signed Legal Agreement the company has contributed £500,000 into a local community fund which is used to promote co\nmmunity benefits and amenities. \n&#xa0;\nAll the coal from site is transported by rail to English Power Stations and has a much lower Carbon Footprint from both excavation and delivery than imported coal.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe indigenous \ncoal\n industry\n in the UK provides high quality jobs in rural or deprived areas, both directly employed in the mining operations but also in the supply chain and in particular the speci\nalist equipment and plant required, and the maintenance and small engineering and repair sector. The coal industry employed over 6,000 people in 2012 and despite the closure of Maltby and Daw Mill Collieries in 2013 and the suspension of operations at the \nmajority of sites in Scotland there are 4,100 employees at the end of August 2013 which we expect to increase to in excess of 4,500 during the next six months as operations in Scotland re-start. \n&#xa0;\nSupply chain jobs dependent on the coal mining sector are a\nround 15,000.\n&#xa0;\nMining consultants from UK based organisations are busy on coal and other mineral projects worldwide and particularly in India currently. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe \nConsultancy services from the UK on mining projects are in high demand, and the fact that they are familiar with UK coal underground systems gives the competitive advan\ntage that the deep reserves worked here give unique experience, compared with some other coal deposits worldwide.\n&#xa0;\nUK manufacturers were involved at the start of the mechanisation programme which changed the face of underground coal production in the \n1960’s and 1970’s. The continuing development and improvements made to this equipment as reserves became deeper again enhances the design and supply reputation of UK based companies.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIn the coal sector\n,\n UK operations are all performed by UK based companies and very few have overseas interests. The presence of large mining compan\nies in London offices does not encourage them to use UK based suppliers\n,\n and most mining equipment supply is now done by large global corporations\n, notwithstanding that, the engineering design for these products is maintained in the UK but some of the manu\nfacturing has moved to China and USA.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Coalpro has no relevant information to enable it to make comment on this question.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe believe the level of engagement with NGOs and communities in the UK is excellent at both a local and national level. Examples of the engagement are set out below:\n&#xa0;\nNational Engagement - The UK Minerals Forum.\nThe UK Minerals Forum was set \nup \nby the CBI Minerals Group in 2006 \n(of which Coalpro is a member) \nbecause there was \na perceived n\need to draw together all key stak\neholders, to debate and inform G\novernment and the public on the prudent use, sustainable management and supply of UK minerals. The UKMF has a broad membership drawn from \nindustry, regulators, NGOs and G\novernment\n who sit as observers\n. It holds regular meetings and convenes working groups \nto research and report on critical issues. We believe the Forum is a good example of best practice in engagement between \nall stakeholders who\n have an interest in the UK based extractive industry\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe \nForum is submitting its own evidence to the Committee a\nnd further details can be viewed at: \nhttp://www.bgs.ac.uk/ukmf/home.html\n&#xa0;\n              \nLocal EngagementEngagement with local communities is enshrined within the land use planning legis\nlation and the coal industry \nhas for\n many years worked hard to be part or the local community rather\n than\n apart from it.\n In all cases the surface mined coal sites set up a Community Fund of which the local liaison group and the Parish Council decide the most appropriate use for the co\nmmunity adjacent to or affected by the mining operation.\n \nSite specific liaison groups normally include representatives of local residents, local elected officials and locally based NGOs. Further details on the statutory obligation to engage with local comm\nunities can be viewed at:\n   \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/policies/giving-communities-more-power-in-planning-local-development&#xa0;During any p\nlanning application and during site operations the mining companies work with bodies such as English Nature, English Heritage, RSPB, SEPA and Natural Resources Wales.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAfter recent changes in both the deep mine and surface mine portfolio in England and Scotland, UK\n listed extractive companies \nwith\n operations in \nthe \nUK \ndo not have coal mining interests outside these shores. The large London listed mining companies have no operations in the UK \nand thus have limited \nincentive to support the\n UK skills base. In its heyday\n,\n the UK underground coal industry was a key driver in\n providing the skills base for the extractive industries\n,\n but with its now virtual demise the number of mining and related\n training\n course\ns\n has dwindled to very few. \nUndergraduate degrees in Mining Engineering were offered at a number of Universities as re\ncently as 20 years ago and graduates found employment worldwide.  \nThe l\nack of a large\n indigenous industry\n also\n means there is reduced opportunity for students to gain practical experience or interest \nin \nmining operations. \n The  recruitment of new Managers \ninto the UK coal industry is difficult, and the path that formerly existed of gaining practical experience in the UK and then using those skills worldwide has disappeared. \n \n&#xa0;\nThe main mining relate\nd courses are now restricted to \nvery few universities, such\n as Camborne School of Mines, part of the Exeter University and course\ns\n provided by \nD\nerby and Northumbria Universities  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSo far as Coalpro is aware there has been no contact to involve coal mining companies in discussion of the possibility of signing up to the EITI.\n&#xa0;\nThe regulatory framework in the UK currently ensures that all payments made to local and central movement in the form of fees, \nbusiness rates and other \ntaxes and contributions to \nlocal infrastructure is\n done so in a fully transparent way\n,\n and the Group bel\nieves that there is no requirement\n for\n further regulation.\n&#xa0;\nIt is noted from the press release dated 10\nth\n July 2013 posted on the EITI website that Business Minister Jo Swinson said \n…..“Under the EITI, extractives companies operating in the UK would report\n material payments to the UK government, totalling billions of pounds, who will also report the receipts it received. The payments of tax, licence fees and other receipts will be disclosed in reports conforming to the EITI standards\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe seek urgent dialo\ngue on the status of UK based extraction under EITI.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Government should be aware that London listed extractive companies currently have global offices and operations, they might view any attempt by the UK to impose further regulation as restrictive and decide to centre their businesses elsewhere.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;If we wish to keep the core skills in coal mining and maintain our reputation as some of the best Mini\nng Engineers at depth or the most efficient truck and shovel method surface miners then an Energy Policy has to be developed that allows coal-fired power stations to continue in operation until 2030. \n&#xa0;\nWe believe there is too much focus on the short term i\nn Government. There are long lead times, often \nat least \nten years, to bring new mineral extraction operation\ns\n on stream. They cannot be switched on\n and off,\n and once \nlost\n, the industry and its support infrastructure will be very difficult to get back.\n Ener\ngy minerals are vital to the UK’s energy intensive industries’ competitive position, the recent publicity around shale gas has led to the Government saying that indigenous resources help to insulate us from supply shortages and price volatility but the sam\ne thinking does not seem to apply to coal.\n&#xa0;\nWe know that all fossil fuels require Carbon Capture and Storage as soon as practicable and are frustrated by the fact that it is now seven years since the UK’s first CCS competition was launched and so far we ha\nve not commenced any physical construction works and have spent very little of the promised £1bn for full scale demonstration of CCS.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n"
