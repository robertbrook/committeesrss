[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction[bold]The Scottish Grocers’ Federation (SGF)
[normal] 
[normal]welcomes the opportunity to respond to this important 
[normal]inquiry into tobacco smuggling. SGF is the national trade association for the Convenience Store sector in Scotland. The sector in Scotland provides upwards of 40,000 jobs across
[normal] more tha
[normal]n 5,000 Convenience Stores – there are more 
[normal]Convenience
[normal] Stores in Scotland per head of population than in the rest of the UK
[normal].
[normal]We work closely with our partner organisation in England, the Association of Convenience Stores (ACS). Several of the key points made in our submission will affirm key points from ACS’s own submission to the Committee. We will also include information specific to Scotland, which we hope the committee will find useful.
[normal]Tobacco represents an important category for 
[normal]the convenience market, and we advocate
[normal] the responsible s
[normal]ale of tobacco products through 
[normal]vigorous age verification poli
[normal]cies within our members’ stores. 
[normal]All of our members accept that tobacco must be controlled and regulated but this can only be done if tobacco products are made by legitimate manufacturers and sold by responsible retailers.
[normal]Illicit
[normal] sales of tobacco products create significant burdens to both convenience store retailers and the 
[normal]Government. 
[normal]The availability of cheap, illicit tobacco within communities harms legitimate retailers who sell products legally and in a responsible manner
[normal] through implementing age restriction policies within their stores
[normal]. Businesses not only 
[normal]lose
[normal] direct sales of tobacco to illicit traders, but also 
[normal]suffer a drop in footfall (and therefore an overall drop in sales) from
[normal] customers who stop coming into their shop
[normal].
[normal]As the Committee will be aware
[normal],
[normal] the UK Government has indicated that it will not proceed with any measures to introduce standardised packaging of tobacco products until evidence of the impact of this policy from 
[normal]Australia
[normal] can be gathered and analysed. Additionally, the Environment and Public Health Committee of the European Parliament recently voted against adopting 
[normal]measures
[normal] on standardised packaging in the revision of the European Tobacco Products Directive. However, the Scottish Government has indicated that it intends 
[normal]to press ahead with its own plans to int
[normal]roduce standardised packaging. W
[normal]e have a strong concern that this will simply be a boost to the illegal trade.
[normal] Evidence from empty pack surveys suggests that currently about 13% of tobacco products used in Scotland are illicit in one form or another. It is vital that this problem is not exacerbated through ineffective policies such as standardised packaging. Additionally such a measure is likely to create a problem of cross border smuggling within the UK. A wider issue the Committee may wish to consider is whether or not the Scottish Government has the power to legislate for these measures.
[normal]As operational targets for tobacco seizure have been missed in 2012-13, priority should instead be given to growing activity and regul
[normal]ation against the illicit trade to avoid undermining the progress already made by the Government and legitimate retailers to lower the number 
[normal]of smokers and to ensure that underage children cannot
[normal] access these products
[normal].
[normal] Illicit traders target those living in lower-income areas, particularly children, who are not only attracted by the lower price of illicit products, but also by the
[normal] ease of access to them, owing to a
[normal] lack of age restriction enforced by this market. 
[normal]  
[normal]Why Border Force failed to meet its operational targets for tobacco seizure in 2012–13[bold]Although HMRC has made significant progress in tackling the illicit trade at UK borders, the lack of focus on the growth of
[normal] volume crime
[normal] on the ground in communities has meant that inland illicit activity has been able to thrive 
[normal]in our most vulnerable communities, and has contributed to the failure of HMRC t
[normal]o reach its operational targets in 2012-13. 
[normal] 
[normal]This is evident from HMRC’s own statistics on prosecutions. 
[normal]The proportion of prosecutions for inland seizures compared with those on the border and overseas is extremely low, and targets have also been missed in this area. 
[normal] For instance, o
[normal]nly 5% of cigarettes seized in 2010-2011 and 14% of Hand Rolling Tobacco were seized inland
[normal].
[normal]Government-led responsibility for ta
[normal]ckling smuggling lies with HMRC; however
[normal] local agencies have the network and the people to identify illegal tobacco sales in the community
[normal], particularly in the case of low-level volume crime
[normal]. There are currently limite
[normal]d links between these agencies, and
[normal] there is a pressing need for a more 
[normal]co-ordinated
[normal] approach between local and national enforcement. Clear responsibilities should be outlined for Trading Standards and local police in this area; they should not serve as merely a supporting partner of HMRC. 
[normal]Whether the current sanctions and penalties for tobacco smuggling are appropriate[bold]The Committee may find it useful to know that since 2011 anyone who wishes to sell tobacco in Scotland must be registered on the Scottish Government’s Tobacco Retail Register – the scheme currently has approximately 11,000 registered sellers. SGF’s members have on the whole been very positive about the register – they are willing to be seen as responsible and legitimate retailers. A key factor in the high levels of registration is that there is no charge attached to registering and it can be done through a fairly simple on-line proce
[normal]ss.
[normal]There are serious consequences for retailers who are not in compliance with the new smoking legislation. The Tobacco and Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Act 2010 gives powers to Trading Standard Officers to issue fixed penalty notices for offences, including selling tobacco to under 18s and not being on the Retailer Register. If a retailer is found to be in breach of tobacco sales legislation three times within a two year period, a Local Authority can apply to the courts to have the retai
[normal]ler banned from selling tobacco.
[normal]For the first time under tobacco sales laws, those found to be selling tobacco illicitly by not being on the Register can be fined up to £20,000 and sent to prison for six months. Scotland is the only nation of the UK to have such a scheme in place. The registration scheme gives a wider range of tools to Trading Standards which will help them in enforcing age restriction laws. However, we have a concern that offences against the scheme are not being prosecuted with sufficient force
[normal] possibly due to a lack of resources on the ground as public spending continues to be cut back.
[normal] 
[normal]Our understanding is that in 2011-2012 there were no prosecution for offences relating to the Register.
[normal]As with our colleagues from 
[normal]ACS
[normal], we believe
[normal] that current sanctions against tobacco smugglers, particularly those who operate on the ground within communities, are not strong enough and do not target the correct people. Current activities, such as the use of UK Duty ‘fiscal mark’ detector and banning orders do not target illicit traders who trade in locations 
[normal]such as vans and tab houses, but instead 
[normal]impose further regulatory burdens on legitimate retailers.
[normal]In addition to 
[normal]addition
[normal]al resources for Trading Standards and local police to be able to bring action against illicit tobacco traders, new and harsher penalties to deter these sellers should also be introduced. 
[normal]T
[normal]he current structure of sanctions is counter-pro
[normal]ductive and needs to be tackled.
[normal] 
[normal]Current
[normal] sanctions
[normal] are also 
[normal]too complicated and time-consuming for HMRC to pursue. 
[normal]A suite of new and easy to administer penalties targeted at sellers of smuggled tobacc
[normal]o products should be introduced, including:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We hope the Committee will find this submission helpful. We would be very willing to engage further with the Committee in whichever way is most useful.
