"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by HM Government (GSH0015)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;RESPONSE TO THE COMMITTEE’S QUESTIONS&#xa0;How do Government departments make use of horizon scanning?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nStrategy development&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n              \na.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \n‘\nFuture of Food and Farming\n’\n (2011\n)\n report took a multidisciplinary approach to examine the unsustainable consumption of \nglobal \nnatural resources and the ‘hungry billion’ in the global food system. The report \nis being used by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs \nin support of \naction to open up global markets, to manage volatility of food prices, to combat and to adapt to the challenges posed by climate change, protecting the world’s resources and biodiversity, and to incorporate sustainable practices in agri\nculture production, \nfor example, in preparation for Rio +20 and in negotiating the Common Agricultural Policy Reform\n. \nThe Foresight \nproject’s conclusions on the need for sustainable intensification of agriculture in the UK pr\novided a comprehensive evidence-\nbase for, and endorsement of, the department’s \n‘\nGreen Food Project\n’\n which examined how we might increase food production in England, whilst simultaneously enhancing the environment.\n&#xa0;\nb.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \n‘\nFuture of Computer Trading in Financial Markets\n’\n (2012) interim report in 2011 \nplayed an influential role in informing the European Commission about \nthe impact that high frequency trading had on financial markets\n, specifically, in the drafting of the \n‘\nMarkets in Financial Instruments Directive\n’\n which will support the development of European regulation\n;\n&#xa0;\nc.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \n‘\nTackling Obesity: Future Choices\n’\n (2007) report h\nas achieved an enduring impact on a number of health\n sector\n programmes\n, including \n‘\nHealthy Weight: Healthy Lives: a cross-government strategy for England\n’\n. The \nForesight \nreport was also influential in informing the launch of the Department of Health’s 2011\n approach to public health and obesity, \n‘\nHealthy Lives, Healthy People: A call to action on obesity in England\n’\n where the Government set national ambitions to achieve a sustained downward trend in the level of excess weight in children by 2020, and a downward trend in the level of excess weight averaged across all adults by 2020. The strategy drew on, among other sources, the models in the Foresight report which projected rates of obesity in 2050 if trends continued \nunchecked\n and more recent analysis (2011) which\n modelled obesity rates in 2030; and\n&#xa0;\nd.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nForesight played a pivotal role in driving the £55 million Government investment in novel diagnostic technologies. Its \n‘\nInfectious Diseases\n’\n (2006) \nreport and subsequent follow up work provided the scientific analysis, business insight, and rationale for the Technology Strategy Board’s \n‘\nDetection and Identification of Infectious Agents Innovation Platform\n’\n in partnership with the Department of Health and the Department for Environment, Food and R\nural Affairs.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\na.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Government’s \n‘\nIndustrial Strategy\n’\n is a long term partnership with business, which applies across the whole of Government and gives business the confidence to invest. The partnership between Government and Industry includes the formation of Sector Councils that are co-chaired by Ministers and Industry leaders. Each sector has recently published a strategy document that develops a shared vision for the future of \nthe industry and an action plan to get there. Each Sector Council analysed its sector\n,\n paying particular attention to future technologies, skills, and market trends, among others;\n&#xa0;\nb.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe\n ‘\nGlobal Strategic Trends Review\n’\n produced by the Ministry of Defence’s \nDevelopment, Concepts, and Doctrine Centre\n. \nThe Review is \nused to underpin the National Security Strategy and will also be used to inform the Strategic Defence and Security Review in 2015;\n&#xa0;\nc.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn 2011, Government published \nthe\n \n‘\nWhite Paper on the Natural Environment\n’\n, the first in 20 years. The paper \nreceived \ninput from across \ng\novernment\n, including the use of horizon scanning\n. \nT\nhe National Ecosystem Assessment\n, a key piece of horizon scanning-based evidence, played a\n substantive role in the white paper\n as it\n provided an assessment of the UK’s natural environment and a future ass\nessment of how it will change;\n&#xa0;\nd.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nForesight’s \n‘\nFuture Flooding\n’\n (2004) significantly influenced the development of the Government’s 20-year strategy for flood risk management\n \n‘\nMaking Space for Water\n’\n (2005)\n, \n‘\nThe Pitt Review\n’\n (2008), and the Environment Agency’s \n‘\nThames Estuary 2100 Plan\n’\n (2012);\n&#xa0;\ne.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Government Chief Scientific Adviser’s \n‘\nScience and Engineering Assurance Review\n’ (2011)\n of the Department for International Development\n recognised the department’s use of scientific advice in \nhorizon scanning as good practice. The report supported the various sources of (internal and external) advice to horizon scan future, science-related threats and opportunities, including via the Chief Scientific Adviser and his Office, the Chief Economist and his Office, the Senior Research Fellows network and the independent Research Advisory Group, chaired by Professor Sir Leszek Borysiewicz\n;\n&#xa0;\nf.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Government’s\n ‘\nActive Travel\n’\n work, led by the Department of Transport \nworking closely with the \nDepartment of Health, has been developed through regular engagement with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Ministry of Justice, the Department for Education, and the Department for Communities and Local Government; in particular to ensure an ongoing dialogue about all aspects of cycling and wider active travel policy. These discussions have been informed by horizon scanning to consider the technological and economic factors (such as increasing use of electrical vehicles and peak oil) that are likely to shape urban str\neetscapes over the coming years;\n&#xa0;\ng.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Pension Commission published three reports between 2004 and 2006 \nwhich \nhave been \nvery influential \nin \npensions thinking. The first report of the Pensions Commission set out a detailed and comprehensive analysis of the UK pension system over the long term, which went on to underpin the recommendations made in the second report\n;\n&#xa0;\nh.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nHorizon Scanning Centre’s report on Technology and Innovation Futures (2012) informed negotiations for the science spend in the Autumn Budget Statement, and the Department of Business, Innovation and Skill’s \n‘\nEight Great Technologies\n’\n \nwork\n;\n&#xa0;\ni.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affair’s \nnew \n‘\nEvidence Investment Strategy\n’\n is currently being developed and has used an analysis of horizon scanning sources along with input from policy makers, evidence specialists and independent experts to identify key strategic challenges for the department. This will ensure \nthe department’s\n evidence strategy takes a comprehensive and strategic view of evidence needs, and accounts for em\nerging opportunities and risks\n;\n&#xa0;\nj.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Department of Energy and Climate Change’s \n‘\nCarbon Plan\n’\n is a cross-government assessment which sets out how the UK will achieve decarbonisation within the framework of its energy policy.\n The plan contains a range of possible future scenarios for the UK, based on analysis of the technical and economic potential of different abatement options. The department’s UK Energy Projects underpin the plan, setting out how we expect energy supply and demand\n to evolve between now and 2030; and\n&#xa0;\nk.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Department for Culture, Media and Sport is engaging actively with O\nfcom\n, industry and academics to develop a digital communications infrastructure strategy\n from 2015 to 2025. In parallel, and contributing to the infrastructure strategy, the department is developing the \n‘\nUK Spectrum Strategy\n’\n to set out how we can achieve best value from use of the radio spectrum to 2025 and beyond.\n&#xa0;Policy Making&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\na.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nDepartment of Health\n has an evidence-based programme of policies and actions on public health underpinned by an analysis of trends over 20 years. This draws on evidence \nboth at the domestic level and as part of international collaborations, such as with the World Health Organization\n. \nThe\n programme, supported by horizon scanning, includes national ambitions to reduce smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, and harmful use of alcohol, with corresponding metrics included in the \n‘\nPublic Health Outcomes Framework\n’\n to track progress.\n In relation to alcohol, for example, the Department of Health has funded the University of Sheffield’s School of Health and Related Research to model the effect of public health interventions. A version of this model has also been endorsed by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.\n&#xa0;\nb.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe reports produced by the Pensions Commission made the recommendation for all employees to be automatically enrolled into a workplace pension. The Department for Work and Pensions began the implementation of Automatic Enrolment in 2012\n;\n&#xa0;\nc.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Department for Education make use of horizons scanning to help understand demographic, economic and social trends and their implications for the education system. Understanding the external environment affects how many early education school and post-16 places are required, how many teachers are needed and where to build schools. The department has developed models to anticipate and understand future trends. As well as being used for funding purposes, pupil projections help the department to determine teacher numbers and future teacher training needs\n;\n&#xa0;\nd.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Department of Energy and Climate Change’s \n‘\nFuture of Heating\n’\n plan takes forecasts of likely future heat demand in the UK and considers the different technologies that could meet this demand, and how specific barriers to deployment could be addressed\n;\n&#xa0;\ne.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn addition to carrying out strategic horizon scanning, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affair’s futures capacity includes policy-level bespoke scanning. For example, the \n‘\nGreen Food Project\n’\n used horizon scanning to explore the steps necessary for the UK to achieve a successful green food scenario. The department’s noise team used pre-existing environmental scenarios to identify and evaluate the impact of future drivers of c\nhange on the noise environment; and\n&#xa0;\nf.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nForesight’s \n‘\nMental Capital and Wellbeing\n’\n report was a major driver for the inclusion of mental wellbeing in Medical Research Council’s \n‘\nResearch Changes Lives - MRC Strategic Plan 2009-2014\n’\n and set the context for the Assisted Living Innovation Platform being run by Technology Strategy Board. The findings of the report also influenced the Department for Health’s 2011 mental health strategy \n‘\nNo Health Without Mental Health: A Cross Government Strategy for England\n’\n.\n&#xa0;\nOperational Delivery&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\na.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Department for Transport uses modelling of population projections with detailed evidence on trips made by different household types for various journey purposes, plus transport costs and efficiency proj\nections to forecast road demand;\n&#xa0;\nb.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Home Office actively uses horizon scanning to provide advice to law enforcement agencies. For example, it has recently set up a Crime Reduction Hub \nwhich will build links with academics, industry and others to analyse crime trends.\n&#xa0;\nc.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Department for Education use\ns\n modelling to produce projections on pupil numbers, future teacher training needs based on economic conditions and to determine spec\nific funding requirements;\n&#xa0;\nd.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Ministry of Justice has carried out horizon scanning activities to identify the key drivers of civil and family justice workload and used this information to create models to estimate future demand for Ministry of Justice services; and\n \n&#xa0;\ne.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Department of Health\n uses modelling of future scenarios \nin a number of areas, including using modelling to identify\n the major risk factors for non-communicable diseases. For example, modelling underpins the Government’s national ambitions to achieve sustained downward trends in overweight and obesity in England. This draws on modelling such as the work by the Government Office for Science (2007) proj\necting rates of obesity in 2050\n and more recent analysis (2011) m\nodelling obesity rates in 2030.\n Another example is the NHS Health Checks programme (commissioned by Local Authorities) which is based on extensive modelling work undertaken by the department in 2008/9. This modelling has shown that the programme has the potential to detect at least 20,000 cases of diabetes or kidney disease earlier, allowing individuals to better manage and improve quality of life. It could also prevent 1,600 heart attacks and strokes a year. Ongoing horizon scanning for this programme will be taken forward by an expert group set up by Public Health England to advise on scientific developments, research and evaluation needs.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Devolved Administrations&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDrawing in new insights through stakeholder engagement&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nInternational Engagement&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow effective is horizon scanning in Government?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nImproving the effectiveness of cross-government horizon scanning&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDo Ministers and senior officials consider horizon scanning outputs appropriately?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhat changes could be made to improve existing horizon scanning activity?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWill the recommendations made in Jon Day’s review of cross-government horizon scanning capability address current shortcomings?
