[[[Background]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;BAcC members support the health and wellbeing of people across the UK, giving over 2.3 million treatments a year. &#xa0;This year the BAcC gained accreditation from the Professional Standards Authority (PSA – formerly the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence) as part of our continued efforts to strengthen the regulation of acupuncture. &#xa0;There is scope for an improved mix of services providing care for people with long term conditions – in particular using professional therapists such as acupuncturists, so that more people are treated outside hospital. British Acupuncture Council acupuncturists are degree level trained and provide services within local NHS and social care services. &#xa0;Commissioners need to design services which promote such community-based care. BAcC Acupuncturists can treat multi-morbidities and the patient as a person rather than focusing on individual conditions. Patients with long term conditions treated by BAcC Acupuncturists are offered personalised services that should be recognised.&#xa0;It is recommended that NHS contract and commissioning mechanisms such as QOF and QUIPP recognise long term conditions. Service specifications should recognise Acupuncture to support people with long term conditions.&#xa0;Pilots should be established to test models of improving practice.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
