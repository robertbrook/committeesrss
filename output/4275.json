"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Natural Environment Research Council (IPC0036)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Question 1:  How robust are the conclusions in the AR5 Physical Science Basis report?  How much scope is there to question of the report’s conclusions? &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQuestion 2:  Have the IPCC adequately addressed criticisms of previous reports?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQuestion 3:  To what extent does AR5 reflect the range of views among climate scientists?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQuestion 4:  Can any of the areas of the science now be considered settled as a result of AR5’s publication, if so which?  What areas need further effort to reduce the levels of uncertainty?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQuestion 5:  How effective is AR5 and the summary for policymakers in conveying what is meant by uncertainty in scientific terms?  Would a focus on risk rather than uncertainty be useful?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQuestion 6:  Does the AR5 address the reliability of climate models?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQuestion 7:  Has AR5 sufficiently explained the reasons behind the widely reported hiatus in the global surface temperature record?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQuestion 8:  Do the AR5 Physical Science Basis report’s conclusions strengthen or weaken the economic case for action to prevent dangerous climate change?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQuestion 9:  Is the IPCC process an effective mechanism for assessing scientific knowledge?  Or has it focussed on providing a justification for political commitment?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
