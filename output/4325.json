"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from\n John Trueman (CYS 093)\n&#xa0;\nThis submission comprises\n \np\nersonal observations from cycle touring in England and Wales\n,\n June-\nSeptember\n 2013\n.\n&#xa0;\nItem 1 is general. Items 2-\n9\n concern inter-town cycling. Items 1\n0\n-1\n4\n concern in-town cycling.\n Item 1\n5\n addresses the particular idea of time-sharing some roads.\n&#xa0;\nSummary\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nGeneral\n1. UK drivers are \nmuch more\n considerate of cyclists\n \nthan are their counterparts in \nCanberra or Sydney\n. \nMy observations suggest that where\n \nproblems\n \nexist \nthey stem from inappropr\niate infrastructure\n not driver\n or rider\n attitu\nd\nes\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nCycling \nOut of town\n2. The basic road network\n of the UK\n is set up for motor vehicles only. This \nmay\n be because 20th century road engineers did not \nconsider\n bicycles a legitimate form of transport\n and did not \ntake\n them \ninto account \nwhen designing the roads\n. Whatever the reason, the challenge now is to retro-fit the network to accommodate not only \nconventional \nbicycles but other emerging \nlight vehicle technologies\n, of which there are several\n, l\nong-t\nerm d\nependence on cars \nbeing\n unsustainable.\n&#xa0;\n3. Motorways and trunk A-roads are ideally placed for long-distance \nlight vehicle\n travel but are not open to\n \nor are incompatible with cycling. This is unfortunate as even your longest inter-city distances are qu\nite short. \nLondon to Bristol, for example, could take a day\n by pedal cycle\n. \nW\nith the existing \ninfrastructure\n it takes three days. The road reserves for M- and trunk- \nroad\ns\n are plenty wide enough to \naccommo\ndate a cycle path\n on one side\n, yet very few\n such ro\nads\n \ndo.\n I hear the original Severn Crossing is nearing the end of its life\n,\n \nand \ny\net the Second Severn Crossing makes no provision\n at all\n for cycles or light vehicles. If the \nM48\n Severn Bridge were to close the cycling distance from \nLondon\n to Cardiff would \nbe increased by \na day\n.\n&#xa0;\n4. \nMost\n \nA-roads\n \nbetween\n towns\n, especially those with one\n-\n and two\n-\ndigit road numbers,\n \nare too dangerous for cycling. Many \nrun\n in narrow road corridors with scarcely room for two lanes of motor traffic. Retro-fitting \nthese \nwould \ninvolve widening the corridor\n or at least flattening and paving the verge\n. Whether that \nwould be\n \nan \nappropriate\n thing to do\n should depend on local factors\n, for example\n, on\n whether there is a nearby\n alternative \nro\nute\n that bicycles could use\n. \nNot all roads need \nto \nbe \nmade \ncyclable\n, just as not all laneways need be wide enough for HGVs. \nVarious significant tourist sites, for example Stonehenge, \nSilbury\n Hill and the Kennett Long Barrow, cannot \nat present\n \nbe accessed safely by \nbi\ncycle, yet minor m\nodificati\nons to short sections of A-road\n \nare all that \nis\n needed\n.\n&#xa0;\n5. \nMost B-roads out of town are safe for cycling\n, chiefly\n bec\nause the traffic is lighter\n. \n(\nExceptions \noccur. For example the B4455 Fosse Way through Warwickshire is as dangerous as \nm\nany A-ro\nad\ns\n.\n)\n \nHowever, so\n few people ride between towns that motorists \ndo not expect to come\n across a cyclist. \nThe safety of \nB-roads and ‘minor’ A-roads would \nimprove if\n more cyclists \nused\n them.\n&#xa0;\n6. \nMany \ntowns\n are linked not only by an A- or B-road but also by unc\nlassified roads. \nSuch\n roads\n \ntend to be narrow \nand \nare \nslow enough for motor vehicles and bicycles to co-exist \nsafely\n.\n These indirect \nroutes are \nreadily \ncyclable\n \nand pleasant\n to ride on. \nI\nn hilly country\n, however, there \nmay be \nonly one road\n between two \ntowns\n, and if \nthat\n \nhappens to be\n a\n \n‘\nfast\n’\n A-road\n there is no safe cycle route\n. \n&#xa0;\n7\n. \nUK \nI\nnte\nr-town distances are very short and\n well within the \ncapabilities of any cyclist. There ought to be much more local\n-\narea cycling than I \nobserved\n. Without\n some \ninter-t\nown cycling infrastructure, \nhowever\n, this is not going to happen. \nThere are many \nplaces where \nsimple, cheap and effective inter-town cycling infrastructure\n \ncould be installed\n. \nThe design has to suit cycling, \nthough\n, and not be tokenistic. On-road lanes are\n far more useful than off-road constructions that twist and turn, start and stop, go up kerbs, have walk-only sections, and so on (see 1\n4\n).\n \nSome rural sections of main road have a pedestrian path alongside, although it is often neglected and overgrown. Suc\nh paths if cleared and maintained could be easily \nadapted\n to pedestrian plus cycle use.\n&#xa0;\n8\n. Linked-up-\nness\n is extremely important to \nthe \nsafety\n of \na\n cycle network\n. \nA single \nim\n-passable junction or a hundred yards of un-\ncyclable\n road can destroy an otherwis\ne useable route.  \nI \ncame across\n \nexamples\n where \none\n council has \nmade\n \na bike \nlane\n up to its boundary but the adjoining council hasn’t. \nThis sort of thing\n leaves \nthe\n inter-town cyclist high and dry.\n \nLinked-up-\nness\n needs co-operation.\n&#xa0;\n9\n. \nI\nnformation\n about \ncyclable\n \nout-of-town \nroutes\n is \nhard to come by\n. An assumption seems to be that \nall \ncyclists live locally and know \nthe\n \nlocal \nroutes. In\n particular, \nthere is lack of \nin\nformation \nabout\n which A- and B-\nroads\n are \ncyclable\n \nand which \nare not\n.\n Cycling charit\nies such as SUSTRANS \nare designing a network of \nrecommend\ned\n r\noutes\n but \nthey tend to pick the most scenic\n and meandering of \nthe\n alternatives\n. The\nir\n routes\n cover \nonly \na tiny fraction of what is \ncyclable\n while their \nmaps \nfocus\n \nchiefly \non their preferred route\ns. Some money put into \na \nmap\n of\n \ncyclable\n through routes\n,\n including routes on the A- and B- network\n,\n would be of great benefit to the touring cyclist. \nSuch \na \nmap\n could also \nhelp identify\n where short, cheap, simple improvements \nc\nould join the dots and make i\nnter-town \nand long distance \ncycling more accessible \nfor\n all.\n&#xa0;\nIn-town cycling\n10. \nRoads i\nn \nprovincial\n towns, whether nominally A-, B- or unclassified, are generally \ncyclable\n. Traffic is slow, obstacles such as parked cars, turning vehicles, pedestrians\n, \ntraffic lights, pedestrian crossings and speed bumps keep things that way, and motor traffic and bicycles can very easily co-exist.\n Motorists need to be aware that cycles have to go around drains and that sort of thing. Cyclists need to be aware that holdi\nng up a car for a few extra seconds can be very frustrating for the motorist.\n&#xa0;\n11. Cities have an extra class of road, the cross-city through route\n. It is\n the urban equivalent of a trunk road\n. These\n \nroads \nare highly dangerous\n. \nI would not cycle on them. \nTh\ne problem, as usual, is they were planned and constructed without thought to \nbicycles\n as a means of transport and they make no concessions to the needs of cyclists. Some cities have attempted to retro-fit cycle lanes but these often stop when the going get\ns tough, for example at junctions or whe\nre\n the carriageway is narrow, so \nthey \nmerely pay a token nod to cycling. \nBad retro-fits like that do not decrease the danger. \nThe road corridor, though, is often wide enough that a proper cycle route could be fitted,\n and if this were done such a route\n, whether on-road or not,\n would be safe.\n&#xa0;\n12. Road junctions are one of the least friendly aspects of cycling in towns and cities. Very many junctions have been designed without any thought to how a cyclist might negotiat\ne them. Some of the bigger roundabouts simply cannot be negotiated. \nHaving o\nne of those in a route negates the entire route. There is usually room \nto cater \nfor \nbicycles (and other light vehicles)\n if the road engineers had \nconsidered\n them.\n Where the enginee\nring has gone out of its way to make life difficult for the bike rider there \nare bound to be \nproblem\ns\n but I’ve yet to see a junction where a bike compatible design could not be implemented.\n That said, a minimally bike compatible design is not the same as a\n fair\n-\nfor\n-\nall design. I \ncame across\n one junction \nwhere \nthe\n cyclist \ni\ns expected to push seven \ncrossing buttons and wait seven times (14 minutes?) to go straight on. It’s no wonder \nsome cyclists\n \ntake their chance on\n the road.\n&#xa0;\n13. Cities and larger towns som\netimes \nhave\n mixed cycling and bus lanes. These are less than ideal \nfrom the safety angle \nsince bicycles and bu\nses are of very different sizes and have very different driv\ning characteristics: bu\nses accelerate well and cruise at 30mph but keep stopping, bicy\ncles accelerate\n poorly and \ncruise at 10-15mph\n;\n so the two kinds of vehicle in the same lane get in each other’s way. The\nse mixed lanes\n are not so much \ninherently \nunsafe as frustrating and annoying\n, but frustration and annoyance breed danger\n.\n&#xa0;\n14. Most \ntown and city \noff-road cycle lanes and joint pedestrian/cycle lanes are of limited use to cyclists\n as currently configured\n. They stop and start in unexpected ways. They are very poorly signed – only a local would kno\nw where they go. The beginnings\n \ninvariab\nly \nare \nunmarked\n for the approaching on-road cyclist\n and\n \nare \nvery easily missed\n, even impossible, sometimes, to turn into\n. The\nse off-road paths\n typically\n involve ste\nep grades and rough surfaces\n while t\nhe cyclist must\n \nstop\n to negotiat\ne\n driveways, road crossi\nngs, kerbs and the like\n and quite often is expected to get off and walk at junctions or bus stops. The\ny\n are not a serious cycling \ntransport \nalternative, except they can be a \nsafe \n‘pavement cycling’ alternative \nnear\n schools. Motorists \noften \nget annoyed when\n \na cyclist\n use\ns\n the road instead of an adjacent off-road path, but there is usually \na \ngood reason why they do.\n&#xa0;\nT\nime-sharing with HGVs\n15. \nI have \nseen\n the suggestion that certain routes in London should be time-shared. This might make cycling safer at n\non-\nHGV times but would not \nmake \nit\n safer at \nother \ntimes when the road \ni\ns still shared\n and might make it less safe if HGV and other drivers assume there will be no bicycles on the road outside of \nthe \n‘no-HGV’ times\n. These roads will be of the urban \nthrough-route class\n (my \npara\n 11)\n,\n equivalent in danger to an A-trunk road\n. \nTime-sharing ought only to be considered a stopgap solution to what is in essence a local, \nal\nthough still a very serious, problem. \nA\nny\n permanent solution \nought to\n involve reconfigur\ning the\n road\n, \nperhaps \nalong \nwith nearby parallel roads\n, to be bicycle\n/light vehicle\n compatible\n. \n&#xa0;\nDecember \n2013\n&#xa0;\n"
