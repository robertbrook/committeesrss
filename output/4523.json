"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (HCP0009)&#xa0;\nIntroduction &#xa0;\nThe CSP welcomes the o\npportunity to provide evidence f\no\nr\n the \nHealth Select Committee Accountability \nHearing with the Health and Care Professions Council\n (HCPC)\n. \n&#xa0;\nThe Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP) is the professional, educational and trade union body for the UK’s 5\n2\n,000 \nqualified\n physiotherapists, physiotherapy students and support workers.\n 97\n% of qualified physiotherapists are CSP members. \n&#xa0;\nWe have drawn upon\n our experience in the evidence we submit\n. \nWe would be pleased to supply additional information on a\nny of the points raised in our evidence\n at a later stage.\n&#xa0;\nSummary &#xa0;\nhttp://www.csp.org.uk/documents/professional-standards-authority-call-information-about-encouraging-candour-csp-response\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe CSP plays \na key role in ensuring \nhigh \nprofessional standards, setting out clear expectations of members\n in our \nCSP Code of Professional Values \nand Behaviour\n and Quality Assurance Standards\n.\n We see these as strongly underpinning the role of the HCPC, including thro\nugh advocating a patient-centred approach to professionalism.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThese underline the importance of all members taking personal responsibility for their own\n \npractice and standards\n,\n and continu\ning\n professional development (CPD)\n. They reflect\n the person-centred\n ethos of the profession\n. \nPhysiotherapy as a discipline is centred on the person, taking into account the totality of an individual’s health and wellbeing, in hospital, home and work settings. \nIn addition they \nemphasise the \nsupervisory\n \nresponsibilities of \nqualified\n \nphysiotherapists.\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe CSP Code of Professional Values and Behaviour and Quality Assurance Standards\n form part of core reference materials for the CSP’s team of professional advisers who support members in their practice. \n&#xa0;\n1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMore broadly, the CSP \nsupports the development of the UK physiotherapy profession, in ways that meet changing population, patient, service and practice needs. In particular, we do this through \ndelivering\n a quality assurance and enhancement role for pre-registration education\n, \nw\nith our resources forming curriculum guidance on which the HCPC draws in enacting its programme approval role\n;\n leading and supporting the development of physiotherapy practice\n, \nincluding through the large network of CSP-accredited professional networks run\n by members with expertise in pa\nrticular specialties and areas \nof practice\n; \nand leading and supporting the development of the profession’s evidence base.\n&#xa0;\n1.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe CSP would like to see\n the HCPC’s focus on protecting the public brought more to the fore through \nthe implementation of \na patient-centred approach across \nthe HCPC’s\n activities. This could include, for example\n,\n \nrequiring\n strengthened\n user involvement in the design, delivery and review of pre-registration education programmes.\n&#xa0;\n2.              The regulatory framework for physiotherapy &#xa0;2.1\n              \nThe C\nS\nP welcomes the HCPC approach to the regulatory framework for physiotherapy \nand the other Allied Health Professions (AHPs). For example\n, we see re-registration requirements focused on CPD as being proportionate and appropriate, including the requirements’ strong focus on professionalism and the application of on-going learning to practice in the interests of safeguarding and enhancing pat\nient care. We do not \ntherefore \nbelieve that a system of revalidation\n,\n \nas being introduced for other professions by other regulators\n,\n is required. \nT\nhe \nlow \nnumber\n of fitness to practice cases heard by HCPC is evidence of \nthe\n effectiveness\n of current arrangem\nents\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nThe CSP support\ns\n the \nintroduction of a\n strengthened professional responsibility for candour for \nindividual\n registrants\n, and the resp\nonse that we have made to the 2012 Law Commission review is relevant to this submission\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.3\n              \nWe support the expectation of this being taken forward by professional regulators together, to ensure a consistent and clear approach is taken to how this responsibility is couched across all health and social care professions. \nThis is \nin line with our res\nponse to the Professional Standard Authority’s consultation on the issue earlier this year\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.\n4\n              \nThe CSP has been proactive in updating web resources and support materials, \nincluding CPD support on issues of professional\nism\n and regulatory professionals in light of Francis. \n&#xa0;\n2.\n5\n              \nThe CSP is\n well placed to play a lead role in \nensuring that \na strengthened responsibility for c\nandour is fully incorporated into professional standards, and applied to practice and behaviour. We \nlook\n forward to working with the HCPC \nto \ntake this forward\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.\n6\n              \nThe CSP is aware of certain areas for improvement in how fitness to practice arrangements work. For example there is a need to bring down waiting times for hearings, both for the sake of the \nmembers of the public involved, and the registrants who may be unable to practice while they are waiting for a case to be heard.  Additionally there are concerns that the initial investigation process isn’t always sufficiently robust, leading to potential \ndifficulties at fitness to practice hearings. The CSP would be keen to work with the HCPC to improve overall the fitness to pract\nice arrangements to ensure they\n work better for the public and are fairer to registrants. \n&#xa0;\n2.\n7\n              \nThere were regular meetings between professional bodies, trade unions and the HCPC regarding fitness to practice arrangements in the past which provided an opportunity to explore any issues of concern or ways of improving\n the process for both the public an\nd registrants. Returning to this approach would benefit all.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n8\n              \nThe model of the HCPC being a regulator of a \nrange of \nprofessions works well, with advantages deriving from its cross-professional approach, \nwhich is \nstrongly in the public interest.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;3.1\n              \nOverall the CSP works well with the HCPC. However\n,\n engagement is inconsistent across the different parts of the HCPC\n. \n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nIn its final response to the Francis Inquiry the \nG\novernment announced an intention \nthat \nliaison\n should be strengthened\n between \nthe royal colleges and the GMC. \nThe CSP \nrecommends that this should be \napplied in the same \ntimeframe \nto \nthe HCPC and all \nthe \nbodies\n for the professions that it regulates\n. \n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nMaking the relationship more systematic \ncould be helped by the development of a user forum\n. It would also be helpful to re\ninstate\n the previous use of \nprofessional liai\nson groups that the HCPC organis\ned in the past\n, as a way of formalising appropriate input \nfrom \nprofessional bod\nies\n of othe\nr\n organisations to \nHCPC\n developmental and review work. \nWe recommend that such \napproaches \nwould make it possible for the HCPC to make better use of the expertise and experience of professional bodies.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember\n 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.csp.org.uk/professional-union/professionalism/csp-expectations-members/code-professional-values-behaviour\n \nhttp://www.csp.org.uk/publications/quality-assurance-standards\n \nhttp://www.csp.org.uk/documents/law-commission-review-regulation-healthcare-professionals-csp-response\n \nhttp://www.csp\n.org.uk/documents/professional-standards-authority-call-information-about-encouraging-candour-csp-response\n&#xa0;\n"
