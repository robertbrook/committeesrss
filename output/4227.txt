[[[ from the Science and Technology Committee]]]

[[[ (SCE0026)]]]This memorandum sets out some of the ways in which the Committee has sought to improve its functions since the Liaison Committee began inquiring into Committee effectiveness.  A number of changes in the way the Committee has approached its work have evolved from both an awayday and from the recommendations of  the Liaison Committee report. 

[[[Committee Away day]]]The Committee, as part of its Valley of Death inquiry, visited the Warwick Manufacturing Group facility in Coventry.  They were offered the opportunity to use a boardroom there as a base for considering the work of the Committee and how it could operate more effectively.On 16 July 2012 the Committee accepted the recommendations of the Members who attended the away day.  These recommendations have been reproduced as Appendix 1 to this paper.  A number of these have been progressed while others have not.  

[[[Liaison Committee report]]]The Liaison Committee, on 8 November 2012, published its report into select committee effectiveness.  The report contained a number of recommendations for Committees that may contribute to improving effectiveness.  These recommendations are reproduced in the Appendix. They include comments on how committees arrange their work programme, changes to reports, and training for committee members.  The Science and Technology Committee, in January this year, considered how it wished to incorporate these suggestions into its work:The Committee had a brief discussion on these issues and decided that they were content with the current working practice of the Committee.  They had no strong feelings on the recommended formatting and that they were content to follow the recommendations for conclusions and recommendations in reports.

[[[Appendix 2 – Liaison Committee Recommendations ]]]1.               Our Committee has asked the Procedure Committee to consider whether members wishing to leave a committee could be counted as discharged, even if it means that the lack of an applicant leaves a vacancy on the committee. We reiterate the concern we expressed in the last Parliament about the size of select committees and support the Wright Committee's recommendation that the size of departmental committees should not normally be more than 11 members. (Paragraph 29)2.              We encourage other committees to make use of the support of the Scrutiny Unit and to discuss with the National Audit Office how its programme of work might help support the work of the committee. (Paragraph 42)3.              As a model of "best practice", we recommend that committees:4.              We expect Government departments to be transparent about their objectives, and we ought to practise what we preach. We commend to other committees the practice of publishing strategic objectives, and of consulting their department and other stakeholders on them. (Paragraph 66)5.              We recommend that, before they launch an inquiry, committees agree a comprehensive minute setting out what they hope to achieve, and the likelihood of success. (Paragraph 69)6.              We recommend that in future inquiries, as a matter of routine, committees include consideration of the financial aspects and implications of the policies being examined. This could include for instance, what the justification for spending public money is, what evidence there is that it will offer, or is offering, good value for money to the taxpayer, what alternatives have been considered and whether they would be likely to be more effective, and the outcomes expected to be added to or improved upon by the spending. (Paragraph 72)7.              We encourage committees to hold evidence sessions at least annually with ministers and departmental accounting officers, and include within these sessions consideration of how departments evaluate and take decisions on spending, and how they assess the effectiveness of the spending they undertake. (Paragraph 73)8.              We encourage committees to review departments' Mid-Year Reports when published, using them to identify relevant issues and questions relating to finance and performance. (Paragraph 74)9.              We recommend that committees experiment with different approaches, such as appointing a rapporteur to lead on a particular inquiry, or choosing "lead questioners" for an evidence session. (Paragraph 76)10.              We recommend that committees make every effort to broaden their range of witnesses, and to take into account the principles of diversity and inclusion in planning their inquiries and committee programme. (Paragraph 77)11.              Committees should bear in mind the option of commissioning research when planning their long-term strategies, and, if necessary, the House authorities should increase the money available for this purpose. (Paragraph 78)12.              We encourage committees to keep their reports short and accessible, and to avoid too many recommendations. A clear indication of which recommendations are most important will help the committee achieve impact and make follow-up easier. We recommend that the usual template for committee reports be changed to distinguish clearly the recommendations targeted at the Government. We suggest that conclusions should be in bold, with recommendations in bold italics, and that it should be clearly stated to whom the recommendation is addressed. (Paragraph 79)13.              We recommend that each committee should appoint a member of staff, or an adviser, or an outside body, who will monitor follow-up to recommendations in respect of each report. The committee should report to the House at least once in each parliamentary Session upon how many of its recommendations the Government has acted, and what follow-up is proposed on outstanding recommendations. (Paragraph 83)14.              It is sensible for departmental select committees to be able to cross departmental boundaries when this is in the interest of effective scrutiny of matters which go beyond a single department, but they should do so in ways which respect the role of other departmental select committees and in full consultation with the chairs of those committees. (Paragraph 84)15.              We recommend that the introductory briefings offered to new committee members be given more formality, and include a meeting with the chair or another experienced committee member. When there is significant turnover following a reshuffle, for example, a programme of collective briefings for new committee members should be arranged. (Paragraph 96)16.              We recommend that committees consider the benefits of using professional trainers to help them refresh and develop their questioning skills. (Paragraph 97)17.              We recommend that chairs discuss with their committee how they see their role, and seek their endorsement for it. At this stage in the Parliament, there may be benefit in chairs asking their committees for individual feedback on their chairmanship, as an aid to the chair's professional development and to encourage committee engagement.
