"Written evidence submitted by Promega UK Ltd (FSS042)&#xa0;\nDoes the Government have an effective strategy for forensic science in the UK and is it sufficient to support forensic science R&amp;D and criminal justice?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNOTE: This list is not intended to be definitive and other chemistries may also be in use in these countries\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nFrance \nis\n currently using \nPowerPlex \n18D for database samples and \nPowerPlex \n21 for casework.  Spain will be implementing\n PowerPlex\n Fusion in the near future for casework and database samples. Belgium is already using \nEuropean \nNGC \nSTR\n systems and are considering moving to a global kit\n (such as PowerPlex Fusion or GlobaFiler)\n in the near future. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDeclaration of interests:\nThe Authors are employed by Promega UK, a supplier of reagents to the forensic community and a competitor to Life Technologies, the current sole supplier of STR Chemistry loadable to the National DNA Database.  \n&#xa0;\nReferences\n [1]  \nhttp://www.npia.police.uk/en/8934.htm\n \n Accessed 3rd Jan 2013\n[2] P.
