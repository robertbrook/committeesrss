defaultWitness:
default 
defaultStephen Greendefault, 
defaultpreferred candida
defaultte for Chair of the Office for L
defaultegal Complaints
default, gave evidence. 
defaultQ1 default&#xa0; 
defaultRt Hon Sir Alan Beith (Chair)default:default Mr Green, welcome. You come to us as the preferred candidate for the chair of the Office for Legal Complaints and we are glad to have you with us this morning. It is the second time in our history that we have carried out interviews for this particular post. We did so for the previous post
default&#x2011;
defaultholder
default,
default who did two terms of office in that position. You have had a very interesting and varied career. What aspects of your previous career do you think are relevant to the role that you now propose to take up?
defaultStephen Greendefault: I will pick out 
defaultthree things, if I may, Chair
default. First, while chairing a board— 
defaultRt Hon Sir Alan Beith (Chairdefault: default I am sorry, but I have been reminded that I have failed to do one thing. I should have asked members to declare any interests they might have. I apologise.
defaultStephen Greendefault: Indeed.
defaultAndy McDonald:default I should perhaps declare that I am a solicitor
default,
default and until November last year I was a partner with Thompsons.
defaultMr Llwyd:default I was a solicitor for 16 years and I have been a member of the Bar for 16 years.
defaultRt Hon Sir Alan Beith (Chairdefault:default I have no such interests. 
defaultJohn McDonnell:default Thank God I was not a solicitor. 
defaultMr Llwyd:default 
defaultYou just so
defaultlicit!
defaultRt Hon Sir Alan Beith (Chairdefault:default I 
defaultdo 
defaultapologise. 
defaultStephen Greendefault: I am pleased to see there is a lay majority, Chair. That does feel healthy.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ2 default&#xa0; 
defaultRt Hon Sir Alan Beith (Chairdefault)default:default 
defaultYou were about to tell us what aspects of your previous career are relevant.
defaultStephen Greendefault: Indeed. 
defaultA
defaultt the heart of chairing any board is leadership. The first thing I would put forward is that most of my professional life has been as a leader of some sort or another. I started at the age of 19
default as a second lieutenant in the A
defaultrmy. When I became a police officer, I went on to the fast
default&#x2011;
defaulttrack scheme and progressed, ultimately, to become a chief constable. I believe that I have done leadership in all of its many forms and g
defaultuises
default,
default and I think nothing could faze
default me in this role. 
defaultThat would be my first point. 
defaultSecond
defaultly
default, in my senior police role I was involved in a range of national policy issues. Most notably in the roads policing area, I was involved in the creation, development and implementation of a number of significant initiatives
default. S
defaulto I 
defaultbelieve that I 
defaultam very well acquainted with working at the national level and delivering something real and tangible that makes a difference to people’
defaults lives. 
defaultThe third thing is that when I retired from the police service I wanted to do some different things and
default,
default out of, I have to say, curiosity more than anything else
default,
default I applied to become a board member of the Legal Services Board and I have been drawn into it by inches. I have become fascinated at an intellectual level by the challenge of being an effective 
defaultmember on
default that board, but I believe that the board has made a difference in the work 
defaultthat 
defaultit has done over the last five years. I am very proud of the things it has done
default,
default but certainly, in terms of this role, it has given me a 
defaultreally 
defaultgood understanding and insight into the legal services reform agenda of the last few years
default, what it is trying to achieve
default,
default and 
defaultwhat has 
defaultand perhaps 
defaulthas not worked so well. 
defaultSo I feel I would
default come into this role with a really good knowledge o
defaultf the environment in which the 
defaultl
defaultegal 
defaulto
defaultmbudsman operates. 
defaultQ3 default&#xa0; 
defaultRt Hon Sir Alan Beith (Chairdefault)default:default 
defaultWhat is it that you are proud of that the board has done?
defaultStephen Greendefault: There are
default a number of things. The first thing I would pick out is bringing into effect independent regulation by the front
default&#x2011;
defaultline regulators. The old representative bodies wanted it to happen in practice but found it difficult to achieve on the ground. 
defaultB
defaultecause of the work the board has done
default,
default we now have lay majorities on all of the oversight boards of the regulators. We have regulation taking place independently of practice. We are policing that boundary as well. We conducted an investigation 
defaultrecently 
defaultinto one of the front
default&#x2011;
defaultline regulators and their representative arm 
defaultaround our guidance rules. S
defaulto I think we have rea
defaultlly brought independent regulation into effect. 
defaultThe second thing that I would highlight is 
defaultthat
default we have now created the regulatory structure for alternative business structures. They have perhaps not come into being as quickly as we would have liked, but we are now seeing innovative creative businesses establishing themselves
default,
default providing a service to people in different 
defaultand 
defaulthope
defaultfully 
defaultmore affordable
default ways. 
defaultThe third thing I would pick out would undoubtedly be linking to what we are talking about
default now—the establishment of the 
defaultl
defaultegal 
defaulto
defaultmbudsman. I believe I understand now that effective redress was at the heart of setting up the Legal Services Act
default.
default I think that the ombudsman, from a standing start of not existing at all to where it is now, has done a fantastic job and again is providing a real service to the public.
defaultQ4 default&#xa0; 
defaultRt Hon Sir Alan Beith (Chairdefault)default:default 
defaultBut are you sure this is a real job—the job that you have applied for and for which you are the preferred candidate? You are not the ombudsman.
defaultStephen Greendefault: 
defaultNo, but
default,
default equally
default,
default there is a need—and I think it does happen in practice—for a sort of filter through which the ombudsman’s wider policy issues need to pass. To me, the most imp
defaultortant feature of an ombudsman—
defaultparticularly in the legal world
default,
default where I think there were those 
defaultwith
default 
defaulta
default perception that it was being regulated in the interests of the profession rather than in the publi
defaultc interest—
defaultis 
defaultindependence
default, which 
defaultis critical to their success and their commanding public confidence. 
defaultI
defaultf you like, the role of t
defaulthe Office for Legal Complaints—
defaultin effect
default,
default th
defaulte board of the legal o
defaultmbudsman—
defaultis to defend that independence, to work in the wider policy environment in which it operates
default, and also to set a strategy
default, some sort of way forward, 
defaultto say, “
defaultThis is the way in which the
default service has to develop from hereon in.” 
defaultQ5 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Llwyd:default 
defaultGood morning, Mr Green. Time was when regulation was undertaken by the Law Society
default and the Bar Council
default—
defaultfull stop. We now have the Law Society
default,
default the Bar Council, the Master of the Faculties, the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives, 
defaultthe Council for Licensed Conveya
defaultncers, the Charte
defaultre
defaultd Institute of Patent Attorneys, the Institute of Trade Mark Attorneys, the Association of Costs Lawyers, the Legal Services Board
default,
default the legal services ombudsman and your good self. What is your view of the overall system of services regulation established under the 2007 Act
default,
default and how could that be improved?
defaultStephen Greendefault: 
defaultWhere does one start? The regulatory maze that David Clementi spoke of when he wrote his report in the early noughties has not gone away. 
defaultY
defaultour list—I am sure they were all there, but I did not check them off as you were saying them—demonstrates that. If you were to ask a member of the public if they understood any of that, I think they would be utterly baffled
default,
default and, to some degree, that has to be the test of whether where we are now is where we need to be. I hold to the view that
default,
default along the way
default,
default a single regulator doing all of the strands of the profession
default with the representative arms
default 
defaultdelineating the different strands would probably be a better and more sensible structure than the one that we ha
defaultve now. W
defaulthen the Act was being passed
default,
default my eyes were on other things and I did
default not really witness the debate, but my understanding is that 
defaultwhere we have 
defaultreached
default now shows the necessary compromises that had to be made at the time the Act was passed to get us to this stage. I personally do not see it as the final destination. I would be amazed if it does not develop from there.
defaultQ6 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Llwyd:default 
defaultTw
defaulto points arise, 
defaultI think. First—and I was reminded of this by the Chair in a private conversation a few minutes ago—solicitors who undertake financial services
default,
default and chartered accountants who undertake financial services
default,
default are regulated by different boards, so we have not quite finished fragmenting yet, it seems to me, but is not part of your function trying to simplify all this and makin
defaultg it accessible to the public? 
defaultGiven this information, I think most members of the public would say, “
defaultHang it, I’
defaultm not getting involved in this.
default 
defaultThere are so many different avenues.
default”
default I am not saying that the average member of
default the public is not intelligent—
defaultclearly
default, they are—
defaultbut
default,
default with all these bodies ranged across the spectrum
default,
default it is extremely complicated and confusing, is it not?
defaultStephen Greendefault: 
defaultIt is incredibly complicated and I have to say, until I start
defaulted
default doing 
defaultmy 
defaultresearch to apply for this job, I had no idea of the vast maze of ombudsman sche
defaultmes that exist in this country—
defaultschemes that exist under different statu
defaulttory bases
default, where 
defaultsome people are public sector 
defaultand 
defaultothers are private sector. 
defaultI have no idea h
defaultow on earth the public navigate their way through it. I do not think that any single ombudsman, board or scheme could in some way, shape or form take sole responsibility for rationalising it. That is just not going to happen. Equally—and in fact there is a load of them 
defaultsat 
defaultnext door because I have just seen them go in—if you sit all the ombudsmen in the country together and say, “
defaultLet’
defaults 
defaultall 
defaultarrive at a consensus about how to go forward,” they are never going to do it. To me, ultimately, rationalising the landscape is a central Government policy challenge rather than an individual ombudsman scheme challenge. I believe, however, that the Office for Legal Complaints and the legal ombudsman can and should at least describe 
defaultclearly what it is that they do and
default where th
defaultose overlaps and confusions are
default so that they can help to spell out the nature of the challenge. But I 
defaultcannot
default sit here and say to you, “I am going to go to this job and make sense of all that
default,
default and
default I am going to make it rational.
default” I cannot do that. No one can do that sitting in one ombudsman scheme. 
defaultQ7 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Llwyd:default It is not inconceivable that
default there is a rationale behind all of it, but do you see part of your function as educating, in the proper sense, the public about the kind of territory we are in?
defaultStephen Greendefault: 
defaultYes. If I am stepping out of where you want 
defaultto be
default please stop me, but I think this is relevant. 
defaultL
defaultook
defaulting
default at the complaints landscape of legal services at the moment
default,
default I have real concerns 
defaultabout the number of people who—as best we know 
defaultfrom 
defaultthe figures—
defaulthaving been dissatisfied by a legal service
default,
default do not complain at all
default,
default and 
defaultalso about the number
default of people who do complain formally and get some kind of resolution
default but are not happy with it and who
default then go to the legal ombudsman. 
defaultW
defaulte have a firm, clear duty to address those numbers and 
defaultto 
defaultstart saying, “What can we do to make sure that
default,
default if people are unhappy with a legal service
default,
default they do something about it first with the firm 
defaultfrom 
defaultwho
defaultm
default they have had the service
default,
default and
default,
default if they are not happy with that resolution
default,
default 
defaultthey 
defaultthen 
defaultcome to the legal ombudsman?” 
defaultT
defaulthat is clearly our function. Where those overlaps are concerned, there 
defaultare
default a number of things we can do. In the short term—and I know that the legal ombudsman does this already—where people come to the legal ombudsman but 
defaultit is found that 
defaultwhat they are complaining about would better be dealt with by a different ombudsman, 
defaultthey
default are
default sign
defaultpost
defaulted
default to where they should go
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthey are not just told, “
defaultNo, it is not us. Go away.
default” 
defaultT
defaulthey are given a direction in which to travel to get their problem resolved. 
defaultAgain, I hear talk of creating a common ombudsman portal on the internet, but I also hear that people have been discussing that for 10 years and it has not happened yet. What is 
defaultdesperately required—
defaultand hopefully, perhaps, through the alternative dispute resolution requirement from the European Union it might
default happen—is some clear central G
defaultovernment guidance about how this landscape might be rationalised.
defaultMr Llwyd:default 
defaultThank you.
defaultQ8 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndy McDonald:default 
defaultGood morning, Mr Green. Your CV says that you have been the lead member of the Legal Services Board with responsibility for monitoring the performance of the OLC.
defaultStephen Greendefault: 
defaultIndeed.
defaultQ9 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndy McDonald:default 
defaultThe OLC chair’s job description includes setting performance standards. Can I ask you a question in two parts?
defaultStephen Greendefault: 
defaultYes.
defaultQ10 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndy McDonald:default 
defaultWhat do you think have been the main areas of strength and weakness in the handling of complaints by the legal ombudsman? Second
defaultly
default, what proposals have you for improving the operational performance of the ombudsman?
defaultStephen Greendefault: 
defaultLet us start with the strength and then talk about the weakness. The strength undoubtedly, it seems to me, 
defaultis this. I
defaultf you set up a new service for the public and you open the phone lines and say
default,
default “Ring us up,” that is an incredibly risky thing to do because you have no idea how many people are going to ring and what problems they are going to 
defaultbring. The fact, as the Chair
default said, 
defaultthat 
defaultthe last time you saw anyone from the OLC was when you d
defaultid this for the current chair
default is a testament to the fact that they have handled that set
default&#x2011;
defaultup and launch and got the service running to a very good standard without any of the kinds of problems that other services of that nature perhaps have had in th
defaulte past. So their responsiveness and
default their ability to dea
defaultl with cases in a timely manner
default is impressive and improving
default,
default and certainly it has been an area that I have taken great pleasure from
default in
default see
defaulting
default how well they have done it. 
defaultT
defaultheir weakness has been that they worked from the outset—forgive me for going round the houses
default,
default but it is important to set this background—with the sort of budgetary envelope tha
defaultt was assumed for them by the MO
defaultJ planners. 
defaultIf you look at the figures, a
defaultlthough they have consistently reduced their costs year on year and are still reducing them, our view—I am talking 
defaultabout 
defaultmy view as an LSB board member now, not as the potential chair of the OLC—is that their cost per case is still too expensive. 
defaultWhat we would like to see—
defaultand what I would like
default to do if I were made chairman—
defaultfirst 
defaultwould be
default 
defaultto capitalise
default on their strength of dealing with cases promptly and moving them through the system quickly
default,
default because 
defaultI think 
defaultthey can get even better at that. Second
defaultly, it
default would be looking at ways in which the cost per case of the system can come down. At the moment their cost per case is in the region of £1
default,9
default00 per case. If you were to look at
default the Financial Ombudsman Service, 
defaultwhich 
defaultwe did through our consumer panel 
defaultin 
defaulta recent benchmarking survey—and I realise they
default have much greater volumes—
defaultit h
defaultas 
defaulta cost of 
defaultsomewhere in the reg
defaultion of £700 per case. 
defaultAs to t
defaulthe O
defaultmbudsman
default S
defaultervices, a private company doing lots of utility
default&#x2011;
defaulttype services, their cost per case is somewhere in the region of £400 per case. 
defaultW
defaulthile I am not saying that there is an absolute definite benchmark to work to, 
defaultit
default indicates that 
defaultthe 
defaultcost per case has to come down. 
defaultHow 
defaultthat 
defaultmight 
defaulthappen
default would be
default the next question to answer. 
defaultFirst, you have to look carefully at, in effect, the ombudsman system as a conveyor belt: things start at one end, travel along it and, hopefully, there is an outcome at the end. Are there ways in which that conveyor belt can be made more efficient? Are there processes in there that have been duplicated and things that could happen more quickly than they are doing now
default? I
defaultf you can take time ou
defaultt
default,
default you can take cost out as well. 
defaultSecond
defaultly
default, I believe that there are better uses that could be made of technology. The predominant way of interfacing with the legal ombudsman service is by telephone and then somehow you have to get any documentation through the post or whatever. In these modern days
default,
default it must be possible to have more web
default&#x2011;
defaultbased transactions so that people can interface with the legal ombudsman, on the internet if they prefer it that way
default,
default and us
defaulte that to move documents around
default or whatever. 
defaultT
defaulthere are significant opportunities to be able to improve their efficiency by using IT in a smarter way that reflects modern consumer life. Would you like more or has that answered your question?
defaultRt Hon Sir Alan Beith (Chairdefault)default:default 
defaultI think we will probably cover some more of the ground as we go through 
defaultthe
default questions.
defaultQ11 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndy McDonald:default 
defaultYou have 
defaultplaced 
defaultstress
default on the benchmarking and the processing
default,
default but I do not know whether you have addressed the improving of the overall operational performance issues. 
defaultWould y
defaultou like to 
defaulttell us more about that?
defaultStephen Greendefault: 
defaultIn reality, what is ov
defaulterall operational performance? 
defaultI think it is
default,
default “Does it happen fast enough?” 
defaultB
defaulty the time they get to the ombudsman
default,
default 
defaultconsumers 
defaulthave already been through the complaints system of the law firm and they want things t
defaulto happen. 
defaultT
defaulthe first thing is
default,
default “Does it happen fast enough?” The second thing 
defaultis,
default “Is the qua
defaultlity of what is done acceptable?
default 
defaultD
defaultoes it meet the expectations of the member of the public 
defaultwho
default complains?” Third
defaultly
default, “Is the overall cost of it reasonable
default,
default bearing in mind that whatever it is that the legal ombudsman costs is a cost to your profession?” If we are working to the regulatory objectives, we would have a duty to keep that cost down as low as possible. 
defaultI believe that
default,
default by making the overall system more efficient
default,
default you will make it faster, 
defaultimprove the quality and 
defaultmake it cheaper. 
defaultC
defaultertainly
default,
default one of the things that I would want to do as the chair of the OLC board is 
defaultlose
default 
defaultthe narrative that has been pursued by the legal ombudsman so far
default, which
default has been, “We are better and cheaper than what went before.” 
defaultM
defaultemories of what went before are increasingly fading
default,
default and certainly the lead I would want to give would be to say—this is why the benchmarking is important—we now need to be seen as best in class
default,
default we need to understand what that means and chart a course towards achieving that
default,
default so that when this rationalisation take
defaults
default place, as one would hope it would, people say, “Whatever we do, we need to keep the legal ombudsman because they are the best.” 
defaultQ12 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn McDonnell:default 
defaultI am interested in your analysis about the way forward in terms of improvement
default,
default but to start the improvement process we need to be clear about what our assessment of trends is at the moment. What is your assessment of the trends with regard to the numbers and types of cases? In the reports we have received there have been predictions about quite an increase in cases
default,
default but there has 
defaultactually 
defaultbeen a decline recently.
defaultStephen Greendefault: 
defaultI could not go to the level of detail of trends in types of complaints
default,
default but certainly the trend in overall complaints is pretty flat. That has been something of a mystery to the OLC board and the legal ombudsman. This time last year they were just approving a change in their scheme rules that they believed would let more complaints in. It did not seem to have any massive
default,
default huge impact on the numbers. 
defaultIn my current role
default I have challenged about that on a number of occasions and not received a satisfactory answer. Ultimately, if I could not get a satisfactory answer, then some research 
defaultwould need
default to be done to understand that better. It has not been done yet. 
defaultW
defaulthen you look at the numbers around the lack of willingness of people out there to complain and look at the fact that the complaints levels are flat, it does leave you wonder
defaulting
default what is happening out there. One of the things that the OLC board can take on is to say, “
defaultLet’
defaults see what influence we can bring to bear on people’s willingness to complain in the first place,” and I think there are a number of things they can or could do to be able to improve that.
defaultQ13 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn McDonnell:default 
defaultThe legal ombudsman has undertaken some thematic reports.
defaultStephen Greendefault: 
defaultYes.
defaultQ14 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn McDonnell:default 
defaultDo you think the legal ombudsman can be more proactive and work in that sort of way, developing more thematic reports
default,
default and in what sort of area? 
defaultStephen Greendefault: 
defaultYes. Again, I would not like to try and fire from the hip and specify an area
default,
default but my view is this. They have put three of those reports out
default and t
defaulthey have been of good quality, founded on the evidence of their experience as an ombudsman at this stage. 
defaultIt
default is a feature of their service that they should do as much as possible of 
defaultthat, and try 
defaultto
default make it programmed and
default 
defaultsystematic, so that people know what areas are being looked at in the course of a year and 
defaultpublished
default reports are coming out. 
defaultI
defaultn addition to that
default,
default I wonder if, once they are doing that, they can capitalise on two things. One is that the Act allows the Legal Services Board to make requirements on the front
default&#x2011;
defaultline regulators about the arrangements they make for the handling of co
defaultmplaints by the legal entities—
defaultthe regulated entities. Are there synergies that can be achieved
default,
default where we can bring together the knowledge of the legal ombudsman and the Office for Legal Complaints with the powers that the LSB have to try and make some of the use of that power more focused than it currently is?
defaultJohn McDonnell:default 
defaultAt the front end.
defaultStephen Greendefault: 
defaultIn addition to that, again—and I know that the OLC do work with the front
default&#x2011;
defaultline regulators—are there ways that the information that the legal ombudsman produces can be shared more proactively with the front
default&#x2011;
defaultline regulators and used so that they can fulfil their duties to oversee 
defaultthe effectiveness of first
default&#x2011;
defaulttier 
defaultcompla
defaultints handling in a more 
defaultrisk
default and problem-focused 
defaultway than they have hitherto 
defaultbeen 
defaultable to do?
defaultQ15 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn McDonnell:default 
defaultWhat is your assessment of the desirability of extending the remit of the legal ombudsman in a voluntary sche
defaultme to cover alternative dispute 
defaultresolution providers, as proposed by the OLC report?
defaultStephen Greendefault: 
defaultIf you start from the premise that the point of the legal ombudsman service is to make the market work better for legal services consumers, the fact that there is a proportion of those consumers who are receiving legal services from non
default&#x2011;
defaultregulated providers and are unable to get redress from the legal ombudsman cannot be right. 
defaultI
defaultn terms of a policy direction, it clearly has to be a desirable thing to do. It can never be—and I want to make this clear—seen as a means of addressing the cost issue that we talked about before. We have to deal with cost independently of that, although undoubtedly it would dilute some of the overheads and things like that. 
defaultT
defaulthe OLC and LeO need to develop a proposition that they can put to the unregulated legal services to demonstrate the economic and business benefits of having access to redress
default,
default the legal ombudsman scheme
default,
default and then test that to destruction. If it is a voluntary s
defaultcheme, people have to volunteer. C
defaultertainly
default,
default if you look at the work that has been done in will writing
default,
default there is ample evidence of consumer detriment 
defaultthere
default. There must be an argument that says the world would be a better place if that could be achieved. 
defaultAnother area that interests me—and perhaps it is a 
defaultnod back
default to my former life—is a whole tranche of 
defaultpeople who are not lawyers 
defaultbut immigration advisers who are regulated by the Home Office
default,
default but there is no right of redress into the legal ombudsman. Again, 
defaulttheir clients are
default probably among some of the most vulnerable consumers that are dealt with in legal services. Finding a way of bringing those people into a voluntary scheme would be a good thing in the interests of society.
defaultQ16 default&#xa0; 
defaultRt Hon Sir Alan Beith (Chairdefault)default:default 
defaultWould you apply the same logic to claims management companies and say that they should be brought within the same framework then? Technically, they are—  
defaultStephen Greendefault: 
defaultYes, Chair. This might be naive optimism on my part—and I 
defaultgrovellingly apologise
default if it is—but it is my understanding that the legislative mechanism to overcome the difficulties in bringing in claims management companies was being overcome last week. I was certainly hearing optimistic messages in the other place. If that happens, I am hoping—and I have to say it was kind of an assumption of what I was saying earlier—that what we are then left with is an implementation project rather than a design
default of
default “How do we make this happen?”
default 
defaultproject. I think it is desirable that it should happen. There is clearly some turbulence in that market now caused by the referral fees ban
default,
default and how big it will be in a couple of years’ time remains to be seen. But for the time being it seems to me that, first, given what LeO have done so far, I would feel confident about their capability to set this thing up and make it work in a relatively short time. Hopefully, touch wood, the legislative mechanisms are now in place 
defaultto enable
default that 
defaultto
default happen
default,
default and certainly I would hope that
default,
default were you happy with what I had to say today, by the time I arrive there, things would be starting to happen to bring that into being.
defaultQ17 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn McDonnell:default 
defaultYou are a “glass half full”
default man, Mr Green, 
defaultare you not?
defaultStephen Greendefault: It is the only way to live, 
defaultsir.
defaultQ18 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Llwyd:default 
defaultFollowing on the last point from the Chair, do you have a view on the growth of what can only be called professional McKenzie friends who appear in family cases and 
defaultseem
default to be making a living with no regulation whatsoever? 
defaultStephen Greendefault: 
defaultIt is not an area in which I have had any experience or study whatsoever and I am reluctant to just fire a view from the hip.
defaultQ19 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Llwyd:default 
defaultI was not trying to trip you up. I would just like to flag it up.
defaultStephen Greendefault: 
defaultI have to say it is not an area that I am aware has raised any cases with the legal ombudsman, but it is certainly a question that, now you have asked me, I will 
defaultgo and ask 
defaultabout 
defaultit 
defaultbecause I am interested
default in it
default.
defaultQ20 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Llwyd:default 
defaultThat is exactly what I was hoping you would say. In a response to Mr McDonnell earlier you said, basically, 
defaultthat 
defaultthere is a flatlining in numb
defaulters of complaints. Could it be—God forbid—
defaultthat legal services are improving in terms of quality?
defaultStephen Greendefault: 
defaultAbsolutely.
defaultQ21 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Llwyd:default 
defaultOver the last five to 10 years there has been far more concentration on client care and quality of service
default,
default with checks on firms regularly. 
defaultStephen Greendefault: Yes. 
defaultMr Llwyd: defaultC
defaultould that be part of the answer?
defaultStephen Greendefault: 
defaultI think it absolutely could
default,
default and certainly I am aware
default,
default through my Legal Services Board work
default,
default that there is some evidence—
defaultI think it is out 
defaultwith the SRA—of falls in the numbers of complaints that have been recorded in law firms. I think it is still quite fragile evidence, but there is some indication. I wonder, quite honestly, if one of the most significant things in the chan
defaultges in arrangements made by the OLC last year wa
defaults the more proactive imposition of a case fee
default.
default There has been a change in the way that funding works so that in certain circumstances the law firm concerned is charged a case fee. I know 
defaultthis 
defaultcertainly because
default—
defaulteven though up until this I have had no direct involvement in the 
defaultrunning of the legal ombudsman—
defaultlawyers 
defaultwho
default know me from my former life have bent my ear considerably about the likelihood of getting a case fee. I think that that has hopefully, in 
defaulta
default right and ethical way, incentivised people as well to resolve their cases at first instance. 
defaultT
defaulthat can only be a good thing. 
defaultT
defaulthat tells me the extent to which
default,
default by taking measures from the legal ombudsman
default,
default you can change the way the world works down at the coal face, as it were, where the client and the lawyer actually meet.
defaultQ22 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Llwyd:default 
defaultWhat would be your priorities for the Office for Legal Complaints in the next few years? 
defaultStephen Greendefault: 
defaultI have touched on them to some degree, but let me go through them one by one. 
defaultNo. 1
default 
defaultwould be
default to say 
defaultw
defaulthat more can be done to influence the wider complaints system in general? We have just touched upon one thing, but if you look, as I say, at the unwillingness of people 
defaulteither 
defaultto complain in the first place or pursue their complaint right the way to the legal ombudsman, there must be steps that can be taken to try and improve that. I will enlarge on that in a second if you want, but I will 
defaultjust
default go 
defaulto
defaultn to the other two, if I may. 
defaultThe second would be to cover the areas that we talked about before about 
defaultw
defaulthat 
defaultwe 
defaultcan do to make the existi
defaultng system work more efficiently.
default 
defaultI
defaultmproving the e
defaultfficiency of the conveyor belt—by 
defaultlooking at the things that fall off 
defaultit in the course of its journey and
default looking at ways of making it travel thro
defaultugh faster, cheaper and quicker—is
default, again,
default an important priority. 
defaultThe third 
defaultpriority
default would be to touch 
defaultagain 
defaultupon what we have discussed already
default,
default 
defaultwhich is 
defaulttryin
defaultg to chart a course through the
default wider environment of how people who cannot get 
defaultredress
default because they get their legal service
defaults from a non
default&#x2011;
defaultregulated provider
default 
defaultbe served. T
defaulthat is all about voluntary schemes. How can people who get bundled services
default get redress? T
defaulthe famous example that is always quoted by the Legal Services Consumer Panel is a house purchase 
defaultand 
defaultth
defaulte people you have to deal with because 
defaultyou go through the jurisdiction of several different ombudsmen 
defaulton
default that journey. How
default do you know which one
default to deal with
default? H
defaultow can we make sure that people with bundled services get some kind of joined
default&#x2011;
defaultup redress? Then
default,
default also in that environment, as I said, the Government have to respond to the EU directive on
default alternative dispute resolution.
default 
defaultW
defaulte need to understand how that is moving ahead. 
defaultI think that, in reality, along
default the way
default,
default the ombudsman service and 
defaulto
defaultmbudsmen in general 
defaultwill change over the coming years. I cannot paint you a vision
default.
default 
defaultI think
default it would be foolish to say, “It needs to look like this,” but I certainly would see 
defaultit 
defaultas a priority making sure that I am in a position to lead the board to face those challenges and provide the most appropriate response from the Office for Legal Complaints.
defaultQ23 default&#xa0; 
defaultRt Hon Sir Alan Beith (Chairdefault)default:default 
defaultThere have been quite a few issues between the Legal Services Board and some of the front
default&#x2011;
defaultline regulators. Do you think the front
default&#x2011;
defaultline regulators might see you as the LSB’s man?
defaultStephen Greendefault: 
defaultI would be foolish not to think it is a risk. All I would say, Chair, is this. Anybody who thinks that I will not be independent in my role is sadly mistaken. If you look
default at my professional background, 
defaultmy culture
default and the way I have been brought up is to act independently—
defaultand I find that very easy to do. For me, while I think I offer great benefits because I under
defaultstand the Legal Services Board, 
defaultI understand how they tick, I know what buttons to push and levers 
defaultto pull—
defaultso I think that helps—
defaultI would have no difficulty in acting independently and establishing my independence as soon as I took this role on. 
defaultH
defaultopefully
default,
default you can tell that this was not a question that was unexpected to me
default, but I understand 
defaultthe importance, if I were to take up this role, of establishing the fact that I am independent and working accordingly.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ24 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn McDonnell:default 
defaultThere are two other roles we see in the job description, one of which is acting as ambassador for the OLC and the ombudsman
default,
default and the other 
defaultis 
defaultin regard to dealing with the media. On the ambassadorial role
default,
default will you do anything differently from Elizabeth France? On the media role, what experience do you have of that and will you do that somewhat differ
defaultently in this role? The Chair
default is concerned that we have a Paxman
default&#x2011;
defaultproof person appointed 
defaultin this role or it will go pear-
defaultshaped.
defaultStephen Greendefault: 
defaultCan I 
defaulttake that
default one first?
defaultJohn McDonnell:default 
defaultYes, you better had.
defaultStephen Greendefault: 
defaultI am pleased you have asked me that question because it probably shows that
default you have never g
defaultoogled me. Because I was a chief constable, I l
defaultived my life in the media and 
defaultI am very well acquai
defaultnted with dealing with them.
default I have played the part of hero and I have played the part of villain. I feel very comfortable in dealing with the media. I understand that you never control them. Every now and again you have an unholy alliance to achieve a particular end
default,
default but they are there to do a service; they are not there to be our bosom buddies and I am well used to that.
defaultQ25 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn McDonnell:default 
defaultYou had a relationship with motorway demonstrations and other things.
defaultStephen Greendefault: 
defaultYes, I did.
defaultQ26 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn McDonnell:default 
defaultHow was that?
defaultStephen Greendefault: 
defaultIt was very interesting. My determination at that time was to do things differently. I was concerned when I looked at what had happened in the past that the tactics of the demonstrators were causing huge danger to themselves and those who were there to rescue them
default,
default because
default,
default in effect
default,
default they were digging holes in the ground, concreting themselves in and defying the world to get them out. I thought that that was madness
default,
default and so I worked very closely with Ministers and the Highways Agency to create a means of foreshortening 
defaultit 
defaultall. 
defaultI
defaultn reality, other than one set-
defaultpiece eviction, we turned what had been hitherto seen as the way that environmental protests then happened completely on its head and we tried to allow lawful, peaceful protest
default;
default but
default,
default where people wanted to dig dangerous
default tunnels and lay their concrete and so on
default, we put a stop to it quickly. I felt at that time that I had no difficulty standing up in the press and making the moral, legal
default and
default professional case for doing what I was doing. While it did not make the protestors happy, the people of the west Midlands, who were paying for all of this, were very happy with what I did and we got a lot of positive feedback.
defaultQ27 default&#xa0; 
defaultRt Hon Sir Alan Beith (Chairdefault)default:default 
defaultWhat about the ambassadorial role?
defaultStephen Greendefault: 
defaultAs to the ambassadorial role, I h
defaultave known Elizabeth a long time—
defaultshe is 
defaultsitting
default behind me now so I will make sure I say nice things abo
defaultut her—and
default I think she does that well
default,
default 
defaultbut
default I firmly believe that it is not the job of the chair of the OLC in any way, shape or form 
defaultto 
defaulteclipse the legal ombudsman. The legal ombudsman is the person who is there to be at the front end of commanding public confidence and demonstrating independence. I would do anything required to be an ambassador
default,
default but I would do it on the principle that
default,
default if the legal ombudsman looks good, then I look good. But it does not work vice versa
default,
default and certainly I would want to ensure that the legal ombudsman is seen in the best possible public light.
defaultQ28 default&#xa0; 
defaultRt Hon Sir Alan Beith (Chairdefault)default:default 
defaultHave you anything else that you think ought to be drawn to our attention that is relevant to this appointment?
defaultStephen Greendefault: 
defaultI do not think so, Chair
default. 
defaultY
defaultou have drawn out of me everything that I came to say
default, though
default I am sure when I walk out of this room I will think of a thousand things
default that I would like to have said.
default I am grateful for the way that you have heard me and drawn these things out of me
default,
default and 
defaultI 
defaultam very happy with what has taken place. 
defaultRt Hon Sir Alan Beith (Chairdefault)default:default 
defaultThank you very much. We will very quickly reach conclusions and communicate them to the Minister, so we hope it will not be very long before you know whether you really are in this job or not.
default Thank you very much.
defaultStephen Greendefault: 
defaultThank you.
