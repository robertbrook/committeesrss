"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the Police and Crime Commissioner for North Wales [CST0050]&#xa0;What, if any, targets do you set for your police force?  What impact do you think this has on police recording crime practices?In my Police \nand Crime Plan I do not set any numerical targets for North Wales Police Force to achieve.\n------------------------------------------How do you assure yourself that the recorded crime figures for your area are correct?  To what extent can you trust the crime statistics for your area?North Wales Police employ a “Crime Registrar” whose role it is to monitor and audit recorded crime figures. The Registrar maintains an Audit Plan, which is used to ensure that North Wales Police follows a consistent and accura\nte process to record crime.  Information from the Audit Plan is shared directly with my Office.  \nIn November 2013, I raised the national issue of the integrity of police crime statistics at a Senior Executive Board meeting.  (The Senior Executive Board is\n the key forum where, amongst other things, I hold the Chief Constable to account).  I explained the importance of scrutinising crime recording processes and that as North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner I must be satisfied that these processes are fit\n for purpose. \nOn 4\nth\n December 2013 I received a briefing by the Chief Superintendent of Corporate Services to explain the processes North Wales Police use to ensure the robustness of their crime recording activity.\nNorth Wales Police have a Crime \nRecording User Group which is chaired and attended by senior officers within the Force.  The terms of reference for the group include the following:\nAims and Objectives &#xa0;\nIt is now agreed that my Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner attend that meeting for scrutiny purposes.\nI have long been aware that the principles North Wales Police apply to th\neir crime recording processes are not necessarily applied to the same extent in other police forces.  This has \nsometimes led to comparatively less favourable crime statistics for North Wales and is a matter that has been raised by North Wales Police and my\nself with HMIC.  \nFrom what we know at present there is nothing to indicate that we should not trust the crime statistics maintained by \nN\north \nW\nales Police.  However, as stated above we are in the process of increasing scrutiny with regard to this subject.\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
