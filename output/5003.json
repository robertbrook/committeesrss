"&#xa0;\nSubmission from Tony Travers, London School of Economics and Political Science (FDC 33)&#xa0;\nBackground&#xa0;Local government funding has become significantly more centrally-controlled in the period since the 1960s.  In the past 40 years, two major inquiries have examined local \nauthority\n finance.  From 1974 to 1976, the \nLayfield\n Committee undertook a major review of the subject.  Between 2003 and 2007, the Balance of Funding review (led by Nick \nRaynsford\n, MP) and the Lyons Inquiry considered the question, albeit in an environment where the possibility of radical change was much reduced.  Between these two periods of reflection, local government taxation was reformed twice, in 1989/90 and 1993.  The political impact of introducing and then abolishing the community charge (the ‘poll tax’) was so severe that national politicians, including the Scottish government, are now locked into a policy of capping and freezing local taxation.  Cities in England have been particularly affected by this change because of their relative dependence on central grants: when resources are increasing, inner urban authorities have tended to gain relative to other areas, but when reductions in grant are made, they are more exposed to cuts in funding.\n&#xa0;\nThese changes to local government funding have taken place in parallel to a radical restructuring of the British economy.  Between the early 1960s and 2014, many cities have seen their traditional industrial base shrink.  At the same time, new sectors have emerged, though with different needs in terms of skills and location.  All the conurbations within Britain continue to have a significant legacy of industrial dereliction and pockets of under- and unemployment.  \n&#xa0;\nCity governments have, since the troubled years of the 1980s, developed new policies and expertise in their efforts to regenerate their central and inner areas.  The evolution of city regional machinery has complemented the efforts of individual city councils to lead improvement.  In London, the Greater London Authority has been able to make longer-term plans and lobby for resources.  But in doing this, city governments have had to operate within a public finance system where central departments determine policy, allocate resources and make all major investment decisions.        \n&#xa0;\nThe UK and England in an international context&#xa0;\nThe UK has the most centrally-controlled system of public finance of any major OECD country.  The simplest way to judge this assertion is by considering the taxation determined by sub-national government (local government and any regional or state tier) in the larger OECD nations.  The taxation attributable to sub-national government as a share of GDP is 16.1 per cent in Sweden, 10.4 per cent in Germany, 8.8 per cent in Spain, 6.5 per cent in Italy, 4.6 per cent in France and 1.7 per cent in \nthe United Kingdom.\n   The UK figure consists entirely of council tax.  Even if the proportion of non-domestic rates retained by councils since April 2013 (in reality, a hybrid of a grant and local taxation) were added in, the figure would only rise to perhaps 2.5 per cent.  The UK is a substantial outlier by international standards.  Moreover, as council taxes in England and Scotland are capped and frozen, it would be appropriate to see the UK as a country where virtually 100 per cent of taxation is determined by central government. \n&#xa0;\nThe UK is also unusual in having only a single tax (council tax in Britain) available at the sub-national level.  Most cities in other developed countries have access to a number of different tax sources\n.  Until the introduction of the New Homes Bonus (NHB) in England, there was no fiscal incentive for authorities to increase the tax base because equalisation subsequently removed any growth in that base.  Even the current arrangements, where there is a short-term incentive, have been made less effective because (a) NHB resources are ‘top sliced’ from central funding and (b) in the capital the government has decided to use part of the yield to fund the London Enterprise Panel.   Non-domestic rate (NDR) retention, which started in 2013-14, allows councils to retain a proportion of any growth in the tax base, though within a highly complex infrastructure of central support and subject to an unpredictable, periodic, ‘re-setting’ of the overall funding system.  A number of major cities have negotiated City Deals with Whitehall which allow them to retain NDR growth in the longer-term, to fund infrastructure improvements.  \n&#xa0;\nIn short, cities in England have little fiscal autonomy, only modest and unpredictable incentives to build up their local tax-base. Moreover, they have to second-guess the centrally-determined funding environment for future years.   Most cities overseas have significantly greater autonomy, do not face regular reforms to the local funding system and can plan their income sources in the medium-term with reasonable certainty.   \n&#xa0;\nEngland’s place within the UK&#xa0;\nScotland and Wales, which have been granted substantial devolved power since 1999, are each in the process of being given increased autonomy over locally-raised taxes.  Stamp Duty, Landfill Tax and, potentially, income tax will in future be determined in Edinburgh and Cardiff.  Local government finance is already a devolved matter.  \n&#xa0;\nIn England, there has been no devolution.  Government is largely run by a number of Whitehall offices and by a series of nationally-appointed \nquangos\n with responsibilities for resource-allocation and/or service regulation. Local government, including city \ncouncils and city regional authorities, is responsible for a number of residual local and agency functions.  \n&#xa0;\nThe willingness of successive governments to devolve powers and resources to Scotland and Wales owes \nmuch\n to their history as nations.  But the decision to transfer to Edinburgh and Cardiff responsibility for most domestic legislation and, now, tax-raising powers carries with it the implication that the post-1999 devolved governments are capable of competent administration.  Thus it has proved.  Yet in England cities and city regions have fewer powers than either the devolved administrations or comparable places overseas.\n&#xa0;\nGreater Manchester has total ‘gross value added’ of £50bn, more than that of Wales (£47bn). The West Midlands (former metropolitan county area) also has a larger GVA than Wales. Birmingham alone has an economy two-thirds the size of Northern Ireland’s.  London’s GVA (£310bn) is 60 per cent bigger than that of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland added together.       \n&#xa0;\nDespite the existence of such large city and sub-regional economies and evidence in many cases of effective governance arrangements, successive governments have offered only modest and marginal freedoms to city and city regional governments.  As far as devolution is concerned, there is a policy vacuum in England.   \n&#xa0;\nThe economic performance of cities in England&#xa0;\nMany British cities have GVA per capita below the national average\n.  Despite the efforts of local and central government, there is still some way to go before city economies perform to their full potential.  In particular, a ring of former industrial areas outside the central and inner neighbourhoods of core cities still require redevelopment and improvement.  The establishment of city regional machinery, encouraged by successive governments, is now seen as a key element in progress towards the strengthening of these outer districts.  \n&#xa0;\nThe population of the United Kingdom is officially projected to increase from 62 million today to over 70 million by 2027.  There is a powerful consensus to minimise the use of green land to accommodate the eight million expected new inhabitants in the coming 13 years.  Cities can provide the space to house and employ them, but only if their local governments can access (at least some of) the growth in tax resources generated locally so as to re-invest in infrastructure and services.\n&#xa0;\nCity leaders are generally enthusiastic about expanding local population and employment.  But if city administrations are to be able successfully to allocate resources to local priorities, central government will need to let go of some of the tax \nresources currently in the hands of ministers.  Attempting to make decisions in Whitehall about all but the smallest local projects will never be efficient or effective.  \n&#xa0;\nThe successful redevelopment of urban economies would be assisted by allowing more decisions about investment and public services to be made within cities and city regions.  Increasing the incentive to build up the local tax base would encourage this objective.    \n&#xa0;\nLondon and the Core Cities&#xa0;\nThe London Finance Commission\n, appointed by the Mayor of London, proposed a number of modest reforms to the funding of sub-national government in the capital.  Building on the logic of the government’s own non-domestic rate reforms of 2013 and of the proposed Greater Manchester ‘Earn Back’ scheme\n, the Commission proposed that the full suite of property taxes (council tax, non-domestic rates, stamp duty land tax, capital gains tax on property and related revenues) should be transferred to London government\n.  Future decisions about operational details such as revaluation and tax rates would also be devolved. \n&#xa0;\nAt the point of reform, there would be a £-for-£ reduction in London’s central grant receipts so there was no net gain or loss.  Thereafter, the Greater London Authority and the boroughs would be incentivised to develop the city’s economy in such a way that increased their (wider) tax base.  Such a reform would increase the proportion of taxes retained locally from about 5 per cent in 2012-13 to 12 per cent.   \n&#xa0;\nThe Commission only considered London, but its report was explicit that a similar reform could easily and with advantage be undertaken in Greater Manchester, the Leeds city region or in other metropolitan areas.  The Core Cities endorsed the LFC report.  However, there would be difficulties in proposing that the whole country adopted such reforms in one go, as this would be likely to generate strong opposition within central government.  Using the exceptional position of some of the cities as justification for a limited reform within England would have a greater chance of success than an England-wide change.        \n&#xa0;\nPossible risks&#xa0;\nThe Treasury and other parts of government will argue there are a number of potential risks from allowing cities or city regions a degree of fiscal autonomy.  First, there might be a weakening of the Treasury’s control of the UK economy, public \nexpenditure and the deficit.  Second, there is a fear that extreme or irresponsible politicians will somehow take control of city halls.  Third, there is a fear within Whitehall departments of losing control over their \nown \nbudgets and service responsibilities.  Fourth, there is a perception that local civic leaders are somehow less competent than national ones.  Finally, the baleful experience of reforming the rates and community charge between 1989 and 1993 has made all national politicians fearful of making changes to local taxation.\n&#xa0;\nThere are good responses to all of these challenges.  Perhaps the most convincing is the ease with which the administrations in Scotland and Wales have assumed control of virtually all central government responsibilities without mishap.  Devolving power has worked.  In England, contemporary city leaderships are self-evidently moderate, pragmatic and effective. The single biggest obstacle to reform is the fear within the Treasury and service departments that they will lose control of spending levels and provision which can only be run effectively by them.  International experience suggests more balanced (that is, less centralised) constitutional arrangements are not a problem.  Devolved and decentralised models in virtually all other countries work effectively.  Chicago, Frankfurt and Lyon are no more ‘out of control’ than British cities, but they have greater freedom to innovate.      \n&#xa0;\nWhy change is required&#xa0;In recent decades, efforts to reform council or city funding have been met with listless fatalism within the core of government. It is recognised that something should be done, but no one feels the system is powerful enough to bring about change.  Central government, particularly within England, has become so centralised that, ironically, it finds it hard to address many issues. It is too strong, yet too weak.  The prime minister and senior Cabinet members now have hour-by-hour responsibility for detailed provision across England and face a continuous barrage of crises in hospitals, schools, the welfare system, public service regulation and \nquangos\n.  Devolving financial powers to city government would make the Cabinet’s job easier and would place responsibilities more sensibly.  Reform is necessary to protect and enhance the British constitution.  \n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n \nRaising the Capital\n, the report of the London Finance Commission (citing OECD \nRevenue Statistics\n), Table 1, London Finance Commission, 2013\n \nRaising the Capital\n, the report of the London Finance Commission (citing OECD \nRevenue Statistics\n), Working Paper \non \nInternational Comparison of Global City Financing\n, prepared by Enid Slack, \nUniversity\n of \nToronto\n, 2013\n \nSee \nNo Cities, No Civilisation; no successful cities, no successful nations\n, \nTable 2, \nMichael Parkinson, \n Liverpool John \nMoores\n University, \nCore Cities 2013\n \nThe author was chair of the London Finance Commission\n, though this evidence is written in a personal capacity\n \nSee \nGreater Manchester City Deal\n, Greater Manchester Combined Authority, \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/221014/Greater-Manchester-City-Deal-final_0.pdf\n, page 8\n \nRaising the Capital\n, the report of the London \nFinance Commission,\n 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
