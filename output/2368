[normal]I understand that the following organisations  have made submissions in relation to the above proposed  Bill: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Green Lanes Environmental Action Movement
[normal]The Green Lanes Protection Group
[normal]The Peak District Green Lanes Alliance
[normal]The Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I strongly support the submissions made by all the above.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I myself am a keen walker but in the last 10 years I have seen the degradation of our beautiful landscapes by recreational off-road vehicles. Indeed some of the green lanes in the Yorkshire Dales National Park were so thoroughly trashed that they were almost unusable by any other group of people. Leaving aside the damage caused to these ancient tracks there is the question of the pollution and noise caused by vehicles raging across these glorious landscapes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I used to visit the Peak District National Park quite regularly to enjoy the wonders it provided in terms of beauty, peace and tranquillity.  Over the last few years it has become almost impossible to enjoy such things in the Peak District as there is very little chance you will escape the thundering hoard of motor bikes or 4x4s on the fells.   So I simply stopped going to the Peak District.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If the Government is to have any credibility in its care for the environment, its commitment to people getting exercise and fighting obesity then it has to take firm action so that those who want to enjoy our countryside and its wildlife can do so safely and in the knowledge that they will achieve the peace and tranquillity they crave.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]One only has to venture  on to the continent to see how jealously our European cousins guard their National Parks and it makes me ashamed when friends from abroad look askance those activities are allowed in OUR National Parks.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If there is no stomach to instigate  the proposals on a countrywide basis then, at the very least, they should be instigated by introducing such proposals in our National Parks.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We need green spaces if we are not to be completely suffocated  by urban sprawl and those green spaces and magnificent landscapes should be preserved for all the generations to come.
