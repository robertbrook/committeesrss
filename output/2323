[normal]Written evidence submitted by Ben Hardwick [OLS0022][bold]&#xa0;
[normal]I 
[normal]am
[normal] delighted to hear of your committee’s laudable efforts to look into the subject of 
[normal]the
[normal] damage 
[normal]that 
[normal]can be done to the younger generation by uncontrolled internet access – thank you very much for 
[normal]launching 
[normal]this
[normal] enquiry
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]T
[normal]he ordered, peaceful and generally prosperous 
[normal]outward-looking UK society with its 
[normal]opportunities, comprehensively organised education, 
[normal]healthcare, aid, inf
[normal]rastructure and
[normal] defence/security arrangements
[normal] 
[normal]are a priceless result of the daily work of Government – something that is rarely recognised or valued like it should be.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]These benefits also extend far beyond Britain’s shores and the UK i
[normal]s still a beacon of tolerance and crucial lynchpin of global peace and security
[normal] as well as 
[normal]being 
[normal]an example that is frequently followed by other Governments and States
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Little wonder then that Government is undoubtedly an instrument of God – 
[normal]1
[normal]st
[normal] Epistle 
[normal]of 
[normal]Peter
[normal], Chapter
[normal] 2, V13
[normal];
[normal] it is a ‘giver’ and ‘provider’ as well as a ‘controller’
[normal] – again
[normal],
[normal] the Bible states 
[normal]in the Epistle to the Romans Chapter 13 
[normal]‘for 
[normal]he
[normal] bears not the sword in vain’
[normal] along with a good deal else
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Government’s first duty 
[normal]is
[normal] the protection of its citizens
[normal] – this is an area at which HMG excels whether in defence and intelligence matters or law-enforcement that stabilises and enhances the condition and experience of society and its citizens and the whole global community.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I se
[normal]ek by these few paragraphs to set out simply how absolutely right it is for you to persist with better control measures 
[normal]on internet viewing 
[normal]and that you may be encouraged 
[normal]and set forward 
[normal]in doing what is clearly your duty.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am a farther of 4 children fro
[normal]m 3 
[normal]to 
[normal]10 years old and revel in watching their rapid development and willingness to absorb knowledge at an apparently impossible rate. They are very impressionable and it is a very great responsibility as parents that my wife and I have in protecting and 
[normal]nurturing the next generation
[normal] into responsible citizens
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Affectionate
[normal] control and unselfishness is absolutely critical in this and it is really tragic to hear figures from OFCOM that more than 75% of 14-16 year olds have accessed adult material.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This i
[normal]s a situation that will cause permanent mind-scarring and a lack of fidelity and stable relationships on which true happiness is built in 
[normal]our 
[normal]society
[normal] – to say nothing of the cost to 
[normal]Government and the taxpayer of broken homes because of so-called freedom t
[normal]o look at this 
[normal]content
[normal] when in one’s tender teens.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]HMG should move forward fearlessly with comprehensive and efficient control measures of what is currently a lawless ‘wild west’ of media so as not to fail the potential of following generations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is 
[normal]a
[normal] most revolting and immoral 
[normal]thought
[normal] that there are actually publishers and persons making millions out of degrading us and ruining the moral compass of the young in our society.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I believe that there should be default blocking of all adult material on inte
[normal]rnet enabled devices sold in the UK as soon as possible.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I wish you all the best and courage in your deliberations on this vital subject.
