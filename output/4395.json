"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Ethos Capital Ltd [OLS0092]&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSubject:              T\nhe Post Office\n \ncould be \nat the Forefront of Internet Safety\n&#xa0;\nSummary&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDetails&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n(\n1\n)\n How best to protect minors from accessing adult content;\n&#xa0;\n(\n2\n)\n Filtering out extremist material, including images of child abuse and material intended to promote terrorism or other acts of violence;\n&#xa0;\n(\n3\n)\n \nPreventing \nabusive or threatening comments on social media.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIn addition, this \nService \nwould \nmake it more di\nfficult for\n sex \noffenders \nto \npose as teenagers on social networks to deceive their targets.\nFurthermore, this \nService \nwould facilitate \nthe realisation of the \nParliament 2.0 vision that was announced \nrecently \nby the Speaker, Mr John \nBercow\n, and which involved \nE\n-\nV\noting.\n  \n T\nhis is because E-Voting requires establishing \nproper links between \n‘\nonline identities\n’\n and ‘real\n-\nworld identities\n’.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n(1) \nMinors can easily access adult content\n&#xa0;\n(2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nS\nex \noffenders\n pose as teenagers on social netw\norks to deceive their \ntargets\n&#xa0;\n(3)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAbusive and threatening comments \nby anonymous users on \nsocial media\n&#xa0;5.               Solution&#xa0;\nThe simplest and most robust solution to \nthe above \nproblems is to find a way to reliably and systematically \nverify the age of Users when visiting certain websites and, at the same \ntime, to protect their privacy.\n&#xa0;\nThis can be easily done using a unique code that is issued based on \na face\n-to-face and ID verification and then used regularly by Users when visiting c\nertain websites.\n&#xa0;\nWe are suggesting utilising the \nPost Office’s \nvast network of \nbranches \nacross the UK to verify the age of Users so Users can generate these unique codes automatically.\n&#xa0;\n6.               Implementation&#xa0;\nWe have \ndeveloped \na website that enables each \nauthorised Post Office employee to verify the age of any User who presents a valid ID in person.  This verification enables the User to generate a unique Code online.\n&#xa0;\nIf the User would like to visit a third-party website that requires age verification, th\ney can enter this generated Code on that website. This Code will then be authenticated by our servers without revealing the name or details of the User as \nwe don’t hold this information.\n&#xa0;\nTherefore, third-party websites will be able to grant access to real\n Users with the appropriate age, at the same time that the privacy of these Users will be protected.  Furthermore, for additional safety, Users (or their parents) will receive an email or an SMS notification each time the Code is used.\n&#xa0;\nThe Post Office can\n charge a fee for verifying the accounts of Users in a similar manner to how it processes passport applications.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n2\n&#xa0;\n"
