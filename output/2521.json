"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Camden Council&#xa0;\n1.1.\n \nThe London Borough of Camden \nincludes\n \nsome of the wealthiest and \nthe \nmost deprived neighbourhoods in London. Housing costs are extremely high and it has one of London’s largest social housing stocks with \na third\n of the population living in social rented accommodation. \nA\nnother third of households\n live in the private rented s\nector\n, the sixth highest proportion in England and Wales. \n&#xa0;\n1.2.\n \n28,000 or 30% of all households in the borough claim \nH\nousing \nB\nenefit. The Council estimates that \naround 5,400\n of these have been affected by \none or more of the three \nmajor \nH\nousing \nB\nenefit \nchanges\n.\n \nAccording to analysis by Sheffield Hallam University, Camden is by no means the most affected borough in London (ranking 15\nth\n of 33 and 112\nth\n of 384 nationally for overall loss of benefit per working age adult). However \nhigh housing costs and high demand \nfor social housing make the impacts more severe in Camden. \nThe \nLabour-controlled council\n has made preserving the social mix a priority for the Council. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;2.1.\n \nAn important indicator \nof success or failure\n for a local authority\n in dealing with the \nH\nousing \nB\nenefit changes is the \nnumber of\n \nhouseholds who are \nstatutory \nhomeless or in \ntemporary accommodation (TA)\n. \nB\noth have remained at low \nlevels\n so far\n contrary to London and national trends\n. \nJ\nust \n11\n households a month\n on average\n \nhave been \naccepted as statutorily homeless (Part VII) since May 2012 and \nTA\n numbers are still on a long term downward trajectory. \n&#xa0;\n2.2.\n \nCamden has \nbeen helped in its re\nsponse to welfare \nchanges\n by its \nlong term investment in homelessness prevention services, a response to the \nlong standing\n housing issues in the borough. \nThe \nCouncil has\n an excellent track record in \nplacing\n households at risk of homele\nssness in sustainable\n tenancies\n. \nThe\n service has supported\n nearly 500 households\n affected by the LHA cap\n; 30% of them were helped to stay in their homes and 32% were helped to make a successful \nbid for a council property\n \nin the borough \nor move to other private rented sector ac\ncommodation. Only 11 \nof these \nhouseholds ended up making a Part VII homelessness application.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.3.\n \nThe Council\n has also been proactive in supporting households affected by the \nSocial Sector Size Criteria\n (SSSC)\n primarily by \nencourag\ning\n moves to right-size acc\nommodation and to provide advice and support, including \nDHPs\n where \nneeded\n. \nSince January 2013, housing officers have advised over 1,000 council tenants. \nSupport for under-occupying households includes a scheme called “First Choice Plus” through which council voids are decorated to a higher standard than usual and reserved for under-occupiers, cash incentives, handholding and proactive help with moving, and\n advice and assistance to help under-occupiers maximise their chances of achieving a move through various social tenant mobility schemes, including HousingMoves.\n&#xa0;\n2.4.\n \nAnother success factor for the borough has been \nclose collaboration between council departments and with local partners. The best solution for families who may be affected by total benefit cap \n(TBC) \nis finding work over \n16 hours thus exempting them from the cap. This \nrequires close work with the family, Job Centre Plus and other local agencies. Ho\nusing officers are referring people to Job Centre Plus, advice agencies or children’s centres for employment support. \nAs of \nSeptember\n 2013, \nJob Centre Plus had supported 15\n0 people who would have been affected by the cap into employment.\n When the Council r\necently let new advice contracts, it completely changed the relationship \nwith\n local advice agencies by setting up the Camden Advice Partnership to foster a more equal and collaborative relationship. \n&#xa0;\n2.5.\n \nHowever finding work is not viable for all affected hou\nseholds. Many face multiple barriers to employment. In these cases, t\nhe Council has \nbeen making\n \nflexible \nuse of Discretionary Housing Payments (DHPs) – in one case, the family moved out of London but a DHP was used to pay for the daughter’s rail season tic\nket to allow her to remain at school in Camden and sit her exams. \nThe purpose of DHPs is to buy households time to find a long-term s\nolution to their housing needs\n. To do this effectively, the Benefits service (which authorise the payment) and housing offi\ncers (who provide advice and support) \nmust work\n closely together. \nIn this respect, Camden has benefitted from retaining its housing stock in-house – working relationships with housing associations have been less close and anecdotal evidence from elsewhere \nsuggests that boroughs with ALMOs have struggled to respond effectively to the challenges of welfare reform. \n&#xa0;\n2.6.\n \n \nCamden Council believes that its response to \nwelfare \nchanges have \nonce again \ndemonstrated \nthe effectiveness of local gov\nernment and its local \npartner\ns\n \nagainst a back drop of major pressures on budgets. While the government have of course provided additional funding to support councils, this is in a wider context of large scale cuts to their budgets. \nL\nocal knowledge, partnerships and relations\nhip\ns with residents of local authorities\n have been a major factor in this effectiveness\n. \nThis is why \nCamden along with other local authorities \nhas deep concerns about the end of its role in the administration of \nH\nousing \nB\nenefit and the ability of the DWP to d\neliver Universal Credit effectively. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;3.1.\n \nAs noted above, o\nne of the major impacts of the changes for local authorities is \non homelessness and TA. If\n,\n as a result of \nH\nousing \nB\nenefit changes, a household \nbecomes homeless, the council’s statutory duties have resource implications especially if they are placed in \nTA\n. \nThe introduction of the \nTBC\n will make it harder to procure \nTA\n at \nan affordable rate\n and in some cases, the council \nhas leased properties for several years that will no longer be fu\nlly covered by Housing Benefit for which t\nhe Council will need to make up the shortfall. The Council has been working with \nTA\n households at risk of the cap to place them in more \naffordable\n ac\ncommodation\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.2.\n \n As well as the impact on households currently in \nTA\n, there is a significant risk that \nH\nousing \nB\nenefit changes will increase demand for \nTA\n over the medium term. \nT\nhis did \nnot happen with the LHA changes, \nlargely due to \nthe new Localism Act pow\ner\n, \nthe inherent great\ner\n mobility of\n private rented sector tenants and not least the council’s interventions. These interventions cost \nthe council money both through additional placements in the private rented sector and the fact that some LHA households m\noved to the social rented sector thus taking that housing away from other needs groups. However \nthere are reasons to think that the SSSC and TBC will result in increased homelessness and demand for \nTA\n. \nAlready a majority of our tenants affected by the SSSC\n are in arrears and some will eventually become at risk of eviction. This will result in additional costs to the council regardless of whether they become homeless or are prevented from becoming homeless by council intervention\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.3.\n \nThe new power to discharge\n their homelessness responsibilities by placing households in the private rented sector has helped local authorities in this area. In addition, the DWP have greatly increased funding for Discretionary Housing Payments – Camden received £1.6m in 2012/13. We\n are using DHPs to prevent homelessness in the short term. For example, we are giving DHPs to all households affected by the TBC to \ngive\n them \ntime to \nadjust to their reduced benefit. \nHowever\n \nw\ne do not know from year to year what our DHP allocation will be and our concern is that the full effects of housing benefit changes will be felt in future years when there may not be sufficient DHP funding to cope.  \nWe are anticipating that DHP claims will\n increase significantly from now on as the combined effects of welfare changes, especially the Benefit Cap, impact on claimants alongside increasing cost of living pre\nssures from fuel and food bills\n. We are doing all we can to alert households to the conse\nquences of burying their heads in the sand but we cannot oblige them to take action. In addition, DHPs can only be used to top up \nH\nousing \nB\nenefit payments, they do not cover the costs of these interventions which the council has had to fund itself (see bel\now). \n&#xa0;\n3.4.\n \nAlthough we cannot quantify it at this stage, \nhomelessness, \nTA\n and prevention activities are\n a clear example\n of how \nreducing the welfare spend could result in increased costs for \nlocal authorities. This ‘cost shunting’\n \nis creating\n pressures on local\n authority budgets not least because funding from central government continues to be reduced. It will result in further difficult \nbudget \ndecisions for councils and \nthus \nto ‘blame shunting’ from government to local authorities\n&#xa0;\n3.5.\n \nA further concern and pressur\ne on DHPs and Council funds is the DWP’s decision not to exempt Local \nAuthority-\nowned \nsupported accommodation from the Benefit Cap in Metropolitan and Unitary authorities. The support given to these vulnerable claimants through support\ned\n accommodation is v\nital and we cannot understand \nthe DWP’s rationale for\n exempt\ning\n such people in District Authorit\nies\n but not in a London Borough such as Camden.  \n&#xa0;\n3.6.\n \nWelfare \nchanges have \nresulted in additional \nshort-term \ndemands on council services for example visiting affec\nted households and working with RSLs to identify households affected by the SSSC\n. \nIn 2013/14 the Council expects that over £800,000 of existing resource will be diverted to work related to responding to the welfare changes, including staff in housing and b\nenefit teams offering \nsupport and advice to residents\n.\n &#xa0;\n3.7.\n \nIn the longer term, the introduction of UC will mean councils will no longer be responsible for administering \nH\nousing \nB\nenefit. In theory this should be cost-neutral to the council. However in the interim period this makes it difficult for the \nC\nouncil to retain or recruit benefits officers. This \nissue is compounded by the uncertainty regarding the timetable for rolling out \nUC – it is difficult for the council to allocate resources in this context. \n&#xa0;\n3.8.\n \nBreaking the link between councils and \nH\nousing \nB\nenefit has other unintended consequences. \nHousing \nB\nenefit is a gateway benefit for other benefits such \nas free school meals and Bl\nue Badges\n which will continue to be administered by local authorities\n. This \nwill\n \nrequire real-time\n accurate \ninformation \nflows from the DWP to the local authority. We are concerned that the DWP \nhas \nnot given sufficient consideration to these future data nee\nds for local authorities. \n&#xa0;\n3.9.\n \nThere are impacts on other council services resulting from households moving because of welfare changes. We know that over 1,000 children resident in Camden and attending Camden schools are affected by housing benefit changes (n\note that many children attending Camden schools live outside the borough and vice versa)\n. If these children have to move schools, this not only potentially disrupts their schooling but also creates transactional costs for the school and the local authority\n. We are planning to produce an estimate of how many children have moved schools as a result of the LHA changes. \n&#xa0;\n3.10.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn theory, the \nSSSC \ncould provide an additional impetus for \ncouncil’s\n tenants to downsize, thus making better use of the council’s limited housing stock, reducing overcrowding etc. This is a particular issue in Camden as we have a large stock of 1 bed properties \nand fewer larger properties. \n28% of affected tenants have regi\nstered to downsize and \n46 households affected by the SSSC have moved since 1 April\n. However \nevidence suggests \nmany affected tenants are not prepared to move and those that are are not bidding on available smaller properties\n. This could be because these sma\nller properties are unsuitable or not attractive.  \nThere are additional transactional costs associated with an increase in moves within the council’s housing stock, most notably in properties which have received adaptations for disabled residents. In these\n cases, we are currently meeting shortfalls with DHPs but this is not sustainable in the long term. \n&#xa0;\n3.11.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nN\nearly three quarters of SSSC-affected households said they will manage the shortfall in their \nH\nousing \nB\nenefit\n \nwhen contacted by council officers\n. \nThe cou\nncil is concerned that some of these households, along with those who have registered to downsize but have not \nmoved\n, are storing up trouble for the future rather than genuinely managing \ntheir finances\n. This concern is borne out by arrears data - the percentage of \nSSSC-affected households\n in arrears has increased from 42% in April to 54% in August and is far higher than the rate for all tenants (40%). While this rate includes all households in arrears, \nno matter how small the amount\n or when the debt was accrued\n, the average amount owed by SSSC-affected households is \n£557.42\n, far higher than for all tenants. \nThe council faces a difficult choice if and when arrears \nreach\n a critical point for these househol\nds – eviction (which may result in further costs to the council in homelessness and TA) or somehow handling the arrears (e.g. by writing them off). We are not yet at this point, but again we are concerned that \nthe government is robbing Peter to pay Paul – \nsaving money from the benefits budget at the expense of local authorities. \n&#xa0;\n3.12.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf this is true of \nthe \nSSSC, it is all the more so of \nUniversal Credit. \nOver the years, a shortage of social rented properties in Camden and across London has had the effect of a \ngeneral increase in the vulnerability of council tenants (for example, lone parents make up 10% of all households \nin the borough compared with 23% \nin council rented properties). Council tenants on \nH\nousing \nB\nenefit are unused to budgeting for their housing c\nosts which is likely to result in increased arrears. We are also concerned that \nthe \ndigital by default \npolicy \nis misguided given the vulnerability of many \nH\nousing \nB\nenefit claimants and this has been borne out by the findings of the UC pilots concerning dig\nital exclusion.\n&#xa0;\n3.13.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe replacement of Council Tax Benefit \n(CTB) \nwith a localised \nCouncil Tax Reduction (CTR) \nScheme posed a dilemma for the Council. \nIf we had adopted a scheme that offered the same level of support by \nabsorb\ning\n the 10% reduction in funding f\nrom central government, we would have created a permanent funding pressure \nof around £2.5m a year. \nWe accepted the \none year transition\nal \n grant \nwhich allowed us to limit the minimum amount people had to pay to \n8.5% of their council tax liability (between £\n1 and £4 a week).\n \n&#xa0;\n3.14.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe are \nconsulting on\n \nthe scheme for 2014/15 \n– our preferred option is\n to retain\n this year’s scheme but with\n \nan amendment to \nincrease the earnings disregard by £10 a week to improve incentives to work. \nThis will add to the\n ongoing \nfunding pressure but we feel it is the right thing to do. \n&#xa0;\n3.15.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe feel the CTR is a particularly blatant example of ‘blame shunting’ to local government. We understand that all parts of government need to make savings and local government does have a strong t\nrack record in this area. We have been faced with a difficult choice between increased costs and creating additional financial burdens for low income households which may end up being self-defeating if they are not able to pay. We have chosen a middle way \nbut this has still resulted in a budget pressure for the council. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;4.1.\n \nThe changes to the \nLHA \nare\n the only \nH\nousing\n \nB\nenefit \nchange \nfor which we have information about longer ter\nm impacts. However the council has limited information because we only know who claims and has stopped claiming in the borough.\n&#xa0;\n4.2.\n \nThere is no doubt that there have been changes since the LHA changes were introduced in April 2011. Of the 1,800 households whi\nch were capped in April 2011, only 44% were still claiming LHA in Camden in June 2013. 15% had secured a council or RSL tenancy in Camden and 40% had stopped claiming LHA in Camden – they may have moved, found employment etc. \n&#xa0;\n4.3.\n \nT\nhe overall stock of LHA cl\naimants has decreased by just 2%\n so while s\nome \nhave left the borough, \nthere are more taking their place\n. However the geographical distribution of LHA claimants in Camden has changed\n with increases in cheaper areas and decreases in Central London\n. The profi\nle of LHA claimants appears to have changed as well - the trend seems to be towards smaller households with fewer children. \n&#xa0;\n4.4.\n \nThis evidence \nappears to support\n the commonly held thesis that the impact of welfare \nchanges \nin London is \nfor \npeople\n to move\n out o\nf Central and Inner London to Outer London and beyond. However we cannot say \nfor sure \nhow much of this change in down to the LHA changes and how \nmuch would have happened anyway\n,\n especially given\n LHA claimants are generally more mobile than other HB claiman\nts. \n&#xa0;\n4.5.\n \nThere are also a large number of households (44% of the original capped cohort) who are still in the borough. Anecdotal evidence from the \nhouseholds supported by the \ncouncil’s housing department is that \nthey\n would rather struggle with rent and/or become overcrowded than leave the\nir\n community \nand the \nnetworks \nthey have built up. The impacts of these coping mechanisms will only be felt over the longer term. \n&#xa0;\n4.6.\n \nWe are finding it increasingly difficult to place vulnerable households at risk of homelessness in the private rented sector in the borough. Before April 2011, 62% of placements in the private rented sector were in the borough - this has fallen to 35% sinc\ne April 2011. Moving outside the borough \ncan cause\n disruption to children’s schooling, social networks etc and risks increasing a household’s vulnerability.\n&#xa0;\n4.7.\n \nWe are concerned about the long term impact of the LHA changes on the social mix of the borough. M\narket rents in the private rented sector are steadily increasing while LHA rates in Camden are capped or kept at a very low rate of increase. If this continues for several years, even the relatively affordable area around Kilburn High Road will become unaf\nfordable for LHA claimants. \nAlthough o\nne of the stated aims of the LHA changes is “h\nousing \nb\nenefit should not support people who are not working to live in accommodation that would be out of the reach of most people in work\n”,\n \naround half of current claiman\nts in Camden are in work\n. Any further divergence between LHA rates and market rents will mean that workers on low incomes will find it increasingly difficult to rent in the private sector in Camden, especially as Camden’s social housing stock is under such\n pressure.\n&#xa0;\n4.8.\n \nThe effects of the \nSSSC have \nlargely \nyet to be felt. \nHowever as noted above, we are concerned about arrears for this group\n - over half of affected households are in arrears. \n&#xa0;\n4.9.\n \nBy definition this group has few \ndependent \nchildren. However we are \nconcerned that \ndisabled people\n \nmay\n have to leave an adapted home.\n In particular, households with disabled adult children do not get an additional room \nunder SSSC \nand we know of families in\n this position\n in Camden\n. \n&#xa0;\n4.10.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe do not yet have full data about the g\nroup of people who will be affected by the \nTBC. However based on \nMay 2013 DWP data\n, \n80% of households\n that are at risk of the cap \nhave children. The total number of children is 1\n,\n647 (about 4% of all children in Camden). 63% are in households with 4 or mor\ne children.\n The scale of the shortfalls involved (on average £70 per week\n per affected households, much higher in many cases\n) mean that households are unlikely to be able to absorb them and will need to move or find work. \nAlthough some claimants\n at risk of\n being affected\n have found work (see above)\n,\n \nthe profile of many of the households involved \n – number of children, language issues (many affected families are \nfrom \nBME\n backgrounds\n) \nand poor health – means that finding work will be difficult. Some households in the private rented sector may be able to move to the social rented sector although this is \nnot\n guaranteed to bring \nthem under the cap (40% of households are already in the soci\nal rented sector). For many households, leaving the borough and probably London entirely may be the only viable option.\n&#xa0;\n4.11.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Council believes that the LHA \nchanges\n and the TBC do not reflect the very high housing costs in Inner and Central London and\n \nit see\nms unreasonable to apply the same caps to London as to the rest of the country. The TBC is based on the national average household income of £26,000 whereas average household income in Camden is \nmore like £33,000\n. The effect is to make most of the borough \nunaffordable to \nhousing benefit claimants (at least in the private rented sector), reducing the social mix of the borough and in some cases, requiring \nhouseholds\n to leave their community.\n&#xa0;\n4.12.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe impacts of the new \nCouncil Tax Reduction scheme on resident\ns\n ar\ne discussed above. We have tried to set CTR at a level which is not too burdensome on either individual CTR claimants or council budgets. For \nmany\n, this will \ncome on top of the \nchanges \nto \nH\nousing \nB\nenefit and \nthus \nmay have a cumulative impact. However CTR i\ns a relatively small proportion of it and we are confident that the support available for housing benefit claimants described elsewhere \nabove\n \nwill help these households to cope. \n&#xa0;\n27 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
