"&#xa0;\nAFS0008&#xa0;\nWritten evidence s\nubmitted by Dr. Andrew Wilkins\nResearch Fellow in the School of Education at the University of \nRoehampton\n.\nThis submission draws upon interim findings from a three-year (2012-2015) Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)-funded project investigating the \nrole\n and practice of school governance and accountability in England today (Grant ref. ES/K001299/1).\nExecutive summary Accountability is the condition of securing public trust and public agreement on the equitable and fair distribution of public resources. On these terms account\nability refers to the duty\n and responsibility of all state-funded institutions to manage themselves efficiently and equitably through public consultation and transparency, and in accordance with the law. \nIn the specific case of converter and sponsor academies – schools with the flexibility and freedom to be administratively self-governing – and many other types of state-funded independent schools\n (e.g. free schools)\n, \nensuring \naccountability is \nnot the strategic responsibility of\n local government (though some risk assessment of academies is still performed by local government). Instead accountability is dispersed and devolved to boards of trustees (in the case of Multi-Academy and Umbrella Trust setups) and individual school governing bodies\n – what we might call the new ‘middle-tier’ in state education. \nThe Department for Education (\nDfE\n) at this time emphasizes the role and responsibility of school governors in facilitating ‘effective governance’, through providing scrutiny of direction, enabling strategy and hol\nding head teachers and senior leaders to account. \nBut despite calls from the government, Ofsted and some school governor support services (e.g. The National Governors Association, NGA) to professionalize governing bodies en masse through increased training, support, self-evaluation, external inspection and exhaustive data provision, the task of how accountability can be best achieved in practice, within \nand outside \nthe dynamics of governing bodies, lacks specificity and direction.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n‘consumer accountability’, e.g. strengthen consumer responsiveness and market position, foster school competition and market branding/impact.\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n‘\nperformative\n accountability’, e.g. performance management, responsiveness to arms-length regulatory bodies, targets, indicators and evaluations.\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n‘corporate accountability’, e.g. strengthen service efficiency, value for money, competitive tendering, emphasis on school survival, adaptability and flexibility.\n&#xa0;\nRecommendationsNovember 2013\n1\n&#xa0;\n"
