[[[ Action UK NI]]]&#xa0;a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The devolved government of NI must go about requesting power to control banking in Northern Ireland from Westminster asap.b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Failing this consider setting up its own government bank in order to help NI businesses perhaps via Department of Enterprise and Trade in order to make proper use of money offered at low interest from Bank of England.  This has currently been offered twice by the current coalition government to UK banks for them to pass onto GB and NI businesses, twice this has appeared to have failed.  Currently the banks can produce list of applications for business loans that they are supposedly dealing with. But the number of loans actually secured is far short of an acceptable level due to bank criteria to lend being purposely impossible to meet, meanwhile, the question remains are the bank using this ploy to secure money from government for their own benefit which they may not have to return?August 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
