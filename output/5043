[normal] For example, a report from the Revolving Doors Agency (Revolving Doors Agency (2013) 
[normal]First Generation: One Year On
[normal] – available at 
[normal]http://www.revolving-doors.org.uk/documents/first-generation-one-year-on/
[normal]) welcomes efforts by some PCCs to seek “lasting systemic change through partnership” with a view to reducing crime and improving wellbeing in their areas.
[normal] For example, a recent opinion poll found that 64% of people think that PCCs have made no difference to the police’s effectiveness at combating crime (3% thought PCCs had made the police more effective, 9% less effective and 25% did not know). Poll results available at

[normal] At present, at least one PCP (in West Yorkshire) receives additional funding from local sources while others rely solely on the funding provided by the Home Office.
[normal] See, for example, 
[normal]http://www.westmidlands-pcc.gov.uk/consultation/budget-and-precept-2014-15

[normal] Their annual report on police funding stated that: 
[normal]“HMIC is deeply disappointed with progress on collaboration … the pace of change on collaboration is too slow”

[normal] For example, five forces in the South West of England have agreed to pursue a new regional forensic services collaboration (
[normal]http://www.avonandsomerset-pcc.gov.uk/News-and-Events/News-Archive/2013/November/South-West-Forces-agree-Regional-Forensic-Collaboration.aspx
[normal]), while collaboration between Sussex and Surrey police forces was extended from 1
[normal]st
[normal] October 2013.
[normal] This was recently recognised in a collaboration agreement between Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire – for details see

[normal] For example, Chris Salmon, PCC for Dyfed-Powys, recently reported his office ‘receives in a day what the former police authority used to receive in a month’ (Salmon, C. (2013) ‘Opening the castle gates: how PCCs can deliver the public’s priorities’ in Chambers, M. (
