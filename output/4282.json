"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Carbon Tracker (IPC0038)The \nUN \nI\nntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s 5\nth\n Assessment Report supported the use of global carbon budgets\n,\n amid\nst\n a level of\n consensus \nfrom the global scientific community that is stronger \nthan ever \nthat \nglobal warming is exacerbated by man-made emissi\nons.\n&#xa0;About Carbon TrackerCarbon Tracker is a non-profit organisation working to align the capital markets with the climate change policy agenda. We are applying our thinking on carbon budgets and stranded assets across geographies and asset classes to in\nform investor thinking and the regulation of capital markets. We are funded by a number of US \nand UK charitable foundations. \nIntroductionCarbon Tracker welcomes the Energy and Climate Change Committee’s call for a discussion around the UN Intergovernment\nal Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) latest report as it provides an opportunity to ensure the weight of it\ns findings are not understated. \nCarbon Tracker’s research hypothesises a systemic risk sitting on the world’s capital markets due to the mismatch bet\nween climate change policy and the business models of listed coal, oil and gas companies. This has been illustrated by adopting a carbon budget approach – a comparison between the amount of carbon dioxide (CO\n2\n) emissions we can emit to have a good chance t\no limit global warming to the internationally agreed level of 2°C – the carbon budget – and the embedded CO\n2\n sitting in the coal, oil and gas reserves owned by fossil fuel companies. \nWe conclude that between 60 and 80% of reserves must stay in the ground a\nnd are ‘unburnable’.\n This has been supported by the IEA’s analysis that at least two thirds of the world’s fossil fuel reserves cannot be burnt unmitigated to have a 50% chance of achieving the 2°C target.\nThe IPCC’s latest research marks a significant \nevent for this way of thinking about future climate change because of the inclusion of a carbon budget anal\nysis. Their findings are consistent with those \nof Carbon Tracker’s research. The support of the scientific community behind the ‘unburnable carbon’ t\nhesis and the risks associated \nwith the incorrect valuation of fossil fuel reserves that\n ca\nn\n not be burnt, provides a significant reminder of the actions that need to be taken to transition to a low-carbon economy in a financially stable manner.\n For invest\nors and governments this also raises questions around where funds are spent going forward.\nDo the AR5 Physical Science Basis report’s conclusions strengthen or weaken the economic case for action to prevent dangerous climate change? Looking at the \neconomics of acting on climate change was not the remit of the Physical Science Basis report, but more t\nhe report being produced by the IPCC Working Group III \nset for release in April 2014 \nwhich \nwill look specifically at \nthe costs and benefits of different\n climate change mitigation \noptions. \nHowever, \nthe Physical Science Basis report reveals t\nhe \ndisparity between our current pathway and that of a safe level of climate change. This gives an indication of the level of ‘effort’ required to close the gap, from w\nhich you can get a sense of economic cost. \nWe see the conclusions of the IPCC’s Working Group I (WGI) AR5 report to strengthen the case for action to prevent dangerous climate change, i\nn spite of its prediction for a lower level of climate sensitivity tha\nn their AR4 report.\nIn the AR5 report the IPCC lowered its estimate of transient climate response to carbon emissions (TCRE) – climate sensitivity – from their 2007 report by 25%. While this translates into a reduction in the rate of warming, emissions are\n currently rising approximately 1.9% each year, meaning any resulting benefit that a lower sensitivity is more than balanced out by rising emissions. The authors indicate this by stating that ‘if the same level of effort required in 2010 to limit carbon di\noxide-induced warming to two degrees were applied starting in 2015, the resultant peak warming would be 10% higher, at 2.2°C’.\n In other words, the longer we delay emissions cuts, the faster those cuts will have to be to stay within the 2\n°\nC budget. In \nturn, the faster the cuts have to be, the harder and more costly they are, echoing the sentiments introduced by the Stern Review in 2006.\n \nThe issue of uncertainty around climate sensitivity has meant some have called for hesitancy before we commit economi\nc resources to act. However, as Martin Wolf, chief economics commentator at the Financial Times, wrote at the end of November, we should do exactly the opposite. \n‘[Climate] sceptics argue as if uncertainty means that the right thing to do is nothing. On a\n foggy road, the number and speed of other cars is particularly uncertain. But this very ignorance makes cautious driving essential. The same applied to climate. Given the uncertainties about the climate system, the wisest course is surely to drive cautiou\nsly.’\nAs such, the IPCC’s most recent findings certainly strengthen the economic case for action.\n \nThe speed at which this action happens is equivalent to the ‘choice between stranding those [fossil fuel] assets or stranding the planet’, as stated by the O\nECD Secretary-General, Angel Gurria.\nWhat implications do the IPCC’s conclusions in the AR5 Physical Science Basis report have for policy making both nationally and internationally? Perhaps the most vocal proponent of the carbon budget approach advocated\n by the IPCC is Lord Stern, the former World Bank chief economist and author of the landmark study of the economics of global warming, who says ‘If we continue to increase annual emissions, the budget will be depleted even sooner. I think nations, cities, \ncommunities and companies will recognise the important of these findings and will increase the urgency and scale of the emissions reduction that they are planning to undertake.’\n  \nThis sentiment has been backed by a number of individuals including Richard\n Klein, a scientist with the Stockholm Environment Institute and an IPCC author, who says ‘the potential for increased transparency and accountability that the carbon budget affords may spur some countries to take a second look at their pledges, and encour\nage others to do the same’\n; Tim Yeo, a Conservative MP believes ‘the publication of a carbon budget by the IPCC increases the urgency and importance of the UN process and future COP meetings. Work should start at once on the establishment of a fair apport\nionment of emissions country by country’.\nThis final point\n provides a potentially crucial stumbling block for the influence of the IPCC’s carbon budget in policymaking. Discussion around equity between developed and developing nations, and what weighting \nshould be attributed to historical or present emissions, is already the key area of disagreement in international negotiations. Some see attempting to apportion a carbon budget to each emitter as complicating this process further. Christiana Figueres, exec\nutive director of the UNFCCC said in the run up to the recent COP19 in Warsaw, ‘\nI don’t think it is possible [to allocate carbon budgets]. Politically it would be very difficult. I don’t know who would hold the pen.’\nThe UK Government has a leading position in that it has adopted carbon budgets which outline a pathway to achieving emissions reductions, as agreed in the Climate Change Act. There is a continuing challenge for those budgets to be translated into other pol\nicy measures. \nDelivering the emissions cuts will require an energy transition, which will in turn need financing. This means that investment in the necessary infrastructure must be incentivised by government intervention or the market frameworks that direc\nt capital. \nIt is clear that continuing reliance on fossil fuels is not compatible with achieving the carbon budgets. It is therefore contradictory to continue subsidies for fossil fuel based energy. For example tax-breaks and subsidies which promote the m\nature industry of hydrocarbon extraction are not consistent with the treatment being applied to renewables, where subsidies are tapered off as the costs of the new technologies comes down over time, (eg solar feed-in tariffs). The UK\n’s oil and gas producti\non\n is not large enough to influence global commodity prices of oil and gas. Therefore there is no benefit for consumers of subsidising UK exploration and production, as it wil\nl not bring down energy bills. \nThe current financial system is also not compatib\nle with achieving climate change targets.\n It has been well documented that short-termism, models which are based on historical performance, and rise of passive investing tracking the market leaves most institutional investors holding the incumbents, rather\n than driving the energy transition. Some efforts are underway to package \nclean energy in suitable investment vehicles such as green bonds, and to provide funding through the Green Investment Bank. However\n,\n the other side of the equation is not being addre\nssed. The risks and uncertainty which surround the future of fossil fuels are not being reflected by the market, as it \ncontinues to assume that emissions will rise and revenues will continue to flow as demand and prices are not affected. The financial syst\nem needs to stress test itself against different emissions scenarios, as well as using economic variables.\nThe Climate Change Act also gives powers covering adaptation reporting. We believe it would be timely to have reports on how the energy \nsystem\n and th\ne financial\n regulator\n is adapting to \ndelivering the carbon budget.\n This is not just how they are adapting to the impacts of climate change, but also to the changes required to mitigate climate change.\nWhat relevance do the IPCC’s conclusions have in respect of the review of the fourth Carbon Budget?While a review of the carbon budget does not mean a change will be made, it is clearly a possibility. Consequently, it is worth noting that in theory it can only be altered if there have been significant change in the circumstances on which the budget was \nset, demonstrated by evidence and analysis. \nThe Committee on Climate Change have advised that there have been no significant changes in climate science or international efforts to cut emissions that could warrant a weakening of the carbon budget.\nWith the\n findings of the latest IPCC report, t\nhis is not in doubt. In f\nact, \nthe IPCC’s conclusions \ncould help force a strengthening of the fourth carbon budget given \nin many respects, \nthey \nare their starkest yet\n. \n \nThe AR5 report concluded that global warming is ‘u\nnequivocal’, \nis at least 95% sure that this trend is caused by human activity and temperatures \ncould reach 4.8°C \nhigher than 1990 levels \nby 2100 \nif global emissions continue on their current trajectory. These findings are likely to be influential in policy\nmaking at all levels. Therefore, any weakening of carbon budget restrictions in the UK would diverge from much ambition at EU a\nnd international level, exacerbating the system-level shock which would be necessary at a later date. \nTranslating the carbon bud\nget into the UK’s energy and financial systems will place the UK in a leadership position, as it will already be adapting to a low carbon future and be able to maximise its opportunities. The alternative is that the UK will be left with infrastructure whic\nh is \nincompatible \nw\nith o\nur legislated climate targets, which will become stranded assets and represent a waste of capital for taxpayers and investors.\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.carbontracker.org/wastedcapital\n \n \nhttp://w\nww.climatechange2013.org/images/uploads/WGI_AR5_SPM_brochure.pdf\n \n \nhttp://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cd519de0-55e1-11e3-96f5-00144feabdc0.html?si\nteedition=uk#axzz2lmUa4Tkf\n \n \nhttp://www.oecd.org/about/secretary-general/the-climate-challenge-achieving-zero-emissions.htm\n \n \nhttp://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/29/carbon-budget-talks-urgent-ipcc-lord-stern\n \n \nhttp://www.irinnews.org/report/98891/will-the-climate-change-in-warsaw\n \n \nhttp://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/29/\ncarbon-budget-talks-urgent-ipcc-lord-stern\n \n \nhttp://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/24/ipcc-carbon-budget-warsaw-clima\nte-change-christiana-figueres\n \n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/policies/adapting-to-climate-change\n \nhttp://www.theccc.org.uk/pressreleases/committee-on-climate-change-assessment-of\n-science-and-international-circumstances-reinforces-existing-fourth-carbon-budget/\n \n"
