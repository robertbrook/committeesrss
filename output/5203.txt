[[[ (BRC 78)]]]&#xa0;I'm a sole trader competent electrician and last night I watched the video footage of the hearing last night. I must say I was very pleased to see that you allowed working representatives of the industry address the committee and the exchange was useful.&#xa0;Moving on to the scheme representatives, in the second session I think that there needs to be some follow up as there are a few aspects of the questioning where you could challenge information given and/or clarify points. &#xa0;Specifically:&#xa0;1. The schemes do little or nothing to follow up on reports of poor workmanship, as there isn't a "whistle blowing" mechanism that we can use.&#xa0;2. Schemes have a single membership charge whether the company is a sole trader or a company of 20+ employees with 1 QS - the membership fees need to reflect the numbers of staff. Why should I pay the same?&#xa0;3. As a sole trader, I am checked once per year for the quality of my workmanship, documentation, insurance and calibration certs - companies have their QS checked and the paper trail - SURELY this should be broadened out to inspect the workmanship&#xa0; of each and every person undertaking electrical work, with the possible exception of staff undergoing a formal apprenticeship.&#xa0;4. The schemes seem to be agreeing to a single register, which as I understand it, is still going to "allow" the 6 existing companies to continue to trade - if there is to be 1 register then surely there should be NO&#xa0; need for 6 companies, with duplications of roles and responsibilities across the board which we are funding though our fees.&#xa0;5. Could you ask each of the schemes to submit the numbers of members PLUS the number of jobs notified for the last 5 years? This should establish whether the numbers of members is growing or dropping as most of us suspect.&#xa0;6. There is, under Part P, some belief that it's the homeowners responsibility to ensure that notification of part P is completed. This is a mistake and I believe that the spark should have a specific responsibility to inform each and every customer that Part P exists and that there is a responsibility to notify. Some individuals "hide" behind the fact that if the customer doesn't know, "then who cares"&#xa0;7. On a wider point, it would seem that nobody or organisation is responsible for "policing" the ever growing number of individuals undertaking electrical work in the UK. People from all corners of the earth are coming here, not necessarily understanding the regulations of BS7671 etc and "lowering" standards on a continual basis. &#xa0;I thank you for your time reading this letter and hope that some of it may be included in the next session.&#xa0;Please let me know if you have any questions or would appreciate any aspects of the above expanded upon.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;
