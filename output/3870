defaultAdditional fdefaultollow updefault written evidence from defaultNursing and Midwifery Councildefault (NMC0016)defaultQuestions arising from the evidence sessiondefault1. An update on how many outstanding historic Fitness to Practise cases you have dating from pre 2011; for each case, please could this include the date the case was opened, the stage in your processes that it is currently at, and whether or not the case is subject to a third-party investigation. defaultWe met our target to conclude historic cases with the exception of cases which were outside of our control. On the 30 September there were
default&#xa0;
default47
default&#xa0;
defaulthistoric cases at the adjudication stage of which 40 were part heard hearings (cases that are underway but which have gone part heard due to factors such as the illness of a key participant). Four were scheduled for final fitness to practise hearings and three remain unscheduled due to health or procedural
default&#xa0;
defaultissues. There remained 15 cases at the investigation stage and these were all third party cases, that is cases that cannot proceed due to factors beyond our control such as a police investigation.
default2.  An update on how many Fitness to Practise cases are currently ongoing which were opened between January and December 2011? default428 cases from this period are ongoing, representing 10 per cent of our caseload.
defaultThere were 55 cases from this period at the investigations stage (1.3 per cent of our caseload) of which 33 are on hold due to third party investigations.
defaultThere are 373 cases from this period at the adjudication stage (8.7 per cent of ouR caseload). 200 of these cases are scheduled and 74 per cent are part heard. 27 cases have been held up by third party issues.
default3.  A statement of what you think future KPIs should be for Fitness to Practise targets a) within the current law and b) following possible legislative change arising from the Law Commission report. In each of these instances it would be very helpful if you could highlight the defaulttotaldefault time for a Fitness to Practise case to be concluded, as well as the targets for different components of the Fitness to Practise process.defaultThe DH grant we received in 2012 towards our FtP work was conditional on meeting FtP KPI which are broken down by stage of process. These are
defaultThis equates to an overall length of case target of 18 months. In both cases these targets are to be met by the end of 2014. 
defaultOur high volumes mean it is imperative that we plan to make steady, realistic progress in fitness to practise. Assuming we have successfully met this target by the end of 2014, during which period we will also have introduced case examiners, we envisage proposing to Council a new KPI of 90 per cent of cases progressed within 15 months. This would bring us in line with the performance of the other healthcare regulators, which are managing significantly smaller caseloads. We are happy to propose a start to end target of 15 months rather than targets for individual stages in response to the Committee’s observation that what matters to complainants and registrants is the overall time taken.
defaultAny further significant reduction in the overall length of the FtP cases will only be achievable if the Law Commission’s proposed reforms are enacted and provide a more flexible framework with alternatives to full hearings. Bearing in mind that the Law Commission reforms are unlikely to make it onto the statute book before 2017, in this scenario we would be able to consider a 12 month KPI for cases which are within our power to progress.
default4. An update on how many Fitness to Practise cases in total you have handled arising from Mid Staffs. What has been the outcome of those that have been concluded? How many are still ongoing, and what stage in your Fitness to Practise processes are they at?defaultWe have had a total of 63 cases from Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust. 
default default35 cases were opened proactively by the NMC under article 22(6).
default57 cases have been closed.
default45 cases were closed at the initial stages: 
defaultNine cases went to adjudication:
defaultSix cases remain open:
default5. An explanation of the legislative changes you believe need to be made to enable you to implement language testing for registrants.default&#xa0;default defaultAmendments to the revised Recognition of Professional Qualifications (MRPQ) Directive have been approved by the European Commission, European Parliament and the Council of Ministers. These will come into force in late 2013 and member states will have two years to bring the new requirements into national legislation. 
defaultIn relation to language testing the amended directive recognises its importance and states that regulators should be able to impose language controls. It stipulates that these should take place after the recognition of the qualification, but before access to the profession. The GMC has a licence to practise as well as a register, so it can meet European expectations by registering an EU doctor and then looking at the issue of language skills before granting a licence to practise. For nursing and midwifery, recognition currently gives an individual immediate access to the NMC register (and thus the professions). When the 
defaultUK
default transposes the Directive it would be helpful if the new powers in the resulting 
defaultUK
default legislation could enable us to impose language controls after the recognition of the qualification but before registration. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have begun preliminary discussions with the Department of Health on this issue and we look forward to working with them to create legislation that both meets the requirements of EU law and protects patients.
default&#xa0;
defaultFollow up on other areasdefault&#xa0;
default6. In this year’s performance review report, the PSA express concern that although public protection is the ‘litmus test’ against which all your work is measured, you have not yet identified measures to tell you whether or not that test has been passed. How do you know, and how can we know, that you are protecting the public?default&#xa0;
defaultThe statement that public protection is our ‘litmus test’ originates with our response to the strategic review by the PSA, which was to review all workstreams and cease work which may have been popular with different constituencies but did not make a sufficient contribution to public protection. In other words, the first improvement step was to ensure that all of our work was squarely about public protection.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe PSA is quite right that the next step is to be able to measure the difference we make to public protection, because we need to know the impact of our work as a publicly accountable body and because we need to understand our impact in order to improve as a regulator. Measuring impact is a challenging area for all regulators because it is difficult to isolate the effect of regulation on patient safety from the effects of local policies, employment practices, training, and so on. But we can get better at identifying intermediate measures, such as testing what nurses and midwives understand the code to require of them on a topic, and use that learning to inform improvements.
default&#xa0;
defaultSome of our current KPIs do speak to whether we are protecting the public, particularly those that relate to getting the right people on and off the register, or, in the case of interim orders, preventing or limiting the practice of registrants whose fitness to practise is called into question.
default&#xa0;
defaultFor some other regulatory functions we acknowledge we have more ‘input’ measures than ‘outcome’ ones. For example, when we issue standards or guidance we have control over the quality of the process (Is it evidence based? Did we engage the right stakeholders? Did we take on board feedback?) but less sway over what happens once a document is issued.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are working to effect two cultural changes in this regard:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultExamples of this approach include:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultOur new Council has just embarked on the process of defining a five year strategy and developing as an intelligence-led organisation is one of their clear strategic goals for the period ahead. We will be able to say more about this at our next accountability hearing.
default&#xa0;default7. You stated in your written evidence to this inquiry last year that there had been “no s29 referrals of its decisions by the CHRE (or its successor the PSA) since September 2010”. In evidence to this year’s inquiry the PSA have stated that “this statement does not match our records”. Having now had sight of the PSA evidence, could you please explain the reasons for this discrepancy, and clarify the position on section 29 referrals?defaultOur contention is that there were no successful PSA
default&#xa0;
defaultappeals of NMC decisions since the end of 2010. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe PSA table refers to 3 appeals in 2010 which are not relevant as they related to NMC decisions prior to the end of 2010. 
defaultThe 2011 entry was the case of Wearmouth which was a successful referral (we consented) against a panel decision that was made in 2010. When we have reported on this, we have reported on the date of the relevant panel decision, not the date on which the PSA referral is brought or concluded, because we have considered the former
default&#xa0;
defaultto be the accurate
default&#xa0;
defaultmarker of when the problem occurred. 
defaultThe 2012 entries are as follows:-
defaultWe maintain our position that there were no successful CHRE/PSA referrals of NMC decisions
default&#xa0;
defaultbetween
default&#xa0;
defaultthe end of 2010 and the date of our submission. 
default8. The PSA told us they were surprised that their recent s29 appeal of an NMC decision was not discussed by the Council in their public meeting on September 2013. Why was this? defaultIt was discussed by Council, as the minutes confirm, and we have already informed the PSA that this is the case. It was in confidential rather than public session because it related to an open case.
defaultHealthcare Support Workersdefault9. Has progress been made on establishing training and standards for Healthcare Support Workers?defaultThe NMC understands the Committee’s concerns about standards of practice for this important part of the healthcare workforce. We have no statutory powers to develop training and standards for healthcare support workers but we have encouraged their development by other bodies. We were involved in the steering group for the Skills for Health/Skills for Care initiative to develop training standards and a code for health and social care support workers and we welcomed the recommendation of the Cavendish Review that these be strengthened and taken up. Our powers in this area are to set standards for nurses and midwives and that is why our code provides clear messages about our registrants’ oversight of and ultimate responsibility for work they delegate to others.
defaultRevalidationdefault10. How happy are employers about giving third party input into your revalidation processes? Are there workload concerns?defaultThe NMC has undertaken extensive engagement with key stakeholders from public, private and independent sectors and across the four countries. To assist with ongoing engagement with employers, we have set up an Employers Reference Group.
defaultEmployers have a legitimate interest in the impact of our proposals on their operations. Our current feedback from our employer reference group and other engagement is that where existing appraisal systems are in place the impact should be minimal. Where appraisal systems are not in place, we hope that revalidation will encourage these to be introduced as recommended in the Francis Report.
defaultThe majority of NMC registered nurses and midwives are employed through the NHS. NHS Employers state that effective appraisals are good employment practice, leads to improved staff performance, higher staff satisfaction and better patient outcomes. The NHS Constitution also commits
default&#xa0;
defaultNHS organisations to providing staff with
default&#xa0;
default'clear roles and responsibilities',
default&#xa0;
defaultand 'personal development' and 'line management support to succeed'
default. 
defaultThe information we have received from private sector employers is that there is a very high percentage of appraisals carried out in the private/independent sector. We will explore this further over forthcoming months.
defaultThe NMC plans to produce guidelines to assist in aligning existing appraisal systems with revalidation.
defaultOur forthcoming consultations and pilot sites will provide more further opportunities to gauge and minimise the impact on employers.
default11. How will you secure input from patients? And how will you manage the issue of inconsistency in inputs?defaultThe principle that revalidation should draw on patient and service user feedback is an important one for the NMC, and we recognise the need to manage the sensitivities associated with embedding this principle in a fair and consistent revalidation process. We do not envisage requesting feedback directly from patients in the same manner as the GMC, however we may provide template forms which may assist the nurse or midwife in collecting feedback, as well as guidance on the appropriate times and situations in which to do this.
defaultNurses and midwives practise in a diverse range of roles and settings and some of our current registrants may have little or no direct interaction with patients.  We are conscious of the need to use our engagement around revalidation to develop a model that is meaningful in this varied context.
defaultMost nurses and midwives regularly receive feedback through their day to day practice.
default Stakeholders suggest that 
defaultwe should focus on how the nurse or midwife reflects on the feedback received – positive or negative – and how they incorporate this learning into their practice. It will be the responsibility of the nurse or midwife to confirm that they have received feedback
default.
defaultFitness to Practisedefault12. At your accountability hearing last year, you stated that improving Fitness to Practice performance was an ‘absolute priority’ for the organisation. default&#xa0;defaultWe are currently holding on average 22 to 24 substantive hearings per day and we are looking at appropriate ways of dealing with FtP cases other than full public hearings. We have recently introduced voluntary removal and consensual panel determinations which have reduced the number of cases requiring a full public hearing.
defaultWe have improved our capacity to model fluctuations in referrals and to profile their impact on each stage of the process. This enables us to redirect resources to manage the increased workload at the initial stages of the FtP process. We are also focusi
defaultng on early decision-making by creating a new team to fast track cases where the complaint is unlikely to require regulatory action. 
defaultIn the longer term our regional representatives will work with employers to ensure that appropriate referrals come to the NMC, and other matters are dealt with effectively in settings. 
default&#xa0;defaultBringing most of our investigations in house has given us greater control over timeliness, quality and consistency, and has led to efficiency savings. It has also improved customer service by reducing the number of named contacts on each case and resulted in cost savings.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe meet regularly with the RCN and all the other defence organisations. We listen to the views and concerns of the unions and where appropriate incorporate their ideas, although ultimately the need to protect the public is our over-riding concern.  We have strengthened our customer feedback processes for FtP and we are seeing an improving trend via that route, which is important.
default13. In its performance review, the PSA mentions ‘avoidable procedural errors’ as well as quality of panels’ decision making. What are you doing to address these points?default defaultWe log and investigate all adverse incidents which include procedural errors that have an impact on the smooth running of the FtP process; learning from these incidents is fed back through staff and panel member training. We have developed a process of identifying trends which we use to inform policy and guidance development.
defaultRegistrationdefault 
default14. The PSA highlights several problems with your registration processes. What is being done to improve performance in this area? defaultThe issues that the PSA has raised in connection with registration relate to the standards for re-registration and the timely conduct of registration appeals. We have discussed with the Committee the inadequacy of our current PREP standards and the PSA acknowledges that this is being addressed through the introduction of revalidation. Our intention is for an outcomes-focused perspective on continuing fitness to practise, including third party input. 
defaultThe PSA also highlighted a number of registration appeals (33) outstanding at the point that they gathered their information. All but 4 of these have since been completed within the target timescale. The 4 outstanding cases have been those cases which are novel or complex and most have been subject to previous cancellations by the applicant or their representative. However all of these are scheduled. 
defaultWe expect to have approximately 30 appeals at various stages at any given point in time and work to a target of completing appeals within 8 months, which we have recently reduced from 9 months as part of our performance improvement activities. Registration appeals allow for the submission of new evidence and additional witness statements and therefore time has to be allowed for these activities to complete, the length of which depends on the complexity of the individual cases.
defaultThe reconstitution of Council had a short term impact on appeals while new Council Members completed their induction and appeal panel training activities, but we are currently meeting our performance target.
default15. You have recently identified historical problems relating to registration of nurses arriving from overseas. Can you provide us with some more detail, and assure us on the steps you are taking to address these problems?default defaultAt the end of 2012 we identified concerns about the reliability of historical documentary evidence and the robustness of previous processes. We took action to confirm the extent of any issues, through an independent audit. This initial work identified some weaknesses between 2002-2006, but confirmed that the strengthened overseas processing from 2007 resulted in good assurance of activities with strong controls being in place since that date.  
defaultA more extensive review of historical records has been undertaken and action would be taken where there is any suggestion of inappropriate registration based on the submission of false evidence. This subsequent review has confirmed position identified by the initial scrutiny and has reinforced the good assurance on post 2007 processes.
defaultWe informed the PSA promptly about this work and have kept them informed of our findings and actions.
defaultWe have also now implemented face to face identity and document verification checks for all overseas applicants. This activity is supported by identity document scanning and authentication software.
defaultIn addition we are currently consulting on a new competence test for overseas applicants. The proposed test would cover clinical skills and theoretical knowledge administered within approved centres against current standards for entry to the register. It is intended to introduce the new process incorporating the new competence test in Autumn 2014.
defaultWe have acted responsibly wherever concerns have arisen and further strengthened our processes accordingly but we also need to ensure that our approach is proportionate and that the limitations on a regulator’s ability to provide guarantees on matters of identity fraud are understood.
defaultFinancedefault 
default16. What evidence can you give us that the steps you have taken to address the long-standing and fundamental flaws in the NMC’s financial planning have been effective? defaultThe NMC has implemented all financial recommendations made by the PSA in their 2012 Strategic Review.
default&#xa0;
defaultCouncil approved a comprehensive financial strategy in 2012 which included a robust fee strategy and a revision of the reserves policy to move to a proportionate, ‘risk-based’ reserve level. Progress towards meeting our available free reserve target is a KPI for the NMC and presented to Council at each meeting. It is also presented to the DH at the quarterly accountability meetings to assess progress towards meeting the conditions on which the £20 million grant was based. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe fee strategy was based on detailed three-year projections and the planning horizon is being widened further to 2020 in the current forecasting round. The financial models were externally reviewed for logical integrity, and the assumptions on which the fee strategy was built were also reviewed and endorsed externally. This process will be repeated in future fee strategy development. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultDirectors are now required to complete detailed forecasts on a monthly basis, together with an assessment of progress towards meeting business plan objectives. The monthly management accounts are reviewed at each meeting of the Executive Board, and directors are held to account for the financial performance of their directorate. In the current financial year to date, the projection is that the full year result will be in line with budget. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultEach director is provided with monthly management reports, which have been revised to provide full detailed financial analysis at all levels. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFinancial resource has been strengthened, particularly in relation to Fitness to Practise which utilises the majority of NMC funds. The activity and financial forecasting for FtP has proved to be robust thus far. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default17. What financial data are given to Council and your review groups? What evidence can you give us that they are able to scrutinise and challenge this?default&#xa0;
defaultCouncil is provided with a comprehensive financial paper at each Council meeting. This comprises detailed income and expenditure analysis, key balance sheet indicators including available free reserves and cash, and cash flow. The information is presented for the reporting month, the financial year to date, the full year forecast, and the latest three-year forecast, with variances to budget and the prior month’s forecast. It is accompanied by an executive summary and commentary setting out the key points and any current risks to the financial strategy. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCouncil members are able to question any point or aspect that they wish in each meeting. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhen considering financial strategy and fee levels, Council is provided with comprehensive financial information and a range of appropriate options which detail the impact on available free reserves and therefore the NMC’s financial sustainability. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultCouncil is provided with draft budgets and financial analysis during the budget-setting process, to allow sufficient time for consideration of the final budget for approval. This is presented in conjunction with the draft business plans to ensure there is a clear correlation between proposed activity and financial impact. 
default&#xa0;
defaultA detailed financial induction was provided to the current Council, and individual sessions arranged with senior Finance staff, to ensure that Council members can fully understand the financial context and are in a position to make appropriate challenge where necessary. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultITdefault18. What progress have you made towards stabilising your IT systems since last year’s accountability hearing? Are they finally allowing your staff to complete crucial tasks accurately and efficiently?default 
default&#xa0;
defaultDuring 2013 the NMC has completed the following activities to stabilise our core infrastructure :
defaultDuring November and December 2013 projects will complete to achieve the following milestones.
defaultHowever other critical functionality to improve the stability and capability of the register and enable complete integration between registration and Fitness to Practise is reliant on approval of the strategy by Council prior to the start of the 2014/2015 financial year and is likely to take at least 12 months to complete.
default&#xa0;
default19. You stated that a three-year IT plan would be published in October of this year, yet we understand that this timescale has slipped. What is in the three year plan? What are the resource implications?defaultThe draft IT plan was presented to the Executive Board
default&#xa0;
defaultin September 2013 and will be presented to Council in November for approval of overall direction prior to a detailed business plan for approval before April 2014. The strategic ICT business plan contains the following programmes of work.
defaultInfrastructure
defaultBusiness Applications
defaultThe costs of these programme has been incorporated into the strategic finance strategy.
default20. At the time of the Francis inquiry, it was reported that the NMC’s IT systems could not filter referrals by organisation. Has that changed? What will you do if you identify a pattern?default defaultWe do not currently collect employment data for all registrants, although we do require employment information for registrants involved in fitness to practise cases. During 2013 the case management system has been used to record the employer and setting of registrant referred to Fitness to Practise. During early 2014 the employer and setting data used in the case management system will be reconciled with CQC/GMC data to ensure a consistent approach to coding this data.
defaultWe will be revisiting employer data in the light of implementing revalidation and participating in sector-wide surveillance activity, including regional quality surveillance groups and risk summits. We also recognise that developing a regional presence will potentially generate data about settings that we need to feed into our work more generally, for example in deciding which education providers to monitor.
defaultCouncil effectiveness and quality assurancedefault&#xa0;default21. Your written evidence states that the new Council is now offering ‘appropriate scrutiny and challenge’ – how do you measure the Council’s effectiveness? What data do the Council receive?default&#xa0;defaultThe reconstituted Council took office on 1 May 2013. One of its first tasks was to address the recommendations of an external review of the NMC's governance which had been commissioned following the PSA's strategic review.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Council accepted the recommendations of the governance review which were aimed at (i)
default&#xa0;
defaultenabling the Council to become more
default&#xa0;
defaultboard-like and strategic; (ii) streamlining governance structures and processes; (iii) ensuring that the executive has clear responsibility and accountability for day to day operations.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs part of the work to implement the governance review, the Council has adopted a new scheme of delegation to distinguish clearly between governance and management, reduced the number of Council committees from seven to four, and reviewed the cycle of meetings and business to ensure that they support a more strategic way of working.
default&#xa0;
defaultAt every meeting, the Council receives a performance and risk report that tracks the NMC's key performance indicators,
default&#xa0;
defaultfitness to practise performance,
default&#xa0;
defaultmajor corporate risks and quarterly progress against our Corporate Plan. A separate, detailed financial report is made to every meeting of the Council. Other strategic matters which the Council has considered since May include: the NMC's response to the Francis inquiry and other third party reviews; professional indemnity insurance; revalidation strategy; human resources and organisational development strategy.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Council will review its effectiveness annually as part of the annual reporting process. The effectiveness review will include an appraisal of the individual performance and development needs of Council members as well as a collective assessment of the effectiveness of the Council and its committees. The effectiveness review will inform the annual governance statement that accompanies the annual report and accounts.
default&#xa0;default22. Harry Cayton, Chief Executive of the PSA, told us that as an organisation you can now do everything you need to do well, but you cannot do it well “all the time and every time”. What systems have you put in place to quality assure your own processes? What management data do you now have?default&#xa0;
defaultIn July 2013 Council agreed a corporate quality assurance strategy. The strategy is risk based and
default&#xa0;
defaultfocussed on continuous improvement.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt has three outcomes:
defaultAll
default&#xa0;
defaultdirectorates are
default working on the first outcome which is due to be fully implemented by October 2014. This includes defining quality for each area of the work; ensuring that managers have the tools they need to manage performance and quality; putting in place arrangements for peer reviews and setting up local quality assurance arrangements. Once the framework is in place we will have three tiers of assurance, which is accepted good practice. The three tiers are:
default&#xa0;
defaultmanagerial oversight; QA team reviews and review by internal auditors and others including the PSA.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe now have
default&#xa0;
defaulta quality assurance (QA) team lead by an assistant director, which is responsible for the delivery of the second outcome. It has a programme of reviews covering all areas of our work. Thus far it has

default&#xa0;

defaultOn the third outcome we are developing a learning framework.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis will include

defaulta corporate database of organisational learning,
default&#xa0;
defaultderived from a range of sources including:
defaultEach area of the
default business will then develop actions plans to address the learning identified and the QA team will check that the necessary changes have been made. 
defaultWe have made considerable progress in improving the quality of our management information.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have developed a new set of
default&#xa0;
defaultKPIs which are reported to Council
default&#xa0;
defaulttogether with a
default&#xa0;
defaultdashboard of FtP information. Other areas of the business are developing quality management information.
defaultStaff morale and turnoverdefault default23. You appear to be making some progress in reducing your staff turnover, but the current figure of 26.9% is still high. What have you done to tackle high staff turnover over the past year? What will you do next?defaultStaff turnover is being managed through a combination of measures including an organisational pay and benefits review, investment in staff development particularly around behaviours, and management training.
default&#xa0;
default The pay and grading review is under consultation and will replace an old inflexible pay system with a new system that is based on market data, creates separate job families which have their own pay levels to match market pay, thus enabling the
default&#xa0;
defaultNMC to attract, recruit and retain staff.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition the organisation is consulting on a range of employee benefits (both pay and non pay), including implementing a contribution based pension scheme to meet auto enrolment requirements and provide a flexible pension to meet the needs of employees as identified in the staff survey and through staff engagement events.
default&#xa0;
default     
defaultOther elements include improved staff engagement through senior managers involving staff at briefings, lunchtime meetings, and spending time in directorate teams. Action plans are in place to address results from the staff survey, which demonstrate to staff that we are acting upon feedback through listening to their views. We are implementing a learning and development programme that focuses on the theme of coaching which will be launched during 2014, and will be building upon the management development programme to ensure all managers are supported to improve their capabilities. Another staff survey is planned for next year to benchmark against this year’s survey to measure improvements. The latest monthly figure for staff turnover shows a continuous reduction
default&#xa0;
defaultfrom 26.9% in August to 26% in September, which demonstrates an improvement from July figure of 28.2%.
defaultOverseas registrationdefault 
default24. You also raise some further issues relating to the EU recognition of professional qualifications directive – could you expand on these please? defaultWe have a number of concerns about parts of the amended Directive and we outline some of these below. These relate to both the constraints on the NMC’s regulatory functions when it comes to processing applications for registration, and the impact on regulators in terms of cost set against benefits to public protection (as distinct from labour market mobility). We are in discussions with the DH about our concerns however and we hope to clarify and mitigate issues as part of the transposition process. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFive areas of concern for the NMC arising from amendments to the Directive are:
default&#xa0;defaultEU Professional Carddefault – The European Professional Card is being introduced by the Directive and would be an electronic form of recognition. It would be operated through the NMC linking with the Internal Market Information Systems (IMI) operated by the European Commission, through which applications for registration would be transacted. We have significant concerns about the impact of the card both in terms of cost and the fact that it places greater responsibility and power over recognition with the regulator in the nurse or midwife’s home member state. Thus it would constrain the NMC’s ability to impose checks on who enters its own register. We have additional concerns about the process by which the Commission is engaging with stakeholders to discuss the card, which to date has not included regulators who would be expected to operate any new system.
default&#xa0;defaultPartial Access to the Registerdefault – Where an applicant’s qualifications have such shortfalls that they cannot be made up by compensation measures (for example through a period of adaptation), a new provision in the Directive would allow for partial access to the profession. This is a clear public safety risk. Safeguards have now been put in place in the Directive and most nurses and midwives will not be covered by this new requirement. However we remain concerned that a small group of nurses and midwives would be subject to this requirement and the NMC may thus face legal challenge from a migrant. We hope to mitigate this risk as part of the transposition and will hold discussions with the DH on this issue.
default&#xa0;defaultAlert Mechanismdefault – The amended Directive will require the NMC to inform all other regulators in the EU and upload (via the EU’s IMI system) all our fitness to practise decisions in a condensed timeframe. Although we welcome the patient safety benefits that this would bring this does present a significant ICT and resource impact for the NMC. As the NMC deals with the largest number of fitness to practise cases this will also put pressure of IMI and recipient member states.
default&#xa0;
defaultLanguage testingdefault – as set out in our response to Q.5 above
default&#xa0;defaultTemporary provision of services default– the NMC continues to be concerned that nurses and midwives are able to travel to the 
defaultUK
default and provide services on a temporary basis without registration. Although the NMC is able to check the qualifications of the migrant and they are required to declare that they intend to provide services, we are unable to apply our full registration process to these individuals. We are also not able to require professional indemnity insurance even though this will soon be a statutory requirement for registration for all other nurses and midwives registered with the NMC.
default&#xa0;
defaultHigh court ruling on lack of competence default25. It has recently emerged that a High Court ruling is effectively preventing the NMC from striking off nurses or midwives on the grounds of ‘lack of competence’. Could you please explain the situation to the Committee, set out for the Committee how you are dealing with this to ensure that public protection is maintained, and set out what actions you are taking to rectify this situation on a more long-term basis?defaultIn February of this year, a High Court ruling established that the wording of the NMC’s current legislation means that nurses or midwives cannot be struck off the register on the grounds of 
defaulthealthdefault or 
defaultlack of competencedefault, unless they have been suspended continuously for two years, through the issuing of a suspension order after a finding of impairment. The midwife in question had been suspended for almost four years, but through interim orders rather than a suspension order after a finding of impairment. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe judge in the case made a further comment that in his view the wording of the Nursing and Midwifery Order 2001, the basis for the our powers, meant that a finding of lack of competence could never result in striking off. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe NMC’s powers to strike off nurses or midwives for 
defaultmisconductdefault remain unchanged. The terms ‘misconduct’ and ‘lack of competence’ have no statutory definition, and in practice there may be a degree of overlap between the two. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe NMC is currently in discussion with the Department of Health about using a Section 60 order to change legislation to address this issue; plans are apparently at an advanced stage, with the possibility of the changes being brought in by the middle of 2014. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMeanwhile, we are dealing with the practical implications of this ruling by advising their Fitness to Practice panels not to make striking off orders on the grounds of health or lack of competence, but instead to make a suspension order. In terms of public protection this will have the same effect, removing the registrant’s ability to practise, and the suspension order can be renewed indefinitely on an annual cycle.

defaultRaising Concerns guidancedefault2default6. defaultDuring the session, your Chair and Chief Executive referred to guidance for nurses and midwives which the NMC had relaunched. They said that the guidance was to reinforce nurses’ and midwives’ duties to report concerns with employers and, where necessary, to the NMC or other regulatory bodies.default&#xa0;default The Raising Concerns guidance appears not to cover raising concerns with the NMC. Can you clarify?defaultWe have reviewed the text of our Raising Concerns guidance in response to the Committee’s question, and reflecting on the exchange in our oral evidence about raising concerns, after which we felt we needed to do more to convey the difference between concerns that might most usefully be channelled to professional, and systems, regulators.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe raising concerns guidance advises registrants to voice concerns locally first because that is where they may be resolved most effectively and efficiently, and this is in the interests of everyone. This is also recognised best practice suggested by employers, unions, and Public Concern at Work, whose expertise was drawn on in drafting the guidance. However we make it clear that concerns can be raised immediately with regulators if circumstances require, and that registrants can come directly to what is stage 4 in our diagram on 
defaultpp 12-13. We then direct registrants
default to a list of regulators on pp 21-22 and
default&#xa0;
defaultthe NMC's own contact details are not in that list. They are of course elsewhere in the document but for the avoidance of doubt we will now include them here.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultReflecting on
default&#xa0;
defaultthe experience of our oral evidence, we also think there is merit in adding a statement abou
defaultt the different paths
default for 'system' issues and 'professional issues', while making it clear that if a registrant is not sure what are dealing with they should raise the concern anyway. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe will effect these changes as soon as possible and hope they go some way to addressing your point.
default&#xa0;
defaultOur forthcoming protocol with the CQC will assist us in ensuring that if either organisation becomes aware of concerns more relevant to the remit of the other, those are systematically shared. We have written to the system regulators of the other 
defaultUK
default nations to invite them to work with us on similar protocols in 2014.
default&#xa0;
defaultNearly 8,000 people have viewed the guidance on our website since it was relaunched and nearly 2,000 have viewed Helene Donnelly’s launch presentation
default, 
defaultso we are encouraged that the guidance is being taken up and we want it to be as
default&#xa0;
defaultuse
defaultful as it can be.
