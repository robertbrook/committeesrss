defaultWritten evidence submitted by Dr Ruth Dixon (IPC0023)defaultI am submitting this evidence on the subject of 
defaultscrutiny and 
defaultreview of the IPCC report. I am not associated with the IPCC 
defaultand my evidence is drawn from published sources
default. I have undertaken academic research and teaching at the Universi
defaultty of Oxford since 19
default86. I am the author or 
defaultco-author
default of
default over 50 peer-reviewed publications 
defaultin
default the natural sciences (
defaultc
defaulthemistry and 
defaultb
defaultiochemistry) and the social sciences. I have also reviewed numerous papers for academic journals. 
defaultThe views in this evidence are my own, and do 
defaultnot represent the views of my employer or any other organization.
default 
defaultThe Review Process for IPCC ReportsdefaultSummarydefaultMy evidence addresses the Committee’s questions: 
default‘
defaultHas the IPCC adequately addressed criticisms of previous reports?default’ and default‘defaultTo what extent does AR5 reflect the range of views among climate scientists?default’default‘
defaultThis independent review of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was undertaken by the InterAcademy
default Council (IAC) under a $950,000 contract signed in April 2010 with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
default.
default’  
defaultThe 
defaultIAC Review
default Committee convened for the purpose comprised twelve experts under the chairmanship of Harold Shapiro, professor of economi
defaultcs and public affairs at Princeton University, USA.
default‘
defaultCoordinating Lead Authors and Lead Authors have considerable influence over which viewpoints will be discussed
default.
default 
defaultHaving
default 
defaultauthor teams with diverse viewpoints is the first st
defaultep toward ensuring that
default 
defaulta full range of 
defaultthoughtful views are considered. 
defaultEqually important is combating confirmation bias—the tendency of authors to place too much weight on their own views relative to other views [
defaultcitation
default]
default.
default As pointed out to the Committe
defaulte by a presenter and some questionnaire respondents, alternative views are not always cited in a chapter if the Lead Authors do not agree with them. Getting the balance right is an ongoing struggle.
default’
default 
defaultThe review recommended that
default:
default 
default‘
defaultLead Authors should 
defaultexplicitly document that a range of scientific viewpoints has been considered, and  coordinating Lead Authors and Review Editors should satisfy themselves that due consideration was given to properly documented alternative views
default.
default’
default‘
defaultA near-universal observation—made in presentations, interviews, and responses to the questionnaire—was the need to strengthen the authority of the Review Editors to ensure that authors consider the 
defaultreview comments carefully and document their responses. With a tight schedule for completing revisions, authors do not always do an adequate job of revising the text, and Review Editors do not always require an explanation for rejected comments. In the cas
defaulte of the incorrect projection of the disappearance of the Himalayan glaciers, for example, some of the review comments were not adequately considered and the justifications were not completely explained (see Box 2.1). Although a few errors are likely to be
default missed in any review process, stronger enforcement of existing IPCC procedures by the Review Editors could minimize their number. This includes paying special attention to review comments that point out contradictions, unreferenced literature, or potentia
defaultl errors; and ensuring that alternate views receive proper consideration.
default’ 
defaultThe IAC Review
default recommend
defaulted
default that the role of Review Editors should be strengthened, 
defaultbut
default noted 
defaultthat even if that were done ‘
defaultit would not make the review process truly independent bec
defaultause the Working Group Co-chairs, who have overall responsibility for the preparation of the reports, are also responsible for selecting Review Editors.
default’ 
defaultThe IAC Review suggested that the IPCC should consider instituting a completely independent review pro
defaultcess.
