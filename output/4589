[normal]Q84 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you very much. I will welcome you all in a moment, but just a few points. The session will last approximately 50 to 60 minutes and members of the Committee with relevant interests will declare these now. Are there any interests? Yes, Lady Valentine.
[normal]Baroness Valentine:[bold] Terry Morgan is Chairman of the London First Employment and Skills Group.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] You happen to know each other. I should think that is probably an advantage. Thank you.
[normal]Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:[bold] I was on a Select Committee that dealt with the legislation on Crossrail.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] I see, right. Now, the session is on record and is being webcast live and will be subsequently accessible via the parliamentary website. Witnesses will receive a transcript of the session to check and correct and this will be put on the public record in printed form and on the parliamentary website. I will ask the witnesses, starting with Tanith Dodge on my left, to state for the record your names and official titles because we need it for the record for the transcribers.
[normal]Tanith Dodge[bold]: Tanith Dodge, 
[normal]d
[normal]irector of HR, 
[normal]Marks &amp; Spencer
[normal].
[normal]Terry Morgan[bold]: Terry Morgan, 
[normal]c
[normal]hairman of Crossrail.
[normal]Jez Langhorn[bold]: Jez Langhorn, senior vice-president, people, 
[normal]at McDonald’s.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Thank you very much indeed. I invite you to make an opening statement, if anybody wants to make a brief opening statement.
[normal]Tanith Dodge[bold]: As an employer, Marks 
[normal]&amp;
[normal] Spencer run a number of youth employment programmes. Specifically, we run a programme called Make Your Mark, which focuses on young people in unemployment under the age of 24. We provide vocational work experience. We also run a number of training programmes, graduate programmes and A-level programmes, so as a company we have quite a bit of experience of supporting young people in the world of work.
[normal]Terry Morgan[bold]: I am 
[normal]c
[normal]hairman of Crossrail, but I also have additional responsibilities as chair, as 
[normal]Lady Valentine
[normal] has said, of the London First Skills and Employment Group. I also chair a national skills academy for railway engineering and a manufacturing technology centre that has been established in the 
[normal]West Midlands
[normal]. I will predominantly talk about Crossrail. From the point of view of Crossrail, we have made it a precondition that if companies want to contract with Crossrail they have to employ somebody who is 
[normal]either 
[normal]an apprentice or currently unemployed for every £3 million worth of contract value. That means we had a target of 400 apprentices. To date, we have 269 and we have taken 750 people through pre-employment training who have been generally successful in finding employment as a consequence of that. I think it is really important that you lead from the point of view of how you create an opportunity for young people to be employed rather than concern about immigration having an impact on unemployment. The emphasis for me is about opportunities.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Indeed. Thank you very much. Mr Langhorn?
[normal]Jez Langhorn[bold]: Good afternoon. McDonald’s, for context, operates 1,250 restaurants across the 
[normal]UK
[normal] and we employ 95,000 people, 60% of whom are aged 16 to 24. We are a very large employer of young people. We have been offering qualifications to those people for the past seven years. We currently run an apprenticeship scheme that delivers around 5,000 level 2 apprenticeships every year, so we are one of the largest private sector providers of apprenticeships in the 
[normal]UK
[normal]. We also provide other qualifications for those 
[normal]who
[normal] leave school without them, such as Maths and English. So
[normal]me
[normal] 350 people gain a Maths or English GCSE-level qualification funded by McDonald’s with 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment support every single month to those 
[normal]who 
[normal]did not have them before. McDonald’s is also a big supporter of our sector skills council, People 1st, and 
[normal]of 
[normal]pre-employment training to help people into the hospitality industry.
[normal]Q85 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Thank you very much. That sounds all very impressive. In fact, it nearly negates my first question, which was: could you describe for us, please, your involvement with young people as employees or trainees and how recruitment of this group has changed during the course of the current economic downturn? It would be useful to know the trend since the economic downturn, if you could give us some information about that. As you obviously have a handle on this issue, particularly the apprenticeships, do you have any publicly printed material or anything that you could send us for our benefit? 
[normal]W
[normal]e have really been homing in on 
[normal]apprenticeships 
[normal]and we have come up against a brick wall so many times, whereas here immediately there is an enthusiasm for apprenticeship schemes. 
[normal]I take it that in 
[normal]McDonald’s
[normal] particularly
[normal], you take them from the age of 16
[normal].
[normal]Jez Langhorn[bold]: We do.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]Sixteen 
[normal]to 18 year-olds 
[normal]are 
[normal]the big gap where they go missing, so 
[normal]we would be grateful 
[normal]if anybody 
[normal]could answer on 
[normal]that. I did not hear, Ms Dodge, whether or not you have apprenticeship schemes.
[normal]Tanith Dodge[bold]: We do not specifically have apprenticeship schemes. We run a number of 
[normal]schemes that are 
[normal]all but in the same guise as apprenticeship schemes
[normal],
[normal] but they are not a recognised body. We do a lot of training on the shop floor and they get an in-house accreditation. One of the barriers to apprenticeship schemes is 
[normal]that 
[normal]there are very few bodies that are nationwide that will give the accreditation in all the locations where we operate. There is also, unfortunately, still quite a bit of bureaucracy. There is a lot of paperwork and certain ways 
[normal]in which 
[normal]you have to provide the training, which does not always work for us.
[normal] W
[normal]e would be much more supportive of an accreditation that a company like 
[normal]Marks &amp; Spencer
[normal] gets that recognises what we do as opposed to 
[normal]forces us
[normal] to do it in a certain way to meet the criteria. We have looked at it many, many times. There is a huge willingness to do it, but it would add a lot more process and bureaucracy to the way we do the training today.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] That is very interesting. Mr Morgan, do you find that 
[normal]operating the apprenticeships
[normal] is a very bureaucratic process?
[normal]Terry Morgan[bold]: The bureaucracy can always frustrate you. You just have a determination 
[normal]that 
[normal]it is not going to stop you. Certainly, in our experience—and I use it as an example of why we do it—we have placed a lot of contracts, billions of pounds worth of contracts, over the last three or four years. We are keen on it because we believe it is an important legacy issue for a huge infrastructure project like ours. Guess what? The companies 
[normal]that do 
[normal]the most in apprenticeships and give people 
[normal]an opportunity 
[normal]to be employed locally in the businesses are our best contractors. They get the message. The best companies do this quite naturally.
[normal]Q86 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] That is very interesting. I take it 
[normal]that 
[normal]it is the same with McDonald’s
[normal].
[normal] That is a very impressive record that you have
[normal]:
[normal] a new group of 5,000 apprentices employed each year. What happens to the 5,000 at the end of one year? Do they carry on? Is the apprenticeship scheme more than one year?
[normal]Jez Langhorn[bold]: It is. The apprenticeship scheme is a minimum of one year. Some will take a year
[normal],
[normal] some will take longer depending on their needs. All of them go on to full-time jobs with us or part-time roles, whatever their role is. They are all permanent jobs that come out of the apprenticeship.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Very briefly now, has your recruitment c
[normal]hanged during the course of the 
[normal]current economic downturn? Is there a marked difference from, say, prior to 2008 and now?
[normal]Jez Langhorn[bold]: 
[normal]N
[normal]early a million people a year apply to work at McDonald’s. It is obviously 
[normal]predominantly 
[normal]a large number of young people 
[normal]who 
[normal]apply to work for us, and we hire around 25,000 people each year. Although our turnover, our churn rate, is quite low, a lot of it is linked to the education cycles; maybe young people will work for us during A levels or degrees. The average hourly paid staff member stays with us for three and a half years and managers stay with us 15 years. Out of that million applications, we also think it is important that we help young people who are not successful to build their CV. We also point them in other directions
[normal]:
[normal] to our sector skills council and to organisations such as vInspired so that they can either use volunteering or add to their CV in some way. We have found, though, that we hire people on their qualities, not just their qualifications. We have a really broad church of people working for us, those who maybe did not do well at GCSE level working shoulder to shoulder with master’s degree students who are topping up their fees. That leads to a really rich, diverse set of employees.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]That is very good, very useful.
[normal]Q87 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]Baroness Hooper:[bold] On the question of the very impressive numbers of apprenticeships that McDonald’s has, what is the dropout rate, if indeed there are any dropouts?
[normal]Jez Langhorn[bold]: I will come back to you with the exact number of our success rate—
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] If you could.
[normal]Jez Langhorn[bold]: —but it is something we monitor very closely and it is a very high success rate. It is above industry average.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Well, it would be.
[normal]Jez Langhorn[bold]: We are inspected by Ofsted, as any learning organisation
[normal] is
[normal]. 
[normal]In o
[normal]ur last Ofsted inspection we rated very good
[normal],
[normal] with many areas outstanding, including that governance.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Of course, the three of you represent leading edge, so to speak, and places where people would want jobs. Do you think that the way you are dealing with all this
[normal],
[normal] the way you employ these people and structure the apprenticeships
[normal],
[normal] has messages for the rest of the country
[normal] and 
[normal]for all these people who are unemployed?
[normal]Terry Morgan[bold]: Can I come back to the bureaucratic question? If you allow civil servants to run this process you will end up with what you have just described. The front end will do what you have just described, but it is really important that this initiative should be 
[normal]employer-led
[normal]. Employers can impact the supply chain in a much more effective way.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Rather than 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment-
[normal]led?
[normal]Terry Morgan[bold]: Totally. Government can help. Obviously, I have a very strong view that 
[normal]the Government, 
[normal]with 
[normal]their procurement, 
[normal]could help 
[normal]to 
[normal]direct how companies 
[normal]even more that 
[normal]want to contract on the public sector expenditure make a commitment.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] They set the climate and you do the work?
[normal]Terry Morgan[bold]: Yes.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] That is very interesting. Any more questions on that?  
[normal]Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:[bold] Tanith Dodge
[normal], 
[normal]you decided not to have a formal apprenticeship scheme. What difference does it make to you whether or not you have a formal recognised apprenticeship scheme?
[normal]Tanith Dodge[bold]: The most important thing is that we are giving young people the opportunity to work. Our programmes are developing their employability and customer service skills. It is very similar to an apprenticeship but it does not have the formal accreditation because there is not one body that provides that accreditation for the whole of the 
[normal]UK
[normal]. We would have to go to five different bodies.
[normal] 
[normal]One of the programmes that we are working with a number of other employers on is a programme called Movement to Work. Working with the Government we are joining other organisations
[normal],
[normal] and that is where it becomes very powerful. We have signed up 14 other companies in the FTSE
[normal] 
[normal]100, companies like BT, Barclays, Diageo and so on, and have an aspiration to provide work experience to 100,000 young people over the next 18 months and to roll it out through our supplier base. If each of those companies talked to all their suppliers to do something similar, who then talked to all their suppliers, you would get this accelerator.
[normal] 
[normal]One of the many attractions of it is it aims at making it as easy as possible, particularly for SMEs, to be involved and provide work experience to young people
[normal],
[normal] because we are sharing knowledge, experience, one toolkit, to make it easier for organisations to roll it out. That is happening now. We have in our first year taken on about 1,000 and, of those, 80% have gone into meaningful work.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Was that your own initiative or was it prompted by 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment?
[normal]Tanith Dodge[bold]: It was our own initiative.
[normal]Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:[bold] It is very impressive what you do. Is there anything you are forgoing by not having formal apprenticeship schemes?
[normal]Tanith Dodge[bold]: No.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Of course, it is more diverse, is it not, th
[normal]an the construction industry as 
[normal]such or the food and hospitality industries
[normal].
[normal] It could be
[normal].
[normal] I do not know.
[normal]Terry Morgan[bold]: I could be persuaded either way. I just think there is a choice here. In my opinion, what gets missed is that very often youngsters have some difficulty in choosing what careers they want to follow, and by trying to move away from vocational training being a condition of applicants who have failed the academic route we have to change that. Certainly, one of the things that I think 
[normal]is 
[normal]missing is the whole trail 
[normal]of 
[normal]those who have done very well with us vocationally. One of the things that we have learnt is that youngsters decide that they want to transfer to an academic career but 
[normal]change 
[normal]at a later stage because they know better what they want to do and at least they have the vocational skill behind them.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] And workability.
[normal]Terry Morgan[bold]: Absolutely.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Yes. Lord Brooke, you wanted to ask a quick one on that.
[normal]Q88 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:[bold] Yes, thank you, Lord Chairman. There is a lot of debate about that. It is interesting listening to the 
[normal]Marks &amp; Spencer
[normal] contribution because there is a lot of debate about the quality of apprenticeships and what an apprenticeship is. Some people say, “We are now offering apprenticeships
[normal]”,
[normal] which really are no more than vocational training. In that sense, is 
[normal]Marks &amp; Spencer
[normal] perhaps being very honest and straightforward in its approach, leaving aside the issue about bureaucracy?
[normal]Tanith Dodge[bold]: The training 
[normal]that 
[normal]we provide we 
[normal]provide 
[normal]in a way that suits our business needs. It is very good training. Most of the individuals go on to full-time employment and become managers in our organisations. It has a very high success rate. If we moved into the apprenticeship route, and we would really like to move into the apprenticeship route, the way we do the training would have to be different.
[normal]Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:[bold] You would like to?
[normal]Tanith Dodge[bold]: First of all, if there was one body that we could work with that 
[normal]was
[normal] nationwide
[normal] we would
[normal], b
[normal]ecause working with five bodies, 
[normal]f
[normal]ive different ways of doing it and 
[normal]five different sets of certificates makes it
[normal] very difficult, 
[normal]and we are very confident that the way we do it today works extremely well.
[normal]Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:[bold] Who provides that infrastructure if we try to make the changes? Is it the Government or is it the industry itself that comes together and does it?
[normal]Tanith Dodge[bold]: 
[normal]I
[normal]t is both, but it is 
[normal]mainly 
[normal]the industry.
[normal]Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:[bold] It is the industry that is failing there?
[normal]Tanith Dodge[bold]: 
[normal]T
[normal]here is not one joined-up body.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] She is not going to say that.
[normal]Tanith Dodge[bold]: No, I did not say that. There is not one specific body representing the whole of retail that is nationwide in the 
[normal]UK
[normal].
[normal]Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:[bold] If I may just conclude on this, it is very interesting for us to try to find who is responsible at the end of the day for making it work best.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Yes, and what system is the best, too, but the system obviously differs depending on the sector.
[normal]Tanith Dodge[bold]: Yes, it does. It differs by sector and by industry.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Lord Haskel, you wanted to have a quick question.
[normal]Lord Haskel:[bold] The work you do is very impressive. Do you go a bit further and have, for instance, an incubator scheme where you can get young people starting up their own business with your assistance and then you become associated with them
[normal], o
[normal]r is that a step too far?
[normal]Terry Morgan[bold]: It is not a step too far. You used the example of 
[normal]an 
[normal]incubator, but when you talk about young people I also think of the whole question 
[normal]of 
[normal]diversity. How do young people make choices about which career they follow? I would suggest
[normal], although 
[normal]I suspect I could be challenged
[normal], that 
[normal]in my sector males dominate and in retail females dominate. We are very keen to try to change that, so we 
[normal]have
[normal] our young people
[normal], 
[normal]because I am too old for this
[normal], 
[normal]going into schools to try to influence particularly women about choices, about a career like construction or in an infrastructure programme of the sort that we are developing. We have no problems getting males, so it is a question of trying to get more diversity. On the question of start-up
[normal]s
[normal], we run an innovation process but it is very immature
[normal] right now
[normal], to be frank with you.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Thank you. That has been fantastic, a very good opening session. 
[normal]Q89 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Lord Clinton-Davis:[bold] 
[normal]Some 
[normal]young people 
[normal]have
[normal] great difficulty in finding jobs and keeping them. Is it due to a lack of opportunities 
[normal]for them,
[normal] or is it due to any other reasons?
[normal]Jez Langhorn[bold]: It is a combination
[normal],
[normal] because being a young person today is quite tough in the current economic climate. Jobs are scarcer than they were, but many young people still leave school without Maths and English qualifications. I think the latest statistics were 
[normal]that 
[normal]65% of children achieved five GCSEs, including Maths and English, which leaves 35% who did not. It is very important that big, responsible companies offer those people the chance to still gain qualifications once they have left the traditional academic environment. I know 
[normal]that 
[normal]in our situation many young people will gain qualifications
[normal],
[normal] and they mature 
[normal]at
[normal] 16 to 17 and 18. An 18 year-old is very different 
[normal]from 
[normal]a 16 year-old. Gaining that qualification not only boosts their skills but their confidence. That is very important for young people. In many situations, that enables them then 
[normal]to 
[normal]get back into traditional academic routes as well. For example, if you do not have a Maths or English qualification and you gain that at McDonald’s, many young people then go back into full-time education because they can then get on to the course that they wanted to do because they now have that Maths or English qualification that they did not get in the traditional academic route. It is important that we do not close the door on those opportunities to get formally recognised qualifications once young people have left the traditional academic route.
[normal]Lord Clinton-Davis:[bold] 
[normal]I
[normal]f young people have worthwhile qualifications, do they find difficulties even then?
[normal]Jez Langhorn[bold]: Well, I would say 
[normal]that 
[normal]we have managed to grow our business successfully over the last few years. In fact, over the last five years we have created 30,000 new jobs. We have gone from having 65,000 to 95,000.
[normal]Lord Clinton-Davis:[bold] You talk about new jobs, but do you differentiate between people who are getting paid the minimum amount and people who are not even qualified for that?
[normal]Jez Langhorn[bold]: 
[normal]W
[normal]e will employ people based on their skills as well as their qualifications and give them the opportunity to grow and progress. I go back to my earlier comment. I think it is tough being a young person and it is incumbent on the big companies to help those young people get the skills and confidence to get the jobs that are out there.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] It is the other face of corporate responsibility.
[normal]Terry Morgan[bold]: Can I add something to this? When you talked about young people who have some degree of capability, we often find that that capability is not matched to the job market. That is a key issue
[normal] that goes 
[normal]back to my point about pre-employment: how much help do young people get about choices? Where are there likely to be worthwhile careers? Seeing somebody at 21 with high expectations but with a degree I ca
[normal]nnot use obviously d
[normal]isappoints the individual. Again, I think 
[normal]that 
[normal]a lot more effort needs to be put into balancing.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] By whom?
[normal]Terry Morgan[bold]: 
[normal]T
[normal]his is interesting. Can I use a story that is absolutely true? We bought some equipment from 
[normal]Germany
[normal]. It is the only piece of equipment that we bought that was fairly major, 
[normal]and it 
[normal]employed 2,000 people. I went into that company and guess how many apprentices they had
[normal]? Four hundred
[normal].
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] I am not surprised.
[normal]Terry Morgan[bold]: It is massive. It is 
[normal]private-
[normal]company led
[normal],
[normal] but the regional government support
[normal]s
[normal] it. It is that level of integration that you are looking for. Who can do what in key roles? I guarantee you 
[normal]that 
[normal]those 400 apprenticeships were 
[normal]doing things I did 50 years ago that 
[normal]would not be done today in the 
[normal]UK
[normal], but they were being given very basic vocational skills and being trained to do work that fits the job market.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] That is the culture of 
[normal]Germany
[normal]. It has been ever thus, certainly in the last 30 years or so. They go especially for apprenticeships where we have let them drop.
[normal]Terry Morgan[bold]: I aspire to achieve the same thing. That is what we are doing on a project like Crossrail. We should have that ambition.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Yes. No comment from you on that one?
[normal]Tanith Dodge[bold]: A couple of things from your question. One, we are definitely seeing an increase in the number of applicants that we get, particularly on A-level programmes
[normal] and 
[normal]graduate programmes. It is doubling. 
[normal]But 
[normal]we are also seeing particularly school leavers lacking basic employability skills, 
[normal]such as 
[normal]communication, self-esteem, confidence. We see 
[normal]them 
[normal]getting into a vicious cycle: they lack
[normal] the confidence, 
[normal]they apply for jobs
[normal], 
[normal]they are turned down
[normal], and 
[normal]they are not given the opportunity. 
[normal]The question 
[normal]is how we break that cycle. Education has a part to play in that, doing more on employability skills. Large employers have a role to play
[normal],
[normal] and I think the Government 
[normal]have
[normal] a role to play. As we are seeing a much more transient workforce, 
[normal]there needs to be 
[normal]some recognised passport or accreditation
[normal]. Y
[normal]ou 
[normal]can 
[normal]do a programme with M&amp;S and at the end go to another company and do a programme with them, but there is no accreditation across different programmes at all. I think that would be very helpful for young people.
[normal]Q90 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]Lord Freeman:[bold] 
[normal]Good afternoon. 
[normal]May I ask an unloaded question? What is the proportion for each of your companies of young people coming into employment from abroad, principally from the European Union?
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] It is unloaded.
[normal]Jez Langhorn[bold]: In McDonald’s, 80% of our hires each year are 
[normal]UK
[normal] nationals. Of the remainder the vast majority will be EU nationals. That is the situation at McDonald’s.
[normal]Terry Morgan[bold]: I would say it is similar 
[normal]with us 
[normal]but I would like to provide that information to you. The difficulty you sometimes get into, of course, is that 
[normal]when you are dealing with post
[normal] codes you do not necessarily know the nationality of the individual. I will revert back to you on that if I may.
[normal] 
[normal]I 
[normal]would 
[normal]say, though, working in 
[normal]London
[normal], that
[normal] there is a skills need. Our ambition has been to try to provide that locally and we will rely on immigration to fill the gaps as and when they arise. It is 
[normal]a question of 
[normal]which way round you do it. Do young people not get jobs because of immigration
[normal],
[normal] or are we working hard enough with young people to minimise the level of immigration? The latter is the way I would like 
[normal]it 
[normal]to be.
[normal]Tanith Dodge[bold]: It is similar
[normal] with us. It is about 80:
[normal]20
[normal],
[normal] but I would want to confirm the exact number.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Thank you. You can always write back to us on anything like this. Can I also just say at this stage 
[normal]that 
[normal]if there is anything else that you think we should have considered, please feel free to write to us?
[normal]Baroness Hooper:[bold] I think we have already established that you believe that the response to youth unemployment should be 
[normal]employer-led
[normal]. Do you think that all employers live up to these responsibilities
[normal],
[normal] and do you see a push to do this on a Europe-wide basis as a good idea? One example from 
[normal]Germany
[normal] has already been quoted, but if you have any examples of schemes that you have discovered in other countries we would be very interested to hear
[normal] about them
[normal].
[normal]Tanith Dodge[bold]: It is not just an employer responsibility. I think it is the responsibility of education and the Government as well. We work with a number of charity partners. In particular, we work with 
[normal]t
[normal]he Prince’s Trust because 
[normal]it 
[normal]provide
[normal]s
[normal] incredible insight and value. 
[normal]It works
[normal] very closely with 
[normal]j
[normal]obcentre
[normal]s
[normal],
[normal] so when individuals come to our programme they have already been through a selection. We are looking at how we roll 
[normal]out 
[normal]our youth employment programme across 
[normal]Europe
[normal]. We are looking in 
[normal]France
[normal] at the moment. It is finding the charity partners equivalent to 
[normal]t
[normal]he Prince’s Trust in some of those countries that is proving a bit harder. We know 
[normal]that 
[normal]the model works in the 
[normal]UK
[normal]. We know 
[normal]that 
[normal]the model works with 
[normal]t
[normal]he Prince’s Trust. 
[normal]The question 
[normal]is how we can replicate that across 
[normal]Europe
[normal].
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] It is amazing. 
[normal]Some of us 
[normal]spent a day with 
[normal]t
[normal]he Prince’s Trust in 
[normal]Liverpool
[normal] last week, and it is very impressive.
[normal]Tanith Dodge[bold]: It is, yes.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] The commitment there is very high, but still only 221 per year go through the programme in Liverpool
[normal],
[normal] and there must be at least 221,000 people in a bad situation in 
[normal]Liverpool
[normal], so it is a very difficult one. Does anybody else want to come in? Lord Haskel, I blanked you out the last time, apparently.
[normal]Lord Haskel:[bold] My previous question really applied to 
[normal]Europe
[normal]. Could I just ask: do any of you use the EURES portal 
[normal]scheme 
[normal]set up by the European Commission to help young mobile jobseekers find jobs in other parts of 
[normal]Europe
[normal]?
[normal]Terry Morgan[bold]: The answer for me is no. Why do I not? I just feel very strongly at the moment 
[normal]that 
[normal]with youth unemployment in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] at the level
[normal] it is
[normal],
[normal] that is where my effort is going to be.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Exactly right. Lord Liverpool, you were going to ask a question about something in 
[normal]Europe
[normal], too, were you not?
[normal]Earl of [bold]Liverpool[bold]:[bold] Yes.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] S
[normal]orry, Lady Hooper.
[normal]Baroness Hooper:[bold] I do not think I have had all the answers to my question.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Sorry, carry on, yes. I am still trying to get in front of the clock.
[normal]Baroness Hooper:[bold] When I said, “Do you think all employers regard this as their responsibility?”
[normal],
[normal] there was a shaking of heads. I just wondered if there were any comments.
[normal]Terry Morgan[bold]: The answer is no. I think it is really important to identify exemplars
[normal],
[normal] and I suspect you will find 
[normal]that 
[normal]those exemplars are leading the market. The more publicity we can create around 
[normal]the fact 
[normal]that good healthy businesses do the training and development and employ young people
[normal], the more a model 
[normal]will 
[normal]be 
[normal]create
[normal]d
[normal] for others to follow. We need that.
[normal]Jez Langhorn[bold]: I would agree, 
[normal]and to build on that
[normal] I would say that 
[normal]compa
[normal]nies such as McDonald’s and M&amp;S, 
[normal]I am sure
[normal],
[normal] have a very large supply chain. Certainly something that we focused on is engaging the managing directors and the human resource directors of our big suppliers to set expectations around what they do as well. You can have a ripple effect down to much smaller companies and even down to farms across the 
[normal]UK
[normal] and 
[normal]Ireland
[normal] by doing that. I think that is important to do.
[normal]Q91 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]Earl of [bold]Liverpool[bold]:[bold] Good afternoon. We have heard so much about the apprentice schemes that you are operating
[normal],
[normal] and they sound absolutely excellent. Do you think there is anything else 
[normal]that 
[normal]employers could or should be expected to do to meet the skills and employability gaps that we hear so much about? Are there any other ideas that you might have?
[normal]Jez Langhorn[bold]: There are things that companies can do to share their skills.
[normal] For example, 
[normal]McDonald’s
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]in conjunction with Jobcentre Plus,
[normal] has 
[normal]for the last few weeks 
[normal]been 
[normal]running workshops that we have called “How to get hired”
[normal] for people who do not work for us
[normal].
[normal] Young unemployed people who have been unemployed for more than six months are coming into our restaurants to meet some of our apprentices
[normal],
[normal] local franchisees and managers to have interview skills training
[normal] and advice on 
[normal]how to build their CVs and how to articulate their skills properly. We have found those to be very successful for those young people
[normal],
[normal] and in fact many have 
[normal]then 
[normal]come on to do work experience and apply for jobs with us. There are things that big companies can do to leverage their size and scale for the good of young people
[normal],
[normal] and I think that is very important.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] We had a long discussion about 
[normal]j
[normal]obcentres and Jobcentre Plus in 
[normal]Liverpool
[normal]. Was it the j
[normal]obcentres 
[normal]that 
[normal]started that or was it you? How does the relationship go? Is it very collaborative or is somebody beating the stick?
[normal]Jez Langhorn[bold]: 
[normal]T
[normal]his was our idea
[normal],
[normal] but we do have a good relationship with Jobcentre Plus. One of the things that we have benefited from is a national account manager who represents McDonald’s 
[normal]at
[normal] Jobcentre Plus and 
[normal]who 
[normal]will champion the company. I think it is very important that you have that one point of contact. Again, across the whole of the 
[normal]UK
[normal] that is a challenge because that applies to 
[normal]England
[normal] only. You have to replicate that in the devolved nations, which for a UK-wide company can be quite burdensome and administratively heavy.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Yes, but of course you have the advantage of being a very large and well
[normal] 
[normal]known company. Joe Bloggs &amp; Sons down in Tottenham or some place might not be able to do something like that. It does strike me that the advantage of going at least for jobs in big companies in the beginning makes people much more employable
[normal] afterwards
[normal], I should think, because they will go through the programme.
[normal]Terry Morgan[bold]: Could I just say 
[normal]that 
[normal]we have an MOU with Jobcentre Plus and we give them a time envelope before we publicise a vacancy. We give them the opportunity first to match the vacancies that we have to people they are trying to help. It works sometimes
[normal],
[normal] and we do this across the whole of 
[normal]London
[normal]. That matching does work, but I have to say 
[normal]that 
[normal]one of the things that we are learning more as we go forward is that we also—back to Lord Liverpool’s point about what more we can do—have to do much more to reach out to local communities. How do we get to young people who perhaps through generations do not understand the job market any
[normal] 
[normal]more? They are not giving any advice at school or in the families, and trying to reach out to local communities is something
[normal] 
[normal]that 
[normal]again 
[normal]we are having to do.
[normal]Lord Clinton-Davis:[bold] 
[normal]I have interviewed some employees at McDonald’s privately,
[normal] and some of them—not all but some of them—expressed diffidence about what was happening to them. Some of them thought they were being exploited. Would you address that issue?
[normal]Jez Langhorn[bold]: Well, obviously, I would hope 
[normal]that that is not the case, 
[normal]and we have procedures in place should anyone feel that their contract is not being lived up to. What I can tell you is that through our surveys that we do with our staff independently
[normal],
[normal] the vast majority are very happy with their working hours. In fact, one of the main reasons they will join us is for the flexibility of the working hours
[normal], as well as 
[normal]the opportunity to train and get qualifications and build their CVs, as warranted by the number of people 
[normal]who 
[normal]apply to work for us each year. That 
[normal]is 
[normal]a central part of our company.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] I suspect that for some of these people who have joined
[normal] who have 
[normal]come from a background of people who have not worked, it is a big jolt to the system having to get up in the morning and be there and be clean and neat and all the rest of it.
[normal]Q92 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:[bold] If I may come back to the earlier question I posed, we were talking about going into the community and making links with the unemployed
[normal], 
[normal]particularly in families where there is endemic cyclical unemployment running right through. Is there any way in which you could suggest to us that there should be more opportunities provided for you to be able to do that? Secondly, do you have access directly into schools? Thirdly, you mentioned the problems you have with soft skills, let alone the academic ones. What do you think should be done to try to remedy some of those problems?
[normal]Jez Langhorn[bold]: I think 
[normal]that 
[normal]careers advice for young people 
[normal]is 
[normal]really important 
[normal]so that they are able 
[normal]to make the link between the qualifications that they are studying for and what jobs they can get. The job market is very dynamic. It changes all the time and it is important that young people are exposed to what the opportunities are. We are supporting a 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment-backed initiative called 
[normal]p
[normal]lotr, an online careers advice service for young people where many large employers have come together from around the country to provide information and guidance on what jobs are on offer
[normal] and 
[normal]the types of careers, but also what qualifications you need and to encourage and excite young people about the world of work. That is very important for companies to do.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Is this a website or a magazine?
[normal]Jez Langhorn[bold]: No, it is a website.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] It is 
[normal]p
[normal]lotr?
[normal]Jez Langhorn[bold]: Yes, P-
[normal]L
[normal]-
[normal]O
[normal]-
[normal]T
[normal]-
[normal]R, a name chosen by young people.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Who do not have qualifications in spelling
[normal]. Y
[normal]es, quite.
[normal]Jez Langhorn[bold]: It is a 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment-backed initiative but 
[normal]is employer-
[normal]led now. I would encourage you to have a look. I think it is a very good resource.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Thank you, we certainly will. If there are any other websites like that, can you let us know?
[normal]Jez Langhorn[bold]: Of course.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Because we do do our homework. Thank you.
[normal]Terry Morgan[bold]: I was just going to add that in our experience there is no shortage of voluntary organisations locally that want to try to find a relationship with large employers. For example, we have an organisation of 800. We have 150 ambassadors who are willing to go out 
[normal]either 
[normal]to local volunteer organisations or into local schools. The best people to do that are our apprentices and young people. They can relate to them. They cannot relate to us. That is really important.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] What about 
[normal]Marks &amp; Spencer
[normal]? You have a million applying for your jobs every year so you do not really have to go out, do you?
[normal]Tanith Dodge[bold]: No, we do a number of local community activities, 
[normal]such as going 
[normal]into schools to talk about job opportunities. There is still quite a misconception about the world of retail and what those jobs are, so we do quite a lot of work explaining what retail is about with schools and 
[normal]j
[normal]obcentres.
[normal]The community one is interesting and I do not have the answer, but we increasingly meet young people on our programme that we have taken on who are second and third generation who have never worked. They live in a community where when they go back at the end of the day it is frowned upon. How do we break that so 
[normal]that 
[normal]it is seen as more acceptable? One of the things that we do, and I do not claim that this is the answer but it helps, is 
[normal]that 
[normal]every young person who joins us is assigned a buddy, which is a member of staff who is there to talk to them about work
[normal] and 
[normal]how they feel when they go home at the end of the day, 
[normal]and to make 
[normal]sure they come back the next day. The young people say 
[normal]that 
[normal]it is like an umbilical cord to them. The other thing we do is set up communities within the store. If we have a number of young people on the programme, they can meet and talk to each other about their experience so that they do not feel ostracised or alienated when they leave and therefore
[normal] do not want
[normal] to come back. When we talk to some of these young people, their biggest barriers are the first few weeks when they go back to an environment where nobody works.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] So sad, is it not?  
[normal]Q93 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]Lord Cotter:[bold] First
[normal], a specific point. The European Union has called for a youth guarantee to offer young people without work and employment a training or study position within four months. Can I say 
[normal]that 
[normal]I have been very impressed with the way you are all addressing young people and helping in different sorts of ways? Do you see the youth guarantee as described here as a good idea from the point of view of business? Can I also add to that 
[normal]that 
[normal]as a general point we seem to be getting quite a clear picture that you have a lot of concerns about being led in a direction and not having perhaps enough input back into what is going on, mountains of bureaucracy and different concerns to do with apprenticeships, five different organisations and suchlike. We want to listen to young people and what they are saying, but we want to listen to employers as well. Do you feel 
[normal]that 
[normal]the youth guarantee is a good idea? Do you feel you have enough feedback into all these different systems that are going forward?
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Do you know about the youth guarantee?
[normal]Terry Morgan[bold]: I do know about the youth guarantee. My first question when I read the wording was: does that apply to the 
[normal]UK
[normal]? Who does it apply to? I think there is a condition attached to it about high levels of unemployment. There is no doubt in my mind 
[normal]that 
[normal]youngsters leaving school without having an opportunity to work will leave a scar on their life and we have a responsibility to try to deal with that.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] That is absolutely right, yes.
[normal]Tanith Dodge[bold]: I think the principle of it has to be right. It is how we make it work and thinking through how our organisation is part of that and how young people get the accreditation from that experience. It is the, “What next?”
[normal].
[normal] It is what happens beyond that.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Sure. I am told that it applies to inner London and other local authorities. Does anybody want to come in on the back of this? No, thank you.  
[normal]Q94 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]Lord Fearn:[bold] What is your view of the responses in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] such as the youth contract and more promotion of apprenticeships and work experience? We have heard about the work experience from 
[normal]Marks &amp; Spencer
[normal] already. As an MP, I went in as an experiment, I suppose, to McDonald’s to see what the young people were doing there. I failed my apprenticeship with McDonald’s because I burnt two rows of hamburgers for a start and then I burnt myself.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] That is one way of learning that you should not have been in that area.
[normal]Lord Fearn:[bold] I think they gave up the idea of employing MPs
[normal] or asking MPs to go in, but it 
[normal]was a good idea at the time. What other things should be done?
[normal]Jez Langhorn[bold]: Well, I am sorry you burnt yourself. I do think, though, 
[normal]that 
[normal]we have an opportunity in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] to do more of a marketing job about vocational qualifications because they are still seen as very much second rate to traditional academic qualifications. That is not right. I would like to see a time where vocational qualifications, which are right for those young people, are valued as much as traditional academic qualifications. I see that in my responsibility for countries outside the 
[normal]UK
[normal]. Certainly in 
[normal]Germany
[normal] that is very embedded
[normal]. They stream young people at 14 years-
[normal]old between academic and vocational training. One is not seen as better or worse
[normal];
[normal] it is just what is right for that young person. I think we do need to do more to celebrate vocational qualifications and young people achieving, so I would be a big supporter of that, which will help 
[normal]to 
[normal]change the culture around getting training while working. We have seen big movements over the last few years, but there is a long way to go on that.
[normal]Lord Fearn:[bold] Does that mean a new certificate
[normal],
[normal] and who gives that?
[normal]Jez Langhorn[bold]: I do not think it is so much 
[normal]about 
[normal]a new certificate. A lot of the qualifications are already there. It is a question of not just employers but 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment and the media as well having a role to play in how we talk about vocational qualifications. Working is a good thing and we should be encouraging it, not just 
[normal]because of 
[normal]people being able to support themselves but 
[normal]because of 
[normal]the social skills and being part of the social fabric of the 
[normal]UK
[normal]. We should be encouraging that and celebrating people going to work and gaining progression and qualifications and moving themselves along the ladder. I think we could do more of that.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] And avoiding mental illness and depression.
[normal]Jez Langhorn[bold]: Absolutely.
[normal]Lord Fearn:[bold] When I go into 
[normal]the food section at 
[normal]Marks &amp; Spencer
[normal], apart from where you have put those stupid machines to get people to go through quickly, there seem to be women on those machines but the men do all the work within the food department. Then if you go into the clothes, it is all women and very, very few men. Is that right?
[normal]Tanith Dodge[bold]: No, not at all. I am very happy to walk around a store with you and point out all the different roles.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] There you are, Lord Fearn.
[normal]Tanith Dodge[bold]: On your question about youth contracts, as a company we are very, very supportive of all the initiatives. We are fortunate because we have resources that can help us navigate through a number of different initiatives. The challenge if we want more companies and particularly SMEs to play their part is 
[normal]that 
[normal]we have to take out some of the confusion. There are lots of different initiatives and we need to make it simple and straightforward for organisations to play their part and do something. We welcome the review by Sir Jeremy Heywood to look at different initiatives and simplify 
[normal]this
[normal] because the risk is that there are too many initiatives. Smaller organisations or organisations that are not as minded to do something will say, “This is all too confusing. It is 
[normal]easier if we do not do anything
[normal]”
[normal].
[normal]Lord Fearn:[bold] Crossrail, is there anything there that can be done?
[normal]Terry Morgan[bold]: If you came into my plant, you would have the reverse of the comment that you have just made, which is that we do not have enough women. We are very keen to get more women and those decisions are made while youngsters are still at school.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]This goes 
[normal]back to careers advice.
[normal]Terry Morgan[bold]: It is about career advice and it is also 
[normal]about 
[normal]people’s views. I could not agree more with Jez. The whole point about creating as much value 
[normal]in 
[normal]a vocational career versus an academic career is fundamentally built up at school. If you listen to the rhetoric around expectations of youngsters leaving school, it is still all 
[normal]about
[normal] academic capability.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Yes, but is it not true 
[normal]that 
[normal]it is not necessarily school
[normal] but 
[normal]the whole chattering classes area? If 
[normal]you tell 
[normal]somebody 
[normal]that 
[normal]you are an engineer, they think you are a plumber and they do not necessarily think that you are building or designing bridges or great infrastructure projects like Crossrail.
[normal]Terry Morgan[bold]: I could not agree with you more. If you look around the rest of the world, of course, it is completely different.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Their engineers are the top people. The point is 
[normal]that 
[normal]accountants run our businesses here, whereas engineers do in other countries.
[normal]Terry Morgan[bold]: Well, I am an engineer.
[normal]Q95 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] What about job quality? Have terms, conditions and security for young people been eroded
[normal],
[normal] in the way other witnesses have claimed
[normal],
[normal] since the economic downturn started?
[normal]Terry Morgan[bold]: I personally do not think it is about economics. It is the reality of the world today. If we hark back to those old conversations 
[normal]about
[normal] guarantee of employment, this is not the market today. The market is about flexibility, mobility, moving around where those skills are needed in the economy. We hold on to those old prejudices. You just watch employers resist the idea of employing long term. When I was an apprentice a long time ago, the thought was 
[normal]that 
[normal]it was a job for life. That has gone. I had to change my perceptions. I think it is more important to invest in young people, give them a chance, and recognise that the employer might make a choice and the employee might make a choice that they want to go and do something else. I would prefer that rather than say
[normal]ing
[normal], “I am here for life”
[normal],
[normal] and bring
[normal]ing
[normal] out all the old attitudes and behaviours that just frustrate both the employer and the employee.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Right. What is your view on that?
[normal]Jez Langhorn[bold]: I would say that engaging young people particularly is very important. I said earlier that the average length of service is three and a half years for our young people. I would rather they enjoy their time with us
[normal]: that 
[normal]they learn, train, gain qualifications, do a good job for us, and grow their skills and confidence. Nine out of 10 of our managers come from those hourly paid ranks and they go on to have terrific careers with us. Some build their CV and their skills and their confidence and then use that to go on to other employers
[normal],
[normal] and that is fine as well.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Like Lord Fearn going on to be an MP when he got burnt.
[normal]Lord Clinton-Davis:[bold] Do you see any natural allies in what you are seeking to achieve
[normal],
[normal] or do you see people being opposed to certain aspects of what you are seeking to achieve?
[normal]Jez Langhorn[bold]: Well, informally there are networks and connections between large employers across the 
[normal]UK
[normal]. Tanith and I will see each other at different events where you have employers coming together to try to tackle this issue and share best practice. 
[normal]A
[normal]t McDonald’s we have hosted visits from 20 to 25 companies who are looking to set up apprenticeship schemes, for example, to share how you navigate your way through. The large responsible employers get it and pushing that further down the supply chain and encouraging suppliers to do that is something that we can all do.
[normal]Lord Clinton-Davis:[bold] Do you think the trade unions have a role as far as this is concerned?
[normal]Jez Langhorn[bold]: I think much of the work that trade unions do on skills and learning and education is very good, so I would applaud that.
[normal]Q96 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Lord Haskel:[bold] Ms Dodge spoke about all the initiatives that are around. We have heard evidence to suggest that employers are confused by the many different schemes and programmes for young people. We were told in evidence, for instance, that the CBI have identified 48 schemes from three different 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment departments: from BIS, from education, from welfare. Do you find this confusing
[normal],
[normal] or do you find having so many schemes to choose from helpful? Do you think some rationalisation is needed?
[normal]Terry Morgan[bold]: For me, the truth is 
[normal]that 
[normal]there are too many. I have to say 
[normal]that 
[normal]sometimes it works to your advantage because if you get rejected on one scheme you can find another route if you are determined to do so, but it is the wrong answer.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]Y
[normal]es, quite. 
[normal]That is very honest.
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]hat has been a terrific session. I know we have all been fired up by it and I just feel sorry for the 
[normal]Hansard
[normal] writers, but we will make sense of it. It is a great contribution to our report, which we hope will be published in April. Now, I am going to have the last question. If you were me, what question would you ask and what would be your answer? What have I left out, in other words? Tell us as it is, warts and all.
[normal]Tanith Dodge[bold]: One of the questions that might 
[normal]not 
[normal]have 
[normal]been mooted is the whole benefits agenda and how difficult it is for young people. If they have grown up in a family where everybody is on benefits and they are given the opportunity for work experience, they do not know if it is going to work out. They have to come off benefits and that is a deterrent for some young people 
[normal]as
[normal] they do not want to cut the umbilical cord. I know 
[normal]that 
[normal]universal credit will help in the future, but I think there will still be quite a lot of treacle there.
[normal]Terry Morgan[bold]: A completely different side of the question 
[normal]that 
[normal]I think should be asked is that you have the challenge of EU action to tackle youth unemployment, and the three of us have talked about local action. I am unclear how a European initiative will percolate down into actions that can make a difference. That for me is the big challenge.
[normal]Q97 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] I will answer that after I have asked Mr Langhorn if there is anything else that I should have asked that I have not asked.
[normal]Jez Langhorn[bold]: The only thing I would add is 
[normal]about 
[normal]how we can create some culture change around vocational qualifications. 
[normal]H
[normal]ow we create that culture change to have 
[normal]those qualifications 
[normal]recognised for the true skills that they deliver and 
[normal]that 
[normal]young people have
[normal] 
[normal]is a great challenge but also a great opportunity for the 
[normal]UK
[normal].
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] We will probably write to you all about the whole system of the EU, but we are a scrutiny committee. We have documents coming out of 
[normal]Brussels
[normal] all the time. Our responsibility is the internal market, the infrastructure and employment. There is a 
[normal]D
[normal]irective and there is this money that has been set aside for unemployment. We shall be doing our report both to send to the EU saying what our views are but also to our 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment Ministers who will be negotiating when the money is being doled out. They can either say, “No, that is a ridiculous situation”
[normal],
[normal] or, “Yes, we will fight for that”
[normal].
[normal] It is among the 28 
[normal]M
[normal]ember 
[normal]S
[normal]tates, but generally speaking this Committee does these reports and they are very well regarded in Brussels. They are published, of course, and for a lot of things we try to temper the whole issue. For example, we are fairly strong on some issues, 
[normal]but 
[normal]going back to culture, that just would not work here. We had a situation about women on boards, for example, and we were told, “Well, of course, on your supervisory boards”
[normal].
[normal] We do not have supervisory boards here. It is a learning process. We are learning, too, but a huge amount of money is being set aside by the 28 
[normal]Member St
[normal]ates to try to tackle this. Our one objective is that it is used properly and that we are not shoved off down certain alleyways to deal with things that are culturally or in any other way not pertinent to this country. It is not little 
[normal]England
[normal]; it is us acting as members of the European Union.
[normal]Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:[bold] It is worth observing, though, Chairman, that the money is only available to specific areas where the unemployment figures are very, very high indeed, which includes central 
[normal]London
[normal], by the way.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Yes. Thank you very much indeed. We have managed to keep within the time
