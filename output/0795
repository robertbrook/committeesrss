Written evidence [bold]from the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh[bold] (LTC 47)[bold]Introduction:[bold]Hospitals are seeing increasing number of medical admissi
[normal]ons.
[normal] 
[normal]The increase in numbers is
[normal] multifactorial with demographic changes accounting for less than half of this rise.
[normal]As hospitals decrease their bed n
[normal]umbers, they must reduce their length of stay (L
[normal]oS
[normal])
[normal] to compensate. This LoS needs to drop even furthe
[normal]r due to increasing admissions.
[normal] 
[normal]As a consequence of this
[normal],
[normal] elderly p
[normal]atients may
[normal] leave hospital with poorer functional capacity and fail in the community
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]This leads to
[normal] re-admission and the creation of a vicious cycle 
[normal]that may ultimately lead
[normal] to 24 hour care.
[normal]The key to assessm
[normal]ent of the older person is the C
[normal]omprehensive Geriatric 
[normal]A
[normal]ssessment (CGA) carried ou
[normal]t by the multidisciplinary team including the consultant.
[normal] 
[normal]Geriatricians a
[normal]re now one of the largest medical 
[normal]specialities in the UK and they
[normal] provide significant input into acute GIM on call. 
[normal]Over the last few years there has 
[normal]been a shift of resources from secondary
[normal] care to primary care.
[normal] 
[normal]A greater emphasis has been placed on preventative care in the community.
[normal] 
[normal]However, the
[normal]re are challenges set in the most at risk population in primary care.
[normal] 
[normal]These 
[normal]are

[normal]Palliative and End of life care
[normal]General practitioners have been set up to provide preventative care, with the creation of Q
[normal]uality 
[normal]O
[normal]utcome 
[normal]F
[normal]ramework
[normal]s
[normal] (
[normal]QoFs
[normal])
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]However, th
[normal]e evidence to say that QoFs have a significant effect in improving care
[normal] is limited (Cochrane data base Sept 2011).
[normal] 
[normal]Good primary care also involves the rational use of hospital based resources which is achieved through the GP gate keeping role. Unfortunately, the new GP contract and the loss of normal out of hours care means that for
[normal] a significant part of the week
[normal] an elderly person will not be looked after by their primary health care team.
[normal]Intermediate care (IC) was first described in the literature in 1985, 
[normal]and 
[normal]over the years many different models of intermediate care have been
[normal] proposed/
[normal]developed.
[normal] 
[normal]The evidence for supporting intermediate care is variable and the studies are small, with different outcomes being looked at and with diff
[normal]ering methodologies being used.
[normal] 
[normal]Therefore this makes 
[normal]generalisable
[normal] conclusions problematic in suggesting that intermediate care can be used to stem hospital admissions.
[normal]There is
[normal],
[normal] however
[normal],
[normal] clearly an opportunity to shift
[normal] 
[normal]focus more into the community.
[normal] 
[normal]Hospital clinics in all specialties are full of patients on long term follow up for ‘review and monitoring’.
[normal] 
[normal]This can only be successful if there are clear pathways for patients and properly supportive networks across the care sectors.
