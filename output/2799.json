"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nProfessor Greg Marsden and Jeremy Shires\n,\n Institute for Transport Studies, University of Leeds (WRT 010)\nKey Points:BackgroundProfessor Marsden is the Director of the Institute for Transport Studies at the University of Leeds. He is also the Project Director for the Disruption project (\nwww.disruptionproject.net\n), a £1.2m Research Council study examining what can be learnt from disruptive events of various sorts. \n \nJeremy Shires is a Senior Research Fellow at the Institute for Transport Studies at University of Leeds and had responsibility for designing and implementing all surveys undertaken as part of the Disruption project.\n \nThe Disruption project conducted a large scale on-line survey (\n2,417\n) in six of the worst affected areas of the UK (Hampshire, Kent, Surrey, Norfolk, South Wales and West Yorkshire) during the severe bout of winter weather in January 2013. The submission draws on the findings from this survey and broader insights from the Disruption project which has also explored flooding and infrastructure closure. The submission however represents\n the views of the authors \nrather than the Disruption project team or the Institute for Transport Studies.\nEvidenceBehavioural Response and Impacts&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTable 1: Behavioural Responses – By Main Activity AffectedActivityDelayed StartDelayed FinishPostponedCancelNew DestinationConducted RemotelyaOthernCommute \n49%\n32%\n8%\n41%\n2%\n12%\n5%\n974\nBiz Travel\n21%\n17%\n41%\n41%\n2%\n5%\n4%\n126\nReturn Home\n26%\n46%\n16%\n16%\n4%\n0%\n5%\n74\nHealth\n7%\n7%\n48%\n37%\n0%\n0%\n7%\n85\nSchool/ Child Care\n14%\n5%\n10%\n80%\n0%\n3%\n2%\n278\nOther Care\n22%\n23%\n34%\n25%\n1%\n8%\n9%\n77\nShopping\n16%\n8%\n46%\n34%\n5%\n5%\n2%\n250\nSport\n3%\n1%\n24%\n75%\n1%\n0%\n0%\n113\nLeisure\n5%\n3%\n28%\n59%\n2%\n1%\n7%\n151\nFamily/ Friends\n9%\n4%\n46%\n45%\n2%\n2%\n1%\n194\nOther\n12%\n8%\n15%\n24%\n1%\n1%\n11%\n95\nNote: Rows do not add up to 100% as respondents could select more than one response. \na:  Conducted at home via internet, telephone etc…\n&#xa0;\nCommunicating with Travellers&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTable 2: Sources of Official Advice During the DisruptionSource of Official Advice&#xa0;Source of Official Advise&#xa0;Central Government\n14%\nNational Organisations (AA, the Met Office etc…)\n56%\nLocal Government\n20%\nOther\n12%\nEmergency Services\n17%\nNone\n24%\nNote: Responses do not add up to 100% as respondents could select more than one response.\nTable 3: Sources of Information During the DisruptionSource:&#xa0;Source:&#xa0;TV\n81%\nFacebook\n8%\nRadio\n54%\nOther Social Media\n1%\nNewspapers\n22%\nFamily &amp; Friends\n19%\nInternet\n48%\nOther\n2%\nTwitter\n4%\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nInstitutional Issues&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWalking and Cycling&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n9th October 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n Contributions to international experience are from research colleagues based in Denmark and Holland.\n"
