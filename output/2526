[normal]Written evidence submitted by the [bold]Chartered Institute of Housing[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction[bold] and summary[bold]1.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Chartered Institute of Housing (CIH) is the independent voice for housing and the home of professional standards. Our goal is simple – to provide housing professionals with the advice, support and knowledge they need to be brilliant. CIH is a registere
[normal]d charity and not-for-profit organisation. This means that the money we make is put back into the organisation and funds the activities we carry out to support the housing sector. We have a diverse and growing membership of more than 22,000 people who work
[normal] in both the public and private sectors, in 20 countries on five continents across the world. Further information is available at: 
[normal]www.cih.org
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We welcome 
[normal]the Select Committee’s inquiry 
[normal]into the effects of recent reforms to welfare support with housing costs
[normal]. There have been many reforms, and the scale and speed of their implementation has heightened their impact on households, landlords, and a range of statutory and voluntary agencies. T
[normal]o date, the arguments for and against these reforms have focused largely on the moral case and projected effects. As time passes it is becoming possible to assess the actual effects, and it is essential that these are understood and used to inform both deb
[normal]ate and future welfare policy.

[normal]Detailed response[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]CIH worked with Haringey 
[normal]Council 
[normal]to assess the early responses to, and impacts of, the benefit cap. The effects on households, council services and local voluntary services were identified. The full report can be provided to the Committee in week commencing 14 October. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The policy is 
[normal]some way from meeting its objectives, and it will face significant barriers to doing so.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Households affected by the cap are facing significant challenges:
[normal].
[normal]1.8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A number of unintended consequences are becoming apparent:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.9
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Local decision makers can learn from Haringey’s experience:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.10
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is 
[normal]still 
[normal]early to draw 
[normal]firm 
[normal]conclusions about the overall consequences 
[normal]of the 
[normal]social sector size criteria 
[normal]for tenants and landlords 
[normal]but, six months in, 
[normal]the early impacts are clear
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.11
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Many
[normal] tenants who now face a benefit shortfall are struggling to make ends meet. If 
[normal]recently published surveys were 
[normal]replicated 
[normal]UK-wide,
[normal] over 330,000 tenants would be struggling to pay their rent or facing an uncertain future
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.12
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]CIH rejects 
[normal]the assertion that affected tenants 
[normal]can choose to stay and pay the shortfall
[normal],
[normal] or move to a home that more closely matches needs
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]as 
[normal]happens in the PRS.
[normal] 
[normal]S
[normal]ocial tenants are not as free to move as private tenants
[normal],
[normal] for a number of reasons:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.13
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The DWP’s equality impact assessment estimated around two-thirds of those affected by the reform are disabled
[normal]. As 
[normal]part of our evidence gathering for this inquiry as to the impact of this reform CIH has interrogated the 2010/11 Family Resources Survey
[normal] 
[normal](FRS). Using this data we estimate
[normal]d
[normal] the number
[normal] of
[normal] 
[normal]affected 
[normal]households who did not have a spare room
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]how many 
[normal]of t
[normal]he remainder might reasonably be expected to move.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.14
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]At the time of writing our final figures are yet available, however, we do have some provisional estimates for the committee. The final results will be made available before it completes its inquiry. Our 
[normal]provisional estimates at this stage as follows
[normal]:
[normal]Of the remaining 
[normal]59
[normal]0,000:
[normal]We would not consider it reasonable to expect these households to move. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.15
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Outside of our findings there may be other very good reasons why it unreasonable to expect the tenant to move in each particular case. The Government’s response is that special needs can be met through DHPs. The total Government allocation 
[normal]for
[normal] this part of
[normal] the reform in 
[normal]2013/14 is £30 million
[normal]. We estimate
[normal] this
[normal] would cover only around 10% of households where the householder or their partner is disabled. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.16
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is unlikely that t
[normal]enants with a disability who
[normal] do
[normal] require a smaller property could find a suitable
[normal] P
[normal]RS
[normal] replacement 
[normal](
[normal]purpose built or specifically adapted to their needs
[normal]). In particular, 
[normal]if they are aged under 
[normal]35 but do not qualify for a P
[normal]ersonal 
[normal]I
[normal]ndepe
[normal]ndence P
[normal]ayment they will be expected to take a room in a shared house – which may be highly unsuitable
[normal] -
[normal] or face a 
[normal]large benefit 
[normal]shortfall. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.17
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Tenants 
[normal]who
[normal] do decide to move may 
[normal]re-
[normal]qualify for full benefit in a few years (e.g. because 
[normal]older
[normal] 
[normal]children 
[normal]are
[normal] no longer expected to share) only to find that it could be years before they 
[normal]can access
[normal] a new social tenancy
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.18
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I
[normal]n certain areas of the country the 
[normal]size criteria 
[normal]policy actually discourages the best use of stock and is wasteful of public resources. 
[normal]It has driven down 
[normal]demand for larger property, which 
[normal]result
[normal]s
[normal] in the landlord having large numbers of ‘difficult to let
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal]homes
[normal]. For the landlords affected
[normal], allowing under-occupation has long been 
[normal]a core component of their lettings strategy. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.19
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The change from
[normal] HB to universal credit is a bigger leap for claimants and landlords than it might first appear
[normal]. This includes
[normal] 
[normal]about 10-20% of 
[normal]LHA claimants who currently receive their HB direct
[normal] as well as most social tenants. 
[normal]CIH does not oppose tenant payment of benefit
[normal]s and believe the objective is
[normal] achievable in the medium term - o
[normal]ur concern has always been how the changeover can be managed whilst minimising the risks.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.20
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Landlord payment of housing costs has been the normal practice for 
[normal]decades
[normal]. Therefore the change requ
[normal]ired is not just behavioural
[normal] and it
[normal] cannot be achieved overnight without incurring considerable risks for landlords and tenants.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.21
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The lessons from the
[normal] six direct payment demonstration projects
[normal] around rent collection, tenant behaviour and preferences, payment methods and communication between landlord and tenant are usef
[normal]ul. They must be used to inform the final design of the direct payment mechanism. Initial findings have been published by DWP and more will be available in November – we encourage the committee to refer to these findings whilst conducting this inquiry. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.22
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Availability and development of facilities to enable tenants to manage payment of rent to landlords has been a key issue as we 
[normal]approach
[normal] 
[normal]implementation of direct payments. Options were quickly ident
[normal]ified: basic bank accounts, credit unions, payment cards
[normal]. H
[normal]owever, 
[normal]t
[normal]here are still significant barriers to use of all these options by benefit recipients, 
[normal]and these need to be properly understood and addressed where possible before direct payment can become a reali
[normal]ty. Challenges include:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.23
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]One of the key aims of u
[normal]niversal
[normal] credit is to simplify the benefits system. 
[normal]I
[normal]t is increasingly clear that u
[normal]niversal credit is
[normal] actually
[normal] the most complex benefit that has yet been devised. 
[normal]Whilst it simplifies the
[normal] structure of welfare payments
[normal], 
[normal]the rules that establish entitlement to an aw
[normal]ard of benefit
[normal] have become more complex
[normal]. Reforms such as the benefit cap and the social sector size criteria add to complexity – making the whole process much more challenging than it would have been had they not taken place. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.24
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The role played by 
[normal]good administration 
[normal]in
[normal] successful implementation of any new benefit 
[normal]has been
[normal] underestimated. This 
[normal]is
[normal] reflected in the view that the whole administration could be easily automated (something that the recent experience of tax credits disproved). Structural s
[normal]implification (removing duplication across several different benefits and combining payments) does not simplify administration
[normal]. I
[normal]f anything it makes 
[normal]administration
[normal] more complex as separate and specialised different decision making processes have to be inte
[normal]grated .
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.25
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Much attention has been given to development of the IT system for Universal credit, but 
[normal]efficient benefits administration is rarely about the quality of the IT 
[normal](we do not deny
[normal] 
[normal]it helps
[normal]).
[normal] 
[normal]Most important
[normal] is the processes for checking and 
[normal]verifying that the accuracy of the information on which entitlement is based. This is still very much a human skill. A failure to accept this will result in
[normal] mistakes and
[normal] fraud leaking into the system.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.26
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]housing sector
[normal]’
[normal]s concerns about its design and operation have been repeatedly 
[normal]played down 
[normal]by government, but the 
[normal]recent 
[normal]establishment of the Support and Exceptions Working Group (SEWG) Landlords sub-group
[normal] is positive
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]It has met twice in the last couple of months and has
[normal] a promising programme of work that should help ensure that landlords concerns about universal credit payment are better taken account of when the programme is fully rolled out.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.27
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As t
[normal]he DWP’s initial impact assessment (July 
[normal]2010) 
[normal]showed, all LHA claimants face a loss from the benefit reforms. 
[normal]CIH estimated that the effect of the reforms was that around 800,000 properties fewer properties nationally would now be fully covered by the LHA
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.28
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Government intends that the bottom 30
[normal]% of private rental market is available to LHA claimants. The decision to freeze LHA rates and increase only by CPI will shor
[normal]t
[normal]ly mean that less than 30% of the market is available. Government’s proposal to help some areas offset this is not enough, and the
[normal] intervention will become increasingly unwieldy over time. More information is available in our submission to the recent government consultation
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.29
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Nationally available research into the actual impact of the reforms is still hard to come by. 
[normal]In May 2013
[normal],
[normal] e
[normal]arly survey findings 
[normal]from
[normal] 
[normal]a
[normal] study commissioned by the DWP 
[normal]were
[normal] published. The research looked at the attitudes of claimants and landlords in 19 areas across Great Britain. 
[normal]We recommend that the Select Committee considers the findings of this study, but we 
[normal]stress that the research is ongoing and that published findings at this stage are still limited to landlords and tenants attitudes about what might happen. 
[normal]The full impact of the measures is not expected to become evident until the start of this year when 
[normal]protection ran out.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.30
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The change from council tax benefit (CTB) to council tax reductions (CTR) has been implemented remarkably smoothly
[normal]. This 
[normal]is a testament to the efficiency of local benefit services. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.31
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Given the difficulties that the 
[normal]g
[normal]overnment is having surrounding the 
[normal]administration
[normal] 
[normal]of universal credit
[normal],
[normal] it 
[normal]would be wise to reconsider the decision not
[normal] to make use of the skills within local benefits services as part of the solution. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.32
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]During the run up t
[normal]o the start date on the 1 April 2013 local authorities 
[normal]had 
[normal]to consult about their proposals for a local scheme before the legislative underpinning had been put in place. As a result around 13% of local authorities in England effectively have a local scheme
[normal] where the rules of entitlement are exactly the same as the previous CTB scheme. We suspect that those that have taken this approach 
[normal]felt
[normal] it would be better to take the financial hit for the first year rather than suffer the risk of legal challenges.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.33
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Rather than freeing local authorities from central Government CTR has resulted in a four fold increase in Government regulation across Great Britain. The
[normal] old
[normal] CTB regulations amounted to just over 200 pages.
[normal] New
[normal] CTR regulations for England, Scotland and Wal
[normal]es amount to just under 800 pages.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Conclusions[bold]1.34
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As time passes, the scale and nature of the impact of recent reforms to support with housing costs are becoming more apparent. 
[normal]It is important that proper account is taken of these impacts, and that policy ch
[normal]anges to offset the most serious are considered so that the UK’s ability to meet housing needs does not face further barriers.
[normal]1.35
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Universal credit is still on the horizon but lessons from the demonstration projects and the reforms already implemented are valu
[normal]able and must be used in forthcoming work to get this beleaguered policy to achieve its valuable original aims.  
[normal]1.36
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We welcome the role of the Work and Pensions Committee in highlighting evidence and suggesting ways forward, and we look forward to receiving 
[normal]your final report.

[normal] The Family Resources Survey is a
[normal] 1% sample of all UK households (around 25,000 cases) containing very detailed information about each household member. The FRS is used by the DWP to conduct its own impact assessment of each of the welfare reform measures and is also used for policy devel
[normal]opment by the Treasury to assess the savings/costs of any new policy.
[normal] One bedroom was allocated for each of the following: the tenant and their partner, each other adult or other couple in the household aged 16 or over; each child.  
[normal] Defined as being in receipt of disability living allowance
[normal] Defined as being in receipt incapacity benefit, severe disablement allowance or employment or support allowance
[normal] Of the £160 million allocated for 2013/14 the breakdown is as follows. £20 million, the original baseline for all cases to take account of individual circumstances (regardless of tenure); £40 million to take account of the LHA reforms; £65 million to take
[normal] account of the cap – falling to £35 million in 2014/15; £30 million for the social sector size criteria; and £5 million for the 21 areas most sparsely populated rural areas. DWP circulars  S1/2013 and A17/2013.
