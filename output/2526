defaultThe Chartered Institute of Housing (CIH) is the independent voice for housing and the home of professional standards. Our goal is simple – to provide housing professionals with the advice, support and knowledge they need to be brilliant. CIH is a registere
defaultd charity and not-for-profit organisation. This means that the money we make is put back into the organisation and funds the activities we carry out to support the housing sector. We have a diverse and growing membership of more than 22,000 people who work
default in both the public and private sectors, in 20 countries on five continents across the world. Further information is available at: 
defaultwww.cih.org

defaultWe welcome 
defaultthe Select Committee’s inquiry 
defaultinto the effects of recent reforms to welfare support with housing costs
default. There have been many reforms, and the scale and speed of their implementation has heightened their impact on households, landlords, and a range of statutory and voluntary agencies. T
defaulto date, the arguments for and against these reforms have focused largely on the moral case and projected effects. As time passes it is becoming possible to assess the actual effects, and it is essential that these are understood and used to inform both deb
defaultate and future welfare policy.

defaultCIH worked with Haringey 
defaultCouncil 
defaultto assess the early responses to, and impacts of, the benefit cap. The effects on households, council services and local voluntary services were identified. The full report can be provided to the Committee in week commencing 14 October. 
default&#xa0;
default1.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe policy is 
defaultsome way from meeting its objectives, and it will face significant barriers to doing so.
default&#xa0;
default1.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHouseholds affected by the cap are facing significant challenges:

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA number of unintended consequences are becoming apparent:
default&#xa0;
default1.9
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLocal decision makers can learn from Haringey’s experience:
default&#xa0;
default1.10
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is 
defaultstill 
defaultearly to draw 
defaultfirm 
defaultconclusions about the overall consequences 
defaultof the 
defaultsocial sector size criteria 
defaultfor tenants and landlords 
defaultbut, six months in, 
defaultthe early impacts are clear
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.11
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMany
default tenants who now face a benefit shortfall are struggling to make ends meet. If 
defaultrecently published surveys were 
defaultreplicated 
defaultUK-wide,
default over 330,000 tenants would be struggling to pay their rent or facing an uncertain future
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.12
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCIH rejects 
defaultthe assertion that affected tenants 
defaultcan choose to stay and pay the shortfall
default,
default or move to a home that more closely matches needs
default,
default 
defaultas 
defaulthappens in the PRS.
default 
defaultS
defaultocial tenants are not as free to move as private tenants
default,
default for a number of reasons:
default&#xa0;
default1.13
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe DWP’s equality impact assessment estimated around two-thirds of those affected by the reform are disabled
default. As 
defaultpart of our evidence gathering for this inquiry as to the impact of this reform CIH has interrogated the 2010/11 Family Resources Survey
default 
default(FRS). Using this data we estimate
defaultd
default the number
default of
default 
defaultaffected 
defaulthouseholds who did not have a spare room
default,
default and 
defaulthow many 
defaultof t
defaulthe remainder might reasonably be expected to move.
default&#xa0;
default1.14
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAt the time of writing our final figures are yet available, however, we do have some provisional estimates for the committee. The final results will be made available before it completes its inquiry. Our 
defaultprovisional estimates at this stage as follows
default:
defaultOf the remaining 
default59
default0,000:
defaultWe would not consider it reasonable to expect these households to move. 
default&#xa0;
default1.15
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOutside of our findings there may be other very good reasons why it unreasonable to expect the tenant to move in each particular case. The Government’s response is that special needs can be met through DHPs. The total Government allocation 
defaultfor
default this part of
default the reform in 
default2013/14 is £30 million
default. We estimate
default this
default would cover only around 10% of households where the householder or their partner is disabled. 
default&#xa0;
default1.16
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is unlikely that t
defaultenants with a disability who
default do
default require a smaller property could find a suitable
default P
defaultRS
default replacement 
default(
defaultpurpose built or specifically adapted to their needs
default). In particular, 
defaultif they are aged under 
default35 but do not qualify for a P
defaultersonal 
defaultI
defaultndepe
defaultndence P
defaultayment they will be expected to take a room in a shared house – which may be highly unsuitable
default -
default or face a 
defaultlarge benefit 
defaultshortfall. 
default&#xa0;
default1.17
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTenants 
defaultwho
default do decide to move may 
defaultre-
defaultqualify for full benefit in a few years (e.g. because 
defaultolder
default 
defaultchildren 
defaultare
default no longer expected to share) only to find that it could be years before they 
defaultcan access
default a new social tenancy
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.18
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultI
defaultn certain areas of the country the 
defaultsize criteria 
defaultpolicy actually discourages the best use of stock and is wasteful of public resources. 
defaultIt has driven down 
defaultdemand for larger property, which 
defaultresult
defaults
default in the landlord having large numbers of ‘difficult to let
default’
default 
defaulthomes
default. For the landlords affected
default, allowing under-occupation has long been 
defaulta core component of their lettings strategy. 
default&#xa0;
default1.19
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe change from
default HB to universal credit is a bigger leap for claimants and landlords than it might first appear
default. This includes
default 
defaultabout 10-20% of 
defaultLHA claimants who currently receive their HB direct
default as well as most social tenants. 
defaultCIH does not oppose tenant payment of benefit
defaults and believe the objective is
default achievable in the medium term - o
defaultur concern has always been how the changeover can be managed whilst minimising the risks.
default&#xa0;
default1.20
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLandlord payment of housing costs has been the normal practice for 
defaultdecades
default. Therefore the change requ
defaultired is not just behavioural
default and it
default cannot be achieved overnight without incurring considerable risks for landlords and tenants.
default&#xa0;
default1.21
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe lessons from the
default six direct payment demonstration projects
default around rent collection, tenant behaviour and preferences, payment methods and communication between landlord and tenant are usef
defaultul. They must be used to inform the final design of the direct payment mechanism. Initial findings have been published by DWP and more will be available in November – we encourage the committee to refer to these findings whilst conducting this inquiry. 
default&#xa0;
default1.22
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAvailability and development of facilities to enable tenants to manage payment of rent to landlords has been a key issue as we 
defaultapproach
default 
defaultimplementation of direct payments. Options were quickly ident
defaultified: basic bank accounts, credit unions, payment cards
default. H
defaultowever, 
defaultt
defaulthere are still significant barriers to use of all these options by benefit recipients, 
defaultand these need to be properly understood and addressed where possible before direct payment can become a reali
defaultty. Challenges include:
default&#xa0;
default1.23
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOne of the key aims of u
defaultniversal
default credit is to simplify the benefits system. 
defaultI
defaultt is increasingly clear that u
defaultniversal credit is
default actually
default the most complex benefit that has yet been devised. 
defaultWhilst it simplifies the
default structure of welfare payments
default, 
defaultthe rules that establish entitlement to an aw
defaultard of benefit
default have become more complex
default. Reforms such as the benefit cap and the social sector size criteria add to complexity – making the whole process much more challenging than it would have been had they not taken place. 
default&#xa0;
default1.24
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe role played by 
defaultgood administration 
defaultin
default successful implementation of any new benefit 
defaulthas been
default underestimated. This 
defaultis
default reflected in the view that the whole administration could be easily automated (something that the recent experience of tax credits disproved). Structural s
defaultimplification (removing duplication across several different benefits and combining payments) does not simplify administration
default. I
defaultf anything it makes 
defaultadministration
default more complex as separate and specialised different decision making processes have to be inte
defaultgrated .
default&#xa0;
default1.25
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMuch attention has been given to development of the IT system for Universal credit, but 
defaultefficient benefits administration is rarely about the quality of the IT 
default(we do not deny
default 
defaultit helps
default).
default 
defaultMost important
default is the processes for checking and 
defaultverifying that the accuracy of the information on which entitlement is based. This is still very much a human skill. A failure to accept this will result in
default mistakes and
default fraud leaking into the system.
default&#xa0;
default1.26
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaulthousing sector
default’
defaults concerns about its design and operation have been repeatedly 
defaultplayed down 
defaultby government, but the 
defaultrecent 
defaultestablishment of the Support and Exceptions Working Group (SEWG) Landlords sub-group
default is positive
default.
default 
defaultIt has met twice in the last couple of months and has
default a promising programme of work that should help ensure that landlords concerns about universal credit payment are better taken account of when the programme is fully rolled out.
default&#xa0;
default1.27
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs t
defaulthe DWP’s initial impact assessment (July 
default2010) 
defaultshowed, all LHA claimants face a loss from the benefit reforms. 
defaultCIH estimated that the effect of the reforms was that around 800,000 properties fewer properties nationally would now be fully covered by the LHA
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.28
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGovernment intends that the bottom 30
default% of private rental market is available to LHA claimants. The decision to freeze LHA rates and increase only by CPI will shor
defaultt
defaultly mean that less than 30% of the market is available. Government’s proposal to help some areas offset this is not enough, and the
default intervention will become increasingly unwieldy over time. More information is available in our submission to the recent government consultation
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.29
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNationally available research into the actual impact of the reforms is still hard to come by. 
defaultIn May 2013
default,
default e
defaultarly survey findings 
defaultfrom
default 
defaulta
default study commissioned by the DWP 
defaultwere
default published. The research looked at the attitudes of claimants and landlords in 19 areas across Great Britain. 
defaultWe recommend that the Select Committee considers the findings of this study, but we 
defaultstress that the research is ongoing and that published findings at this stage are still limited to landlords and tenants attitudes about what might happen. 
defaultThe full impact of the measures is not expected to become evident until the start of this year when 
defaultprotection ran out.
default&#xa0;
default1.30
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe change from council tax benefit (CTB) to council tax reductions (CTR) has been implemented remarkably smoothly
default. This 
defaultis a testament to the efficiency of local benefit services. 
default&#xa0;
default1.31
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGiven the difficulties that the 
defaultg
defaultovernment is having surrounding the 
defaultadministration
default 
defaultof universal credit
default,
default it 
defaultwould be wise to reconsider the decision not
default to make use of the skills within local benefits services as part of the solution. 
default&#xa0;
default1.32
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDuring the run up t
defaulto the start date on the 1 April 2013 local authorities 
defaulthad 
defaultto consult about their proposals for a local scheme before the legislative underpinning had been put in place. As a result around 13% of local authorities in England effectively have a local scheme
default where the rules of entitlement are exactly the same as the previous CTB scheme. We suspect that those that have taken this approach 
defaultfelt
default it would be better to take the financial hit for the first year rather than suffer the risk of legal challenges.
default&#xa0;
default1.33
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRather than freeing local authorities from central Government CTR has resulted in a four fold increase in Government regulation across Great Britain. The
default old
default CTB regulations amounted to just over 200 pages.
default New
default CTR regulations for England, Scotland and Wal
defaultes amount to just under 800 pages.
default&#xa0;
defaultConclusionsdefault1.34
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs time passes, the scale and nature of the impact of recent reforms to support with housing costs are becoming more apparent. 
defaultIt is important that proper account is taken of these impacts, and that policy ch
defaultanges to offset the most serious are considered so that the UK’s ability to meet housing needs does not face further barriers.
default1.35
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUniversal credit is still on the horizon but lessons from the demonstration projects and the reforms already implemented are valu
defaultable and must be used in forthcoming work to get this beleaguered policy to achieve its valuable original aims.  
default1.36
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe welcome the role of the Work and Pensions Committee in highlighting evidence and suggesting ways forward, and we look forward to receiving 
defaultyour final report.
