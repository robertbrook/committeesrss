"&#xa0;\nSubmission from GM-Free Cymru&#xa0;\nQuote: \n&#xa0;\n\"\nThe new UK Strategy for Agricultural Technologies seeks to exploit opportunities to \ndevelop and adopt new and existing technologies, products and services to increase productivity. GM technology is one option. Supporters argue that it has the potential to increase crop yields and contribute to a more resilient agricultural system. Others \nfear the unknown long-term environmental implications of this technology.\n\"\n&#xa0;\nThe above statement could have been made just the other day by Owen Paterson (1). \n&#xa0;\nIt could also have been made more than a decade ago by the Government of the day, and it probably\n was. \n&#xa0;\nIt indicates the poverty of DEFRA thinking and a naive acceptance of the assurances of the GM industry and GM research community that wonder crops are just around the corner, that that they will increase yields and productivity and enhance UK food s\novereignty and food security. \n&#xa0;\nWell, those sentiments come from fantasy land; the wonder crops never do seem to actually come to fruition, and the evidence now shows that GM crops do not increase yields or reduce pesticide use, and do not improve farm prod\nuctivity or profitability (2). \n&#xa0;\nMore to the point, they are associated with both environmental AND health damage (the latter is ignored in the statement above.) Furthermore, an increasing dependence upon GM soy in the UK animal feed industry has REDUCED th\ne UK's food security. \n&#xa0;\nIt has greatly increased UK vulnerability to global price shocks and \nunforseen\n events -- especially important now that evidence for health and environmental harm associated with these crops is pouring into the public domain. \n&#xa0;\nFor som\ne years we have warned that the UK is sleep-walking into an agricultural / food supply disaster. \n&#xa0;\nThe term \"perfect storm\" comes to mind.........\n&#xa0;\nPlease take on board the following points:\n&#xa0;\n1. \n&#xa0;\nWe have been intrigued to see recent press coverage of commen\nts from the Secretary of State for the Environment relating to GM crops and foods. It is reported that he believes that GM crops have a considerable role to play in the alleviation of global food shortages in the future. It is fairly clear that he has succ\numbed to the deluge of recent pro-GM propaganda from the biotechnology multinationals and trade organizations. But we also fear that he has been given partisan, unscientific and out-dated information by his advisors, and we ask the Committee urgently to re\nconsider its position on this. \n&#xa0;\nHow many times has \nMr\n Paterson held discussions with NGOs and independent scientists who actually have concerns about GMOs and who cite firm science in support of their views? \n&#xa0;\nWe suspect that the answer is \"Not once.\"\n&#xa0;\n2. \n&#xa0;\nGM lobbyists have been promising the miracles of GM technology for over 2 decades. These people are in possession of a solution in search of a problem. To date they have seriously failed to deliver on all of their promises relating to enhanced farm incomes\n, improved nutrition, increased yields, better pest control etc. \n&#xa0;\nBillions of \neuros\n have been invested across Europe, and millions of pounds in the UK, and still this technology is rejected by \nconsumers, farmers, and policy makers all over the world. That \nis because there are NO consumer benefits: food made from GM crops is not cheaper, healthier, tastier or more attractive to look at, and neither does it extend shelf life (2). So why should anybody bother with it? Here is a question for the Committee: \n&#xa0;\n\"Ha\ns anybody ever asked for GM food in preference to non-GM food?\" \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe are appalled by the ongoing arrogance of politicians in this matter, who persist in saying: \"You have to have GMOs whether you want them or not, because we say they are good for you.\" \n&#xa0;\nTh\ne only people they are good for are the shareholders of Monsanto and the other biotechnology corporations.\n&#xa0;\n3. \n&#xa0;\nIt is true that the era of cheap food is over - on account of rising production and fuel costs, and the diversion of huge quantities of food cro\nps into the \nbiofuels\n market. However, this also shows that we should be moving away from oil and chemical based food production such as GM and embracing sustainable methods like organic and low- input farming - based on renewable energy use and carbon redu\nction strategies. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4. \n&#xa0;\nAlso, we part company with the Committee in its emphasis on \"productivity\" -- \n&#xa0;\nthe American mid-western farming model, in which productivity is everything, has taken the \"culture\" out of \n&#xa0;\n\"agriculture\" -- it is about as far from tr\naditional agriculture as it is possible to get, with major cost items \nexternalised\n and conveniently forgotten about, no thought about long-term sustainability, and no awareness of what \"stewardship\" actually means. \n&#xa0;\nFurthermore, sovereignty has been sacrif\nice and replaced with a sort of corporate feudalism controlled by Monsanto and the other corporate giants. \n&#xa0;\nThe NFU top brass might want us to go in that direction in the UK, but to do so would be crass and -- in our view -- even suicidal.\n&#xa0;\nFrom a farming/\nfood standpoint, international experience of GM cultivation has demonstrated the following:\n&#xa0;\n(a) Yields have not increased as promised (2). In fact, since the hybrids used for GM breeding \nprogrammes\n are not always the highest-yielding varieties, GM crops c\nan perform worse than their non-GM counterparts. Many studies from around the world have shown that apparent yield increases are short-lived and are based upon carefully selected comparisons with less effective non-GM lines. \n&#xa0;\nIn fact, productivity increase\ns have been greater in the non-GM farming context of Europe than in the GM farming system of the United States. (3) \n&#xa0;\nIn fact, an increased dependence upon GM varieties is associated with increased uniformity in regional farming systems -- and increased vul\nnerability to climatic fluctuations and pest attack. \n&#xa0;\nAs ever, the greatest food security is to be found within systems that are diverse and adaptable. That is why mixed farming systems are much more stable.\n&#xa0;\n(b) \n&#xa0;\nReliance on pesticides, herbicides, and \nfe\nrtilisers\n has increased - not decreased as promised (4). This is now confirmed by abundant studies, in spite of a constant stream of lies from the GM industry. The great majority of GM crops in the market place are designed for herbicide tolerance and for \n\"chemical management\" scenarios; it is through sales of complete seed / \nherbicide packages that the GM corporations make their money. \n&#xa0;\nAnd they are careful to ensure that they carry no liability for externalities like health damage costs and environmental \nremediation. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n(c) \n&#xa0;\nWeeds and pests have developed resistance to GM crops and pesticides resulting in '\nsuperweeds\n' and 'superbugs' that need even larger amounts (and an increased range) of herbicides and pesticides for their control (5). The \"toxic chemic\nal farming\" scenario is thus reinforced, with \nunforseen\n ecological consequences.\n&#xa0;\n(d) \n&#xa0;\nThere have always been problems with cross contamination and cross \nfertilisation\n between GM and non-GM crops. These have led to \n&#xa0;\nlengthy law suits and are a potentially \nexplosive problem if more GM crops are planted (6). It is now recognized that the coexistence of non-GM and GM crops is impossible. GM canola, which has many wild relatives, is impossible to contain (7).\n&#xa0;\n(e) \n&#xa0;\nThis technology is expensive and costly for \nfarmers and makes them more dependent on the agribusiness giants in order to sustain a livelihood. They are \"tied in\" to corporate dependence by strict patent laws and \"technology use agreements.\" They cannot save seed, and they cannot dispose of their har\nvests except through approved channels. Monsanto and other corporations employ quite brutal patent enforcement methods in all \nneighbourhoods\n where their GM crops are grown (8).\n&#xa0;\n(f) There are proven health risks associated with GM technology, in spite of w\nhat the GM establishment tells us (9). There are many instances of domestic animal deaths following consumption of GM crops. Many independent studies (including those of \nSeralini\n, Carman, \nMalatesta\n and \nErmakova\n) have found damage to the internal organs of \nanimals fed on GM components, and they demonstrate that the public is right \n&#xa0;\nto be very seriously concerned about GM food safety. Advisory bodies such as ACRE, FSA and EFSA still refuse to acknowledge the serious nature of these findings, and stand widely \naccused of gross negligence.\n&#xa0;\n(g) \n&#xa0;\nGM technology has not reduced levels of world hunger as promised. In fact, it has made poor farmers more indebted and less self sufficient, and consequently more vulnerable than ever before. Bankruptcies associated with B\nT cotton in India have caused many thousands of suicides (10). \n&#xa0;\nIn the United States, where GM crops are grown on a vast scale, there has been NO reduction in \"food poverty\" and malnutrition amongst poor people.\n&#xa0;\n(h) \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nConsumers throughout Europe have cons\nistently voted against growing GM crops. There are now thousands of \"GM Free regions\" across Europe, and a growing GM resistance movement (11). Consumers are aware of the failure of the GM industry to deliver on its promises, and they know that GM crops an\nd foods bring them no benefits whatsoever. For many years the UK government has been telling people that GM crops and foods are safe and essential; now it is time for the government to start listening instead. \n&#xa0;\nFor more than a decade the Government seems t\no have thought that public \nopinion on GMOs is based upon emotion, hysteria and a lack of scientific understanding. \n&#xa0;\nIf we may say so, that assumption is arrogant and misguided. \n&#xa0;\nThe members of the public have a very subtle and nuanced understanding of GM i\nssues -- and if anything the \"hysterical\" \n&#xa0;\nrants relating to GM crops and foods come nowadays from none other than the Secretary of State!\n&#xa0;\n(\ni\n) \n&#xa0;\nIt is seldom acknowledged that one part of the \"global food control\" strategy employed by the GM multinationals\n is the purchasing of seed companies and their catalogues and the phasing out of locally adapted varieties (12). This means that biodiversity is irreparably damaged, and that vast swathes of countryside are planted with GM crop monocultures and with GM var\nieties that are ill-suited to local environmental conditions. This endangers food security and increases the risk of future famine (13).\n&#xa0;\n(j) \n&#xa0;\nThe GM corporations and the trade associations seeking to extol the virtues of GM crops are adept at spreading di\nsinformation, practicing corrupt science in the approvals process, and vilifying scientists who seek to undertake independent research into GM crop safety and environmental impacts (14). They have shown over and again that they cannot be trusted, and yet g\novernments unaccountably continue to accord them respect, and seek to \"enable\" their corporate global ambitions. \n&#xa0;\nQuite recently, the UK government stated that it would support Monsanto in court to further its ambitions to introduce an untested \"stacked\" G\nMO variety of maize into the European farming system.\n&#xa0;\n(k) \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIt is not just hydrocarbon prices that are rocketing upwards in the \"peak oil\" scenario. Petrochemical and feedstock prices are also rising inexorably, and Roundup (the \nweedkiller\n for which most \nGM crops are engineered) is more and more expensive (15). GM farming will soon be seen as an expensive luxury, if not an absurd aberration, caught up in an inexorable inflationary spiral.\n&#xa0;\n(l) \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe GM industry, aided and abetted by the Government, has bee\nn partly responsible for a decline in scientific ethics and a disastrous decline in the public acceptance of science. \n&#xa0;\nSir David King claimed some years ago that Britain had \"lost\" inward investment worth £2-3 billion because of our failure to adopt GM tec\nhnology (16); on the contrary, because of the GM industry's strategy of \"contamination by stealth\" the UK taxpayer has already had to pay a substantial bill for the monitoring and remediation of contamination incidents involving failed and \nunauthorised\n GM \nvarieties found in the food chain.\n&#xa0;\n(m) \n&#xa0;\nThose who own GM crop and agrochemical patents refuse absolutely to accept liability for damage that might be caused to farming \nneighbours\n and members of the public, arising out of genetic trespass and contamination\n. Such risks are also uninsurable, as no insurance companies will provide cover (17). It must be concluded that in their view the risks of damage and litigation far outweigh any possible benefits that might come from GM crop plantings. In that context, it \nwould be an act of sheer madness for any government to permit any commercial GM planting in the UK to go ahead.\n&#xa0;\nCONCLUSIONS&#xa0;\nIn short, there is not the slightest chance that GM crops and foods will do anything to alleviate future problems associated with \nwater shortages, famine and unrest and instability in the Developing Nations. If GM crops are forced on unwilling or reluctant recipients, there will be strongly negative consequences for public health, biodiversity and sustainable agriculture. Corporate f\neudalism will be extended, and there will be dramatic social, political and economic consequences for all of us.\n&#xa0;\nWe urge you to accept the points made in the IAASTD report of some years ago (18), and to endorse a pattern of agriculture which is sustainabl\ne, independent of high chemical and energy inputs, and responsive to local needs and aspirations. This means that GM technology will have to be consigned to the scrap heap, where it properly belongs, even if Monsanto and the other biotechnology corporation\ns squeal about their global ambitions being thwarted and even if a few GM technologists are forced to do something more worthwhile with their time.\n&#xa0;\nFinally, we wish to comment on the recent research findings which link GM crops and Roundup herbicide to he\nalth damage in animals. \n&#xa0;\nA scientific paper published in September 2012 in the American journal Food and Chemical Toxicology demonstrates unequivocally that both GM crops and the herbicides used with them cause health damage and premature death in mammals \n(19). \n&#xa0;\nThis research project, completed at the University of Caen in France, involved a prolonged (24 month) feeding study with the use of 200 rats divided into ten groups. It showed quite clearly that Roundup, manufactured by Monsanto, is toxic to mammals\n even in minute doses, leading to kidney and liver damage, \ntumours\n and premature death. It also showed that Monsanto's GM herbicide tolerant maize NK603 is toxic in its own right, with or without the presence of Roundup residues. Animals fed on \"clean\" GM \nmaize suffered from very similar toxic effects and from early deaths. By comparison, the control group of animals fed on conventional maize and clean water showed hardly any of the negative effects experienced by the test group animals. \n&#xa0;\nLike many of the c\nlassic scientific projects through the years, this one was essentially very simple, involving the continuous feeding of ten groups of animals over a 24-month period, using either GM or non-GM maize in their diets, and with or without the addition of minute\n quantities of Roundup in drinking water. The researchers simply observed \n&#xa0;\nand monitored, in a classic toxicology study, what happened to the animals. This was the first time such a long-term study had ever been reported on -- since conventionally all GM s\nafety assessments are based on 3-month feeding studies, which are too short for chronic toxic effects to be fully revealed. \n&#xa0;\nIn other radical departures, the researchers (1) refused to test \nglyphosate\n (the main constituent of Roundup) and insisted on testi\nng the whole Roundup formulation; and (2) tested the actual GM maize instead of \"surrogate proteins.\"\n&#xa0;\nAs the Committee will be aware, this study has been viciously attacked by \nscientists who have links with the GMO industry, and even by those scientists f\nrom bodies like EFSA and ACRE who have in the past declared NK603 and Roundup to be perfectly safe. \n&#xa0;\nProfessor \nSeralini\n has been personally vilified, and he and his colleagues have been accused of scientific fraud. \n&#xa0;\nThe journal which published the paper af\nter due process of peer review was bombarded with protests about the paper and eventually succumbed to this pressure, finally retracting the paper more than a year after publication. \n&#xa0;\nThat was a black day for science, illustrating that Monsanto and its coh\norts now effectively own not just large swathes of biotechnology research but also the means of scientific publication. \n&#xa0;\nIt should be noted that the paper was retracted not because it contained fraud, data manipulation or misinterpretation (the authors are\n specifically cleared of any wrongdoing on all of those counts) -- but because it was deemed to be \"inconclusive\" \n&#xa0;\nas a cancer study (20). \n&#xa0;\nBut it was never intended to be a cancer study; \n&#xa0;\nand how many scientific papers are actually \"conclusive\" enough to \neffectively eliminate the need for further research? The vilification campaign and the process by which the paper was retracted brings shame upon the scientific community, especially since nobody has come forward with any evidence to counteract or contradi\nct the \nSeralini\n findings. \n&#xa0;\nOn the contrary, the \nSeralini\n findings are supported in another study based upon US pig autopsies by Carman et al (21), by the findings of pig farmer \nIb\n Pedersen in Denmark (22) and by the observations of veterinarians (23). \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe research results reported in the \nSeralini\n paper are both dramatic and far-reaching; we predict that it is destined to become one of the most widely-cited and influential publications of the century, even though it is currently retracted. It is now impo\nssible for the GM industry and bodies like EFSA to maintain the pretence that GM food -- with or without Roundup residues -- is safe either for human or livestock consumption. GM food is toxic. We have been saying this for a decade or more, on the basis of\n published science -- and the matter is now incontrovertible. We can manage perfectly well without GM in the human food chain in Europe, since few GM components are used. But what happens next within the EU livestock industry, which is heavily dependent up\non the import of toxic GM soy from South America? We have warned over and again that over-dependence on a single protein source is both stupid and highly dangerous, and now the \"perfect storm\" is about to roll over us. We hope that the \nthe\n UK Government an\nd the Commission have got a Plan B in place, but somehow we doubt it.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\nNOTES&#xa0;\n(1) \n&#xa0;\nOwen Paterson: the minister for GM hype, by \nZac\n Goldsmith, The Guardian, 24 October 2013\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/24/owen-paterson-minister-gm-hype?CMP=twt_fd\nhttp://www.gmwatch.org/index.php/news/archive/2013/15131-owen-paterson-the-minister-for-gm-hype\n&#xa0;\n(2) GM Crop Risk Assessment Challenges: An Overview 2.
