[normal]              
[normal]Introduction
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.
[normal]1
[normal]              
[normal]I am pleased to have the opportu
[normal]ni
[normal]ty to 
[normal]contribute
[normal] to the Committee’s inquiry into Parliament’s 
[normal]Ombudsman
[normal] Service
[normal] and to 
[normal]share with the
[normal] Committee my experiences as Northern Ireland 
[normal]Ombudsman
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]              
[normal]I curre
[normal]ntly hold two statutory offices,
[normal] that of Assembly 
[normal]Ombudsman
[normal] for 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal] and the 
[normal]Northern 
[normal]Ireland
[normal] Commissioner for Complaints.  I have held both offices since September 2000.  In my role as Assembly 
[normal]Ombudsman
[normal], I have 
[normal]the authority
[normal] to investigate complaints of maladmi
[normal]ni
[normal]stration 
[normal]made 
[normal]against 
[normal]Northern Ireland Departments and their statutory agenci
[normal]es.  As 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal] Commissioner for Complaints, I 
[normal]have the authority to
[normal] investigate complaints of maladmi
[normal]ni
[normal]stration about local authorities, housing, health and social care bodies a
[normal]nd a wide range of arms length 
[normal]authorities
[normal] including 
[normal]a number of 
[normal]just
[normal]ice
[normal] bodies
[normal] in 
[normal]Northern Irelan
[normal]d
[normal].  I
[normal]n
[normal] addition, a number of statutory 
[normal]regulatory bodies
[normal] are within my jurisdiction; these include the 
[normal]Eq
[normal]u
[normal]ality
[normal] 
[normal]C
[normal]ommission for 
[normal]Northern Irel
[normal]a
[normal]nd
[normal], the Northern Ireland Children and Young Persons Commissioner, and the Commissioner
[normal] for 
[normal]Older People 
[normal]for 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]Like 
[normal]the current 
[normal]PHSO, I h
[normal]a
[normal]ve a jurisdiction in respect of health complaints which 
[normal]also allows
[normal] me to examine the cli
[normal]ni
[normal]cal judgement of health professionals including general health service provi
[normal]d
[normal]ers and 
[normal]independent
[normal] health 
[normal]service 
[normal]providers.
[normal]  Because health and social care are provided as an integrated service in 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal], I can investigate cases across 
[normal]the full spectrum of health
[normal] and social care.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3 
[normal]              
[normal]Throughout my time as Northern Ireland 
[normal]Omb
[normal]u
[normal]d
[normal]sman, I have
[normal] seen a steady increase
[normal] 
[normal]in 
[normal]citizen
[normal]’s
[normal] 
[normal]accessing
[normal] 
[normal]my office to seek redress for 
[normal]injustice 
[normal]resulting from 
[normal]the admi
[normal]ni
[normal]strative 
[normal]failu
[normal]re of bodies in my jurisdiction.  In particular, in the first six months of this financial year, complaints to my office overall 
[normal]have increased by 3
[normal]1
[normal]% and 
[normal]within this the
[normal] health jurisdiction 
[normal]figure 
[normal]has 
[normal]seen
[normal] an increase of over 
[normal]35
[normal]%.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4 
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]citizen
[normal] can complain to my office 
[normal]at any point in their service journey but I
[normal] normally expect the complainant to have exhausted the complaints 
[normal]process of the body 
[normal]that ha
[normal]s
[normal] provided the service
[normal] before bringing a complaint to me.  This 
[normal]approach confirms
[normal] the role of my office as the office of last resort in respect of citizen
[normal]’s
[normal] complaints 
[normal]particularly where they 
[normal]relate to
[normal] poo
[normal]r
[normal] admi
[normal]ni
[normal]stration.  
[normal]Curre
[normal]ntly, as happens with the 
[normal]PHSO, there is a filter for complaints to my office in 
[normal]my role as Assembly 
[normal]Ombudsman
[normal] where an individual is alleging
[normal] maladmi
[normal]ni
[normal]stration by 
[normal]Government 
[normal]Depar
[normal]t
[normal]ments and their agencies.  
[normal]This filter requires that
[normal] the 
[normal]complainant secure
[normal]s
[normal] sponsorship 
[normal]of their
[normal] complaint
[normal] by a member of 
[normal]the 
[normal]Northern 
[normal]Ireland Assembly
[normal].  It is probable
[normal] that 
[normal]this barrier 
[normal]will
[normal] be removed 
[normal]if 
[normal]the 
[normal]legislative changes that are currently being 
[normal]proposed
[normal] by the
[normal] 
[normal]OFMdFM
[normal] Committee of the
[normal] 
[normal]Northern Ireland 
[normal]Assembly
[normal] 
[normal]are imple
[normal]mented
[normal].

[normal]              
[normal]The Landscape of Ombudsmen and Complaint Handlers in the 
[normal]UK
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]              
[normal]The landscape of ombudsme
[normal]n and complaint handlers in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] 
[normal]dealing with complaints about public services and consumer grievances 
[normal]is
[normal], in my view, 
[normal]crowded
[normal].  T
[normal]his 
[normal]often 
[normal]can be 
[normal]confusing for the citizen who seeks redress for injus
[normal]tice.  
[normal]In order to refine
[normal] the redress landscape, t
[normal]he devolved government
[normal]s in 
[normal]Scotland
[normal] and 
[normal]Wales
[normal] 
[normal]consulted on the roles and remit of various ombudsmen schemes
[normal] in those countries
[normal]. As a result 
[normal]a single 
[normal]offi
[normal]ce of 
[normal]Public Services 
[normal]Ombudsman
[normal] 
[normal]was created 
[normal]in 
[normal]Scotland
[normal] in 2002 and in 
[normal]Wales
[normal] in 2005 in order 
[normal]to deal
[normal] with complaints of maladmi
[normal]ni
[normal]stration about 
[normal]those 
[normal]devolved 
[normal]bodies who deliver public services.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]              
[normal]This ‘one stop shop model’ for complaints about publi
[normal]c administration has, in essence, been in existence in 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal] since 1969 with the creation of the statutory offices of Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration for 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal] and 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal] Commissioner for Complaints. 
[normal]While 
[normal]thes
[normal]e of
[normal]f
[normal]ices were rebranded 
[normal]in 1996, 
[normal]as Assembly Ombudsman for Northern Ireland and Northern Ireland Commissioner for Complaints 
[normal]respectively, they 
[normal]have
[normal], 
[normal]since their inception
[normal] ( with one exception), 
[normal] been 
[normal]held by the same 
[normal]o
[normal]mbudsman with
[normal] staff inves
[normal]tigat
[normal]ing 
[normal]co
[normal]mplaints spanning central
[normal] and 
[normal]local gov
[normal]ernment, health and social 
[normal]care, housing
[normal] and other public services across both 
[normal]statutory remits.
[normal].
[normal] A
[normal]n
[normal] 
[normal]independent review of 
[normal]the 
[normal]office by Deloitte in 2004 
[normal]recommended legislation
[normal] to merge the
[normal]se
[normal] 
[normal]statutory offices
[normal]. W
[normal]hen 
[normal]enacted
[normal] this will
[normal] give
[normal] 
[normal]legal 
[normal]effect to the devolved 
[normal]ombudsman model o
[normal]f a 
[normal]one stop shop for complaints about 
[normal]local 
[normal]public services
[normal].
[normal]  The 
[normal]development of legislative proposals 
[normal]for 
[normal]th
[normal]a
[normal]t
[normal] single office
[normal], to be known as the 
[normal]Northern Ireland Public Services 
[normal]Ombudsm
[normal]an
[normal] (
[normal]N
[normal]I
[normal]PSO) 
[normal]has been undertaken by the
[normal] OFMdFM Committee and this legislation 
[normal]will be introduced into the Assembly in 
[normal]early 
[normal]2014.  While the specific provisions are still to be 
[normal]drafted, 
[normal]debated and scruti
[normal]ni
[normal]sed, I welcome the 
[normal]OFMdFM
[normal] Committee’s 
[normal]particular
[normal] con
[normal]t
[normal]rib
[normal]ut
[normal]ion and commitment to introducing this legislation which 
[normal]will modernise
[normal] 
[normal]my 
[normal]O
[normal]ffice
[normal] and provide greater access 
[normal]for
[normal] citizen
[normal]s to remedy and redress when public
[normal] 
[normal]service
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]in 
[normal]N
[normal]orthern 
[normal]Ir
[normal]eland
[normal] fail them.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]              
[normal]Access to Parliament’s 
[normal]Ombudsman
[normal] Service
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]To e
[normal]nsure that all cit
[normal]izens have direct access to an o
[normal]mbudsman, having exhausted 
[normal]the internal complaints procedure of bodies
[normal], it is important that
[normal] 
[normal]any barriers to accessibility 
[normal]to further redress 
[normal]are
[normal] removed.  Sponsorship by a Member of Parliament or 
[normal]members o
[normal]f a
[normal] Legislative Assembly should not, in my view, be a requirement
[normal] 
[normal]in
[normal] bringing a complaint to an 
[normal]omb
[normal]u
[normal]dsman
[normal].  The 
[normal]‘
[normal]twin-track approach
[normal]’
[normal] as proposed by the Law Commission for 
[normal]England
[normal] and 
[normal]Wales
[normal] would ensure that the citizen who wishes to complain has, if he or she so chooses, the support of their MP or MLA in bringing a complaint to an 
[normal]o
[normal]mbudsman
[normal].  This 
[normal]would also help maintain that vital link between the legislature and 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]Ombudsman
[normal] which is ne
[normal]cessary to ensure that 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment 
[normal]departments and public bodies are
[normal] held to account 
[normal]f
[normal]or 
[normal]the
[normal] quality and delivery of public services.
[normal]  The Committee may also wish to note the development of monthly bulletins and case digests in 
[normal]Scotland
[normal], 
[normal]Wales
[normal] and 
[normal]Northern 
[normal]Ireland
[normal] that offer an alternative means of keeping elected members 
[normal]updated
[normal] about 
[normal]the nature, number and source of 
[normal]cases and complaints being raised by citizens.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]              
[normal]In 
[normal]Scotland
[normal] and 
[normal]Wales
[normal],
[normal] the ‘filter’ has already been removed in relation to complaints abo
[normal]ut central government
[normal] departments
[normal].  In 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal],
[normal] I am on record as 
[normal]ask
[normal]ing for the removal
[normal] of the MLA filter in relation to complaints about 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal]  
[normal] Departments.  In my role as 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal] Commissioner for Complaints dealing with hea
[normal]lth and social care
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]local government and public services, 
[normal]no such requirement exists.  This
[normal] dichotomy between the two regimes
[normal] is confusing for the public who seek to 
[normal]access
[normal] my office.  I therefore welcome the 
[normal]policy 
[normal]proposal of the 
[normal]OFMdFM
[normal] Committee to rep
[normal]lace the MLA filter with the 
[normal]‘
[normal]twin track approach
[normal]’
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.
[normal]              
[normal]Ombudsmen and Powers of Own Initiative
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1
[normal]              
[normal]In the 
[normal]UK
[normal], an 
[normal]Ombudsman
[normal] model has developed which is dependent on the citizen pursuing a complaint.  This is not the model which has developed 
[normal]i
[normal]nternationally where 
[normal]organisations such as the European Ombudsman, 
[normal]have the power to commence an investigation 
[normal]without first receiving a complaint
[normal] 
[normal]from a citizen
[normal].  
[normal]In the 
[normal]Republic
[normal] of 
[normal]Ireland
[normal], the Ombudsman has discretion to commence such an investigation a
[normal]nd this has been used sparingly but to significant effect
[normal].  The value of an ‘own-initiative’ power is that it can deliver systemic improvements for a greater number of citizens and not just the complainant in a particular case.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]              
[normal]The Deloitte Review recommended that the NIPSO have a power to commence an investigation where there is evidence of systemic maladministration.  
[normal]I am pleased to note that the
[normal] 
[normal]OFMdFM
[normal] policy proposals provide for such a power in the 
[normal]proposed 
[normal]N
[normal]IPSO 
[normal]legislatio
[normal]n
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.

[normal]The Reformed 
[normal]Ombudsman
[normal]’s 
[normal]Office
[normal] Relationship with Parliament’s Select Committee
[normal]s
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1
[normal]              
[normal]Public Services 
[normal]o
[normal]mbudsmen exist to
[normal] provide a
[normal] service
[normal] for
[normal] the citizen, the wider public and Parliament itself.   
[normal]They play a unique role in reflecting to Parliament
[normal] the concerns of the ‘governed’ about the services overseen and provided by Government.  It is important therefore that Public Services ombudsmen have a mechanism for bringing the results of their investigations to th
[normal]e attention of a Parliament or l
[normal]egislat
[normal]ive Assembly.  
[normal]I currently produce periodic case digests and an annual report which I lay before the Northern Ireland Assembly.  The Assembly’s response has been that 
[normal]the relevant
[normal] 
[normal]S
[normal]elect 
[normal]C
[normal]ommittee ha
[normal]s
[normal] invited me to give evidence of the issues raised in the
[normal]se reports.  
[normal]For instance, I have given evidence to the Committee for the Environment on issues arising from complaints to my Office about the planning service and the Committee for Finance and Personnel about complaints relating to public procurement.  I 
[normal]welcome this opportunity to inform the relevant Select Committee about the results of my investigations which may assist a Committee’s deliberations and considerations of related issues, by providing a real time and, importantly, independent perspective on
[normal] the citizen’s experience of public services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal]              
[normal]The role of informing Parliament of the overall outcome and findings of the Ombudsman across his/her range of investigations should be undertaken by a separate Select Committee from the Committee that is s
[normal]crutinising the financial and administrative performance of the Ombudsman’s office. 
[normal]Scrutiny of an 
[normal]o
[normal]mbudsman
[normal]’s performance by a single Select Committee is a necessary role to ensure that 
[normal]the 
[normal]service is operating effectively 
[normal]and efficiently, 
[normal]and is 
[normal]providin
[normal]g an appropriate, 
[normal]proper 
[normal]account 
[normal]of the 
[normal]guardianship of 
[normal]his/her
[normal] remit and expenditure.  I currently do not report directly to a 
[normal]specific 
[normal]Committee in 
[normal]relation to this separate aspect of my role
[normal]. 
[normal]  However, i
[normal]t is proposed that the financial performance of t
[normal]he new 
[normal]NI
[normal]PSO
[normal] be subject to the scrutiny 
[normal]by
[normal] the Audit Committee
[normal] of the Northern Ireland Assembly.

[normal]The Role of a Complaints Standards Authority

[normal]The establish
[normal]ment of a

[normal]Standards
[normal] 
[normal]A
[normal]uthority was debated by the 
[normal]OFMdFM
[normal] Committee when considering 
[normal]the
[normal] policy 
[normal]framework that would inform its approach to the proposed
[normal] 
[normal]N
[normal]I
[normal]PSO Bill.  The Committee considered this was no
[normal]t an appropriate role for the NIPSO 
[normal]and after due consideration, I 
[normal]have 
[normal]accept
[normal]ed
[normal] this view.  A different model 
[normal]has emerged in 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal] to ensure a standardised approach to complaints handling 
[normal]in
[normal] 
[normal]our jurisdiction
[normal].  In 2009, I published guidance on standards for effective complaint handling
[normal].  I am pleased to note that these standards have been adopted by the
[normal] interdepartmental group on 
[normal]complaints
[normal] handling convened by the Permanent Secretary Group for Northern Ireland (PSG).  As a result, the following recommendations of that interdepartmental group are being implem
[normal]e
[normal]nted as follows:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I welcome this initiative and my office will continue to engage with the PSG and the interdepartmental group members to assist in these significant innova
[normal]tions in 
[normal]the 
[normal]complaint handling 
[normal]of public bodies 
[normal]in 
[normal]Northern Ireland
