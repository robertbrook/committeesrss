As soon as the tr\naffic signal cleared\n she made a decision to\n start\n cycling. W\nithin a distance of few metres she was horrified \nto \nfound herself \nhit by a\n \nlorry. \nThe resulting collision event\n, a tragic event,\n took away her precious life\n before any medical\n help could be afforded to her\n. \n&#xa0;\nApproximately year ago, Transport for London installed an Early Start Traffic Light Scheme at the Bow Roundabout to improve safety at the Bow Roundabout\n \n(BBC News, 2013)\n. Prior to this safety intervention, a Cycle Super Highways (Blue Colour pathway) Scheme was introduced by the Transport for London in 2010. Transport for London\n took a decision to make these interventions after consultation with \ncy\ncling, road user and safety organisations\n \n(Mayor of London, May 2013)\n.\nThe actions \nof various people directly involved in the tragic situation are examined hereafter\n using the information afforded by the Transport for London vi\ndeo showing the Concept of Operations\n. \nConcept of Operations is a systems engineering term to describe\n to the user how to use the proposed system. More details on Concept of Operations can be accessed on the Web\n.\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe woman \ncyclist (Person A) \nwas afforded \ninformation by the Early Start \nBicycle Signal \nSystem\n to go West\n on her planned route starting from Cycle Super Highway\n \nCS2 \nAdvanced Stop \nLine (ASL)\n.  \nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Lorry driver\n (Person B) was\n afforded information by the \nRoad t\nraffic Signal \nSystem \nto go across on \nhis planned route\n few moments\n later\n. \nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe specification and implementation of the \nRoad Traffic Control System, Early Start Signal \nSystem and Cycle Superhighway \nCS2 Advanced Stop Line \nassumed \nthat \ncycle and lorry routes do not conflict\n with each other follo\nwing the \ninstallation of the Early Start Bicycle Signal System\n and CS2 Advanced Stop Line\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nFrom the above it is clear that both woman cyclist and the lorry driver did not have any \nvisual percep\ntion of each other’s route IS\n in conflict\n in the \ncircular (sh\nared\n space\n) passageway away\n from the\n \nCycle Super Highway CS2\n. \n&#xa0;\nConjunction of the three events \ntransformed normal safe acts of cycling and vehicle \ndriving \ninto unsafe acts posing risk to life of Venera\n Minakhmetova\n. Author speculates \nat this stage of inv\nestigation that this conjunction of events went \nun\nrecognised at the planning, review and \ndelivery stages of the schemes. \nPerhaps, t\nhe integrated risk assessment and reviews were not conducted by traffic engineer\ns or designers or contractors as they \nwere co\nnducted for the London Olympics 2012\n.\n \nAuthor discounts the possibility that the skills of dead cyclist and lorry driver were deficient in this case. Nor was this case of hit-run accident as the lorry driver stopped after the accident. \n&#xa0;\nThe te\nxt in the fo\nllowing \nsection presents \nthe \nidea of\n Syste\nms Thinking \nApproach to \nSafety. \nThis a\npproach was presented by author in hi\ns publication in 2006\n and in free online publication in 2012\n \n(Appicharla, 2006)\n,\n \n(Appicharla, 2012)\n. \nThis follows the \nSoft Systems Thinking \ntradition started by Peter Checkland\n \n(Checkland, 2000)\n. \n&#xa0;\nThe hypotheses underlying the Systems Thinking Approach to Safety are as under:\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRelease of harmful energy\n is a prior co\nndition\n/state\n to any \nphysical \nevent involving harm\n \nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLack of \nprotective measures to \nmitigate the harmful energy so released leads\n to injuries, loss\n of limbs and lives\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nManagerial oversights and assumed risk \n(acceptable\n \nrisks are\n risks accepted \nby an authority after a formal risk \nassessment)\n are \nfallible decisions that trigger the accidental flow of events. \n&#xa0;\nThe single factor behind the lack of availability of safety measures to guard against the release of hazardous energy is\n the \nsystematic \nerrors committed (\ninherent biases\n)\n in safety evaluations and risk assessments. Therefore, \nthe \nutility of Systems Thinking Approach to Safety lies in screening out of hazardous scenarios from the concept of operations itself such that either the activity it\nself can be modified or specification of the infrastructure and control systems may be written in a such way that probability of hazardous scenarios can be eliminated or controlled to the extent that it is no longer a cause for concern. \n&#xa0;\nObjections agains\nt the utility of Systems Thinking Approach to Safety by the adherents of traditional probabilisti\nc and/or statistical \napproach to risk management \nare answered in t\nhis way. T\nraditional method of estimatin\ng numerically the risk \nposed by\n an activity using the\n data collected from past accidents and \nby treating accident\n fatalities \nas a random variable does not yield insight into whether \nthe activity is itself is safe or not due to availability \nand representative \nbiases (pp137)\n \n(Kahneman, \n2011)\n. \n&#xa0;\nTraditional d\necision making process entails making choices for the future to solve a given problem with various constraints impinging upon the solution. Both in theory and practise, \nutilitarian \ndecision making entails a view to be taken of pr\nevalent state of affair(s)\n and partition them into risk less and risky choices \n. \nThis representation takes the shape of an event tree diagram and probabilities are worked out against each outcome used in probabilistic risk assessment used by risk assessor \nand managers. The details of probabilistic risk assessment and its inadequacy to deal with human error were discussed by James Reason and therefore, not discussed again (pp219)\n \n(Reason, 1990)\n. \n&#xa0;\nProspect theory advanced by Nobe\nl Laureate Daniel Kahneman and his collab\norator, Amos Tversky, highlights errors in\n the traditional utilitarian decision making and suggest the idea that emotions of hope and fear colour the \nchoices we make when we want \nconfront the problem of decis\nion mak\ning under risk. \nThus, drawing lessons from the Prospect \nTheory\n \nand his own 2010 publication \nauthor arrives at the judgement that long standing debate on morality and economics of safety can be concluded in favour of morality. \nAuthor’s 2010 publication argu\ned that \nGroup-think bias\n is major factor in decision makin\ng when setting safety standards was\n noted by \n \n(Appicharla, 2010)\n. \n&#xa0;\nThe Figure 1 presents the data given by Danny Williams, a cyclist blogger to the BBC News\n. \nFigure 1: Data on cycle trips a day and fatalities Year\nAverage cycle trips a day\nFatalities\n2002\n300,000\n20\n2003\n320,000\n19\n2004\n330,000\n8\n2005\n390,000\n21\n2006\n420,000\n19\n2007\n420,000\n15\n2008\n440,000\n15\n2009\n470,000\n13\n2010\n490,000\n10\n2011\n500,000\n16\n&#xa0;\nIf we consider the accident metric of fatality per millions of\n cycle trips then the data is presented in the form of \na s\ncatter Graph using Microsoft excel for the ten observation periods.  The accident metric has never fallen below 2.04 deaths per million of cycle trips during the \npast \nten observation \nperiods (See Figure2).   \nMoreover the inspection of the graph shows that \nthere is no co-relation between the average cycle trips per day and the resulting fatalities. \n&#xa0;\nThe figure of 2.04 deaths per million of cycle trips can be regarded as a subjective measure of mortality risk as per Paul Slovic‘s psychological criteria\n \n(Kahneman, 2011)\n. However, the figure compared against a scientific criterion of chances of death per million, it is clear that the human activit\ny of cycling in London\n has become dangerous.\n&#xa0;\nFigure \n2\n Scatter\n graph representation \n&#xa0;\nThe risk \nassessment \ncriterion of one chance per million opportunities is\n derived from Ian Murphy’s 1997 publication\n \n(Murphy, 1997)\n. \nApart from one outlier \n(2008) \nduring the observational \nperiod where the metric went down to 8 fatalities, the fatalities have been consistently in the double figure range. \nFurther\n, statistics perspective of fatalities calculated are mean=15.6, median = 15.5, mode is 19 and standard deviation is 4.32. From thes\ne figures, using a Poisson probability distribution, the probability of first fatality is less than .04%. \n Author is of the opinion that cautious behaviour on part of the cyclists and road drivers shows up as a constraint upon the accident fatalities in ac\ncordance with Dr Ashby’s perspective\n \n(Ashby, 1957)\n. \n&#xa0;\nAuthor has noted that risk of death from a cardio vascular heart \ndisease (\nCVD) \nis greater than risk tha\nn death from a cycle accident\n. It is expected by World Health Organisation that \nsome 23\n.3 million deaths are likely\n due to CVD in 2030. \n The most important behavioural risk factors of heart disease and stroke are unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobac\nco use and harmful use of alcohol. Behavioural risk factors are responsible for about 80% of coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease\n. \n&#xa0;\nHowever, the text \nin this section shows that \nresearch into behavioural attitudes of cyclists as suggested by \nTransport for London document is \nnot useful \nactivity\n. Let us consider the fact that \nin 2009 there were 13 fatalities \nand 3396 injuries (see Chapter 2 London Transport document).  \nFrom t\nhese figures \nit can be inferred that\n there were 3409 collision events\n between a cyclist and other vehicle\n in the following manner\n. \n&#xa0;\nUsing \nthe Bayesian Rules of conditional probabilities, we \ncan work out the probabilities of human actors’ performance \n \n(Pal &amp; Sarkar, 2005)\n. \nTotal \nnumber of collis\nion events \nreported \nin 2009= 3409. For risk computational purposes, it is assumed that there are 10,000 hours per annum. \nLet \nP (\nB) den\note the total probability of interactions between road vehicle and cyclists. \nThe base rate of injurious collisions \nevents \nper year \nsuffered by cyclists\n= P (A) = 3409/10000= 0.3409\nThe base r\nate of non –fatal non- injurious interaction events \nper year = P (A\nC\n) = 1-0.3409= 0.6591\nThe probabi\nlity of a fatality given a colli\nsion situation = P (B/A) = 13/3409= .00381\nThe pr\nobability of an \ninjury given a colli\nsion situation = P (B\nC\n/A) = 3396/3409=0.99619.\n&#xa0;\nThe\n number \nof \nevents in which \nroad vehicle driver’s unreliability is indicated by the ratio \n= \nP (\nB\nC\n/A\nC\n) =\n \n13*6561/3409= 25.\n \nThus, the probability of fatality involving a \ncyclist\n’s unreliable performance in\n creating a collusion situation = 13/13+25= .3411 or 34%. \nThe rest 66% contribution to danger can be attributed to road users and other authorities. \nThis way of calculation can be\n \nevaluated using the example of accident a\nnalysis given by the Bayesian inference \nby Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman\n \n(Kahneman, 2011)\n. \n&#xa0;\nJames Reason (1990) argued that problem solvers tend to over simply causality (pp91)\n \n(Reason, 1990)\n. Cau\nsal explanations suffer from various kinds of biases. \nAuthor has noted the fact Nobel Laureate Bertrand Russell’s \nperceptual \naccount o\nf everyday world\n of seeing, hearing, touching, smelling and tasting subs\ntances is an illusion. \nBertrand Russell may be ech\noing the ancient statement of Epicharamus that it is the mind that sees and hears; all besides is deaf and blind is stated by Arthur Schopenhauer\n \n(Schopenhaeur, 1813/2006)\n.  \nAccording to Arthur Schopenhauer, to order to contemp\nlate an explanation for a particular thing, one must assume that there is subject (oneself) that thinks about the object \n(to\n be explained)\n. However, in the cases of explaining a sequence of events that led to an accidental death, we must be carefully to av\noid repeating errors committed by David Hume and Immanuel Kant in their causal explanations. David Hume asserts that all consequence is mere sequence of perceptions whereas Kant affirms that all sequence of perceptions must necessarily be consequence. The \nlaw of causality is not known to us empirically but is given a priory (pp 106\n/107\n)\n \n(Schopenhaeur, 1813/2006)\n. \n&#xa0;\nO\nverthrowing of causality \nas suggested by Bertrand Russell \nfollowing the sceptical philosophy of David Hume is\n not a remedy \nin the hope that science has absorbed all philosophy\n \n(Russell, 1945)\n, \n(Rasmussen, et al., 1994)\n.  This \nidea \nis \nevidenced from the writings \nof Nobel\n Laureate Albert Einstein, aut\nhor of relativity theories\n,\n who \nurged us to consider\n the role of causal reasoning in scientific \nexplanations\n. An illustration of causal reasoning \nstated \nby Albert Einstein \nis given. B\ny means of comparison of steam arising from water boiling in a pan heated\n on a gas stove \nwith a steam not arising from the adjacent pan \nnot lit\n, Albert Einstein argued that heat is the cause for the effect of steam arising\n from the pan\n(\npp\n72)\n \n(Einstein, 1920)\n. \n&#xa0;\nM\nost of us do not take into account \nLorentz transforma\ntions when computing distances i\ns suggested by\n Nobel Laureate Albert Einstein. Nor do we \ntake into account statistical \nand causal \nbase rates when computing risk i\ns suggested by\n Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman. From these observations\n made \nby Albert Einstein (1920) and\n \nDaniel Kahneman (1974\n),\n \nauthor concludes \nfrom the foregoing \ndiscussions \nthat there is \na strong demand to be aware of biases (or thumb rules) presents\n in \nour \nown intuitions\n and distort judgement(s) or decision(s)\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe text in this sec\ntion presents the hazard model in the form of \nHAZOP, EBTA and MORT worksheets in tabular form to represent the hazard faced by a cyclist\n, its causes and consequences \nas a desktop study\n. \nTable 1: Hypothetical Partial HAZOP study (Operating and Support Hazop Study) Drawing Number\nTransport for London Bow Roundabout Consultation Map \nhttps://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/corporate/Bow_Roundabout.pdf\nSystem \nEarly Start Traffic Light System ( ESTLS)\nAnalyst \nSanjeev Appicharla dated 06 Jan 2014 \nOperator Task \nProceed A11 side to West bound roundabout \nDesign intent\nSegregate cyclist and motorised traffic by delaying motorised traffic \nNo Item Function/purpose Parameter /purpose Guide word Conseque-nce Cause Recommendation Action1\nESTLS\nShow proceed \naspect to cyclist\n relative to proceed aspect to the motorised vehicles\nDisplay Green\nNo \nCyclist may mis-interpret dark aspect as failure of lamp proceeds\n to colli\nsion area.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n-Human error\n in operations \n-Circuit has failed\n-Lamp may have failed \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n-Signs \non the \nAdvanced Stop Line --- \nimprove  circuit reliability \n-Transport for London \n&#xa0;\n2\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nESTLS\n-ditto-\n-ditto-\nLess\nCyclist may mis-interpret dim aspect as failure of lamp proceeds to collision area.\n&#xa0;\n-Human error in operation \n- sunlight dimming the light intensity \n-fog and rain condition(s)\n- Signs on the ASL\n&#xa0;\n-sun screens if needed\n- lamp design \n-Transport for London \n&#xa0;\n3\nESTLS\n-ditto-\n-ditto-\nReverse\n-\nDisplays Green \nwhen \nMotorised traffic is signalled to \nMove into \ncollision area\n&#xa0;\n-cyclist may move into collision area\n-human error in ESTLS logic \n- \ntiming error in \nESTLS logic\n- human error in SCOOT logic\n-Design review \nfor Scoot Logic as well as ESTLS logic\n-Transport for London\n4\nESTLS\n-ditto-\n-ditto-\nEarly \nDispla\nys Green when \nMotorised traffic is signalled to \nMove into collision area or cyclist is struck behind vehicles \n&#xa0;\n-cyclist may move into collision area\n-human error in ESTLS logic \n- timing error in ESTLS logic\n&#xa0;\n- human error in requirements specification \n&#xa0;\n- collision may occur beyond CS2 area as motorised traffic may have accelerated\n-Design review\n-Transport for London\nNote: \n1. \nCollision area is any area beyond as designated CS2.  \n2.

Use of such above tables without a s\nafety management expert supervision is not recommended. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Tab\nle 1 shows that human (\nlatent failures) committed by various stakeholder\n(s) organisations \ndominate\n the rare and bad event of a cyclist accidental death. \nThe stakeholder organisations range f\nrom the legislative \n(\ncentral and local\n) assemblies, academic,\n research \nand supply \norganisations who advise the departments within the statutory transport organisations, and organisations investigating road accidents\n as well\n.  \nFrom the partial HAZOP study i\nt can be inferred that accelerating motorised traffic relative to cyclist is an occupational hazard. \nBecause in a relative (from Albert \nEinstein’s perspective)\n \nuniverse, \ninertial path is longer\n than accelerated path\n or in geometric terms, the diagonal of a\n triangle is less than \nsum of it sides is shown by Sir Roger Penrose\n \n(Penrose, 2004)\n. \n&#xa0;\nHaving established the fact that the Traffic Light System can induce errors and contribute a collision hazard, it is necessary to pay atten\ntion to the barriers that can prevent and protect the cyclist from this occupation hazard. \nPedestrians are also killed due to error in the specification of traffic light systems. \nA road user may be presented with a green aspect and motorised traffic with a\n flashing amber aspect thus giving rise to an opportunity for an accelerating motor traffic   to collide with a pedestrian. This aspect is usually ignored by safety researchers. For\n example\n, a study of Transport for London on Pedestrian Safety completely \nignored \nrole of traffic lights and focused on behavioural aspects and measures to remedy the behaviour. \n&#xa0;\nTable 2: Energy Barrier Trace Analysis Model (EBTA) Hazard ( Energy trigger) \nVictim \nBarrier\n \n( preventive as well as protective ) \nCollision hazard between a cyclist and a road vehicle \nLoss of life of a cyclist \nControl of traffic movements streams by traffic engineering without creating conflicts LTA\nTruck driver vision enhanced by Fresnel \nlens LTA\nEarly start traffic light system LTA\nGeneration of collision(hazard)  scenarios during the scheme planning stages LTA \nSpecification of Traffic light schemes LTA \nAccident Investigation techniques LTA \nRepresentations to generate and capture hazard scenarios LTA \nComprehension of systemic causal factors LTA \nUse of radar to raise awareness of presence of heavy vehicles LTA \nHGV Ban LTA \nSky cycle\n LTA\n&#xa0;\nThe role of above barriers \nis\n studied by the application of Management Oversight and Risk Tree. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTable 3: Management Oversight and Risk Tree TableThe \ntext in this section presents the MORT view of the accident. \nMORT Branch Description \nProblem Statement \nEvidence \nSpecific Control Factors\n( Engineering Branch)\n LTA\nSA1: Description of Accident: At 08:45 AM GMT at Bow Roundabout on 13\nth\n November 2013, \nVenera Minakhmetova\n, 24 was struck by a lorry and killed instantly\nBBC \nWeb \nNews report dated 2013\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-24925390\n&#xa0;\nSA2: Stabilisation and Recovery:\nThere \nwas no scope to afford medical help\nMetro London News report \nhttp://metro.co.uk/2013/11/13/four-london-cyclists-killed-in-eight-days-4185374/\n&#xa0;\nSD1 Technical Information System LTA\n \nSD1.b1.

In others words, it assumes that whole of motorised traffic movement at Bow Roundabout in their nature acts per classical Newton’s mechanics law that particles sufficiently removed in distance continue to move uniformly in a straight line(pp71)\n \n(Einstein, 1920)\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSD1 Technical Information System LTAd5.

Further lessons learnt have led to improving the traffic light timings to allow more time for cyclists to get across the roundabout. Additionally, with the provision of d\nedicated cycle lanes and a cycle bus stop bypass on approach to the roundabout, cyclists will be able to avoid standing traffic, providing improved journey times\n&#xa0;\nhttp://lcc.org.uk/uploads/4713\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nhttp://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/businessandpartners/lcds_chapter2.pdf\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nMgmt.

Both of these methods are described in freely available online publication\n \n(Appicharla, 2012)\n,\n \n(A.G.Hessami, 2012)\n. \n \n&#xa0;\nThe third information item\n on page \n3\n may be surprising to \nan \nunfamiliar reader\n. \n However, those who are conversant with the works of Dr Ashby work on Cybernetics know that information conveyed by a traffic light with a cycle symbol display contains a variety of messages\n \n(Ashby, 1957)\n.  The meanings assigne\nd to the elements of the set of messages Red, Amber, and Green such as Stop, Caution and Go may appear unambiguous to the reader but physically these messages introduce ambiguity. There are cyclic transitions between aspects from Red to Red-Yellow, Yellow \nto Green and Green-Yellow –Red to command stopped traffic to move and command a flowing traffic to a halt. Out of probable nine states (lit, unlit and failed state and ignoring the transitions pointed out earlier) only five are utilised by the road user to\n infer. In other words, a fraction of 5/8= .625 fraction of the probable states \nfrom user perspective \nis useful. Thus, the quantity of information used by a user of the traffic light system is only 62.5% and the rest 37.5% are don’t care situations. Apart \nfrom this, the specification of the twin traffic lights systems assumes a mathematical Cartesian Framework of Co-ordinate system in infrastructure planning and delivery:  the eastbound cyclist has an early start and therefore will not be in conflict with t\nhe left turning vehicles. \nIt is hard to imagine the role of non-Euclidean frameworks of Geometry in daily modern work life.  \n&#xa0;\nReactions to the Bow Roundabout accident by various stakeholders reported in the general press varied depending upon their roles:\n cyclist\n, lorry driver, commissioner of transport or CEO of a charitable organisation\n, and the Mayor of London. Cyclist Commissioner,\n \nAndrew Gilligan, took a  \npessimistic view that designing out hazards is not feasible\n \n(BBC New\ns, 2013)\n. The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, as a knee jerk reaction promised to invest one billion UK pounds of funds over next ten years to improve safety of the cyclists and appears to be sharing the same view advanced by\n \nAndrew Gilligan by admitt\ning the idea that no traffic engineer in the world can imagine every eventuality that can occur on the road\n. \n&#xa0;\nAuthor does not consider the proposition of how person A can harm person B unintentionally at a road junction cannot be imagined by a group of t\nraffic engineers, given the past history of such occurrences. However, author considers it is realistic to consider the idea that traffic engineers may be impaired in their ability to plan for safety improvements without giving rise to unintended effects. \n Because they may be under cognitive stress to balance safety risk concerns against a legal and cost decision criterion and thus\n,\n may be biased in their approach to hazards management. \nAuthor notes that Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman argued successfully t\nhat there is no such thing as cost efficient risk management criteria when moral intuitions are taken into account\n \n(Kahneman, 2011)\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSafety and the avoidance of risk \nare major concerns in any \nengineering\n activity\n.\n For more details on various interpretations of the word, risk, readers may wish to consult the paper hosted on the Stanford University Website\n \n(Hansson, 2011)\n. There is an extensive discussion on \nthe epistemological understand\ning and deﬁnition of risk\n in a paper published by \nCatherine E. Althaus\n in 2005\n \n(Althaus, 2005)\n.\n \nCatherine E. Althaus\n argued in her 2005 paper that \nstory of history about\n risk may be dating back 3102 BCE\n and other ancient civilisations\n. \nFrom a hindsight perspective, author infers that the \nchanting of peace mantras by the sages of the Upanishads indicates awareness of concept of harm \nand peace on their part \ndating back to 3000 BCE as per some historians\n o\nf ancient India\n \n(Valerie, 2003)\n. \nThus, author does not feel that there are \nany \nnovel ideas about risk assessment and\n \nmanagement\n \nof sources of harm (hazards) \nin this submission. \n  \nFrom a human error (Swiss Cheese Model) perspe\nctive, active errors are errors whose effects are felt immediately and latent errors are whose effects lay dormant for a time period\n. Human error experts acknowledge the idea that Management Oversight ad Risk Tree is a technique that can be used for organ\nisational analysis and safety studies in the published literature and on Wikipedia database\n \n(Rasmussen, et al., 1994)\n.  \nBased upon the reading of the foregoing philosophical and psychological papers  author is of the p\nrofessional opinion that every accident can be prevented: blaming the active human errors on the part of the cyclist and/or truck driver involved in the accident, and/or defending the latent human error on the part of traffic engineer and managers, and/or \nentertaining the naïve hope of raising awareness on the part of the cyclist or the heavy vehicle (lorry or bus driver) through technology, and/or accepting the theological position that such events are all acts of God \n \nis no solution to the problem faced b\ny the cyclist. Because cyclist accidental death arises from known physical, situational and cognitive factors and these factors may be managed through application of right resources: prioritising safety is absolutely necessary when using information contro\nl systems via modern technology that can unintentionally release harmful energy. An instance where these facts go recognised familiar to the author is drawn from the railway transport domain. Besides author, German academic aviation researchers and DB rail\nways are not convinced of the ability of the new European automatic train control system, ETCS, in averting hypothetical collisions between trains\n \n(Appicharla, 2013)\n. An IEEE paper published by Armin Zimmermann and G\nunter Homm\nel\n of Technical Berlin University in 2003 observed that probability of trains braking under GSM-R radio based automatic train control system operating in moving block system is 94% for the time deadline of 6 seconds, braking distance of 4500 metres, length\n of 410 metres. The probability worsens with increase of time deadline and braking distance\n. Thus, positive safety performance of ETCS can be regarded as doubtful. Further, this conviction finds support in the case of metro train control system failures a\ns well. The cancellation of Bombardier’s Signalling Contract by Transport for London is \na \nevidence\n in support of the assertion made\n. \nDespite the contrary and relevant evidence from three sources, the European Railway Agency and GB Railway Industry organi\nsations consider promoting the European Train Control System (ETCS) as a \nsatisficing\n strategy. \nDeveloping a common safety regulating strategy to promote ETCS as a standard automatic train control system is the main focus of managerial attention at this p\noint of time. Author agrees to the idea that German aviation\n and DB railway \nresearchers were right in drawing their readers’ attention to the inherent weakness in the ETCS technology. But German aviation researchers have not considered the contribution of \nlatent human errors in the specification of the TCAS device in 2002 accident prior to thinking about the solution to the problem of rail and/or road accident situations\n.  Apart from the sources cited, author \nhas \nlearnt that practitioners in the safety cri\ntical railway domain suffer from lack of awareness of Systems Thinking Approach to Safety as well. This inference is drawn from reading Ali Hessami’s work on safety assurance approach \n(A.G.Hessami, 2012)\n. Ali Hessami is the mai\nn author of the Yellow Book and CENELEC railway specific safety standards used by Network Rail, ORR, RSSB, ATOC and Transport for London Railway Organisations for safety assurance.  Ali Hessami follows the traditional methods of safety assurance assuming t\nhe equation user error equals human error. In his previous role of Head of System Safety, Ali Hessami promoted the Yellow Book for Engineering Safety Management methods. \nThe utility of application of Yellow Book type or fault and event tree modelling proce\nss for supporting safety critical decisions is learnt from the example as these procedures cannot be used for modelling fallible decisions that shape the performance of operators or users of electrical/programmable/ software electronic control systems. \nJa\nmes Reason (1990) observed that failure types that originate at the management layers and take the shape of fallible decisions and finding ways to neutralising these the major challenge facing human factor researchers with preserving the safety of complex,\n high risk systems. This Submission has shown how the fallible decisions\n when implemented that pose danger to \na cyclist\n \nfrom a particular example of Bow Roundabout Accident \ncan be revealed \nwithout conducting \ndeep mathematical and \npsychological research. \nAu\nthor has noted that risk can be approached in several ways and has made efforts to include all the perspectives into the accident modelling and analysis. \n2\n&#xa0;\n More details can be accessed from the URL\n:\n \nhttp://beta.tfl.gov.uk/travel-information/improvements-and-projects/bow-roundabout\n More details can be acc\nessed from the URL:\n \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_of_operations\n More details can be accessed from the URL: \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-24925390\n More details can be accessed from the URL\n:\n \nhttp://www.hse.gov.uk/research/rrpdf/rr941.pdf\n More details can be accessed from the URL: \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk\n More details can be accessed from the URL: \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-24989985\n. \n \nM\nore details can be accessed from the URL: \nhttp://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs317/en/\n \nMore details can be accessed from the URL: \n \nhttp://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/corporate\n/cycling/cycle-safety-action-plan.pdf\n \nMore details can be accessed from the URL\n \nhttp://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/Factors-Influencing-pedestrian-safety-literature-review.pdf\n \nMore details can be accessed from the URL: \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24998730\n \nMore details can be accessed from the URL: \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-25549789\n More details can be seen at this url: \nhttp://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2000/kilby-lecture.pdf\n More details can be accessed from the URL: \nhttp://www.economist.com/node/2155\n3497\n More details can be accessed from the URL\n:\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24930598\n More details can be accessed from the URL: \nhttp://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/14/london-cycling-death-toll-is-utterly-intolerable\n More details can be accessed from the URL:  \nhttp://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/20/london-cyclist-deaths-panic-change-wont-work\n More details can be accessed from the URL\n:\nhttp://www\n.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24930598\n More details can be accessed from the URL: \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_India\n More details can be accessed from the URL: \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_India\n More details can be accessed from the URL: \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_cheese_\nmodel\n More details can be accessed from the URL\n \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_error\n More details can be accessed from the URL: \nhttp://elib.dlr.de/48880/1/Rico07Comparison.pdf\n More details can be accessed from the URL: \nhttp://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=1213234\n More de\ntails can be accessed from the URL:\n \nhttp://www.railjournal.com/index.php/financial/london-underground-and-bombar\ndier-abandon-tube-signalling-contract.html?channel=532\n Satisficing is a term introduced by Nobel Laureate Herbert A.Simon to denote tendencies displayed by organisations to pick up the first alternative to meet the decision criteria.
