"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from East Riding of Yorkshire Council (TIC 058)1.1.\n&#xa0; \nThe main objective of this paper is to assert what criteria should be the foundations of a rural public transport network that is able to resolve many of the accessibility and social issues facing the rural population. This resea\nrch is not looking at finding a design solution for public transport networks, but is seeking to be able to construct a network founded on policy principles. A secondary purpose is to identify any differences between a rural transport network that has deve\nloped over time and is based on passenger data against a theoretical transport network that has routes based on research and academic literature.\n1.2.\n&#xa0; \nThe methodology used identifies the demand for public transport by residents (Origins) for accessing key servi\nces (Destinations). Once this is established, two different methods (Scenario 1 and 2) are used to connect people to places. In Scenario 1, GIS Mapping software is used to create a rural public transport network which can be compared to the existing transp\nort network and analysis made. Scenario 2 seeks to highlight key connections and interchanges across the East Riding network as opposed to specific routes.\n1.3.\n&#xa0; \nThe research concluded that five key services: Health, Education, Leisure, Shopping, and Employment,\n should be accessible to all residents. The key public transport users were classed as: Elderly, Rural dwellers, Non-car owners, People with disabilities, Low income, Commuters, Tourists, Students, and Ethnic minorities. These user groups that rely upon pu\nblic transport to access key services are often referred to as ‘transport disadvantaged’.\n1.4.\n&#xa0; \nThe results show a gap between the social and accessibility needs of the rural population and what public transport service is currently available. However, there are\n also some similarities in routes between the theoretical and existing network which would suggest that policy principles could be used to inform network design.\n1.5.\n&#xa0; \nThis research can act as a knowledge base upon which Local Authorities can apply a similar met\nhod to establish where a current public transport network is meeting the accessibility needs of a population and where it is failing to do so. In the East Riding, it is hoped that it will be used as a tool for making recommendations on where supported bus \nservices should be maintained or reviewed to ensure that public transport is made available and accessible to the most vulnerable users in society.\n&#xa0;2.1.\n&#xa0; \nThe design of rural public transport networks is an area of transport planning with little r\nesearch and so this paper addresses some of the main issues involved in this, as well as offering a new method of designing a rural network based on accessibility. The difficulties that the rural population face in accessing services is seemingly understoo\nd, with much literature on accessibility, social exclusion and demand responsive transport services. However, there is no research into whether existing networks respond to, or a network could be based upon, these key rural issues. Perhaps one of the main \nreasons for this is that most areas already have an existing public transport network and therefore the opportunity to design a public transport network from scratch is unusual. This paper intends to do exactly that, and investigate whether public transpor\nt networks in rural areas could be created in response to the accessibility needs of a rural population.\n2.2.\n&#xa0; \nThis paper is partly a response to the increasing pressure placed on local authorities and bus operators in rural areas who are challenged with maintai\nning a public transport network in an unsettled economy. In many cases, rural public transport services are not commercially viable and are not an attractive option for private bus companies. However, the importance of providing certain bus routes is funda\nmental to local communities and wider society. Local authorities often acknowledge this ‘socio-economic’ need by subsidising selected non-commercial services so that bus operators are still willing operate services. Unfortunately, in light of recent reduct\nions in funding from central government to local government these services are under threat. The withdrawal of public transport services – often in areas of low patronage and therefore high rurality – can have a marked effect on the livelihood of residents\n who rely upon such transport to access key services such as doctor’s surgeries and shopping centres. With the concept of ‘accessibility’ being so highly regarded, it felt appropriate that any design of a rural transport network should incorporate this as \na fundamental ingredient in its planning. This paper addresses this issue by analysing what a public transport network would look like if it were to provide for its residents based purely on an accessibility case.\n2.3.\n&#xa0; \nThis paper starts with a review of the lit\nerature looking at the main issues of rural transport, and network design, before examining the topics of transport accessibility and social exclusion. It will then outline the key role that public transport networks play in connecting users to services. T\nhis is followed by consideration of how a rural transport network can be created based on the needs and accessibility requirements of different user groups from a rural population. This will include a description of the research methodology with an explana\ntion of how this is used to create a theoretical public transport map in the East Riding. The results of the public transport map are then presented using GIS software and maps to demonstrate network coverage and accessibility. The paper draws to a close b\ny comparing the existing public transport provision to the proposed public transport map and makes a number of suggestions for improving accessibility across the region. Finally, the conclusion offers a way forward for researchers and professionals attempt\ning to combat the issue of social exclusion and accessibility in rural areas. It will also suggest an alternative method of designing a public transport network in the East Riding that focuses on policy objectives and social need as opposed to passenger nu\nmbers and commercial growth.\n2.4.\n&#xa0; \nThe main objective of this research is to assert the criteria that should be the foundations of a rural public transport network that is able to resolve many of the accessibility and social issues facing people who live in rura\nl areas. This dissertation is not looking at finding a design solution for public transport networks, but is seeking to be able to construct a network founded on policy principles.\n \nA secondary purpose of the dissertation is to identify any differences betw\neen a rural transport network that has been established over time and is based on actual passenger data and historical routes against a theory based transport network that creates routes based on research and academic literature.\n2.5.\n&#xa0; \nThe research will also \nseek to act as guidance for rural transport authorities who are in the process of addressing these tricky issues alongside budget cuts and a need to provide a quality public transport service across a sparsely populated network. Hopefully, the information \ncontained in this paper can be used as a research base for making decisions on how to redesign public transport networks to address accessibility to services in rural areas.\n3.1.\n&#xa0; \nThe methodology I will be using to connect demand to services applies \nan Origin and Destination concept in order to create a series of lines on a map (Routes) which connect areas of residents (Origins) to a service such as a school, doctors, retail park etc. (Destinations).  \nThe previous chapters provide detailed research in\nto the level of demand that could be expected for a public transport network in the East Riding area. Using this information as well as micro data, it is possible to draw conclusions as to where public transport routes would be best placed to serve the pub\nlic need.\n \nTable \n4\n MOSAIC segments regarded as potential users of a public transport network\nSegment\nNo. HH\n% HH\nCharacteristics\nMedical\nEducation\nLeisure\nOffices\nIndustrial\nRetail\nA4,993\n3.0\nElderly pensioners, very low income, \npoor health, prefer face-to-face contact\n\n\n\n-\n\n-\n-\n\n\nB7,673\n4.7\nLow income families and single parents, high unemployment, poorly educated, poor diet heavy smokers, receptive to face to face contact,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC17,296\n10.6\nYoung working class, \nsome unemployment, poorly educated, poor diet likely to smoke\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD21,086\n12.9\nOlder people, small villages and rural areas, cars important, varying levels of income\n\n\n-\n\n-\n-\n\n\nF9,788\n6.0\nOlder workers and pensioners, low to middle \nincomes, prefer face to face contact\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG6,780\n4.1\nOlder workers and pensioners, low income, likely to smoke and don’t exercise, prefer face to face contact\n\n\n\n-\n-\n\n\n\n\n\nTOTAL67,616\n41%\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSOURCE: Work by the Author - Importance of accessing key service: rating from \n\n\n\n (very important) to - (least important)\n&#xa0;\n3.2.\n&#xa0; \nMosaic UK (2012) is a research tool that ‘provides an accurate understanding of the demographics, lifestyles and behaviour of all ind\nividuals and households in the UK’. By utilizing this information alongside other population research, individual households can be categorized as potential public transport passengers. Using this customer insight information the East Riding demographic is\n divided \nup into 11 different segments (Segments A – L) that each represent a lifestyle and describe the user group by their potential service needs, communication methods and other specific characteristics such as age, income levels etc. In the East Ridin\ng there are approximately 163,906 households (HH) in the East Riding, and these all have MOSAIC data attached which categorise the residents in that household. \n3.3.\n&#xa0; \nTable 4 identifies six segments that are deemed as being potential users of a public transport \nnetwork based on a set of accessibility criteria. Each of these segments is regarded as having a heightened need to access specific services based on their set of characteristics. For example, the assumption that Segment G smokes, doesn’t exercise and is p\nrimarily an older demographic is likely to result in a high need for access to medical provision. It should be noted that these are assumptions being made on the information provided by the MOSAIC data and other information gathered on these specific user \ngroups throughout the course of this research.\n3.4.\n&#xa0; \nOne of the aims of this research is to enable disadvantaged user groups to access key services in the East Riding using methods that focus on social need. Two different scenarios will be tested to determine wh\nat level of public transport network would be useful in order to improve accessibility in the region. Scenario 1 uses existing bus stops to connect residents to their destinations, whereas Scenario 2 ignores the existing infrastructure and proposes a netwo\nrk solely based on the locations of residents and key services regardless of their proximity to bus stops. By combining two different approaches the final network proposal will be more robust and acknowledge the distinction between a totally fresh network,\n and one that can be based on existing infrastructure. \n3.5.\n&#xa0; \nThis scenario uses existing bus stop service infrastructure to connect residents to their destinations. Public transport routes are not usually able to deliver passengers from their home \ndoor to the door of Tesco, or a medical surgery, and some level of walking is expected.\n3.6.\n&#xa0; \nIt is commonly assumed that a ‘walkable catchment area is an easy walk for the average person’, and so in this particular instance, a 400m walking distance has been use\nd as a proxy for a ‘walkable distance’, and is applied to residents’ proximity to both bus stops and services (ie. Doctor’s surgery) (Chung 2012). This 400m walking distance is therefore appropriate for estimating the catchment of potential public transpor\nt passengers. In turn, when getting off the transport at the destination, 400m is an acceptable distance to walk to access the service. Whilst these distances can change depending on the quality of public transport and services available, they will be used\n for the purpose of this study as a default distance.\n&#xa0;\nThe first step is to identify the number of users that are within 400m of key services as the assumption is made that most of these passengers will not require transport to access these services. This \ngroup is named \n‘walking’.\n&#xa0;\nFurther to this, we apply a 400m distance buffer around every public bus stop in the East Riding to calculate the number of residents that are within a 400m distance of a bus stop. These residents are regarded as potential public transport passengers, and \nare the main target group \nfor the public transport network. This group is named \n‘public transport’&#xa0;\nThe final group is named \n‘isolated’ as they are not within walking distance of key services, nor within walking distance of a bus stop. It is still essentia\nl for these users to reach services, but the mode of conventional public transport services is not deemed appropriate and so alternative methods such as Demand-Responsive-Transport should be considered to plug this accessibility gap. \n&#xa0;\nTable \n5\n MOSAIC population by service and access\n&#xa0;Medical\nEducation\nLeisure\nOffices\nIndustrial\nRetail\nPublic Transport\n28,965\n2,891\n11,408\n6,463\n5,316\n5,316\nIsolated\n11,659\n643\n5,304\n1,432\n1,099\n6,575\nWalking\n26,992\n9,132\n44,124\n33,642\n34,105\n55,725\nSOURCE: Work by the Author\n3.7.\n&#xa0; \nUsing the research population we can then begin to establish various routes which link the residents to a specific service. Arcview GIS Software Network Analyst was used to calculate routes that connected bus stops within 400m o\nf passengers to bus stops within 400m of a service, opting for the closest facilities. This method was carried out for each of the particular segments that required a service (ie. Education must have access to Segments B and C). In turn, this created a ser\nies of routes on the East Riding map that, when combined together, form a network of accessibility for residents to access their nearest service. Replicating this approach across all six services, and then overlaying the information enables the identificat\nion of where routes are most needed. For the purpose of the paper, this process will be demonstrated using the medical provision only (further information on other services is available in the Appendices).\nTable \n6\n Number of households requiring access to medical provision\nImportant to User Group\nWalkable\nPublic TransportIsolated\nA\n3,268\n1,68243\nB\n3,927\n3,327419\nC\n11,527\n4,914855\nD\n1,208\n10,7879,091\nF\n3,812\n4,977999\nG\n3,250\n3,278252\nTOTAL\n26,992\n28,96511,659\nSOURCE: Work by the Author\n3.8.\n&#xa0; \nAccess to medical services is a fundamental need of all residents, and each of the 6 segments identified in Table 6 require access to some level of medical provision. This is the largest of the six individual service \nnetworks demonstrating that almost 30,000 households are heavily reliant on public transport to access medical services in the East Riding. Figure 20 shows where the main routes would be required in the network to provide an adequate network for serving me\ndical establishments:\nFigure \n20\n Scenario 1 – proposed network for medical services\nSOURCE: Work of the Author\n3.9.\n&#xa0; \nBy repeating this process for all the difference services, and then combining the information, a network that provides access to the range of different services can be establish\ned. The gaps present in this network could be filled by alternative modes of transport such as Community Transport Operators and Dial-a-Ride services. The blue, green and purple lines are particularly important to the network as these segments of road conn\nect residents to different services, and if a bus route was put onto this section then it would fulfil the accessibility needs for various different user groups to different key services. The yellow lines indicate where a route is required in order to tran\nsport residents to one specific key service. In conjunction with the colour importance grading of each of these route sections, it is also important to consider other aspects of the transport network such as major settlement locations, estimated population\ns and potential ridership levels. \nFigure \n21\n Scenario 1 – proposed network in Haltemprice area\nSOURCE: Work of the Author\n3.10.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFigure 21 focuses on the Haltemprice area which is identified as one of the top 3 key areas where a bus network would provide access \nfor residents to key services. \nThere is a strong need for multi-service routes running through Cottingham, Kirkella and Anl\naby and into Willerby, as well as a lower level of support in Hessle.  The two blue road sections present on the map, particularly the road in \nCottingham, demonstrate where a bus service would be used by residents accessing all 6 different key services and\n would therefore be highly recommended as a potential public transport route. The South Holderness has already been identified as an area of high rurality and deprivation on a number of different levels from income to car ownership and this is mirrored in \nthe routes that Scenario 1 has identified. The routes from Keyingham to Withernsea along the A1033, and towards Easington on the B1433 are heavily populated with routes of more than 3 different services. There is also a strong case for providing public tra\nnsport to the West of Keyingham towards Thorngumbald and Hedon, especially given the sparse nature of the region. Figure 22 clearly identifies issues that residents living in Roos, Burton Pidsea, Burstwick, Sproatley, Bilton and Preston will have accessing\n key services.\nFigure \n22\n Scenario 1 – proposed network in South Holderness area\nSOURCE: Work of the Author\n3.11.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe area of Goole in the South East of the East Riding is identified as requiring public transport. Most notable is the isolation of Adlingfleet (South East) in relation to key services, depicted by the long blue, green and purple lines that connect it wit\nh Goole. There is also a need for public transport from the south of Hook into Goole. Outside the town centre, there is a transport corridor stretching between Gilberdyke in the East to Howden in the West. \nFigure \n23\n Scenario 1 – proposed network in Goole area\nSOURCE: Work of the Author\n3.12.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDespite not being a full six service route section, the distance of the section and presence of 4/5 service sections would suggest a need for public transport. The sm\naller settlements of Pollington, West and East Cowick, and Rawcliiffe are regarded as areas where public transport usage would be high \namongst residents. The network providing access for residents to all services is made up of each service specific network\n and therefore shows any similarities in where bus routes could be used to connect people to more than one service (See Figure 24)\n&#xa0;\nFigure \n24\n Scenario 1 – network of potential routes connecting residents to key services\nSOURCE: W\nork of the Author\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
