[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Tobacco is a lethal childhood addiction[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Tobacco use is a huge drain on the economy[bold]&#xa0;
[normal](a)
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]NHS costs of £2.7 billion
[normal](b)
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Loss of productivity from smoking breaks of £2.9 billion
[normal](c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Increased absenteeism of £2.5 billion
[normal](d)
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The cost of clearing up cigarette butts of £342 million
[normal](e)
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The cost of smoking-related house fires of £507 million
[normal](f)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Loss in economic output from the deaths of
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]I[bold]llicit tobacco[bold], along with all tobacco,[bold] is a concern[bold]&#xa0;
[normal](a)
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Price is the most effective policy lever to reduce tobacco consumption,
[normal] with increased prices incentivising smokers to cut down or quit
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]I
[normal]llicit tobacco is 
[normal]available at half the price of licit products
[normal], 
[normal]encouraging 
[normal]smokers 
[normal]to smoke 
[normal]more than if they were paying full price
[normal], keeping them hooked on a lethal addiction
[normal].
[normal]  And while tobacco companies 
[normal]blame 
[normal]HM Treasury for increasing tobacco prices through taxation, latest research 
[normal]shows 
[normal]that tobacco companies themselves are responsible for half of all price increases
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](b)
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Illicit tobacco is available from a range of accessible sources – pubs, shops, private houses (
[normal]sometimes 
[normal]known ‘tab houses’
[normal] or ‘fag houses’
[normal]), street markets and 
[normal]ice cream vans.  
[normal]Through this, n
[normal]ot only are adult smokers presented with increased opportunities to buy, but children can 
[normal]also 
[normal]access it without 
[normal]the protection of 
[normal]regulatory measures including age of sale legislation and mandated graphic pictorial warnings, 
[normal]allowing illicit tobacco sellers to hook children onto a lethal addiction.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is also known, as noted by the scope of the inquiry, that the illicit tobacco trade is linked 
[normal]to crime, from low-level offending in communities to organised crime regionally, nationally and internationally.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](d)
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The tobacco industry have also historically been involved in the illicit tobacco trade and have been forced to sign legally binding and enforceable agreements with the European Union to compensate for this involvement and to prevent their products from falling into the hands of criminals
[normal].  Japan Tobacco International 
[normal]is 
[normal]currently being investigated by OLAF, the EU anti-fraud office, over alleged 
[normal]tobacco smuggling 
[normal]links
[normal] 
[normal]to the Assad regime in Syria
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](e)
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The illicit tobacco trade costs the UK tax payer around £1.8 billion in lost revenue
[normal] every year
[normal], which could be spent on hospitals, schools and other vital public services. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The illicit tobacco market is declining[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The North East
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](a)
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The proportion of smokers buying illicit tobacco has red
[normal]uced from 24% to 17% since 2009
[normal](b)
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he overall volume of illicit tobacco is down by 39%, to represent 9% of the region’s estimated total tobacco consumption
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The South West
[normal](a)
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]the proportion of smokers buying illicit tobacco reduced fr
[normal]om 20% in 2010 to 16% in 2013
[normal](b)
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The illicit market share as a percentage of all tobacco consumed reduced from 11% in 2010 to 7% in 2013
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The North West
[normal](a)
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]A reduction in the number of young people who have bought cigarettes from sellers such as neighbours, car boots and ice-cream vans 
[normal]from 42% in 2011 to 27% in 2013
[normal](b)
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]A reduction in the number of young people who have 
[normal]bought fake cigarettes
[normal] down from 28% in 2011 to 22%
[normal] in 2013
[normal](c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A drop in figures were also seen in the number of single cigarettes bought
[normal] 
[normal]from 67% in 2011 to 49% in 2013.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The partnership is a case study of good practice[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]“The programme has had a measurable effect on the problem [of illicit tobacco] in the North of England.  It was the first programme to develop a comprehensive approach to tackling the demand for and the supply of illicit tobacco… The scheme is an exemplar of partnership working and should now be widely disseminated.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Tougher [bold]sanctions and penalties[bold] [bold]are needed [bold]for tobacco smuggling[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Penalties and sa[bold]n[bold]ctions must be directed higher up the supply chain[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]“Large quantities of UK hand rolling tobacco brands, which far outweigh legitimate demand, are being sold abroad. This is despite legislation introduced 7 years ago to crack down on tobacco manufacturers facilitating smuggling.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“One comes to the conclusion that you are either crooks or you are stupid, and you do not look very stupid.  How can you possibly have sold cigarettes 
[normal]to Latvia, Kaliningrad, Afghanistan and Moldova in the expectation that those were just going to be used by the indigenous population… and not in the expectation they would be smuggled?” 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is no evidence that standardised packaging will increase the [bold]size of the illicit tobacco market[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“As a retailer, I know that introducing plain, standardised tobacco packs into my shop will be very straightforward to implement and will have no impact on my existing customers or trade.
[normal]“There are already very low profit margins on a packet of cigarettes compared to other products within a store.  If a customer decides that today is the day they will quit smoking and, instead of paying nearly £6 for 20 cigarettes, opts to buy a packet of chewing gum for 49p – it’ll mean I’ll make 1p less profit and have a customer with £5.50 spare to spend on other products.”
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](a)
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]inadequate enforcement capability, rather than high tobacco prices, allow
[normal]s
[normal] the il
[normal]licit tobacco trade to flourish
[normal](b)[bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]the tobacco industry 
[normal]itself is 
[normal]responsible for half of the price increases on tobacco products, the other half resulting from increased taxation
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Standardised packaging will not affect the economy[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]“While the health impact of smoking is significant and too often tragic, there is also a considerable burden on the economy and local businesses.  For every pound spent on tobacco less than 10p stays in the local economy.  What is left is poor health, smaller incomes and greater dependency on the state.”
