defaultWritten evidence from Dr Carl Reynolds (GMC022)defaultI am a respiratory physician and an academic. I have previously written in the British Medical Journal[1][2] on the topic of conflict 
defaultof interest, am co-founder of Bad Guidelines, a successful campaign for guidance on interactions between healthcare professionals and the pharmaceutical industry to be evidence based[3], and part of a campaign for medical education accredited free from ind
defaultustry influence called Conflict Free Conferences[4].
defaultI am writing to draw attention to two areas where intervention from the GMC would be beneficial to both doctors and patients.
defaultConflict of interest and routine researchdefaultAs a physician I care deeply about 
defaultproviding the best treatment I can to my patients. In many areas of medicine establis
defaulthing what the best treatment 
defaultis hard in itself either because of an abundance of conflicting evidence or a lack of evidence altogether.
defaultUnfortunately, this is made even ha
defaultrder because a lack of means to track conflict of interest for health care professionals creates difficulty in identifying instances where educational and academic resources may be being deliberately biased to a commercial end. A register of doctors' confl
defaulticts of interest would make critical appraisal of such resources much easier.
defaultThe GMC may consider making part of register available, specifically the list of doctors names, specialties, and GMC numbers to allow others to keep track of these conflicts of i
defaultnterests in a similar way to existing websites such as 
defaultwww.theyworkforyou.com
default do for politicians.
defaultIt is a lost opportunity when the potential learning from situations where there is genuinely no evidence availa
defaultble that one treatment will be better than another is not captured through pragmatic randomised controlled trials or other means. The GMC should consider reinstating a recommendation to encourage such research[6]
defaultCreating a register for doctorsâ€™ conflicts 
defaultof interest and encouraging research in routine care would both bode well with the first of the GMC's duties of a doctor:
default"MAKE THE CARE OF YOUR PATIENT YOUR FIRST CONCERN; Protect and promote the health of patients and the public; Respect patients' right 
defaultto confidentiality; Never discriminate unfairly against patients or colleagues;"
defaultas well as Beauchamp and Childress's primary principle of medical ethics 
default"Respect for autonomy: respecting the decision-making capacities of autonomous persons; enabling indi
defaultviduals to make reasoned informed choices."
defaultand intervention here would be most welcome.
