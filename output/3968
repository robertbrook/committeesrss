[normal]Written evidence from Dr Carl Reynolds (GMC022)[bold]I am a respiratory physician and an academic. I have previously written in the British Medical Journal[1][2] on the topic of conflict 
[normal]of interest, am co-founder of Bad Guidelines, a successful campaign for guidance on interactions between healthcare professionals and the pharmaceutical industry to be evidence based[3], and part of a campaign for medical education accredited free from ind
[normal]ustry influence called Conflict Free Conferences[4].
[normal]I am writing to draw attention to two areas where intervention from the GMC would be beneficial to both doctors and patients.
[normal]Conflict of interest and routine research[bold]As a physician I care deeply about 
[normal]providing the best treatment I can to my patients. In many areas of medicine establis
[normal]hing what the best treatment 
[normal]is hard in itself either because of an abundance of conflicting evidence or a lack of evidence altogether.
[normal]Unfortunately, this is made even ha
[normal]rder because a lack of means to track conflict of interest for health care professionals creates difficulty in identifying instances where educational and academic resources may be being deliberately biased to a commercial end. A register of doctors' confl
[normal]icts of interest would make critical appraisal of such resources much easier.
[normal]The GMC may consider making part of register available, specifically the list of doctors names, specialties, and GMC numbers to allow others to keep track of these conflicts of i
[normal]nterests in a similar way to existing websites such as 
[normal]www.theyworkforyou.com
[normal] do for politicians.
[normal]It is a lost opportunity when the potential learning from situations where there is genuinely no evidence availa
[normal]ble that one treatment will be better than another is not captured through pragmatic randomised controlled trials or other means. The GMC should consider reinstating a recommendation to encourage such research[6]
[normal]Creating a register for doctorsâ€™ conflicts 
[normal]of interest and encouraging research in routine care would both bode well with the first of the GMC's duties of a doctor:
[normal]"MAKE THE CARE OF YOUR PATIENT YOUR FIRST CONCERN; Protect and promote the health of patients and the public; Respect patients' right 
[normal]to confidentiality; Never discriminate unfairly against patients or colleagues;"
[normal]as well as Beauchamp and Childress's primary principle of medical ethics 
[normal]"Respect for autonomy: respecting the decision-making capacities of autonomous persons; enabling indi
[normal]viduals to make reasoned informed choices."
[normal]and intervention here would be most welcome.
