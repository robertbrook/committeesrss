&#xa0;Supplementary written evidence from the Department for Transport (CYS0104)&#xa0;Thank you for giving me the opportunity to give evidence to the TransportCommittee on 4 December 2013. Whilst giving evidence I promised to provide additional information regarding safety evaluation of cycling schemes.&#xa0;The main source of information about road accidents and their causes comes from the details of accidents reported to the police which involve injury to at least one person- commonly known as STATS19 data. These reportscontain detailed information relating to:&#xa0;Annex A provides a full breakdown of cycling accident statistics based on2012 data. The data for this year will not be available until 2014.&#xa0;In line with the Localism agenda, the Government is reducing the burden of red tape and easing the burden of inspection and reporting back to central government. Through localism, the Department has reduced the need for local authorities to complete detailed reports on scheme monitoring and evaluation; instead allowing them to determine their requirements at a local level.&#xa0;However that is not to say there is not any monitoring or evaluation of how Government funds are spent. All cycling schemes that have been awarded funding will have been appraised at the bidding stage. Bids must demonstrate a package of monitoring and evaluation of their scheme to be eligible for funding.&#xa0;Recent bids assessed by the Department for Transport for cycling schemes, such as Cycle City Ambition Grants, Cycling in National Parks Grants and the Cycle Safety Fund all had a full business case appraisal completed prior to announcing funding.&#xa0;As part of the business case appraisal process, the impact of the scheme on casualties was investigated by departmental economists; this appraisal uses the statistics provided for current casualties and uses assumptions to understand how many accidents might be avoided by implementing the scheme.&#xa0;In addition, all bids are required through the standard business case appraisal process to identify how they intend to monitor and evaluate their programmes' activity. Bids are assessed to ensure the proposed monitoring and evaluation is both proportionate and appropriate to the scale of the scheme.&#xa0;Local authorities are best placed to understand the particular needs of their areas and to judge where schemes to improve safety will be most effective; therefore, much of the monitoring and evaluation occurs at a local level. Whilst there is no requirement to send the results into the Department, the results are there for the Department to use.&#xa0;The LSTF, which has cycling elements in 94 of its 96 projects, followed the same business case appraisal process as the Cycling Ambition Grants and the Cycle Safety Fund. As the LSTF represents £540 million of Department investment a wider monitoring and evaluation framework has been devised. The full framework can be found at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-sustainable-transoort-fund­ monitoring-and-evaluation-framework.&#xa0;The LSTF monitoring and evaluation framework contains three basic components:&#xa0;&#xa0;It is worth noting that the primary objectives for the LSTF were to improve the local economy and reduce carbon emissions through transport; therefore, the primary focus is not on cycle safety. However, there are likely to be some useful data that will come out of the LSTF project evaluation that will inform the implementation of cycling measures.&#xa0;Both the Cycle City Ambition and Cycling in National Parks grants required each local authority to monitor and evaluate their schemes. The main focus of the grants was to increase the number of people cycling, along side improving the local economy and improving health and wellbeing. There was no direct requirement to monitor cycle safety. However, some local authorities in their bids did specify their intention to monitor the schemes success on reducing cycle accidents, these included the three largest cities Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester, who received over £55 million of the £77 million funding, and Oxford. All the other cities and national parks who were successful are evaluating their schemes and it is hoped that they will include safety evaluation.&#xa0;The Cycle Safety Fund allocated £15 million for London and £20 million for the rest of the country. Transport for London is continually assessing and evaluating the safety of cycling and continues to work with the Department to find new and innovative ways to implement engineering solutions to improve safety.&#xa0;The Cycle Safety Fund for the rest of England is being administered by Sustrans. 81 schemes across England were selected to improve the design and layouts of dangerous junctions to enable better cycle safety. Sustrans will be evaluating the success of these schemes will be using accident data from central and local sources; in addition the perception of safety will be assessed. The evaluation has only just started and there will need to be an extended period to gather statistically significant evidence.&#xa0;Evaluating the effects of new and improved infrastructure on cycle safety needs to occur over a significant length of time to ensure the data is significant. As levels of cycling are currently relatively low, with a small number of accidents, it is more difficult to be sure that any changes in accidents rates are statistically significant.&#xa0;I hope you find the information I have supplied useful. I look forward to receiving your recommendations in due course.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[miles]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;Killed               KSI               All&#xa0;&#xa0;Contributory factors&#xa0;Details of factors contributing to injury accidents are recorded by the police. Whilst it is not possible to determine blame or even a definitive "cause" from these, they can offer some insight in common types of accident. An accident can have more than one contributory factor.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;According to 2012 data:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;We are aware that other organizations have undertaken research using contributory factor data, but also that there is rarely one single "answer" or "solution" arising from it.&#xa0;One such research project is being undertaken by Loughborough University for Transport for London. These studies have not been published. When published, the Department will ensure that any findings will be used to inform their cycling policies.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
