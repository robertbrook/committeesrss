"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Timothy Oldershaw Technical Director of J. Brand in a Personal Capacity and as Technical Director of J. Brand (BRC 51)&#xa0;\nIntroduction.My name is Tim Oldershaw, and I am the Technical Director of an electrical installation company based in London. I have been an electrician for 35 years and have seen the status of a “professional” been lowered and defused over the years in the UK. This ha\ns not happened across \nEurope, where a qualified electrician still has standing and legal requirements.\n I feel very \npassionate\n about safety and quality, as I believe these go hand in hand. There is nothing \nsadder\n than to hear that someone has been \nhurt\n or k\nilled by a sub\n-\nstandard\n electrical installation which should have been \npicked up and fixed by the correct implementation of testing and the basic good \npractise\n of the Standards (BS7671 \netc.\n).\n&#xa0;\nMy Relevant QualificationsJIB Approved Electrician City and Gui\nlds 236\nCity and Guilds 2372 Design, Installation and Testing of Photovoltaic Systems\nJIB RDDE (Registered Datacomms Design Engineer)\nChairman BSI  TCT/007/0-/02 Telecommunications; Installation requirements- Cabling installation and UK implementation has \non-going responsibility for the contents of BS EN 50174-2, BS EN 50174-3, BS EN 50310, BS6701 and BS 8492\nMember of BST TCT/007/0-/01 Telecommunications - Installation requirements - Cabling infrastructure, design, planning and commissioning has on-going r\nesponsibility for the contents of BS EN 50173 ISO 11801 and other European and International Standards.\n UK Principal Expert and Member of CLC TC215 WG2 which mirrors the work of the BSI TCT/007/0-/02 and inputs to the ISO and CENELEC\nMember of JPEL 64 Ad \nHoc WG534 which has ongoing responsibility for the protection against overvoltage of atmospheric origin or due to switching in IEE Wiring Regulation BS7671.\nMember of JPEL 64 Ad Hoc WG444 which has ongoing responsibility for Measures against electromagneti\nc influences in IEE Wiring Regulation BS7671.\n&#xa0;\nPart PWhen part P was announced I was very pleased and thought it would be as \nstrong\n as the “safe gas” installers system. As it was introduced it became clear it was \nnot,\n it was a \nwatered\n down \nlicencing\n syste\nm. But as it was rolled out and contractors began to join the ECA, NICEIC and other schemes \nit \nreally\n started to have an impact, with lots of one man bands, and small \ncompany’s\n joining and \nactually\n \ntesting\n \ninstallations\n in both the domestic and the commerc\nial area. We have also seen a \ngreat\n improvement in the awareness of specifiers and consumers to insist on a “Part P” registered installer and a registered certificate on completion.\n&#xa0;\nThe small installers have been dragged to the standards, by the new Part P\n, but when the have found them, they see that if all \ninstallers\n have to comply they are not put at a \nfinancial\n disadvantage, and are only \ntoo\n pleased to do quality, safe work.\n&#xa0;\nThe problem is still the rogue traders and DIY installers who love \nto quote the \n“\ncompetent\n person” quip, \n“I said I am \ncompetent\n there for I am a “\ncompetent\n person” and so I am \nlegally\n \nallowed\n to do electrical \ninstallations\n. \nI don’t\n need any \nexpensive\n \nqualifications;\n I have been to the school of life.”\n&#xa0;\nUnfortunately \nlegally\n they are correct. \nBut how is a \nspecifier\n or\n consumers\n to tell what qualifications are relevant, or needed by an installer? \nSome of the rogue traders have been saying they are Part P but not with one of the big \nschemes\n, but with a small group, (which \nreall\ny\n does not exist). This is where we come to the rescue with the ESR (Electrical Safety Reg\nister). This is the list of all the approved electricians, and \ncompanies\n, from \nmultiple\n schemes which a \nconsumer\n or specifier can check to see if\n the contractor \nreall\ny\n is qualified.\nWhat this needs is ESR to be promoted to specifiers and consumers with a publicity campaign, stressing that this is the safe way to have work done.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
