[[[Executive Summary]]]

[[[Recommendations ]]]Wolverhampton City Council asks for the following recommendations to be considered. That central government:Lifts the cap on Housing Revenue Account borrowing and encourages prudent borrowing to stimulate growth.

[[[Responses to questions]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]There are already a number of schemes which operate on a Black Country basis, including offsetting local priorities for funding streams from the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund. It would be sensible to create the devolved area along Black Country lines, where relationships and structures already exist and new powers could work alongside existing schemes. &#xa0;&#xa0;Centralised skills and employment training do not meet Wolverhampton’s needs. If such public services were fully devolved they could be adapted to fit business demands, offering training in skills areas in line with local vacancies. Rather than just ‘complementing’ devolution, these public services should be an integral part of de-centralisation. This would enable them to provide a holistic approach to service provision and use funding in the most effective way. However such devolution would need to be complemented with sufficient investment from central government to tackle problems prevalent in deprived areas like the Black Country. Resolving issues around employability and skills gaps would need to be a key part of the devolution process, or regional growth could not be realised. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]The Black Country devolved area would be governed via the joint committee model. This structure has already been established to deal with the Government’s agenda for greater local decision making under the City Deal and Growth Deal, and existing relationships could be expanded. &#xa0;Any decision made by the Joint Committee is in law a decision of all four councils’ Cabinets. The membership of the Joint Committee is made up of the four leaders of the Black Country councils. The chair of the LEP has a right to attend and speak at meetings but cannot cast a vote. There is also an existing supplementary Advisory Group which presents proposals to the Joint Committee. Such proposals can come from any of the councils, individually or jointly, and/or the Black Country Consortium and LEP. &#xa0;This existing structure would be used to implement fiscal devolution in the Black Country. Each council would remain independent in other matters and hold their own elections. &#xa0;&#xa0;The devolved area would be governed by the existing joint committee structure. Each authority would maintain its independence and hold its own elections. There would also be a local authority representative on each LEP board. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]There is already evidence of successful joint working in Wolverhampton. Recently, Jaguar Land Rover selected the i54 site as the location for its new engine plant. This was brought about by joint working between Wolverhampton City Council, Staffordshire County Council and South Staffordshire District Council.  MOOG also opted to move its new plant to i54 and stay within the region. This was only made possible with support from Wolverhampton City Council, Staffordshire County Council and Staffordshire Council. Wolverhampton City Council and Staffordshire County Council have borrowed £37 million against the business rates they will receive from the Enterprise Zone. This loan will fund the changes to the M54 slip road, giving easier access to the Zone. It is believed that this is the first time local authorities have been responsible for funding major changes to a motorway. Evidently, greater economic freedoms coupled with effective partnerships allow more innovative ways of working. Greater economic control would incentivise more private investment in joint ventures, and would enable Wolverhampton to plan for the long term. &#xa0;&#xa0;Fiscal devolution to the Black Country would provide wider geographical benefits. The subsequent economic growth would act as a catalyst for wider growth and enable further opportunities for expanded partnership work. Additionally, a vibrant job market in the Black Country would create jobs for both Black Country residents and our catchment areas whilst encouraging relocation to its surrounding areas.  

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;Reform of the existing system is essential, but there is no preference as to whether it would precede or be part of large scale constitutional change, as long as it happened. &#xa0;&#xa0;All of the taxes mentioned above would be welcomed as part of a devolution scheme. Even if the regulation of council tax was relaxed, instead of fully devolved, the impact on Wolverhampton would be positive. Re-banding properties and the removal of the referendum threshold would give far greater freedom and enable the local authority to respond to local needs. The de-centralisation of stamp duty would enable Wolverhampton City Council to encourage regeneration in certain local areas, by reducing or waiving stamp duty. The tax could also be used to discourage development in overcrowded areas. The devolution of business rates has the potential to be beneficial, if such devolution is complemented by Single Pot funding. It would enable Wolverhampton City Council to invest to save, and enter into long term commitments with LEPs and other private sector partners, with a secure funding stream in the future. It would cut red tape, by enabling the local authority to give reductions when appropriate to encourage economic growth, rather than businesses having to negotiate a complex system of applying for a discount. Business owners would be able to scrutinise more closely the setting of business rates, as they would be established on a local basis. It would enable the authority to better engage with business leaders, and react more quickly to changing economic circumstances across the city. However such freedoms would only produce economic growth if they were supplemented by LEP Growth Deal funding to help tackle the barriers to growth in the Black Country. These include contaminated land and a lack of infrastructure. &#xa0;Flexibility regarding council tax and business rates would be welcomed in the short term before full devolution occurs. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Wolverhampton City Council would welcome the removal of the cap on Housing Revenue Account borrowing. This would enable increased housing construction and a future revenue stream of rents paid to the council. Some level of monitoring could remain to ensure sensible construction. If councils were given full control over business rates and their revenue, then more borrowing would not necessarily be needed. Furthermore, a secure revenue stream would give councils more confidence to borrow. There should also be a change in the dialogue surrounding borrowing - rather than being seen as bad debt it should be encouraged, if carried out prudently and sensibly, to stimulate growth. Support from central government and Europe for land remediation would be necessary in order to make such projects financially viable for private investors. &#xa0;&#xa0;The most appropriate scope would be to enable local authorities to raise funds by any means, but not levy new taxes, unless they were accompanied with a very low administrative burden. Revenue raising methods such as a local VAT would most likely result in excessive amounts of local bureaucracy and red tape. Traded and non-statutory services should be allowed to make a profit, which would be re-invested back into the council. The local authority should have full discretion regarding fees and charges, including services such as licensing and planning. Furthermore, such discretionary charges could help discourage undesirable licenses being granted, or mitigate their effects, in a similar way to the night time levy (which should also be discretionary to adapt to local circumstances).&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]Redistribution of the proceeds of growth would need to be treated carefully. Some areas will still suffer from disproportionate stagnation and will need additional funding, but local authorities should not be dis-incentivised to succeed. The level of revenue allowed before being re-distributed should be proportionate to the levels of deprivation within the area – the level of reward should match the effort invested. If some areas are very successful solely because of their location, their threshold should be lower. The economic landscape of Britain is not a level playing field and such financial redistribution should be used to help address this inequity. Wolverhampton City Council strongly emphasise the need for fairness in the redistribution of funds, and for the levels of deprivation within each devolved area to be taken into account when allocating funding.
