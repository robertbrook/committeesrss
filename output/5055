[normal]Written evidence from 
[normal]the 
[normal]Gwent Police and Crime Panel

[normal]              [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]I am responding to the Committee’s inquiry into Police and Crime Commissioners
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As you are aware, the circumstances surrounding the retirement of the former Chief Constable for Gwent earlier this year 
[normal]was widely reported in the news and 
[normal]caused considerable public concern.  The matter was 
[normal]also the 
[normal]subject 
[normal]of 
[normal]inquiries by the Gwent Police and Crime Panel and your committee.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]T
[normal]he Panel acknowledge that the actions taken by the 
[normal]Gwent Police and Crime 
[normal]Commissioner 
[normal]were 
[normal]in compliance with the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act
[normal].  However, the Panel 
[normal]were not 
[normal]convinced that the current legislative framework provides the correct balance between a Commissioners right to remove a Chief Constable (or ask them to retire voluntarily) and a Chief Constable’s ability to demonstrate their suitability to continue (in relation to performance related issues).  
[normal]The Panel believe that 
[normal]the first stage of any process to remove or retire a Chief Constable should be undertaken after a prescribed and documented performance assessment has been completed.  This process should be undertaken on a confidential basis and would provide an opportunity for a Commissioner to record performance concerns and give a Chief Constable time to address them or consider their future.  This should be a precursor to any formal or informal process before a Commissioner can remove or retire a Chief Constable.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Turning to the wider role and powers of Police and Crime Panels, the light touch support and challenge expected by the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 
[normal]is not realistic or satisfactory given the wide ranging powers exercised by PCCs. 
[normal] 
[normal]As these new arrangements settle down PCPs are meeting more frequently to ensure they have sufficient capacity to support and hold their PCC to account (Gwent PCP ha
[normal]s 
[normal]met 8 times since January 
[normal]2013 
[normal]and has another meeting planned before the end of the year). 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If real challenge and accountability is to be achieved the role of Panels must be stren
[normal]gthened to ensure that PCPs are consulted before major decisions are taken.  
[normal]Alternatively, 
[normal]if the go
[normal]vernment
[normal] 
[normal]is
[normal] content with ‘light touch’ accountability for PCCs then 
[normal]it
[normal] should acknowledge that the role and effectiveness of PCPs will be limited to a broad overview which will have limited influence.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I hope the above comments assist the Committee’s inquiry.
