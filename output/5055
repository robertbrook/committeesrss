default              default&#xa0;
defaultI am responding to the Committee’s inquiry into Police and Crime Commissioners
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs you are aware, the circumstances surrounding the retirement of the former Chief Constable for Gwent earlier this year 
defaultwas widely reported in the news and 
defaultcaused considerable public concern.  The matter was

defaultinquiries by the Gwent Police and Crime Panel and your committee.
default&#xa0;
defaultT
defaulthe Panel acknowledge that the actions taken by the 
defaultGwent Police and Crime 
defaultCommissioner 
defaultwere 
defaultin compliance with the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act
default.  However, the Panel 
defaultwere not 
defaultconvinced that the current legislative framework provides the correct balance between a Commissioners right to remove a Chief Constable (or ask them to retire voluntarily) and a Chief Constable’s ability to demonstrate their suitability to continue (in relation to performance related issues).  
defaultThe Panel believe that 
defaultthe first stage of any process to remove or retire a Chief Constable should be undertaken after a prescribed and documented performance assessment has been completed.  This process should be undertaken on a confidential basis and would provide an opportunity for a Commissioner to record performance concerns and give a Chief Constable time to address them or consider their future.  This should be a precursor to any formal or informal process before a Commissioner can remove or retire a Chief Constable.   
default&#xa0;
defaultTurning to the wider role and powers of Police and Crime Panels, the light touch support and challenge expected by the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 
defaultis not realistic or satisfactory given the wide ranging powers exercised by PCCs. 
default 
defaultAs these new arrangements settle down PCPs are meeting more frequently to ensure they have sufficient capacity to support and hold their PCC to account (Gwent PCP ha
defaults 
defaultmet 8 times since January 
default2013 
defaultand has another meeting planned before the end of the year). 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultIf real challenge and accountability is to be achieved the role of Panels must be stren
defaultgthened to ensure that PCPs are consulted before major decisions are taken.

default&#xa0;
defaultI hope the above comments assist the Committee’s inquiry.
