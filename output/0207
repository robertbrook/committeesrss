Written evidence submitted by [bold]Northumbria University Centre for Forensic Science[bold] (FSS016)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Northumbria University Centre for Forensic Science’
[normal] [bold]mission is to conduct influential interdisciplinary research on forensic science theory and practice in order to improve its contribution to criminal justice and the safeguarding of human rights. Its membership consists of 
[normal]five
[normal] members of academic staff including Professors of sociology and
[normal] forensic science, and practitioners who contribute over fifty year
[normal]s’ 
[normal]professional experience to the Centre
[normal]’s activities
[normal]. It hosts four full-time postgraduate and postdoctoral researchers, and is supported by Leverhulme Trust, EU Framework 7 and other international research grants and contracts.
[normal]The following comments are offered in response to the request for written evidence. They represent the views of the Centre’s members and are not necessarily those of our employer.
[normal]1.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The present Government’s measures for forensic science look like an 
[normal]ad hoc
[normal] 
[normal]reaction
[normal] 
[normal]to
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] decision to close the Forensic Science Service
[normal] (FSS)
[normal] 
[normal]made 
[normal]on
[normal] the basis of
[normal] external drivers. This is not a strategy.
[normal]1.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The issues of research and development, and support for criminal justice are complex.
[normal]1.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The
[normal] 
[normal]FSS
[normal] enjoyed a
[normal] substantial capital and recurrent expenditure budget for research, 
[normal]underpinning its 
[normal]output
[normal]—as measured by publications in peer reviewed international scientific journals, for
[normal] example. 
[normal]The FSS research budget and facilities would have impressed the science faculties of many research Universities, and it needs to be asked whether the FSS delivered value for money in research—by comparison with a large science department in a research University, for example. 
[normal]1.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In any event, however, government funding has essentially evaporated and focused research on this scale has ceased. In its place, it is proposed that 
[normal]the Research Councils (RCUK) and Technology Strategy Board (TSB) fill the vacuum. RCUK, however, have a very disappointing track record whe
[normal]re
[normal] forensic scie
[normal]nce funding is concerned and it would be naïve to assume this situation will improve significantly. The TSB route may favour near-to-market activities, but
[normal] not more innovative ones and
[normal] is also yet to be proven.
[normal]1.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Support for criminal justice presently relies on an evidently unstable commercial market and
[normal] newly-expanded
[normal] police forensic science 
[normal]laboratory activities
[normal].
[normal] While it is easy to attribute 
[normal]the 
[normal]errors in
[normal] some recent cases—
[normal]the Gareth Williams and Adam Scott cases
[normal], for example—
[normal]to fundamental
[normal]ly
[normal] 
[normal]flawed standards and regulation
[normal], the
[normal]y
[normal] 
[normal]may be
[normal] a
[normal] 
[normal]more 
[normal]superficial
[normal] consequence of ‘bedding in’ a new structure
[normal]—
[normal]indefensible though they may be
[normal].
[normal]1.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The subsuming of forensic science back into the police service represents a fundamental risk to the justice system. While the FSS derived its income overwhelmingly from prosecution or police work, it was at least a nominal step away from the investigation and hence had a measure of independence, albeit a small one.
[normal]1.7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The police laboratories handling forensic work prior to the establishment of the FSS were considered too close to investigations and prosecuting authorities. Indeed, o
[normal]ne of the reasons the FSS was established was because police laboratories were seen as potential or real causes of wrongful convictions. In this respect, the current measures are a dangerous step back to the days of the Guildford Four, Birmingham Six, Judith Ward and other all too numerous cases of miscarriages of justice.
[normal]1.8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A further substantial threat to the justice system is an overall reduction in the frequency of analysis of physical evidence
[normal]. This may tend to favour the prosecution, 
[normal]because
[normal] it is the result of cost-based measures amounting to a disincentive to search for further evidence which may have the power to exonerate an innocent suspect
[normal].
[normal]2.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Any answer to this question must be largely subjective as it depends on what is meant by ‘smoothly’ and ‘within budget’. 
[normal]Inadequate investigation of physical evidence in criminal investigation and miscarriages of justice
[normal] whether
[normal] 
[normal]potential or real 
[normal]are clearly unacceptable, but given such radical restructuring undertaken in the context of a global economic downturn it might be argued that
[normal] the transition
[normal]—although not without substantial problems—has been relatively smooth as far as the justice system is concerned, and not as disastrous as 
[normal]many
[normal] may have predicted. 
[normal]Was there
[normal] ever
[normal] a budget for closure?
[normal] The cost of closure may presently exceed the losses the FSS had 
[normal]persistently 
[normal]sustained
[normal], but a more realistic and pragmatic measure of financial probity may be whether forensic science is delivered reliably
[normal],
[normal] efficiently, and 
[normal]cost-
[normal]effective
[normal]ly
[normal] in the medium term. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Gareth Williams and Adam Scott cases offer evidence that the restructuring of the market has affected the justice system and standards. Equally, however, it may be noted that the FSS also made rather inexcusable errors from time to time and the current difficulties may be more superficial than fundamental.
[normal]3.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The restructuring has led to a cost-burden for staff training and retraining, as well as development of new research.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The present structure of the Forensic Science Regulator’s Office is fundamental to the on-going problems in the forensic science sector. It lacks independence from the police, affecting both the financial viability of the commercial market
[normal] (see (5))
[normal] and the judicial impartiality of forensic science service delivery—in particular, via the retrograde step of the reintroduction of poli
[normal]ce laboratories (see (6)) and an overall reduction in testing (see (1)).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]M
[normal]arket regulation
[normal],
[normal] and standards and accreditation functions should be separate, and 
[normal]entirely independent of the Home Office.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]M
[normal]arket regulation activities should
[normal] follow the model of other regulatory bodie
[normal]s such as OFWAT, OFTEL or OFCOM and 
[normal]be responsible for:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3.1.
[normal] 
[normal]Licencing forensic science service providers
[normal]4.3.2.
[normal] 
[normal]Balancing costs to the taxpayer against the need to have a viable market
[normal]4.3.3.
[normal] 
[normal]Encouraging investment
[normal], research
[normal] and innovation
[normal]4.3.4.
[normal] 
[normal]Encouraging competition where it benefits the taxpayer and the justice system
[normal]4.3.5.
[normal] 
[normal]Balancing the interests of the Home Office against the interests of the provider
[normal]4.3.6.
[normal] 
[normal]Ensuring the market works in the interests of justice and the rule of law
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Regulation accreditation of forensic science practices should be conducted by another independent body that might be likened to the Drinking Water Inspectorate and might be called the Forensic Science Inspectorate. It is important that this body has the authority to be proactive in ensuring ethical and effective use of forensic science technology and procedures.
[normal]              
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Forensic science standards and proficiency testing should be the responsibility a third body. It might be subsumed within the wider
[normal] activities of a
[normal] scientific standards and proficiency testing
[normal] body similar, for 
[normal]example, to the US National Institute of Standards and Technology, which is part of the US Department of Commerce.
[normal] Presently LGC, a commercial company, undertakes many such activities in the UK.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The body responsible market regulation might be called OFFOR. 
[normal]OFFOR would hear representation from the Home Office / Police, the forensic science service providers, and the Forensic Science Inspectorate (who would in turn ensure providers meet independent scientific and proficiency standards).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We estimate the
[normal] 
[normal]e
[normal]xternal forensic market 
[normal](
[normal]i
[normal].
[normal]e
[normal].
[normal] work done by non-police forensic suppliers
[normal])
[normal] was running at about £170 million per annum until about 2010.  The market 
[normal]then 
[normal]shrank rapidly
[normal]. 
[normal]ACPO were suggesting 
[normal]a
[normal] likely
[normal] 
[normal]external market of £110 million 
[normal]in the years following
[normal] FSS closure
[normal].  
[normal]We
[normal] suggest that the curr
[normal]ent market is
[normal] a lot
[normal] smaller than this—
[normal]possibly around £
[normal]60
[normal] million. 
[normal]The
[normal] Home Office tendering mechanism 
[normal]pushes
[normal] providers to be even more competitive
[normal] on price and it is questionable
[normal] whether the provision of forensic science to the UK is financially viable
[normal] under Home Office policy
[normal].  
[normal]While
[normal] police provision 
[normal]may appear
[normal] cheaper
[normal], substantial costs—for buildings, utilities, management and capital costs—may be hidden, and ACPO appears to be unable to cost these expenses, which will be considerable.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The closure of the FSS and unpredictability of the outcome of tenders for regional contracts have badly affected financial viability and 
[normal]staff complements—cycles of recruitment and redundancy—
[normal]of forensic science providers.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The present procurement structure favours driving down police costs at the expense of stability, investment, innovation and judicial probity. This may risk favouring internal institutional agendas over the rule of law. The structure 
[normal]could 
[normal]be
[normal] better
[normal] organized
[normal], such as
[normal] according to the model outlined in (4) above, for example
[normal], or some other viable model
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The closure of the FSS has dispersed its staff. Many former FSS forensic scientists find themselves in employment with the commercial forensic science providers and in the newly-expanded police laboratories
[normal], only to find themselves subject to further retrenchments. O
[normal]thers have collaborated to establish bureaux services
[normal] and a very
[normal] small number have joined the University sector
[normal]. M
[normal]any have left the profession altogether.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Again, the question invites a subjective response. What exactly is meant by ‘a loss of intellectual wealth’? Undoubtedly, many experienced forensic scientists have left the profession, but not all of them, and although somewhat diminished a wealth of knowledge—it might be argued—remains in the system.
[normal] The ‘institutional’ knowledge of the FSS is undoubtedly lost.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]One place known to develop, nurture and disseminate knowledge is the University. The FSS might have taken a more constructive role in fostering forensic science as peer science in the academy in order that a ‘wealth of knowledge’ might have been developed and sustained more widely
[normal] in the first place
[normal].
[normal] In future, better integration of the policing, commercial and academic research is necessary, and an academic sector could provide expertise independent of the commercial market as and when required.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The overall arrangements are quite unsatisfactory. Piecemeal storage of evidence in the FSS archive and in the archives of individual police services 
[normal]may
[normal] lead to 
[normal]physical
[normal] deterioration, mix-ups and loss. The uncertainty regarding the organisation of the forensic science market and the structure of police services and police laboratories indicates on-going archiving of evidence should be insulated from inevitable further changes and restructuring. There is a propensity for evidence to ‘go missing’ in investigations of police malpractic
[normal]e.
[normal]8.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is essential that physical evidence is archived centrally, securely and independently. Such measures are also essential for proper investigation of cold cases, use of as yet unanticipated new technologies, and potential developments in national or international legal frameworks.
