[normal]Professor N J [bold]Soper[bold] &amp; Dr. (Mrs) A M [bold]Soper[bold] – Written evidence [bold]Written evidence concerning Rights of Way and protection of the Environment.
[normal]In recent times many of our ancient ‘green lanes’ have suffered serious damage and disturbance from recreational use by motorcycles and four-wheel drive vehicles.  For at least the last ten years there has been a great deal of public support for banning such vehicles, resulting in the imposition of Traffic Regulation Orders on sensitive routes.
[normal]An important example is Mastiles Lane, between Malham and Kilnsey in the Yorkshire Dales National Park, a route with history going back to Roman times and earlier.  The prevention of use by recreational vehicles has enabled the lane to recover from a deeply-rutted quagmire to a safe and peaceful green lane, as it has been for centuries.  It is once again fit for walkers, cyclists and horses.
[normal]However there are many other routes especially in the north of England which need protection from misuse.  To simplify the achievement of this, the 
[normal]Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance[bold] 
[normal](YDGLA)[bold] is proposing that the following clauses be included in the Deregulation Bill:
[normal]All unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs), and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads (UCRs) should be recognised as not being part of the ordinary roads network, and should be re-classified as Restricted Byways.[bold]When a local authority declines to impose a traffic regulation order that is widely-supported by the public, there should be a right of appeal, either to an independent inspector, or a magistrate. [bold]The first clause would maintain the right of way for pedestrians, horses, pedal cyclists and essential vehicles (e.g. emergency vehicles and farm vehicles) but deny the right of way to non-essential motorised vehicles.  The second clause would raise awareness of how serious the problem of ‘off-roaders’ has become.
[normal]We strongly support this proposal and the formal submissions made by other environmental organisations including The Green Lanes Environmental Action Group (GLEAM), the Green Lanes Protection Group (GLPL) and the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance (PDGLA).
