defaultWritten evidence from the 
defaultChartered Institution of Highways and Transportation (CIHT) (SRN 035)
default&#xa0;
defaultCIHT is a membership organisation representing over 12,000 people who work in the highways and transportation sector.  CIHT members plan, design, build, operate and maintain best-in-class transport systems 
defaultand infrastructure, whilst respecting the imperatives of improving safety, ensuring economic competitiveness and minimising environmental impact.
default&#xa0;
defaultCIHT welcomes the opportunity to submit evidence to the Transport

defaulttegic Road network
default. 
defaultThis response incorporates the views of CIHT’s Council which 
defaultis a

default’
default interests and opinions
default. We would welcome the opportunity to expand upon our response as required.
default&#xa0;
defaultCI
defaultHT welcomes the recognition of 
defaultthe importance of 
defaultcertainty of investment an
defaultd reform to the Highways Agency set out in Action for Roads. 
defaultMore radical changes to the management of the network may have the capacity for greater improvements in the longer ter
defaultm 
defaultand it is encouraging
default that such options have been considered in Action for Roads.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe standard of highway expertise in the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default is very high and is recognised worldwide. Our networks are amongst the safest in the world and our professional stan
defaultdards are highly regarded. The 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default has contributed significantly to the development of highways as an increasingly more efficient sector of industry.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is therefore appropriate that Action for Roads proposes an incremental change to the 
defaultmanagement of the Strategic road network that builds on that expertise. Nevertheless the changes that are required do require 
defaulta boldness
default in approach so that the investment proposed can be used effectively to deliver real improvements to customers over time
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultCertainty
default,
default and continuity
default of investment over a sustained period is important if overall improvements to the network are to be delivered effectively and efficiently. This need for certainty applies both to the reformed Highways Ag
defaultency and other “client” bodies and the wider supply chain of organisations working in the sector.
default&#xa0;
defaultGovernment needs to provide the certainty required by the supply chain side of the sector to invest in resource and capability to deliver the investment envi
defaultsaged. 
defaultThe Roads Investment Strategy needs to be confirmed and be committed to quickly by all parties. 
defaultThis will allow the Highways Agency to develop a robust pipeline of requirements for its supply chain in a form that allows the supply chain to 
defaultinnovate and invest over a period of time.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultCIHT 
defaultargues
default that there is a clear need for a tra
defaultnsportation strategy that sets a 
defaultclear framework of requirements over a sustained period fo
defaultr all elements of our transportation 
defaultnetworks. 
default 
defaultThis strategy (or strategies) should include the strategic and local road networks,
default r
defaultail, aviation and ports and set
default out how those networks integrate with one another.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe publication of Action for Roads is welcome in that it 
defaultsets out the importance of t
defaulthe strategic road network and 
defaultaims to define the needs of the strategic road network, linking investment over a period to the management structure required to deliver it. There is a concern that the absence of a national transport strategy (or strategies) 
defaultmay mean that the investment identified in Action for Roads is not utilised effectively. The strategy should cove
defaultr
default other transport modes and importantly the overarching policy for the local roads network.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn developing its approach the government needs t
defaulto ensure that the importance of understanding how customer needs are addressed in the new model for operation and be specific about how those needs are developed, protected and monitored by a regulator or other arrangement.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe government needs to be bold in recognising the capabilities required of a reformed Highways Agency. Those capabilities are likely to include a clearer appreciation of customer requirements and an expanded commercial capability, informed 
defaultby other sectors. There is also a need for the reformed organisation to have more freedom to allow more innovation and more agility in decision making.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultGovernment should recognise that the success of an improved 
defaultstrategic network in meeting customer needs cannot be met without the local road network being also considered as part of a holistic solution that customers require.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Department for Transport and government need to clearly define the role of the transp
defaultortation network in delivering the policies of the government. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAction for Roads envisages the publication of a draft national policy statement on national networks in 2013. This needs to clearly set out the relationship of the strategic network to other 
defaultnetworks, including the local highway network. It also needs to demonstrate how the policy links to both national and local planning policy, setting out a clear framework for the responsibility and accountability of developing the network.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultresponse to
default the questions are
default set out on the following pages.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default1.1.default&#xa0; 
defaultCIHT welcomes the recognition of 
defaultthe importance of 
defaultcertainty of investment and reform to the Highways Agency.  
default1.2.default&#xa0; 
defaultThe current proposals to be enacted in legislation within this Parliamentary cycle offer a pragmatic and deliverable approach to change.  More 
defaultradical changes
default, for example the introduction of a Regulated Utility Model in conjunction with direct user charging,
default to the management of the network may have the capacity for greater improvements in the longer term and it is good that such options have be
defaulten considered in Action for Roads.
default1.3.default&#xa0; 
defaultCertainty of investment over a sustained period is important if overall improvements to the network are to be delivered effectively and efficiently. This need for certainty applies both to the reformed Highways Agency and
default other “client” bodies and the wider supply chain of organisations working in the sector. 
default1.4.default&#xa0; 
defaultThe five year funding period set out (in the Road Investment Strategy) is a welcome improvement from annualised budget cycles.  However, this falls short of the peri
defaultods required to undertake a holistic approach to asset management and delivery of customer expectations.  
default1.5.default&#xa0; 
defaultExperience from other models and schemes, for example on the M25 D
defaultesign Build Finance &amp; Operate
default scheme, and PFI investments in the local highway sect
defaultor have delivered real benefits through considering needs over a 25 year period.  Such approaches have enabled ambitious investment programmes to be delivered over a five year period followed by managed, longer operational periods. This 'invest to save' ap
defaultproach helps reduce ongoing operational costs through upfront investment in the asset. 
default1.6.default&#xa0; 
defaultCertainty of investment over a sustained period will also allow a more resilient network to be developed, allowing the reformed Highways Agency and its supply chain to 
defaultmeet the potential challenges of climate change by taking a longer term view of the needs of the network.
default 
default1.7.default&#xa0; 
defaultThe increased level of investment is also welcomed as the sector has faced budget reductions that have led to asset deterioration.
default The investment ide
defaultntified will enable a series of key benefits to be delivered such as improving capacity, reducing congestion and improving reliability. These benefits will improve the network for users and deliver environmental benefits
default..
default1.8.default&#xa0; 
defaultThe sector already has a lot of e
defaultxperience to build on.  For instance, the lessons learnt from the managed motorways programme already underway have demonstrated the ability of the sector to deliver additional capacity withi
defaultn existing highway corridors. These improvements have been delive
defaultred more efficiently than full motorway improvements, delivering benefits to users and the environment in a shorter timescale.
default1.9.default&#xa0; 
defaultFuture Investment strategies should be informed by linking an understanding of the assets required to deliver all the purposes of
default the network derived from customer need. A proposed approach is set out in our response to Question 3 below.
default1.10.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCertainty of investment and clarity of the pipeline of works anticipated is fundamental to the ability of the supply chain to deliver a significant
default programme of investment in the timescales set out. If certainty is not delivered then 
defaultproviding 
defaultincreased resource will have a time lag before benefits can be 
defaultfully 
defaultdelivered.
default1.11.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is welcome that the importance of the local road network is recognised by Ac
defaulttion for Roads and that the effects on non-vehicular highway users are addressed to some degree. 
default1.12.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNearly all journeys on the strategic road network begin and end on the local highway network. Unless linked to consideration of wider effects, improvements to
default the strategic road network (SRN) may have significant effects upon the local road network affecting all highway users, local communities and the environment. These effects may occur through diversion onto unsuitable parts of the network by charging, conge
defaultstion or control of access to the SRN. Customers do not take a different view of the networks they travel 
defaulton,
default a consistent appropriate standard of service delivery needs to be the aim.
default1.13.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe issue of how the viewpoint of customers is taken into account in th
defaulte development of the network is fundamental to real and lasting improvements in the network. The role of a “regulator” acting in customers interests is commonplace in other sectors and in the transport sector and should be introduced alongside changes to t
defaulthe form of the Highways Agency in the way it manages the network. We set out in our response to Question 3 below how the requirements of customers should be 
defaultdeveloped,
default a regulator could play an important role in that.
default1.14.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultConsideration of the local road networ
defaultk in conjunction with highway authorities, Local Transport Boards (LTBs) and Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) is vital and needs to be recognised and implemented as part of the changes proposed set out in Action for Roads.
default1.15.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe increased amount of maint
defaultenance investment for the local road network is welcome.  However, this must be considered alongside a reduced revenue budget for local authorities. There is the risk that the overall increase in investment could be jeopardised if the issue of the
default 
defaultcontribu
defaulttion
default that the local network makes to the success of the S
defaultRN
default is not fully considered.
default1.16.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCIHT welcomes and supports the importance of the Highways Maintenance Efficiency Programme (HMEP) 
defaulthttp://www.dft.gov.uk/hmep
default in delivering change to the local roads sector
default and will continue to work with the programme to ensure that linkages to the development of the SRN are maintained and enhanced.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.1.default&#xa0; 
defaultCIHT 
defaultargues
default that there is a 
defaultreal
default need for a tra
defaultnsportation strategy that sets a 
defaultclear framework of requirements over a sustained period fo
defaultr all elements of our transportation networks. 
default 
defaultThis strategy (or strategies) should include the strategic and local road networks,
default r
defaultail, aviation and
default ports and set
default out how those networks integrate with one another.
default2.2.default&#xa0; 
defaultThe publication of Action for Roads is welcome in that it 
defaultsets out the importance of the SRN and 
defaultaims to define the needs of the network, linking investment over a period to the management structure required to deliver it. There is a concern that the absence of a 
defaultN
defaultational 
defaultT
defaultransport 
defaultS
defaulttrategy (or strategies) may mean that the investment identified in Ac
defaulttion for Roads is not utilised effectively. The strategy should cove
defaultr
default other transport modes and importantly the overarching policy for the local roads network.
default2.3.default&#xa0; 
defaultIt is welcome that the government have, over time, devolved responsibility for the local roads n
defaultetwork to a local level in terms of decisions where funding should be spent
default,
default 
defaulthowever
default an overall policy framework is required for highway authorities and other bodies to work within. T
defaulth
defaultis must set out the aims and objectives of the network in relation to th
defaulte needs of the country. 
default2.4.default&#xa0; 
defaultThere could be benefit in considering the reform of how improvements to the local road network are delivered. The current arrangement contains inefficiencies, introduces inconsistencies and does not make best use of the pool of ski
defaultlled resource available.
default2.5.default&#xa0; 
defaultHow the national and local highway network contributes to and enables planning policy to be developed effectively and sustainably across the country is a clear requirement of government at all levels
default.
default 
default2.6.default&#xa0; 
defaultA clear understanding of the 
defaultpurposes of the highway network for all its customers will help develop that strategy and its development will also allow clear accountability for delivery of the strategy to be set out to the different bodies required to deliver it.
default&#xa0;
default3.1.default&#xa0; 
defaultThe contribution that the 
defaulthighway
default netw
defaultork is required to make to a range of policy areas should 
defaultbe clearly defined in
default the strategy described above
default in our response to Question 2
default. In order to develop a robust prediction to underpin development of the network a series of 
defaultkey steps should be undertaken a
defaultlongside existing economic modelling tools
default. 
default3.2.default&#xa0; 
defaultThe development of these st
defaulteps should be undertaken by all engaged in the sector including
default the gove
defaultrnment, 
defaultHighways Agency and related authorities on the adjoining networks
default, groups representing the sector and the supply chain to the sector. 
default3.3.default&#xa0; 
defaultThe steps CIHT propose, based on a system
defaults thinking approach, are:
default&#xa0;
default3.3.1.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIdentify the different classes of groups
default (customers)
default who are reliant on the network. As well as 
defaultdifferent 
defaultusers of the network these customer groups could in
defaultclude amongst others, adjacent communities, non-
defaultusers of the network, th
defaulte environment, her
defaultitage and the highway asset itself.
default3.3.2.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIdentify 
defaultthe different purposes that the network is required to deli
defaultver to different customer groups
default3.3.3.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAnalysis to confirm how the network will best meet the different purposes identified and to identify 
defaultwhat investment is required to meet those different purposes of all customers.
default3.3.4.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultConfirm the wider benefits that will arise from meeting the needs of all customer groups and thereby define the Value for Money of the investment.
default3.3.5.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIdentify 
defaultareas where investmen
defaultt in other modes will better meet
default the needs of customers and identify the parties best able to deliver that investment
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.4.default&#xa0; 
defaultThe investment identified
default should b
defaulte
default considered alongside the wider econ
defaultomic
default need
defaults
default of the surrounding area. Action for 
defaultR
defaultoads proposes 
defaultroute based studies as the basis for d
defaulteveloping investment strategies. In order to be effective,
default these strategies need to work closely with LE
defaultP
defaults, 
defaultLTB
defaults and local authorities to ensure all appropriate customer needs are addressed.
default3.5.default&#xa0; 
defaultI
defaultn proposing the additional
default analysis outlined above it should be recognised that the strategic road network is required to d
defaulteliver in such a complex environment
default there can never be a complete answer
default.
default 
defaultI
defaultt is important that benefits are delivered effectively
default against a pipeline with a hi
defaultgh degree of certainty
default rather than constant refinement of modelling that will never
default be able to
default present a complete
default or accurate
default picture. 
default3.6.default&#xa0; 
defaultCIHT suggest that the work proposed above should be carried out alongside existing appraisal of schemes in the short ter
defaultm.
default3.7.default&#xa0; 
defaultThe role of the regulator identified in the response to question 1 in identifying the needs of customers is an important one t
defaulto be developed as the Highways Agency changes form.
default&#xa0;
default4.1.default&#xa0; 
defaultSignificant improvements to the reliability
default, 
defaultefficiency
default and safety
default of travel have already been m
defaulta
defaultde on the S
defaultRN 
defaultby in
defaultvestment utilising technology. T
defaulthe increasing 
defaultlength of the network utilising Manage
defaultd 
defaultM
defaultotorway techniques to 
defaultincrease capacity are welcome. T
defaulthe technology available to vehicle users, both in terms of safety and i
defaultnformation have developed and wi
defaultll continue t
defaulto
default develop rapidly.
default4.2.default&#xa0; 
defaultThe reformed operator of the network needs to work closely with 
defaultthe vehicle development sector to maximise the benefit of investm
defaultents both to vehicles and the network. Having c
defaultlarity 
defaultof customer needs and purposes as outlined in the response to the earlier question
default will play an important role in that development.
default4.3.default&#xa0; 
defaultInfor
defaultmation n
defaulteeds 
defaulto
defaultf customers across the whole 
defaulttransport network, including rail should
default be continuously developed from a customer’s perspective. There have been welcome improvements in the information available to customers for end to end journeys which includ
defaulte walking and cycl
defaulting. This information needs to i
defaultnform the development of the network
default and will
default r
defaultequire very different
default skills
default, based around understanding of customer analysis and needs
default to be bought into the reformed Highways 
defaultA
defaultgency from different sectors.
default 
default4.4.default&#xa0; 
defaultThe way in which technology changes customer behaviour over time will need to be monitored by the reformed Highways Agency and incorporated into the investment planning of the network.
default4.5.default&#xa0; 
defaultProviders on the network should be given the freedom to utilise techno
defaultlogy in how they deliver services to customers of the network rather than a prescriptive specification of how they provide a service. Continuing improvements in the safety of road workers, 
defaultbought
default about by the use of technology should be encouraged.
default4.6.default&#xa0; 
defaultThe use
default of technology to regulate access to the network in order to manage traffic volumes
default and release extra capacity
default will be a key area for 
defaultdevelopment, but will require a
default holistic approach with adjoining highway authorities to deliver an effective solution.
default4.7.default&#xa0; 
defaultThe
default use of BIM technology on the highways network should be a focus for the reformed Highways Agency and its supply chain. The use of technology to develop better understanding of whole asset information will lead to more efficient management of the service.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.1.default&#xa0; 
defaultThe amount of income derived from Vehicle Excise Duty and fuel du
defaultty is significantly more than that spent on the roads network. Parts of the network, particularly the local roads network have significant requirements for investment to maintain the standard of the asset and this has been partially recognised in the addit
defaultional expenditure proposed in Action for Roads.
default5.2.default&#xa0; 
defaultExperience from around the wor
defaultld suggests that there is no
default single model that provides an appropriate model for a reformed strategic network to follow
default in terms of increasing investment
default. In many countries the u
defaultse of tolling to provide an income stream to finance investment has been successful. Clearly introduction
default of a widespread n
defaultational road user charging scheme is not envisaged in Action for 
defaultR
defaultoads
default.
default 
defaultIt 
defaultshould not be ruled out 
defaulthowever, 
defaultuntil a clearer picture o
defaultf the ultimate investment need of the network, informed by analysis of customer needs has 
defaultb
defaulteen made. 
default5.3.default&#xa0; 
defaultIt is also s
defaultensible not to focus on the
default argument between public or private investment. Each is likely to play a role in funding inv
defaultestment in the future n
defaultetwork, and more 
defaultopportunities should be found for Public Private Partnerships in which the Government invests and takes on a minority shareholding. 
default5.4.default&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthere have been valuable lessons learnt in the highways sector through the use of Private Finance funded s
defaultchemes on both the strategic and local networks. Benefits have included:
default&#xa0;
default5.4.1.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA whole life view of service delivery over a significant period of time, with investment occurring over a short initial period follow
defaulted by a long period of service delivery t
defaulto defined performance 
defaultstandards that reflect the needs
default of service users.
default5.4.2.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPrivate sector providers, given the certainty of a clear programme of service delivery
default have invested in the development of new techniques and products, leading to efficiency improveme
defaultnts in service delivery.
default5.4.3.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA focus on managing long term asset management techniques as risks of performance have been moved to the service provider
default&#xa0;
default5.5.default&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthese benefits, combined with a clear consideration of customer needs
default outlined above
default 
defaultare consistent with man
defaulty of the features of 
defaulta regulated asset base
default model used in other sectors. This model may 
defaultprovide the basis for a more robust funding model for the sector. Such a model could incorporate both public and private investment, dependant on different needs of the
default network an
defaultd
default could incorporate user charging at a future date.
default5.6.default&#xa0; 
defaultThe experience of other sectors, particularly in the rail sector will be useful in this regard. There would be a particular need for clear regulation to consider the needs for investment in the
default asset base.
default5.7.default&#xa0; 
defaultThe move towards a regulated asset base may well present the opportunity for innovative and new funding streams as the supply chain is broadened by entrants from a wider base of sectors. For example the local highway network in particular cont
defaultains significant amounts of other regulated assets, such as water, telecoms and power networks, all of which require continued investment. The 
defaultscope for efficiencies seem
default potentially high. 
default5.8.default&#xa0; 
defaultThe role for specific investment by business to improve networks t
defaulthat facilitate economic development is one that is already used in the sector but the development of LEPs and LTB’s would point to a wider consideration of the benefits of an enhanced approach.
default5.9.default&#xa0; 
defaultA reformed Highways Agency should be less constrained, more ag
defaultile and be able to take quicker decisions to attract and encourage more investors.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default6.1.default&#xa0; 
defaultThe standard of highway expertise in the United Kingdom is very high and is recognised worldwide. Our networks are amongst the safest in the world and our professional standards are highly regarded. The United Kingdom
default has contributed significantly to the development of highw
defaultays as an increasingly more effi
defaultcient industry.
default6.2.default&#xa0; 
defaultIt is therefore appropriate that Action for Roads proposes an incremental change to the management of the Strategic road network that builds on that expertise. Nevertheless the changes that are required do require 
defaulta boldness
default in approach in order that the i
defaultnvestment proposed can be used effectively to deliver real 
defaultimprovements to the network over time. It would be a mistake to view an incremental change as only a small one requiring minimal investment. 
default6.3.default&#xa0; 
defaultAll of the groups need to encourage the entry of, and d
defaultevelopment of young people into the sector to provide the resource required to deliver future investment.
default6.4.default&#xa0; 
defaultOur views on the cha
defaultnges required are set out below:
default&#xa0;
default6.4.1.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGovernmentdefault:
default6.4.1.1.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Department for Transport and government need to clearly define the role of the t
defaultransportation network in delivering the policies of the government. Action for Roads envisages the publication of a draft national policy statement on national networks in 2013. This needs to clearly set out the relationship of the strategic network to oth
defaulter networks, including the local highway network. It also needs to demonstrate how the policy links to both national and local planning policy, setting out a clear framework for the responsibility and accountability of developing the network. It should cle
defaultarly define the role of government in relation to the reformed Highways Agency.
default6.4.1.2.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe government needs to be bold in recognising the capabilities required of a reformed Highways Agency. In particular it needs to ensure that the importance of understanding how customer needs should be addressed in the new model for operation and be speci
defaultfic about how those needs are protected and monitored by a regulator or other arrangement. Those capabilities are likely to include a clear appreciation of customer requirements, understanding of wider stakeholder needs and an expanded commercial capabilit
defaulty from other sectors. 
default6.4.1.3.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is a need to maintain strong leadership through the process of change whilst the new requirements for the reformed Highways Agency are being fully defined and sourced, using the freedom of the new organisation to bring in new s
defaultkills and capabilities. This will ensure that momentum on delivering the pipeline of investment set out in Action for Roads is maintained.
default6.4.1.4.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGovernment needs to provide the certainty required by the supply chain side of the sector to invest in resource and c
defaultapability to deliver the investment envisaged. The Roads Investment Strategy needs to be confirmed and be committed to quickly by all parties so that the Highways Agency can develop a robust pipeline of requirements for its supply chain.
default6.4.1.5.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGovernment should 
defaultrecognise that the success of an improved strategic network in meeting customer needs cannot be met without the local road network being also considered as part of the solution that customers require.
default&#xa0;

defaultA reformed Highways Agencydefault:
default6.4.2.1.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Highways Agency needs 
defaultthe capacity and capability to change
default, 
defaultbuilding on the expertise that it has built up and maintaining strong leadership. This must not be lost. 
default6.4.2.2.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNeeds to develop an understanding of the wide range of purposes that the network has and further develop its cu
defaultstomer relationship capabilities, bringing in capability from other sectors as required. It should build links across sectors to do so.
default6.4.2.3.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNeeds to recognise the importance of linking to authorities with responsibility for the local road network and economic

defaultcustomer’s 
defaultneeds.
default 
defaultWhilst the reformed Highways Agency will still be subject to European Procurement Regulations other unnecessary procedures should be removed.
default6.4.2.5.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
