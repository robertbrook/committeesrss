[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This submission is made on behalf of the Muslim Women’s Sport Foundation (MWSF).  Established in 2001, the MWSF is an independent registered charity that works to increase the involvement of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) women and girls in sport and physical activity.  These women and girls are often the most inactive of inactive women and girls.  We therefore work with all women across all areas of the United Kingdom and have a focus on religious and cultural sensitivities to directly address the severe underrepresentation of BAME women and girls in all aspects of sport.
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A Generational Issue:[bold] The main question posed by this Committee is in relation to the barriers that “remain” to women’s participation in sport.  Much research and awareness work has been undertaken by the organisations charged with equality and increasing participation of BAME women and girls in sport and this has provided great insight.  However, the situation has not changed on the ground and it is the MWSF’s firm understanding that the barriers faced by these women and girls are largely the same as those faced by many generations of women and girls before them.  In order to halt this trend, meaningful practical interventions are critical as the central focus of Government, Sport England and the National Governing Bodies for the various sports.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Diversity:[bold] Sporting authorities have charged organisations with either increasing participation of women and girls in sport or with focusing on increasing BAME participation in sport.  The MWSF has had direct impact and results, both from a strategic and delivery perspective, in the unique area of BAME women and girls.  These are the most inactive of inactive women and girls.  It is important, therefore, to recognise the particular needs of this rapidly growing group of women and girls and to support the work taking place in this area.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Best practice:[bold] Women and girls from BAME communities do want to be more active and there is a strong latent demand at all ages and despite any barriers that exist.  Every barrier, whether practical, attitudinal or social/cultural, can be overcome with the appropriate solution.  Best practice like that of the MWSF must be celebrated, supported and turned into the only way to work.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Numbers Game:[bold] There are many examples of pockets of good practice activity however the focus within the sports world is firmly on numbers coming through the door rather than a longer-term change of attitudes and approach to ensure sustainability.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Role Models:[bold] There is a severe lack of diverse role models in all areas of sport and so sport isn’t something these women and girls see as “for them” nor is it something to which they aspire thereby preserving the cycle of inactivity.  It is important to ensure that those women and girls we see as role models in sport reflect the society within which we live.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Lottery Funding:[bold] One growing issue is that of the vast majority of funding for increased participation in sport is being sourced from the National Lottery Fund.  This immediately creates a barrier to participation from many BAME women and girls before they have even thought about being active.  The MWSF believes that alternative funding should be made available as a priority through Government and Sport England to groups who cannot access the National Lottery Fund in order for an increase in participation to be seen.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We work from both strategic and practical delivery perspectives with National Governing Bodies, Local Councils and other sports bodies across the United Kingdom in order to achieve our aims.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]BAME women and girls are often the most inactive of inactive women and girls.  We therefore work with all women across all areas of the United Kingdom and have a focus on religious and cultural sensitivities to directly address the severe underrepresentation of BAME women and girls in all aspects of sport.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Women and girls from BAME communities do want to be more active and there is a strong latent demand at all ages and despite any barriers that exist.  There is still a lack of awareness and understanding of the needs of many BAME communities which results in great levels of inactivity.
[normal]Some of the key reasons for the low participation in sport amongst BAME women and girls are:
[normal]3.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A lack of appropriate opportunities which are suited to their needs.  A simple example would be when, in response to local demand for swimming opportunities, many leisure centres will run women-only swimming sessions but cannot guarantee that a female 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]lifeguard
[normal] will be present.  This will clearly prevent many women from attending and reflects poorly on the understanding of these women’s needs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Organisational/practical barriers such as safety concerns and travel time.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Family commitments which will exist throughout these women and girls’ lifetime.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A lack of parental support.  In particular, we find that the influence of the mother is critical to a child’s attitude towards sport and so changing the attitude of the current and future mothers is 
[normal]key
[normal] to reversing the decline in women and girls’ participation in sport.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Negative cultural attitudes toward sport for women do still exist, the most common being that sport is not feminine.  Many BAME communities do not also fully understand the benefits of sport for body and mind.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Other priorities that come ahead of sport, e.g. education, work/career.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]BAME women and girls are often from the most underrepresented and underprivileged groups and face inequalities in all areas of life.  The additional cost of participating in sport together with the attitudes toward sport mean that these women will continue to be inactive unless more is done to support their integration into sport through working on changing attitudes and approaches.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The experiences of girls at school set their attitude to sport for life and it is difficult to reverse this once it is set but not impossible.  The issues that we come across are as follows:
[normal]4.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The focus in physical education lessons is always on those that represent the school in sports and so the majority of girls feel overlooked, neglected and therefore apathetic towards sport.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The motivations to be active for girls as opposed to boys aren’t recognised and so sporting choices are often not appropriate and the girls’ needs are not catered to.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The MWSF believes that simple interventions at school, such as our Schools’ Futsal Project, have a huge and positive impact on the attitudes of girls who are often overlooked and encourage them to participate in sports going forward.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]One of the key issues in the provision of appropriate opportunities is a great lack of appropriate facilities that are suited to the female-only environment that is required for many BAME women and, indeed, that many women from all communities desire.  For example, many new sports halls are built open-plan or with viewing galleries or with gyms overlooking the hall, thereby enabling the general public to view the activity and making the hall unusable for these women.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As indoor facilities are required to adhere to the sensitivities of BAME women and girls, the cost of these facilities are important to the long-term sustainability of projects.  The MWSF finds that the cost of hiring indoor facilities is very high in many areas of the country which, combined with the cost of sport in general, make sustainability very difficult to achieve for activities delivered to BAME women and girls.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]6.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]When considering the reasons for low participation in sport amongst women and girls, it is important that the Committee consider their diversity.  The approaches, solutions and pace of results for BAME communities will be unique and the challenges and recommendations mentioned in the summary of this submission will directly address participation amongst BAME women and girls.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The MWSF is carrying out strategic consultancy both within the BAME female community and with sports bodies to embed the recommendations above within the sports industry.  The MWSF will look to all bodies charged with increasing participation in sport amongst women and girls to support this work.
