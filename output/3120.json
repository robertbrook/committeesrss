"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from David B Wilson (SLC 03\n6\n)\n&#xa0;\nAt the time the inquiry was launched, neither I nor any of my taxi company clients had any submissions to make, but subsequently the driver of a \nBlueline\n Taxis vehicle was involved in a collision with a Metro train at the light controlled level crossing near the \nCallerton\n Parkway Metro Station on Monday, 2 September 2013.\n&#xa0;\nAs of today, the following news coverage is still available online, namely:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAs you will appreciate from the article in the Newcastle Evening Chronicle, the lights at the level crossing had been installed in 2008 and, before the most recent incident, there had been a number of close misses, including one in 2010 in which Newcastle United Football Club’s \nphysio\n Derek Wright pleaded guilty to an offence of driving without due care and attention when he had failed to observe the warning lights, which were said to have been operational for 25 seconds.\n&#xa0;\nImmediately following the \nBlueline\n Taxi collision, Northumbria Police seemed content to accept the assertions made by Nexus, the Metro operators, that the lights were working and that, by implication at least, this was another case of an impatient and reckless driver endangering everyone’s safety!\n&#xa0;\nAs a result of the publicity this incident attracted, several drivers contacted \nBlueline\n Taxis to advise that they had narrowly missed being struck by a Metro train themselves.\n&#xa0;\n Only upon receipt of this information did the police and, one assumes, Nexus undertake a more comprehensive investigation and discovered that, whilst the lights were working correctly, they were not correctly aligned, which meant that they were not visible to drivers until they were effectively at the level crossing.\n&#xa0;\n In the circumstances, maybe Newcastle United’s \nphysio\n was wrong to plead guilty to careless driving in 2010.\n&#xa0;\nIt appears to my client that, perhaps more often than anyone currently appreciates, collisions and near misses at level crossing are not necessarily the result of driver error or impatience, but a failure of rail operators (and the police) to ensure the warning lights are not only working, but correctly aligned, so that they can be clearly seen by drivers as they approach such a level crossing.\n&#xa0;\nWhilst Ian Shanks, managing partner of \nBlueline\n Taxis, and / or I would be pleased to appear again before the Transport Committee in connection with this inquiry, I suspect our evidence would not add as much to the inquiry as would requesting \nspecific information from Nexus and Northumbria Police in connection with every level crossing accident in recent years, including that of 2 September 2013 involving a \nBlueline\n Taxis vehicle.\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
