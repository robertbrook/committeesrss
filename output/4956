[normal]Written evidence from [bold]Essex County Council [bold](LTD0040)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Essex County Council welcomes the Select Committee’s invitation to submit evidence on local decision making for transport schemes and would wish 
[normal]to make 
[normal]the foll
[normal]owing submission
[normal]:
[normal]T[bold]he Rational[bold]e
[normal] 
[normal]The County Council sees the m
[normal]ove from a complex array of challenge funding, local block allocations and major scheme funding routes
[normal], as a positive move 
[normal]signaling
[normal] a new emphasis on local decision making rather than direct control by Central Government. Th
[normal]e newly implemented arrangement
[normal]s for LTB
[normal] funding and LEP SEP funding have already resulted in
[normal] a better basis for local investment priorities to be determined and advanced collectively with partners. 
[normal]The advantages[bold] of undertaking this work in the way being rolled 
[normal]out
[normal] include potentially
[normal] greater transparency of decision-making
[normal] amongst stakeholders
[normal], more involvement of partners 
[normal]and stakeholders 
[normal]in ensuring outcomes are achieved, less bureaucracy in carrying out multiple funding bids
[normal],
[normal] and a pipeline of work
[normal] rather than the pursuit of one-
[normal]of
[normal]f opportunities for funding through challenge bids or major project applications.  
[normal]Possible disadva[bold]ntages[bold] include, less democratic accountability, devising compliant assurance frameworks, the involvement of multiple partners in the local decision making process, the gradual erosion of Local Transport Plans and a possible erosion of autonomy that the Local Tra
[normal]nsport Authorities currently enjoy which carries with it statutory Highway Authority responsibilities.
[normal]The Count
[normal]y Council does not see that 
[normal]local bodies as being 
[normal]set up as 
[normal]separate delivery entities
[normal]; rather they are a
[normal] collection of decision makers engaged upon a collective exercise in prioritizing work
[normal],
[normal] which is then implemented through existing mechanisms. If viewed in this way the capacity already in the system can be harnessed to add value to the process.
[normal] On occasio
[normal]n there may be the need for consultancy assistance but this would be targeted at specific tasks rather than being used on an ongoing basis
[normal] 
[normal]Within the SELTB
[normal] and SELEP the collective resources
[normal] of the organisations
[normal] involved
[normal] has been harnessed to produce an a
[normal]ssurance framework to satisfy Government and National Audit requirements
[normal],
[normal] as well as an internal prioritisation process where benefits both transport and economic can be drawn together from the collective wisdom, perspective and knowledge of the parent org
[normal]anisations.
[normal]An optimum body[bold] is difficult to specify. 
[normal] 
[normal]An
[normal]y
[normal] body set up needs to reflect the circumstances, geography, statutory powers, resourcing and partnerships which can be harnessed by those who form the driving force to plan and deliver transport impr
[normal]ovements. LTBs and LEPS vary across the country. Some conform to existing local authority boundaries, whilst others cover multiple authority areas. Furthermore prior to LTBs being devised government had the idea that perhaps consortia would become establis
[normal]hed, recognising perhaps that a consortium would cross boundaries in the pursuit of a single project or strategy
[normal],
[normal] and presumably could be formed and then dissolved once the task or project had been achieved. The concept of Integrated Transport Authorities 
[normal]is open to Councils under statute 
[normal]and whereas the existing Passenger T
[normal]ransport Authorities have embraced this concept others areas 
[normal](
[normal]notic
[normal]e
[normal]ably in the south of the co
[normal]untry)
[normal] have yet to take this approach.
[normal]Traditionally these proposals often come through the auspices of HA or NR since their projects naturally effect more than one authority. Occasionally and increasingly local autho
[normal]rities take the lead such as the
[normal] examples
[normal] of the
[normal] A14 promoted and 
[normal]coordinated
[normal] by
[normal] Cambridgeshire County Council or the A47 by Norfolk County Council. What seems certain is that considerable engagement needs to take place outside 
[normal]of 
[normal]perhaps the traditional c
[normal]onsultation or even planning mechanisms which may present too much of a 
[normal]formal “atmosphere” for useful dialogue to take place. 
[normal]In Essex use has been made of the Transport Boar
[normal]ds which exist in Thames Gateway, Haven Gateway
[normal] the London-Stansted Gateway
[normal] area
[normal]. Here multiple authority-
[normal] organisations, businesses and other agencies have the opportunity to 
[normal]be 
[normal]part of a strategic approach which then spawns major projects. The collective input helps to raise awareness for the promoting authority and the project itse
[normal]lf gains wider support through this approach.
[normal] The Boards are engagement mechanisms rather than delivery bodies and projects are implemented through partner organisation supply chains with their own internal governance used to ensure both project and democr
[normal]atic accountability
[normal]In the LEP arena, current experience has shown a similar effect to the Transport Boards. 
[normal]Once the first generation of SEPs has been produced there will be a need 
[normal]for 
[normal]cross-LEP discussions on the larger projects. Such discussion for a ha
[normal]ve yet to emerge to consider specific projects although they are in evidence to take on board the influences of ideas and programmes being advanced by neighbouring LEPs.
[normal]It has been Essex’s experience
[normal] that cross-authority, cross-
[normal]LEP and joint working with HA and NR has resulted in good working arrangements which foster a collaborative approach. The experience of the Transport Boards has demo
[normal]nstrated 
[normal]that 
[normal]this
[normal] collaboration
[normal],
[normal] with
[normal] HA in particular
[normal],
[normal] and with DfT
[normal] generally
[normal] has been extremely helpful. Improvements how
[normal]e
[normal]ver need to be made and the areas below are possible candidates for this:
[normal]The current funding being m
[normal]ade available for major projects is greater than that made available in previous comprehensive spending reviews. Although it was disappointing to see the initial allocation reduced with the onset of the 
[normal]LTB/
[normal]SEP, there are signs that 
[normal]all-in-all 
[normal]Local Transp
[normal]ort Authorities will see on average more than the one major scheme per five year average that was 
[normal]inherent in 
[normal]the previous system. In part this is a function of the extra funding being made available and in part this is because six years of funding has bee
[normal]n outlined leading to greater confidence that it is worth the investment in upfront design and planning work prior to impleme
[normal]n
[normal]tation.
[normal]Within this generally favorable landscape however there are some areas which cause local transport authorities genuine 
[normal]concern:
[normal]The impacts foreseen are largely p
[normal]ositive and comprise:
