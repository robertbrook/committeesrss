[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]English Heritage is very mindful of the need for e
[normal]conomic vitality
[normal] in all aspects of its work. Economic sustainability
[normal] is 
[normal]key
[normal] to heritage conservation and heritage makes an important contribution to it. 
[normal]English Heritage consults with business very regularly to understand how to optimise the relationship between 
[normal]viable use of historic places
[normal] and conservation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The planning system is geared towards achieving ‘sustainable development’. This is defined in the National Planning Policy Framework
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]which 
[normal]sets out how heritage conservation should be achieved within a vibrant economy. English Heritage gives all its advice with this objective in mind. It is subject to a duty as part of its funding arrangements with the Department for Culture Media and Sport to promote such sustainable development.
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]English Heritage is 
[normal]also
[normal] 
[normal]obliged to follow
[normal] the Regulators’ Code (under the Regulatory and Legislative Reform Act 2006
[normal])
[normal] and
[normal] guidance issued by the Department for Business Innovation and Skills entitled
[normal] 
[normal]‘
[normal]Accountability for Regulator Impact
[normal]’
[normal]. T
[normal]he
[normal] broad
[normal] aim of
[normal] both
[normal] is
[normal] 
[normal]to ensure that regulators engage with businesses which they affect
[normal] so as to understand the economic
[normal] and other
[normal] impact
[normal]s
[normal] of the way in which they 
[normal]might carry out their functions
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]English Heritage 
[normal]has published a
[normal]n Improvement Plan for Planning Services to minimise adverse impacts on business from our role in the planning system, particularly in terms of costs on key planning projects and development more generally.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]English Heritage’s 
[normal]direct regulatory powers 
[normal]are 
[normal]actually 
[normal]very limited. The use of these powers is very infrequent (one case in the past twelve months)
[normal] and th
[normal]e impact of those regulatory activities
[normal] on the wider economy
[normal] is negligible. 
[normal]English Heritage exercises its influence through advice and guidance to central and local government, principally in the operation of the planning system. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our regular dialogue
[normal] and formal consultation 
[normal]with 
[normal]business is intended to ensure 
[normal]that we are aware of business concerns about our work
[normal]. We obviously understand the connection between business and regulatory efficiency and good conservation outcomes. We work hard to understand the concerns of those whom our advice and guidance affects. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he duty to have regard to growth 
[normal]as it appears in the draft Bill 
[normal]will 
[normal]be in keeping with the 
[normal]considerations English Heritage has always brought to bear in its pursuit of sustainable heritage conservation. It will also be in keeping with 
[normal]existing obligations on English Heritage
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Given the several existing obligations on English Heritage that cover the same territory as the proposed duty, we are concerned by the potential for 
[normal]confusion as to how compliance with each should be achieved and of overlapping reporting requirements. We would be very keen to see 
[normal]consolidation of guidance and reporting obligations as far as possible. 
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Heritage and Growth[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]9
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Conservation of all heritage assets relies, albeit to differing degrees, on ongoing maintenance and therefore ongoing investment. Economic vitality is therefore 
[normal]key
[normal] to the overall success of conservation in England. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our heritage is a major contributor to economic vitality. It provides income to the country through tourism and is frequently the seed-corn of successful, characterful and sustainable regeneration of run-down areas. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The vast majority of heritage assets are in private hands. The conservation of such assets depends on the motivation of the owners, which in large part will be dictated by their own economics. It is therefore vital that all those involved in conservation understand the position of owners, including businesses, and work with them to find constructive ways of conserving heritage assets – ways that sustain the important heritage value of the asset, whilst providing it with a viable use for the medium to long term.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]‘Sustainable Development’, Conservation and Growth[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]12
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The National Planning Policy Framework (the NPPF) provides a definition of ‘sustainable development’ and policies for planning decisions that encapsulates the tie-in between economic vitality and heritage conservation. It thoughtfully sets out the way in which those twin objectives should be sought in 
[normal]a 
[normal]way that maximises the potential for both, whilst minimising conflict.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The NPPF effectively governs a great deal of the work that English Heritage is involved in. Where it does not directly apply as a matter of law, English Heritage still sees its principles as applying as a matter of consistent common sense.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Applying the principles of the NPPF to the work of conservation requires all decision-makers involved in the planning system to be mindful of the objective of heritage regulation and of growth.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]English Heritage’s Engagement with Business[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]15
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It has always been vital to the success of English Heritage’s work that it understands the position and motivations of owners and that
[normal],
[normal] through that
[normal],
[normal] it understands the impact of its activities. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]16
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]English Heritage has very good ongoing relations with representatives of owners and developers across the spectrum of relevant property concerns. Bodies such as the Country Land and Business Association, the British Property Federation and the Historic Houses Association are in very regular contact informally and formally through the Historic Environment Forum. 
[normal]The Chair of English Heritage has frequent meetings with these bodies to ensure that the corporate strategy takes in their concerns. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]They are consulted on all matters of concern to them. They 
[normal]have been 
[normal]active participants in the drafting of guidance to support the NPPF. Business is also represented on the National Heritage Protection Plan (NHPP) Advisory Board. The NHPP is a means by which English Heritage prioritises its areas of work. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]18
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Owners and developers are represented on English Heritage’s governing body (the Commission) and its statutory advisory committees.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]19
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]English Heritage also has its own experience to draw on as the operator of a heritage attraction business covering over 400 properties with a turnover in excess of £50m. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]English Heritage as a Regulator[bold]&#xa0;[bold]20
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]English Heritage’s role in the protection of the historic environment is frequently misunderstood. English Heritage is principally an expert adviser. It is not a decision-maker in the planning system. Its regulatory activities are very limited:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]21
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We currently publish around 15 pieces of general advice and guidance annually and are asked to respond to around 22,000 cases from around the country. From this arises an average of around 50 complaints yearly, of which an average of around 5 turn into a threat of judicial review or JR proceedings. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]22
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]English Heritage is 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]very active in providing advice and guidance to local planning authorities as to the best means of achieving the objectives of the NPPF at the strategic level of making local development plans and on a case-by-case basis. Local planning authorities are bound to take into account such advice in so far as it is in keeping with the NPPF and their existing local development plans. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]23
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As the NPPF and local plans are all directed to the objective of sustainable development, which already has the objectives of growth and heritage conservation (amongst others) written into it, English Heritage’s advice 
[normal]has to be
[normal] mindful of both the conservation and growth impacts. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]24
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]English Heritage is not responsible for any system of compliance. The impact of its regulatory activities is very limited indeed and in the last year has been negligible.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The [bold]Regulators’ Code 2013[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]25
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]English Heritage is subject to the Regulators’ Code 2013. 
[normal]This sets out the guidance on how regulators have regard to the Code when developing policies and operational procedures that guide their regulatory activities. In particular:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]26
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Th
[normal]ese are actions 
[normal]that 
[normal]English Heritage wholeheartedly supports
[normal] not only because they are obvious actions to support successful heritage conservation
[normal],
[normal] but 
[normal]also 
[normal]because they reinforce
[normal] the balanced definition of sustainable development within the NPPF.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]27
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]For 
[normal]nine
[normal] years we have
[normal] publish
[normal]ed
[normal] a Charter 
[normal]for Planning Services 
[normal](now in its 5
[normal]th
[normal] edition) 
[normal]which
[normal] sets out the service provided by English Heritage for those involved in changing or influencing change to the historic environment. It explains how we handle requests for pre-application and statutory advice; it covers our advice on matters of policy and management issues relevant to the planning process; and it explains our engagement, in partnership with others, in the modernised planning system.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The value and impact of a new statutory duty to have regard to growth[bold]&#xa0;[bold]28
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Given the several existing obligations on English Heritage that cover the same territory as the proposed duty, we are concerned by the potential for confusion as to how compliance with each should be achieved and of overlapping reporting requirements. We would be very keen to see consolidation of guidance and reporting obligations as far as possible. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]29
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We also have residual concerns about how the duty 
[normal]may
[normal] be perceived. As drafted it should not impede the primary statutory objectives of English Heritage’s work. However, if the wording 
[normal]was 
[normal]changed or
[normal] if
[normal] the supporting guidance altered the interpretation and the result was 
[normal]an unresolved potential conflict between the primary regulatory objectives and the growth duty, then there could be considerable implications for the work of English Heritage and challenges to it. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In answer to the specific questions on the Deregulation Bill[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Questions[bold]&#xa0;[bold]General[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1. The draft Bill covers a broad range of specific activities and a large amount of legislative provision is amended by it. Could the same result have been achieved using existing secondary legislative procedures? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]See comments above regarding existing obligations that achieve similar objectives. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of including specific deregulatory provisions amending existing legislation and providing additional or amended order making powers within primary legislation rather than considering them through existing deregulatory mechanisms? 
[normal]              
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. Are the changes proposed in the draft Bill evidence-based and have any risks associated with the changes been taken adequately into account? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. Does the draft Bill achieve its purpose of reducing the regulatory burden on business, organisations and individuals effectively and fairly?
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]See comments above. We do not believe it will materially
[normal] alter
[normal] the 
[normal]effect
[normal] of English Heritage’s advice and guidance as the economic impact of such is already well considered
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. Will the draft Bill generally benefit businesses by offsetting other regulatory burdens? Are there indirect impacts on other businesses from reducing regulation in specific sectors? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6. To what extent does the draft Bill benefit consumers as well as businesses? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7. How does the provision in the draft Bill affect: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]i
[normal]. protections afforded to individuals under human rights and equalities legislation? 
[normal]ii
[normal]. employment law, skills and the labour market? 
[normal]iii
[normal]. the environment, particularly in the management of waste? 
[normal]iv. 
[normal]the
[normal] provision of education? 
[normal]v
[normal]. the effective administration of justice? 
[normal]vi. 
[normal]social
[normal], wellbeing or health inequalities? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8. Have the measures set out in the draft Bill been subject to adequate cost-benefit analysis on the basis of consultation with those affected? 
[normal]              
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9. Will any or all of the proposals have any significant economic or financial impact? Do you have any evidence of the impact that will aid the Committee in their scrutiny? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Power to disapply legislation no longer of practical use [bold]10. Is a new “power to disapply legislation no longer of practical use” necessary or are there existing procedures which could be used to achieve the same effect?” 
[normal](Clause 51)?
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11. Is the 
[normal]meaning of the phrase “no longer of practical use” clear
[normal]? In this context, what is meant by “practical”? 
[normal]Should it be defined and, if so, how?
[normal] Will removing any of the provision proposed in Schedule 16 of the draft Bill have implications for any other areas of regulation? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12. Are the safeguards regarding the use of the “no longer of practical use” power (set out in Clauses 54 to 56) adequate and appropriate? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13. Other deregulatory mechanisms such as Legislative Reform Orders or Public Bodies Orders have specific tests set out in the parent Act - should there be similar tests set out in the draft Bill? What should they be? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14. Are the mechanisms set out for parliamentary oversight (Clauses 55 and 56) of deregulation orders adequate and appropriate? 
[normal]              
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15. Are there other changes to deregulatory powers, procedures and parliamentary oversight which you think should have been included in the Bill and, if so, why?
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]16. What are the risks associated with the proposed new power to disapply legislation that is “no longer of practical use”? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A duty to have regard to the desirability of promoting economic growth [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]17. To what extent do the Government’s existing powers of direction over regulators already provide the ability to guide regulators towards the importance of promoting economic growth? Is this legislation necessary? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]See comments above. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]18. Will the introduction of a duty to have 
[normal]regard
[normal] to “promoting economic growth” compromise the independence of regulators? What additional safeguards are required to ensure that the introduction of such a duty will not compromise the independence of a regulator? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]See comments above. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]19. How is a duty to have regard to the desirability of economic growth likely to affect those regulators to which it is applied? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]We believe it will impact where there is more than one way of achieving satisfactory compliance. In such circumstances it is obviously important to understand which means of regulation would be the least burdensome and the most supportive of growth. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]As commented above, understanding the impact of heritage guidance is fundamental to achieving successful conservation. It is also part of existing compliance and reporting regimes to which English Heritage is subject. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]20. Where is the introduction of such a duty likely to have beneficial effect? Where might there be adverse consequences? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]See comments above. Provided the duty is interpreted as we understand it at present and the guidance on how to comply and reporting regimes are 
[normal]consolidated and harmonised with similar requirements already in existence, the impact should be neutral.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]21. How might the extent to which a regulator has fulfilled, or breached, the duty be ascertained? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]See comments above. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]22. How can the likely financial and economic impact of the proposed duty be assessed? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Devolution [bold]23. What are the consequences of the draft Bill for the devolved administrations? 
[normal]&#xa0;
