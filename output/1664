[normal]1. [bold]Summary[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]This evidence  focuses on the utilisation of energy storage and 
[normal]contends that whilst there is recognition within some government circles of the potential  advantages of  thermal storage , there are few incentives commercially or at consumer level to encourage development or take-up of existing technologies. This eviden
[normal]ce   
[normal]concentrates on one particular technology, Smart Electric Thermal Storage (SETS). SETS allows the one-way storage of renewable energy as heat, which can then be used for space heating and hot water at a later point in time.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]SETS is a potential 
[normal]“drop-in” replacement technology for the current
[normal] 
[normal]2.4 million
[normal] homes  in 
[normal]t
[normal]he UK
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]that are electrically heated
[normal] 
[normal]. 
[normal]SETS can be used to provide decentralised space heating and hot water, and can act as an energy storage system to provide distributed flexibility 
[normal]to the electricity grid. It can drive down ener
[normal]gy bills as a result of up to 22
[normal]% efficiency gains compared to current night storage heaters. Its demand side management functionality also brings flexibility to the energy system by storing heat from renewabl
[normal]e electricity generated at times of high supply and low demand. SETS is fully 
[normal]controllable and designed for integration into smart grid control systems. It can contribute to accommodating the increasing penetration of renewable resources 
[normal]not just in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] but 
[normal]across the EU-27. SETS highest storage potential will be achieved during seasonal periods where (space) heating demand is the highest. Its grid services have considerable potential in cutting peak consumption and emissions, as well as reducing the str
[normal]ess on the electricity distribution and generation system.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]All future energy scenarios anticipate increased penetration of renewable energy, with an associated increase in distributed generation. Distributed storage technologies will become critical to ac
[normal]commodate the fluctuating supply of renewable energy and assist in balancing the grid. SETS can provide multiple services to the electricity system, bringing with it multiple benefits such as grid optimisation and better use of capacity.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]SETS is mainly in
[normal]tended to replace traditional nig
[normal]ht storage heaters of which there are currently
[normal] 
[normal]6.0million  in current use in the UK, and Electric Domestic hot water cylinders, of which there are 2.1million  
[normal] If the UK 
[normal] replaced the current installed base of night storag
[normal]e
[normal] heaters
[normal] and water cylinders 
[normal], SETS could provide 19.3
[normal]GW of
[normal] controllable demand by 2050 (
[normal]6.3
[normal] GW
[normal] for hot water and
[normal] 
[normal]13 
[normal]GW 
[normal]for 
[normal] Night
[normal] 
[normal] Storage Heaters systems. This replacement would a
[normal]lso result in a carbon saving of 1.26
[normal] Mton per year.

[normal]2[bold].[bold] Introduction[bold] SETS can help to supply and store heat in electrically heated houses. SETS facilitates the decoupling of energy production from energy consumption, so that renewable energy can be converted into heat and offering control over when this heat is released. G
[normal]len Dimplex and SSE 
[normal]( Formerly Scottish and Southern Energy )
[normal]have taken a pro-active role regarding SETS, as they have developed the first market-ready SETS product, the Quantum Space Heating and Water Heating System.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1 Technology perspective[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Essential
[normal]ly, SETS is a decentralised heating, hot water and energy storage system. It is a heating and hot water solution for customers that can drive
[normal] down energy bills with up to 22
[normal]% efficiency gains compared to traditional night storage heaters. At the same time 
[normal]it offers sizeable storage functionality to the energy system, enabling the storage of heat generated from renewable electricity at times of high supply and low demand and providing load control for the system operator at distribution level. It consists of
[normal] electric space heating radiators, with an insulated thermal mass for storing, and a 
[normal] separate 
[normal]hot water cylinder. An example of SETS is the Quantum system.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]SETS is a form of electric heating, converting electrical energy into heat. At a basic level, SETS
[normal] is based on the existing technology of night storage heaters, designed to reduce the large differences in peak and off-peak electricity demand. Traditional night storage heaters have a medium that is heated during the night, and releases that heat during 
[normal]the day. SETS is more 
[normal]flexible and allows the medium to be charged at any time, to suit electricity grid conditions, and offers customers control over the release of this heat, see figure 2.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]SETS includes advanced electronic command and control capabil
[normal]ities such as an automated input control with adaptive learning function to determine how much heat will be needed on a particular day, while accounting for prevailing weather conditions. This Daily Energy Requirement is calculated using an algorithm based
[normal] on the residual stored energy, the rate of change in room temperature after the evening heating period, as well as user-programmed hea
[normal]ting requirements. SETS uses Information and Communication technologies 
[normal] to enable flexible tariff regimes, to support th
[normal]e integration of renewable energy resources at any time, allowing Time of Use tariff schemes to be integrated in the 
[normal]operation of SETS.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2[bold] System perspective[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]SETS is not only designed as a heater, but also as a storage medium. The storage functionality
[normal] of SETS must be viewed from an energy system perspective and can be summarised as increased control and decreased carbon usage.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]When accounting for the system services of SETS it must be noted that it is designed for periods of high renewable energy prod
[normal]uction. However, the heat demand will depend on the customer heating requirement, as well as the incidence of periods of low renewable energy production and therefore the need for dispatchable capacity. However, SETS does not offer bi-directional storage o
[normal]f electricity; the 
[normal]electricity stored as heat, can
[normal]not be re-injected as
[normal]electrical power into the grid.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Finally, the space heating requirements are significantly influenced by seasonal temperature fluctuations, impacting the available control of power flows. During Spring and Autumn, the available control is expected to remain, but with shorter durations. Du
[normal]ring summer, it is estimated that there is no 
[normal]space heating requirement, and only the hot water cylinder is available for system control, effectively reducing the available control capacity.
[normal] However  it is estimated that the daily storage capacity offered 
[normal]by these systems  in winter in the UK  will be 110GWh, and in the summer, when night storage heaters are no longer in use
[normal],
[normal] the daily storage capacity will still be 21GW
[normal]h
[normal] from the cylinders.
[normal] This compares very favourably with the pumped storage capacity of 
[normal]Dinorwig, which  at only 11 GWh  is  the UK’s largest pumped storage. In fact  the winter daily storage capacity of SETS in the UK is more than 4 times greater than all the pumped storage capacity the UK  currently has.

[normal]3.3 [bold] System Control[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Energy st
[normal]orage brings flexibility to the energy system
[normal] 
[normal]so it can deal with sudden changes in renewable
[normal] 
[normal]energy output. At the moment fossil 
[normal]fuelled
[normal] power
[normal] 
[normal]plants offer this flexibility. However, this reduces their
[normal] 
[normal]efficiency, and the continued carbon emissions do not
[normal] 
[normal]fit with the Low Carbon Roadmap
[normal] to
[normal] 2050. Storage can
[normal] 
[normal]offer a part of this flexibility as well. In cataloguing
[normal] 
[normal]and categorising electricity storage technologies,
[normal] 
[normal]the power rating and response time is as relevant as
[normal] 
[normal]the energy rating in kWh. Fast ramping up
[normal]/down of
[normal] 
[normal]electricity consumption can add flexibility to the grid.
[normal] 
[normal]Heat storage can play a role in providing this flexibility
[normal] 
[normal]to the electricity grid on all levels, see F
[normal]igure 4
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3.2 Carbon [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The effect of SETS on carbon emissions is primarily a result 
[normal]of energy savings. SETS can reduce heatin
[normal]g energy consumption by up to 22
[normal]%, compared to traditional night storage heaters. A typical night storage heater will operate for 200 days a year, with 5 hours of charging, resulting in annual energy savings of 1.60
[normal]0 kWh per household, equatin
[normal]g to 600 kg CO2 per year. R
[normal]eplacing all night storage heaters
[normal] in the UK 
[normal]wou
[normal]ld result in a carbon saving of 1.26Mton o
[normal]f carbon  
[normal]Secondly SETS allows a larger penetration of renewable electricity in a distribution grid, by offeri
[normal]ng a source of flexibility. This enabling characteristic of SETS allows the overall carbon intensity of the energy mix to be reduced.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]SETS is recognised in DECC
[normal]’
[normal]s March 2012 document “ The Future of Heating: A strategic framework  for low carbon heat in
[normal] the UK “ as one of the
[normal] desirable 
[normal] low carbon and energy storage  technologies available.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Overall we contend that policies and new market mechanisms  should be deve
[normal]loped  to support distributed flexibility services  of which SETS  is an example. SETS  has
[normal] the potential to be a contributor to the flexible low carbon  energy storage systems of the future.
