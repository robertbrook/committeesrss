default1. defaultSummarydefault&#xa0;
defaultThis evidence  focuses on the utilisation of energy storage and 
defaultcontends that whilst there is recognition within some government circles of the potential  advantages of  thermal storage , there are few incentives commercially or at consumer level to encourage development or take-up of existing technologies. This eviden
defaultce   
defaultconcentrates on one particular technology, Smart Electric Thermal Storage (SETS). SETS allows the one-way storage of renewable energy as heat, which can then be used for space heating and hot water at a later point in time.
default&#xa0;
defaultSETS is a potential 
default“drop-in” replacement technology for the current
default 
default2.4 million
default homes  in 
defaultt
defaulthe UK
default 
default 
defaultthat are electrically heated
default 
default. 
defaultSETS can be used to provide decentralised space heating and hot water, and can act as an energy storage system to provide distributed flexibility 
defaultto the electricity grid. It can drive down ener
defaultgy bills as a result of up to 22
default% efficiency gains compared to current night storage heaters. Its demand side management functionality also brings flexibility to the energy system by storing heat from renewabl
defaulte electricity generated at times of high supply and low demand. SETS is fully 
defaultcontrollable and designed for integration into smart grid control systems. It can contribute to accommodating the increasing penetration of renewable resources 
defaultnot just in the 
defaultUK
default but 
defaultacross the EU-27. SETS highest storage potential will be achieved during seasonal periods where (space) heating demand is the highest. Its grid services have considerable potential in cutting peak consumption and emissions, as well as reducing the str
defaultess on the electricity distribution and generation system.
default&#xa0;
defaultAll future energy scenarios anticipate increased penetration of renewable energy, with an associated increase in distributed generation. Distributed storage technologies will become critical to ac
defaultcommodate the fluctuating supply of renewable energy and assist in balancing the grid. SETS can provide multiple services to the electricity system, bringing with it multiple benefits such as grid optimisation and better use of capacity.
default&#xa0;
defaultSETS is mainly in
defaulttended to replace traditional nig
defaultht storage heaters of which there are currently

default2default.default Introductiondefault SETS can help to supply and store heat in electrically heated houses. SETS facilitates the decoupling of energy production from energy consumption, so that renewable energy can be converted into heat and offering control over when this heat is released. G
defaultlen Dimplex and SSE 
default( Formerly Scottish and Southern Energy )
defaulthave taken a pro-active role regarding SETS, as they have developed the first market-ready SETS product, the Quantum Space Heating and Water Heating System.
default&#xa0;
default3.1 Technology perspectivedefault&#xa0;
defaultEssential
defaultly, SETS is a decentralised heating, hot water and energy storage system. It is a heating and hot water solution for customers that can drive
default down energy bills with up to 22
default% efficiency gains compared to traditional night storage heaters. At the same time 
defaultit offers sizeable storage functionality to the energy system, enabling the storage of heat generated from renewable electricity at times of high supply and low demand and providing load control for the system operator at distribution level. It consists of
default electric space heating radiators, with an insulated thermal mass for storing, and a 
default separate 
defaulthot water cylinder. An example of SETS is the Quantum system.
default&#xa0;
defaultSETS is a form of electric heating, converting electrical energy into heat. At a basic level, SETS
default is based on the existing technology of night storage heaters, designed to reduce the large differences in peak and off-peak electricity demand. Traditional night storage heaters have a medium that is heated during the night, and releases that heat during 
defaultthe day. SETS is more 
defaultflexible and allows the medium to be charged at any time, to suit electricity grid conditions, and offers customers control over the release of this heat, see figure 2.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultSETS includes advanced electronic command and control capabil
defaultities such as an automated input control with adaptive learning function to determine how much heat will be needed on a particular day, while accounting for prevailing weather conditions. This Daily Energy Requirement is calculated using an algorithm based
default on the residual stored energy, the rate of change in room temperature after the evening heating period, as well as user-programmed hea
defaultting requirements. SETS uses Information and Communication technologies 
default to enable flexible tariff regimes, to support th
defaulte integration of renewable energy resources at any time, allowing Time of Use tariff schemes to be integrated in the 
defaultoperation of SETS.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.2default System perspectivedefault&#xa0;
defaultSETS is not only designed as a heater, but also as a storage medium. The storage functionality
default of SETS must be viewed from an energy system perspective and can be summarised as increased control and decreased carbon usage.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhen accounting for the system services of SETS it must be noted that it is designed for periods of high renewable energy prod
defaultuction. However, the heat demand will depend on the customer heating requirement, as well as the incidence of periods of low renewable energy production and therefore the need for dispatchable capacity. However, SETS does not offer bi-directional storage o
defaultf electricity; the 
defaultelectricity stored as heat, can
defaultnot be re-injected as
defaultelectrical power into the grid.
default&#xa0;
defaultFinally, the space heating requirements are significantly influenced by seasonal temperature fluctuations, impacting the available control of power flows. During Spring and Autumn, the available control is expected to remain, but with shorter durations. Du
defaultring summer, it is estimated that there is no 
defaultspace heating requirement, and only the hot water cylinder is available for system control, effectively reducing the available control capacity.
default However  it is estimated that the daily storage capacity offered 
defaultby these systems  in winter in the UK  will be 110GWh, and in the summer, when night storage heaters are no longer in use
default,
default the daily storage capacity will still be 21GW
defaulth
default from the cylinders.
default This compares very favourably with the pumped storage capacity of 
defaultDinorwig, which  at only 11 GWh  is  the UK’s largest pumped storage. In fact  the winter daily storage capacity of SETS in the UK is more than 4 times greater than all the pumped storage capacity the UK  currently has.

default3.3 default System Controldefault&#xa0;
defaultEnergy st
defaultorage brings flexibility to the energy system
default 
defaultso it can deal with sudden changes in renewable
default 
defaultenergy output. At the moment fossil 
defaultfuelled
default power
default 
defaultplants offer this flexibility. However, this reduces their
default 
defaultefficiency, and the continued carbon emissions do not
default 
defaultfit with the Low Carbon Roadmap
default to
default 2050. Storage can
default 
defaultoffer a part of this flexibility as well. In cataloguing
default 
defaultand categorising electricity storage technologies,
default 
defaultthe power rating and response time is as relevant as
default 
defaultthe energy rating in kWh. Fast ramping up
default/down of
default 
defaultelectricity consumption can add flexibility to the grid.
default 
defaultHeat storage can play a role in providing this flexibility
default 
defaultto the electricity grid on all levels, see F
defaultigure 4
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.3.2 Carbon default&#xa0;
defaultThe effect of SETS on carbon emissions is primarily a result 
defaultof energy savings. SETS can reduce heatin
defaultg energy consumption by up to 22
default%, compared to traditional night storage heaters. A typical night storage heater will operate for 200 days a year, with 5 hours of charging, resulting in annual energy savings of 1.60
default0 kWh per household, equatin
defaultg to 600 kg CO2 per year. R
defaulteplacing all night storage heaters
default in the UK 
defaultwou
defaultld result in a carbon saving of 1.26Mton o
defaultf carbon  
defaultSecondly SETS allows a larger penetration of renewable electricity in a distribution grid, by offeri
defaultng a source of flexibility. This enabling characteristic of SETS allows the overall carbon intensity of the energy mix to be reduced.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultSETS is recognised in DECC
default’
defaults March 2012 document “ The Future of Heating: A strategic framework  for low carbon heat in
default the UK “ as one of the
default desirable 
default low carbon and energy storage  technologies available.
default&#xa0;
defaultOverall we contend that policies and new market mechanisms  should be deve
defaultloped  to support distributed flexibility services  of which SETS  is an example. SETS  has
default the potential to be a contributor to the flexible low carbon  energy storage systems of the future.
