[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Executive Summary[bold]This report 
[normal]shows 
[normal]that, 
[normal]d
[normal]espite individual successe
[normal]s
[normal], academies 
[normal]overall 
[normal]have 
[normal]done little to narrow the gap for
[normal] 
[normal]disadvantaged pupils.

[normal]to question assumptions that GNVQ Intermediate, and subsequently BTEC, is worth four C grades at GCSE. 
[normal]Consequentl
[normal]y it would be misleading to assume that academy status provides a solution for low achieving primary schools. 
[normal]Rather, 
[normal]these schools 
[normal]should 
[normal]be assisted to improve professional understanding and practice, develop meaningful curriculum, enrich children’s expe
[normal]rience, raise confidence and self-esteem, and relate more to parents and communities.  
[normal]Officially c[bold]ommissioned research[bold]1)
[normal]Official
[normal] evaluations were conducted annu
[normal]ally by PwC (published 2004-
[normal]8, based on the previous summer’s 
[normal]exams
[normal]). Even when 
[normal]the exploita
[normal]tion
[normal] of alternatives
[normal] 
[normal]to GCSE had become a public scandal, PwC reports continued to take 
[normal]‘
[normal]equivalence
[normal]’
[normal] at face value. 
[normal]Moveover
[normal], whilst recognizing 
[normal]th
[normal]at th
[normal]e
[normal] 
[normal]proportion
[normal] 
[normal]of
[normal] disadvantaged pupils
[normal] had reduced
[normal], 
[normal]these
[normal] reports
[normal] failed to factor this into calculation
[normal]s
[normal] on attainment and improvement
[normal]. 
[normal]Even so, the later reports raise
[normal]d 
[normal]some 
[normal]serious doubts
[normal], concluding
[normal] that ‘
[normal]rather than a simple uniform Academy effect, there has been a more comple
[normal]x and varied process of change.’
[normal] 
[normal]The
[normal] 
[normal]final
[normal] 
[normal](2008) 
[normal]report recommended that acad
[normal]emies should report attainment for sub-groups of pupils such as FSM or EAL.

[normal]Comparisons
[normal] with the predecessor school in the 
[normal]month before
[normal] closure
[normal], often 
[normal]affected by
[normal] 
[normal]demoralisation
[normal], also 
[normal]exaggered
[normal] improvement claims
[normal]; 
[normal]comparisons 
[normal]with earlier years
[normal] would h
[normal]ave been more 
[normal]valid
[normal]. 
[normal]3
[normal]) 
[normal]The 
[normal]2007 National Audit Office report
[normal] 
[normal]had similar flaws
[normal]. 
[normal]Nevertheless
[normal], 
[normal]hidden 
[normal]behind the 
[normal]positive style and presentation
[normal], it
[normal] 
[normal]conceded 
[normal]that academy stat
[normal]us had had less impact than 
[normal]other 
[normal]programmes
[normal] such as
[normal] Excellence in Cities. 
[normal]One
[normal] chart showed that academies 
[normal]had 
[normal]improved no faster than the predecessor schools had in the three years 
[normal]before
[normal] closure
[normal]. 
[normal]4
[normal]) 
[normal]The 
[normal]2010 
[normal]National Audit Office report
[normal] 
[normal]admitted an inability
[normal] to identify 
[normal]which features of academies might be causing improvement
[normal] (p2
[normal]0)
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]simply
[normal] 
[normal]wide variations
[normal] (p18). I
[normal]mproved attainment had
[normal] not come from 
[normal]academies’
[normal] 
[normal]disadvantaged pupils  
[normal](
[normal]pp27-8);
[normal]  
[normal]in fact the gap had risen (p6).
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he apparent success of academies 
[normal]depended
[normal] largely 
[normal]on alternative qualifications (pp21-2).
[normal] 
[normal]5
[normal]) 
[normal]The most rece
[normal]nt official report 
[normal](
[normal]Rutt
[normal] and Styles
[normal], NFER
[normal], 2013
[normal]) 
[normal]also
[normal] acknowledged
[normal] that academies’ success depends substantially on 
[normal]‘
[normal]equivalents
[normal]’
[normal]. 
[normal]It 
[normal]concluded
[normal] that
[normal], for
[normal] 
[normal]GCSE-only data 
[normal]without
[normal] ‘equivalents’, 
[normal]academy 
[normal]pupils made less progress 
[normal]between KS2 and
[normal] KS4
[normal].
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]6
[normal]) 
[normal]Most of the 
[normal]commissioned 
[normal]research has been flawed
[normal] because it failed to take into account the exceptionally high use of alternative qualifications (‘equivalents’) 
[normal]or
[normal] the reduction in disadvantage. 
[normal] 
[normal]‘

[normal] 
[normal]7
[normal]) 
[normal]In order to
[normal] 
[normal]encourage
[normal] vocational qualifi
[normal]cations 
[normal]in a 
[normal]target-driven
[normal] 
[normal]school system
[normal], they had to be
[normal] 
[normal]matched
[normal] with 
[normal]GCSE grades
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]In the process, c
[normal]onsiderable distortion
[normal] was 
[normal]created
[normal] by declaring
[normal] that GNVQ 
[normal]Intermediate 
[normal]equate
[normal]d
[normal] 
[normal]in quality
[normal] to a C
[normal] grade
[normal], and, 
[normal]in quantity
[normal], that 
[normal]one 
[normal]GNVQ 
[normal]was
[normal] worth
[normal] four [bold]times[bold] as much[bold] as a GCSE
[normal]. 
[normal](From now
[normal], I use GNVQ as shorthand for GNVQ Intermediate.
[normal] 
[normal]GNVQ has 
[normal]since 
[normal]been replaced but the
[normal] prob
[normal]lem 
[normal]repeated
[normal] 
[normal]with
[normal] BTEC
[normal]s
[normal].
[normal])
[normal]8
[normal]) 
[normal]Given 
[normal]that 
[normal]‘
[normal]five or more A*-C grades
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal]w
[normal]as 
[normal]the key 
[normal]performance 
[normal]indicator
[normal], this 
[normal]enabled
[normal] schools to 
[normal]substitute 
[normal]one GCSE plus one GNVQ
[normal] for five GCSEs
[normal]. 
[normal]Academies have exploited this far more than other schools. 
[normal]Even 
[normal]when it was decided
[normal] that 
[normal]this
[normal] 
[normal]should include English and 
[normal]Maths
[normal], schools 
[normal]were able 
[normal]to count English, 
[normal]Maths
[normal] and 
[normal]one 
[normal]GNVQ as five GCSEs. G
[normal]NVQs were eventual
[normal]ly phased out but
[normal] the 1=4 problem 
[normal]continued
[normal] with
[normal] BTEC. 
[normal]9
[normal]) 
[normal]The problem was evident from
[normal] the 
[normal]start. M
[normal]any pupils 
[normal]in the 
[normal]earliest
[normal] academies 
[normal]were 
[normal]categorised
[normal] as 
[normal]‘
[normal]five A*-Cs
[normal]’
[normal] on the basis of a GNVQ in computing plus a grade C in art or PE
[normal], for example
[normal]. This 
[normal]would no
[normal]t
[normal] count as success
[normal]ful secondary education
[normal] in other European countries. 
[normal]Although the 
[normal]inclusion of
[normal] English and 
[normal]Maths
[normal] 
[normal]made
[normal] the indicator
[normal] more reliable
[normal], pupils 
[normal]with English, 
[normal]Maths
[normal] and one other subject 
[normal]continued to 
[normal]classify 
[normal]as 
[normal]successfully 
[normal]educated. Ac
[normal]ademies in particular expanded the teaching time for English and 
[normal]Maths
[normal] and 
[normal]narrowed the
[normal] curriculum.
[normal]10
[normal]) 
[normal]Enquiries 
[normal]revealed that
[normal] 
[normal]even 
[normal]Ofs
[normal]ted 
[normal]had made
[normal] no attempt 
[normal]to 
[normal]ascertain whether the 
[normal]‘
[normal]equivalence
[normal]’
[normal] was well founded, 
[normal]in terms of quality
[normal] (C equivalence) or 
[normal]quantity (
[normal]1=4
[normal]). 
[normal]My
[normal] investigation showed that half of pupils passing GNVQ Science, supposedly 
[normal]worth
[normal] C or above
[normal] at GCSE
[normal], 
[normal]only 
[normal]obtained D or E grades in GCSE 
[normal]Maths
[normal]; b
[normal]y comparison, over 90% of pupils 
[normal]with
[normal] a C or above in GCSE Science achieve
[normal]d
[normal] a C or above in 
[normal]G
[normal]CSE 
[normal]Maths
[normal]. 
[normal]The result was similar when 
[normal]GNVQ 
[normal]Computing was compared with GCSE 
[normal]Maths
[normal]. 
[normal]11
[normal]) 
[normal]Substituting
[normal] spuriously ‘equivalent’ qualifications is damaging to pupils for various reasons. They 
[normal]probably
[normal] have less 
[normal]‘street value’ than GCSEs, both in terms of 
[normal]employmen
[normal]t and continuing education, and
[normal] provide a poorer foundation for A-level. 
[normal] 
[normal]Changing pupil populations
[normal]12
[normal]) 
[normal]Whatever the reasons, it
[normal] is statistically irrefutable that
[normal] 
[normal]poverty 
[normal]is associated with
[normal] lower
[normal] academic achievement
[normal]. One imperfect but 
[normal]convenien
[normal]t
[normal] measure of poverty is free school meal
[normal] entitlement
[normal] (FSM). T
[normal]he statistics show that FSM pupils are only 
[normal]half as likely
[normal] to achieve five or more A*-Cs or equivalent 
[normal]with 
[normal]English and 
[normal]Maths
[normal]. 
[normal](In 2011, the off
[normal]icial measure of disadvantage
[normal] was expanded to inclu
[normal]de looked-after children, 
[normal]though statistically 
[normal]thes
[normal]e are few of these compared to FSM
[normal].)
[normal]13
[normal]) 
[normal]Some of the 
[normal]early
[normal] 
[normal]academies 
[normal]vigorously 
[normal]removed
[normal] pupils who 
[normal]seemed
[normal] 
[normal]un
[normal]likely to achieve five A*-Cs
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]even with
[normal] equivalents
[normal]. Some academies excluded l
[normal]arge numbers 
[normal]of pup
[normal]ils
[normal],
[normal] or p encou
[normal]rag
[normal]ed 
[normal]parents 
[normal]to take their children elsewhere
[normal] to avoid exclusion
[normal]. In
[normal] other cases, 
[normal]expensive school uniform 
[normal]drove poorer families away
[normal]. 
[normal]O
[normal]ne of
[normal] the first 12 academies 
[normal]reduced its FSM pupils from 51% to 11%; 
[normal]the
[normal] sports 
[normal]equipment
[normal] alone
[normal] cost £130
[normal] and 
[normal]families were told
[normal] 
[normal]that
[normal] computers with broadband
[normal] were required
[normal].  
[normal]Th
[normal]ough th
[normal]is was an extreme case, 
[normal]many academies 
[normal]substantially 
[normal]reduced
[normal] the proportion of FSM pupils. 
[normal]14
[normal]) 
[normal]In other cases, the change in pupil population was achieved through exp
[normal]ansion: the academy was able to 
[normal]attract 
[normal]new pupils from outside its traditional catchment
[normal], partly as a result of impressive new buildings
[normal]. Parents 
[normal]who 
[normal]deliberately 
[normal]change their child’s school
[normal] 
[normal]are
[normal] likely 
[normal]to be supportive and 
[normal]aspirational
[normal]. T
[normal]his is impossible
[normal] to register statistically. However, whe
[normal]n
[normal] 
[normal]additional pupils are non-
[normal]FSM, one 
[normal]can 
[normal]reasonably
[normal] 
[normal]expect them
[normal] to 
[normal]be as successful
[normal] as non-FSM pupils nationally: it is 
[normal]inappropriate 
[normal]to 
[normal]continue 
[normal]compar
[normal]ing
[normal] the academy’s results with those of the predecessor schools 
[normal]as if the pupil population w
[normal]ere
[normal] 
[normal]unchanged
[normal]. 
[normal]15
[normal]) 
[normal]Official evaluations, while recording the 
[normal]fall 
[normal]in FSM pupils
[normal], have failed to factor this in
[normal]to their 
[normal]evaluations of attainment, i.e.
[normal] they 
[normal]have not 
[normal]compar
[normal]ed
[normal] like with like
[normal], falsely attributing improved performa
[normal]nce to academy governance
[normal]. 
[normal]16
[normal]) 
[normal]It should also be noted that
[normal], by around 2007,
[normal] 
[normal]more 
[normal]schools with modest levels of disadvantage 
[normal]were becoming
[normal] academies
[normal], and the
[normal] prior 
[normal](KS2) 
[normal]attainment 
[normal]of academy entrants was rising towards the
[normal] national 
[normal]average
[normal].  
[normal]My own [bold]research[bold]: emerging problems[bold]17
[normal]) 
[normal]Drawing on official data, 
[normal]my research has
[normal] 
[normal]scrutinised
[normal] 
[normal]attainment figures
[normal] 
[normal]regularly
[normal] 
[normal]from 2006 to 2012
[normal]. Like 
[normal]PwC, I 
[normal]consistently 
[normal]excluded academies in their first year of operation, as 
[normal]one can 
[normal]scarcely
[normal] ascribe GCSE results 
[normal]sat
[normal] in June to the 
[normal]fact that the pupils’ school has
[normal] been 
[normal]an academy for 10 months. 
[normal]U
[normal]nlike
[normal] PwC and 
[normal]most 
[normal]other officially commissioned evaluations, I have attempted to take into account the impact of Academies’ heavy use of 
[normal]alternative
[normal] qualifications. 
[normal]In 
[normal]one st
[normal]udy
[normal] I 
[normal]estimated
[normal] how much of an academy’s apparent improvement 
[normal]results from
[normal] having fewer disadvantaged pupils than 
[normal]its
[normal] 
[normal]predecessor school.  
[normal]18
[normal]) 
[normal]Since
[normal] GCSE results 
[normal]across England have increased annually,
[normal] 
[normal]I have adjusted 
[normal]the r
[normal]aw data 
[normal]for academies and 
[normal]non-academies
[normal] alike
[normal] in order to measure real improvement.
[normal] 
[normal](
[normal]This is 
[normal]rather 
[normal]like 
[normal]an economist explaining
[normal] what £100 in 1990 is worth 
[normal]‘
[normal]in today’s money
[normal]’
[normal].
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]19
[normal]) 
[normal]My research began with the 
[normal]June 
[normal]2005 results
[normal], i.e. 
[normal]the 12 
[normal]academies which opened in September 2002 
[normal]o
[normal]r 
[normal]2003. 
[normal]It
[normal] was already apparent
[normal] that official claims were 
[normal]misleading
[normal]: t
[normal]he dramatic increase in five A*-Cs 
[normal]‘
[normal]or equivalent
[normal]’
[normal] was almost entirely due to non-GCSE 
[normal]certificates
[normal]. 
[normal]One indicator was
[normal] how many pupils 
[normal]actually 
[normal]had 
[normal]C or ‘equivalent’ 
[normal]qualifications in f
[normal]ive or more 
[normal]subjects
[normal]. 
[normal]2002 predecessor schools
[normal]:
[normal] 
[normal]24% 
[normal]shown as 
[normal]5 or more A*-Cs 
[normal]‘
[normal]or equivalent
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal]whilst 
[normal]20% qualified in five or more subjects. 
[normal]              
[normal]2005 academies
[normal]:
[normal] 37% 
[normal]shown as 
[normal]5 or more A*-Cs 
[normal]‘
[normal]or equivalent
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal]whilst 
[normal]only 
[normal]22
[normal]% qualified in five or more subjects.

[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]In other words, very little 
[normal]real 
[normal]improvement
[normal] (20% to 22%)
[normal]. 
[normal]E
[normal]mphasis was beginning to be placed on the inclusion of English and 
[normal]Maths
[normal], but
[normal] this 
[normal]also showed very little improvement
[normal] - 
[normal]from 14% 
[normal]in 
[normal]2002 to 15% 
[normal]in 
[normal]2005.
[normal]A
[normal]cademies did considerably better a
[normal]t English and 
[normal]Maths
[normal] 
[normal]in 
[normal]the 
[normal]2006 results
[normal], reflecting a 
[normal]concerted 
[normal]drive
[normal], but 
[normal]reliance on 
[normal]‘equivalents’
[normal] remained high. 
[normal]20
[normal]) 
[normal]C
[normal]lose analysis 
[normal]showed that even 
[normal]the 
[normal]higher achieving pupils 
[normal]in academies tended 
[normal]to have a narrow curriculum. For example, 
[normal]looking at
[normal] th
[normal]eir most successful 42 percent
[normal] of pupils
[normal] (
[normal]i.e. those gaining five or more A*-Cs or equivalent
[normal])
[normal]: 
[normal]This loss of breadth 
[normal]appears
[normal] much greater than in most other schools. 
[normal]21
[normal]) 
[normal]Academies entered 13 times as many pupils for GNVQ as their predecessor schools: on average 1.3 entries per pupil compared with 0.1 per pupil. Some pupils 
[normal]were
[normal] entered for 
[normal]the notional equivalent of 20 different subjects. 
[normal] 
[normal]22
[normal]) 
[normal]Based on the 2007 results,
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal] 
[normal]scrutinised
[normal] the changing pupil populations. 
[normal]R
[normal]educed numbers of FSM pupils 
[normal]were 
[normal]factored into the analysis. 
[normal]Alternatively
[normal], w
[normal]here academies had attracted more non-FSM pupils than their predecessor schools
[normal] – the 
[normal]consequence 
[normal]of new buildings, recruitment driv
[normal]es 
[normal]in
[normal] surrounding areas, etc. - 
[normal] an assumption was made that these 
[normal]pupils 
[normal]should be 
[normal]as successf
[normal]ul as non-FSM pupils nationally, since
[normal] there was no 
[normal]good 
[normal]reason to judge their performance 
[normal]in terms of the
[normal] pupils 
[normal]who had 
[normal]attend
[normal]ed
[normal] the predecessor schools. 
[normal]23
[normal]) 
[normal]This produced 
[normal]a 
[normal]more accurate
[normal] evaluation of gains linked to academy status
[normal] – ‘academy effect’
[normal]. In the most extreme case, an apparent improvement of 22 percentage points 
[normal]was 
[normal]entirely 
[normal]accounted for
[normal] 
[normal]by factoring in the change in pupil population. A
[normal]djusted 
[normal]imp
[normal]rovement statistics ranged from 
[normal]+
[normal]19 percentage points to -27, averag
[normal]ing
[normal] at 0. 
[normal]It should be noted that this 
[normal]was a separate 
[normal]calculation 
[normal]and 
[normal]did not take into account the impact of replacing GCSEs with GNVQs.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The current situation[bold]24
[normal]) 
[normal]As noted above, recent NFER research 
[normal]based on 2012 results
[normal] 
[normal]has 
[normal]recently 
[normal]confirmed that academies rely substantially for their 
[normal]apparent 
[normal]improvement on ‘equivalent’
[normal] qualifi
[normal]cations
[normal]. 
[normal]I
[normal]mproved 
[normal]DfE
[normal] 
[normal]statistical
[normal] presentation had already ena
[normal]bled me to do so 
[normal]based o
[normal]n the 2011 examination entry. The 
[normal]DfE
[normal] 
[normal]now provide
[normal] 
[normal]GCSE-only figures 
[normal]and 
[normal]also 
[normal]discrete
[normal] data
[normal] for
[normal] disadvantaged
[normal] pupils. 
[normal]184 academies 
[normal]were 
[normal]open by September 2009
[normal] 
[normal]i.e. long enough for a cohort of pupils to have completed Key Stage 4 
[normal]while 
[normal]at 
[normal]the 
[normal]academy
[normal] before
[normal] taking GCSEs in June 2011
[normal]. 
[normal]Unless
[normal] otherwise stated, 
[normal]the 
[normal]following 
[normal]analysis is 
[normal]based on these 184 academies. 
[normal](This date
[normal] also mean
[normal]s
[normal], of course, that Coalition academies
[normal], 
[normal]with
[normal] different characteristics,
[normal] are not included.)
[normal]Academies, failing schools and disad
[normal]vantage
[normal]25
[normal]) 
[normal]First 
[normal]of all, it is important to question the 
[normal]stereotype
[normal] that pre-Coalition academies 
[normal]generally
[normal] replace
[normal]d
[normal] low achieving schools in 
[normal]disadvantaged 
[normal]areas. 
[normal]T
[normal]he earliest 
[normal] and most disadvantaged, 
[normal]44 opened by September 2006
[normal],
[normal] have an average 33% of pupils with FSM entitlement
[normal] -
[normal] well above 
[normal]national 
[normal]average
[normal] but 
[normal]average for major conurbations
[normal] 
[normal]such as 
[normal]Manchester, Birmingham or inner London. 
[normal]Of
[normal] all 
[normal]pre-Coalition academies (open by September 2010),
[normal] only half can claim to replace ‘fa
[normal]iling schools
[normal]’
[normal], 
[normal]according to
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]predecessor schools’ results a year 
[normal]before closure
[normal] and
[normal] on the 
[normal]‘floor target’ 
[normal]c
[normal]riterion
[normal]; a
[normal]round a third do not fit the 
[normal]disadvantage 
[normal]stereotype,
[normal] 
[normal]due to
[normal] a selective intake or
[normal] few FSM
[normal] pupils
[normal]. 
[normal]GCSE and ‘equivalent’ qualificatio
[normal]ns
[normal]26
[normal]) 
[normal]In 2011, 
[normal]48
[normal]% of academy pupils (i.e. academies open by Sept 2009) 
[normal]gained five or more A*-C grades 
[normal]or equivalents
[normal] including English and 
[normal]Maths
[normal], but only 3
[normal]5
[normal]% based on
[normal] 
[normal]GCSEs only
[normal] -
[normal] a 
[normal]difference 
[normal]of 13
[normal] percentage points. In mainstream maintai
[normal]ned schools a
[normal]cross England, the comparative figures are 59% ‘with equivalents’, 53% by GCSEs alone, a 
[normal]difference 
[normal]of 6 percentage points. In other words, academies rely 
[normal]twice as much on alternative qualifications
[normal]. 
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]difference
[normal] between ‘with equivalents’ and ‘GCSEs only’ 
[normal]in individual academies 
[normal]spreads evenly from 0 to 45 percent points
[normal] (
[normal]even 70 
[normal]in one case
[normal])
[normal]. 
[normal]The difference is more than 20 percentage points i
[normal]n 
[normal]a fifth of
[normal] academies
[normal]. 
[normal]27
[normal]) 
[normal]The
[normal] current Secretary of State has 
[normal]loudly 
[normal]denounced
[normal] ‘gaming’ (i.e. exploitation of 
[normal]alternative qualifications) to inflate exam success. It 
[normal]seems 
[normal]ironic that academies are the worst offenders. 
[normal]28
[normal]) 
[normal]It is evident
[normal] that ‘equivalent’ qualifications do not 
[normal]equate with
[normal] good GCSE grades. 
[normal]Many
[normal] academy 
[normal]pupi
[normal]ls with
[normal] E-
[normal]G grades 
[normal]in 
[normal]GCSE Science or 
[normal]Maths
[normal] 
[normal]are
[normal] deemed to have obtained the ‘equivalent’ of A*-C via an alternative qualification. 
[normal]Although some
[normal] awards
[normal] (e.g. Engineering) do signify a 
[normal]wider
[normal] 
[normal]vocational 
[normal]curriculum, most are easier versions of 
[normal]popular
[normal] GCSE su
[normal]bjects (Science and ICT
[normal] 
[normal]are the most 
[normal]frequent
[normal], followed by Business
[normal].

[normal]Disadvantaged pupils
[normal]29
[normal]) 
[normal]DfE
[normal] statistics from summer 2011 
[normal]analyse
[normal] attainment specifically for disadvantaged pupils. These are 
[normal]almost all
[normal] FSM
[normal]-
[normal]entitled pupils but also include looked-after children. 
[normal]34
[normal]% of  disadvantaged pupils 
[normal]in academies 
[normal]obtained five or more A*-C grades or equivalent with English and 
[normal]Maths
[normal] 
[normal]–
[normal] 
[normal]the same proportion as
[normal] 
[normal]in 
[normal]non-academy 
[normal]schools. 
[normal]30
[normal]) 
[normal]However a
[normal]cademies are less succe
[normal]ssful 
[normal]on GCSEs-only 
[normal](
[normal]24%, compared with national average 28.6%.) 
[normal]Although academies tend to have more disadvantaged pupils than other schools, disadvantaged pupils gain little from attending an academy. 
[normal] 
[normal]31
[normal]) 
[normal]Only i
[normal]n 
[normal]the oldest 
[normal]academies 
[normal](
[normal]open five years o
[normal]r more
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]is 
[normal]GCSE-only attainment better than national average
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]but marginally 
[normal](
[normal]30% as opposed to 
[normal]28.6%
[normal], i.e. a benefit to 
[normal]only
[normal] 1 disadvantaged pupil in 100
[normal])
[normal]. There is also enormous variation 
[normal]among 
[normal]these 
[normal]older 
[normal]academies 
[normal](
[normal]a third score less than 20%)
[normal]. 
[normal]Pupils
[normal] with low prior attainment
[normal]32
[normal]) 
[normal]A separate analysis 
[normal]looks at 
[normal]pupils entering secondary school with KS2 attainment below level 4 (the 
[normal]bottom
[normal] fifth by prior attainment). 
[normal]Even 
[normal]with 
[normal]‘
[normal]equivalents’
[normal],
[normal] only 6.9% of them reach 5 A*-C
[normal] nationally
[normal], 7.6% in academies. This 
[normal]suggests 
[normal]that attending an academy helps only 1 in 100 
[normal]pupils 
[normal]with low prior attainment 
[normal]to catch up. 
[normal]Data for pupils with Level 4 KS2, and those with above Level 4, 
[normal]are slightly wor
[normal]se in academies than elsewhere. I
[normal]n other words, a
[normal]chievement at age 16 relates almost entirely to achievement at age 11, 
[normal]regardless of
[normal] 
[normal]the type of school
[normal]. 
[normal]Chains
[normal]33
[normal]) 
[normal]Major
[normal] sponsors 
[normal]do not appear
[normal] to be any more
[normal] effective
[normal]. 
[normal]Firstly there is considerable variation, between major sponsors and within each chain. 
[normal]Secondly, although 
[normal]disadvantaged pupils
[normal] tend to do 
[normal]slightly
[normal] 
[normal]better under 
[normal]major 
[normal]sponsors than in other academies, their attainment 
[normal]is still
[normal] 
[normal]lower
[normal] than in non-academie
[normal]s. 
[normal]Thirdly, the 
[normal]reliance on
[normal] ‘equivalents’ is high, 
[normal]and very high
[normal] in some chains and 
[normal]academies
[normal]. In 
[normal]half the chain academies,  20% or fewer disadvantage pupils achieved five or more A*-Cs with English and 
[normal]Maths
[normal] by GCSE only. 
[normal]The floor target
[normal]34
[normal]) 
[normal]An arbitrary 
[normal]figure, the ‘floor target’ (now being raised annually)
[normal],
[normal] has been 
[normal]used
[normal] to 
[normal]signal
[normal] potential closure and 
[normal]academi
[normal]s
[normal]ation
[normal]. 
[normal]On this criterion,
[normal] one ou
[normal]t of seven existing academies 
[normal]should be considered for closure
[normal]. 
[normal]This is
[normal] 
[normal]also 
[normal]true 
[normal]among
[normal] longer established academies. 
[normal]Furthermore, m
[normal]any other academies 
[normal]would only escape
[normal] because of their heavy reliance on ‘equivalents’. 
[normal] 
[normal]Without this
[normal], more than 1 in 3 academies 
[normal]might
[normal] be 
[normal]a candidate for closure
[normal]. 
[normal]Do academy pupils receive a rounded education
[normal]?
[normal]35
[normal]) 
[normal]Over
[normal]-
[normal]reliance on ‘equivalents’ is 
[normal]limiting
[normal] the curriculum
[normal]. Of a smaller sample chosen for close scrutiny, o
[normal]nly 12% sat History or Geography (
[normal]cf
[normal] 57% 
[normal]in other schools
[normal]). Only half as many pupils 
[normal]as elsewhere took a 
[normal]creative art
[normal]s subject
[normal]. Only 
[normal]a third as
[normal] many 
[normal]as elsewhere 
[normal]took a language (14% 
[normal]cf
[normal] 40%). Only 10% took a Design and Technology option. 
[normal]In order to meet English and 
[normal]Maths
[normal] targets, 
[normal]these academies 
[normal]were entering
[normal] 
[normal]most of their pupils twice each
[normal] year starting in Year 9. 
[normal] 
[normal]36
[normal]) 
[normal]Using the newly announc
[normal]ed 
[normal]Ebac
[normal] as 
[normal]a
[normal] 
[normal]criterion
[normal] 
[normal](albeit problematic)
[normal], only 8% of academy pupils 
[normal]passed
[normal] 
[normal]this
[normal], 
[normal]half as many as in non-academies. In 
[normal]a third of 
[normal]academ
[normal]ies
[normal] 
[normal]nobody
[normal] achieved 
[normal]Ebac
[normal] in 2011.  
[normal]Is the situation improving? 
[normal]37
[normal]) 
[normal]T
[normal]hree in five academies 
[normal]appeared to have improved
[normal] more than other schools
[normal]; 
[normal]a fifth show
[normal]ed
[normal] no trend and another fifth a decline. 
[normal]However
[normal] in most of these 
[normal]cases
[normal] the 
[normal]apparent 
[normal]improvement 
[normal]was 
[normal]due to ‘equivalents’
[normal],
[normal] or was already 
[normal]occurring 
[normal]in the ye
[normal]ars before academy conversion. Consequently o
[normal]nly one in five 
[normal]academies
[normal] could
[normal] attribute improvement to being an academy – the elusive ‘academies effect’.
