[[[register]]]&#xa0;This document provides background information for the Health Select Committee about:&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Our processes for doctors who receive criminal sanctions]]]&#xa0;Our rules allow us to deal quickly with doctors who have received a criminal conviction or caution. &#xa0;Any doctor who receives a custodial sentence is automatically referred to the Medical Practitioner Tribunal Service (MPTS), which now hears all cases pursued by the GMC. &#xa0;As soon as we receive information about such a conviction we consider as a priority whether the matter should be referred to an Interim Orders Panel (IOP). Most doctors with serious criminal convictions are removed from the medical register or suspended for a time and most can only return to work under strict conditions.&#xa0;Other than in the most extraordinary circumstances, the GMC will always call for the doctor to be removed from the register in cases where there is a serious conviction such as sexual misconduct and serious dishonesty.&#xa0;

[[[Number of doctors on the register with criminal convictions]]]&#xa0;There are 761 doctors registered with a licence to practise with a criminal conviction (see Annex). This represents 0.32% of licensed doctors on the register. 590 of these doctors’ convictions relate to driving offences. &#xa0;Whilst we almost always call for the doctor to be removed from the register in cases where there is a serious conviction, there are nevertheless a small number of doctors who are on the register who we wanted to be removed and the panel took a different view. There are 14 licensed doctors on our register who we called for to be erased since 2008; 11 of these were suspended, 1 received undertakings and 2 received a warning.&#xa0;Details about the number of licenced doctors per conviction are included in the Annex. We would be happy to provide further information and statistics if the Committee would find this useful.&#xa0;

[[[Steps we are making to improve our processes]]]&#xa0;We are about to review our indicative sanctions guidance. This is the guidance used by our decision makers and by panels to assist them in deciding the appropriate sanction depending on the nature of what has been found proven. A consultation with the all interested parties, including the public will take place next year. &#xa0;For serious convictions we almost always seek erasure or in a few cases ‘at least suspension’ and we have been pressing the government to give us a right of appeal where we subsequently disagree with the panel decision. This will be a major step forward in ensuring the GMC can most effectively protect the public by allowing us to contest a decision by a panel with which we do not agree. The Health Select Committee have previously called on the Government to introduce legislation that will allow the GMC to appeal panel decisions when we disagree with the outcome of a hearing. We have been working closely with the Department of Health on this matter, they have agreed to this in principle and have said they will seek to introduce it as soon as possible. The Professional Standards Authority currently has that right of appeal but it argues that the scope for the appeal is too limited and we agree. &#xa0;As the committee is aware the adjudication process is now managed by the Medical Practitioner Tribunal Service which is headed by a former judge His Honour David Pearl and the decisions it makes are autonomous . &#xa0;We are also seeking powers to remove doctors from the register without the need for a hearing if they have committed very serious offences which are incompatible with practising as a doctor. Under our rules and legislation only a fitness to practise panel can remove a doctor from the register. In order to be compliant with human rights legislation a doctor would have a right to make representations which we would consider prior to removing their name from the register but a hearing would not be necessary. We have consulted on this and now just need the legislation to do it.

[[[How we ensure we are notified when doct]]]

[[[ors are convicted of a criminal offence]]]&#xa0;We work with the appropriate bodies to ensure that we are notified in a timely manner when doctors receive a caution or have been charged with or found guilty of a criminal offence.&#xa0;We currently receive referrals about doctors from the police in England, Wales and Northern Ireland via the Notifiable Occupations Scheme. This scheme provides guidance to the police to notify regulatory bodies and some employers about arrests and criminal record information, including minor offences, of persons working in certain sensitive occupations as the individual comes to notice. A separate scheme operates in Scotland.&#xa0;The Home Office is currently reviewing the work of the Notifiable Occupation Scheme following the creation of the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS), which replaced the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) and Independent Safeguarding Authority (ISA). We are talking to the Home Office and the Police about their plans and if the process were to be refreshed we would expect to continue receiving timely notification of information directly to us. &#xa0;We also refer cases ourselves to the DBS. We have made 430 referrals since 2009 (421 to DBS since 2009 and 9 to Disclosure Scotland). Of these, 129 referrals were in relation to sexual convictions (128 to DBS and 1 to Disclosure Scotland). We are the most active of the health and social care regulators in working with the government and the DBS to develop clear guidelines for referral. &#xa0;We also require doctors to inform us when they receive a caution or criminal offence. Our core guidance for all doctors, Good medical practice, states that ‘you must inform the GMC without delay if, anywhere in the world, you have accepted a caution, been charged with or found guilty of a criminal offence’.&#xa0;December 2013
