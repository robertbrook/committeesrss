"1\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Asylum Support Appeals Project (ASAP) (LAI 0068)&#xa0;\nAbout the Asylum Support Appeals Project (ASAP)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nExamples, research and litigationWhether or not an asylum seeker as a determinant of legal aid\n \n&#xa0;\nCase study: Mr A was assisted by a legal aid solicitor in making his application for support as well as his asylum claim. The Home Office had refused his application for support on the basis that they did not believe he had ever claimed asylum in the UK. His case was\n complicated because he had initially come to the UK through a third country to which he had been removed in 2006. But he had returned to the UK at some point and claimed asylum. Although the Home Office disputed this, he was able to show he had been inter\nviewed by the Home Office and had yet to receive a decision on his claim. The Tribunal judge found that he was an asylum seeker and he was granted support. \nCase study: Mr H had submitted further submissions to the Home Office following the refusal of his asylum claim. The Home Office rejected these saying they did not amount to a fresh claim for asylum. His solicitors then issued a Judicial Review which was settled by Co\nnsent Order. The Order made it clear that the Home Office had agreed to reconsider his fresh claim as an asylum claim. However, when he applied for support his application was refused on the basis that he was not an asylum seeker as his further submissions\n were still pending. It emerged in his support appeal that the Home Office caseworker had interpreted the Consent Order to mean that they were merely going to reconsider the further submissions, not that they had agreed they amounted to a new asylum claim.\n He won his appeal for support. \nCase study: Mr B’s \napplication had been refused on the grounds that it was not belie\nved he had an outstanding case.  However\n, he had recently obtained permission to have his case considered by the Court of Appeal following \nthe Home Office’s refusal of his fresh claim. He had been released from immigration detention but shortly after was admitted to a psychiatric ward as he suffered from serious mental health problems. He was thought to be at risk of suicide and suffered from\n Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. He was sleeping in parks at the time of his support appeal.\n He won his appeal and was given support. \n&#xa0;\nConnection to the UK\n as a determinant of legal aid\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCase study: Ms B arrived in the UK 14 years ago and claimed asylum. In 2009 she submitted a fresh claim to the Home Office which was still outstanding when we met her. Given the delay in considering her fresh claim, she had been granted permission to work and had take\nn up a job as a care worker, paying taxes in the UK. In June 2012 following a change in policy the Home Office restricted the work she could do to the shortage occupation list. She lost her job. As she was not qualified to carry out any of the jobs on the \noccupation list she has not been able to work since then and is now in receipt of asylum support.  \n&#xa0;\nCase study: Mr M has been in the UK for 12 years. He now has two young children who are settled in the UK, one of whom is British. Although he does not live with his children he has regular contact with them and takes an active role in their upbringing. When we met h\nim he was in the process of preparing a further application to the Home Office on the basis of this established family life.\nNeed for legal aid \ngenerally \nfor our clients\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCases we referred for \nlitigation in 2012\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCase study: The particular difficulties these individuals will experience when trying to leave the UK is highlighted by the case \nof Mr A, who is a \nBidoon\n from Kuwait.   In common with many Kuwaiti \nBidoons\n, Mr A and his family had lived Kuwait for many years but never acquired Kuwaiti citizenship.   Whilst in UK he had approached the Kuwaiti embassy several times to try and obtain do\ncuments to return but these were refused on the basis that he was not a national of Kuwait.  Following a decision by the Tribunal to refuse him support on the basis that he was not taking enough steps to return, we referred his case to a solicitor.   Durin\ng the process of the judicial review, the Treasury Solicitor settled and agreed to grant him support and to backdate this to the day of his appeal hearing.  \nCase Study: This is illustrated by the case of Mr B who, following a successful appeal, was offere\nd accommodation in Wales.   However, his partner and two young children were housed in London which would have severely limited the contact he could have with them.   The solicitors issued a letter before claim, pointing out Home Office’s duties to promote\n the welfare of children and also their obligations to preserve family life as far as possible.  Following the letter, UKBA agreed to house Mr B close to his family in London thus ensuring he had sufficient contact with his partner and children.\nTable showing ASAP referrals to solicitors Date \nIssue\nResult \nMigrant eligible post residence test?\n \nJan 2012\n&#xa0;Claimant refused Section 4 support on appeal on the grounds that he was not considered as taking enough steps to return to Kuwait.

By time of full hearing of JR took place, the SSHD had accepted it as a fresh claim but Mr Justice Collins decided issue of importance so \nshould proc\need.  N \nhad attempted to apply for support, but NASS refused it although they acknowledged that the HO had received his fresh claim (applications for s4 support prior to 2005 did not lead to an appeal and so JR was the only remedy here).  Judgme\nnt quotes Bingham in CA in \nOnibiyo\n 1996 on why the Refugee Convention must allow for fresh claims, and what test should be to qualify as one (new material etc) and that if it is a fresh claim, then there must be a right of appeal. And that JR is the correc\nt remedy to use to compel the SSHD, if he errs, to accept it as a fresh claim. But therefore making a fresh claim and it being accepted as one are 2 separate stages, and only the latter triggers entitlement to s95 support\n&#xa0;\nUnclear\n&#xa0;\nCase contains essential \nguidance to both sides on when a ‘fresh claim’ is made, and therefore when asylum support (s95 or s4) becomes available.\n&#xa0;\nAlthough there will now be legal aid to make a fresh claim, it is unclear as to whether there will be legal aid for the same asylum se\neker for an asylum support law case \nR (\nErdogan\n) v SSHD\n&#xa0;\n[2004] EWCA \nCiv\n 1087\n&#xa0;\nOn issue of when an asylum-seeker fails to appeal an asylum refusal in time, and instead submits an out of time appeal, and whether remains entitled to s95 support. The CA \nallowed the SSHD’s appeal.  Useful guidance on purpose of the asylum support system, and mechanisms to prevent it being abused (\npara\n 19), and also on the importance of the ‘supervisory role of the court in judicial review to give protection where necessary\n’ (\npara\n 20)\n&#xa0;\nUnclear, as above\nR (\nLimbuela\n, \nTesema\n and Adam) v SSHD\nShelter as intervener\n&#xa0;\n[2006] UKHL 66\nIAA 1999 s55 preventing asylum support from those who did not claim on arrival.  All 5 law lords dismissed the SSHD’s appeal, and confirmed that \nthis was a breach or Art 3. The SSHD had also lost at the High Court stage\nYes\n&#xa0;\nBUT the implication of 3.57 is that they will lose legal aid if they are refused asylum, even for an ongoing case.  Therefore this test case would never have reached the lords.\n (\nLimbuela\n became a failed  asylum seeker, \nTesema\n and Adam  became refugees so query whether legal aid would have continued for those two, as a test case)\n&#xa0;\nR (AW,A,Y) v Croydon, Hackney\nSSHD as interested  party      \n&#xa0;\n[2007] EWCA \nCiv\n 266\nSame issue as \nNASS v Westminster but here it concerned failed asylum seekers so was between s21 and s4.  SSHD intervened on the side of the asylum seekers to argue it should be s21.  Lengthy technical judgment on the statutes and regulations which refers to the ‘elabora\nte paper chase through these interlocking provisions’ and ‘important area of law….in a difficult and sensitive field’\n&#xa0;\nNo\nR (M) v Slough BC \n&#xa0;\n[2008] UKHL 52\nBeing HIV positive, and needing medication, did not mean M was in need of ‘care and attention’ \nunder NAA s21.\nNot clear.  Judgment refers to proceedings related to his article 3 claim as ‘still continuing’\n&#xa0;\nBirmingham v Clue\nSSHD as interested party\nShelter as intervener\n&#xa0;\n[2010] EWCA \nCiv\n 460\nJamaican \noverstayer\n, by time of CA hearing she had been given ILR but case continued.  Established that if family has an outstanding Art 8 claim which is not ‘hopeless and abusive’ and they are destitute, \nlocal authority\n should support under the Children A\nct s17 pending determination of claim.  Issue for Birmingham was whether withholding assistance would cause ECHR breach (on facts of this case would). Birmingham’s appeal dismissed.  Case concludes \nwith LJ Dyson ‘it is right that I should record the steps \nthat the Sec of State has agreed to take to mitigate the problems that have been exposed by cases such as the present’.\nNo\n&#xa0;\nClient had strong outstanding immigration case (fitted within DP 5/96 policy)\n&#xa0;\nImportant guidel\nines set out for local authorities\n an\nd SSHD in these type \nof cases (\nie\n non-asylum seeking families) and how to liaise better so as to resolve them more quickly.   Attention of the Court of Appeal on issues clearly benefited the UKBA and \nlocal authorities\n, as UKBA decided to prioritise these c\nases, as they are not entitled to asylum support\n&#xa0;\nR (ZO Somalia) SSHD\n&#xa0;\n[2010] UKSC 36\nOn whether a failed asylum seeker who has been waiting more than a year for the Home Office to consider their further submissions is entitled \nto work, under the EU \nReception\n Directive\n&#xa0;\nunclear\nR (SO) v LB Barking and Dagenham\nSSHD interested party\nThe Children’s Society\n&#xa0;\n[2010] EWCA \nCiv\n 1101\nOn whether local authorities\n or the Home Office should support asylum seeking care leavers after they turn 18.  SSHD arguing on the same side as the asylum seeker and the Children’s Society against the \nlocal authority. It was held that lo\ncal authorities are responsible\n \n&#xa0;\nNo\nR  (VC and K) v Newcastle CC \n SSHD as interested party (and arguing against Newcastle)\n&#xa0;\n(2 judge court, very fully considered)\n&#xa0;\n[2011] EWHC 2673\nOn who is responsible to support failed asylum-seeking families (who are not entitled to s95 because they became failed asylum-seekers \nprior\n to the birth of a child) with outstanding applications – \nlocal authorities\n under CA s17 or the UKBA under IAA s4?  \n Established that it is s17.   CA s122(5) prevents \nlocal authorities \nproviding assistance to children if they would be entitled to s95 support. There is no similar provision regarding s4.\n&#xa0;\nCase proceeded regarding K only.\nAlthough the SSHD supported K at t\nhis hearing (\nie\n that she should be\n supported under the CA), K had\n previously applied for s4 support, been \nrefused and lost her appeal to the FTT(AS). So she and her 2 children under 3 would have been totally without support had she not been able to JR Newc\nastle’s unlawful decision\n&#xa0;\nNo\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nRemarks made by both judges as to the ‘monstrous labyrinth’ and ‘tortuous’ relevant statutory provisions\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNote the position of the SSHD in this case\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nR (MK, AH) v SSHD\nRefugee Action as intervener\n&#xa0;\n[2012] EWHC 1896\nOn \nissue of the Home Office delaying in considering s4 applications until the applicant’s further reps had been considered or 15 working days had elapsed.  Held unlawful, as Art 3 rights at risk.  Very lengthy judgment and led to changes in Home Office policy\n and practice.
