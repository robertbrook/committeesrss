"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Ruth Dixon and Christopher Hood,Department of Politics and International Relations,University of Oxford [PHS0024]&#xa0;&#xa0;\nSummaryAs part of our study\n \no\nf\n developments in UK \nexecutive \ngovernment over the past 30 years, we have collated\n \ndata on \ncomplaints\n to ombudsmen regarding government and public services\n and applications for judicial revie\nw\n.\n In this paper we present the numbers of complaints and applications received and\n (for selected cases)\n the numbers and proportions that passed the first stage of the review process. Numbers of complaints have risen over the past 30 years while success ra\ntes have declined. However, the numbers should be in\nterpreted with caution, as \nremits and working practices have altered over time, which \nmay \naffect both the numbers of complaints and \napparent \nsuccess rates.\nOutline of paper:We report\n the number of complaints received by:\nWe show the numbers and proportions of cases passing the \nfirst stage of the process for\n:\n1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe number of complaints \nreceived by\n ombudsmen\n are \nshown\n \nin Figure 1\n. Data \nwere obtained from the annual reports of each ombudsman\n.\nFigure 1. Complaints Received by Ombudsmen&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNotes on remit and reporting changes:\n1.2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Parliamentary Ombudsman \nonly \ninvestigates\n complaints that are sent via Members of Parliament. Until 2004\n-05\n, \nthe \nnumber\n of complaints \nreceived via MPs \nw\nas\n recorded in the annual reports\n. This number has\n not been reported since that time (although the r\nequirement \nto submit complaints via MPs \nstill \napplies\n)\n. The post-200\n5\n data \nw\nere\n supplied by the office of the PHSO \nas \na personal communication.\n1.2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Health Service Commissioner was established in 1973 to investigate complaints about hospital and community h\nealth services. The remit was expanded in 1996 to include complaints about general practitioners and matters of clinical judgement. Since 2002\n-03 only the total of ‘complaints and enquiries’ were reported for England (2003-04 in the case of Scotland).\n \nEnglish, Scottish and Welsh health complaints were reported separately by the HSC until 1999. After devolution, the respective Public Service Ombudsmen handled \nhealth \ncomplaints in Scotland and Wales. Health complaints to the Northern Ireland Ombudsman (es\ntablished 1969) are not shown. \n1.2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe remit of the \nTax Adjudicator (established 1993)\n \nexpand\ned to include Customs &amp; Excise and the Contributions Agency in 1996 and the Insolvency Service in 2003. The steep (and sustained) increase in complaints in the mid-20\n00s was attributed by the adjudicator to the introduction of tax credits.\n1.2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Prisons and Probation Ombudsman’s remit expanded to include \nthe P\nrobation \nService \nin 2001 and asylum detention centres in 2006. Only prisons complaints are shown here.\n1.2.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the 200\n11-12 Annual Report of the ICO, data protection complaints were reported as 13,034 for 2010-11 (about half the 2010-11 value in the previous year’s report) and 12,985 for 2011-12\n.\n2.1 Judicial review \n(JR) \nis the process \nwhe\nreby\n the courts examine the decisions of public bodies. In its present form \nthe process in England and Wales\n dates from the late 1970s with significant reforms in 1998 and 2000. \nThe procedures are somewhat different in Scotland and Northern Ireland and are\n handled by their respective administrative courts.\n \nThe \nnumber of JR applications\n \nare shown in Figure 2.\n \nData were obtained from annual Judicial Statistics\n (\nJudiciary of \nEngland and Wales)\n, Civil Judicial Statistics \n(The \nScot\ntish Government)\n, and \nJudicial Statistics \n(\nNorthern Ireland Court\ns and Tribunal\n Service\n)\n.\nFigure 2. Applications for Judicial Review.&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.\n1\n \nMost types of complaint \ninvolve\n a\n two-stage process. \nOnly some of the complaints made to the Parliamentary Ombudsman\n or the Health Commissioner proceed\n \nto a full investigation and \nreport, and in\n the \ncase of \nj\nudicial \nr\neview, a\n \nclaimant\n must first be granted ‘permission to \nbring a claim for judicial review\n’\n before proceeding to a final hearing. \nThe cases\n that passed throu\ngh the first stage of\n each procedure\n are\n shown \nin Figure 3\n. \nOur analysis does not include the outcomes of the second stage.\nFigure 3. Numbers and Proportions of Cases Passing the First Stage of the Procedure&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n \nSuccess rates at the first stage depend not only on the merit of the claims, but also on the way in which complaints are handled, which has changed \nover the period. For instance, since 2004 the office of the\n \nParliamentary Ombudsman \n \nhas\n undertake\nn\n \n‘i\nnvesti\ngative activity’ and ‘interventions’ \nfor some complaints \nwithout \nproceeding to \na\n full statutory investigation\n \nand \nreport.\n \n \n3.\n3\n The Health Service\n Commissioner \naltered the method for recording\n complaints\n and investigations\n during the 2000s. There have also been changes to the \ncomplaints \nprocedure\n, which for a period required a three-stage process involving the Healthcare Commission\n. We are \ntherefore unable to report the\n numbers and percentages of cases \npassing the first sta\nge \nconsistently after 2002.\n3.\n4\n The proportion of \ncases granted \npermission \nto bring a claim for judicial review \nhas also fallen. \nHowever, an increasing proportion of cases are settled in the pre-permission stage, often to the satisfaction of the claimant.\n \n \n4. Conclusion4.1 As we showed in Section 2, complaints to ombudsmen and applications for judicial review have all increased markedly over the past three decades. \nThe timing of the most rapid\n increases varied between \nombudsmen.\n4.2 The proportion of com\nplaints \nto \nthe PHSO\n \nand applications for JR allowed to proc\need through the first stage has\n fallen, as shown in section 3. \nT\nhere have been changes to the ways in which claims are handled which \ncould \naffect apparent success rates\n, including an increas\ned\n use \nof more informal resolution procedures (see paragraphs 3.2 and 3.4, above)\n. \n4.3 Consistent time series of complaints about public bodies are valuable metrics. Our data collection exercise was often frustrated by changing reporting conventions. Such \ndata \nb\nreaks have been more frequent since 2000. While some breaks reflected changed working practices and led to new consistent series, in other cases reporting \nconventions \nchanged from year to year \nmaking comparison impossible. In addition,\n some long-standing s\neries, \nsuch as the number of complaints received by the Parliamentary Ombudsman \nvia\n MPs,\n \nceased to be\n publicly reported. \n4.4 Such breaks and discontinuities are not only inconvenient for scholars but also have the effect of making the level of complaints \nfar more difficult, if not impossible, to monitor by outside bodies (including the Public Administration Select Committee itself).\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJuly 2013\n              \n \nRuth Dixon and Christopher Hood 2013\n6\n Our research project \nYesterday's Tomorrows: What Happened to the Future of Government?\n (\nhttp://xgov.politics.ox.ac.uk/\n) is funded by the Leverhulme\n Trust. We are grateful to Susan Divald for research assistance with some of the data collection reported in this article.\n Since 2002 the Scottish Public Services Ombudsmen has handled complaints about the administration of public services in Scotland, a\nnd since 2005 the Public Services Ombudsman for Wales has undertaken that role in Wales.\n Since the creation of the Health Service Commissioner (HSC), the offices of Parliamentary Ombudsman and HSC have been held by the same person, now known as the Parli\namentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO).\n V.
