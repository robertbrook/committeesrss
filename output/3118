defaultWritten evidence from the 
defaultAirport Operators Association 
default(WRT 036)
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Airport Operators Association (AOA) is the national voice of UK airports. We are a trade association representing the interests of UK airports, and the principal such body engaging with the UK Government and regulatory authorities on airport matters. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn recent years, UK airports have taken significant steps – and made major investments in specialist snow clearing equipment – to improve winter resilience. For example, Manchester Airport has invested around £6 million, Aberdeen £1.3 million and Heathrow
default £32.4 million on new snow fleet equipment and staff. An AOA Snow Planning Survey, conducted in 
defaultwinter
default 2012, shows good practice around UK airports, and is co-signed by AOA and the British Air Transport Association, the trade
default body of UK airlines, which is 
defaultenclosed below. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe would therefore advise that AOA member airports have a high state of preparedness for the forthcoming winter period. While it is almost inevitable that very severe winter weather will cause disruption to all modes of transport, UK airp
defaultorts have:
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition to the above, you may also wish to note that CAA led a trial during the last 
defaultwinter period concerned with the reporting of runway condition during winter conditions which involved both airports and airlines. Industry is currently awaiting the publication of the results of this trial but we believe that this further demonstrates our
default desire to continually improve our overall winter resilience.

defaultIntroductiondefaultThe UK in recent years has seen increased interest
default by a number of stakeholders
default in the issue of how civil aviation 
defaultcopes 
defaultwith the disruption 
defaultexceptional weather events can cause. Such exceptional events – such as snow – can impact airports, airlines, surface access transport to airports; and ultimately this affects aviation personnel, freight operations and
default, of course,
default passengers.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn 
defaultearly 
default201
default2, the CAA asked the aviation sector to produce a brief report which details the work UK aviation conducts to address exceptional weather events like snow. 
defaultIn response, o
defaultn behalf of the UK airports sector
default,
default the Airport Operators Association 
default(AOA) 
defaulthas liaise
defaultd with 
defaulta number of 
defaultits network of members to produce the following overview of the positive steps taken by airports in readiness for winter operations.
default In producing the report, AOA has worked with the British Air Transport Association (BATA) and several of
default its member airlines to ensure the findings reflect efforts made not only by airport operators but also by UK airlines. Other stakeholders – including national and local government and their agencies – also have key roles to play in ensuring airport and ai
defaultrline operations can continue to function during challenging winter weather conditions.
default&#xa0;
defaultPlease see in the pages to follow a
default list of examples of the work airports 
defaultand airlines undertake 
defaultto address snow events which can affect their winter operations. When 
defaultreading this document, it is important to bear in mind that there should be no expectation that these activities are being done by all airports or 
defaultairlines or 
defaultindeed are appropriate for all airports 
defaultand airlines 
default– the list merely highlights the work and in
defaultitiatives undertaken to deal with 
defaultadverse winter weather
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe document details examples of recent changes and good practice conducted by UK airports and airlines in three sections: operational; management; and passenger communications and welfare. Its 
defaultpurpose is to provide an indicative précis of some of the work UK airports and airlines perform where appropriate t to address the impact of snow on winter operations.

defaultWe thank the following airports for their assistance: Aberdeen, Belfast City, Birmingha
defaultm, Blackpool, Bristol, Edinburgh, Exeter, Gatwick, Glasgow, Heathrow, Leeds Bradford, Liverpool, London City, Luton, Manchester, Newcastle, Newquay Cornwall, Norwich, Prestwick, Southampton, and Stansted.
