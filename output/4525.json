"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Centre for Low Carbon Futures&#xa0;\nSummary&#xa0;\nResponses to questionsQ1. Will the Government's current approach towards low carbon innovation help to achieve the UK's legally binding targets at the lowest possible cost?\n&#xa0;\nQ2. Does the Government have the right balance of focus between \nenergy efficiency, renewable energy and other low carbon technologies?\n&#xa0;\nQ3. What \noutcomes, if any, are the LCICG likely to achieve? How should its forthcoming strategy drive more investment into low carbon innovation, and how should it measure success?\n&#xa0;\nQ4. Are the Government &amp; LCICG targeting investment towards the most effe\nctive stages of the innovation process, including over the long-term?\n&#xa0;\nQ5.
