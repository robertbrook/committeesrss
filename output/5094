defaultWritten evidence submitted by Professor Sheila M Bird (BTO0011) default1.1 I am a biostatistician programme-leader at the Medical Research Council’s (MRC) Biostatistics Unit and hold a visiting professorship in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Strathclyde University in Glasgow. My 
defaultbiostatistical
default work on Transmissible Spongiform 
defaultEncephalopathies
default (TSEs) 
defaultand on organ donation and transplantation 
defaultspans two decades. 
defaultI gave evidence to the BSE Inquiry, quantified UK BSE dietary exposure by birth-cohort
default and gender
default, and have been instrumental in European TSE surveillance designs.
default  A
defaults a biostatistician
default, I have needed to be deeply immersed
default in, and 
defaultam admiring of
default, TSE science.
defaultI conducted the 1988-90 confidential audit of all deaths in intensive care units in England and Wales by which relatives’ refusal-rate (then 30%) was quantified and the barriers to organ-specific donation from brain-stem dead potential donors were identified. I have never been a supporter of the NHS Organ Donor Register as opt-out registrations would be many fewer and the associated registration and analyses more manageable. In response to the 2008 report by the Organ Donor Taskforce, Bird and Harris (2010) estimated the plausible gain from presumed consent.
default1.2 In 1988, I joined the MRC’s Working Party on Human Spongif
defaultorm 
defaultEncephalopathies
default. During the next 20 years, I served on a range of sub-committees which dealt with TSEs: in the UK, for MRC, Department of Health (DH), Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC), Health Protection Agency (HPA, now Health Protection England, HPE); in Europe, under the auspices of the Ad Hoc TSE/BSE Subgroup of the European Commission Scientific Steering Committee (1999-2003). In particular, I designed Europe’s late-stage BSE/TSE surveillance in cattle and sheep at abattoirs (which revolutionized understanding of 
defaultscrapie
default epidemiology) and so was 
defaultrapporteur
default on 
defaultRequirements for statistically authoritative BSE-TSE surveys.
default  European Commission, Brussels: November 2001.
default1.3 My research on human TSEs has been funded by the Medical Research Council mainly (and Food Standards Agency) and has focused on two aspects: first, quantification of UK’s dietary BSE exposure by gender and birth-cohort; secondly, the need to increase substantially the extent of human surveillance - by gender, birth-cohort and genotype at 
defaultcodon
default 129 of the 
defaultprion
default protein - for sub-clinical carriage of 
defaultvCJD
default (more specifically: presence of abnormal 
defaultprion
default protein, 
defaultPrP
defaultSC
default). 
default1.4 Cooper and Bird (2003) showed that UK dietary BSE exposure had been greater in the 1940-69 birth-cohort than in those born in 1970-95 and that dietary BSE exposure therefore did not explain the young age of 
defaultvCJD
default cases unless susceptibility to clinical progression from dietary BSE exposure was strongly age-dependent, for example markedly decreased beyond teenage.
default1.5 In committees and publications, I proposed 
defaultPrP
defaultSC
default surveillance at forensic autopsies, for which an HPA protocol was developed and ethically-approved; but did not proceed. Instead, HPA re-grouped and successfully oversaw 
defaultPrP
defaultSC
default surveillance by gender and birth-cohort (and with genotyping of 
defaultPrP
defaultSC
default positives) in 30,000 appendices, results of which were recently published in British Medical Journal. Continuation from 30,000 to at least 100,000 tested appendices was originally envisaged.
default1.6 More controversially, I have also argued that those caught up in 
defaultvCJD
default-at-risk networks who have a guesstimated 
defaultvCJD
default-risk of at least 1% should 
defaulteither
default be subject of mandatory forensic post-mortem in the interest of public health 
defaultor at the very least
default be asked to give permission-in-life for 
defaultvCJD
default-informative tests to be done post-mortem in the event of their death and consent-rate monitored. Neither is done.
default1.7 UK’s 
defaultPrP
defaultSC
default surveillance in appendices suggests that around 1 in 2,000 tests positive.
default1.8 
default If similar surveillance - at autopsy, on 
defaultanonymised
default appendix tissue, or by use of a suitable blood or urine test in 
defaultanonymised
default blood samples from at-risk persons - were applied to those caught up in 
defaultvCJD
default-at-risk networks, then we might expect 1 in 100 to be positive for 
defaultPrP
defaultSC
default if the 1% assumption were sound.
default1.9 If the 1% expectation proved unsound
default, 
defaultthen the assumptions underlying its
default derivation need revision. But, without empirical evidence from surveillance in those highly-at-risk, there can be no revision.
