[[[Written evidence from Professor Donald Bligh [CST0059]]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[My ID and relevant background]]]I am Professor Donald Bligh.    I represent no organisation.  1985-1995 I was Special Adviser to the Home Office on Police Curricula and the Promotion Exams for Sergeants and Inspectors.  During that time I retrained police trainers nationally after PACE and Scarman.  I was then Police Ombudsman for those examsSince then I have been a University Honorary Fellow in Police Studies, a volunteer inspector of detainees in police cells, a Neighbourhood Watch Coordinator and a member of a PA.  I read in the Times for November 20th 2013 that Mr Jenkin was shocked by police fabrication of crime statistics.  On 14/12/2013 the Times ran an article headed “Met silences the PC who exposed ‘fiddled’ figures”.  For 14 years I have researched the consequences of suspicious crime statistics in Tshire, the bullying of a potential whistleblower, the apparent collusion and cover-up by all public institutions concerned, and the repercussions for his family.  You suggested I comment.

[[[Conclusion]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Abstract]]]

[[[1]]]              What I find is an alleged conspiratorial chain of criminal collusion where professional and inter-professional loyalties are more important than the truth or the rights of lay citizens.  I have reason to believe this is part of a wider malaise.  I suggest a response, albeit an inadequate one.  

[[[Events]]]

[[[2]]]              

[[[Suspicious statistics.  ]]]In the mid 1990s Tshire, a relatively small rural constabulary, appeared to be reporting very high levels of Violence Against the Person (VAP) and high levels of detected crime, when compared with similar areas of the country.  Probably responsibility for their presentation lay with the Deputy Chief Constable (DCC), Assistant Chief Constable (ACC), Chair of the Police Authority (Chair), the PA Clerk and the Detective Chief Superintendent.  &#xa0;

[[[3]]]              

[[[The Chief wanted a review.  ]]]The raw figures went unnoticed amongst those for the big cities.  However when I calculated VAP per 1000 population (which the Home Office did not do) the anomaly stood out.  Yet a newly arrived Chief Constable, (CC) did notice.  He funded a review and asked Officer PWB to set up a short list of potential researchers.  Reportedly the DCC was livid.  DCC and ACC, with the apparent support of the Clerk and Chair, made a complaint against the CC regarding the contract to investigate statistics.  Officer Potential Whistleblower (PWB) had information to falsify this complaint.  &#xa0;

[[[4]]]              

[[[Bullying a potential whistleblower.  ]]]Tshire’s Complaints and Discipline Department (C&amp;D), reporting to DCC, started to investigate PWB, his estranged wife and family.  PWB believes they looked at his, his family’s and his wife’s business bank accounts, telephone records, utility bills, community charges, tapped their phones, told the Inland Revenue without evidence they were guilty of “widespread tax evasion”, made 45 house to house enquiries about their marriage; and told their son’s local education authority 240 miles away to withdraw his university grant.  Later they prosecuted PWB and his wife regarding an innocent university grant application.  The C&amp;D also tried to caution their children for alleged offences related to this application.  PWB observed that C&amp;D’s interview transcripts sent to the CPS had over 100 excisions.  One interview was reduced from 62 to 15 pages.  The effect and purpose was to discredit PWB.  His evidence about the contract relating to criminal statistics was never asked for or obtained.  It seems the Chair and Clerk of the PA arranged a pension and resignation agreement with CC that compelled absolute secrecy.  &#xa0;

[[[5]]]              

[[[PWB’s complaint.  ]]]Wanting to complain PWB wrote to the Home Secretary.  He did not believe anyone would investigate the depth and thoroughness with which the C&amp;D persecuted his family.  So he decided to include as much evidence as he could in the complaint itself.  It ran to over 200 pages and contained 132 specific allegations in bold underlined text against the DCC, ACC, CC’s successor (CC2), the Clerk, Chairman and named members of the C&amp;D alleging misfeasance in public office including details of an alleged 

[[[conspiracy]]] to incriminate PWB, his wife and his children, to induce false confessions, to maliciously prosecute Mrs PWB and her children, to pervert justice, to abuse process, and to subvert evidence by making the excisions from interview transcripts.  &#xa0;

[[[6]]]              

[[[Perverting the course of inv]]]

[[[estigation.   ]]]Emails allege that in an abuse of process the Home Office discussed the Complaint with at least one of those accused, probably the Clerk.  Because the Police Complaints Authority (PCA) was not empowered to investigate an alleged conspiracy of junior officers, ACPO officers and PA members, the Home Office sent the Complaint to HMIC who, the Minister said, “does have locus to recommend the appointment of an investigating officer in such cases”.  HMIC consulted two alleged conspirators, the Clerk and CC2, and referred the Complaint to the PCA.  Arguably these three perverted justice because the conspiracy itself, ACPO and PA members were no longer investigated.  Arguably too, HMIC had thereby joined the conspiracy.  Yet the conspirators still had to sideline PWB’s 200 pages of information and its 132 specific allegations.  The CHMIC said the HMI had neither authority nor power to conduct such enquiries; “These are matters for the Chief Constable”.  &#xa0;

[[[7]]]              HMIC sent no copy of the Complaint to the PCA.  Consequently, the PCA had no idea who was complained of, what the complaints were, or any of the evidence.  A Deputy Chairman of the PCA (PCA1) wrote to PWB.  She says the Clerk and CC2’s new DCC, DCC2, attended a meeting to advise the PCA and a DCC from Constabulary A.  This DCC confirms (private communication) that the Clerk and DCC2 sat through that meeting without saying the Clerk was one of those accused.  Effectively DCC2 was thereafter, if not 18 months earlier, also a member of the alleged conspiracy.  Thus the alleged conspiracy widens.  &#xa0;

[[[8]]]              Deputed as the “Appropriate Authority”, DCC2 ignored PWB’s original Complaint and selected new allegations based on an invited supplementary statement by PWB.  PWB and I say the allegations were trivial, uninvestigable and selected to fail.  One fabrication was against an inspector in another force of whom PWB made no mention or complaint.  It showed knowledge only possessed by officers C&amp;D3 and C&amp;D4.  Despite repeated requests, the number and content of these misrepresentations was kept secret by PCA1’s successor, PCA2, and DCC2 who appeared to be in collusion.  &#xa0;

[[[9]]]              In other words the alleged offenders themselves chose the items for investigation.  We allege the PCA enquiry was perverted by the alleged conspirators before it started.  This alleged corruption had a momentum PWB was powerless to stop.  PCA2 refused to consider there was any corruption.  Constabulary A finished their report within a year.  Without its author’s knowledge, it appears Officer W of Tshire, reporting to DCC2, secretly changed it to prevent more complaints.  The alleged criminal conspirator, CC2, owned the report.  &#xa0;

[[[10]]]              To circumvent this power, PWB’s MP and PWB asked to meet the Minister personally to 

[[[show]]] evidence of what was happening.  Hitherto the Home Office’s abuse of process seemed to me somewhat partial.  This would test it.  The Minister refused to see us after 15 months.  She said she got her information from Tshire police, the PA, the PCA and the IPCC.  She failed to appreciate that all these sources got their information from one source, DCC2.  Her description omits his role in paras 7, 8 and 9 above thereby protecting alleged senior conspirators.  This left me questioning the moral integrity of the Home Office officials upon whom ministers must depend.  &#xa0;

[[[11]]]              

[[[The IPCC protects the ]]]

[[[alleged ]]]

[[[conspirators.  ]]]The IPCC undertook a review these events.  Though arguably in the public interest, a IPCC Commissioner has refused to release even a summary of its findings, citing Parliament’s Freedom of Information and Data Protection.  Why not?  I sincerely believe there is concealment of offences to protect alleged criminal conspirators.  In effect a Commissioner joined the alleged conspiracy.  &#xa0;

[[[12]]]              In 2003 and again in 2004 PWB further complained that C&amp;D3 and C&amp;D4 lied to the High Court in a libel case against me, when claiming, amongst many things, there were no excisions from the PWB family’s interview transcripts.  The 2004 complaint set out the alleged criminal implications against ACPO and PA officers.  The IPCC Commissioner avoided these implications by only investigating the 2003 complaint under the 1996 Act, not the latter.  Again I believe the IPCC Commissioner protected alleged senior conspirators.  &#xa0;

[[[13]]]              Officers from another force wrote a very lengthy report that the IPCC Commissioner has also refused to release.  As with the Review, PWB might ask, ‘If there is nothing incriminating in it why can’t it be open; and if there is, what is it? and what is the IPCC’s duty regarding it?’  The IPCC found no law prohibiting lies in the High Court, and then told PWB there was insufficient evidence that officers “knowingly and deliberately” made the excisions.  I can’t understand how they made them unknowingly.  &#xa0;

[[[1]]]

[[[4]]]              After yet more evidence was supplied it appears C&amp;D3 gave the IPCC nearly full transcripts (here called [f]) claiming to be copies of those sent to the CPS (here called [a]).  The IPCC accepted them as such.  The Commissioner and his caseworker refused to send copies for PWB’s scrutiny even though, if truly genuine, PWB should have received them when released by the CPS a decade earlier, instead of receiving those with excisions.  Later we got copies via the IPCC’s London Information Officer.  Thus we have two sets of transcripts.  We can show 10 different kinds of evidence that [f] were not sent to the CPS.  C&amp;D3 must know that.  So should the Commissioner and his caseworker.  The Commissioner’s suggestion that 100+ excisions were made by the CPS attempts to protect C&amp;D3, but so beggars belief that it undermines his own credibility.  For what possible motive would anyone at the CPS have to go through every interview transcript cutting out bits to change the meaning of what was said (13), and to hide evidence of innocence (31), oppression (34), implanted false information (10), errors (7), solicitor interventions (14), fishing (17), lies and misrepresentation (14), other abuses of process and police malpractice (33) for the sole purpose of sending a deception to the PWBs?  And did the CPS then complete new accompanying MG15(T) forms, Exhibit lists, forge C&amp;D3’s signature, re-type all transcripts,  re-stamp all pagination and stamp Exhibit Nos with a stamp they probably don’t possess?&#xa0;

[[[1]]]

[[[5]]]              The alleged conspiracy is not over.  After I reported this alleged forgery as a crime in 2012 two more Gwent officers wrote to protect their colleagues and then refused further correspondence.  &#xa0;

[[[1]]]

[[[6]]]              So much for a few of the documented facts as I see them.  The implications and questions are so diverse I cannot get my head round them.

[[[The innocent suffer most.  ]]]This is a case of bullying, (a) not of a whistleblower, but a potential whistleblower; (b) of his estranged wife and her children who have, and had, nothing to do with Tshire Police or their crime statistics.  They lived 240 miles away.  They are powerless to battle against the pillars of the criminal justice system, the very people employed to maintain standards and protect them.  Parliament allows no challenge to an IPCC conclusion except JR.  How can they afford justice?  What can PWB do?&#xa0;

[[[.  ]]]My allegations, mostly of perverting justice, are against up to 20 members from Tshire’s Complaints and Discipline Department, its Standards Department, ACPO officers, the PA, HMIC, the IPCC, the Home Office and the PCA.  There needs to be an impartial investigation, but none of these organisations can be trusted to do it.  None has shown moral integrity.  Who should take responsibility now?  The Home Secretary?&#xa0;

[[[placed loyalty and power are prioritised above truth and justice.]]]

[[[ ]]]Psychologists call this phenomenon, ‘Groupthink’.  It commonly unites bullying groups.  It is characterised by pressures to conform, perceived safety in group membership, a sense of power, rationalised self justification, a belief in group unanimity, self censorship, belittlement of others, self denial, a belief in their own morality and sometimes ‘mindguards’ who actively prevent expression of dissent.  There may also be laziness: ‘It must be OK if all those people think so’.  Arguably Hillsborough and Met Police also offer examples.  &#xa0;

[[[21]]]              

[[[‘Collusion’ or ‘corruption’?]]]  By saying “collusion” I have carefully stopped short of saying “corruption”.  But when those in positions of governmental public service protect each other in breaking the law, and then use their position and power to pressure conformity by others, is that the essence of a corrupt state?  I cannot prove it, but whatever the word, if the paperwork had fallen on other governmental desks I believe the forces of ‘Groupthink’ would have applied just the same.  It is too much for me to believe a remarkable coincidence that the paperwork always fell to collusively vulnerable individuals.  And that is all the more alarming because most of the individuals in question are in senior positions.  If the media asked me, ‘How near is corruption to the top of these governmental institutions?’ I should have difficulty in giving rational assurance.  &#xa0;

[[[              ]]]

[[[The neglected moral values of policing.  ]]]  Part of the problem is that the police, public and government have a one-sided TV view of what policing should be.  The police are seen as an organisation responding to incidents, catching and prosecuting offenders.  These are the values of power.  They are that of course, but police should offer far more than that.  Police should offer protection and the provision of needs.  Many do.  These are the values of care, compassion and service.  PWB and his family got none of that.  Police need both.

[[[her reform? ]]]If so who is in any position to change this unprofessional collusive counter-culture?  No one.  Individuals have to change themselves.  Changing values cannot be imposed.  Opportunities can be created, that is all.  It is a massive task.  The first step is Truth and Reconciliation using the methods of Restorative Justice.  Without them, do we have a long inquiry and even longer criminal trials?  And what would they do?  We need procedures that can support a culture in changing itself.  That seems lacking.  Attitude change is by far the most difficult task in adult education.  It needs taking employees out of their comfort zone for say two weeks, requiring them to decide upon ambiguous decision scenarios, indentifying and clarifying in discussion the moral principles implied, and the beginning of each day devoted to shared inner reflection in a group of up to 30 similarly engaged.  I have done this work when re-training police trainers.  It requires very careful of preparation of scenarios, but can be rewarding in the long run.  &#xa0;

[[[23]]]              

[[[Conclusion]]]  Statistics for Domestic Violence should be distinguished from other VAP.  Crimes per population could aid interpretation.  I believe what began with suspicious crime statistics has led to a long running criminal conspiracy amongst relatively senior members of police related professions.  There is no effective redress for its victims.  Correspondence shows the police know that and trade upon it.  Thus there is power without adequate restraint, a recipe for corruption.  Secrecy is the vehicle of conspiracy.  I believe its legitimised use is excessive and needless.  More than statistics, ultimately it is these issues and flaws in procedures that need parliamentary attention.  &#xa0;&#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;
