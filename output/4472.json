"&#xa0;\nWritten Evidence Submitted by The Children’s Book Project for Tanzania (CBP)Executive SummeryHigh quality education for all children including disabled in their first years of schooling builds a foundation for future learning and for healthy and productive family and civic life. \nLiteracy skills equip a person to both gain knowledge and understandi\nng of their immediate environment as well as to make sense of the wider world. Research shows that a child who is able to read and write is better able to contribute to his or her personal and community well being. \nPrimary Education Development Plan (PEDP\n III), Big Results Now (BRN) and \nLANES\n proposal firmly recognizes the importance of education to support literacy development, to ensure better lives for the Tanzanians including people with disabilities. But the cha\nllenges are many including semi-\ntrained \nteachers for literacy, lack of Braille reading materials to read, besides having few textbooks transcribed into Braille.\nThe CBP\n’s\n experience\n in Braille Book provision\n is in line with the DFID\n’s\n missi\non to support disabled children and youths to improve th\neir lives, and prepare them to become responsible citizens \ni\nn their communities.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.0&#xa0; \nIntroductionThe Children’s Book Project\n for Tanzania (CBP) is a local N\non – Governmental \nO\nrganization whose main goals are to cultivate a strong reading culture \namong children in Tanzania through the provision of books t\no children for \nthe purpose\n of increasing and widen\ning their knowledge and develop\ning their reading skills; for the teaching of literacy and support for reading \nin the formal education system throug\nh in – service training of teachers and supporting indigenous authorship and publishing.\n&#xa0;\n2.0&#xa0; \nDescription of CBP ActivitiesCBP programme has three main components which include:\nCBP implements a professional development for \nTrainers. This\n \nis \nled\n by CBP’s experienced staff. Trainers are trained for 15 days divided into three 5 – day workshop sessions spread out\n over 8 months. \nIn addition to training of teachers, CBP provides reading materials to help children learn to read and develop life – long habits of reading. Schools are supplied with reading materials and \nteachers are\n given training in library management and in reading p\nromotion\n.\nCBP provides book sector training to publishers, writers, illustrators and editors, with the aim of development professional skills to them hence improving the quality of the books produced.\n3.0 Provision \nof Braille Books for Visually Impaired Children.Rationale for the Project\nIn 1994 CBP organized a Children’s Book Day at the National Library. Among the invited children where visually impaired children from Uhuru Mchanganyiko, in\n Ilala District\n, Dar es Salaam region. The children \nperformed\n a poem which raised their voice that they were being neglected in CBP’s book project \nactivities, while normal ch\nildren were provided with books\n.\nThe children raised their concern that, they had very few textbo\noks in Braille and there were no reading books. \nFollowing the request, CBP embarked on a programme of producing Braille books for visually impaired children. Those were the first readers ever produced for visually impaired children in the countr\ny\n.\n To-date\n \nCBP has transcribed\n 37 story books for visually impaired \nchildren. The\n books have been distributed to 25 schools which cater for the disabled children.\nCurrently there are more than 2,000 visually impaired children in primary schools in Tanzania. Among th\nem are two specials namely Bwigili in Dodoma region and \nFuraha in \nTab\nora region. There are also integrated schools which are Uhuru Mchanganyiko in Dar es Salaam,Mazinyungu in Morogoro region and another one in Lushoto, the rest are inclusive schools.\n&#xa0;\n4.0 ChallengesChildren\nTeachers\n&#xa0;5.0 Recommended ActivitiesCBP will carry out needs assessment to \ndetermine the actual number of visually impaired children who are in primary schools in Tanzania. The number of visually impaired children will determine the print run of the Braille books to be produced and distributed to schools. Apart from getting this \ncrucial information, the project will be informed on the list of schools with such children and number of tutors and teachers available for these children. The information will support project planning.\n2.\n Training of Trainers\n S\nelected\n a\n number of tuto\nrs \nfrom the colleges which train \nteachers for\n visually impaired children and train them on how to teach effective literacy skills .and prepare them to become trainers and mentors.\n.\n T\nrain teachers through in- service teacher training through \nTrain the tra\niner model.\n. The initiative i\ns focusing on \nenabling \nteachers\n to acquire book management\n \nskills\n of Braille books, and provide them with basic librarian skills, a\nnd also on how to incorporate reading materials into instructional strategies of th\neir school culture through library development and instructional prac\ntice.\n.\nThe Braille book provision i\nnitiative strongly supports PED\nP\n III which states the necessity for school libraries and supplementary materials \nto support \nlearning and teaching.\nProvision of Braille Books to \nintegrated\n schools which cater for visually\n impaired\n children \nand \ninclusive\n schools \nwill \nsupport instruction strategies, literacy development and learning outcomes. These materials will support the quali\nty of education, the country’s literacy development and nurture children’s lifelong habits of reading during a formative period of learning.\nCBP has participated in the preparation of the government (Ministry of Education and Vocational Training) proposal \non Literacy and Numeracy (LANES) to the Global Partners Education (GPE) which has been approved. The proposal to GPE did not\n neither\n accommodate an activity for provision of reading \nbooks \nto both normal and visually impaired children nor establishment of s\nchool libraries\n.\nFurthermore, the new presidential Initiative Big Results Now (BRN) and the PEDP III activities did not also accommodate the same. In this respect CBP is appealing to DFID to take the \nresponsibility to provide Braille Books to improve the c\nhildren’s outcome and eventually contribute to improving the quality education.\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
