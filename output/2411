[normal]Written evidence submitted by Shelter[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Summary[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Shelter welcomes the opportunity to submit evidence to the 
[normal]Work and Pensions
[normal] Select Committee on the
[normal] significant reforms
[normal] that have taken place in the welfare system over the past three years
[normal]. More than 
[normal]a 
[normal]million people a year come to us for advice and support via our website, helpline 
[normal]and network of face-to-
[normal]face services. Our evidence is rooted in the experiences of people we help every day, many of whom 
[normal]are extremely worried about housing costs and 
[normal]will be deeply affected by these changes. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]At a time when so many are struggling to make ends meet, losing a j
[normal]ob or a serious illness is all it takes to tip people into a spiral that could end in homelessness.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Having access to a safety net can make all the difference
[normal],
[normal] y
[normal]et the
[normal]se reforms 
[normal]have cut the
[normal] safety net back so much that if the worst happens families might n
[normal]ot be able to get the help and support they need to stay in their homes and get back on their feet. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This submission 
[normal]relates to
[normal] the most detrimental 
[normal]of the 
[normal]housing
[normal] related
[normal] welfare 
[normal]reforms
[normal]:
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]restriction of
[normal] the Local Housing Allowance
[normal] (LHA)
[normal] rates means low income households are increasingly struggling to find af
[normal]fordable private rented housing
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]removal of the 13 week protection
[normal] will
[normal] mean
[normal] m
[normal]any renters who lose their job
[normal] will 
[normal]no longer have a grace period in which they can stay in their hom
[normal]e while seeking a new job
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The
[normal] proposals for the 
[normal]alternative to direct payments
[normal] 
[normal]for Universal Credit 
[normal]are
[normal] insufficiently robust
[normal] and
[normal] react to rent arrears rather than proactively prevent them
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]so called
[normal] ‘b
[normal]edroom 
[normal]t
[normal]ax’
[normal] takes little account of the legitimate needs of disabled people and others for additional space
[normal]. 
[normal]In addition, d
[normal]ownsizing could
[normal] in fact
[normal] increase the 
[normal]housing benefit
[normal] bill, for example if affected households move into the
[normal] more expensive
[normal] private rented sect
[normal]or
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Worryingly, the discretionary, short-term and cash-limited nature of Discretionary Housing Payments means they are inadequate to support people who have been hit by the reforms outlined in this submission and have no alternative support.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We therefore
[normal] make some practical recommendations to ensure these reforms work better, including:
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The DWP commit
[normal]s
[normal] to review affordability and up-rate LHA rates if necessary to ensure low income households can access accommodation
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The ‘b
[normal]edroom 
[normal]t
[normal]ax’ should only apply 
[normal]when alternative smaller accommodation
[normal] is unavailable
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]and certain groups should be exempt
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 13 week protection rule must be replicated under Universal Credit
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Successive governments have moved to curb the rising cost of 
[normal]housing benefit
[normal] by adjusting benefit
[normal] entitlement,
[normal] but these efforts have focused on treating the symptoms rather than the cause.
[normal] While this submission makes recommendations to mitigate against the worst effects of these welfare reforms, t
[normal]he Government must invest
[normal] in 
[normal]buil
[normal]ding new homes
[normal] if it is serious about
[normal] bring
[normal]ing
[normal] down the housing benefit bill
[normal]. This is the only long term way to reduce the cost of housing and lift
[normal] households out of the benefit trap.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Local Housing Allowance Reforms [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]LHA
[normal] is a form of housing benefit paid to tenants in the private rented sector. Un
[normal]til April 2012, 
[normal]LHA
[normal] rates were calculated on a monthly basis based on actual rents in a local market
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Benefit levels would stay the same or even fall if rental markets remained 
[normal]steady
[normal], but if rents started rising due to market pressure, LHA rates would increase to ensure that low income private renting households could
[normal] 
[normal]find affordable accommodation
[normal]. 
[normal]The [bold]Welfare Reform Act broke this fundamental link between support for pr[bold]ivate re[bold]nters and actual rents by linking [bold]LHA rates to CPI inflation from April 2013. [bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]his means LHA rates will fall behind the actual cost of private renting as private rents have traditionally risen faster than inflation (from 1997-2007 rents increased by 
[normal]70 
[normal]per cent but CPI only rose by
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]20 per cent
[normal]). 
[normal]Li[bold]nking CPI to LHA would make a third of local authorities unaffordable to low income households by 2023[bold].[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Minister for 
[normal]Welfare Reform acknowledged that
[normal] linking LHA to CPI 
[normal]risks
[normal] 
[normal]creating a “critical lack of
[normal] affordable housing”
[normal] and said
[normal] the Government was only committed to the measure until 2014-15
[normal], although the policy will automatically run on beyond the current spending review period
[normal]. He pledged to reconsider LHA rates at this point if they 
[normal]were 
[normal]out of ste
[normal]p with local rents
[normal], with the option to increase rates
[normal]. 
[normal]The Government must stick to this pledge. [bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T[bold]he [bold]Welfare Up-rating Act[bold] [bold]2013 [bold]implemented[bold] a further cut, making it more likely that rents will outpace LHA.[bold] 
[normal]LHA
[normal] rates will
[normal] 
[normal]be up-rated by
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a maximum of 
[normal]one 
[normal]per cent
[normal] 
[normal]in 2014-
[normal]15 and 2015-
[normal]16, even if rents or CPI are rising faster than this. 
[normal]The least affordable areas will be exempt, but DWP has so far released insufficient evidence of how this will be calculated and distributed
[normal],
[normal] nor have they addressed concerns about the impact in other areas.
[normal] 
[normal]T[bold]he more LHA rates are held down, the greater the risk that low income households won’t be able to find affordable housing[bold] in the private rented sector[bold]. [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This is exacerbated further by
[normal] [bold]l
[normal]an
[normal]dlords
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal]aversi
[normal]on
[normal] to hous
[normal]ing
[normal] tenants on benefi
[normal]ts. Successive reductions in h
[normal]ousing 
[normal]b
[normal]enefit 
[normal]have
[normal] made claimants more unattractive to 
[normal]landlords
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]A Big L
[normal]ottery funded project by Shelter and Crisis
[normal] 
[normal]showed 
[normal]that 
[normal]landlords’ unwillingness to accept tenants on LHA is 
[normal]a major barrier to access
[normal] a private rented home
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In addition, separate 
[normal]e
[normal]vidence from Shelter
[normal] r
[normal]evealed how poorly the 
[normal]LHA 
[normal]changes have
[normal] been communicated. 
[normal]Claimants 
[normal]we spoke to
[normal] we
[normal]re 
[normal]extremely confused about what
[normal] was changing and 
[normal]what it meant
[normal] for them. We found a t
[normal]endency
[normal] for claimants
[normal] to conflate different chan
[normal]ges or to confuse
[normal] different
[normal] timetable
[normal]s.
[normal] 
[normal]F
[normal]or example, 
[normal]Universal Credit 
[normal](UC) 
[normal]and 
[normal]housing benefit
[normal] changes
[normal] were referred to interchangeably
[normal]. This 
[normal]weaken
[normal]s
[normal] support for U
[normal]C and
[normal] cause
[normal]s
[normal] unnecessary concern.
[normal] The UC roll-out must seek to avoid replicating these communication errors. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Recommendations:[bold]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The [bold]DWP [bold]should [bold]commit to a full [bold]review of affordability in the [bold]housing benefit[bold] sub-market[bold] and [bold]to [bold]up-rate LHA rates if necessary[bold] to ensure [bold]that [bold]low income households can access accommodation[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Social Secto[bold]r [bold]Size C[bold]riteria[bold] [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]With the 
[normal]introduction
[normal] of the 
[normal]social 
[normal]sector size
[normal] 
[normal]criteria
[normal] (the so called ‘bedroom tax’)
[normal] 
[normal]in April 2013, 
[normal]660,000 people living in council or housing association homes had their [bold]housing benefit[bold] reduced as they had one or more rooms[bold] judged to be “spare bedrooms”[bold]. Hard-pressed fami
[normal]lies on the lowe
[normal]st incomes
[normal] now 
[normal]need to find an average of £14 per week out of already stretched b
[normal]udgets to cover the shortfall. 
[normal]Some will be unable to pay this shortfall and will 
[normal]cut back
[normal] on essential spending on food and 
[normal]household bills
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]O
[normal]thers may
[normal] 
[normal]tak
[normal]e
[normal] out debt, joining the one million households who used a pay day loan to cove
[normal]r their housing costs last year, while 
[normal]many
[normal] may risk arrears, eviction and homelessness. This increases
[normal] costs for local authorities and undermines social housing as the last truly
[normal] affordable housing option for families on low incomes. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I[bold]f[bold] [bold]households cannot[bold] cover the difference there is not necessarily anywhere for [bold]them[bold] to move[bold] to, meaning they will be unable to escape the penalty[bold]. Because social landlords have tended to build homes to last families for many years, there is a lack of smaller one and two bed flats for households to downsize into. This is true nationally but 
[normal]is
[normal] 
[normal]a particular problem in certain areas.
[normal] 
[normal]For example, i
[normal]n S
[normal]cotland we know
[normal] that
[normal] of the 82,500 households affected by the social sector size criteria, 60,000 need to move to a 1 bedroom p
[normal]roperty to avoid the pe
[normal]nalty.
[normal] 
[normal]C
[normal]urrently around 20,000 
[normal]one
[normal] bedroom properties are let annual
[normal]ly
[normal] across the whole of Scotland in 
[normal]the
[normal] social sector
[normal]. 
[normal]Downsizing could[bold] actually[bold] increase the [bold]housing benefit[bold] bill, for example if affected households move into [bold]more expensive alternatives such as [bold]the private rented sector, a [bold]higher cost[bold] social rent property (likely if transferring to newer acc[bold]ommodation or from council to housing association[bold] accommodation) or into an A[bold]ffordable [bold]R[bold]ent [bold](up to 80% market rent) [bold]property. [bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Homeless households should not be penalised by the social sector size criteria.  [bold]H
[normal]omeless households living in local authority owned temporary accommodation (TA) 
[normal]should be 
[normal]exempt fro
[normal]m the 
[normal]under occupation
[normal] penalty. 
[normal]This is particularl
[normal]y a problem in Scotland where 56
[normal]% of 
[normal]TA
[normal] is local authority owned rather than leased or 
[normal]licensed
[normal] from a
[normal] 
[normal]social or private landlord
[normal] where different subsidy rules apply. By definition, househ
[normal]olds who are forced to stay in TA
[normal] unt
[normal]il a settled home is available 
[normal]are vulnerable and in stressful situation
[normal]s
[normal] and in particular need of a stable home to get back on their
[normal] feet.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The calculation of how many bedrooms a household needs is a crude assessment which takes little account of the legitimate needs of disabled people [bold]and others [bold]for additional space[bold]. Shelter has been approached by families who have good reasons for their ‘spare’ bedrooms, 
[normal]for example where
[normal] they need space to store essential medical equipment. Only very limited exemptions have been granted for disabled 
[normal]children
[normal] and
[normal] 
[normal]the DWP continues t
[normal]o maintain that the over-stretched 
[normal]DHP
[normal] fund is the best way to support disabled households.
[normal] However,
[normal] there is no guarantee that this will happen, and families have no right to appeal if DHP is not granted.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I
[normal]n 
[normal]the case of 
[normal]Burnip, Gorry and Trengrove
[normal] the Court of Appeal ruled that 
[normal]housing benefit
[normal] regulations and not DHPs
[normal] should cater for disabled children who cannot share a bedroom due to different caring needs. 
[normal]Where 
[normal]the 
[normal]DWP wish to support hard cases it would be more appropriate to do so via statuto
[normal]ry regulations, which provide guaranteed protection, rather than unpredictable DHPs. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Even if DHPs were an appropriate tool to protect hard cases, the additional money that has been made available is unlikely to be sufficient. For example there is no guar
[normal]antee that the
[normal] 
[normal]additional £25 million in 
[normal]intended to support disabled people living in homes with expensive adaptations
[normal] will be sufficient, and it is certain that many other disabled people will not be awarded a DHP
[normal]. 
[normal]In England it has been calculated that the DHP budget [bold]can [bold]only[bold] help one[bold] in every 15 of [bold]all[bold] households affected[bold] by the bedroom tax[bold] and in Scotland it is [bold]1 in 17 (6 per cent[bold]), which means that a significant number of vulnerable people will not have access to[bold] a much-needed DHP payment.[bold]  
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Recommendations:[bold]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The penalty [bold]should [bold]only appl[bold]y[bold] when alternative smaller accommodation[bold] is available and the tenant has[bold] not made an attempt to downsize [bold]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There should be an exemption in regulations for:[bold]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]D[bold]isabled people liv[bold]ing in[bold] specially adapted homes[bold] [bold]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Households in local authority temporary accommodation [bold]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T[bold]hose with legitimate reasons for needing the extra space including: [bold]&#xa0;[bold]4[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Universal C[bold]redit – Alternative Payment Arrangements[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Universal Credit (UC) will be paid as a ‘Standard Payment’ for the majority of claimants
[normal],
[normal] meaning claimants will receive a direct monthly payment to the household, inclusive 
[normal]of 
[normal]housing benefit
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Everyday money management is difficult for those on low i
[normal]ncomes and with complex needs. So, h
[normal]aving to m
[normal]anag
[normal]e
[normal] finances in this way 
[normal]may therefore 
[normal]lead to
[normal] arrears and ultimately eviction.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The DWP has announced 
[normal]welcome 
[normal]safeguards in the form of 
[normal]Alternative Payments Arrangements (APAs)
[normal] where 
[normal]the housing cost component of UC 
[normal]will
[normal] be paid direct to 
[normal]the 
[normal]landlord
[normal]. 
[normal]The APA proposals are welcome, but can be strengthened to ensure arrears are prevented in the first place.  [bold]&#xa0;[bold]4.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The goal for UC claimants in settled accommodation should be improving financial capability to move those who can[bold] to financial independence[bold].[bold] [bold]Each 
[normal]claimant should be assessed to 
[normal]identify whether they should begin on 
[normal]S
[normal]tandard 
[normal]P
[normal]ayments or an APA
[normal]. The assessment 
[normal]should 
[normal]consider needs beyond money management and debt and cover financial literacy, access to appropriate financial products, and other circum
[normal]stances such as drug and alcohol addiction and debts. The assessment should result in a
[normal]n
[normal] understanding of how long it might take the claimant to build financial capability and what support is required
[normal] 
[normal]to make Standard Payments a realistic goal. 
[normal]Households should have the option to self-refer for an assessment for APAs, at any time in their 
[normal]UC
[normal] application.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Importantly, APAs should be used to prevent arrears occurring in the first place.[bold] [bold]Claimants who need A
[normal]PAs 
[normal]should be identified 
[normal]up-front 
[normal]in collaboration with landlords, 
[normal]Job Centre Plus, local authorities
[normal] and other
[normal] agencies to prevent them 
[normal]moving into arrears
[normal] – the Local Delivery Partnerships charged with making 
[normal]UC
[normal] work on the ground would be a natural lead for this
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A[bold]ll homeless [bold]households i[bold]n [bold]t[bold]emporary [bold]a[bold]ccommodation (TA) should[bold] automat[bold]ically receive APAs [bold]to ensure the [bold]housing [bold]component of [bold]UC[bold] [bold]is paid to [bold]the [bold]landlord until they move into settled accommodation. [bold]This 
[normal]will ensure landlords receive rent and t
[normal]hat people 
[normal]in TA
[normal],
[normal] who in the
[normal] vast majority of cases have already been found homeless
[normal],
[normal] do not get evicted and become homeless again.  
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Recommendations:[bold]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]All claimants should be assessed for financial capability[bold] at the start of their claim, and APAs [bold]put in place for those who are not ready for Standard Payments [bold]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]C[bold]laimants who need APAs upfront [bold]must be a priority;  Local Delivery Partnerships could lead on this [bold]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Households should have the option to self-refer [bold]for an assessment for A[bold]P[bold]As [bold]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]H[bold]ouseholds in TA [bold]should [bold]automatically receive APAs[bold].[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Universal Credit - 13 W[bold]eek [bold]P[bold]rotection[bold]&#xa0;[bold]5.1[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In a little discussed move, short-term protection against rent arrears for people who have recently lost their job will be abolished under [bold]UC[bold]. Currently if someone 
[normal]has not claimed 
[normal]housing benefit
[normal] in the previous 52 weeks and could afford their rent when they signed up to a tenancy, 
[normal]they can claim 
[normal]housing benefit
[normal] for their full rent for 13 weeks. Under the 
[normal]UC
[normal] this will be removed. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Housing benefit is subject to a num
[normal]ber of regulations that limit the amount that can be paid out. This frequently means that people eligible for 
[normal]housing benefit
[normal] are not able to claim sufficient support to cover their actual rent.
[normal] This is especially likely to affect private tenants as LHA ra
[normal]tes are purposely set below “average” rents. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A comparison of median rents across Broad Rental Market Areas and LHA rates shows that a family renting a typical three bedroom home would have to make up more than £100 a month in over a quarter (27%) of loca
[normal]l authority areas in England if the 13 week protection rule is abolished. In more than two in five (43%) of local authorities families will have a shortfall of more than £75 a month.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he 13 week protection rule
[normal] is intended to give people sufficient time t
[normal]o find work and resume paying their rent independently or, if their circumstances are unlikely to improve, make a planned move into cheaper accommodation. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.5[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The majority of people 
[normal]who lose their job 
[normal]will only experience a short-term spell of unemployment. 
[normal]Of the 325,000 unemployment claims that came to an end in June 2013, 53% of claimants were in receipt of JSA for 13 weeks or less
[normal]. Shelter’s concern is that without an adequate safety net, people will be unable to bounce back and will be anxious about how
[normal] they will pay their housing costs at a time when they should be focused on getting bac
[normal]k into work. For some, 
[normal]inadequate support will tip them into arrears, eviction and homelessness. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.6[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Recommendations:[bold]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 13 week protection rule must be replicated under [bold]UC[bold], in a way that is compatible[bold] with a unified benefit system[bold]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The DWP [bold]should [bold]publish an impact assessment of the loss of the 13 week protection rule. [bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]6[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Discretionary Housing Payments[bold]&#xa0;[bold]6.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Shelter is extremely concerned that Discretionary Housing Payments 
[normal](DHPs) are being called upon inappropriately to support people with a predictable and clearly defined additional need, when statutory regulations would be better placed to avoid unintended consequences.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2

[normal]Concerns with DHPs:[bold]They are discretionary[bold] - People cannot guarantee they will receive support, even if their circumstances are those that Ministers had in mind when releasing additional funding.  
[normal]They are short-term[bold] –
[normal] 
[normal]Although guidance does state that indefinite awards can be made if a claimant’
[normal]s circumstances are unlikely to change
[normal],
[normal] local authorities are wary of doing this as it makes it harder to budget. Where a shortfall is ongoing and predictable people shouldn’t have to go through repeated applications.
[normal]They are cash-limited[bold] – The allocation
[normal] of DHP given to local councils is cash limited and insufficient to respond to everyone with a shortfall. The need to make the budget last throughout the year can also encourage local authorities not to publicise DHPs or to reject applications earlier in t
[normal]he year in case of a surge in demand later. Local authorities can top-up the DWP allocation by 1.5 times but are legally prohibited from spending anything beyond this. Moreover, many are unable to do so because of pressures on their budgets.

[normal] (2012/13)
[normal]. In 2011/12 the average number of DHP applications per local authority was 274, i
[normal]t rose to 420 in 2012/13, and just in the first three months of 2013/14 an average of 294 DHP applications have been received per local authority. We therefore do not expect the historic trend of local authorities returning unspent DHP allocations to be re
[normal]peated.
