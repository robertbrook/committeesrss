"&#xa0;\nWritten Evidence from Dr Ben Worthy [OD 27]The UK government’s recent National Action plan\n reassert\ns\n the aim of making the UK government the ‘most open and transparent government in the world’.\n \nIt is ‘leading the world on Open D\nata’\n to bring about ‘\neconomic, social and political progress\n’. However, the broad aims of the transparency a\ngenda raise a number of uncertainties\n that could undermine the goals of the reforms\n.\nThe Uncertainties of Open DataThe first \nuncertainty\n \nconcerns \nwhich\n of the ‘economic, social and political’ aims the government supports. Observers have noted a shift in emphasis from \nthe \ndemocratic\n aims of government transparency and accountability\n to \nthe \neconomic\n aims of encouraging growth\n.\n Although originally inspired\n by \nthe \nMPs’ expenses\n scandal\n,\n there is an increasing\n emphasis on the\nse\n ‘\neconomic’ \nobjectives\n, \ndemonstrated by \nDavid Cameron’s \ncommitments \nat the 2013 G8\n meeting\n on tax transparency. \nJonathan Gray made the point after the OGP that \n‘\nThe Prime M\ninister's \nspeech typified a broader trend in open government discourse, away from political accountability and social justice and towards economic growth, digital innovation and supporting startups’.\nThis\n shift\n could lead to an obscuring of the other benefits of Op\nen Data. \nAmong the many possible effects of the reforms, \nOpen Data or Big Data could revolutionise\n how policy is delivered\n.\n This aim\n is\n \nlikely to attract support \nfrom public bodies\n that\n could\n quickly\n se\ne\n \nthe ben\ne\nfits\n of having detailed street-level data on\n resources, problems and policy\n impact\n.\n Its neglect in \nthe government\n’s new\n narrative would weaken a powerful lever for encouraging public bodies to co-operate. \nThe s\ne\ncond \nuncertainty\n concern\ns\n \nexactly\n what results the \ngovernment\n \nexpects\n to see. Measuring\n \na \ngeneral \n‘\ncultural ch\na\nn\nge’\n towards openness or ‘communi\nty empowerment’ is difficult. The data\n is unlikely to\n produce many \nhigh profile \nexamples of\n citizen\ns\n using the data, so called \nArmchair \nA\nuditors\n given the lack of comparable data or mechanism\ns\n of accountability\n. \nTh\nis leads to the\n third \nuncertainty:\n how \nare \nthe benefits \nsupposed to happen?\n \nThe \nemphasis \non \nOpen\n \nData\n as an \n‘\nenabler\n’ of involvement or participation\n is slightly misleading. \nThere remains confusion about how exactly Open Data can be \nused-who, for example, should an unhappy citizen send their unearthed misspending to? How could it \nthen \nbe used to rectify \na situation \nor hold \na body \nto account? \nFor \nOpen Data\n to work it needs to fit alongside \nnew \naccountability \nmechanisms\n, feedback system\ns or means of participating\n. \nT\nhe promised new ‘\nlocalism\n’ mechanism\ns\n that could help the data to work\n at local level\n, such as community budgeting, \nare yet to appear\n.\n \n&#xa0;ConsequencesThe\nse\n uncertainties bring \npossible knock on effects for all the key groups \ninvolved\n,\n from politicians to\n \npublic bodies and the public. \nFor politicians the danger is that, like \noccurred with \nFOI, \nambitious \nbut vague\n aims may lead to disappointment and lack of interest.\n Although the Action Plan speaks of the government becoming mo\nre en\nthusiastic about\n Open Data, politicians \ngenerally lose their zeal \ntowards openness\n \nand only support it on their own terms. Some interviewees were concerned that the ‘economic’ emphasis involved strengthening the hand of private bidders\n and led to media portrayal\ns\n of public bodies as ‘wasters’ of public money\n.\n \nIncreased accountability \ncould\n be a mixed blessing for a Minister, especially if directed at them or their government\n and may encourage distortion or ‘spin’\n.\n \nD\nespite its presenta\ntion as a ‘neutral’ \noutcome\n of technology, Open Data is very political. \nFor public bodies the lack of clarity on aims or outcomes is likely to lead to a range of i\nmplementation difficulties. \nS\no\nm\ne local authorities are \n‘\nexperimenters\n’, willing to adapt and\n innovate with data. However, without clear aims or goals\n many \nbodies \nare likely, at a time of cuts, to pursue a policy of minimal compliance\n and simply put out\n \nraw\n data\n on\n their\n websites. In extreme cases, as seen with some US departments, bodies may simp\nly release ‘old’ or non-valuable information\n.\n \nThis\n also\n means that the \nexperiments\n \nand\n innovations \nthat could attract the public won’t take place. Given such \nmixed signals and lack of enthusiasm, \nthe public themselves may \nlose interest\n. \nIn the US a simil\nar story of lack of clarity and\n low \ncompliance\n lead to low public uptake or interest. \nThe scenario is not inevitable. A greater clarity about the aims and expectations of Open Data would assist those whose co-operation and enthusiasm is needed. \nThe lesson\n from other transparency reforms is that leadership, clarity and innovation makes for \nmore \nsuccessful systems. \n  \n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n See \nThe National Action Plan \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/255901/ogp_uknationalactionplan.pdf\n \nBen Worthy (2013) \n‘David Cameron’s Transparency Revolution?’ \nhttp://campus.hec.fr/global-transparency/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Worthy-D\navid-Camerons-Transparency-revolution-FINAL.pdf\nJonathan Gray\n ‘\nOpen Government Partnership should foster accountability and social justice\n’, 4\nth\n Nov 2013\n \nhttp://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/nov/04/open-government-social-justice-david-cameron\n See Giles \nMoss\n and Stephen\n Coleman\n (2013)\n ‘Deliberative Manoeuvres in the Digital Darkness: e‐Democracy Policy in the UK’.\n&#xa0;\nThe British Journal of Politics &amp; International Relations\n.
