Written evidence submitted by Oxfam Scotlanddefault&#xa0;defaultOxfam Scotland welcomes the opportunity to input into th
defaultis
default call for evidence on land reform in Scotland. Oxfam works to overcome poverty all over the world, and believes that in a rich country such as the UK the existence of poverty is completely unacceptable.  Oxfam’s vision is that women and men who experience 
defaultpoverty in the UK are enabled to exercise their rights to a decent and secure standard of living.  In the UK, we work to overcome poverty in three ways: we develop projects with people living in poverty to improve their lives and show how things can change
default; we raise public awareness of poverty to create pressure for change; and we work with policy makers to tackle the causes of poverty.
default&#xa0;
defaultOur 
defaultprogramme 
defaultwork in Scotland involves partnering a range of community
default groups to support them build on
default their assets – whe
defaultther that be their social relations, their health and skills, their physical environment or their financial assets. 
default 
defaultMuch of our response to this call for evidence is inform
defaulted by our partner’s experience – 
defaultparticularly in post-industrial urban environments
default. 
defaultKey points:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe need for land reform in defaultpost-industrdefaultial communitiesdefault&#xa0;defaultFor Oxfam, the starting point for effective land reform needs to be a recognition that political and economic change in Scotland has delivered for the better off, but has simultaneously generated substantial poverty, an intensification of t
defaulthe way in which it is experienced and its concentration in particular localities.
default In Linwood and Clydebank, where two of Oxfam’s partners work, the experience is one of post-industrial decline when industry goes elsewhere. The result is not only the loss 
defaultof jobs (in Clydebank 1 in 40 people compete for every full time job)
default but associated individual, social and physical breakdown. Despite Oxfam’s partners wishing to utilise vacant and derelict land for the benefit of the community, this is often hindered b
defaulty a lack of clarity about who owns land and property. The case of Tesco in Linwood is indicative in this context.
default&#xa0;
defaultEvery little £20 million helpsdefaultMultinational supermarket chain Tesco (the UK’s largest private sector employer
default) has recently been accused of 
defaultusing its economic power to impose its plans on the community of Linwood, near Glasgow.
default Linwood was once home to a large Chrysler factory, the closure of which
default led to 13,000 job losses. By 1995, Linwood had one of the UK’s highest unemployment rates. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTe
defaultsco acquired a shopping centre from Balmore Properties. In 2001, Balmore purchased Linwood Town Centre for £1.7 million, selling it to Tesco for the same amount in 2007.
default It is claimed that Balmore 
defaultwas acting as an agent for Tesco. It 
defaultis further claimed 
defaultth
defaulte
defaulty
default 
defaultallowed the area to fall into disrepair as some retailers were evicted and others refused lease extensions, leading to closures, desertion and eventual disrepair, graffiti and anti-social behaviour.
default,
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultTesco created a ‘Love Linwood Group’, stating that
default it undertook ‘rigorous consultation… with Linwood residents’,
default asserting it would ‘regenerate Linwood, bringing not only a Tesco store, but many jobs for the long term unemployed and a new health centre and library.’
default It promised a £20 million development
default, including public offices and community facilities, and gifted £500,000 for refurbishment of a health centre.
default In November 2010, Tesco announced the plans would be re-submitted as they would no longer contain a health centre. In June 2011, Tesco received 
defaultofficial approval for its plans, however legal matters delayed progress and in April 2012 Tesco announced a new timeline. Development is now expected to be complete in 2014.
default&#xa0;
defaultTesco’s engagement left community members feeling misled, marginalised, ignored a
defaultnd disempowered.
default They feel Tesco’s agenda was imposed, with only the details up for discussion.
defaultNow the Linwood community is fighting back. Linwood Coalition (bringing together Linwood Focus, Community Council, the Housing Association, churches and footba
defaultll clubs) was formed in 2011 to protect community facilities.
default The Linwood Community Development Trust – an Oxfam partner – has helped local people develop their own community action plan – reaching out to more than 2,000 residents - demanding affordable c
defaultommunity space and the services local people want and need.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe lack of clarity concerning land ownership means that too often communities are left guessing who owns the land that they live, work and socialise in. The disparity of power means communities 
defaultare beholden to benevolent land owners and large economic actors.  A further example that illustrates this is that of Oxfam’s partners - EADHA – a social enterprise based in Lochwinnoch in 
defaultRenfrewshire that seeks to ‘unlock potential through planting trees
default to regenerate land and communities’.
default&#xa0;
defaultReclaiming Land for WoodlanddefaultEadha
default secured funding from GSGN to explore the restoration of a major site in East Ayrshire – the investigation enabled trial planting of aspen as a means of reclaiming relatively poor post mining land as well as a mapping of the ownership of this land with a v
defaultiew to developing community enterprises and wildlife habitat corridors as part of the restoration plans. The outcomes of this work highlighted challenges in Scotland in determining who owns land and the potentially significant costs of finding out via the 
defaultRegisters of Scotland – there were 8,087 titles in the specified area and a search of the records would have cost £3 per record (£24,260) plus three days of staff time (£780) a whopping £25,041, needless to say we were not able to proceed with this search.
default The original communities based on this land have long since gone, moved on as a result of the industry to extract resources. Plans are now underway to restore the land from its current scared and ravaged state but it is almost impossible for local communi
defaultties to develop a stake in this process as there is no obligation to inform or consult them of changes afoot or active promotion of the community right to buy a stake in the process. The Scottish Government is keen to support community ownership and an enh
defaultanced stake in regeneration but the reality of how these processes work make it almost impossible for communities to get involved, easier low cost mechanisms for finding out who owns land would assist with the development process as well as making new oppo
defaultrtunities easier to identify. Support to communities in exploring these opportunities would help to level the playing field.
default&#xa0;
defaultMany of the post-industrial communities where Oxfam works are in desperate need of the means to create robust local economies. In 
defaultOxfam’s experience, c
defaultollective business models such as community ownership can be used to share prosperity,
default allowing communities and employees to own and control their assets.
default Ownership of 
defaultland and 
defaultassets 
defaultcan
default generate income that bolsters the local econo
defaultmy. Crucially, the community decides where surpluses are spent, so money is retained locally (leading to further investment and multiplying benefits).
default 
defaultThe c
defaulturrent
default system that favours rural highland and island communities represents a missed opportunity t
defaulto provide urban communities with assets through which to create income streams and facilities much needed by their communities
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultTransferring public land to communitiesdefault&#xa0;defaultI
defaultn the communities where Oxfam works there is evidence of latent potential for community benefit in the inefficient, underutilised and wasteful use of public land and assets. This constitutes a missed economic potential and often creates a physical blight o
defaultn the community which becomes dispiriting and undermines other activity in the area. Oxfam believes that transfer of land or assets can be a mechanism to support communities, to give them autonomy, economic independence and community participation, while m
defaulteasures to address structural causes of poverty are undertaken. 
default&#xa0;
defaultYet the transfer of land or assets needs to be done in the correct manner. In Oxfam’s experience of transfers (evident in Linwood, for example), communities are compelled to raise significant
default sums of money to buy an asset from the local council. This provides the council with a capital receipt and simultaneously necessitates that the community then establishes an enterprise to generate income to pay off the loan for the purchase and then inves
defaultt to meet identified community needs. In the meantime, the council can use the money it earned in selling the a
defaultsset to the community to invest
default. 
defaultGiven 
defaultthat public services should, by definition, reflect the needs of local communities, o
defaultur concern is that fo
defaultr the poorest communities this in essence means that the community is raising money to pay the council for a public asset that, for whatever reason, the council failed to maintain or invest in. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAnother relevant issue is that in order to obtain 
defaultfunding for
default certain community initiatives
default,
default 
defaultf
defaultunders often seek demonstration of ownership or a long term lease. 
defaultFor example, the experience of our partners in 
defaultBeith 
defaultwas that when applying to the
default Scottish Government’s Climate Challenge Fund
default 
default(CCF) 
defaultthey were required to 
defaultprovide
default evidence that the community owned a football clubhouse before the community was deeme
defaultd eligible for a CCF grant. This begs two questions:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThese issues need to 
defaultbe addressed first and foremost, otherwise an urban right to buy public sector 
defaultland and 
defaultassets 
defaultrisks 
defaulta transfer of liabilities to communities without any guarantee that the income generated for the council will be invested as communities wish. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOxfam belie
defaultves
default the focus should be the public sector underwriting community solutions – providing them with the premises, space, resources (including finance) to develop their initiatives.
default 
defaultIn this way, land and assets can become 
defaulta mechanism to initiate and support lo
defaultcal economic development when used to keep resources in communities and build robust local economies
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe would also support shifting the onus to a right to buy private property at certain junctures and to a wider range of public bodies (not simply local au
defaultthorities but health, enterprise and forestry, for example) to help ensure community priorities are brought to the fore.
default&#xa0;defaultConclusiondefaultScotland needs a community-led economy underpinned by redistribution of power via substantial community participation in dec
defaultision-making and agenda-setting, with a state that underwrites community solutions.
default We hope the Committee’s 
defaultInquiry 
defaulthelps us move towards this.
