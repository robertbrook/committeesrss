Written evidence submitted by Oxfam Scotland[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Oxfam Scotland welcomes the opportunity to input into th
[normal]is
[normal] call for evidence on land reform in Scotland. Oxfam works to overcome poverty all over the world, and believes that in a rich country such as the UK the existence of poverty is completely unacceptable.  Oxfam’s vision is that women and men who experience 
[normal]poverty in the UK are enabled to exercise their rights to a decent and secure standard of living.  In the UK, we work to overcome poverty in three ways: we develop projects with people living in poverty to improve their lives and show how things can change
[normal]; we raise public awareness of poverty to create pressure for change; and we work with policy makers to tackle the causes of poverty.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our 
[normal]programme 
[normal]work in Scotland involves partnering a range of community
[normal] groups to support them build on
[normal] their assets – whe
[normal]ther that be their social relations, their health and skills, their physical environment or their financial assets. 
[normal] 
[normal]Much of our response to this call for evidence is inform
[normal]ed by our partner’s experience – 
[normal]particularly in post-industrial urban environments
[normal]. 
[normal]Key points:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The need for land reform in [bold]post-industr[bold]ial communities[bold]&#xa0;[bold]For Oxfam, the starting point for effective land reform needs to be a recognition that political and economic change in Scotland has delivered for the better off, but has simultaneously generated substantial poverty, an intensification of t
[normal]he way in which it is experienced and its concentration in particular localities.
[normal] In Linwood and Clydebank, where two of Oxfam’s partners work, the experience is one of post-industrial decline when industry goes elsewhere. The result is not only the loss 
[normal]of jobs (in Clydebank 1 in 40 people compete for every full time job)
[normal] but associated individual, social and physical breakdown. Despite Oxfam’s partners wishing to utilise vacant and derelict land for the benefit of the community, this is often hindered b
[normal]y a lack of clarity about who owns land and property. The case of Tesco in Linwood is indicative in this context.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Every little £20 million helps[bold]Multinational supermarket chain Tesco (the UK’s largest private sector employer
[normal]) has recently been accused of 
[normal]using its economic power to impose its plans on the community of Linwood, near Glasgow.
[normal] Linwood was once home to a large Chrysler factory, the closure of which
[normal] led to 13,000 job losses. By 1995, Linwood had one of the UK’s highest unemployment rates. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Te
[normal]sco acquired a shopping centre from Balmore Properties. In 2001, Balmore purchased Linwood Town Centre for £1.7 million, selling it to Tesco for the same amount in 2007.
[normal] It is claimed that Balmore 
[normal]was acting as an agent for Tesco. It 
[normal]is further claimed 
[normal]th
[normal]e
[normal]y
[normal] 
[normal]allowed the area to fall into disrepair as some retailers were evicted and others refused lease extensions, leading to closures, desertion and eventual disrepair, graffiti and anti-social behaviour.
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Tesco created a ‘Love Linwood Group’, stating that
[normal] it undertook ‘rigorous consultation… with Linwood residents’,
[normal] asserting it would ‘regenerate Linwood, bringing not only a Tesco store, but many jobs for the long term unemployed and a new health centre and library.’
[normal] It promised a £20 million development
[normal], including public offices and community facilities, and gifted £500,000 for refurbishment of a health centre.
[normal] In November 2010, Tesco announced the plans would be re-submitted as they would no longer contain a health centre. In June 2011, Tesco received 
[normal]official approval for its plans, however legal matters delayed progress and in April 2012 Tesco announced a new timeline. Development is now expected to be complete in 2014.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Tesco’s engagement left community members feeling misled, marginalised, ignored a
[normal]nd disempowered.
[normal] They feel Tesco’s agenda was imposed, with only the details up for discussion.
[normal]Now the Linwood community is fighting back. Linwood Coalition (bringing together Linwood Focus, Community Council, the Housing Association, churches and footba
[normal]ll clubs) was formed in 2011 to protect community facilities.
[normal] The Linwood Community Development Trust – an Oxfam partner – has helped local people develop their own community action plan – reaching out to more than 2,000 residents - demanding affordable c
[normal]ommunity space and the services local people want and need.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The lack of clarity concerning land ownership means that too often communities are left guessing who owns the land that they live, work and socialise in. The disparity of power means communities 
[normal]are beholden to benevolent land owners and large economic actors.  A further example that illustrates this is that of Oxfam’s partners - EADHA – a social enterprise based in Lochwinnoch in 
[normal]Renfrewshire that seeks to ‘unlock potential through planting trees
[normal] to regenerate land and communities’.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Reclaiming Land for Woodland[bold]Eadha
[normal] secured funding from GSGN to explore the restoration of a major site in East Ayrshire – the investigation enabled trial planting of aspen as a means of reclaiming relatively poor post mining land as well as a mapping of the ownership of this land with a v
[normal]iew to developing community enterprises and wildlife habitat corridors as part of the restoration plans. The outcomes of this work highlighted challenges in Scotland in determining who owns land and the potentially significant costs of finding out via the 
[normal]Registers of Scotland – there were 8,087 titles in the specified area and a search of the records would have cost £3 per record (£24,260) plus three days of staff time (£780) a whopping £25,041, needless to say we were not able to proceed with this search.
[normal] The original communities based on this land have long since gone, moved on as a result of the industry to extract resources. Plans are now underway to restore the land from its current scared and ravaged state but it is almost impossible for local communi
[normal]ties to develop a stake in this process as there is no obligation to inform or consult them of changes afoot or active promotion of the community right to buy a stake in the process. The Scottish Government is keen to support community ownership and an enh
[normal]anced stake in regeneration but the reality of how these processes work make it almost impossible for communities to get involved, easier low cost mechanisms for finding out who owns land would assist with the development process as well as making new oppo
[normal]rtunities easier to identify. Support to communities in exploring these opportunities would help to level the playing field.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Many of the post-industrial communities where Oxfam works are in desperate need of the means to create robust local economies. In 
[normal]Oxfam’s experience, c
[normal]ollective business models such as community ownership can be used to share prosperity,
[normal] allowing communities and employees to own and control their assets.
[normal] Ownership of 
[normal]land and 
[normal]assets 
[normal]can
[normal] generate income that bolsters the local econo
[normal]my. Crucially, the community decides where surpluses are spent, so money is retained locally (leading to further investment and multiplying benefits).
[normal] 
[normal]The c
[normal]urrent
[normal] system that favours rural highland and island communities represents a missed opportunity t
[normal]o provide urban communities with assets through which to create income streams and facilities much needed by their communities
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Transferring public land to communities[bold]&#xa0;[bold]I
[normal]n the communities where Oxfam works there is evidence of latent potential for community benefit in the inefficient, underutilised and wasteful use of public land and assets. This constitutes a missed economic potential and often creates a physical blight o
[normal]n the community which becomes dispiriting and undermines other activity in the area. Oxfam believes that transfer of land or assets can be a mechanism to support communities, to give them autonomy, economic independence and community participation, while m
[normal]easures to address structural causes of poverty are undertaken. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Yet the transfer of land or assets needs to be done in the correct manner. In Oxfam’s experience of transfers (evident in Linwood, for example), communities are compelled to raise significant
[normal] sums of money to buy an asset from the local council. This provides the council with a capital receipt and simultaneously necessitates that the community then establishes an enterprise to generate income to pay off the loan for the purchase and then inves
[normal]t to meet identified community needs. In the meantime, the council can use the money it earned in selling the a
[normal]sset to the community to invest
[normal]. 
[normal]Given 
[normal]that public services should, by definition, reflect the needs of local communities, o
[normal]ur concern is that fo
[normal]r the poorest communities this in essence means that the community is raising money to pay the council for a public asset that, for whatever reason, the council failed to maintain or invest in. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Another relevant issue is that in order to obtain 
[normal]funding for
[normal] certain community initiatives
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]f
[normal]unders often seek demonstration of ownership or a long term lease. 
[normal]For example, the experience of our partners in 
[normal]Beith 
[normal]was that when applying to the
[normal] Scottish Government’s Climate Challenge Fund
[normal] 
[normal](CCF) 
[normal]they were required to 
[normal]provide
[normal] evidence that the community owned a football clubhouse before the community was deeme
[normal]d eligible for a CCF grant. This begs two questions:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]These issues need to 
[normal]be addressed first and foremost, otherwise an urban right to buy public sector 
[normal]land and 
[normal]assets 
[normal]risks 
[normal]a transfer of liabilities to communities without any guarantee that the income generated for the council will be invested as communities wish. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Oxfam belie
[normal]ves
[normal] the focus should be the public sector underwriting community solutions – providing them with the premises, space, resources (including finance) to develop their initiatives.
[normal] 
[normal]In this way, land and assets can become 
[normal]a mechanism to initiate and support lo
[normal]cal economic development when used to keep resources in communities and build robust local economies
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We would also support shifting the onus to a right to buy private property at certain junctures and to a wider range of public bodies (not simply local au
[normal]thorities but health, enterprise and forestry, for example) to help ensure community priorities are brought to the fore.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Conclusion[bold]Scotland needs a community-led economy underpinned by redistribution of power via substantial community participation in dec
[normal]ision-making and agenda-setting, with a state that underwrites community solutions.
[normal] We hope the Committee’s 
[normal]Inquiry 
[normal]helps us move towards this.
