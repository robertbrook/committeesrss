"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Transport Watch UK (HSR 015)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTransport-Watch is an independent association not connected with any business or political\nparty initially funded \nby a trust and dedicated to making the best use of land already \ncommitted to transport in the interests of the Community as a whole.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWIDER ECONOMIC BENEFITSThe KMPG claimKPMG, acting for HS2 Ltd, claim that the \n“Y” \nnetwork, connecting \nLondon to Birmingham and Manchester and Birmingham to Nottingham, Sheffield and Leeds will generate £15bn per year in Wider Economic Benefits, the so called WEBs.\n This extraordinary value is circa 15 times higher than the annual value implied by the \n£\n13.3b\nn discounted value claimed in the October 2013 Economic Case\n.\nThe WEBSAll these WEBs\n, or nearly all, should be assigned to the generated or new trips since \nthe other trips, and most of their associated WEBs, would arise in the absence of the scheme.\nSource documentation suggests that the proposal is forecast to generate \ncirca \n98,800 new trips per day.\n \nDividing the £15bn by the 9\n8,8\n00\n \nand by the 300 effective days in the year provides £5\n0\n0 per trip, or £1,\n0\n00 for a round trip.  Multiplying the £5\n0\n0 \nby\n the 1,460 million trips carried by Network Rail in 2011/12\n generates circa £\n73\n0\n \nb\nillio\nn, a sum equal to half the nation’s GDP; clearly an impossibility, implying that the £15bn is wildly optimistic.\n  \nAlternatively the WEBs could be assigned to the gener\nated business and commuter trips alone.  \nSources\n suggest these are to \nnumber circa 3\n7\n,000 per day.\n \n \nDividing the £15bn by 3\n7\n,000 and the 300 days in the year yields £1,\n350\n, or £2,\n70\n0 for a round trip.  Multiplying the £1,\n35\n0 by the nation’s business plus \ncommuting trips provides an absurd £1\n4\n,\n3\n00 billion,\n some ten times the nation’s actual GDP, illustrating again how ludicrous it is that anyone should ever believe that the proposal could generate WEBs worth £15bn per year.\nNote particularly \nthat (a) these\n extraordinary WEBs are in excess of what would have arisen had the new passengers stayed in their offices or at home or gone elsewhere (b) that the new passengers are supposedly generated by reductions in journey times of 30 to 60 minutes\n (c) pre-existing trips on the West Coast Main line should have WEBs substantially above, perhaps double, those of the new and marginal trips\n.\n \nThat leaves HS2 Ltd to either (a) explain why a High Speed Rail trip, generated merely because a journey has be\nen shortened somewhat, should provide vastly more benefits than any other journey on the rail network ever could – a task made doubly difficult because\n, as above, \nthe benefits from a generated, or marginal, trip should be lower\n \nthan \n(perhaps half) \nthose as\nsociated with a pre-existing trip or (b) to throw the analysis into the waste paper basket.\n(\nThe \nC\nommittee \nwill \nsee from the footnotes \nthat the \na\nbove relies on \nour interpretation of \nthe \ntrip data \nin the Eco\nnomic \nAnaly\ns\nes\n of January 2012\n and October 2013\n,\n t\nhe forecasts r\ne\nport dated \nApril 2012\n and the National Travel Survey\n.  \nWe would have preferred to use the latest data available\n from HS2 Ltd itself\n.  To that end we asked HS2 Ltd for its \nestimate of generated trips and the pro\nportions of \nthose that may be f\nor bus\ni\nness and commuting\n.  We received \nthe astonishing reply that the data is not available; a state\nment \nwhich\n, on \nthe face of it, \nmust be \nfalse, since without the data it would seem impossible to calculate the alleged benefits\n)\n.\nOther benefitsWe have\n \nfr\nom table 22 of \nthe Economic case dated October 2013\n benefits \nsourced \nas follows:.\n(1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n£\n5.\n5\nbn from improved reliability, as though the trains cannot be made to run on time without building a high speed network\n, \n(2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n£\n6.6bn from a combination of improved access\n (\n£1.1bn\n)\n,\n \nimproved interchange\n (\n£4.1bn\n)\n,\n \nand \nr\neduced walking (\n£\n1.3bn\n)\n \nas though a hig\nh\n speed network is required achieve those\n.\n(3)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n£\n7.5bn \nfrom reduced crowding, largely solvable otherwise\n.  \nE.g. (i) add carriages and expect passengers to wa\nl\nk towards more cent\nral ones at stations where the platforms are too short, or (ii) raise the fares so as to reduce demand and lessen the vast financial loss which the railways make. After all\n,\n a\n \nbusiness in the private sector would do that\n.\n(4)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n£31bn from time savings, much of w\nhich remains contentious\n.\n  E.g. a bus\ni\nness man\n,\n if losing time\n,\n may well make it up out of his leisure time\n.\nThose dubious items total \n£\n45\nbn out of a total of \n£71bn. Our view is that at least half should be st\nr\nuck out\n, thereby destroying the “economic case\n”.\nKey and hidden assumptions.E\nmbedded within the a\nna\nly\ns\nis \nare two key assumptions, namely\n:\n(1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGDP drives growth in demand\n.\n \nThis assumption is difficult to sustain when it is realised that GDP grew, in real terms, by 160% between the 1955 and 1995 but that \nrail use grew not at all.  The implication is that the extraordinary growth since1995 is due to the razzamatazz of privatisation, aided by vast subsidies from the public purse; nothing at all to do with GDP and not likely to be sustained..\n(2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nV\nalues of time e\ntc\n.\n will inc\nr\neas\ne\n at clos\ne\n to 2% pa fo\nr\n ever and ever.\nThis seemingly trivial input \ndo\nu\nbles the comp\nuted \nben\ne\nf\ni\nts\n!\nA fundamental flaw.The analysis depends on the so \ncalled ‘Willingness to Pay Calculus’ \ndeveloped \nby Professor Sugden of the University of Ea\nst Anglia.  \nThat \n‘\ncalculus\n’\n \nenables the incremental fares\n, namely the \nHS2 fares minus those lost to HS2 by the rest of the ra\ni\nlway\n, \nto be subtracted from costs and for the difference to be \ncompared with the benefits.  \nThe problem is that the theory reduce\ns to the absurd when it is realised that changing the eco\nnomic \nboundary of the scheme (a matter that can be done at the stroke of a pen) \nwould\n change\n the incremental fares.  \nE.g. if we a\nssume the rest of the railway is proper\nl\ny privatised \nthen \nthe increm\nen\ntal fairs rise to the full HS2 fares.  \nAlternatively w\niden the boundary to capture losses suffered by the airlines and the increm\nen\nta\nl\n fares are reduced\n.\nT\nhe correct place to draw \nthe \nboundary is round the nation as a whole, not the Gove\nrnment as pretended\n in this analysis\n.  When th\ne bou\nndary is \nso widened \nthe incremental fares fall to zero since every pound spent on the railway is a pound lost elsewhere.\nStriking out the\nse\n fares would of course destroy the economic case for this scheme and for all railway\n \nprojects\n.\nPenalties.Our view is that penalties should be imposed upon those who have led these studies, irresponsible as they are in all their detail\n - putting tens of billions of P\nounds at risk. \nAt the least nobody should ever again believe data produc\ned by ARUP, Atkins, HS2\n Ltd\n, Greengauge or Network rail in connection with HS2, or any other railway project.  These people have\n, in our opinion,\n shamelessly misrepresented this scheme so misleading the Government on a mammoth scale, a sentiment taken f\nrom\n Stewart Joy’s book, \n‘\nThe Train that ran Away\n’\n.\n \n \nConclusion.Against that background we can\nvas \nfor a more straight\n \nforward approach, namely if it makes a financial loss, particularly if the loss is in the tens of billions, do not build it\n.\nFootnotes&#xa0;\n.\n The 13.3bn is the sum of the discounted values out to the year 2093.  It equates to circa £1 bn per year\n if the WEBs are held constant in real terms\n year to year\n.\n. \nThe Economic Assessment of January 2012 provides, at paragraph 3.2.1, 270,000 trips per day in and out of \nLondon\n plus 110,000 inter-regional trips, a total of 380,000.  Table 12 of the October 2013 Economic case provides 26% of trips as new, or generated. \n Hence we have 98,800 generated.  £15bn divided by 98,800 and by 300 days provides £506 or £1,012 per round trip.  Note the 26% is higher than the 24% cited in Table 2 of the January 2012 assessment.\n. \n The ORR stats provide 1,460 million network rail jou\nrneys in 2011-12.  1,460 million times £500 \n(the supposedly WEB associated with each generated trip) \nprovides £730 billion, roughly half the nation’s GDP\n.\n. \n The Demand and Appraisal report for HS2 to the \nWest Midlands\n, WS Atkins, April 2012, provides at,\n paragraph 6.4.8, that 30% of trips are business trips.  We have from note 1 above 98,800 generated trips.  Hence there are likely to be 98,800 x 0.3 = 29,640 \ngenerated business trips.  \nT\nable 0407\n of the \nN\national \nT\nravel \nS\nurvey\n provides 5% of trips purposes\n as commuting and 19% as business for journey lengths between 100 and 150 miles, and 3% and 19% respectively for lengths between 150 and 250 miles.  That suggests that business plus commuter trips via HS2 may amount to the business trips plus 25%, providin\ng 37,050. \n. \n National Travel Survey\n, NTS, \ndata provides 177 commuter trips and business trips per head by all modes in 2012\n.  Multiplying by the population of 60 million and by the £1,350 per generated business plus commuter trip estimated above provide\ns an absurd £14,300 billion.\n. \n The classical argument is that the first trip to be generated by a reduction in journey time, or cost, enjoys the same benefit as do pre-existing trips but that the last trip so attracted is entirely marginal and hence takes no benefit from the cost reduc\ntion.  Hence the benefit assigned to each generated trips is typically half that assigned to each pre-existing trip.  This argument may apply equally to the WEBs..\n. \n See also the Transport-watch web site topic 24 \nhttp://www.transport-watch.co.uk/topic-24-nata-refresh-and-burger-bar\n \n.  Joy was Chief Economist to British Railways in the late 1960’s or early 1970’s.  \nIn his\n book\n,\n ‘The Train that ran Away’\n,\n he wrote that …\n. \n“\nThere were those in the British Transport Commission and the Railways, who were cynically prepared to accept the unpalatable task of tricking the Government on a mammoth scale.  Those men”, Joy wrote, “were either fools or knaves”.  There were no libel \nactions but Joy had been forced out.\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n"
