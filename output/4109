[normal]Written evidence from Harriet Harman (CYS0073)
[normal]I’m very pleased that you are 
[normal]holding 
[normal]this inquiry
[normal] into cycle safety and I’d like to take the opportunity to
[normal] set out my concerns and 
[normal]proposals for change
[normal].
[normal] It is an issue of great concern to people in my constituency of Camberwell and Peckham who use cycling for work and leisure
[normal],
[normal] and was especially brought
[normal] to light o
[normal]n the 17
[normal]th
[normal] November
[normal] by the tragic death of a 
[normal]cyclist in 
[normal]Camberwell 
[normal]who was 
[normal]hit by a lorry at 
[normal]the
[normal] junction 
[normal]of
[normal] Albany 
[normal]Road 
[normal]and Camberwell Road. 
[normal]Richard Muzira was the sixth cyclist to die on London’s roads within a fortnight. First and foremost h
[normal]is death is a tragedy for his family and friends but six deaths in the same month is a warning sign that we must do something to protect cyclists.
[normal]Safe cycling is good healthy exercise, is cheaper than public transport and cuts congestion and pollution. Go
[normal]ods need to be delivered in London 
[normal]and that means having lorries and HGV’s on our roads alongside cyclists and other road users. 
[normal]Cyclists will sometimes make decisions on the road that are risky for themselves and also for pedestrians – jumping red lights
[normal], not signalling, or moving across fast-moving traffic in an unexpected way. But we can’t solve the problem of cycling safety by blaming cyclists. Nor should we stigmatise all lorry drivers. What we need is sensible, evidence based solutions.
[normal]I strongly ba
[normal]ck Southwark Council’s call for a ban on HGV’s for one hour during the morning and evening rush hours – a ‘safe cycling hour’ without lorries on the roads. 
[normal]One in five cyclist deaths involve lorries even though lorries are only 6% of traffic on the roads. 
[normal]Fourteen cyclists have died this year; nine involved with 
[normal]lorries or 
[normal]HGV’s. 
[normal]I’m concerned to hear that some people are no longer cycling to work because of concern for their safety. 
[normal]A rush hour lorry ban would give confidence to people who are not cycling 
[normal]now because of their safety
[normal].
[normal]I also support 
[normal]Labour’s proposal for a voluntary HGV Safety Charter. 
[normal]The charter w
[normal]ould
[normal] require HGV operators to sign up to a range of safety measures. By the middle of next year, we want to see all new and existing HGVs fitted with safety measures including rear-view cameras, reversing alarms and day time running lights. 
[normal]I think it would b
[normal]e a good idea that b
[normal]y the end of 2017
[normal] all
[normal] HGVs 
[normal]are 
[normal]fitted with in-cab warning systems for drivers, side
[normal]-
[normal]guards and blind-spot elimination devices. The voluntary charter is an immediate step that w
[normal]ould
[normal] be backed up by legislation making these safety measure
[normal]s compulsory for HGVs, if Labour wins the next election.
[normal]I hope that your inquiry and report will be important for encouraging and helping cyclists, and making sure they don’t have to pay with their lives.
