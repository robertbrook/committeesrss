[normal]Vehicle technology is advancing quickly, and systems that interact with their surroundings and with other vehicles are becoming increasingly common. These technologies create the opportunity for vehicles that can autonomously manage actions that are currently reserved for the driver and could, in the future, be able to carry out all of the driver tasks. The UK has a fantastic opportunity to be at the forefront of these developments”

[normal]In our report on Transport and the economy we called for the 
[normal]DfT
[normal] to publish a strategy to explain what the Government aims to achieve by spending money on transport and how its policies support these aims. The department dismissed our recommendation, pointing us to the lists of actions in the business plan. The business plan is a useful and informative document but it does little more than list transport policies and target dates for implementation. It sits in a strategic vacuum and can easily be overtaken by events

[normal]“A Conservative Government will support proposals along the lines of the plan put forward by engineering firm, Arup, for a new Heathrow rail hub. This would link Heathrow terminals directly into the main rail network and the lines to Reading, Oxford, Bristol, Plymouth, Cardiff, Swansea, Cheltenham and Southampton, greatly improving public transport links to the airport. The plan would also include construction of a new high speed link connecting Heathrow airport to the Channel Tunnel Rail link and the new route north, providing a viable alternative to thousands of short haul flights now clogging up the airport”

In Kent, the route of HS1 was amended to avoid the AONB … and run beside the existing M20, a major strategic transport corridor which reduced incremental noise pollution and landscape damage. By contrast, HS2 appears to have been deliberately routed through the least spoilt, widest part of the Chilterns”

[normal]Mr
[normal] Simon Burns:
[normal] As part of the Government's comprehensive spending review in 2010, £773 million was allocated to the development of the High Speed 2 Project. This has increased to around £900 million, primarily due to an increase in the capital budget relating to property compensation. This increase reflects the forthcoming introduction, subject to the outcome of the recent consultation, of long-term discretionary and statutory compensation schemes for Phase One. The increase in budget was notified to HM Treasury as part of the Department's main estimate submissions at the beginning of

[normal]The Department has forecast that phase one will result in reduced operating costs on the existing network of £3.0 billion (discounted) over 60 years.
