"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Susan Morrow (IPC0003)My name is Susan Morrow . I am a retired science teacher and an  amateur \nmeterologist\n/\nclimatoligist\nAs a follower of climate issues\nwww.weathercycles.wordpress\n&#xa0;\nI feel a basic organisational flaw is \ninherant\n in the organisation called the IPCC..\nThe IPCC is 100% AGW lobbyists/scientists\nThere are many other climate groups/ scientists that are 100% the opposite. \nTHey\n are 100% AGW sceptics\nThe supposed AGW consensus is a fallacy\nA true outlook on future\n climate cannot be achieved until the reports incorporate both sides of the debate\nYou must recognise that the IPCC is 100% biased and committed to \nAGWscience\n alone and pays little to no attention to natural variability\nTHe\n 100% reliance on computer climat\ne simulations is worrying.. \nTHey\n are beta products \nuntrialled\n and unproven\nTHe\n IPCC research is selected and chosen with an affirmative position ONLY!!\nYou need to \nincorportae\n some of the oppositions science to get a balance of the true body of knowledge o\nf climate science\nThe climate journals are controlled by AGW \nprotaganists\n and alternative science is squashed or hidden is so called sub standard journals\nTHank\n goodness this input/submission  is a start to governments thinking about the alternative views \nof many climate scientists who are not AGW advocates\nIf the UK met office wants to lead world climate research . \nTHey\n will not shun and demoralise alternative research.!. \nEmply\n some AGW \nskeptics\n on an  equal basis!!\nClimate models should NOT be the main so\nurce of climate prediction this early in their developmen\nt\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
