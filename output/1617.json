But the number of loans actually secured is far short of an acceptable level due to bank criteria to lend being purposely impossible to meet, meanwhile, the question remains are the bank using this ploy to secure money from government for th\neir own benefit which they may not have to return?\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
