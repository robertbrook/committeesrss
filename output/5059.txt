[[[&#xa0;]]]Given the difficulties of ensuring appropriate welfare standards for primates kept as pets, I am strongly opposed to such a practice.  Primates have very specific housing and husbandry requirements given their cognitive, social and emotional complexity. It is extremely difficult to provide appropriate levels of care to primates, and together with conservation concerns, and health risks to humans, I am strongly opposed to the keeping of primates as pets and in breeding and trading for these purposes.

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.1 The extent of the trade and keeping of primates as pets within the UK; RSPCA figures from 2009 indicate there are between 2500-7500 primates kept by private individuals in Great Britain. The range in figures is indicative that there is little regulation or understanding of the conditions in which pet primates are kept. 2.2 Whether the existing regulatory framework and Code of Practice offer adequate protection for the welfare of primates kept as pets  and are being applied effectively; and &#xa0;The Code of Practice is too general – each species of primate has specific needs, and combined with lack of regulation and inspection the Code does not provide an acceptable mechanism for ensuring adequate welfare standards. Owners need very specialist knowledge and training.2.3 Whether people should be allowed to keep primates as pets and, if not, how a ban might be implemented. 2.3.1               I personally support the

[[[ ]]]International Primatological Society Policy on Private Ownership of Nonhuman Primates

[[[ ]]](http://www.internationalprimatologicalsociety.org/PrivateOwnershipOfNonHumanPrimates.cfm) which opposes the keeping of nonhuman primates in captivity by individuals for any non-scientific, non-certified educational or non-registered/accredited sanctuary purposes, including the possession of nonhuman primates as pets or companion animals as well as engaging in importation, breeding and trading for these purposes.2.3.2 Animals kept in captivity are reliant on humans for their care and welfare. Enclosure design and choice of group mates as well as routine husbandry events such as feeding, cleaning, and health care are in the hands of human keepers. To provide adequate housing and husbandry to ensure good welfare, those responsible need expert knowledge, training, and a network of individuals to ensure appropriate care is provided. For example, primates must be housed in socially compatible groups to ensure good welfare, but evictions or deaths may occur, leaving the unacceptable possibility of single housing. Such networks (as good zoos have) are vital to ensure animals are placed in optimal captive conditions.2.3.3 Primates have complex cognitive, social and emotional requirements and can suffer from boredom, lack of appropriate social and physical stimulation and challenge. In particular, an appropriate early rearing environment is needed; primates can develop stereotypies, abnormal and self-injurious behaviours, if not properly reared. Several practices used in the pet trade, such as hand-rearing, are likely to lead to psychological damage and suffering.2.3.4 Over half of the (around) 400 primate species and subspecies for which information on conservation status is available are threatened with extinction (the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species). Even though many primates currently held as pets will have been bred in captivity, they are not domesticated, like cats or dogs, and are inappropriate as pets. Unless curbed, the continuing demand of primates as pets may result in the unacceptable practice of illegal capture and trade of individuals from the wild, with concomitant welfare and conservation consequences.2.3.5 Primates can pose a significant threat to humans, through bite wounds or disease (e.g. simian herpes B virus). 2.3.6  I strongly encourage a ban of keeping primates be put in place.
