"&#xa0;\nSupplementary written evidence from Chris \nBazlinton\n (SLC 044)\nI am just writing to thank you for giving us the opportunity to present our experience and thoughts at the hearings of the Transport Select Committee on level crossing safety.\nI am concerned about evidence given by Robin \nGisby\n at the second hearing on Monday 4 November.\n&#xa0;\n During his evidence he ‘revealed’ that:\n\"I do not know why those things [the ‘missing’ \nHudd\n memo and risk assessment Part B] were not produced. They certainly should have been; they were somewhere within the \norganisation\n, and we have investigated why they did not come out until much later in the day, as have other \norganisations\n. I think that was covered by the judge when Network Rail was sentenced. I think it was also covered in the ORR investigation.\" \n&#xa0;\nTSC evidence 4 November 2013 \n&#xa0;\nQ161\nThe reason that I am concerned about this is that it is the first I have heard of any internal investigation.\n&#xa0;\n We met David Higgins shortly after the missing documents appeared in 2011.\n&#xa0;\n He assured us that everything Network Rail had would be given to us, and I believe he did.\n&#xa0;\n But as I say, we were never told of any internal inquiry.\n&#xa0;\n Either we were yet again fobbed off, or Network Rail never did carry out an inquiry\n&#xa0;\n - I suspect the latter.\nThe second part of that quote relates to the fact that the judge for some reason announced that there was no suggestion of a cover-up – yet no-one has ever carried out an investigation on whether there was a cover-up or not.\n&#xa0;\n ORR certainly did not – their role was to investigate the breaches of Health and Safety legislation within Network Rail and they have told me they were unable to get any answers other than ‘don’t know’ from the people they questioned about what went wrong.\n&#xa0;\n They certainly did not exonerate Network Rail.\n&#xa0;\n The “other \norganisations\n” \nGisby\n referred to are RSSB and RAIB – neither of these investigated why the documents had not appeared.\nGisby\n, of course, has been Head of Operations at Network Rail from before the accident at \nElsenham\n until now, and therefore - ultimately - the officer responsible for any failings.\n&#xa0;\n If he did not know what went on, then his performance as a manager must be brought into question.\nI do not wish to be vindictive about this but it seems that he and other people at Network Rail have not taken the responsibility they should.\n&#xa0;\n Another senior person who has failed, I believe, is Richard Smith, Network Rail’s solicitor.\n&#xa0;\n From documents provided by ORR under Freedom of Information we know that he had possession of the \nHudd\n Memo in February 2011 at the latest (we believe he probably knew back in 2006) but it did not ‘appear’ until March 2011 when it was eventually handed to David Higgins who passed it on to us.\nI do exclude David Higgins from any responsibility – of course, he was not there until 2011 and the matter only became public in the week he arrived at Network Rail.\n&#xa0;\n And without his support I suspect Network Rail would have put up a fight.\n&#xa0;\n As it was, he insisted that the organization was guilty – he made this known to staff, some of whom in 2012 were saying that Network Rail had only pleaded guilty for ‘political’ and ‘PR’ reasons.\nI appreciate that there is a lot of minutiae in all this but unfortunately, some of the devil is in the detail in our case.\nFor me, this is an issue of accountability – no one has so far taken responsibility.\n&#xa0;\n The response seems to be merely a shrug of the shoulders.\nI do hope the committee in its report will make some reference to this.\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
