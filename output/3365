defaultSummary
default1.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultEvidence of success against the ‘Nicholson Challenge’ remains difficult to measure. Productivity gains based on activity may not be an appropriate measure for a service that should be focused on outcomes.
default1.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultLocal Age UK projects suggest there is an appetite to establish new ways of working, but we are not convinced this is sufficiently widespread throughout the NHS.
default1.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultNet expenditure on older people’s social care continues to fall. Average charges are increasing and eligibility is tightening. There remains a huge gap in recognition of the importance of maintaining effective social care.
default1.4.
default&#xa0; 
defaultPro-active and preventative care is under-provided by the NHS in key areas relevant to older people. Radical change to how care is organised must start by making such approaches the norm.
default1.5.
default&#xa0; 
defaultNHS England must be given stability in order to establish new ways of working. Annual changes to the NHS Mandate must be the exception rather than the rule.
default2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAge UK’s evidence to the Health  Committee on public expenditure in 2011 set out a number of key points and recommendations. In answering the questions outlined for the 2013 inquiry, this response will briefly reflect on progress against these recommendations (included below in italics).
default3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAge UK is concerned by emerging evidence that the ‘Nicholson Challenge’ is being met by the blunt instrument of cost cutting with local authorities and PCTs seeking to restrict eligibility and access to care instead of implementing new ways of working.
default3.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThough we believe there are some pockets of good practice in the NHS, including some areas working well with local Age UKs, progress is incredibly difficult to measure. 
default3.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWhere for example a recent paper indicated 3.2% productivity gains in 2010/11
default, we have concerns that such approaches may not take sufficient account of outcomes. Other well-established models such as a production of welfare approach could provide a more meaningful measure of quality of life. This should be the main concern of delivering efficiency gains – demonstrating that inputs achieve positive changes in quality of life.
default3.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThere remains distinct local variation in access to treatment. A recent parliamentary question
default revealed there is up to a six fold difference in access to key surgical procedures that are known to be effective in older people. 
default3.4.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIssues with social care funding (see 4) do not give us confidence that new ways of working are being attempted on a widespread basis. The combined challenges of shrinking social care funding; tightening eligibility criteria; and implementing NHS 
defaultreforms is making it extremely difficult for commissioners to innovate, particularly as some areas may be more risk averse given the lack of future funding growth
default.
default3.5.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe are encouraged by work local Age UKs are doing with commissioners. A major project in Cornwall is looking to integrate health and social care approaches with the voluntary sector, all based around care planned in partnership with patients. Other examples in Hillingdon have seen Age UK volunteers supporting older people accessing A&amp;E.
default3.6.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWhile it is absolutely right that the effectiveness of such services should be evaluated, there are not always the appropriate metrics or frameworks to demonstrate this to commissioners’ satisfaction. More needs to be done to make sure innovation funds can support such projects and a higher value should be placed on being able to demonstrate person-centred outcomes.
default3.7.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn our 2011 response, we raised the lack of social care in the framework for Quality, Innovation, Productivity and Prevention (QIPP). The approach envisaged for Health and Wellbeing Boards – e.g. duties to encourage integrated working – could start to address this shortfall. However, this is not to underestimate the huge task in coordinating care within the NHS.
default3.8.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Royal College of Physicians’ (RCP) future hospital commission raised serious concerns about the multiple times an older person is moved while in hospital. Delayed discharge is more often caused by waits for other NHS services than for social care
default. Visits at home are well co-ordinated for people with one long-term condition (e.g. cancer or stroke) but people with ‘no specifically serious diagnosis’, many living with frailty, experience barriers to get the care they required
default.
default4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEfficiency gains within the NHS will not be realised if the crisis in social care remains unaddressed. We urgently need to recognise and act on the inter-dependency of health and social care services. Addressing the immediate funding gap in social care is essential to the short and medium term success of the ‘Nicholson Challenge’.
default4.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultNet expenditure on older people’s social care fell by £1.25 billion in real terms between 2010/11
default and 2012/13
default. In the same period, net expenditure grew for other age groups. As such, the situation has worsened since our last response.
default4.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThere continues to be evidence that eligibility for social care has further tightened. Average annual charges increased by 22.4% between 2008/2009
default and 2010/11
default. Local authorities that provide support for people with moderate needs continue to drop – 
defaultbetween 2012 and 2013, the number dropped from 26 to 10 out of 152 councils. In 2005/06, it was 40% of councils. 
default4.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWith fewer people accessing social care; flat funding against stable levels of activity
default; and productivity measured primarily against activity rather than outcomes (3.2), we are not convinced that delivering the ‘Nicholson Challenge’ is maintaining the best possible outcomes for service users.
default5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOver the long term it is clear Government needs to radically change the way in which we meet and manage the health and social care needs of a growing older population. 
default5.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe are encouraged that the Department of Health have prioritised older people in its proposed refresh for the NHS Mandate. Creating better preventative and managed care for this group of service users is the ideal start in achieving medium and long-term changes towards age- and need-appropriate health and care services.
default5.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultResearch we have published since our last response revealed the depths of the problem
default. 
defaultOver 40% of older people do not have their hypertension sufficiently treated. 80% of people over 75 with diabetes do not receive training to self-manage their condition (and the prevalence of diabetes in men in this age group has risen almost three times in the last 15 years). Almost 67% of people aged 65 to 74  are not being supported to prevent their osteoarthritis getting worse (rising to 73% for people over 75). 
default75% of people aged 65 to 74 years who had recently fallen had not had the underlying cause investigated, this despite secondary falls prevention being highly effective.
default5.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThese examples demonstrate that we still have a long way to go before older people can expect pro-active, preventative support. Such approaches should be at the core of reducing intensive support and increasing long-term wellbeing, factors which should be central in measuring performance in health and care services.
default5.4.
default&#xa0; 
defaultA dominant narrative that has emerged through the ‘Nicholson Challenge’ has been the urgent need to reduce “unnecessary admissions” to hospital, predominantly relating to older people. This has often come with the suggestion that hospitals are “very bad places for old, frail people”
default. We do not believe this is a useful way to talk about these issues. 
default5.5.
default&#xa0; 
defaultMany admissions are avoidable and an extended length of stay can have a negative effect on an older person’s health, i.e. such that their ability to self-care can be compromised. However, some admissions to hospital will always be necessary. The focus of this debate, therefore, must be on making sure community care is effective at avoiding crises and managing wellbeing while hospitals are designed and run to be safe and effective for older people when they need them. Reducing admissions must never be an end in itself.
default5.6.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe radical shift we called for in 2011 would mean retaining and enhancing the vital role of hospitals in treating older people with complex and acute needs. 
default6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo meet this long term challenge, [NHS England] should instigate a fundamental review of how the NHS assesses, prioritises and commissions services to meet the needs of an ageing population. This review should be an urgent priority for [NHS England] so that the outcome can inform the work of Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs). 
default6.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWhile we still believe that NHS England should take a detailed strategic approach to delivering care fit for an ageing society, we are also keen that there is a period of sustained stability. We welcome the recognition of “vulnerable older people” in the Government’s proposed refresh of the mandate. However, continuing annual changes to the NHS Mandate may not allow NHS England to establish new ways of working or maintain the independence it was promised at its inception.
default6.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultFuture annual changes to the NHS Mandate must be fully justified, particularly in what is expected to be an even tighter financial settlement after 2015, which will require detailed and long-term planning.
default7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEqually, Government must recognise and act on the importance of reaching a sustainable solution to the problem of funding adult social care as part of an overall programme of long-term reform.
default7.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultLocal authorities are becoming increasingly concerned that they may be unable to meet the financial obligations set out in the Care Bill. The most substantial of these obligations is likely to be new rights to support for carers, though as the impact assessment accompanying the bill points out, where this expenditure enables carers to remain economically active it will yield huge benefits to the wider economy. As family carers currently provide the bulk of care and support, any reduction in the propensity of family members to care would require a proportionately larger increase in public spending to compensate. It is important that the government has the mechanisms to properly consider these wider economic impacts when deciding on funding levels for social care. 
default7.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultOther obligations in the bill include improved information and advice for people who do not meet local authority eligibility criteria, and a national system of eligibility. Age UK strongly supports both of these measures and argues that eligibility should be set at the equivalent of ‘moderate’ under the current system rather than the more restrictive ‘substantial’. Again, there are considerable longer term economic benefits in having a more inclusive system as it would result in earlier opportunities to prevent or delay the development of more intensive care needs. A study by Deloitte
default found that funding people with moderate needs produces substantial savings for local authorities, central government and individuals
default7.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt is also important that the benefits of the proposed cap on individual care spending are not undermined by over-restrictive funding. The proposed cap is considerably higher than that proposed by the Dilnot commission and restrictive eligibility criteria will mean that people would have to spend large amounts on care before expenditure even starts to count towards the cap. These and other restrictions mean that there is a risk that implementation of the spending cap will not be perceived as fair.
