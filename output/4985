default1. Summarydefault1.1 Christian relief and development agency Tearfund welcomes this opportunity to contribute to the International Development Select Committee’s inquiry on the 
defaultUK
default’s development work in the Middle East, in particular the crisis in 
defaultSyria
default. In February 2013 Te
defaultarfund launched its own emergency appeal for Syria and thanks to the generosity of its supporters, has raised over £2 million to support partners working through local churches and community organisations in Lebanon, Jordan and Syria to reach those in need
default. Assistance includes pre-school education as well as ongoing trauma care, providing emergency food, funding for accommodation and other everyday essentials for refugees.
default&#xa0;
default1.2 The conflict in Syria has been described as the worst humanitarian disaster sinc
defaulte the end of the cold war
default.The scale of the response is hugely challenging as more than 2.2 million Syrians are hosted in the region, an estimated 84 percent of refugees living outside camps, placing unprecedented strain on communities, infrastructure and 
defaultservices in host countries of Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq and Egypt
default. The total registered refugee population in the region is expected to reach 4.1 million by December 2014
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.3 This submission by Tearfund recognises the role that the 
defaultUK
default has played by
default providing one of its largest responses to a humanitarian crisis, and recommends that:
default●
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe government continues to lobby other donors to 
defaultsecure more funding for the international responsedefault to the Syrian conflict, and should use the 2
defaultnd

defaultKuwait

default to reduce the deficit in the UN appeal funds;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Geneva II peace conference remains a priority in the 
defaultUK
default’s diplomatic efforts to 
defaultcommit urgently to reaching a negotiated settlement that will end the violencedefault, through an
default inclusive and transparent political process. 
defaultThese diplomatic talks must recognise the complexities of the conflict; the impact that not only regime but also rebel controlled areas are having on civilians, especially those from vulnerable minorities;

defaultThe 
defaultUK works with the UN Security Council and applies its weight, authority and pressure to ensure the

default●
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFollowing the high-level event in November 2013 co-chaired by DFID for international action to protect women and girls from sexual violence in emergencies, including confli
defaultcts like Syria, Tearfund recommends that the UK plays its part to fulfil 
defaultmeaningful engagement of and partnership with faith groupsdefault in the analysis, design and implementation of its programmes and service delivery for the Syria response.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default2. Challenges indefault gaining humanitarian access to affected areasdefault: default2.1 Providing assistance to the 9.3 million people in need within Syria - 40 percent of the population, and the 6.8 million who are internally displaced remains a challenge for humanitarian organisations as 
defaultthere are severe limitations of where who they can operate with. For example due to the pressing security and safety concerns of aid workers Tearfund’s partners in 
defaultSyria
default are limited to supporting about 3,000 people but this has 
defaultlargely confined to governme
defaultnt controlled areas
default. Lack of access has undermined the ability of teams to conduct evaluations and monitor impact of the response. 
defaultA humanitarian cease-fire would allow aid convoys to deliver assistance to communities which remain out of reach. 
default&#xa0;
default2.2 Parti
defaultes to the conflict have the obligation, under international humanitarian law, to facilitate the effective and safe passage of relief convoys and humanitarian personnel in areas under their control.  Yet these obligations are currently not being fulfilled, 
defaultwith many thousands of civilians cut off from food, water, medicine, and essential services as a result. Bureaucratic restrictions on assistance are being employed as a tactic in the conflict: visas are routinely denied for humanitarian personnel, registra
defaulttion for NGOs interminably delayed, and authorisation for many cross-line convoys into opposition-held areas arbitrarily withheld. All parties to the conflict have detained humanitarian convoys and prevented the safe passage of essential assistance. Failur
defaulte of the parties to respect even the most basic humanitarian principles is adding to the suffering of Syrian civilians and exacerbating political divisions.    
default&#xa0;
default2.3 During her last briefing to the UN Security Council in December 2013, Valerie Amos, UN Eme
defaultrgency Relief Coordinator, reported “modest progress” with the Syrian Government on speeding up visa issuance and increasing the number of relief distribution hubs but greater efforts are needed to ensure real gains on unhindered humanitarian access
default. Amos
default also noted that both the Government and the opposition had indicated who the interlocutors are for the UN to try to facilitate humanitarian access. However on some of the more difficult areas – protection of civilians, de-militarization of schools and hos
defaultpitals, access to besieged communities and also cross-line access to hard-to-reach areas – no progress has yet materialised.
default&#xa0;
default3. Meaningful engagement and partnership with faith communities default default3.1 By the end of 2014, it is anticipated that an additional 1.7
default million refugees will have been registered in neighbouring countries and the total registered refugee population in the region is expected to reach 4.1 million by December 2014
default. With an estimated 84 percent of refugees living outside camps, increased out
defaultreach capacity is needed to ensure all persons of concern have access to information and counselling regarding their status and available services. Tearfund’s response in 
defaultLebanon
default and 
defaultJordan
default is focussed on supporting hundreds of vulnerable Syrians who are n
defaultow living outside of formal camp settlements. The agency is working through local churches and community organisations at the heart of host communities. Some Syrians who have fled are living with host communities such as friends and relatives. However, as 
defaultspace is finite within homes this can mean up to 30 people living in one bedroom apartments. 
defaultMany others are renting accommodation in the highly inflationary private housing market, or being forced to find what shelter they can in empty and derelict buildi
defaultngs, or in informal tent settlements. Some of the least fortunate can be seen sleeping rough under bridges, in parks and on the streets
default. 
default&#xa0;
default3.2 The UNHCR evaluation report
default noted the response system was initially stretched by the need to ensure sufficient and open coordination amongst the various partners in the response. While this has substantially improved over time, more needs to be done, including through attitudinal ch
defaultange, strengthened coordination expertise and the development of links with non-traditional actors, such as faith-based organisations. Local faith communities are often crucial operational partners assisting larger agencies. Practical examples of this incl
defaultude registering asylum seekers, community peace building, conflict mitigation, promoting sustainable livelihoods, and gender and child protection
default. 
default&#xa0;
default3.3 The DEC Syria Response Review report
default also commented  that the partnerships formed by the faith-based 
defaultagencies (Islamic and Christian) appear to have a significant advantage in this respect, being able to tap into pre-existing local networks to identify and respond to needs as they arise
default. 
defaultTearfund is calling for the UNHCR and donors like the 
defaultUK
default to promote 
defaultmeaningful engagement of and partnership with
default defaultlocal civil society, including women’s rights groups, communities and faith groups, in the analysis, design and implementation of programmes and service delivery. This is particularly relevant when protecting g
defaultirls and women in emergency situations from the very start of the humanitarian response, but also applicable to other vulnerable Syrians.
default&#xa0;default4. International commitments to fund and coordinate the crisis adequatelydefault.default4.1 In mid-December 2013 the UN announced 
defaultthat it would require $6.5bn (£4bn) to fund humanitarian efforts in 
defaultSyria
default – as much as it will spend responding in the rest of the world combined. The UN’s’ sixth revised appeal for 
defaultSyria
default and the neighbouring countries is the largest UN appeal ever and ref
defaultlects the staggering scale of humanitarian needs. The task of responding to the immense demands being placed on host countries by this crisis is well beyond what can be achieved by host governments alone, or through traditional humanitarian responses. As s
defaultuch, the swift and substantial involvement of development actors and the commitment of significant additional financing to stabilise the situation are urgently required.
default&#xa0;
default4.2 The UN estimates nearly three-quarters of 
defaultSyria
default's 22.4 million population will ne
defaulted humanitarian aid in 2014. In total, the UN is asking for almost $13bn (£7.9bn) to fund its humanitarian operations. Some $2.3bn (£1.4m) are destined for civilians inside 
defaultSyria
default, while $4.2bn (£2.6m) would go to Syrian refugees in neighbouring countries. 
defaultThe latest call exceeds the UN's record appeal for $4.4bn (£2.7bn) in June, of which only 60 percent has been funded so far.
default&#xa0;
default4.3 Donor governments – in the region and the OECD – must urgently give more aid now, and be ready to give more in the longer term
default as, tragically, the needs increase. Despite global financial challenges the international community must continue to rally to the aid of the Syrian people, as well as the neighbouring countries which through their generosity and solidarity are bearing an 
defaultimmense burden.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.4 Tearfund welcomes the efforts of the UK to improve the overall leadership and coordination of the humanitarian response, for example when the Secretary of State for International Development initiated a working group of top donors an
defaultd humanitarian partners to agree and monitor implementation of practical steps to improve the effectiveness of the international aid operation in Syria and the region. The working group’s meetings last year were a much needed step in the right direction, a
defaultnd Tearfund hopes that a meeting for 2014 will continue to drive forward progress and strengthen coordination.
default&#xa0;
default5. Political resolution to end the conflictdefault.default5.1 In conclusion, with an unprecedented crisis such as 
defaultSyria
default it is critical that a long term polit
defaultical resolution is reached. Countries that are strapped in cycles of conflict and fragility are less likely to thrive and develop, and when there political dialogue fails the humanitarian efforts are hampered. 
default&#xa0;
default5.2 The 
defaultUK
default needs to commit urgently to reach
defaulting a negotiated settlement that will end the violence, through an inclusive and transparent political process. Without a clear, coherent or robust 
defaultplan for
default peaceful resolution, the international community must prioritise the Geneva II talks to 
defaultkick-start
default 
defaultsuch a process. 
defaultThese diplomatic talks must recognise the complexities of the conflict; the impact that not only regime but also rebel controlled areas are having on civilians, especially those from vulnerable minorities. 
defaultThe 
defaultUK
default should use its diplomatic m
defaultuscle to bring different parties together to discuss, agree and implement an inclusive and transparent political process.
