defaultExecutive summary
defaultThis memorandum addresses 
defaultthe qu
defaultestion of why women are less represented than men at the top of the 
defaultcareer ladder
default in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) areas
default, and what universities and the government might seek to do about this.
default 
defaultThe conclusion is that many women don’t continue STEM careers because they opt for other life choices. Therefore, unive
defaultrsities and the government would be misguided to give preferential treatment to women in fields they have chosen not to develop careers in.

defaultAbout the author
defaultI am a research co-ordinator working for University College London 
default(UCL) 
defaultin the Institute for 
defaultWomen’s Health. My work entails initiating and support research projects in the field of women’s health, mainly in the area of polycystic ovary syndrome. I am a chartered psychologist, and my 
defaultMSc and 
defaultPhD 
defaultdissertations were on 
defaultthe 
defaultsubject of the 
defaultpsychologic
defaultal 
defaultdimensions
default of polycystic ovary syndrome. 
defaultI also tutor in research methods and statistics. 
default3/default 
defaultMy interest in positive action for women in STEM began shortly after I began my current position with UCL in Sept 2011. Having been a mature student, I was 
defaultkeen to ensure that my career had every chance of progressing in a timely fashion. I was therefore very interested to receive an email from UCL regarding career-enhancing opportunities being made available
default through a scheme called Athena Swan
default. However when 
defaultI responded to the email I was told that I could not participate, because the scheme was for women o
defaultnly
default. 
defaultThus began my interest in the topic of the promotion of women in STEM.

defaultWhy do numbers of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder?
default&#xa0;
defaultAbout a year ago the Universi
defaultty and College Union circulated a
default document called ‘The Chemistry PhD: the impact on women’s retention’ (RSC, 2008). It supp
defaultosedly demonstrated how women a
defaultre held back from careers in chemistry, and was given as an example of how women were held back in STEM careers in general. I read the 
defaultdocument and was surprised that anyone could come to any other conclusion than that the women in the study didn’t want a career in chemi
defaultstry because 
defaultit simply wasn’t the kind of career they wanted to get into. The author of the study concluded that female 
defaultPhD students more than male had 
default“
defaultformed the impression 
defaultthe doctoral research process is an ordeal filled with frustration, pressure and
default 
defaultstress, which a career in research would only prolong”
default (
defaultRSC 2008, p.7).
default 
defaultThe main reasons seemed to revolve around the th
defaulteme that a career in chemistry was solitary, entailed long hours, stress, a competitive (“macho”) culture and was not conducive “with other aspects of their life, particularly relationships and family” (
defaultRSC 2008, p.7).
default 
defaultOther rese
defaultarch has found similar opin
defaultions
default amongst
default women 
defaultregarding STEM careers 
default(e.g. 
defaultO’Driscoll
default and Anderson, 1994), yet these papers are presented as evidence that it is some kind of gender-based discriminated that holds these women back. 
defaultRather than supporting women’s choices, there are tho
defaultse in acade
defaultmia who appear oblivious
default to women’s choices.
default&#xa0;
default6/ 
defaultQ: 
defaultWhat role should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers? 
defaultIn government too there is concern that women’s life choices are holding them back in the workplace. For example, 
defaultMP Lynn Featherstone’s says: “I think that it [having a baby] is a bit of a setback to women because it gives an opportunity – whether it’s in
default commerce, politics or wherever you work – to men to climb the ladder faster. There is a period of a woman’s life – where she may need to take a break or work at a different rate. I have seen many mediocre men on the boards of directors…they get there beca
defaultuse they had no [career] break along the way. And some get to the top because of who they knew.” 
default(The Telegraph, 2012). Again, the focus appears to be on promoting women in the workplace rather than respecting women’s rights to a family life. 
defaultAlthough the 
defaultevidence for women being disadvantaged in regards STEM opportunities is limited, the evidence that children are disadvantaged by being left 
defaultin inadequate
default 
defaultdaycare
default is much clearer (Todd et al, 2001)
default&#xa0;
default7
default/ 
defaultQ: 
defaultWhat should universities and the higher education 
defaultsector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice?
defaultOne solution that has been widely adopted 
defaultin universities in the UK 
defaultis the 
defaultAthena Swann Charter. This is scheme that aims to promote women in STE
defaultM fields through a wide variety 
defaultof programmes e.g. training 
defaultthose in 
defaultmanagement to be aware of their own ‘unconscious bias’ in 
defaultthe 
defaulthiring and promotion of women, special mentoring schemes for women, and access to career networks for women. The aim appears 
defaultto be to have as many women 
defaultas men 
defaultin the top jobs in STEM, and anything short of this 
defaultis an unacceptable gender inequality
default.
default T
defaulthe first principal of the Athena Swan
default charter is to “To address gender inequalities requires commitment and action from everyone, 
defaultat all levels of the organisation” (Athena Swan Charter, 2012). In my opinion, the use of the term ‘gender inequalities’ is misused here because it carries with it connotations of sex discrimination; this is misplaced in a situation where the ‘inequality’ 
defaultis based on women’s choice not to develop careers in a given field
default.

defaultShould universities adopt the Athena Swann charter?

defaultYellowlees
default the firs
defaultt female president 
defaultof the 
defaultRoyal Society of Chemistry (RSC). 
defaultShe is
default a supporter of the Athena Swan Charter, 
defaultand 
defaultsaid in an interview: “I’m not an advocate of po
defaultsitive discrimination…
default. “I want women to feel like they achieved what they
default’ve achieved on their o
defaultwn merit
default” (ACS, 2013)
default.
default 
defaultThis raises the question of how the ‘leaky pipeline’ is repaired without resorting to positive discrimination. 
default9/ 
defaultAlthough positive discrimination in the workplace is illegal in the UK, ‘positive action’ is perfectly legal. What is 
defaultthe difference between the two? 
defaultThe latter is 
defaultdeemed acceptable based
default on the proportionate principle: how serious the inequality is and how important the need is. 
defaultHowever, proportionate action
default depends on the perception of the employer, which in turn depend
defaults on the evidence available to the employer. My concerns are that (1) many employers will make poor decisions about employment pr
defaultactices based on weak evidence, such as the RSC
default 
default(2008) 
defaultpaper cited above, or based upon 
default“
defaultdiscussion with employees or their rep
defaultresentatives
default”
default, 
defaultrather than sound evidence, 
defaultas suggested in 
defaultthe government’s 
defaultEquality Action note (Jarrett 2011, p.8
default), and (2) this will create a 
defaultbarrier to men to progress in the STEM workplace. 
defaultUnlike 
defaultLyn
defaultn Featherstone, I do not presume that many of the m
defaulten in top jobs are
default ‘mediocre’
default, but 
defaultpeople who have worked hard and 
defaultwho should not be systematically disadvantaged because of their sex. 
default 
default10/ 
defaultThere are cases where there is a reasonable argument for that women having priority over men in filling certain 
defaultjobs. This might be seen around issues of religion (e.g. where a woman prefers not to be seen by a male doctor) or sensitivity (e.g. personal care of elderly women). The same reasoning applies to corresponding jobs for men. However there is no reasonable a
defaultrgument for giving women preferential access to jobs or career development opportunities in cases where a man might just as easily do the job. The reality of the job market is
default that it is a zero-sum game:
default giving advantage to one pe
defaultrson is to disadvantage an
defaultother, and does not lead to equality.
