[normal]Executive summary
[normal]This memorandum addresses 
[normal]the qu
[normal]estion of why women are less represented than men at the top of the 
[normal]career ladder
[normal] in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) areas
[normal], and what universities and the government might seek to do about this.
[normal] 
[normal]The conclusion is that many women don’t continue STEM careers because they opt for other life choices. Therefore, unive
[normal]rsities and the government would be misguided to give preferential treatment to women in fields they have chosen not to develop careers in.

[normal]About the author
[normal]I am a research co-ordinator working for University College London 
[normal](UCL) 
[normal]in the Institute for 
[normal]Women’s Health. My work entails initiating and support research projects in the field of women’s health, mainly in the area of polycystic ovary syndrome. I am a chartered psychologist, and my 
[normal]MSc and 
[normal]PhD 
[normal]dissertations were on 
[normal]the 
[normal]subject of the 
[normal]psychologic
[normal]al 
[normal]dimensions
[normal] of polycystic ovary syndrome. 
[normal]I also tutor in research methods and statistics. 
[normal]3/[bold] 
[normal]My interest in positive action for women in STEM began shortly after I began my current position with UCL in Sept 2011. Having been a mature student, I was 
[normal]keen to ensure that my career had every chance of progressing in a timely fashion. I was therefore very interested to receive an email from UCL regarding career-enhancing opportunities being made available
[normal] through a scheme called Athena Swan
[normal]. However when 
[normal]I responded to the email I was told that I could not participate, because the scheme was for women o
[normal]nly
[normal]. 
[normal]Thus began my interest in the topic of the promotion of women in STEM.

[normal]5/ [bold]F[bold]actual information [bold]that the [bold]co[bold]mmittee should be aware of[bold]Q: 
[normal]Why do numbers of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]About a year ago the Universi
[normal]ty and College Union circulated a
[normal] document called ‘The Chemistry PhD: the impact on women’s retention’ (RSC, 2008). It supp
[normal]osedly demonstrated how women a
[normal]re held back from careers in chemistry, and was given as an example of how women were held back in STEM careers in general. I read the 
[normal]document and was surprised that anyone could come to any other conclusion than that the women in the study didn’t want a career in chemi
[normal]stry because 
[normal]it simply wasn’t the kind of career they wanted to get into. The author of the study concluded that female 
[normal]PhD students more than male had 
[normal]“
[normal]formed the impression 
[normal]the doctoral research process is an ordeal filled with frustration, pressure and
[normal] 
[normal]stress, which a career in research would only prolong”
[normal] (
[normal]RSC 2008, p.7).
[normal] 
[normal]The main reasons seemed to revolve around the th
[normal]eme that a career in chemistry was solitary, entailed long hours, stress, a competitive (“macho”) culture and was not conducive “with other aspects of their life, particularly relationships and family” (
[normal]RSC 2008, p.7).
[normal] 
[normal]Other rese
[normal]arch has found similar opin
[normal]ions
[normal] amongst
[normal] women 
[normal]regarding STEM careers 
[normal](e.g. 
[normal]O’Driscoll
[normal] and Anderson, 1994), yet these papers are presented as evidence that it is some kind of gender-based discriminated that holds these women back. 
[normal]Rather than supporting women’s choices, there are tho
[normal]se in acade
[normal]mia who appear oblivious
[normal] to women’s choices.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6/ 
[normal]Q: 
[normal]What role should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers? 
[normal]In government too there is concern that women’s life choices are holding them back in the workplace. For example, 
[normal]MP Lynn Featherstone’s says: “I think that it [having a baby] is a bit of a setback to women because it gives an opportunity – whether it’s in
[normal] commerce, politics or wherever you work – to men to climb the ladder faster. There is a period of a woman’s life – where she may need to take a break or work at a different rate. I have seen many mediocre men on the boards of directors…they get there beca
[normal]use they had no [career] break along the way. And some get to the top because of who they knew.” 
[normal](The Telegraph, 2012). Again, the focus appears to be on promoting women in the workplace rather than respecting women’s rights to a family life. 
[normal]Although the 
[normal]evidence for women being disadvantaged in regards STEM opportunities is limited, the evidence that children are disadvantaged by being left 
[normal]in inadequate
[normal] 
[normal]daycare
[normal] is much clearer (Todd et al, 2001)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7
[normal]/ 
[normal]Q: 
[normal]What should universities and the higher education 
[normal]sector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice?
[normal]One solution that has been widely adopted 
[normal]in universities in the UK 
[normal]is the 
[normal]Athena Swann Charter. This is scheme that aims to promote women in STE
[normal]M fields through a wide variety 
[normal]of programmes e.g. training 
[normal]those in 
[normal]management to be aware of their own ‘unconscious bias’ in 
[normal]the 
[normal]hiring and promotion of women, special mentoring schemes for women, and access to career networks for women. The aim appears 
[normal]to be to have as many women 
[normal]as men 
[normal]in the top jobs in STEM, and anything short of this 
[normal]is an unacceptable gender inequality
[normal].
[normal] T
[normal]he first principal of the Athena Swan
[normal] charter is to “To address gender inequalities requires commitment and action from everyone, 
[normal]at all levels of the organisation” (Athena Swan Charter, 2012). In my opinion, the use of the term ‘gender inequalities’ is misused here because it carries with it connotations of sex discrimination; this is misplaced in a situation where the ‘inequality’ 
[normal]is based on women’s choice not to develop careers in a given field
[normal].
[normal]8/ 
[normal]Should universities adopt the Athena Swann charter? 
[normal]Lesley 
[normal]Yellowlees
[normal] the firs
[normal]t female president 
[normal]of the 
[normal]Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC). 
[normal]She is
[normal] a supporter of the Athena Swan Charter, 
[normal]and 
[normal]said in an interview: “I’m not an advocate of po
[normal]sitive discrimination…
[normal]. “I want women to feel like they achieved what they
[normal]’ve achieved on their o
[normal]wn merit
[normal]” (ACS, 2013)
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]This raises the question of how the ‘leaky pipeline’ is repaired without resorting to positive discrimination. 
[normal]9/ 
[normal]Although positive discrimination in the workplace is illegal in the UK, ‘positive action’ is perfectly legal. What is 
[normal]the difference between the two? 
[normal]The latter is 
[normal]deemed acceptable based
[normal] on the proportionate principle: how serious the inequality is and how important the need is. 
[normal]However, proportionate action
[normal] depends on the perception of the employer, which in turn depend
[normal]s on the evidence available to the employer. My concerns are that (1) many employers will make poor decisions about employment pr
[normal]actices based on weak evidence, such as the RSC
[normal] 
[normal](2008) 
[normal]paper cited above, or based upon 
[normal]“
[normal]discussion with employees or their rep
[normal]resentatives
[normal]”
[normal], 
[normal]rather than sound evidence, 
[normal]as suggested in 
[normal]the government’s 
[normal]Equality Action note (Jarrett 2011, p.8
[normal]), and (2) this will create a 
[normal]barrier to men to progress in the STEM workplace. 
[normal]Unlike 
[normal]Lyn
[normal]n Featherstone, I do not presume that many of the m
[normal]en in top jobs are
[normal] ‘mediocre’
[normal], but 
[normal]people who have worked hard and 
[normal]who should not be systematically disadvantaged because of their sex. 
[normal] 
[normal]10/ 
[normal]There are cases where there is a reasonable argument for that women having priority over men in filling certain 
[normal]jobs. This might be seen around issues of religion (e.g. where a woman prefers not to be seen by a male doctor) or sensitivity (e.g. personal care of elderly women). The same reasoning applies to corresponding jobs for men. However there is no reasonable a
[normal]rgument for giving women preferential access to jobs or career development opportunities in cases where a man might just as easily do the job. The reality of the job market is
[normal] that it is a zero-sum game:
[normal] giving advantage to one pe
[normal]rson is to disadvantage an
[normal]other, and does not lead to equality.
