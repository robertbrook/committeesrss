"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Graeme Thompson [FBB0051]&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFrom Graeme Thompson, Trustee of the Royal Television Society and Dean of Arts, Design and Media\n,\n University of Sunderland\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe North East of England \ndeveloped a substantial TV and production sector between the late 1960s and late 1990s as a result of significant investment in local production by ITV Tyne Tees and BBC North East. \n&#xa0;\nSadly \njobs and commissions started to dry up in the early part of the ne\nw century as ITV pulled out of its studio complex in Newcastle and focused production on London. Ofcom meanwhile agreed with ITV that it could pull out of its \nregional programme production licence commitment. Jobs were lost and many media professionals wer\ne forced to move to London to find work. The BBC \nmaintained its commitment to regional production with current affairs/documentary productions Inside Out and The Politics Show. \n&#xa0;\n200\n6\n was a lowpoint for the region with the BBC’s decision to \nend its long ru\nnning childrens\n drama Byker Grove – which had been \na successful training ground for performers and production talent such as Ant &amp; Dec, Jill Halfpenny and Oscar winning director Tom Hooper. In the same year\n,\n ITV dropped \nits own long running North East-\nbase\nd drama Wire in the Blood.\n&#xa0;\nIt is to th\ne credit of the BBC, that executives\n recognized the significance of the gap left by \nByker Grove. Another childrens’\n show was swiftly \nparachuted into the region\n.\n The Revenge Files of Alistair \nFury ran for just one seri\nes and offered work to production staff who had \nbeen \npreviously \nemployed on \nByker Grove.\n&#xa0;\nThe new team at BBC North\n in Salford\n – liaising with the local Royal Television Society and Northern Film and Media – decided \nto \ntap in to\n the region’s expertise in c\nhildrens’ pro\nduction by moving Tracy Beaker R\neturns to Newcastle.  The decision was then taken to shift production of the \n‘\n60s detective drama Inspector George Gently from Ireland to Durham.\n&#xa0;\nCBBC quickly built on that momentum \nand brought new childrens’ d\nramas Wolfblood and The Dumping Ground to the North East. They join the BBC1 period shopping drama The Paradise \n(filmed near Sunderland) \nand ITV police \nseries Vera (filmed in Northumberland). The BBC invested more than £1m in creating sets at Lambton Castl\ne for The Paradise. \n&#xa0;\nNorthern Film and Media estimate these new television productions \ncurrently \ncontribute more than £6m to the production economy of the region\n - £12,700 a day in salaries, accommodation and equipment hire.\n&#xa0;\nDirector of BBC North Peter Salmon said he believed the success of the BBC move to Salford would be judged not on its impact around the North West, but on its ability to engage\n audiences and revive and develop programme teams in Yorkshire and the North Eas\nt.\nThe current level of \ntelevision \npro\nduction \nin the North East proves \nthe BBC is taking that strategy seriously. The corporation is also investing in developing new writers and new producers with projects including Jesting About \n- \nwhich aims to uncover co\nmedy talent. One of the successes of that project is North East writer-performer Jason Cook whose BBC2 comedy Hebburn is into i\nts second series. \nExecutives at BBC North are currently\n in discussions with Northern Film and Media and other partners about brin\nging further projects to the region.\n&#xa0;\nWithout the BBC, the North East television production sector would now be a shadow of its former self. It is the view of myself and many others in the region, that the BBC used its influence and resources to positively\n make a difference to a \nproduction sector and programme-making tradition which had found itself facing terminal decline. \n&#xa0;\nSeven years ago, \nLondon-based \nITV, Channel 4, Five and Sky were unable to \noffer the North East production se\nctor a lifeline. The BBC \nhowever recognized the value of making use of experienced production teams and location managers. And further realized the positive impact on audiences of making television from this region of England.\n&#xa0;\nThis seems sensible and strategic \nuse of the\n licence \nfee \n- which \nof course \nis \npartly made up of contributions from the two million people resident in households around North East England.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
