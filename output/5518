[normal]Executive Summary[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1. [bold]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Relational Research is just beginning a three year project seeking to understand 
[normal]school academic 
[normal]success
[normal] by focusing on 
[normal]stakeholder relationships
[normal]. 
[normal]Schools involve a wide 
[normal]range of internal and external stakeholders and there is a matrix of relationships in any school (and from school to school): these include students, teachers, support staff, educational specialists, administrators, governors, parents, local communities, f
[normal]aith communities (in some instances), local and central government and society at large.
[normal] 
[normal]Relational Research
[normal] and Relationships Foundation 
[normal]endeavour
[normal] 
[normal]to influence public policy and organisational pr
[normal]actice with a relational agenda
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The aim is to build ‘relati
[normal]onal capital’ in the lives of families and communities through the way organisations and structures are
[normal] 
[normal]arranged
[normal], and through the
[normal] goals they set for themselves.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]We want 
[normal]to understand the means by which relational practice can be fostered in schools. 
[normal]We wish to 
[normal]determine ways in which schools and students can be assessed for their relational understanding and competence.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]We are interested in the ways in which the interconnection of key stakeholders intersect at critical stages in a student’s school ca
[normal]reer, establishing ways of evaluating how such impact is manifested, with a view to transferring emergent understanding to other students, and to thus support successful outcomes.
[normal] We provide practical help to schools to intervene and encourage greater prox
[normal]imity between the key stakeholders in education and thus improve student outcomes. We have worked 
[normal]successfully i
[normal]n 
[normal]various
[normal] 
[normal]public service settings such as primary health care and 
[normal]prisons
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Chief Inspector of Ofsted, Sir Michael Wilshaw, makes several recommendations in response to issues and concerns raised in the Annual Report relating 
[normal]to the performance of schools; w
[normal]e would like to highlight a neglected element. 
[normal]In a recent session 
[normal]of 
[normal]th
[normal]e 
[normal]committee
[normal] the chair, Graham Stuart MP, highlighted this fundamental neglected element with Sir Michael Wi
[normal]l
[normal]shaw asking specific questions on the subject of “
[normal]quality relationships
[normal]” which in his words need addressing. He stated, “
[normal]Every time we look at chi
[normal]ldren struggling in this country, it’s the quality of relationships with adults which comes back again and again as the thing they’re craving. What is there around organisations and fermenting and supporting these organisations which could lead to the comm
[normal]unity coming back again?
[normal]” Mr Stuart’s 
[normal]interest
[normal] is one we share: wishing for people to be good citizens it is not enough; 
[normal]“
[normal]we are going to have to find some kind of policy approach to facilitate more high quality relationships between adults and children
[normal].”
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2. [bold]Strengthening relationships in the home and school[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The most critical need 
[normal]is the problems
[normal] created by poor or dysfunctional relationships which leads to low levels of motivation and achievement of pupils in schools, and conflict and/or loneliness among communities, families and individuals across society (which we refer to as ‘relational povert
[normal]y’). The correlation between relational breakdown in the home and poor educational outcomes is well documented. Parents from such backgrounds are often
[normal], 
[normal]but not exclusively
[normal],
[normal] in housing and community contexts which make it hard for positive relationships to
[normal] be sustained
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]E
[normal]vidence from Feinstein and Symons suggests that parental involvement with education 
[normal](which is defined here as the amount of time and quality of an interaction with a child rather than traditional measures of engagement such as attendance a
[normal]t parent/consultation evenings or participation in committees) is
[normal] the, ‘
[normal]single greatest predictor of achievement
[normal]’
[normal]; 
[normal]and most importantly
[normal],
[normal] factors such as the educational experience of a parent or the socio-economic context of the home 
[normal]can be
[normal] counterbalanced by strong productive relationships. True parental engagement is 
[normal](perhaps) 
[normal]not with the school but with the child. Supporting and intervening in this relationship is considered vital.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Evidence from those like Bergin and Bergin 
[normal](2009) 
[normal]demon
[normal]strate that students
[normal] who develop positive relationships with teachers 
[normal]achieve stronger academic outcomes.
[normal] Where strong relationships are fostered between teachers and students, evidence suggests that poor or dysfunctional relationships in the home can be p
[normal]artially compensated for
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Conversely, r
[normal]esearch by the Centre for Social Justice 
[normal](2000) 
[normal]suggests that over two-thirds of all those who truanted did so in order to avoid a particular lesson, with ‘
[normal]relationship with the teacher
[normal]’ cited as one of the principal
[normal] grounds for relational breakdown.
[normal] Where relationships are strong in the classroom, they can 
[normal]surmount 
[normal]social inequality; where they are poor or dysfunctional, evidence suggests they reinforce educational disadvantage.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Positive peer to peer relationships a
[normal]lso impact on student’s academic and non-academic functioning in secondary education. Positive peer interaction correlates well with 
[normal]student
[normal] motivation (Furrer and Skinner, 2003), 
[normal]student
[normal] engagement (Keefe and Berndt, 1996) and academic 
[normal]outcomes
[normal] (Keefe and
[normal] Berndt, 1995).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. [bold]Policy [bold]Recommendations[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]Schools should be supported to provide more robust assessment of the relationships that sustain their performance.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]              
[normal]Ofsted should review the extent to which schools are able to effectively evaluate 
[normal]relationships and identify means of improving them.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]              
[normal]Given the importance of relationships for the provision of schooling (and other policy outcomes) the Department for Education should report on the extent to which it sees relationships as a limiting 
[normal]factor in school improvement and how such relationships might be improved.
