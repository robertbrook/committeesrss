default&#xa0;
default1. defaultIntroductiondefault&#xa0;
default1.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultRelational Research is just beginning a three year project seeking to understand 
defaultschool academic 
defaultsuccess
default by focusing on 
defaultstakeholder relationships
default. 
defaultSchools involve a wide 
defaultrange of internal and external stakeholders and there is a matrix of relationships in any school (and from school to school): these include students, teachers, support staff, educational specialists, administrators, governors, parents, local communities, f
defaultaith communities (in some instances), local and central government and society at large.
default 
defaultRelational Research
default and Relationships Foundation 
defaultendeavour
default 
defaultto influence public policy and organisational pr
defaultactice with a relational agenda
default.
default 
defaultThe aim is to build ‘relati
defaultonal capital’ in the lives of families and communities through the way organisations and structures are
default 
defaultarranged
default, and through the
default goals they set for themselves.
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe want 
defaultto understand the means by which relational practice can be fostered in schools. 
defaultWe wish to 
defaultdetermine ways in which schools and students can be assessed for their relational understanding and competence.
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe are interested in the ways in which the interconnection of key stakeholders intersect at critical stages in a student’s school ca
defaultreer, establishing ways of evaluating how such impact is manifested, with a view to transferring emergent understanding to other students, and to thus support successful outcomes.
default We provide practical help to schools to intervene and encourage greater prox
defaultimity between the key stakeholders in education and thus improve student outcomes. We have worked 
defaultsuccessfully i
defaultn 
defaultvarious
default 
defaultpublic service settings such as primary health care and 
defaultprisons
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chief Inspector of Ofsted, Sir Michael Wilshaw, makes several recommendations in response to issues and concerns raised in the Annual Report relating 
defaultto the performance of schools; w
defaulte would like to highlight a neglected element. 
defaultIn a recent session 
defaultof 
defaultth
defaulte 
defaultcommittee
default the chair, Graham Stuart MP, highlighted this fundamental neglected element with Sir Michael Wi
defaultl
defaultshaw asking specific questions on the subject of “
defaultquality relationships
default” which in his words need addressing. He stated, “
defaultEvery time we look at chi
defaultldren struggling in this country, it’s the quality of relationships with adults which comes back again and again as the thing they’re craving. What is there around organisations and fermenting and supporting these organisations which could lead to the comm
defaultunity coming back again?
default” Mr Stuart’s 
defaultinterest
default is one we share: wishing for people to be good citizens it is not enough; 
default“
defaultwe are going to have to find some kind of policy approach to facilitate more high quality relationships between adults and children
default.”
default&#xa0;default2. defaultStrengthening relationships in the home and schooldefault&#xa0;
default2.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe most critical need 
defaultis the problems
default created by poor or dysfunctional relationships which leads to low levels of motivation and achievement of pupils in schools, and conflict and/or loneliness among communities, families and individuals across society (which we refer to as ‘relational povert
defaulty’). The correlation between relational breakdown in the home and poor educational outcomes is well documented. Parents from such backgrounds are often
default, 
defaultbut not exclusively
default,
default in housing and community contexts which make it hard for positive relationships to
default be sustained
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultE
defaultvidence from Feinstein and Symons suggests that parental involvement with education 
default(which is defined here as the amount of time and quality of an interaction with a child rather than traditional measures of engagement such as attendance a
defaultt parent/consultation evenings or participation in committees) is
default the, ‘
defaultsingle greatest predictor of achievement
default’
default; 
defaultand most importantly
default,
default factors such as the educational experience of a parent or the socio-economic context of the home 
defaultcan be
default counterbalanced by strong productive relationships. True parental engagement is 
default(perhaps) 
defaultnot with the school but with the child. Supporting and intervening in this relationship is considered vital.
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultEvidence from those like Bergin and Bergin 
default(2009) 
defaultdemon
defaultstrate that students
default who develop positive relationships with teachers 
defaultachieve stronger academic outcomes.
default Where strong relationships are fostered between teachers and students, evidence suggests that poor or dysfunctional relationships in the home can be p
defaultartially compensated for
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultConversely, r
defaultesearch by the Centre for Social Justice 
default(2000) 
defaultsuggests that over two-thirds of all those who truanted did so in order to avoid a particular lesson, with ‘
defaultrelationship with the teacher
default’ cited as one of the principal
default grounds for relational breakdown.
default Where relationships are strong in the classroom, they can 
defaultsurmount 
defaultsocial inequality; where they are poor or dysfunctional, evidence suggests they reinforce educational disadvantage.
default&#xa0;
default2.5
default&#xa0; 
defaultPositive peer to peer relationships a
defaultlso impact on student’s academic and non-academic functioning in secondary education. Positive peer interaction correlates well with 
defaultstudent
default motivation (Furrer and Skinner, 2003), 
defaultstudent
default engagement (Keefe and Berndt, 1996) and academic 
defaultoutcomes
default (Keefe and
default Berndt, 1995).
default&#xa0;
default3. defaultPolicy defaultRecommendationsdefault&#xa0;
default3.1
default              
defaultSchools should be supported to provide more robust assessment of the relationships that sustain their performance.
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default              
defaultOfsted should review the extent to which schools are able to effectively evaluate 
defaultrelationships and identify means of improving them.
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default              
defaultGiven the importance of relationships for the provision of schooling (and other policy outcomes) the Department for Education should report on the extent to which it sees relationships as a limiting 
defaultfactor in school improvement and how such relationships might be improved.
