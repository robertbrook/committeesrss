[[[Executive Summary]]]For several years we have voiced our concern about the UK food trade deficit. Has the Treasury noticed this ever-increasing gap – now £19.5bn, up £5bn since 5 years ago? Should this fact not be a potent warning and a wake-up call?Our reliance on sea traffic is becoming gradually greater; however, no-one can deny the weakening of the Royal Navy. We also rely on certain geo-political factors that do not change – trade, distance, and choke points that the UK depends on. There is a large range and shifting complex of risks and threats to our national security, but one thing is clear, that to increase UK food production is essential and vital to our future safety as well as to our social and economic well-being. David Heath’s article in the national press ‘Dig for Survival’ was starkly relevant in our present position.Our thoughts are tersely summed up in the words of George Washington: ‘I know of no pursuit in which more real and important services can be rendered to any country than by improving its agriculture’.December 2013 &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
