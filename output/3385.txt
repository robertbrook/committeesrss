[[[ (WSC0098)]]]Women are consistently under-represented in STEM, particularly in the higher levels of academia where the proportion of women at professor level is astonishingly low. One of the most significant issues is the so-called “leaky pipeline” whereby women eagerly begin a career in research, only to leave academia in large numbers as their career progresses. In the biosciences in 2011/12, 41.9% of researchers are female, but this figure drops to just 16.4% of professors. The situation is also bleak across other fields, as shown in Figure 1. The launch of the UKRC in 2004 was a very welcome development, showing a clear commitment by the Government to studying the barriers that women face in science and supporting them over such hurdles, however in 2010 funding for the UKRC was abolished - a great blow for gender equality in STEM. The UKRC has now become WISE (Women into Science and Engineering), and is a community interest company. However the Government has allocated around 8% of the funding formerly available for the UKRC to the Royal Academy of Engineering (RAEng) to support their diversity work, in particular the provision of a new diversity programme that is a joint collaboration between the RAEng and the Royal Society.  They produced a progress report entitled ‘Leading the Way’ in March 2013.Many aspects of academic life have been highlighted as fuelling the leaky pipeline, including a “macho” working culture, inadequate supervision and the expectation of unusually long working hours, as demonstrated by a 2008 report by the RSC and UKRC. In addition a lack of consideration for those with family commitments may lead to poor scheduling of meetings that has a negative impact on both men and women juggling research careers with other pressures. The greater provision for, and much greater publicity of, more flexible working patterns should be promoted: 43% of working women and 13% men are employed part-time nationwide, however in academia, 28.5% of men work part time compared to 43% of women, indicating that a move to promote flexible working would be beneficial to all.Encouraging women to pursue a career in STEM begins with a strong scientific basis in primary education and develops through the promotion of STEM GCSE and A levels to older school students. This has proved more successful in some subjects than others; while women make up nearly 42% of STEM A level entrants overall, only 21% of physics A levels were entered by women - a percentage that has remained almost constant since the year 2000. At university, 2011/12 figures show that women take 50.7% of all STEM HE qualifications at all levels, although in engineering and technology the proportion of women was only 14.3% (Figure2). STEM subjects were found to account for 35.2% of the HE qualifications achieved by women in 2010/11, which is a decrease on 2006 when they accounted for 37% of subjects, and brings the value nearer to the 2003 figure of 34.8%.  As discussed above women do not continue to be represented at such high levels further up the academic hierarchy. Neither, it would appear, do women seek employment in STEM related careers: only 13% of those in STEM occupations are women.While cultural problems within STEM careers, whether in academia or other occupations, may account for the loss of some women to non-STEM careers, the lack of adequate careers advice may also be a contributing factor. Many researchers are dependant on their supervisors for advice regarding career choices and may well be unaware of flexible working, childcare provision and support networks available.Women are also under-represented across other indicators of achievement, including fellowship of the Royal Society where only 5% of fellows are women. While it is claimed that 10% of new fellows elected have been women, this proportion is not truly representative of the gender breakdown of the pool of eligible academics, since the criteria does not included the need for the nominee to be a Professor. In addition since the election process operates by nomination from existing Fellows, rather than by application, the low numbers of women elected cannot be a product of the self-confidence issues that have often been put forward to explain the disproportionately low numbers of women achieving board positions, prizes and other accolades.,While there have been many studies into discrimination in scientific fields, several of which refute that there is sexism in peer-review, hiring or grant applications, a recent PNAS paper revealed that both men and women view female applicants, with identical qualifications to male applicants, as being less capable and deserving a lower salary. The paper highlights the need for a gender-blind shortlisting of applicants, but also coaching within academia to raise awareness of what may well be an unconscious bias against women. Double-blind peer review for publications and grant applications may be necessary to help to minimise discrimination, although the process of peer review itself makes true “blind” review difficult to attain.Schemes such as those run by the Daphne Jackson Trust, the Wellcome Trust and L’Oreal all support researchers who wish to return to science after a career break,,. However CaSE believes greater work needs to be done to increase the scope of these schemes and raise awareness of them. While women are significantly more likely to take a career break than men, support may also be required by both genders for a variety of reasons, from ill-health to caring for sick relatives. CaSE believes a change in culture is required within academia to remove any stigma surrounding flexible working and to ensure that those working part time or returning from a career break are adequately supported and in no way penalised for their choices. With the loss of funding for the UKRC, CaSE calls for government to commit financial backing and other support to alternative schemes designed to promote gender equality across the STEM sector.  For example, UKRC used to provide a searchable resource of detailed annual statistics on gender in STEM at all stages of careers.  With limited resource, WISE now produce a statistics digest which is not as comprehensive.  A modest amount of government funding could reinstate this valuable resource to full detail, providing the only comprehensive resource for quantitative analysis across the sector.  We know that measurement alone is often an effective stimulus for action so CaSE predicts that a reinstated comprehensive data collection service would not only provide a data resource but would also lead to improved outcomes.CaSE, and others have written extensively about the need to increase the diversity of the pool of students studying STEM subjects and working in STEM careers.  One of the most common causes of exasperation is that what is needed is not more recommendations, but more action.  In 2011 Professor Dame Sally Davies, Chief Medical Officer, linked funding of biomedical research centres and units to the attainment of a silver Athena SWAN award.  This requirement has resulted in a huge increase in submissions to the Athena Swan charter over the last year.,  In 2013 David Willetts, Minister for Universities and Science, followed suit by linking capital funding for university teaching resources in STEM to demonstration of a commitment to diversity, such as an Athena SWAN award.  Stipulations such as these provide not only a call to action but a welcome reward for those many institutions that have already achieved Athena Swan status.CaSE welcomes this approach and encourages further linking of financial support to the adoption of best practice for gender equality. To this end, CaSE calls on the government to require Research Councils and the Technology Strategy Board to set the same eligibility requirements of an Athena SWAN award or similar for all institutions applying for grant funding.November 2013&#xa0; http://www.hesa.ac.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1898&amp;Itemid=239 http://www.wisecampaign.org.uk/ http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120228/text/120228w0005.htm http://royalsociety.org/policy/projects/leading-way-diversity/progress-report/ http://www.theukrc.org/files/useruploads/files/the_chemistry_phdwomensretention_tcm18-139215.pdf http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/20082/1/Family-Friendly_Working_What_a_Performance!_An_Analysis_of_the_Relationship_Between_the_Availability_of_Family-Friendly_Policies_and_Establishment_Performance.pdf http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/labour-market-statistics/march-2013/index-of-data-tables.html#tab-Employment-tables http://www.iop.org/policy/statistics/education/page_43188.html http://www.hesa.ac.uk/content/view/1897/239/ http://www.wisecampaign.org.uk/files/useruploads/files/wise_stats_document_final.pdf http://royalsociety.org/about-us/fellowship/ http://royalsociety.org/about-us/fellowship/election/ http://occamstypewriter.org/athenedonald/2012/10/14/the-self-promotion-stakes/ http://www.human.cornell.edu/hd/upload/Ceci-Williams_Cur_Dir_10-2010.pdf http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/09/14/1211286109.full.pdf http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7179/full/451605b.html http://www.daphnejackson.org/ http://www.womeninscience.co.uk/apply.php http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/Funding/Biomedical-science/Funding-schemes/Fellowships/Basic-biomedical-fellowships/wtd004380.htm http://careers.bmj.com/careers/advice/view-article.html?id=20011003 http://www.wisecampaign.org.uk/about-us/wise-resources/uk-statistics-2012 http://www.sciencecampaign.org.uk/documents/2008/CaSE0608.pdf http://sciencecampaign.org.uk/?tag=diversity http://www.medschools.ac.uk/SiteCollectionDocuments/Letter_from_Dame_Sally_Davies_-_Women_in_Science.pdf http://www.athenaswan.org.uk/content/athena-swan-awards-announced-november-2012-submissions http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/athena-swan-applications-soar/2003442.article https://www.gov.uk/government/news/400-million-will-help-science-and-engineering-students-get-ahead-in-the-global-race-and-encourage-more-women-to-study-these-subjects&#xa0;
