[[[Written evidence submitted by the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (LCI0019)]]]The Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) is the professional body that exists to:‘support the Science, Art and Practice of building services engineering, by providing our members and the public with first class information’ CIBSE members are the engineers who design, install, operate, maintain and refurbish the energy using systems installed in buildings, including homes, and are specifically trained in the design and installation of low carbon building fabric and the associated systems for the provision of heating and hot water, lighting, ventilation and cooling and small power distribution in homes.As an Institution CIBSE publishes Guidance and Codes which provide best practice advice and are internationally recognised as authoritative. The CIBSE Knowledge Portal, makes our Guidance available online to all CIBSE members and is the leading systematic engineering resource for the building services sector. Over the last two years it has been accessed over 200,000 times, and is used regularly by our members to access the latest guidance material for the profession. Currently we have users in over 170 countries, demonstrating the world leading position of UK engineering expertise in this field.CIBSE is pleased to respond to the Committee’s consultation on Low Carbon Innovation.

[[[Will the Government’s current approach towards low carbon innovation help to achieve the UK’s legal]]]

[[[ly binding targets at the lowest possible cost?]]]1. The associated NAO Report has quoted the IIASA Global Energy Assessment’s conclusion that innovation plays a key role in the delivery of a low carbon global economy. Many of the innovations that will be deployed over the next decades to meet the UK’s target will have been developed by industries abroad eager to capture global markets. European manufacturers are taking leading roles in technology like organic LED’s, High Voltage DC transmission and smart grid control. The Department inherited possibly the most incoherent programme of public sector research amongst its international peers, and its approach to consolidation and co-ordination is widely welcomed. Whether, when viewed in hindsight, this consolidation will be seen to have delivered the UK’s targets at the lowest cost, is a harder question. 2. Energy engineering, whether collecting biomass or distributing electrical power is a set of interconnected systems. Systems incorrectly analyzed deliver less than the sum of their parts.  This is as true in cutting edge low energy building design as it is in many other fields. Indeed this Institution has recently prioritised looking at city level energy systems as key to delivering the full promise of technology to meet low carbon targets. This important urban-level theme was also echoed in the IIASA report. We find the Governments innovation plans very patchy in resolving the inevitable systemic issues in target delivery. To achieve outcomes that are efficient and effective, innovation in deployment is at least, if not more critical, than innovation in components.3. Innovation in deployment requires a greater degree of integration between policies than is currently achieved. For example, there are several incentive schemes for the delivery of low carbon building technologies, the feed in tariff for photovoltaics and the renewable heat incentive for biomass heating, solar thermal and heat pump systems. When first launched none of these required any minimum level of energy efficiency to be present in buildings in receipt of the incentive payments, even though the installation of basic insulation and draft proofing would have delivered a far better return on investment than the investment in renewable systems. This clearly fails the test of delivering low carbon innovation at lowest cost. 4. In contrast the Department for Communities and Local Government, they have adopted a hierarchical approach to delivering “zero carbon” buildings, [[to include it would be a bit of a diversion]]This sets out the policy approach of seeking improvements in building fabric first, then seeking to reduce the emissions from the installed energy using systems, called carbon compliance, and only then looking to install renewables (or using “allowable solutions” instead). Whilst “allowable solutions” demonstrate innovation in low carbon accountancy, they are unlikely to drive innovation in low carbon technology.5. A further frequently overlooked aspect of low carbon innovation relates to its successful integration into buildings as complex systems. Buildings are responsible for almost half of UK carbon emissions, and many of those which emit the highest levels of carbon per unit floor area are the most complex. In theory, Building Regulations require that these buildings have their complex energy systems properly installed, tested, and commissioned, or put into practical operation. In practice, it is widely understood in the industry that the various minimum legal requirements to commission building services systems are honoured in the breach. 6. There is also evidence to suggest that the measures required by the energy performance of buildings regulations, which implement the eponymous Directive, are widely overlooked, leaving building owners individually, and DCLG, DECC and other policymakers unaware of current levels of energy performance of much of the building stock. It is therefore very hard to argue that low carbon building innovation is being delivered on the scale it should be, let alone at lowest cost. A strong driver for innovation would be if new buildings procured by Government were required to deliver a Display Energy Certificate rating of A in the relevant category. DEC’s focus on real out turns not simply design calculations made pre-tender.

[[[Q2.]]]

[[[Does the Government have the right balance of focus between energy efficiency, renewable energy and other low carbon technologies?]]]7. This Institution has long been concerned at the inverted pyramid of public sector funding for energy research.  Research that improves the efficiency and efficacy of energy use may be messy but that is not a reason to deprioritise it against far blue skies research agendas like fusion, which often have little industrial relevance to the UK. This issue goes far beyond a low carbon agenda. If international consensus was to fail and the UK carbon target was to fade, the economy still has the pressing problem of remaining globally competitive should its marginal fuel remain LNG, currently the most expensive fossil fuel of all. 8. Given the current levels of concern about the falling capacity margin in the wholesale electricity market, any policy which can deliver significant reductions in carbon emissions and energy demand has the potential to reduce the risk of power supply disruption. Energy efficiency, or enabling people not to use as much energy without impairing their comfort, enjoyment or productive use of buildings is the lowest cost route to reducing UK electricity and gas demand. It may not require huge levels of technical research, but some of the research into consumer behaviour and reaction to energy efficiency propositions shows that more needs to be done to deliver consumer acceptable low carbon building refurbishment.

[[[Q3. ]]]

[[[What outcomes, if any, are the LCICG likely]]]

[[[ to achieve? How should its forthcoming strategy drive more investment into low carbon innovation, and how should it measure success?]]]9. In the built environment sector, which is itself a significant part of the UK carbon footprint, market pull rather than technology push has been the defining paradigm of successful innovation. Unfortunately a procurement incentive plan with sufficient stability to create confidence has seldom been the outcome. &#xa0;10. For example level 6 of the Code for Sustainable Homes had been both a test bed for new technology and a market pull for better overall performance of housing. As Code levels became economically achievable by the industry at large they could be later encapsulated in Building Regulations. We now understand that in England at least (and possibly also Wales) the proposed Housing Standards Review will lead to a winding down of the Code and public sector housing procurement will no longer link to it.  An important incentive for innovation has therefore been removed in a critical area. Some of the leading specialist firms who have provided much of the innovation in this sector now face a difficult time, with little obvious prospect of their investments in levels 5 and 6 being profitable. If there were short comings with the Code, given its innovation importance, they should have been addressed rather than the Code abandoned.11. Closer to home, LCICG should look to the need for some stability in funding arrangements, and for smoother transitions between incentive schemes. The current hiatus over the Energy Company Obligation has led to an almost total moratorium on new projects being approved, with very serious implications for the specialists who provide installations under ECO. These installers have to be certificated under the Green Deal installer rules, a process which will have cost them. Now, without the regulated workstream they expected from the ECO, they have to compete on the open unregulated market with those variously described as “cowboy” or “rogue” traders, where they cannot hope to recoup the costs of investing in Green Deal approval and certification. Their learning curves gains from repeated quality installations will be dispersed. The changes to the ECO arrangements threaten to penalise those installers most likely to be working to and advancing good practice standards, and to reward those who stayed out of the ECO and Green Deal system. That is perverse. &#xa0;12. However, it is also a threat to future low carbon innovation schemes, as those who may consider becoming early investors will need to form a view on whether the scheme, and the political support for it, will be sufficiently robust to justify the risk of early participation. &#xa0;13. Current transitions in the feed in tariff and renewable heat incentive also appear to pay little heed to the collateral damage caused by abrupt change and funding hiatus. Specialist firms, and those most likely to provide innovative solutions, suffer most. In the present SME banking climate the effect can be terminal, and only odd job cowboy contractors survive.&#xa0;14. The Committee has asked for views on metrics. Experience suggests that metrics can cause more harm than good unless they closely reflect the objectives. The problems associated wioth a patents metric provides a good example. Finding a faster, cheaper way to install a solar collector is never likely to obtain a patent, but would revolutionize the market since insulation costs now dominate. We note that the LCICG naturally chose patents as one possibility, without necessarily recognizing that this could distort priorities. &#xa0;15. In the market to retrofit low carbon solutions to existing buildings, the most significant innovations are likely to be process related, and not product related. Working out how to create a package of cost effective measures to improve the worst housing in a cost effective manner will require innovation, but not patents. Perhaps metrics need to be applied to successful outcomes in the form of measurable low carbon results in buildings. The emphasis needs to be on measured practical low carbon outcomes on site, and not on predicted theoretical results in a building simulation or design. 

[[[Q4. ]]]

[[[Are the Government &amp; LCICG targeting investment]]]

[[[ towards the most effective stages of the innovation process, including over the long-term?]]]16. We do not believe that is currently true for the built environment. While enthusiasts often promote the idea of learning rates to justify investment in expensive renewables technology, it is hard to see how the argument can apply when there is so little investment in collecting data from which to learn.  Integrating heat pumps into heating systems is a case in point. Manufacturers’ test data suggested impressive performance from the latest models. But it required an initiative by the Energy Savings Trust to actually test the field performance of some 80 installations. Needless to say because of a lack of knowledge about critical systems integration issues the actual performance was disappointing. Yet CERT had installed some 8,000 heat pump installations without any feedback or learning.  NAO recently commented on the general lack of feedback information during their review of the Levy Control Framework.17. It is even impossible to access statutory Display Energy Certificate (DEC) data in quantity online without incurring significant fees, despite the availability of benchmarking data being critical for the confident roll out of new technology. Although energy performance data is essential to the improvement of our building stock, DCLG is tied into a contract for the management of the national database of energy certificate data under which access to the data is only available at considerable expense. In the case of DEC data, which is required to be displayed in public buildings, and is therefore publicly available data, to obtain that data in aggregate form from Landmark is prohibitively expensive. 

[[[Q5. ]]]

[[[What is the impact of the short-term funding timelines on privat]]]

[[[e sector investment?]]]18. The Institution can only offer an observation. Modern R&amp;D is a fast moving area. For example smart grids built today might be obsolete in 5 years time such is the pace of IT technology. What is often a greater disincentive than funding length, especially when trying to incorporate new technology into a real project, is the front end delay in obtaining final approval from a support scheme.  Whether delays are unavoidable it is hard to say from the outside, but our own research fund can make allocative decisions within weeks.

[[[Q6. ]]]

[[[How should DECC ensure that its remaining capital allocation for low carbon innovation will be spent wisely, after two years of underspend?]]]19. The Institution suggests that the Committee might wish to enquire whether the underspend relates in part to Departmental staffing levels.  In other areas of Government recent staff reductions have had a disproportionate reduction in in-house technical skills able to process projects with confidence.20. The Department might consider that any initiative to increase spending should focus on improving system integration and outcomes, and on measuring actual practical performance of some of the early installations under the various existing schemes.

[[[Q7. ]]]

[[[How is the Governmen]]]

[[[t maximising opportunities to learn from and partner with international partners within and beyond the EU?]]]21. CIBSE’s membership is worldwide.  We work closely with our US sister organisation ASHRAE and we are an active member in the Europe wide equivalent REHVA.  Most of the public sector research is indeed in the public domain, and many of the companies involved in innovation are themselves global in reach. Possibly the starkest comparison is in the style of innovation procurement. The US Department of Energy funds large programmes through experienced prime contractors, much as the 1970’s UK Department of Energy used the UKEA to run the programmes of the Energy Efficiency Office. US Government is also a strong provider of market pull for innovation, especially the Department of Defense. This May, for example, DOD connected its Fort Bliss embedded generation system into the Texas power grid, showcasing Lockheed smart grid controllers.  In Europe large metropolitan authorities are frequently involved in the procurement of innovative solutions such as advanced waste combustion and heat distribution. The power of informed and challenging procurement along the technology strategy trajectory is noticeable by its absence in the UK programmes.December 2013&#xa0; See the report on the EPSRC funded CALEBRE project on energy efficient renovation of homes.
