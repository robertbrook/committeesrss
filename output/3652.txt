That is not to say a growth stimulus is entirely absent. In 1997 the European Commission estimated that the major TENS would add only 0.25 per cent to EU GDP, and 0.11 per cent to employment over the next 25 years. The literature review of Preston and Wall produced the conclusion that the growth of HSRs was likely to lie within the modest range of 1-3 per cent of GDP.”November 2013&#xa0;
