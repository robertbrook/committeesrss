default&#xa0;
default1.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe policies set out within the Command Paper addresses largely regional traffic, focusing on cars and HGVs in particular. The policy also makes reference to “future proofing” the strategic network for cycling. The policy however does not reference to
default or provide any identified investment in the local road network, of which responsibility lies with Local Authorities. It needs to be 
defaultrecognised
default that the vast majority of trips either start or end on these 
defaultroads,
default and that investment needs to also be directe
defaultd towards supporting maintenance of the rest of the highway network, including associated bridges and other related infrastructure.
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe policy does not provide much information regarding other road users, in particular short-bus trips and long-distance co
defaultach routes which may also 
defaultutilise
default the strategic road network as modes.
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn addition, as these roads generally operate at high speed (50mph or higher) it is accepted that the roads need to be as safe as possible. This is reflected within the command paper t
defaulto some extent for vehicles and future proofing for cyclists, but little reference is made regarding the potential risk for pedestrian and rights of way related casualties that can occur on the strategic network, in particular at uncontrolled level crossing
defaults over dual carriageways for rights of way. Due to both vehicular speeds and high risk of fatalities, some form of segregation may be required where possible for hazardous locations, which should be identified within the route based strategies, in particul
defaultar at locations where high KSI accidents occur.
default&#xa0;
default1.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultBy making the best use of the existing highway network through use of selective junction improvements and removing bottlenecks, the policy has the potential to 
defaultimprove
default the environment by mitigating traffic c
defaultongestion and 
defaultminimising
default the need for the provision of entirely new construction.
default&#xa0;
defaultHow does the Government’s policy for roads link with planning for other transport modes? default&#xa0;
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe form proposed here is similar to that of the rail industry which has been show
defaultn to work
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe role of Park and Ride should be 
defaultrecognised
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLong terms planning of altern
defaultative modes such as rail lines should not be detrimentally affected by highways infrastructure proposals
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe policy need to link with the growth at sea and airports
default&#xa0;
default1.5
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe p
defaultolicy for roads follows a similar policy process for that of rail, with a long term strategy based on five year funding rounds, developed alongside smaller 
defaultRoute Based Strategies, which mirrors a similar method of Control Periods and Route 
defaultUtilisation
default Stra
defaulttegies published by Network Rail. This form of planning has been shown to work within the rail industry, and should potentially work for the development of the highways network.
default&#xa0;
default1.6
default&#xa0; 
defaultOne of the most direct links to other transport modes is for that of Park and
default Ride schemes, both bus and rail orientated. The 
defaultsiting
default of 
defaulta
default effective Park and ride site will help reduce congestion within towns and cities, and will most likely require being sited next to the strategic highway network to be effective.
default&#xa0;
default1.7
default&#xa0; 
defaultAn additional in
defaultteraction exists relating to the crossing of other transport infrastructure, including rail and canals. Significant planning is required to ensure that any future reinstatement of a rail line for instance is not detrimental and pushed up in cost through th
defaulte development of a new road for instance. In addition, the maintenance or replacement of bridges and removal of level crossings require coordination between both parties to ensure that both modes see an advantage and not cause unnecessary maintenance liabi
defaultlity on one mode.
default&#xa0;
default1.8
default&#xa0; 
defaultFinally, the policy needs to link into the proposed growth of both airports and ports, both for the effective and efficient handling of freight and passengers to access these facilities. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHow reliable is the Government’s forecast for grdefaultowth in demand for the strategic road network? How should the Government deal with uncertainty in its forecast?default&#xa0;
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Highways Agency must liaise with local authorities on impact of strategic highway network on local development
default&#xa0;
default1.9
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Highways Agency needs t
defaulto liaise with local authorities and the City Regions regarding the impact on the strategic highway network of local economic development, of both housing, retail and employment locations, which all may generate additional traffic. This information should t
defaulthen be used to inform the potential traffic growth expected within the area.
default&#xa0;
default1.10
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTraffic demand on the strategic network is determined by a number of factors that can determine use, and may help inform forecasts. These include:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default1.11
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe proposals within
default “Action for Roads” indicates that road funding should be determined in five-year funding rounds. Each funding round should, like the rail industry, focus on delivering specific outputs and ensuring sustainability of the network. Regarding the forecast gro
defaultwth, the funding rounds should collect robust data regarding demand, which can closely monitor the levels of actual demand and adjust accordingly.
default&#xa0;
defaultHow can we improve the reliability and efficiency of travel on the strategic road network? What impact will defaultnew technology have?default&#xa0;default default&#xa0;
default- The use of system can make capacity improvements with any need for any 
defaultcicvils
default work to upgrade a junction
default&#xa0;
default1.12
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe use of technology is having an increasing role and importance in maintaining the effectiveness of traveling on the 
defaultstrategic road network. This is already demonstrated in the use of “managed motorways” of using the hard shoulder during peak periods, and the deployment of VMS signs to inform road users of delay and disruption.
default&#xa0;
default1.13
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe wider deployment of this technology 
defaultacross the network will have benefits in terms of both capacity and flexibility at times of disruption. The deployment of technology however is much wider. The deployment for instance of Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) or Bluetooth opens up possi
defaultbilities of monitoring traffic flows across the network. In addition, enforcement use for uninsured vehicles and speeding could potentially 
defaultutilise
default these technologies.
default&#xa0;
default1.14
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAt 
defaultsignalised
default junctions, the upgrade of the signals to 
defaultutilise
default MOVA or SCOOT systems pr
defaultovides a chance to provide additional capacity to the road network at pinch points.

defaultWhat mechanisms are there for Government to increase investment in strategic roads and attract new investors? Are there good examples from other countries that could be apdefaultplied in the UK?default&#xa0;default default&#xa0;
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhatever mechanism are introduced it is important that these are fully consulted on. New mechanism introduced may increase funding for the strategic road network it is important that this must not be to the detriment and cost of the loc
defaultal Highway Network and the local economy.
