defaultDear Sir,
default&#xa0;
defaultIn his evidence to your committee Lord McNally, the UK minister with responsibility for Crown Dependencies, said that he felt 
defaulta 
defaultsense of failure with Sark. This failure in my submission stems from a lack of attention to your committee
default’s comments in their
default eighth report; in particular their comments about how individuals wielding very significant economic, legal and political power in a very small jurisdiction may skew the operation of democratic government there. 
default&#xa0;
defaultLord McNally’s department has not manifested 
defaultin their dealings with Sark 
defaultany policy directed at combating this combination of power. Instead, since your eighth report, the department has continued, wittingly or unwittingly, to encourage Sark to learn how to appease rather than cope with the Barclays’ combination of powers. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe result is that the threat to the ability of democratic government in Sark to operate fairly and robustly is now greater than ever. No Conseiller is willing to chair the General 
defaultPurposes 
defaultand 
defaultAdvisory Co
defaultmmittee, there are four vacancies in Chief Pleas itself and there are difficulties persuading people to stand in the by election to fill those vacancies. 
default&#xa0;
defaultInevitably this combination of powers perpetuates a division between 
defaultthe 
defaultBarcla
defaultys on the one hand 
defaultand
default the
default rest of Sark 
defaulton the other hand. However the 
defaultdepartment has tried (unsuccessfully) to characterise this division as a
defaultn even spread 
defaultof opinion between 
defaultSarkees; 
defaultmodernisers and luddites. The department’s characterisation is not
default supported by the
default evidence
default; not least the 
defaultresults of
default the
default three general elections
default in Sark. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe BBC’s Today programme and Panorama have both done much to spotlight this combination of power but this has not brought about any change of policy in the department.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe minister’s acknowledgement of 
defaultf
defaultailure with Sark would be refreshing if it heralds a change of policy by the department. If not, the need for intervention is closer than it was at the time of your committee’s eighth report, in my view.
default&#xa0;
defaultYours sincerely
default&#xa0;
