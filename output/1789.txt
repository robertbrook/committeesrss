[[[Geoffrey and Julia Queen – Written evidence]]]&#xa0;As residents of The Yorkshire Dales National Park we are strongly opposed to the desecration of historic Green Lanes in the area by recreational  4 x 4 vehicles and motor  cycles.  These are causing irreparable damage to the environment, noise pollution and detrimental effect to wildlife.&#xa0;We support the following two proposals:-&#xa0;&#xa0;We also expressly support the formal submissions made by The Green Lanes Environmental Action Group (GLEAG), by The Green Lanes Protection Group (GLPG), by The Peak District Green Lanes Alliance (PDGLA) and our own Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance (YDGLA).&#xa0;We trust these proposals will be considered.&#xa0;&#xa0;4 September 2013&#xa0;
