"&#xa0;\nRathbone—Written EvidenceHouse of Lords \nInquiry into \nEU \nYouth Unemployment\n&#xa0;\nRathbone believe\ns\n th\ne\n \nnew \nEU action to tackle youth unemployment does respe\nct individual Member States powers in the areas of social and employment affairs. \nI\nndividual states are able to provide any additional \nnecessary \ninterventions\n, providing measures and\n restrictions to EU initiatives\n. They can\n ensure that these are consistent \nwith \nand can be accommodated \nwithin\n \nnational \nand\n regional \neconomic and social conditions\n, f\nor example, taking account of the difference between rural and urban economies and social conditions.\nWe\n further believe the\n proble\nm of youth unemployment\n across the EU\n is so great\n today\n that there is the \npotenti\nal \nfor serious social \nand economic \nconsequences of not addressing the situation\n.\n The economic productivity of Member States is based on having a skilled and flexible workforce\n. Long term youth unemployment reduces competitive advantage and increases welfare dependency with associated poor health impacts.  \n.\n Many Member States are struggling with wider economic conditions and without EU support would\n not be able to tackle the\n is\nsue\n of youth unemployment\n without \ncross bord\ner transnational interventions.\nWe would also like to make the point that the 6 \nB\nillion \nE\nuros that has been \ncommitted\n to tackle youth unemployment\n via the YEI\n is a very low amount\n of\n funding in comparison to the problem,\n r\nepresenting around 850 \nE\nuros per individual young unemployed person\n.\nRathbone\n recommend that it is the Member State which i\ns asked to provide any ma\ntch funding required for\n programmes rather than individual organisations\n and \nservice delivery is then publically procured. \n Moreover, that a differentiated approach is adopted in the allocation of funding to better reflect Member S\ntates particular economic and social conditions. It is further recommended that a differentiated approach is applied more vigorously within countries receiving funding. \nFurthermore, the restrictions of YEI funds to those Member States with\n youth unemploym\nent above 25%\n signif\nicantly\n disadvant\nages\n those nations who have pockets\n of youth unemployment above 25% for example Ireland, UK, Netherlands\n but\n where \n the national percen\ntage is below the 25% threshold making it ineligible for YEI funding. We agree and s\ntrongly support the introduction of \nEU \nYo\nuth Action Teams to instruct and support Member States to reprofile their European Structural Funds towards reducing youth unemploymen\nt. There is an obvious problem when\n collectively EU Member States are currently s\npending more on subsidies for cows than on initiatives to reduce youth unemployment.  \nThe priority now needs to be the implementation of the YEI \nprogramme and wider ESF initiatives as the need\ns\n of young people who are unemployed, som\ne for many\n years now are becoming more pressing.\n In summary, to ensure success there needs to be a greater effort to ensure all the interventions are joined up as a com\nprehensive action plan\n.\n Overarching coordination is vital if we are to avoid a piecemeal approach. Solving youth unemployment cannot be achieved with isolated interventions; these need to include addressing wider policy issues such as education, \nsocial wel\nfare and mobility for young people.\n30 October 2013\n&#xa0;\n Work Foundation Research Paper June 2012 ‘Short Term Crisis – Long Term Problem”\n"
