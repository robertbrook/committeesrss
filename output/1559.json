"&#xa0;\nW\nritten evidence\n \nfrom\n \nSusan Hedley\n (TIC 051)\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSummaryIncluding\nespecially \nfor\n reaching \npotential passengers as well as existing ones, \nand those travelling long distances to access the public transport network (see 3.5)\nEVIDENCE BASE FOR THE NORTHUMBERLAND LOCAL TRANSPORT  PLAN 2011-2026 - a howl of anguish from passengers.  -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nno publicity about this questionnaire on any of the buses (3.7.ii)\nNo recognition that rural communities have a strong tradition and basis in cultural and family links, needing to be supported by public transport. and for day-to-day service changes\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;2)  A personal view of public transport policy and implementation from a regularly and long-used bus seat2.1              Being\n a regular bus user on both \nurban and rural routes o\nver \n40 years, starting with schooldays travelling from Windyhaugh in the upper Coquet valley to Morpeth, Northumberland, and then \nworking \nin various places \nfrom\n East London \nto\n mid Wales, Worcestershire \nto\n Middlesbrough,\n return\ning\n to \nNorthumberland \nregularly using public transport, I have had plenty of opportunity for comparison.  \n2.2              For the last 9 years I have been in Northumberland, using the Thropton to Newcastle route for \nat least \n5 return journeys per week between Longframlington and Morpeth\n, \nmostly \nfor work\n or \nto connect to other destinations, so I have been able to observe all of the c\nhanges on this route since 1971.\n2.3               I \nam\n submit\nting\n this evidence because I have full awareness of how \nimportant the bus service is for \nwe\n passengers \nin all aspects of life, and not just to access shops and basic services.  A\nnyone \nnot\n a \nregular \nrural \nbus user \nhas\n no conception of this, \nas\n is reflected \nby\n policies and implementation \nfor\n \nrural \nbus services \n.\n2.4              Also I think that the best \nhope\n for rural \npublic \ntransport is to enable a proper \nnetwork to be \nrun profitably, \nin recent\n years\n \nhindered by deteriorating communication with existing passengers and lack of contact with potential passengers, largely \nbecause of \n \nthe \nconstraints \nof funding structures\n.\n2.5              Profitable and appropriate running of public transport in rural areas is hindered by looking at the funding of each route in isolation, instead of examining it as part of an effective and usable public transport network.2.6              S\nources:\n              \n&#xa0;\n              \n3)  \nHow do government and local authorities identify demand for passenger transport in isolated communities?3.1              Though \nthere were \nsurveys in previous decades, in the last nine years, despite making \nminimu,\n five return journeys per week between Longframlington and Morpeth,  I \nhave only \nseen one\n County Council survey, in spring 2011, and \none\n done by a national \norganization\n, though I have heard that another \nwas done\n this spring driver \nabout a specific\n p\nroposed change \nto\n our timetable.\n3.2              O\nur parish council has asked for people to notify them of their public transport ne\neds via our parish newsletter, as has \nRothbury, Thropton,  and upper Coquetdale, but until very recently, Longhorsley, the other main vi\nllage on our bus route did not have such a publication.\n3.3              Our \nweekly, “Northumberland Gazette” cover\ns\n public transport\n,\n publishing a paragraph or two during a  consultation, but usually at the very end of the consultation period.  Is this due to tardy di\nssemination of information by the County Council, or to editorial policy.? \n3.4              C\nonsultation documents are quite complex, and so only really useable online.  \nA\nn unusually\n high\n proportion of \nbus passengers \nprobably \ndo\nn’t have access to\n computer\ns\n, particularly in rural areas \nlacking in \nbroadband \nand decent mobile phone \nsignals\n, leaving \npaper documents available at libraries\n. I\nf people \nrely\n on public transport, they\n might only \nget\n to the nearest place with a library one day a week for an hour or tw\no \nto \ndo essential tasks, so would not \nhave\n time to peruse and respond to a consultation.\n3.5              At a public meeting in Felton, I think in October 2011, \nabout cutting \nbus services to Newton-on-the -Moor and Swarland, \nattended by \n councillors, council officers,\n and Arriva\n representatives \n, it was stated that one of the main ways for determining passenger demand was counting the ticket numbers on services. \nLocal users replied that this could only be done on services which existed, and it did nothing for people needing a bus service which currently didn’t exist, especially if they had to get a lift to the nearest bus route, often a great distance away \nThough  common practice in urban public transport surveys is  to ask people how far and how they travel to and from the service being surveyed, this is not done in Northumberland.Most regular passengers using \nweekly passes \nsuspect\n that they \nare\n waved onto the bus without being counted\n.\n              \n3.6              On regular drivers who know the route and passengers well.  \nT\nheir employers \nprobably do\nn\n’\nt make enough use of their local knowledge, and could run a better s\nervice if they did. I\nt is\n only because of these drivers’ \npersonal dedication that this service operate\ns\n effectively.\n              \n3.7.i              I \narrived back in Northumberland in \ntime to see the five year Local Transport Plan 2006-2011 apparently voted in by the County Council befor\ne the consultation period ended.\n In autumn 2010, \nhaving discovered\n the name of the Commercial Manager at Arriva\n,\n I \nprepared\n for the forthcoming 2011 Loc\nal Transport Plan by giving out address cards with the Arriva manager’s name and head office address in Sunderland to anyone who I heard making a comment about the state of the bus service, \nhoping\n that it might encourage the decision-makers to pay \nmore\n att\nention to our needs and experiences.  I was much surprised by the number of people who \nlater \ntold me that they had written letters, even those who had said “they won’t listen to us anyway”.  \nApparently \nthe Arriva management also got a surprise.  \nii                Later\n, questionnaires were distributed to passengers on the Rothbury and A1 routes in Northumberland, \nand \ncollated \nin\n the \nEVIDENCE BASE FOR THE NORTHUMBERLAND LOCAL TRANSPORT  2011-2026, giving the impression of a howl of anguish from passengers.  There was no publicity about this questionnaire on any of the buses, \nand it was mostly distributed by passengers who got further copies of it themselves\n, and distributed it to everyone they could either on the buses or door-to-door.  Even so, I later heard from ma\nny passengers who had still had no idea that a consultation was taking place.\niii                Presusmably  this was because, as a subsidised service, Arriva ran it under contract for the County Council, and it  did not cover operating consultations or publicity.              It is probably not in Arriva’s interests to facilitate a profitable and effective service if they can get money by contracting to run a service for  the County Council without investing  in market research or promotion.  Few County Council resources available to do this.On \n“THE BOTTOM LINE” ON BBC RADIO 4 ON 19/11/11, I HEARD DAVID MARTIN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF ARRIVA UK \nappeared to say that\nthere was no money in running public transport services, but Arriva forecast healthy growth by getting  money for running services for councils.&#xa0;              3.8              Apparently\n the \nRECENT QUESTIONNAIRE FOR THE FEASIBILITY STUDY FOR THE PROPOSED REINTRODUCTION OF REGULAR BUS SERVICES BETWEEN ALWINTON AND \nALNWICK VIA ROTHBURY BY A NEW COMPANY\n, SPIRITBUSES OF ROTHBURY, has uncovered a huge and desperate demand, exemplified \nby \nseveral of we potential passengers \ngetting \na supply of questionnaires and voluntarily distributed them on buses, and door-to-door.\n&#xa0;3.9              See\n \nmy submission\n \nto the \nNORTHUMBERLAND CORE STRATEGY 2015-2030 PREFERRED \nOPTIONS\n  \nCONSULTATION,  TRANSPORT SECTION,  QUESTION 43:  \nTo base a planning strategy on a vision where the majority of the county is rural, but “where the use of public transport for the journey to work and to school is considered socially necessary but \nis not commercially viable, the local authority \nmay\n provide revenue support for services”[Northumberland Economic Strategy p.23] is LUDICROUS.\nIn the Local Transport Plan 2011-2026 Strategy Document there are 17 principle elements of the new bus strategy, \nbut \nnone of them mention working with or involving the LOCAL BUSINESSES WHOSE EMPLOYEES AND CUSTOMERS ARE USERS OF THE BUS SERVICE, and who might wish for more bus use in order to free up the oversubscribed car parking spaces for a larger number of customers, and a better network of buses to attract more tourists(e.g. Dutch tourists, 7% of whom expect to use public transport, our nearest neighbours on the ferry)\n                            &#xa0;4)  To what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?&#xa0;              4.1              Many special interest groups such as the elderly, frail and vulnerable, and to some extent, young people, are probably very much on the County Council’s radar, and quite a large p\nroportion of available resources are put into supporting the introduction and operation of community buses, but these are often only usable for people who are in a position to book in advance in quite small time-slots. \nThese, and the excellent car-share s\nchemes implemented by the County Council, \nare not suitable for the growing number of people who are struggling to afford a car to get to work, or look for work, and who are increasingly expected to work unusual shifts or at short notice, or both (zero hour\ns contracts etc.), or who simply want to reduce global warming by using public transport \n&#xa0;4.2              T\neenagers \nseem\n to be the least informed about chan\nges to bus timetables etc.,\n though public transport has been one of the main campaigning issues of the National\n Youth Parliament for 2 years running, and youngsters are readily in touch via social media.  \nProbably an effective route for communicating with them has not been established.\n4.3              Apparently no recognition that rural communities have a strong tradition and basis in cultural and family links, which needs to be supported by public transport (especially in the absence of accessible computer services and tuition).\n&#xa0;It isn’t just about taking people into town centres to access increasingly centralised services which have been withdrawn from rural areas.It is about allowing people to be able to continue seeing and supporting relatives and friends in neighbouring communities, get to family graves to tend them, recognising that sick people don’t just need medical services, but visitors as well (e.g. no Sunday services)\n, allowing access to local meetings so that they are not excluded from democracy, and local cultural events and activities to maintain the cohesion of the community For some people \nliving\n on their own, or whose partners are in hospital, \ntheir fellow passengers and \nthe bus-drivers \ncan be\n the\nir most important \nsource of company and support.  \nBuses are a good and rare meeting place for \ndifferent sections of the community who might not otherwise meet \ne.g. young and old, native and newcomer, people with and without children,\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5) What are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities?  How can these challenges be overcome?&#xa0;\n5.1              Communicating with passengers and\n potential passengers \n(see section 3)\na\nnd\n, \nfor\n \nday-to-day service changes, recognition from \ne.g.\n Arriva, who say that we can use Facebook or Twitter, that an\n unusually high proportion of their passengers don’t have access\n to or knowledge of these, and \nmany of the most essential journeys are outside of office hours. Arriva’s number for enquiries \nis\n only open during office hours, with no \nn\numbers for \n“\nlocal\n” depo\nts. T\nheir Facebook page \nis\n only updated during office hours.\nThere are no information offices on the Thropton route outside of Newcastle.\n5.2              Accurately establishing the need.  \nPeople have had to give up going to places, make \nunreliable or inefficient \nad \nhoc arrangements, or get a car when finances or environmental principles make it preferable that they did not.\nIf a new service is put in place, especially if it is not publicised, or has not been properly researched to make sure that it best fits peoples’ needs, it takes some time for people to find out about and transfer back to trusting and relying on public tra\nnsport.  If \n, as usual \nit has been a tr\nial period of only a\n year\n, there\n is not time to build up a base of new \nand\n previous customers, and the service is then \nirrevocably cut\n due to “lack of demand”.  (Many passengers have \nconcluded\n that this\n is probably on\ne of the main objective\ns when designing “trial periods”).\ne.g. the recent history of the Newton-on-the-Moor and Swarland bus service, which was \nno use for workers\n, and only catered for a small section of the community before it was cut altogether.\n              \n5.3              Rou\ngh roads and reliability in winter – better integration \nwith\n highways dept\ns\n – ensur\ning better gritting times,\n passing places, and parking\n \n/dumping space\ns\n for snow so that cars aren’t parked on roads and buses can get through safely.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6)  How effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities?  How could Community Transport be improved?&#xa0;See section 4.1\n&#xa0;7) To what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxi and other demand-responsive transport services?This discriminates against some of the groups who actually rely on the buses, who have not got enough money to run a car, so couldn’t afford a taxi either.\nMaybe more could be done to look into taxi-share schemes\n&#xa0;8)  The main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities?  How can these services be made more affordable?8.1              J\nudging from a public meeting about the Wooler  to Newcastle bus service in March 2013, the County Council is oblig\ned to pay for the free journeys made by pensioners, but is given no funds \nfor it, presumably \nmean\ning\n that \navailable\n funds are drawn to the most used, \nbut possibly less\n socially essential routes, so that people on busy urban bus routes get much more value f\nor money and use of their pensioners’ passes \nthan people in rural areas can.\n, but free bus travel for \nall pensioners, whether rural or urban is essential – see section 4.\n8.2              Do everything to make rural bus services more profitable, by effective market res\nearch and promotion, \nsee\n section 3. \n8.3              Funding an area’s rural transport as a whole network, rather than looking at individual routes \nseparately. This \nonly results in constant cuts, \nrendering\n the network useless for increasing number\ns\n of dedicated passengers, and necessitat\ning\n larger subsidies for the remaining few.\n8.4              W\ne are all being exhorted to reduce emissions, \nbut \nrural bus services \nare \nalways being cut, despite more and more essential services and facilities being withdrawn from\n rural areas and centralised, so needing people to make more and longer journeys –\ninclude funding for rural public transport as part of any centralization project or cost-benefit analysis?&#xa0;Recommendations&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n              \n              \n1\n"
