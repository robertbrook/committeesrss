[[[to the inquiry on keeping primates as pets]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Animal Defenders International ]]]campaigns across the globe on animals in entertainment, providing technical advice to governments, securing progressive animal protection legislation, drafting regulations and rescuing animals in distress. ADI has a worldwide reputation for providing video and photographic evidence exposing the behind-the-scenes suffering in industry and supporting this evidence with scientific research on captive wildlife and transport. ADI rescues animals all over the world and educates the public on animals and environmental issues. We are submitting evidence to this inquiry as we have campaigned for years on the abuse of primates in entertainment, science and as pets and on ending their trafficking. We produced a much cited report in 2006, documenting this abuse and welfare issues arising from captivity, My Mate’s A Primate.

[[[ and are being applied effectively; ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As previously highlighted, the regulatory framework is completely inadequate, with no monitoring of data on trade or ownership, some species of primates not being classified and reported low compliance. ADI has identified important welfare considerations in the lack of regulation in the UK, (8) firstly because the DWAA is primarily designed to protect people and is not concerned with animal welfare and secondly, because standards of welfare cannot be monitored if local authorities do not know of, or are not required to have knowledge of, primates in their constituency. Commercial operators are required to conform to the standards laid down in the Pet Animals Act 1951. The point at which a person becomes a commercial operator as opposed to someone simply selling the occasional offspring of their pet may be ambiguous. Furthermore, anybody or individual may call themselves a sanctuary and thus avoid regulation altogether. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
