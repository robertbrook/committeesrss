defaultImproving public health outcomes is critical and Nuffield Health is uniquely 
defaultpositioned as a Third Sector 
defaultorganisation
default to achieve long-term, scalable, and leading-edge innovations across the UK healthcare sector. No other healthcare group can combine the freedom to act solely in the interests of the public, with the ability to deli

defaultutilise
default the benefits and independence endowed by our not-for-profit status to consider and meet the genuine needs
default of the UK health consumer.

defaultWe identified people’s health and wellbeing needs and then applied evidence-based propositions to create ‘joined-up’ healthcare:

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default2005: 
defaultSona
default Positive Health acquired. Combined with Nu

default7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default2007: Cannons Health &amp; Fitness acquired. Combined with Nuffield’s clinical expertise to offer personal wellbein

default8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default2008: Nuffield Hospitals, Nuffield Proactive Health and Cannons united as Nuffield Health, providing ‘joined-up’ healthcare: integrated fitness, prevention and cure across different services and facilities.

defaultIn 2012 alone: Group turnover increased 12% and £69m was invested in improving and expanding our services.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Nuffield Health Bond, launched May 2013, is a five-year fixed-term product, offering a fixed annual return of 6% (gross) in cash, for investments of £1,000 - £250,000. Our initial aim, to raise £15m, was reached early due to a phenomenal response that 
defaultresulted in the Bond being over-subscribed - a gratifying endorsement of the Nuffield Health proposition in a depressed bond market. Ultimately the Bond raised £18m to help us make a real difference to the future of healthcare. 
default19.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNuffield Health has the bes
defaultt balance sheet in the private health sector (compared to gym or private hospital operators). We are the least leveraged businesses in the industry and our debt represents less than 25% of our overall value. Alexander Harrison, Director Strategic Debt Fina
defaultnce, Barclays Commercial Bank, 2008: “Nuffield Health has a very strong balance sheet with a low ratio of debt relative to the sector, further reinforcing their market position.”

defaultmore major awards than any other comparable competitor
default, spanning every area relating to healthcare. During the same period we have gained numerous professional accreditations as benchmarks of the highest levels of care.
default&#xa0;defaultRemunerationdefault68.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNuffield Health has a Remuneration Committee, comprising trustees of the cha

defaultive contributions to the 
defaultorganisation’s
default overall performance.

default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWith respect to executive remuneration, the Committee has delegated authority from Nuffield Health’s Board of Governors to determine the remuneration package for all senior executives including 
defaultthe Chief Executive.
default70.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNuffield Health remuneration package: total compensation, including pension contributions, bonuses and other benefits, is positioned at 75% of the market median (median rate, discounted by 25%) for the reference market. [E.G. if there
default are 11 companies in the comparative market group for a role, and the total compensation level for each company is ranked from lowest to highest, the median level is that of the company positioned in the middle at 6th place. We benchmark at this point and 
defaultthen apply a further 25% discount to determine the level of remuneration].

default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOur trustees conduct an independent annual review of executive remuneration and view the salaries of our executives as being at the a
defaultppropriate level to attract and retain the talent required to sustain the success of the charity.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;
