[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Written evidence [bold]from[bold] Nuffield Health [bold][CEP0008][bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Summary[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Public benefit delivered[bold]1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our charitabl
[normal]e purpose defines our business. All of our services, treatments and facilities, and the funding that enables them, is dedicated to augmenting the nation’s health and wellbeing. 
[normal]2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Improving public health outcomes is critical and Nuffield Health is uniquely 
[normal]positioned as a Third Sector 
[normal]organisation
[normal] to achieve long-term, scalable, and leading-edge innovations across the UK healthcare sector. No other healthcare group can combine the freedom to act solely in the interests of the public, with the ability to deli
[normal]ver across a range of services, and the flexibility to take a panoramic view. Our carefully built and managed financial strength permits us to 
[normal]utilise
[normal] the benefits and independence endowed by our not-for-profit status to consider and meet the genuine needs
[normal] of the UK health consumer.
[normal]3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Accessibility to our services matters deeply. Our Trustees review this regularly and report annually.
[normal] 
[normal]13% of our revenue comes from products and services that are less than £1 per day, and approximately 20% of our revenues are p
[normal]rovided from services that are free at the point of delivery – predominately from NHS contracts. We also offer free hea
[normal]lthcare education to the public
[normal] and 
[normal]hold over 650 events 
[normal]annually.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Empowering our ability to help [bold]4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Nuffield Health never stops trying to
[normal] better our provision of care and to develop the vision that delivers it.
[normal]5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We identified people’s health and wellbeing needs and then applied evidence-based propositions to create ‘joined-up’ healthcare:
[normal]6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]2005: 
[normal]Sona
[normal] Positive Health acquired. Combined with Nu
[normal]ffield Hospital’s physiotherapy and health assessment services to create the UK’s first employee wellbeing business – Nuffield Proactive Health.
[normal]7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]2007: Cannons Health &amp; Fitness acquired. Combined with Nuffield’s clinical expertise to offer personal wellbein
[normal]g services to the individual.
[normal]8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]2008: Nuffield Hospitals, Nuffield Proactive Health and Cannons united as Nuffield Health, providing ‘joined-up’ healthcare: integrated fitness, prevention and cure across different services and facilities.
[normal]9.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]2010: 
[normal]Bladerunner
[normal] c
[normal]orporate fitness acquired. Expands Nuffield Health’s employee wellbeing offer across the UK.
[normal]10.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]2012: Greens Health &amp; Fitness acquired. Extends Nuffield Health’s personal wellbeing offer across the UK.
[normal]11.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We continue to expand our investment 
[normal]programme
[normal], membershi
[normal]p levels, access and revenues.
[normal]12.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]£246m has been reinvested into infrastructure, staff, services, support and facilities over the last five years. In a challen
[normal]ging debt market, we secured £27
[normal]0m 
[normal]in loans 
[normal]to support the on-going implementation of our innovative
[normal] strategy.
[normal]13.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Group turnover grew from £552m in 2010, to
[normal] 
[normal]£645m in 2012, with cash generation (EBITDA) increased by 21%.
[normal]14.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In 2012 alone: Group turnover increased 12% and £69m was invested in improving and expanding our services.
[normal]15.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]2012: Almost 500,000 hospital 
[normal]patients; 191,000 consumer fitness and wellbeing centre members; 104,000 employee wellbeing members in 1,600 companies.
[normal]16.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]25 million customer journeys annually.
[normal]17.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Revenues from Wellbeing services grew from £147m in 2009, to £194m in 2012, and now represent 30%
[normal] of the charity’s revenues.
[normal]18.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Nuffield Health Bond, launched May 2013, is a five-year fixed-term product, offering a fixed annual return of 6% (gross) in cash, for investments of £1,000 - £250,000. Our initial aim, to raise £15m, was reached early due to a phenomenal response that 
[normal]resulted in the Bond being over-subscribed - a gratifying endorsement of the Nuffield Health proposition in a depressed bond market. Ultimately the Bond raised £18m to help us make a real difference to the future of healthcare. 
[normal]19.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Nuffield Health has the bes
[normal]t balance sheet in the private health sector (compared to gym or private hospital operators). We are the least leveraged businesses in the industry and our debt represents less than 25% of our overall value. Alexander Harrison, Director Strategic Debt Fina
[normal]nce, Barclays Commercial Bank, 2008: “Nuffield Health has a very strong balance sheet with a low ratio of debt relative to the sector, further reinforcing their market position.”
[normal]20.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]13% of revenue comes from products and services that cost less than £1 a day.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Hospitals and medical [bold]centres[bold]21.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Response through innovation is key to our culture. We identify the needs of our patients and consumers, 
[normal]analyse
[normal] healthcare trends, and then act on them. We are defined by dynamism.
[normal] 
[normal]22.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our strong, consistent leadership, married
[normal] to meticulous medical and nursing procedures, and the outstanding quality of our staff, helps us to achieve industry-leading standards.
[normal]23.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As a charity we also have a valuable role to play within the hospital sector as a guardian of reasonable pricing. Effec
[normal]tively, we act as a safeguard on for–profit hospital groups, whose need to satisfy shareholders can cause an escalation in costs to the health consumer.

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Fitness and wellbei[bold]ng[bold]45.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We are proud to have been a catalyst in the wellbeing revolution that 
[normal]emphasises
[normal] prevention as much as cure. We have acted on this insight and now inform, inspire and enable people to choose lifestyles that are better for their health and wellbeing. Thi
[normal]s is particularly vital in the workplace where so many days are spent. Our workplace employee fitness and wellbeing 
[normal]centres
[normal] allow people to step directly from work into health.
[normal]46.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Preventative healthcare is central to the viability of the UK’s future. It cont
[normal]ributes to containing sector costs, improves productivity and helps people to take control of their health. Our commitment to this concept is 
[normal]realised
[normal] through our investment in fitness and wellbeing 
[normal]centres
[normal], nutritional therapists, health mentors and physi
[normal]otherapists, as well as in leading-edge digital innovations such as our 
[normal]HealthScore
[normal]™ app. 
[normal]47.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Over the past decade we have acquired four major corporate and fitness chains. We transformed and united them under Nuffield Health to create a unique network of pre
[normal]ventative care for the country. This is our vision made tangible to the people we are here to help.

[normal]52.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We establish new standards of health assessment. In addition to traditional areas, we screen for muscular-skeletal problems derived from poor posture in the work environment and anti-oxidant levels that help prevent health risks such as cancer. 
[normal]53.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We innova
[normal]te in evolving ways of caring that best serve our customers, taking the unprecedented step of creating two entirely new kinds of practitioner - the wellbeing physiologist, and the wellbeing advisor - uniquely trained and developed by Nuffield Health. All N

[normal]Personal fitness and wellbeing[bold]57.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our proposition is unique. Everyone who joins our fitness and well

[normal]centres
[normal] receives a clinically-governed Health MOT covering 12 risk areas. This translates into an easily understandable health score, indicating personal levels of health, enabling beneficiaries to address any issues thus taking control of their heal
[normal]th future: the essence of preventative healthcare. Helping people to help themselves is central to meeting the myriad challenges, such as the obesity epidemic, that the UK’s healthcare sector currently faces. We strive to lead that agenda.

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]A decade of raising the bar[bold]67.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Nuffield Health is 
[normal]recognised
[normal] as living its commitment to excellence. Since 2003 we have won
[normal] 
[normal]more major awards than any other comparable competitor
[normal], spanning every area relating to healthcare. During the same period we have gained numerous professional accreditations as benchmarks of the highest levels of care.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Remuneration[bold]68.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Nuffield Health has a Remuneration Committee, comprising trustees of the cha
[normal]rity, which takes independent advice from external advisors. It ensures that senior executives and other employees receive the necessary development and leadership opportunities, and are appropriately motivated and rewarded for their individual and collect
[normal]ive contributions to the 
[normal]organisation’s
[normal] overall performance. 
[normal]69.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]With respect to executive remuneration, the Committee has delegated authority from Nuffield Health’s Board of Governors to determine the remuneration package for all senior executives including 
[normal]the Chief Executive.
[normal]70.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Nuffield Health remuneration package: total compensation, including pension contributions, bonuses and other benefits, is positioned at 75% of the market median (median rate, discounted by 25%) for the reference market. [E.G. if there
[normal] are 11 companies in the comparative market group for a role, and the total compensation level for each company is ranked from lowest to highest, the median level is that of the company positioned in the middle at 6th place. We benchmark at this point and 
[normal]then apply a further 25% discount to determine the level of remuneration].
[normal]71.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Current reference market is a selection of companies based on comparable 
[normal]organisational
[normal] size and complexity. 
[normal]72.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Committee informed of total compensation levels in private and public h
[normal]ealthcare 
[normal]organisations
[normal], and leading charities of a comparable size, to gauge relative positioning of executive packages. 
[normal]73.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our trustees conduct an independent annual review of executive remuneration and view the salaries of our executives as being at the a
[normal]ppropriate level to attract and retain the talent required to sustain the success of the charity. 
[normal]74.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We believe that a charity should be transparent so all of our pay levels are published in our Annual Report and Accounts.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Leadership[bold]75.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The leadership culture 
[normal]established by David 
[normal]Mobbs
[normal], since becoming Group Chief Executive of Nuffield Hospitals in 2003, has sustained the transformation of our charitable mission in all aspects of our operations. Nuffield Health is the result: a dynamic, innovative, responsive ch
[normal]arity, delivering ‘joined-up’ healthcare across society to offer choice and excellence. 
[normal]76.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]On his watch, we have developed the financial strength to enable Nuffield Health to use its not-for-profit status to consider and deliver the long-term needs of the UK
[normal] health consumer. Our ability to innovate in response to the needs of today and the requirements of tomorrow, across numerous fronts, has helped the UK’s healthcare industry to evolve.
[normal]77.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]David 
[normal]Mobbs
[normal]’ catalytic role in our success has been 
[normal]recognised
[normal] by his p
[normal]eers and health commentators. In 2010 he was awarded the highest accolade for outstanding individual contribution to the industry at the annual Health Investor awards. He has been personally ranked within the top ten in the ‘Health Investor Power 50’ since
[normal] its inception.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Conclusion [bold]78.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Nuffield Health’s charitable mission is to 
[normal]maximise
[normal] our positive impact on healthcare and wellbeing in the twenty first century. To service this vision necessitates a leadership team that is committed to the premise of being a unique charity, operating wit
[normal]hin this sector, and which has the experience, strategic awareness and competence to implement and deliver every aspect of ‘joined-up’ healthcare. 
[normal]79.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Nuffield Health’s ability to make a meaningful difference to countless people, from all walks of life, has b
[normal]een greatly enhanced and expanded over the past decade. Our mission continues.
