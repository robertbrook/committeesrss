The challenges faced by the industry back in 2005 are still recalled by many, with\n&#xa0;\naccurate communication and certainty of payment particularly sought after by farmers. \n&#xa0;\nProgress has been made in recent years to rectify the problems of SPS implementation. However, as new policy measures are introduced alongside shifts in delivery (e.g. digital by default), it is essential that changes do not undermine the validation and delivery of payments going forward. \nThe below text elaborates on the issues flagged in the EFRA submission. \n&#xa0;\nCurrently there are no EU Commission implementing rules communicated to member states, yet we are aware DEFRA is now in the process of building their IT solution. Ideally, a new system would not be constructed until it\ns\n requirements are fully known. In practice, the timeframe for implementation and delivery of CAP is tight. It is therefore important that the system is flexible enough to adapt to last-minute changes. \n&#xa0;\nAn increasing number of SPS applications have been undertaken online in the current programme period (currently approximately 55,000). This means that a relevant risk of the new IT system is how\n farmers \nand agents will adapt to any \nchange\ns\n to \nthe \nonline application process\n alongside the new policy measures. A farmer friendly application process is integral to the success of implementing the new CAP. \n&#xa0;\nClearly the next CAP must be delivered by a government department and its agencies that are required to contribute to efficiency savings. As a result, reductions in resource levels may coincide with a change in CAP policy that actually triggers increased demand for support. Online \nresources  offer\n channels for more effective support, and it is critical that the operational knowledge gained through the current CAP is not lost as any resource efficiencies are implemented. \n \nHelp\n with the completion of claims in the first year is\n likely to be\n vital for those seeking assistance.\n&#xa0;\n Delivery bodies need to offer multiple ways of engaging with farmers, road show events\n, etc\n;,\n stakeholders have a key role in facilitating this farmer engagement. \n&#xa0;\nThe\n online approach to applications \nhas many benefits (reduced costs of administration, reduced errors, enhanced checking). However, some \nrural areas \nstill \nfind it difficult to apply online with the current rural broadband provision\n. It remains unlikely that the rural\n broadband situation will be resolved in the next 18 months.\n&#xa0;\nWe must ensure that connectivity restrictions do not make CAP schemes inaccessible.\n&#xa0;\nIn conjunction with the IT systems, it is essential that \nvalidation processes \nare \ntested thoroughly prior to implementation.\n&#xa0;\n \nIn addition, based on previous experience, in-house expertise is preferable to a reliance on \nexternal developers \nto support IT and checking systems o\nnce\n they are\n operating.\n&#xa0;\n \nW\nhole claim validation carried out by as few staff as possible\n would be the preference.\n Task based working \ncreated many challenges\n in the run up to 2005 payments being made.\n&#xa0;\n \nThere remains scope to further\n integrat\ne Pillar 1 and 2 \nvalidation\n. Mapping issues have been well documented in the current programme, so\n factoring in \nappropriate\n resource to deal with the recording of greening is vital. \n&#xa0;\nThis will be required in all its forms and will be required from mid-2014 onwards to ensure that the industry is fully briefed ahead of the expected 2015 changeover of schemes\n, particularly in relation to\n greening.\n&#xa0;\n All potential claimants will need a core base level of clear and user friendly information in 2015 and such information \nwould ideally be provided\n in paper form in the run up \nto the\n first year of the new scheme\n. \nThere is a need to invest in the transition to the new schemes\n, which\n \ncan\n be a platform to build on \nover time, \nin terms of value for money delivery – if farmers understand the new schemes\n from the outset then there are likely to be fewer compliance issues, which \nhelps minimise costs of validation, inspections\n, etc\n.\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAgri\n-environment schemes have been well received by famers, as demonstrated by the uptake. \nYet a\ns the scheme has developed\n, the \ndetail has been refined either to clarify rules or \nratchet up scheme requirements\n.  \nFor example, s\nince 2007 there have been \n3 scheme\n handbooks issued capturing these changes. This has led to different rules applying depending on which date the agreement started.  Going forward there should be a clear ambition to get the scheme rules right from the outset and reduce the number of changes made through the lifespan of the agreements.\n \n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013 \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n              \n \nDefra\n Annual statistics on the value and quantity of overseas trade in food, feed and drink\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/229763/bis-13-775-transposition-guidance-how-to-implement-european-directives-effectively-revised.pdf\n \nhttp://www.nfuonline.com/assets/4815\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/230284/pb14016-cap-reform-direct-payments-20130819.pdf\n https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/229763/bis-13-775-transposition-guidance-how-to-implement-european-directives-effectively-revised.pdf\n"
