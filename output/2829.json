"Written evidence submitted by Southall Black Sisters (LAI 0080) &#xa0;\nSummary&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;About Southall Black Sisters (SBS)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHolding the State to account&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNosheen’s case&#xa0;\nNosheen\n came to the \nUK\n on a spousal visa in 2006 to join her British national husband \nand in-laws \nfollowing an arranged marriage in \nPakistan\n. From the outset of her marriage, she was repeated\nly\n abuse\nd, imprisoned and \nforced to conceive. She \nwas \nforbidden from having contact with her family in \nPakistan\n \nor\n relatives in the \nUK\n.\n She was \nn\not allowed \nto atte\nnd her GP surgery \nunless accompanied by her mother-in-law. \nShe therefore had little opportunity to \nfully \ndisclose her experiences\n of abuse and imprisonment\n \nto outsi\nde agencies. \nH\ner family \nand relatives\n to whom she had disclosed her experiences,\n told her t\no\n ‘adjust’ to her new surroundings and to make her marriage work. \n&#xa0;\nWithin 7 months of her arrival in the \nUK\n, \nNosheen\n was found set alight in her garden. She was taken to hospital \nhaving \nsustained 60% burns. \nNosheen\n was responding well to treatment and at \nt\nhe first opportunity\n she had\n,\n \nshe\n told the hospital that she did not want her husband or in-laws to visit her.\n \nT\nhe hospital did not act on her wishes and instead allowed her husband and in-laws unrestricted and unsupervised access to her. Following one of \ntheir visits, she \nsuffered catastrophic brain injury\n. The\n \noxygen ventilator\n \nto which\n she was connected, inexplicably \nbe\nc\na\nme\n dislodged. As a result of her brain injuries, she is now cortically blind, minimally conscious and needs 24 hour care. Her condition\n is life-long.\n&#xa0;\nIn this condition, the UKBA tried to deport her. She was appointed an official solicitor\n and an immigration lawyer\n \nas she could not give instructions. \nThe decision to deport her was challenged\n on medical grounds\n at an appeal tribunal. C\nonsi\nderable medical evidence was presented to \nshow that \nshe \nwould not \nsurviv\ne\n the plane journey and even if she did, \nshe would not \nreceive the specialised\n medical\n care she needed in Pakistan. She won her appeal.\n&#xa0;\nD\nespite her horrific\n injuries,\n to dat\ne, there \nhas been no effective S\ntate investigation into how she came to suffer serious harm at her home or at the hospital. \nThe police undertook a\n \nvery superficial investigation \nbased on an initial suspicion that she was \nthe \nvictim of an \nhonour crime\n, although they\n failed to warn the hospital authorities about their suspicions. \nFollowing her brain injury, \nthe police suspended all investigations. \nThe hospital too failed to undertake any investigation into how \nNosheen\n came to suffer her brain injury. \nNosheen’s\n father \nhas been left without any explanation as to why there has been \nno state scrutiny to bear on the matter\n. He \nvisits \nNosheen\n on a daily basis\n at \na\n nursing home\n where she resides in a near vegetative state.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;The Residence test  &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“…t\nhe test will not apply to the following categories of case (which broadly relate to an individual’s liberty, or where the individual is particularly vulnerable or where the case relates to the protecti\non of children)...”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Dorothy’s case &#xa0;In November 2008, \nDorothy\n, a Nigerian National, arrived in the UK on a vi\nsitor’s visa\n to join her \nhusband\n,\n a British National\n. \nHer two children were born in the UK.\n Followi\nng the birth of her second child, \nher husband \nbegan to \nabus\ne\n her\n and assault \nher on almost\n daily basis. \nI\nn February 2013, he abandoned her \nand the\n children. This was the second occasion that he had abandoned her \nbut she remained hopeful that he would \nreturn\n.\n After a couple of weeks, \nDorothy\n \nran\n out of money \nand food. She was\n breastfeeding her second child\n at the time\n. She turned to social services f\nor help and they agreed to assist her for 28 days. \nDorothy also\n tried to\n obtain\n immigration advice \nwhen \nshe realised that her husband had done nothing \nto regularise her stay in the UK. He\n had also taken the children’s British passports with him when he lef\nt. \nHowever, as she had no documentation regarding her immigration status, she was unable to resolve her immigration problems within the 28 days. \nAt the end of the 28 day period, social services cut off \nher\n support and accused \nDorothy of not sorting out her\n immigration matter\n. \nThe told her that they would take the children into care. Dorothy\n became homeless. \nShe\n \ninstructed \na \ncommunity care solicitor\n to act for her and \nSBS \nassisted her for a limited period \nthrough our ‘\nNo Recourse Fund\n. This is\n an emergency\n f\nund operated by SBS to help abused, destitute and homeless women with insecure status\n. \nDorothy\n’s solicitor\n \nsuccessfully challenged social services’\n decision on the basis that it was unlawful to terminate support to her and her children\n.\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Mwahasi’ case &#xa0;Mwahasi\n, an Ethiopian National, was forced t\no marry her husband when she was 16 years old. In August 2012, \nMwahasi\n joined her husband in the \nUK\n on a ‘post-flight’ spouse visa. This means that she \ncould \napply for settled status at a later date. Within a few days of her arrival in the \nUK\n, \nshe was subj\nected to repeated domestic and sexual violence by her husband\n. He\n \ntook \nher\n earnings and often \nthreatened to send her back to Ethiopia\n.\n  \n&#xa0;\nMwahasi\n felt trapped in her marriage and started self- harming. She \nfeared \nreturning to \nEthiopia\n as a disgraced woman\n.\n By February 2013, \nMwahasi’s\n husband’s behaviour deteriorated to such an extent that she had no choice but to call the police. \nShe was taken to \na night shelter but her immigration status prevented her\n from claiming welfare benefits.\n SBS assisted \nMwahasi\n in\n finding temporary accommodation from a charit\nable\n organisation and in submitting an application for the DDV Concession\n, made on the basis that she had been\n treated by the immigration authorities as a spousal visa applicant. \nHer application \nwas refused. \n&#xa0;\nI\nn April 2013\n,\n \nMwahasi\n’s\n \nimmigration solicitor\n \nchallenge\nd\n the UKBA’s \nrefusal\n by way of judicial review. The case is currently pending at the High Court\n \nwhich has decided that her \ncase\n raises an important public interest matte\nr\n relating to the proper remit of the DDV Concession. In the meantime, she has been given temporary leave to remain by the UKBA, which allows her recourse to public funds. \n&#xa0;\nThe \nL\negal Aid Agency also refused \nMwahasi\n’s\n applicati\non for exceptional case fundin\ng \nto \nmake an application for indefinite leave to remain in the \nUK\n under the DV Rule\n. She was told that \nit would only be granted if there was a successful outcome of the judicial review proceedings\n in respect of\n the DDV Concession. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDetention and legal aid &#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Sudarshan’s case &#xa0;Sudarshan\n, a 57 year old Pakistani National, \nwas detained by the \nUK\n Border Agency\n during an immigration raid in 2007. She\n spent three years in immigration detention during which\n \nshe was \nill treated and \ndenied access to urgent medical treatment. \nShe states that \nimmigration officials\n often\n shouted at her and treated her like an \n‘\nanimal\n’ causing her to\n suffe\nr\n a complete mental \nhealth breakdown. With the assistance of immigration lawyers, she was\n eventually\n able to leave the detention centre and was granted refugee status for five years. She \nbrought a claim\n \nagainst the UK\nBA\n for \nunlawful detention and \nill-treatment experienced dur\ning detention. \nHer claim was settled in September 201 and she was awarded 42,500 in damages. \nHer \ndetention \nand ill \n- \ntreatment has had a \npermanent impact on her \nmental \nhealth\n. She is suffering from chronic post - traumatic stress disorder.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe exceptional funding regime&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nEquality Impact Assessments&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Recommendations for the Committee&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;26 September 2013\n1\n&#xa0;\n SBS’\n R\nesponse (4 June 2013) to ‘Transforming Legal Aid’:  Consultation Paper, \nMinistry of Justice available at SBS.\n&#xa0;\n See for example the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women, \nt\nhe \nConvention on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women  and Domestic Violence signed by the Government in Ju\nne 2012 and \n the Government’s Call to End Violence Against Women and Girls  (2010) and the accompanying Action Plan (2011) \n See \nwww.southallblacksisters.org.uk\n  \n‘Transforming Legal Aid: Next Steps \nAnnex B: Response to Consultation’\n \n \n‘\nGovernment’s legal aid proposals unlawful says legal experts\n’\n Press Release by the Public Law Project (5 June 2013) \nhttp://www.publiclawproject.org.uk/\n \n \n‘Sexual \nabuse\n allegations corroborated at \nYarl’s\n Wood Immigration Centre’\n \n \nhttp://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/sep/21/sexual-abuse-yarls-wood-immigration\n&#xa0;\n See \nhttp://www.publiclawproject.org.uk/documents/exceptional_funding_blog.pdf\n \n See \n‘\nConcluding observations on the seventh periodic report of the United Kingdom of Grea\nt Britain and Northern Ireland\n*\n \nCommittee, fifty-fifth\n session\n (8-26 July 2013). \n CEDAW/C/GBR/CO/7\n&#xa0;\n"
