defaultAbout usdefault&#xa0;
default1.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Centre for Crime and Justice Studies 
default(hereafter ‘the Centre’) 
defaultwas founded in 1931. We advance public understanding of crime, criminal justice and social harm. We are independent and non-partisan, though motivated by our values. We stand with those most vulnerable to social harm. We believe that the United Kingdom’s over reliance on policing, prosecution and punishment is socially harmful, economically wasteful, and prevents us from tackling the complex problems our society faces in a sustainable, socially just manner.
default&#xa0;
default1.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThrough our various events we bring people together to share ideas and develop solutions. In partnership with Oxford University Press and an independent international editorial board we publish the 
defaultBritish Journal of Criminology
default, one of the world’s top criminology journals. In partnership with Taylor and Francis and an 
defaultindependent 
defaulteditorial advisory board we publish 
defaultCriminal Justice Matters
default, a 
defaultquarterly magazine covering contemporary developments relating to political debate, policy and research. 
defaultOur annual publication
default 
defaultUK Justice Policy Review
default 
defaultreviews criminal justice and welfare policy across the four nations of the United Kingdom.
default 
defaultWe also produce a range of other 
defaultreports draw

defaultSummarydefault&#xa0;
default2.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThis submission addresses two areas of interest the Committee highlighted in its call for evidence: the impact of recent spending reductions and the contribution of existing criminal justice policies to crime reduction.
default&#xa0;
default2.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultOn the first of these, the Centre believes that there is considerable scope for a reduction in criminal justice spending, if this reduction is complemented by a comparable reduction in the size and scope of the criminal justice agencies affected.
default&#xa0;
default2.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultOn the second of these, there is significant research evidence indicating that levels of victimisation are related to underlying social arrangements, rather than to the interventions of criminal justice agencies.
default&#xa0;
default2.4.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn essence, the question of the rates of harm and victimisation in society and the question of the size,
default scope, 
defaultreach 
defaultand operation 
defaultof 
defaultthe different parts of the 
defaultcriminal justice system 
defaultneed to be separated.
default&#xa0;
default3.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultImpact of recent spending reductionsdefault&#xa0;
default3.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThere is considerable scope to reduce criminal justice spending if complemented by reductions in the size and scope of criminal justice agencies.
default&#xa0;
default3.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultCurrent criminal justice spending reductions are being implemented following previous, and generous, real terms spending increases
default, as the Centre’s 
defaultthree reviews of government spending on the police (5); the prison and probation services (6); and the Crown Court and magistrates’ courts (4) between 1999
default and 2009
default make 
defaultclear
default. Spending on the police in England and Wales gr
defaultew
default in real terms by 50 percent 
defaultbetween 1999 and 2009
default. In the case of the Prison and Probation Services 
defaultthere was
default a real terms 
defaultspending 
defaultgrowth of 36 percent between 2004 and 2009. Expenditure on magistrates’ courts 
defaultgrew in
default 
defaultreal terms by 17 per cent from 1998/1999 to 2003/2004 and by 31 per cent from 2005/2006 to 2008/2009. Expenditure on the Crown Court Crown Court increased by 10 per cent in real terms from 2005/2006 to 2008.
default&#xa0;
default3.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe
defaultse
default generous spending 
defaultincreases
default financed growth in these services, though 
defaultthis 
defaultgrowth was uneven. Police numbers grew significantly
default while their caseload as measured by police recorded crime rates stabilised
default. Prison numbers and probation caseloads grew more quickly than budget growth
default, putting significant strain on both services
default. Per prisoner expenditure declined in real terms from 2006. Frontline probation staff numbers declined after 2006 while caseloads grew. Magistrates’ courts’ caseloads and staffing declined from 2006 while Crown C
defaultourt caseloads grew from 2005.
default&#xa0;
default3.4.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe current squeeze on public spending presents an opportunity to resize the various criminal justice agencies in a manner that delivers real social benefit and leaves those services in better shape. This would involve 
defaulta 
defaultgeneral 
defaultdownsizing of the criminal justice system: 
defaultfewer arrests; fewer prosecutions; fewer prisoners; fewer probationers
default;
default fewer criminal justice workers, whether police officers, judges and magistrates, prison and probation officers or others.
default&#xa0;
default3.5.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThere is little evidence of the government embracing this challenge. It appears to favour maintaining the current size of the justice system, or even to expand it in the case of prisons, on shrinking budgets, while chipping away at legal aid in particular as a means of finding savings. The long-term effects of this on staff morale, system effectiveness and justice are difficult to predict, but are likely to be significant.

defaultContribution of existing sentencing, prison and probation policies defaulttodefault the reduction of crimedefault&#xa0;
default4.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Centre’s starting point is that 
defaultthe main influences on 
defaultlevels of harm and victimisation are social arrangements – for example 
defaultrates of
default wealth and poverty, 
defaultlevels of 
defaultemployment and unemployment, unequal power relations – rather than the criminal justice system and its individual agencies. 
defaultOne of
default the clearest demonstration
defaults
default of this comes from an assessment of homicide rates. A 2011 article by William Pridemore in the 
defaultBritish Journal of Criminology
default found that higher levels of homicide were associated with higher rates of poverty
default (8)
default. 
defaultThis is but one contribution to significant research evidence on the links between violence victimisation and social arrangements. Research by Danny Dorling and published by the Centre as part of a collection of articles entitled 
defaultCriminal 
defaultObsessions
default, examined the increase in homicides in Britain between 1979 and 1999 (1). Dorling found that the rising trend in the number of homicides during this twenty year period was very unfairly distributed. Those living in the richest neighbourhoods saw their risk of being a victim of homicide fall. Those living in the poorest neighbourhoods saw their risk of being a victim of homicide go up sixfold.
default&#xa0;
default4.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn co
defaultntrast, evidence for the effect
default of criminal justice interventions on official crime rates is poor. A review of international evidence explaining falls in official crime rates by Graham Farrell and colleagues was published in 2010
default (3)
default. They found no evidence that rates of imprisonment, police numbers or policing strategies could explain falls in crime, apart from some parti
defaultal effects in the United States. To achieve this, the United States has relied on policies of hyperincarceration and 
defaultaggressive policing strategies disproportionately targeting black people and the most economically disadvantaged. 
default&#xa0;
default4.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe lack of evidence for the impact of criminal justice interventions is corroborated by the 
defaultNational Audit Office (NAO) briefing for the Justice Committee, 
defaultComparing International Criminal Justice Systems
default, published in February 2011
default. The NAO
default noted that official crime rates have fallen over recent years across a number of countries. However, it found ‘no 
defaultconsistent correlations’ between official crime rates and the numbers in prison across a range of countries. Prison, it noted ‘is very expensive’ and it questioned ‘aspects of its cost-effectiveness’. 
defaultThe Centre endorses these conclusions and supports the NAO’s position on the ‘
defaultbenefit of conducting more research into prison population trends in other countries in order to learn lessons from those with declining prison populations’.
default&#xa0;
default4.4.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThis does not mean it is not possible to make meaningful intervention
defaults in response to
default victimisation. They do, however, need to be the right one
defaults. For instance, o
defaultur comprehensive review of gun and knife crime strategies 
defaultfor the Children’s Commissioner for England 
defaultcast doubt on the effectiveness of police-led approaches and found that effective strategies typically were 
defaultholistic, engaging with the big questions of disadvantage and social exclusion, as well as addressing individual, familial and neighbourhood problems
default (9)
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.5.
default&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthe Centre’s 2012 report, 
defaultReducing the numbers in custody: looking beyond criminal justice solutions
default, compared a number of countries
default’
default social and economic arrangements and their levels of imprisonment 
defaultand victimisation 
default(7). Countries with lower rates of poverty and inequality and more generous social safety nets were typically safer, had lower rates of violence and lower rates of imprisonment.
default 
defaultIn 2007 the Centre published research by Professor David Downes and Dr Kirsten Hansen on the underlying drivers of prison populations (2). They found a strong correlation between welfare spending and rates of imprisonment. Countries with 
defaultmore 
defaultgenerous welfare provision typically had low
defaulter
default rates of imprisonment. Those with less generous welfare provision typically had higher rates of impris
defaultonment.

defaultCrime reduction policies: a co-ordinated approachdefault&#xa0;
default5.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Centre 
defaultis in favour of a criminal justice system that is responsive to the needs of victims and witness and treats suspects, defendants and convictees with respect and dignity.
default 
default&#xa0;
default5.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe criminal justice system is good at punishing certain individuals and groups. It fails to prevent social problems from arising, or to resolve those that occur. It is possible to deliver lower levels of victimisation and a smaller criminal justice system at the same time. Our current over reliance as a country on criminal justice interventions crowds out more innovative, just and effective policy and practice solutions to the problems our society faces.
