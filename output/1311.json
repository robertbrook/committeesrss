"&#xa0;\nElizabeth J Downing – Written evidence&#xa0;I am a member of the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance and strongly support the request for reclassification of Green Lanes to Restricted Byways which would substantially reduce costs and bureaucracy.  \nDowngrading Byways Open to all Traffic to Restricted Byways which would have little effect but would offer important protection for our damaged lanes.\n  Also the right of appeal against authorities refusing to use a Traffic Regulation Order to protect our lanes when requested by local communities must be a good example of what the government is seeking to support with the Localism Bill.\nI live in the Peak District and walk the green lanes regularly e.g. Brough Lane where, after a lot of time, effort and cost from our local community and our local authorities, I am pleased to see that repair work has been done.  However I am very aware of the fact that the damage to the underlying structure i.e. large boulders and \ncobbling,\n requires rebuilding of the lane.  The damage is the result, not of the many responsible users, but of a few who seem to have no thought for the damage they cause even when asked to be more careful.  I also consider that the remedial work is too high a price to pay for such a few users and is highly unacceptable at this time of austerity.\n&#xa0;\nThese lanes have been used for thousands of years, and only in very recent times has motorised traffic reduced them to their current state.  If there was some way of preventing this wanton damage without restricting use by motorised vehicles I would support it.  Unfortunately experience tells me that temporary measures e.g. repairs and closures for a limited time are very expensive and do not offer long-term protection.  Without protection we risk losing a valuable resource especially for the education and enjoyment of our youngsters.\n&#xa0;\nIncluding the proposed changes would effectively protect some of our most beautiful countryside, reduce the bureaucracy and offer substantial cost savings.\n15 August 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
