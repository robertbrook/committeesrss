"&#xa0;\nAnimal Defenders International submission to the inquiry on keeping primates as pets&#xa0;Animal Defenders International c\nampaigns across the globe on animals in entertainment, providing technical advice to governments, securing progressive animal protection legislation, drafting regulations and rescuing animals in distress. ADI has a worldwide reputation for providing video \nand photographic evidence exposing the behind-the-scenes suffering in industry and supporting this evidence with scientific research on captive wildlife and transport. ADI rescues animals all over the world and educates the public on animals and environmen\ntal issues. We are submitting evidence to this inquiry as we have campaigned for years on the abuse of primates in entertainment, science and as pets and on ending their trafficking. We produced a much cited report in 2006, documenting this abuse and welfa\nre issues arising from captivity, \nMy Mate’s A Primate. \n&#xa0;Executive Summary&#xa0;The extent of the trade and keeping of primates as pets within the UK;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhether the existing regulatory framework and Code of Practice offer adequate protection for the welfare of primates kept as pets&#xa0; and are being applied effectively; &#xa0;5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs previously highlighted, the regulatory framework is completely inadequate, with no \nmonitoring \nof data on trade or ownership, som\ne species of primates not being classified and \nreported \nlow compliance. ADI has identified \nimportant welfare considerations in the lack of regulation in the UK, (8) firstly because the DWAA is primarily designed to protect people and is not concerned with \nanimal welfare and secondly, because standards of welfare cannot be monitored if local authorities do not know of, or are not required to have knowledge of, primates in their constituency. \nCommercial operators \nare required to conform to the standards laid \ndown in the Pet Animals Act 1951. The point at which a person becomes a commercial operator as opposed to someone simply selling the \noccasional offspring of their pet may be ambiguous. Furthermore, anybody or individual may call themselves a sanctuary and \nthus avoid regulation altogether. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhether people should be allowed to keep primates as pets and, if not, how a ban might be implemented.&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;References&#xa0;(1)\n&#xa0; \n  \nHC Deb, 11 August 2011, c1173W, \nhttp://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm2\n0\n1011/cm\nh\nansrd/cm110811/text/110811w0001.htm#11081114003147\n(2)\n&#xa0; \n  \nDEFRA,  (date unknown)Consultation on proposals to use powers under Article 8.2 (EC 338/97)- regulating the keeping of CITES specimens.  Summary of Responses, \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uplo\na\nds/a\nt\ntachment_data/file/205297/fsr13-summ-resp-231305.pdf\n)\n(3)\n&#xa0; \n  \nhttp://www.legislation.gov.uk/uk\np\nga/1976/38\n \n(4)\n&#xa0; \n  \nhttp://www.legislation.gov.u\nk\n/uksi/2007/1437/pdfs/uksi_\n2\n0071437_en.pdf\n \n(5)\n&#xa0; \n  \nPrimates as pets: Is there a case for regulation? 2009, RSPCA and Wild Futures, \nhttp://www.wildfutures.org/\nw\np-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2009/09/PrimatePac\nk\n_minusRegulatoryOptions.pdf\n(6)\n&#xa0; \n  \nCode of Practice on the Welfare of Privately Kept Non-Huma\nn\n&#xa0;\nPrimates\n, \nhttp://www.marmosetcare.com/downloads/DE\nF\nRA_Priv\na\ntelyKeptPrimatesCode.pdf\n \n(7)\n&#xa0; \n  \nMy Mate’s a P\nr\nimate\n, Animal Defenders International  \n(8)\n&#xa0; \n  \nNAVS- Parliamentary Briefing: Primates as Pets, \nhttp://www.navs.org.uk\n/\ncampaigns/go.php?\ni\nd=1398\n(9)\n&#xa0; \n  \nEstimate from hobbyists and the pet trade cited in Greenwood, A.G., Cusdin, P.A., &amp; Radford, M.
