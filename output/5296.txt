&#xa0;Written evidence from Greater Manchester Police (CYS0123)&#xa0;&#xa0;We initially hold an interactive walk through presentation that involves a bus and a HGV, which are there to illustrate the dangers of blind spots on these vehicles. We have a their respective driving trainers there to explain how little can be seen from the vehicles and the other issues they have to deal with whilst they’re driving. People are encouraged to sit in the cabs and view it from the drivers’ perspective.&#xa0;&#xa0;On the back of that we have devised a system to deal with cyclists committing offences by issuing Traffic Offence Reports (currently £50 for cycling offences) then rescinding them when they attend a road safety presentation ran by ourselves and Drivesafe. This is means the cyclist pays NO fine, but we feel that issuing the TOR is the only way to get the cyclists to attend the presentations to find out the dangers they are putting themselves in, also to receive information about free cycle training that is provided by a trainer from Transport for Greater Manchester.  We are able to deliver this free of charge as we use the community rooms at a local firestation which are free, Special Constables who find it a useful experience in dealing with people, issuing TOR’s, using PNC also stopping traffic. Any drivers that are seen committing offences are dealt with by issuing a TOR so they can attend the relevant driver improvement scheme at a cost to themselves which currently are £79.50 or £89.00 depending on the course that they attend, if there is no scheme available for the offence the relevant points and fine stand. Only one driver improvement scheme can be attended for each offence in any one 3 year period.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;We have run five phases of enforcement, four of them on Oxford and Wilmslow Road and one in Bolton.&#xa0;Phase 1:  8/11/12/20 February 2013 (Oxford and Wilmslow Road)&#xa0;95 fail to stop red traffic lights35 no lights fitted/illuminated12 cycling on the footpath&#xa0;Total 142   &#xa0;Phase 2: 22/23/24 April 2013 (Oxford and Wilmslow Road)&#xa0;119 fail to stop red traffic lights12 no lights fitted/illuminated18 cycling on the footpath1 contravening PCSO1 summons for careless and inconsiderate cycling &#xa0;Total 151&#xa0;Phase 3: 17/18/19 June 2013(Oxford and Wilmslow Road)&#xa0;100 fail to stop red traffic lights18 cycling on the footpath4 summons for careless and inconsiderate cycling&#xa0;Total 122Grand total 415From the these three phases 347 cyclists attended the presentations&#xa0;Phase 4: 16/17 August (Bolton Victoria Square)&#xa0;38 cycling on footpath/pedestrianised area&#xa0;Total 3826 attended the presentation&#xa0;Phase 5:  9/10 September 2013 (Oxford and Wilmslow Road)&#xa0;64 fail to stop red traffic lights19 cycling on the footpath&#xa0;Total 8371 attended the presentation&#xa0;During the same periods we also dealt with motorists committing offences&#xa0;4 vehicles seized for no insurance1 £200 fixed penalty for no insurance1 summons no driving licence5 vehicles warned under section 59 police reform act1 vehicle seized under section 59 police reform act15 traffic offence reports (TOR) mobile phones3 TOR for stopping pedestrian crossing2 TOR contravene red traffic light3 TOR contravene no entry sign1 TOR contravene keep left bollard1 TOR glass not prescribed2 TOR defective tyres15 TOR fail to wear seatbelt1 TOR defective lights2 summons for defective tyres6 fixed penalties for unnecessary obstruction17 summons for speeding1 TOR carry person in a dangerous manner2 cannabis street warning&#xa0;The final figures so far from approximately 42 hours of enforcement over a 7 month period are:546 cyclists  93 motorists12 cyclists have committed the same offence again and have been issued with another TOR which will have to be paid as only one presentation can be attended.&#xa0;&#xa0;The presentations that we run are constantly evolving as we receive feedback from each one and try and tailor them accordingly, we have had some very positive feedback with a lot of people going away saying that they will consider their actions more now. Steve Owens the cycle trainer plays an integral part in the presentations offering advice on the varying scenarios that we show as part of the power point, giving examples of his experiences as a cyclist and ways of dealing with situations that cyclists find themselves in. At the end we tell people about the free cycle training what it entails and how it can be tailored for individuals.&#xa0;We have done all this to encourage safer cycling, push the free training and give advice to cyclists that have had little or no training, 96% of the people that attend the presentations have had no cycle training many of these being non drivers as well. We have also found that a lot of the cyclists we stop are international and have little or no idea of road traffic law in this country.&#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
