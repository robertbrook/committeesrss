[[[ – Written evidence]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;For many years I have enjoyed walking in the Yorkshire Dales, and I value the tranquillity and beauty of this historic landscape.  However, it is desperately sad to witness the degradation of our historic green lanes by 4x4 vehicles and motorbikes and to endure the frequent encounters of noise pollution and the potential danger that such vehicles pose.  This practice occurs in many areas of our countryside and there is a real possibility that these ancient trackways will be lost for future generations.&#xa0;Therefore, I am asking that when the Parliamentary Committee scrutinise the Deregulation Bill that it includes the following:&#xa0;1. That Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs) and Unclassified County Roads UCERs which are UNSEALED should be re-classified as Restricted Byways and not considered a part of the ordinary roads network.&#xa0;2. Where, through public support a request to impose traffic regulation is then declined by a local authority there should be a right of appeal either to an independent inspector or a magistrate.&#xa0;I also wish to state my support for the formal submissions made by the Green Lanes Environmental Action Group (GLEAM), by the Green Lanes Protection Group (GLPG), by the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance (PDGLA) and by the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance (YDGLA).&#xa0;Thank you in anticipation for considering these vitally important issues.&#xa0;&#xa0;9 September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
