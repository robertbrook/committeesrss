[normal]Written evidence submitted by the Property Care Association[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction  [bold]The Property Care Association (PCA) is an established Trade Association that, in 2012, began working with a number of companies and individuals from the invasive weed control industry. The goal of the group was to establish trade representation and develop criteria that would improve the delivery of services and treatment outcomes for consumers, and provide lending institutions, developers and landowners with access to competent and fully vetted companies and individuals that are able to deal with invasive plants correctly and effectively. This was achieved by providing accreditation to competent contractors and developing industry standards, qualifications, guidance and insurance products that stand scrutiny and deliver consumer confidence. 
[normal]Over the last two years, the PCA invasive weed group has grown and now represents approximately 25 companies. Membership includes most of the largest active and competent commercial invasive weed specialist eradication companies in the UK.  
[normal]Amongst our main objectives is the aim of dispelling many of the unhelpful and misleading reports and misconceptions that surround plants such as Japanese knotweed and provide practical pragmatic information, help and advice so that invasive plants can be controlled correctly and effectively.
