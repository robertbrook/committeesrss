"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the Student Law Think Tank, Northumbria University (CRJ 04)\n&#xa0;\nForeword\n&#xa0;Background1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis document is a response to the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee’s consultation about the role of the judiciary if there were a codified constitution.\n It was produced by Northumbria University’s Student Law Think Tank, which is a School of Law student society. The aim of the Student Law Think Tank is to involve students with policy work and get students’ voices heard across society. \n&#xa0;\nAims2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe aim of this document was for Northumbria University School of Law students to take up the invitation to contribute to the debate about the role of the judiciary if there were a codified constitution.  Whilst some staff \nwere\n involved in helping the proj\nect come to fruition the content of the response is entirely the work of the students.  \n&#xa0;\n3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis Student Law Think Tank decided to focus upon question 3 of the consultation:\n&#xa0;\nIf the UK were to have a codified constitution, what powers should the courts have \nif they held that a piece of legislation was unconstitutional?\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;\nWhat would be the implications of these powers on existing constitutional doctrines, including parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review?\n&#xa0;\nb)\n&#xa0;\nIn the context of question 3, what can we\n learn from the interaction between the UK courts and the European Court of Justice and European Court of Human Rights?\n&#xa0;\nApproach4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe comments below were collected over a series of large group meetings over the course of three weeks in which the contents of the response were questioned and debated.  This document is the work of \n22 students.\n  It takes into account the opinions of all \nof the contributors to the response, and although it has been edited and reformatted, it aims to record both the areas of consensus which were reached as well as reflecting the areas where divergence of opinion emerged. \n&#xa0;\nChapter 1: Summary of Evidence \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe following are the conclusions of the Student Law Think Tank:\n&#xa0;\ni)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Courts should have the two key powers to declare legislation invalid or incompatible allowing for challenge before and after implementation. \nii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThat the senior Courts (specifically High \nCourt and above) would be able to exercise the two powers.\niii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA separate constitutional court was not favoured.\niv)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThat the decisions made in relation to the constitutional validity or compatibility of a piece of legislation would be done by a super majority dec\nision and that only single judgments would be given for clarity. \nv)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThat there would be an effect on existing constitutional doctrines such as parliamentary supremacy.\nvi)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere were distinct advantages from copying and learning from the approaches adopted by th\ne European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights in dealing with and \nmanaging constitutional issues.\n \n&#xa0;\nChapter \n2\n: Response to question 3 \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhen deciding what powers the Courts should have if they held that a piece of legislation was \nunconstitutional, stud\nents of Northumbria University \nfocussed primarily upon two different types of powers:\ni)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDeclaration of invalidity;\nii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDeclaration of incompatibility. \n&#xa0;\n7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThese powers were identified as being the actual powers the Courts should possess when \ndealing with unconstitutional legislation. Below these two powers are discussed on their merits:\nDeclaration of invalidity:  This is the Courts’\n ultimate power in terms of opposing legislation that it deemed to be unconstitutional. A declaration of invali\nd\nity would represent the Court’s\n view that the legislation is for any reason totally incompatible with the UK constitution and that it should therefore be struck down immediately by way of the Court’s judgment. This power echoes the power of the US Supreme \nCourt in declaring law unconstitutional. \nDeclaration of Incompatibility: This is a lesser power, but may be preferable in the bulk of instances. A declaration of incompatibility would be used when the Courts rule that legislation, if enacted (or once enac\nted), would be incompatible with the UK constitution. The Courts could use this power to inform Parliament that a statute should be rectified to ensure that it compatibility with the constitution. \n8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlthough it was debated whether or not the Courts should p\nossess either or both of these powers, it was widely considered that these would be the key powers of a judiciary equipped to deal with a written and codified constitution. \n&#xa0;\n9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Think Tank then moved to discuss when and how the Courts would employ these p\nowers and as such a number of key questions were raised: \n&#xa0;&#xa0;When Would The Above Powers Be Used? 10.\n&#xa0; \nDiscussion centred around two main questions with regards to when the Court would be entitled to exercise the above powers:\n&#xa0;\n11.\n&#xa0; \nClearly each approach has advantages and disadvantages of how they would operate in \npractice,\n however at this point during the discussion a vote was taken by members on which approach was favoured. This vote was taken under the assumption that Courts \nwould be awarded both the power to declare legislation invalid, and the lesser power of declaring law incompatible with the constitution.\n It was favoured by members that a\nllowing the Courts to use the powers \nbefore and after implementation of\n the legislati\non. \n&#xa0;\n12.\n&#xa0; \nIt was decided that the Courts should be allowed to challenge the law prior to implementation, for example by stating during the House of Lords stage, that it is foreseeable that the law could be unconstitutional if raised as part of a claim. Allowin\ng the judiciary to raise any foreseeable issues to Parliament prior to \nimplementation benefits the procedure as a whole as it seeks to maintain clarity in the law. Also the obvious benefit to this approach is that it seeks to prevent challenges in Courts r\nesulting from the proposed law after it has been enacted. If the judiciary are able to comment on the law prior to its implementation then it allows both law makers and the judiciary to exchange views and expertise, which in theory should lead to better qu\nality legislation. \n&#xa0;\n13.\n&#xa0; \nIt was largely agreed that it was essential that the Courts be able to rule legislation either invalid or incompatible with the constitution in conjunction with judgments on an ad-hoc basis. If the Courts were allowed to exercise this \npower in regard to declaring a law invalid, then it was decided that the best route for the judiciary would be that the Court could send the law back to Parliament with notes on its concerns over its constitutionality. It was suggested that the Court\n shoul\nd\n have the power to impose a time limit on parliament in such an instance, during which time the legislation would, in effect, be temporarily invalid. This method was favoured as a principal power for the Courts, in contrast with allowing the Courts to str\nike down l\negislation\n outright. \nWhich Courts/Judges should have the powers to declare legislation incompatible/invalid?14.\n&#xa0; \nThis question resulted from the above discussion. If UK Courts are afforded these powers, which Courts specifically?\nWith regard to the first question above, the following issues were addressed by members:\n15.\n&#xa0; \nFirstly, which Co\nurt(s) would be afforded the powers to decide on constitutional issues? Discussion mainly focused around the issue of whether a separate Constitutional Court would be required or whether the current Court structure would be able to deal with constitutional\n issues. Members took time to examine the hierarchy of Courts in other jurisdictions which include Constitutional Courts such as \nin \nIreland and South Africa, \nhowever a majority of members were in favour of affording powers to only the Senior Courts (High C\nourt and above). One issue raised against this notion was whether the Courts would be able to cope with any increase in caseload brought on by constitutional law actions. Another issue raised was that of established appeal routes and how these would be aff\nected by the introduction of a Constitutional Court. With members initially against the \nintroduction of a separate Constitutional Court it was decided that actions on constitutional matters should be issued initially in the High Court. \n&#xa0;\n16.\n&#xa0; \nThe introduction o\nf a Constitutional Court was not ruled out by members however. It was unanimously agreed that any such Court would have to sit at the same level as the UK Supreme Court in terms of hierarchy, given the powers it would possess. The main points of discussion\n on the necessity for a Constitutional Court were as follows:\n&#xa0;\n17.\n&#xa0; \nA lot of discussion centred on\n what type of judgment should be given by the Court in relation to constitutional issues. The types of judgments discussed ranged from a simple majority or whether a super majority\n \nwould be favoured,\n for example\n mirroring that of the criminal jury system. \nAgain, members thought it best to take a vote to decide which approach is favoured. Due to the inherent importance of constitutional issues, it was held by the majority that a super majority of judgments was the preferred method. Continuity and clarity in \nthe constitution would also be positive aspects of this method.\n&#xa0;\n18.\n&#xa0; \nThe next discussion point was, in a Constitutional Court, how many judges would sit as a panel. Again, by majority, it was held that a panel should mimic that of the Supreme Court; therefore \na panel ranging between 5-9 judges should sit depending upon the importance of the constitutional issue.\n&#xa0;\n19.\n&#xa0; \nFinally, members debated the type of majority req\nuired in a panel judgment when\n the Court has the power to make declarations on the constitutionality \nof legislation. This issue was hotly debated wi\nth many members having different\n views. Those in fav\nour of publishing all the judge\ns\n’\n decisions and judgments believed that it was crucial for the public to be able to read obiter statements and reasoning behi\nnd the decisions. However, it was marginally decided that due to the nature of the constitution as entrenched law, single judgments would be more appropriate as it would maintain the clarity in the law and allow the law to be \nunderstandable and more easily\n applicable in other cases that come before the Courts. It was thought that publishing dissenting judgments in constitutional cases would lead to an increase in actions and appeals.\n&#xa0;\n20.\n&#xa0; \nFollowing this discussion, the majority of members remained unconvinced t\nhat a written and codified UK constitution would necessitate the introduction of a separate Constitutional Court, although the introduction of a separate constitutional division of the High Court was favoured.\n&#xa0;\nChapter \n3\n: Response to question 3a  \n&#xa0;\n21.\n&#xa0; \nMembers predominantly looked at four key constitutional doctrines \nthey\n felt could be affected by the granting of powers to the Courts: \nParliamentary Supremacy:\n22.\n&#xa0; \n‘The principle o\nf Parliamentary sovereignty mean neither more nor less than this, namely that Parliament thus defined has, under the English constitution, the right to make or unmake any law whatever: and, further, that no person or body is recognised by the law of Englan\nd as having a right to override or set aside the legislation of Parliament.’ —\nA.V. Dicey\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution\n&#xa0;\n(1885)\n&#xa0;\n23.\n&#xa0; \nThe conclusion reached in \nrelation to parliamentary supremacy was that \nif the powers discussed above were granted to the C\nourts that the doctrine of supremacy would be \nadversely impacted\n. The main concern in this area was that the power of the Courts to challenge laws created by \nP\na\nrliament would impact upon the traditional doctrine that it is f\nree to create any law it wishes, and that the Courts cannot challenge a parliamentary enactment.\n  It was felt that the impact upon the doctrine would depend heavily upon the exact powers given\n to the Courts to challenge the unconstitutional piece of legislation. If the Courts had the power to effectively declare a piece of legislation completely invalid as discussed above then it was concluded that the impact of this power upon the doctrine wou\nld be quite significant as it would effectively allow the Court to curtail the powers of Parliament in creating laws. It was felt that if the Courts were given the power to simply declare a piece of legislation incompatible and required Parliament to \nchang\ne the unconstitutional piece of law to be compatible with the constitution then this would have less of a direct effect on the doctrine itself. \n&#xa0;\n24.\n&#xa0; \nIt was felt that there was a more fundamental problem in relation \nto parliamentary supremacy beyond\n the impact\n any powers granted to the Courts under a codified constitution would have. The main point raised and set out here was that the creation of a codified constitution itself would have a direct impact upon the doctrine as it is difficult to see how the doctri\nne would continue to exist and be justified when Parliament would be forced to ensure that any laws created by itself fell in line with the constitution which would need to be entrenched to ensure its continued effectiveness and operation. \nA new constituti\nonal settlement would be required, setting out the powers of each of the three branches of the state. \nThe Rule of Law:\n25.\n&#xa0; \nIt was felt and concluded by members that set powers for the Courts in relation to protecting the constitution would help to reinforce the doctrine of the rule of law in that it would more clearly set out the powers of the Courts. One issue that was forese\nen in relation to this doctrine was the status of the constitution in terms of what Dicey referred to as ‘ordinary law’. \nIf there was a codified constitution this would remove the issue of ‘ordinary law’ by creating a hierarchy of laws stemming from the co\nnstitution. This would enforce Lord Bingham’s view that law \nmust be accessible and so far as possible intelligible, clear and predictable\n.\nSeparation of Powers:\n26.\n&#xa0; \nAgain it was felt that any further powers given to the Courts to challenge any unconstitutional\n legislation would help to further protect the doctrine of the separation of powers. In conclusion it was decided that any further clarification of the powers of the legislature, government and the judiciary helped to further the doctrine and ensure that t\nhe power\ns possessed by the 3 branches w\nere set out more clearly and effectively. Furthermore it was noted by members that affording more power to the judiciary may \nresult in a better\n balance to a system of checks and balances which is heavily weighted towa\nrds the legislature \nand the executive currently. \nJudicial \nR\neview:\n27.\n&#xa0; \nIn relation to judicial review it was concluded that the doctrine would not be seriously affected by any powers given to the Courts in relation to challenging unconstitutional legislation. \nIt was felt that there should be no reason why the powers of the Court in relation to a codified constitution should not allow Courts \nto deal with unconstitutional decision making processes of public bodies, hence further increasing the power of the doctri\nne of judicial review. It was mooted that the power to challenge the actual decision rather than the decision making process as is currently the case under judicial review could simply be the next organic evolution of the doctrine, especially when one cons\niders the European \nCourt of Human Rights’\n approach of increasing judicial scrutiny of public bodies.\n \nArticle 13 ECHR\n requires that n\national legal systems must provide an effective remedy for breach of Convention rights\n in that the \nEuropean Court \nhas found \n(several times) that judicial review \nmay not be an effective remedy because cannot investigate merits\n. As such it was felt that a new basis for judicial review could be created similar to the \nincompatibility with convention rights\n basis by having an\n incomp\natibility with the constitution\n basis. \n&#xa0;\nChapter \n4\n: Response to question 3b\n&#xa0;\n28.\n&#xa0; \nThe m\nembers \ndiscussed numerous reference points in this area\n, for example\n,\n single judgments\n \nfrom the European institutions. The following were discussed\n the most:\ni.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf a\n Constitutional Court\n was\n introduced to the UK, \nshould \nspecialist chambers be formed within it to assure judgments remained clear and properly informed?\nii.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf, like in the USA, it was made very difficult to alter the constitution itself, how would the UK cope\n with European directives etc\n.\n and associated timelines?\n&#xa0;\n29.\n&#xa0; \nIt was noted that now might be the best time to codify the UK constitution, given the amount of guidance we have already gained from the European institutions, both on EU law and the law of human ri\nghts. Some members felt that codifying the UK constitution and entrenching it would create the potential for conflict with the European institutions in situations where the UK constitution was itself incompatible with the European Convention on Human Right\ns or EU Law. By definition the content of the constitution would be much more difficult to change than traditional statute law. One suggestion for preventing such problems was to include a system of fast-tracking the concerns of the EU and the Convention w\nhereby changes to the UK constitution necessary to comply with the European institutions could be made much more quickly.\n \nAll other EU countries and members of the Council of Europe have written constitutions and as such there could be much to learn from t\nheir approaches on this issue. \n&#xa0;\n31 October 2013\n&#xa0;\nAppendix: Contributors\nStaff SupportClaire McCann\nChristopher Rogers\n&#xa0;Written ByJack McDonald (Board Member)\nTom Duggan (Shadow Board Member)\nAshleigh Metcalfe\n&#xa0;General EditorsPhilip Singleton (Board Member)\nRichard \nGlancey (Staff)\n&#xa0;ContributorsBecky Hayes (Chair)\nAmi Dodd\n&#xa0;\nVictoria Adamson (Shadow Board Member)\n&#xa0;\nEmma Jackson\n&#xa0;\nHolly Vevers (Shadow Board Member)\n&#xa0;\nKerri McCourty\n&#xa0;\nLucy Taylor (Shadow Board Member)\n&#xa0;\nKathryn Bullen\n&#xa0;\nAndrew Thompson (Shadow Board \nMember)\n&#xa0;\nCharlotte Ruffles\n&#xa0;\nBen Lawson\n&#xa0;\nKyle Duggan\n&#xa0;\nRebecca Davidson\n&#xa0;\nNaomi George\n&#xa0;\nKelly Ngan\n&#xa0;\nMolly Fawcus\n&#xa0;\nRadha Sharma\n&#xa0;\nRohan Smith\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
