"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Dr Ian Strangeways (IPC0022)&#xa0;&#xa0;Executive SummaryThe answers to the \nfollowing eight questions \nare based on my experience of working in meteorology and \nhydrology for the last 50 years (\nsee ‘My background’\n below\n). I have no ties with the IPCC and no involvement with any coal, oil or gas organisation. My answers are as objective as possible. Questions are in bold font, answers in italics. Questions concerni\nng government policy are not considered; only scientific matters are addressed.\n&#xa0;\nMy background\nI\n was head of Applied Physics at the Institute of Hydrology (now the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology)\n for 25 years, since when I have\n been Director of TerraData Ltd, a consultancy in environmental monitoring. All of this work has concerned the development and use of instruments for measuring the main climatic variables and has involved travel to many remote\n parts of the world where I ha\nve\n witnessed first-hand how the climate is measured under a gr\neat variety of conditions. I am\n currently working on better snowf\nall measurements in\n Antarctica, improved methods of measuring air temperature and investigating how climate model projections of \ntemperature compare w\nith the instrument record. I am\n a Fellow of the Royal Meteor\nological Society (RMetS) and have\n written several books (\nwww.ianstrangeways.org.uk\n) and many articles and papers, as well as giving talks and university lectures\n (the Open University and Newcastle University)\n, \non these interrelated topics. I\n was awarded the \nGordon Manley Weather Prize\n in 2005 \n‘\nfor outstanding contributions to the \nRMetS journal \nWeather\n’\n and the \nVaisala Award\n in 2012 \n‘\nin recognition of my\n work in the field of observation and instrumentation of significant value to the science of meteorology\n’\n.  \nThe questions addressed in this note are very important indeed and being d\nirectly relat\ned to the above work, called\n for a response\n from me\n.\n&#xa0;\nSummary:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
