defaultWritten evidence submitted by Jonathan Coe as Editor of the website 
defaultTelematics.com
default. This submission is reflective of our editorial policy. This submission is for your case study into 'autonomous road vehicles and intelligent transport infrastructure'.
default&#xa0;
defaultI note that you are asking:
defaultI am the editor of a 
defaultnewly-established website
default telematics.com
default which is an independent website developing an editorial policy which seeks to advance all aspects of telematic applications from a public perspective.
defaultSummary
default&#xa0;
default2: 'Telematics data' is any information c
defaultollected by a mobile app or in-vehicle device.
default3: I treat telematics as part of intelligent transport infrastructure and I assume therefore that this submission is within the terms of reference of the inquiry.
defaultProblems for the vehicle builder and equipment
default designers
default4: All British vehicle builders are represented on the
default Automotive Council UK
default (AC). Last year (May 3 2012) it hosted (under sponsorship of the global heavy engineering firm
default 
defaultArup
default) the
default 
defaultIntelligent Mobility Summit
default opened by SoS Department of Business Innovation and Skills Mr Vince Cable MP. This followed the publication (on December 1
default1 2011) of a comprehensive report from the AC which promised big things. As its press release of the time said:
defaultThe “Intelligent Mobility” Report calls for cross industry and government collaboration to enable better mobility through the convergence of int
defaultelligent transport systems.
defaultCongestion costs the UK around £12bn annually. Capacity of existing UK roads could be increased significantly by optimising vehicle movements using existing technology; in some places by as much as three to five times.
defaultThe UK ha
defaults the opportunity to be a worldwide centre of excellence for Intelligent Mobility.
default1. The short-term user benefits (eg entertainment and driver conveni
defaultence) are quite different from the long-term user benefits (eg congestion/pollution management at the national scale). Unfortunately,
default it is not clear that a free-market economy, acting alone, will encourage the transition from the first to the second.default2. 
defaultAssociated with the above, the business drivers for the vehicle OEMs [Original Equipment Manufacturers] are quite different to those for the infrastructure providers and electronic/information communications systems developers.
default But there is no authoritativdefaulte forum in which these independent business interests are brought togetherdefault.
default3. The product development and product life cycles in the different business sectors are quite different (electronics/communications 6-12 months; automotive industry 3-5 years; inf
defaultrastructure provision 5-30 years). This makes it very difficult to coordinate development programmes across the different sector. [
defaultMy emphasisdefault]
default- has the  ‘authoritative forum’ has been created – or the issues resolved in 
defaultother ways? What has government actually done?
default7: The Automotive Council report also says:
default‘...there are several factors which could still act to accelerate the short-term development of new Intelligent Mobility products. These include: Th
defaulte new EU ITS Directive introduced in August 2010, titled the ‘Framework for the Deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems in the Field of Road Transport’(Directive 2010/40/EU). This document puts forward an Action Plan aimed at speeding the deployment of
default ITS 
defaultthroughout Europe with targets and activities detailed in six key action areas. Delivery dates across these action areas run from now until 2014.’
defaultThe DfT is supportive of technologies that improve road safety and have been proved to re
defaultpresent value for money through measuring benefits against the cost of their implementation. The study commissioned in the case of eCall, the UK has not been able to establish a positive benefit to cost case for mandatory deployment.
default&#xa0;
defaultBut ...
defaultFuture plansdefault6.1.2 While a voluntary approach to deployment, (offering consumers a choice) could be acceptable we would only consider implementation if no negative impact on industry or on our existing emergency services was assured. The UK would oppose any proposals f
defaultor the mandatory fitment of eCall to new vehicles.
default&#xa0;
default10: In any case this study has a remarkable deficiency – it has not been subject to, takes no account of and asked for no submission from any representative of the wider public interest in the issues. Yet there a
defaultre big public issues at stake here – road safety, highway planning, vehicle emissions, actual cost of fatal road accidents. These are all clearly stated in the
default 
defaultlatest re
defaultport of eCall progress here
default. (
defaultProgress across the EU of eCall is available on the Hero EU site here
default)
default11: And why such a long time to come to the conclusion to do more-or-less nothing?  In the 
defaultmeantime eCall has been substantially developed. (As above)

defaultwhich part of government is alert to the political dynamics of these changes?
default 1.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default&#xa0;defaultTelematics insurance
default13: Telematics insurance provides a case study of the relationships between technology, commercial provision (in this case 
defaultinsurance, particularly under-25 drivers) product development (devices and their supporting systems and processes) civic rights and the public good. One government department (Department for Transport) and two agencies are involved in aspects of telematics
default insurance (Information Commissioner [ICO],  Financial Conduct Authority [FCA] along with the Association of British Insurers [ABI] and the British Insurance Brokers Association [BIBA]).
default14: Earlier this year the ABI and BIBA with assistance from the ICO a
defaultnd FCA published two guidance documents on telematics for both potential customers and providers. I reviewed them 
defaulthere
default and 
defaulthere
default.
default15: The Department promised a green paper on young driver insurance earlier th
defaultis year – so far nothing has appeared though publication is promised sometime now.
default16: It is outside the scope of this submission to look at insurers' guidance in detail, but they are, in my view, practically worthless. This is because key concepts remain 
defaultundefined – and indeed could not be defined because the definition lies outside the scope of the authors' interests. For example, the ABI is aware that ‘additional data protection issues arise from telematics products’ and usefully, it lists them (I have n
defaultumbered them):
default1. there is more data collected and
default2. consumers need to understand what is being collected and why
default3. without appropriate consent, there is potential for Personal Telematics Data to be collected, processed or disclosed illegally
default4. the exis
defaulttence of additional data, combined with varying outsourcing arrangements, will make responding to subject access requests more complex;
default5. Personal Telematics Data will be an attractive data resource for third parties.
default17: These are good issues – but who i
defaults sorting them out – particularly, who or what is representing the public interest in sorting these issues out? Clearly the implication is that  new legislation is needed to clarify and safeguard personal data and absolutely separate it from the informatio
defaultn which can be used for the general public good (health, welfare, security). The ABI says:
defaultUsing Personal Telematics Data for marketing purposes
defaultPersonal Telematics Data will be valuable to other parties for marketing and research purposes. While it is acc
defaulteptable if data is shared with other parties with the appropriate consent, consumers will lose trust in telematics products if explicit consent is not given before it is shared or if regardless of any consent obtained, the Personal Telematics Data are used
default in a manner or for purposes which go beyond the reasonable expectations of the consumer.
default18: Who is defining what is ‘acceptable’, 'acceptable data sharing’, ‘appropriate consent’ and ‘reasonable expectations’? What is the difference between ‘appropriate 
defaultconsent’ and ‘explicit consent’? How does it become possible for data to be shared ‘regardless of any consent obtained’? Are we talking about government here or some other dark forces? These issues need a clear head. They need drawing out and examining car
defaultefully in a public arena.
default19: Here is an example of what happens is the debate is constrained. The Royal Society for the Protection of Accidents suggested,
default 
defaultin its comprehensive
default report on telematics and black box technology
default, early this year:
default‘… There are issues around data ownership and data portability that need to be clarified. For example, drivers may find it very useful to be able to use the data collected about their driv
defaulting when seeking competitive insurance quotes from a range of different insurance companies. This would be much easier if there were common data standards used across the insurance industry, but at the moment there are no agreed industry standards (except 
defaultfor raw GPS data)’
