defaultWritten evidence submitted by Friends of Radio 3 [FBB0025]default&#xa0;
defaultFriends of Radio 3 (FoR3) is a l
defaultisteners’ group founded in 2003
default with the aim of raising with the BBC issues which concern like-minded Radio 3 listeners. 
defaultWe have a range of interests, including classical music, jazz, world music, drama, arts and discussion, but our
default common interest is in preserving serious specialised a
defaultrts and music 
defaultprogramming
default which we see as core to the BBC’s public service remit.
default 
defaultWe have dealt with BBC management, the Governors and the Trust over 
defaultthe past ten years
default. 
defaultThere are
default 700-800 registered 
defaultFoR3 
defaultsuppor
defaultters. 
defaultW
defaulthen the BBC closed its online Radio 3 
defaultmessageboards in 2010
default for cost-cutting reasons
default we set up The Radio 3 Forum as a replacement for interested members of the public. It currently has just over 1,400 registered members
default, only slightly (approximately 10%) overlapping with the FoR3 supporters
default. 
defaultWe 
defaultinvited
default forum members to contribute and discuss views on the Inquiry 
defaulttopics
default.
defaultWe strongly support the concept of public service broadcasting and the continuance of 
defaultan independent 
defaultBBC as the main provider. 
default&#xa0;defaultSUMMARYdefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultQ1. What defaultshould the BBC be for and what should be the purpose of public service broadcasting?default1.1
default              
defaultThe 
defaultpurpose
default of a public service broadcaster should be to broadcast public service content, as defined by the Royal Charter and Agreement: it should not be formulated i
defaultn terms of specific responsibilities. 
defaultWe note the House of Lords 
defaultCommunications Committee’s 
defaultpublication  ‘
defaultPublic Service Broadcasting: short-term crisis, long-term
default future?
default’
default (2009) which 
defaultoutlined 
defaultvarious 
defaultdefinitions of public service broadcasting 
defaultwhich shared 
defaultcommon 
defaultfeatures
default.
default1.2
default              
defaultA
default definition
default 
defaultgaining support
default, 
defaultthe Committee said,
default was "
defaultcontent
default that the market does not sufficiently provide”
default.
default 
defaultP
defaultossible examples of such
default 
defaultcontent
default 
defaultwould be 
default “national and regional news, current affairs programmes, the arts, children's programming, programmes dealing with religion and other beliefs and UK content". 
default We support that
default interpretation of the core elements which we feel should form
default the basis of the BBC’s public service 
defaultcontent
default.
default 
default1.3
default              
defaultT
defaulthe Committee
default also
default 
defaultstated
default: “
default[N]either Ofcom's nor the BBC's set of objectives is sufficiently discriminating to distinguish between those programmes and services that merit public finance and special 
defaultregulatory treatment and those that do not. Few programmes screened by any UK broadcaster would not satisfy at least one of the objectives.” We suggest alternative objectives (§3.3 below).
default1.4
default              
defaultThe 
default2006
default 
defaultWhite Paper
default 
defaultdifferentiated
default between 
defaultthe
default “worthy”
default and the en
defaulttertaining.
default 
defaultWe accept the point that the “worthy” should not be the sole type of content, but the choice of word is unfortunate (= “all very well in its way, but…”): the 
defaultinformative and educational may well be entertaining, but that is not its primary purpose
default.
default It should be acknowledged that quality and distinctiveness alone do not give  BBC entertainment the right to be publicly funded: if that were the case, much commerci
defaultal entertainment would also merit such funding.    
defaultQ2. How well has the BBC performed in the current Charter period in achieving its mission and public purposes?default2.1
default              
defaultIt is impossible to take an overview of all services but, regarding Radio 3,  it seems to
default us
default,
default as listeners
default,
default that financial cuts have 
defaultbeen disproportionate, to the detriment of some 
defaultquality of content. This may not apply across the board
default where funding has been maintained, or even increased
default. 
default2.2
default              
defaultThe Agreement §7,
default ‘Promoting education and learni
defaultng’, states:
defaultIn developing (and reviewing) the purpose remit for promoting education and learning, the Trust must, amongst other things, seek to ensure that the
default BBC—
default&#xa0;
defaulta) stimulates interest in, and knowledge of, a full range of subjects and issues through 
defaultcontent that is accessible and can encourage either formal or informal
default 
defaultlearning; and
default&#xa0;
defaultb) provides specialist educational content and accompanying material to facilitate learning at all levels and for all ages.
defaultHere, a) and b) above are not 
defaulteither/or
default but 
defaultboth/and
default. If everything is ‘accessible’ to everyone, 
defaultall levelsdefault 
defaultare not catered for.
default The BBC has focused on making programming ‘accessible’, but p
defaulteople who seek to deepen their knowledge of their special areas of interest have not been well catered for. 
defaultTh
defaultis, and the BBC’s indiscriminate use of ‘interactivity’ – inappropriate for specialist services and programmes
default – trivialise content and contribute to the frequently expressed impression that the corporation is ‘dumbing down’ in an attempt to make all prog
defaultrammes appealing to all audiences.
default2.3
default              
defaultThere have been some complaints, which we would support, of BBC services copying commercial rivals,  contrary to §3.1.7 of the 2006 White Paper, and the Charter and Agreement. The Trust has been disinclined to respond
default.
default2.4
default              
defaultFreedom of Information: We have been dissatisfied with the BBC’s operation of its FOI derogation, nominally in respect of ‘journalism, art and literature’, but 
defaultinterpreted as
default anything connected, however loosely, with programm
defaulte making
default and content. The
default dividing line between what was intended to fall
default, legitimately,
default outside the scope of the Act and the public interest 
defaultin 
defaultdisclosure
default 
defaultseems to be a matter of BBC convenience. The appeals procedure is in practice too cumbersome
default to offer a remedy
default. 
default2.5
default              
defaultWe are c
defaultoncerned 
defaultthat, n
defaultotwithstanding the cost-efficiency argument, submission of regular reports and 
defaultaudience satisfaction surveys,
default the outsourcing of BBC Audience Services and 
defaultComplaints to a private agency results in a service too remote from
default the BBC
default to provide satisfactory responses
default.
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ3. Are the public purposes in the current Charter the right ones? How might they change?default              
default3.1
default              
defaultWe prefer the concept of ‘Public Service 
defaultCommitments’
default, the BBC 
defaultproviding
default specified content and services
default, not achieving vag
defaultue, unquantifiable outcomes (“Sustaining citizenship &amp;c”)
default3.2
default              
defaultIn particular, it
default should be 
defaultclear that there is 
defaultno implied 
defaultobligation
default on the BBC to ‘deliver its purposes’ effectively by ‘reaching as many licence fee payers as possible’.
default This becomes a prete
defaultxt
default to focus on 
defaultboosting 
defaultratings 
defaultwhich is not a healthy contribution to the market
default.
default3.3.
default              
defaultWe 
defaultsacrifice the admirable succinctness of the Public Purposes to
default offer these expanded Commitments:
defaulti) To deliver international, national and local news in an accurate,
default balanced and impartial way; to provide informed analysis and a plurality of views to 
defaultpromote
default an intelligent understanding of UK society and world affairs
default, both to UK and world audiences  (through the World Service)
default. 
defaultii) To provide a 
defaultbroad 
defaultrange of mainst
defaultream entertainment, from the UK and the world
default,
default to 
defaultserve
default all ages
default; to provide
default cultural 
defaultand educational programming at all levels, including
default specialised programmes 
defaultaimed at 
defaultextend
defaulting
default tastes and interests, and
default deepen
defaulting
default knowledge
default and appreciation
default. 
defaultiv) To rec
defaultognise and provide for the needs and requirements of a demographically, culturally and geographically diverse public. 
defaultv) To be mindful of the BBC's position in the ecology of UK broadcasting, not competing with what the commercial sector is already 
defaultproviding.
defaultvi) 
defaultTo be a leader in developing and using new technologies and new ways of delivering output for the benefit of the public.
default3.4
default              
defaultService licences should then 
defaultrefine
default the special remits of 
defaulteach service
default.
default&#xa0;defaultQ4. What scope, scale and remit should the defaultBBC have?default4.1 
default              
defaultThe BBC Trust’s introduction to the Director-General’s 2010 Strategy Review asked the Executive where the BBC’s focus and scale could be reduced “if necessary”. 
default4.2
default 
default              
defaultThe Executive response was contained in the section entitled ‘Doing fewer
default things better’
default which recommended prioritising some areas and recommending some 
defaultservice closures (some of whic
defaulth materialised, others did not, demonstrating the difficulty of cutting services which audiences value greatly). It may be that some services, fo
defaultr example Radio 2, can afford to become more focused and specialist at the risk of losing audience (as the Trust implied).
default4.3
default 
default              
defaultThe BBC is almost certainly larger than it needs to be, but this invites the question as to how large the BBC ‘needs to be’ to f
defaultulfil its mission. 
defaultWe would welcome a better balance between the content  areas: information, education and entertainment, both in terms of broadcast hours and of funding (see 5.3 below). 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ5 Should the BBC’s output and services be provided to any greaterdefault or lesser degree for particular audiences?default5.1 
default              
defaultIt appears to be accepted that the BBC should devote the
default largest
default part of its resources to the services and output which appeal to the largest number of people (this has been stated by th
defaulte
default BBC 
defaultTrust 
defaultas
default “to 
defaultpr
defaultotect the services that deliver the greatest value to large parts of the audience
default” – DQF proposals).
default 
default5.2
default              
defaultHowever, that leave
defaults
default many other ‘minority’ audiences – demographic, cultural, ethnic – who enjoy 
defaultthe
default 
defaultmainstream
default output to a 
defaultmuch 
defaultlesser degree
default,
default or possibly not at all. They will prefer content which – for a variety of  reasons – is not considered interesting, relevant or entertaining by the majority of the general public
default. Such audiences should be served adequately.
default5.3
default              
defaultWe think that ‘fair’ and ‘a
defaultppropriate’, having regard to what are considered core elements of public service broadcasting, are preferable to ‘proportionate’. In terms of television spend, 61% for BBC One, 22%  for BBC Two and 2.7% for BBC Four does not seem ‘fair’, ‘appropriate’ or 
defaulteven ‘proportionate’ for a public service broadcaster. BBC radio 
defaultfunding is
default similar
defaultly discrepant
default, the service
default 
defaultlicence spend of Radio 3 (
defaultthe only one of the five network stations to have
default no digital only ‘sister’ station) being the lowest of the BBC network 
defaultstations
default, to cover what is arguably the most varied and expensive remit in terms of specialist musics and speech/arts programmes
default.
default5.4
default              
defaultWe object to the crude 
defaultdemographic
default argument that ‘older listeners’ are overserved or at least adequately served. 
defaultWe totall
defaulty support special children’s services, but in terms of separate, differentiated services, younger audiences (children and young adults) are, by comparison, well served in terms of both services and funding (CBeebies, CBBC, BBC Three, Radio 1, Radio 1Xtra, 
defaultplus to an extent, the Asian Network and 6 Music). Adult audiences are overwhelmingly treated as ‘general audiences’ and anything ‘new’ or ‘serious’ is treated at an intellectually elementary (‘accessible’) level e.g. Radio 3 is more concerned to introduce
default new listeners to classical music than to cater for its existing music audience.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ6 What balance should be struck in what the BBC produces in-house, commissions externally and leaves entirely to others to provide?default6.1
default              
defaultQuality, value for money and creative
default opportunities are clearly considerations but this is not of immediate relevance to audiences. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultQ7. How have the BBC’s commercial activities during the current Charter fitted with the BBC’s public purposes and have they achieved an adequate return for defaultlicence fee payers? What should be the aims, scope and scale of such activities beyond 2016?default7.1
default              
defaultIt seems right that programmes which have been paid for by the licence fee payer should be marketed commercially in such a way as to provide a return which can
default be reinvested to fund further programming.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultQ.8  What role should the BBC play in developing technology and new ways of delivering output?default8.1
default              
defaultThe BBC has traditionally played a leading role in developing new technologies. We believe it to be in the 
defaultlicence fee payers’ interests that this should continue, delivering new opportunities to enjoy BBC content.
default8.2
default              
defaultThe BBC should stay at the forefront and maintain an understanding of the possibilities that are being developed elsewhere.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ 9. How should thedefault BBC be funded beyond 2016?default9.1
default              
defaultWe discussed four main possibilities: a) advertising
default revenue  
defaultb) subscription  
default   
defaultc)  TV licence fee  d) general taxation
default9.2
default              
defaultAdvertising was rejected for three reasons. Firstly, audiences appreciate a service without advert
defaultising and already complain about the amount of BBC on-air promotion. Secondly, the commercial imperatives of advertising would inevitably increase the pressure on programme makers always to appeal to the largest possible a
defaultudience, something we believe has 
defaultalready become
default detrimental to the BBC’s core public service broadcasting. Thirdly,
default 
defaultwe estimated that the amount of revenue needed to fund the BBC from advertising would begin to approach double the amount of advertising currently 
defaultin evidence
default (
defaultin the region
default of £4
defaultbn
default p.a.
default 
defaultfor television
default). The appearance of a giant such as the BBC 
defaultwould
default have a
default colossal impact on the
default market
default.
default9.3
default              
defaultSubscription was not favoured because the detail 
defaultwas hard to guess:
default 
defaultwhether
default individual service
defaults
default 
defaultwould 
defaultrequ
defaultire a separate subscription, 
defaulthow they might be bundled,  h
defaultow the orchestras and Proms 
defaultwould be funded (
defaultif added to a service like Radio 3 that would make it impossibly unattractive to subscribers
default)
default.
default9.4
default              
defaultThe licence fee has served the BBC well over the years but the inescapable fact is 
defaultthat it is an inherently regressive mechanism for raising funds, with the burden falling disproportionately on the poor
default/women
default who bear the brunt of 
defaultprosecutions,
default fines and ultimately imprisonment if they cannot pay the fines.
default9.5
default              
defaultOne considered benefit of the licence fee has been the link between the fee  paid and programmes watched, but this becomes a disadvantage as people increasingly use subscription services or commercial services only. The fee they pay is 
defaulttherefore 
defaultlinked to 
defaultBBC services which they do not use.
default9.6
default              
defaultFunding the BBC from general taxation has appeal: it is fair because
default it is
default  income-related; the mechanism for calculating and collecting the tax from individuals already exists; it avoids the need for – and expense o
defaultf – TV Licensing
default and its related responsibilities
default. 
default&#xa0;defaultQ10  Is there a case for distributing funding for public service content more widely beyond the BBC?default10.1
default              
defaultYes. Public service content should be considered a 
defaultvaluable
default ‘public good’
default, but it is expensive
default an
defaultd 
defaultshould 
defaultreceive public funding.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ11 What comparisons can be made with the provision of public service content in other countries?default11.1
default              
defaultComparisons as regards standards and range of content will depend on what is being compared. However, with overseas rad
defaultio services now available online these are being 
defaultincreasingly
default accessed via the internet by Radio 3 
defaultmusic 
defaultlisteners
default who feel the BBC no longer serves their requirements
default. 
default11.2
default              
defaultDiscussions on our public forum indicate that listeners are keen to recommend and
default to hear of recommended se
defaultrvices.
defaultQ12default              defaultHow should the BBC be governed, regulated and held accountable beyond 2016?default12.1
default              
defaultThe last government’s new model for the governance of the BBC  has been in operation for less than seven years. The Charter put in place 
defaulta new framework by which the BBC, especially the BBC Executive, could be held to account in the interests of the licence fee payer, the BBC Trust being the sovereign body charged with protecting the interests of the public.
default12.2
default              
defaultOur own experience relates 
defaultmost closely to the way in which the new system of service licences and reviews (remits, content and editorial direction of the individual services) has been overseen by the Trust. 
default12.3
default              
defaultThe Trust issues the service licences; approves update
defaults, carries out 
defaultservice reviews and
default public consultations
default,
default and approves management strategies. 
defaultAt present the Trust seems both too remote to have sufficient knowledge and competence, and therefore too reliant on information from
default managers
default. That is a flaw of both the system 
defaultand the individuals.
default12.4
default              
defaultT
defaulthere is notionally an official procedure for complaining about a Trust action or decision, 
default but 
defaultin practice this consists of submitting the details to the Director of the Trust
default Unit for an oracular adjudication
default 
defaultwith
default no 
defaulttransparen
defaultt procedure. Lord Grade has
default urged the appointment of a BBC ombudsman, a measure which we 
defaultthink should be investigated.
defaultQ13 defaultIn a constantly evolving communications environment, does a 10-year Royal Charter and Agreement with the Secretary of State, togetherdefault, provide the most appropriate constitutional framework for the BBC?default13.1
default              
defaultIn principle, the Charter and Agreement seem appropriate. Whether ten years is the appropriate length of time might depend how far it is immutable from one 10-year period to the 
defaultnext.
default It is in the interests of the BBC to have time to plan.
default13.2
default              
defaultT
defaulthe Secretary of State
default, for the Government, should also be bound by certain
default undertakings
default. T
defaulthe Agreement allows the Government to make significant changes
default during the life of each Charter
default. Th
defaulte 2006 Agreement, for example, states:
default “For the purposes of the World Service, the Foreign Secretary shall, in each year, pay to the BBC out of money provided by Parliament such sum as the Treasury may authorise.”
default  Yet the funding arrangements 
defaultcould be
default ch
defaultanged in 2010.
default There could also have been a change in the funding for the over-75s’ licence fee.
