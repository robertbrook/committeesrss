Written [bold]e[bold]vidence from Vertex Pharmaceuticals UK[bold] (LTC 50)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Vertex’s product 
[normal]Kal
[normal]ydeco
[normal] (
[normal]ivacaftor
[normal]) 
[normal]is the first in a new class of innovative medicines that treats the underlying causes of 
[normal]cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease affecting approximately 10,000 people in the UK.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Kalydeco has been available to all patients with the G551D mutation in England since 1
[normal]st
[normal] January 2013.
[normal] 
[normal]This has a number of implications for the commissioning and delivery of specialised services for cystic fibrosis
[normal], particularly in relation to NICE’s appraisal process for Highly Specialised Technologies and NHS England’s 
[normal]clinical commissioning policies for higher-cost medicines
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Vertex is a global health sciences company that aims to accelerate the discovery, development, and commercialisation of critical medicines for life-threatening diseases including 
[normal]cystic fibrosis
[normal], hepatitis C, and epilepsy.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In 1998, Vertex established its first global research and development
[normal] 
[normal]site in the 
[normal]UK
[normal]. Researchers at Vertex’s approximately 150-person UK site are focused on discovering new medicines for a variety of cancer types and 
[normal]neuroinflammatory
[normal] diseases.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Cystic fibrosis
[normal] is 
[normal]a genetic disease
[normal] affecting 
[normal]approximately 
[normal]10
[normal],000 people 
[normal]in the UK.
[normal] 
[normal]It is a complex and multi-system disease that causes the internal organs, particularly the lungs and dig
[normal]estive system, to produce thick
[normal] sticky mucus that eventually leads to death from respiratory failure.
[normal] 
[normal]In 2011 t
[normal]he median age at death for 
[normal]cystic fibrosis 
[normal]patients 
[normal]was 26 years
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Cystic fibrosis is also associated with other long-term conditions including 
[normal]diabetes, 
[normal]infertility
[normal],
[normal] and osteoporosis.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]care of 
[normal]children and adults with 
[normal]cystic fibrosis 
[normal]is coordinated by specialised services
[normal] that are directly commissioned by NHS England
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]These specialised services provide 
[normal]care from a multidisciplinary team including specialist doctors, nurses, and allied health professionals.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Vertex’s product 
[normal]Kalydeco 
[normal]received regulatory approval for the 
[normal]treatment of 
[normal]cystic fibrosis
[normal] in patients aged six years and older who have a G551D mutation in the 
[normal]cystic fibrosis
[normal] 
[normal]transmembrane
[normal] conductance regulator (
[normal]CFTR
[normal])
[normal] gene from the European Medicines Agency in July 2012.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In 2011 there were 466 cystic fibrosis patients with a copy of this mutation in UK.
[normal] 
[normal]Due to this small patient population 
[normal]Kalydeco is 
[normal]w
[normal]idely recognised as an ultra-orphan medicine
[normal] 
[normal](i.e. a treatment for a very rare disease).
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Kalydeco
[normal] 
[normal]is the first in a new class of innovative medicines 
[normal]that 
[normal]treats 
[normal]the underlying causes of 
[normal]cystic fibrosis
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The results of clinical trials indicate that treatment with Kalydeco could lead to a 10-year increase in life-expectancy and a significant improvement in quality of life.
[normal] 
[normal]4.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Kalydeco
[normal] 
[normal]has been 
[normal]available to all patients with the 
[normal]G551D mutation in England since 1
[normal]st
[normal] January 2013 following a commissioning decision made by the Clinical Priorities Advisory Group.
[normal] 
[normal]Since 1
[normal]st
[normal] April 2013 it has been commissioned on a national basis by NHS England.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]UK clinicians have noted that Kalydeco 
[normal]‘is life changing for the few patients with cystic fibrosis for whom it is indicated’ and, as the first medicine of its kind, 
[normal]‘has the potential to transform cystic fibrosis
[normal] care’
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]his 
[normal]transformation in cystic fibrosis care 
[normal]may require 
[normal]changes to the way that specialised services and treatments for the disease are commissioned and delivered.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]National Institute for Health and Care Excellence[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) assumed responsibility for the appraisal of H
[normal]ighly Specialised Technologies (i.e. 
[normal]ultra-orphan medicines
[normal]) 
[normal]on 1
[normal]st
[normal] April 2013.
[normal] 
[normal]It is essential that NICE’s appraisal process for Highly Specialised Technologi
[normal]es recognises the value of innovative medicines for th
[normal]e treatment of very rare clinical subsets of more common diseases, 
[normal]particularly long-ter
[normal]m conditions for which there is 
[normal]no cure, 
[normal]and takes this into account when making its recommendations.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]NHS England[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Although t
[normal]he majority of medicines for the treatment of cystic fibrosis are funded 
[normal]using 
[normal]the Payment by Results 
[normal]system, 
[normal]certain higher-cost medicines are 
[normal]directly commissioned
[normal] by NHS England.
[normal] 
[normal]It is essential that this direct commissioning continues to ensure 
[normal]cystic fibrosis patients have 
[normal]equitable access to
[normal] highe
[normal]r-cost medicines across England
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I
[normal]f Kalydeco and other innovative new medicine for cystic fibrosis lead to a reduction in 
[normal]exacerbations and 
[normal]hospital admissions, 
[normal]it may 
[normal]be possible to redesign some services to allow patients to receive a larger proportion of their 
[normal]care 
[normal]in the community
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]This would be likely to lead to further improvements to patients’ quality of life and reduce the costs of providing specialist services in a hospital setting.
