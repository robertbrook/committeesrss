"BRC23\nWritten evidence from John O’Reilly&#xa0;\nI would like to offer evidence to the committee about my dealings with the registered bodies concerning Part P and the Electrical Safety Council.\n&#xa0;\nI had been registered with ELECSA for 5 years but have decided this year to \nregister with NAPIT\n.\n&#xa0;\nUpon first hearing of the Part P schemes I was filled with optimism that at last our industry was going to be monitored by a body to weed \nout cowboy electrici\nans and non-\ncompetent contractors who up until then had been producing low quality and sometimes downright dangerous work.\n&#xa0;\nSo far these bodies have done absolutely nothing to push the industry I love any further in the right direction, in fact the total op\nposite has occurred where second rate training providers have developed short courses which give “competence” to a person with only the very basic of theory on electrical installation work and the so called governing bodies such as the NIC and ELECSA accep\nt them as bona fide competent electricians, this is ludicrous.\nIf my wife who is a Nurse went and sat a 2 hour City &amp; Guilds 2382 open book exam and passed as most who sit this exam would because it is too easy, she would be deemed by the NIC and ELECSA to\n be a competent Electrician so long as she had the £500.00 registration fee. \n&#xa0;\nI have come across work carried out by scheme members which in my opinion was dangerous  and so I have approached\n the scheme provider with whom \nthe electrician was registered wi\nth\n,\n only for the scheme provider to tell me that in order for them to act I would firstly have to pay them £799.00 + VAT for them to come and test and inspect the property ?\nThis is stupid, why should I have to pay for them to come and test a property whic\nh has had dangerous electrical work carried out by an electrician who they deemed as competent and who was registered with them. Surely they need to be held responsible for any electrician who is signed up to their scheme.\n&#xa0;\nThe Part P system a\ns it is today\n is just a money spinner for the scheme providers and it is not doing what it was meant to do.\nWe need a system based more along the lines or Gas Safe which is regulated properly and which the consumer understands\n&#xa0;\n22 November 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
