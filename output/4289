[normal] 
[normal]Energy and CO
[normal]2
[normal] 
[normal]targets will not be achieved at lowest cost 
[normal]with the current support 
[normal]programme.
[normal] Government policies to date have concentrated on adding costs to energy 
[normal]in an attempt 
[normal]to drive low carbon innovation
[normal].
[normal] However, the cumulative burden of this cost, coupled with the absence of Government incentives and funding support for 
[normal]innovati
[normal]on in 
[normal]UK manufactur
[normal]ing
[normal], is making the UK 
[normal]less
[normal] attractive
[normal] for investment
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]1.2.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]Persistence with this unbalanced approach to low carbon innovation has the potential to accelerate carbon leakage and drive production
[normal] and jobs 
[normal]that 
[normal]are
[normal] 
[normal]essential 
[normal]to low carbon innovation, 
[normal]abroad.
[normal]1.3.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]Low carbon innovation opportunities exist in industry
[normal] but 
[normal]UK 
[normal]manufacturing requires a certain 
[normal]well-crafted
[normal] 
[normal]green policy 
[normal]agenda that is synergistic with its manufacturing and industrial polic
[normal]ies
[normal] in order to assist
[normal] long term investments.
[normal]1.4.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]For funding 
[normal]of
[normal] low carbon innovation to 
[normal]be successful
[normal], the UK 
[normal]must
[normal] 
[normal]ensure that carbon
[normal],
[normal] production
[normal] and 
[normal]jobs 
[normal]leakage is minimized.
[normal] By supporting low carbon 
[normal]manufacturing industry
[normal] the
[normal] UK 
[normal]Government can achieve the 
[normal]twin 
[normal]benefit to the 
[normal]environment and the economy.
[normal]1.5.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]To date the 
[normal]UK Government 
[normal]low carbon support 
[normal]policy has concentrated on giving power generators certainty so that this sector is able to carry out low risk investment in renewable energy
[normal] via its guaranteed subsidies
[normal]. Industry 
[normal]is not afforded the same privilege and in addition has to bear the pass through cost of the certainty afforded to the power generators.
[normal] 
[normal]Government
[normal] must
[normal] provide
[normal] 
[normal]the same balance of 
[normal]incentives and funding 
[normal]across
[normal] all sectors
[normal] of the economy
[normal].
[normal]1.6.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]S
[normal]ectors like cement and lime where plant lasts around 35-40 years, 
[normal]need
[normal] long term certainty to attract investment. 
[normal]Up to now industry has been a missed
[normal] opportunity for UK Government
[normal]’s
[normal] 
[normal]low carbon benefits
[normal]. Now would be the ideal time to put some of the low 
[normal]carbon innovation underspend to good use in this sector.
[normal]1.7.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]Considerable work is required to make the UK an attractive place to invest. This can only be achieved through
[normal] the
[normal] provision of incentives to attract investment and 
[normal]the 
[normal]minimiz
[normal]ation of
[normal] the cumulative
[normal] burden of climate change and energy policies on industry.

[normal]Introduction[bold]2.1.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]The Mineral Products Association (MPA) is the trade association for the aggregates, asphalt, cement, concrete, dimension stone, lime, mortar and silica sand industries. With the recent addition of The British Precast Concrete Federation (BPCF) and the Brit
[normal]ish Association of Reinforcement (BAR), it has a growing membership of 
[normal]over 
[normal]450 companies and is the sectoral voice for mineral products. MPA membership is made up of the vast majority of independent SME companies throughout the UK, as well as the 9 major 
[normal]international and global companies. It covers 100% of GB cement production, 90% of aggregates production and 95% of asphalt and ready-mixed concrete production and 70% of precast concrete production. Each year the industry supplies £9 billion of materials 
[normal]and services to the £120 billion construction and other sectors. Industry production represents the largest materials flow in the UK economy and is also one of the largest manufacturing sectors
[normal]. 
[normal]2.2.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]This respons
[normal]e relates largely to the MPA Cement and Britis
[normal]h Lime Association activities which are p
[normal]art of the Mineral Products Association.

[normal]Will the Government’s current approach towards low carbon innovation help to achieve the UK’s legally binding targets at the lowest possible cost?[bold]3.1.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]Energy and CO
[normal]2
[normal] 
[normal]targets will not be achieved at lowest cost 
[normal]with the current support programme
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Low carbon innovation 
[normal]opportunities exist in industry but t
[normal]he absence of support for manufacturing make
[normal]s
[normal] the UK 
[normal]less attractive
[normal] 
[normal]for investment
[normal]. 
[normal]The UK Government can achieve the 
[normal]twin
[normal] 
[normal]benefit 
[normal]of growing the economy and enhancing
[normal] the environment 
[normal]if it supports
[normal] low carbon manufacturing industry.
[normal]3.2.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]In 2013 the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) published evidence
[normal] that the UK carbon budgets set in the Climate Change Act are being met by a shift from manufacturing goods in the UK to importing goods manufactured elsewhere
[normal] (carbon leakage)
[normal]. 
[normal]In 
[normal]doing so
[normal],
[normal] t
[normal]he 
[normal]UK is exporting emission responsibilities to other countries 
[normal]rather than 
[normal]contributing to an overall reduction in 
[normal]global emissions.
[normal]3.3.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]The CCC have not quantified production
[normal],
[normal] investment
[normal] and jobs
[normal] leakage
[normal] but
[normal] MPA would expect this to also show a shift from the UK to other countries.
[normal] If the 
[normal]absence of support for manufacturing industries 
[normal]continues to drive invest
[normal]ment
[normal] 
[normal]abroad
[normal] 
[normal]it will be impossible for the UK to innovate 
[normal]as the capital and manufacturing required for growth of a low carbon economy will be exported
[normal]. F
[normal]unding for innovation will
[normal] 
[normal]then 
[normal]no
[normal] longer
[normal] be required
[normal] and the UK will be dependent on the innovations of other countries.
[normal] 
[normal]3.4.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]UK manufacturing requires a certain but well-crafted green policy agenda that is synergistic with its manufacturing and industrial policy in order to assist lo
[normal]ng term investments. 
[normal]For funding 
[normal]of
[normal] low carbon innovation 
[normal]to be successful
[normal], the 
[normal]UK
[normal] 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]need
[normal]s
[normal] to 
[normal]ensure that carbon
[normal],
[normal] production
[normal] and jobs
[normal] 
[normal]leakage 
[normal]is minimized. 
[normal]3.5.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]The renewable energy targets that have been set are going to be difficult to meet. UK Government policy 
[normal]to date 
[normal]has concentrated on giving power generators certainty so that 
[normal]they can
[normal] carry out low risk investment in renewable energy 
[normal]via guaranteed subsidie
[normal]s
[normal] and cost pass-through opportunities
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]3.6.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]ndustry
[normal] is not afforded the same privilege 
[normal]of 
[normal]low risk investment 
[normal]and
[normal] in addition
[normal] 
[normal]is having to bear 
[normal]the 
[normal]ever increasing pass through costs from the 
[normal]power generators. 
[normal]MPA has calculated that the indirect cost of energy and climate change policies 
[normal]faced by 
[normal]the cement sector 
[normal]could reach 
[normal]€80m a year by 2020. This 
[normal]significant cost is further reducing the ability for industry to
[normal] invest in 
[normal]low carbon 
[normal]innovation. 
[normal]3.7.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]Recent indications from Government are that domestic consumers will be given relief from green levies and taxes but what has not been made clear is whether this 
[normal]cost 
[normal]will
[normal] be
[normal] 
[normal]loaded 
[normal]onto industrial 
[normal]consumers
[normal]. If this is the case then the cost to cement manu
[normal]facturers will be 
[normal]even 
[normal]greater than €80m a year.
[normal] This is not making the UK 
[normal]an 
[normal]attractive 
[normal]place 
[normal]to locate energy intensive manufacturing industry that is essential for low carbon innovation.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Does the Government have the right balance of focus between [bold]energy efficiency, renewable energy and other low carbon technologies?[bold]4.1.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] T
[normal]he balance between energy efficiency, renewable energy and other low carbon technologies 
[normal]will not
[normal] be right until 
[normal]Government pro
[normal]vides 
[normal]the same balance of 
[normal]incentives and funding across
[normal] all sectors
[normal] of the economy
[normal].
[normal]4.2.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] On 4
[normal]th
[normal] December 
[normal]2013 
[normal]the Government announcements relating to strike prices clearly indicated 
[normal]that the Government is favoring 
[normal]renewable energy technology 
[normal]in the power generation sector. Government has not shown the same intere
[normal]st in supporting specific technologies for industry
[normal]. 
[normal]4.3.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]At the other end of the scale d
[normal]omestic 
[normal]and smaller energy 
[normal]consumers are 
[normal]provided with 
[normal]incentives through schemes like the Renewable Heat Incentive. 
[normal]I
[normal]ndustr
[normal]ial processes
[normal] on the other hand 
[normal]face an ‘all stick and no carrot 
[normal]approach
[normal]’ with less attractive
[normal] one
[normal]-
[normal]off grants as and when they become available. 
[normal]Th
[normal]is
[normal] provides a less attractive industrial investment opportunity
[normal] and results in an imbalance 
[normal]of incentives and funding 
[normal]between the power gene
[normal]ration, domestic and industrial sectors.
[normal] 
[normal]Meanwhile, incentives for the use of biomass by both power generators and domestic
[normal] and smaller
[normal] consumers pushes the cost 
[normal]of biomass 
[normal]up for 
[normal]industrial 
[normal]sectors that
[normal] do not receive incentives. This is only going to result in a shift in the use of biomass from one sector to another rather than a net increase as is required to meet the targets set. 
[normal]Annex I[bold] illustrates this shift as a schematic.
[normal]4.4.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] The Green Investment Ban
[normal]k could have provided industry with funding at low 
[normal]interest 
[normal]rates but 
[normal]i
[normal]t 
[normal]actually 
[normal]provides no additional incentive 
[normal]to invest in renewable energy or low carbon technologies 
[normal]over other bank based loans. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]What outcomes, if any, are the LCICG likely to [bold]achieve? How should its forthcoming strategy drive more investment into low carbon innovation, and how should it measure success?[bold]5.1.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] [bold]The Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) funds expensive technologies for small 
[normal]energy 
[normal]users, while 
[normal]industry, which consumes energy
[normal] on a large scale and more efficiently
[normal] in directly fired operations rather than boilers
[normal], receives no incentive to use biomass.
[normal] 
[normal]A calculation of 
[normal]the cost of installing a technology per tonne of CO
[normal]2
[normal] emissions avoided or alternatively the cost of switching fuel per tonne of CO
[normal]2
[normal] emissions avoided
[normal] will demonstrate if an investment or incentive is a cost effective success
[normal].
[normal]5.2.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] The Government response to the RHI consultation published on 4
[normal]th
[normal] December 
[normal]2013 
[normal]st
[normal]ated
[normal] that the use of biomass for direct heating would not be included in the scheme in this spending 
[normal]review
[normal]. The Government needs to ensure that 
[normal]biomass direct heating 
[normal]is included in revisions to RHI for the next spending review
[normal] period
[normal].
[normal] This will stimulate innovation in industrial sectors, such as
[normal] asphalt,
[normal] cement and 
[normal]lime, which
[normal] use direct heating in their processes. The success of this would be measured in the number of installations switching from fossil fuel use to biomass.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Are [bold]the Government &amp; LCICG targeting investment towards the most effective stages of the innovation process, including over the long-term?[bold]6.1.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]No, 
[normal]investment needs to be targeted across all sectors of the economy and particularly towards industry where there 
[normal]is 
[normal]c
[normal]urrently 
[normal]an absence of support
[normal] 
[normal]f
[normal]or investment in low carbon innovation. 
[normal]6.2.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]In addition, 
[normal]many Government incentives such as RHI are only applicable to new build
[normal]. The maintenance and refurbishment of existing plant could contribute substantially
[normal], and at lower
[normal] cost,
[normal] to Government targets. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal] [bold]7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]What is the impact of the short-term funding timelines on private sector investment?[bold]7.1.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] [bold]S
[normal]ectors like cement and lime 
[normal]which have 
[normal]plant 
[normal]with lifetimes of
[normal] around 35-40 years, 
[normal]need long term certainty in order to attract 
[normal]investment. Short term funding timelines do not provide the certainty required. 
[normal]7.2.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]In the cement sector 60% of direct emissions of carbon dioxide arise from the decomposition of limestone (process emissions). 
[normal]To address its climate change 
[normal]responsibilities 
[normal]the UK cement industry has developed a GHG Strategy for 2050
[normal]. It outlines where Government support is need
[normal]ed
[normal].
[normal] One of the principle technologies will be carbon capture and storage (CCS) which could address both process emissions and combustion emissions fr
[normal]om cement manufacture. 
[normal]Opportunities to develop CCS cannot be achieved on short term funding timelines. 
[normal]The UK should follow the example set by the Norwegian Government by funding a cement industry CCS pilot plant. The Norwegian example is the first of its
[normal] kind and shows that the UK will be behind other countries in its low carbon development if the current absence of industrial low carbon support is not rectified.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]How should DECC ensure that its remaining capital allocation for low carbon innovation will [bold]be spent wisely, after two years of underspend?[bold]8.1.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] [bold]There are plenty of investment opportunities in industry that could make a real and lasting contribution to UK renewable energy and emissions targets. Up to now industry has been a missed opportunity for UK 
[normal]Government. Now would be the ideal time to put some of this underspend to good use in this sector.
[normal]8.2.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]MPA suggests that there should be a sectoral allocation of the low carbon capital allocation.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]9.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]How is the Government maximising opportunities to learn from [bold]and partner with international partners within and beyond the EU?[bold]9.1.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] Currently 
[normal]the UK is not an attractive place to invest and 
[normal]domestic and 
[normal]international companies
[normal] with operations in the UK
[normal] 
[normal]are choosing
[normal] 
[normal]to 
[normal]make 
[normal]investments
[normal] 
[normal]elsewhere
[normal]. The consequences are tha
[normal]t the 
[normal]UK
[normal] 
[normal]may lose the production of essential
[normal] materials like cement and lime to other countries. 
[normal]The subsequent import of products 
[normal]is
[normal] then
[normal] further increasing emissions relating to UK consumption. Considerable work is required to make the UK an attractive place to invest. This can only be achieved 
[normal]through 
[normal]the 
[normal]provision of
[normal] incentives 
[normal]to attract investment
[normal] a
[normal]nd 
[normal]the 
[normal]minimiz
[normal]ation of
[normal] the 
[normal]cumulative
[normal] burden of climate change and energy policies
[normal] on industry
