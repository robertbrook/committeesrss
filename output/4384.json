We note that the Committee has outlined a number of \nareas it wishes to examine. These terms of reference are necessarily wide-ranging in scope given the contex\nt of Charter Review by\n 2016. \n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMany of these areas are not for Ofcom to address. However, given the Committee’s focus on governance and regulation of \nthe BBC beyond 2016, \nthis memorandum is intended\n to provide the Committee with a high level \nover\nview of Ofcom’s\n broadcasting \nduties\n,\n and\n the role for Ofcom and the BBC Trust in relation to the BBC\n. \n \n&#xa0;\n3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOfcom’s role regarding the BBC\n \n&#xa0;\n3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe governance and re\ngulation of the BBC\n,\n and\n the\n roles for Ofcom and the BBC Trust \nwithin this, \nare set by Parliame\nnt in the Communications Act\n and\n in the\n BBC Charter and the BBC Agreement. C\nhanges \nto governance and the regulatory framework are in the first instance a matter \nfor the Secretary of State\n, and \nfor\n Parliament\n to approve. \n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn those areas where Ofcom and the BBC Trust have co-jurisdiction, the two bodies have a good working relationship. \n \n3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe following table sets out at a high level the different functions and \nresponsibilities of the BBC Trust and Ofcom in e\nach of \nthe areas discussed in Section 3\n. \n&#xa0;Role of the BBC TRUSTRole of OFCOMProgramme and output quotasOriginal television production quotasResponsible for BBC compliance.  Must agree quota levels with\n Ofcom.\nThe Trust must secure Ofcom’s agreement to the appropriate level of original productions.Nations and regions television programmingResponsible for BBC compliance.  Must consult Ofcom about quotas.\nThe Trust must secure the agreement of Ofcom before reducing any quotas below the level prevailing in 2002.Nations and regions television productionResponsible for BBC compliance.  Must agree quota levels with Ofcom.\nThe Trust must secure the agreement of Ofcom before reducing any quotas below the level prevailing in 2002.Independent television productionResponsible for BBC compliance with quotas set by Secretary of State.\nAble to direct BBC to make up any shortfall in subsequent years.  Window of creative competitionResponsible for BBC \ncompliance.\nNo role.Radio and online independent productionResponsible for BBC compliance.\nNo role.&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Role of the BBC TRUSTRole of OFCOMOversight of public service broadcastingDelivery of public valueResponsible for ensuring the BBC delivers its\n public purposes.\nAssesses the overall delivery of the public service broadcasting purposes and characteristics by the public service broadcasters taken as a whole, including the BBC.Duties regarding the quality of contentDuty to ensure high-quality BBC\n content.  Service reviews assess the extent to which each BBC service is delivering high-quality content.\nResponsible for maintaining and strengthening public service broadcasting by the public service broadcasters taken as a whole, including the BBC.LicensingOversight of BBC television, radio and online servicesIssues service licenc\nes for the BBC’s public services (television, radio and online).  Each service is reviewed at least five years against the requirements in the service licence.\nIssues broadcast licences for the BBC’s commercial television services (including joint ventures). Does not licence the BBC public services.Compliance with the obligations in these licences is a legal requirement.Editorial GuidelinesThe \nBBC Trust approves Edi\ntorial Guidelines against which the BBC must operate and the Trust judges performance against them.  BBC Editorial Guidelines provide ways in which BBC should meet Ofcom codes.  Also, they explain to producers how they should conduct themselves in creating\n content for programmes.  Guidelines include so\nme things which are forbidden. The \nBBC Trust has sole responsibility for impartiality and accuracy in BBC programmes\n on the BBC’s public services\n.\nOfcom sets the Broadcasting Code for the whole industry. These rules apply to the BBC’s public services, except for matters of impartiality and accuracy.  These rules apply in full to the BBC’s Commercial Services. The Ofcom rules on commercial communications in radio programming and commercial references in television programming also do not apply to the BBC’s UK public services except in the case of rules reflecting European and UK law on product placement in television programmes (which is prohibited on the BBC’s UK public services).Programme complaintsBBC\n Trust can sanction (but not fine): can ask for on-air apology and for disciplinary proceedings against \nstaff member if felt necessary.\nThe public can complain to Ofcom about BBC editorial matters, except in relation to impartiality and accuracy in the case of the BBC’s UK public services.Ofcom does not deal with complaints about commercial communications in radio programming or commercial references in television programming (except product placement) on the BBC’s UK public services.  Ofcom handles complaints about all areas of the Broadcasting Code relating to the BBC’s commercial services. Ofcom can impose statutory sanctions (including fines) on both the BBC’s public and commercial services.  It also has the power to revoke the broadcast licences of the BBC’s commercial services.Programme recordings&#xa0;\nBBC must retain for 90 days and supply copies of programmes to Ofcom, if requested.CompetitionFair and effective competitionResponsible for setting policy on fair trading and competitive impact of the\n BBC’s activities on the wider market.

These obligations originate in the Communications Act 2003 \nand/\nor in European legislation, and Ofcom has a duty to m\nonitor and enforce compliance with these quotas.\n3.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe level of regulatory intervention that Ofcom is required to apply depends on the category of broadcaster – public service broadcasters operate under much tighter regulations than multichannel operators – \ntherefore some quotas apply across the board while othe\nrs are specific to the p\nublic service broadcasters. The latter are set out in more detail below.\n3.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAll television services that Ofcom regulates must be provided under a licence issued by Ofcom.  Under se\nction the Broadcasting Act 1990 it is an offence for any person to provide any “relevant regulated television service” without a licence.\n3.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn terms of licensing and regulation, Ofcom has a direct relationship with\n \nthe Channel 3 licensees (including ITV, STV\n and UTV)\n, Channel 4\n, S4C\n and Channel 5, whose licences carry specific quota compliance obligations\n. Ofcom does not licence the BBC as the BBC is established by Royal \nCharter and the BBC Agreement. \nThe BBC is jointly regulated by the BBC Trust and Ofcom. T\nhe BBC’s Charter and Agreement and the Communications Act make express provision for Ofcom to regulate the content of BBC television and radio services \nin certain areas and also gives \nOfcom the power to fine the BBC in relation to those areas. Services pro\nvided \ncommercially \nby BBC\n Worldwide – as opposed to the BBC public service\n – are licensed by Ofcom and are subject to the full range of standards set out in Ofcom’s Broadcasting Code\n.\nOversight of public service broadcasting\n3.12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA range of broadcasters current\nly provide public service programming. Each year, the \np\nublic service broadcasters are required to submit Statements of Programme Policy\n to Ofcom which explain how they have delivered their public service broadcasting remit in the previous year and how the\ny intend to deliver it in the coming year.\n3.13\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn addition to the industry-wide quota system set out above, the Act also sets out a range of obligations applying only to public service channels. When setting these quotas, Ofcom takes into account the individu\nal remit of each channel and other relevant criteria. These are reviewed as necessary, and the levels may be revised up or down to allow for changes in circumstances and the broadcasting environment. \n3.14\n              \nA summary of the quotas applying to public service\n broadcasting channels is given below. These are applicable to the BBC channels, \nSTV, UTV, \nITV, ITV Breakfast, Channel 4, Channel 5 and S4C in Wales. They do not apply to the commercial \nbroadcasters’ digital services (such as ITV2, CITV, E4, More 4, 5*, 5U\nSA) or to other \nchannels\n. \n&#xa0;\n3.15\n              \nO\nfcom is also required to periodically review the extent to which the public service broadcasting system, taken as \na whole, has delivered the purposes and objectives of public service broadcasting\n. \nOfcom is required to carry out these reviews with a view to maintaining and strengthening public service broadcasting. \nThe\n \nCommunications Act sets the purposes of public service broadcasting:\n(a)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe provision of relevant television services which secure that \nprogrammes dealing with a wide range of subject-matters are made available for viewing;\n(b)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe provision of relevant television services in a manner which (having regard to the days on which they are shown and the times of day at which they are shown) is \nlikely to meet the needs and satisfy the interests of as many different audiences as practicable;\n(c)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe provision of relevant television services which (taken together and having regard to the same matters) are properly balanced, so far as their nature and s\nubject-matters are concerned, for meeting the needs and satisfying the interests of the available audiences; and\n(d)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe provision of relevant television services which (taken together) maintain high general standards with respect to the programmes included in\n them, and\n, in particular with respect to:\n&#xa0;\n3.16\n              \nThe public service broadcasting objectives are\n intended to ensure that programming is provided that, among other things: disseminates information; is educational and entertaining; reflects cultural diversity; covers news and current affairs; provides coverage of sporting events; includes topics such a\ns science and religion; and includes high quality and original programmes for children and young people.\n3.17\n              \nOfco\nm’s Public Service Broadcasting\n Annual Report provides an evidence base for this assessment of the delivery of the public service broadcasting\n purposes and \nobjectives.\n Among other things, our annual report assesses whether the public service broadcasters have met their annual pro\nduction and programming quotas.\nLicensing\n&#xa0;\n3.18\n              \nOfcom regulates Channel 3, Channel 4 and Channel 5 through licence con\nditions intended to promote the fulfilment of the purposes of public service television. Licence commitments are currently focused on meeting public service purposes in a small number of core programming genres regarded by audiences as the most important (\nin particular news and current affairs). \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.19\n              \nIn return, all of the public service broadcasters, including the BBC, receive benefits. These include the right to appropriate prominence on electronic programme guides, as well as access to spectrum that \nenables them to make their services available to 98.5% of the UK population on the digital terrestrial platform.\n&#xa0;\nStandards regulation\n&#xa0;\n3.\n20\n              \nOfcom has a duty to set standards for the content of programmes on television and on radio in order to secure the \nfollowing standar\nds objectives set by Parliament. These apply to the BBC\n and are enforced by Ofcom\n unless otherwise stated:\n&#xa0;\n3.21\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThese standards have to be published in a code, and in setting or revising these standards, Ofcom must take into account considerations such as the degree of harm or offence likely to be caused, the likely size and composition of the potential audience, th\ne likely expectation of the audience and the likelihood of persons who were unaware of the nature of the programmes content being unintentionally exposed to that content. \n3.22\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe publish these standards in the Ofcom Broadcasting Code\n, which sets out the\n rules \nby which broadcasters must abide\n. Ofcom\n also\n has a specific duty under section 107 of the 1996 Act to draw up a fairness code, which gives guidance to broadcasters on the principles and practices to be followed to prevent unjust or unfair treatment in pro\ngrammes and unwarranted infringement of privacy in programmes (or in connection with the obtaining of material included in them). We apply these provisions in Sections 7 (Fairness) and 8 (Privacy) of the Broadcasti\nng Code.\n3.23\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAll \nUK licensed broadcasters\n are \nrequired by the terms of their licences to comply with the Broadcasting Code\n rules\n. Breach of the Broadcasting Code is\n a\n breach of a licence condition and we may take enforceme\nnt action against the licensee.\n3.24\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs noted above, t\nhere are some exceptions to the\nse rules for the BBC. Although it does not hold a licence, the BBC is required by the terms of the BBC Agreement to comply with the provi\nsions of the Broadcasting Code, \nexcept\n on matters\n in relation to\n \ndue impartiality and due accurac\ny\n and elections and re\nferendums which\n are governed by the BBC Trust.\n \n3.25\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the event of a breach of \nthese rules\n, Ofcom has the power to impose statutor\ny sanctions on the broadcaster\n. Ofcom also has the power to \nimpose \nstatutory sanctions on the BBC\n \n(again, under the terms of the \nBBC Agreement)\n.\n3.26\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe imposition of a sanction against a broadcaster is a serious matter. Ofcom\n \nmay, following due process, impose a sanction if we cons\nider that a broadcaster has seri\nously, deliberately, repeatedly, or recklessly breached a licence conditio\nn.\n3.27\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn most cases, the maximum fine for commercial television or radio licensees is £250,000 or 5% of the broadcaster’s \"Qualifying Revenue\", whichever is the greater. For licensed public service broadcasters, the maximum financial penalty payable is 5% of \n\"Qualifying Revenue\". For the BBC or S4C, the maximum financial penalty is £250,000.\n3.28\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe sanctions available to Ofcom against\n the BBC include a decision to:\n&#xa0;\n3.29\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur procedures for how we handle complaints are published publicly\n and set out how we will assess complaints and the timescales in which we will do so.\n3.30\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDuring the last financial year \n, we assessed a total of 16,151\n broadcasting complaints, \nof \nwhich\n 2,832 (17.5%) referred to the BBC. The\nse\n resulted in\n 266 investigations\n, of which 12 (4.5%) were about content broadcast on BBC television and radio services.\n In total, we found 275 breaches of our rules and imposed fines totalling £129,000 for broadcasting complaints and £160,000 worth of fines for video-on-demand services. \nOf the investigations about the BBC’s services, \nOfcom found \n3 \ncases resulted in \na \nbreach of the Broadcasting Code.\n We also assessed 183 complaints about fairness and privacy, of which 46 (25.1%) referred to the BBC. None of the fairness and privacy complai\nnts in relation to the BBC were upheld\n.\nSpectrum\n&#xa0;3.31\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOfcom’s statutory duties include securing the optimal use of the radio spectrum. In practice Ofcom manages and \nauthorises use of\n almost all of the civil radio spectrum (i.e. not those \nfrequencies\n used by t\nhe military or Crown). \n3.32\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe BBC Agreement also places a duty on the BBC Trust to secure the efficient use of the spectrum available to the BBC. All BBC TV and radio services using spectrum in bands \nmanaged\n by Ofcom must hold Wireless Telegraphy Act lic\nence\ns that are issued by Ofcom.\n3.33\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn digital terrestrial TV (DTT) broadcasting, Ofcom works closely with the BBC, the commercial broadcasters and transmission providers to develop detailed TV frequency plans with the aim of securing specific public policy object\nives such as delivering near-universal coverage of public service broadcasting via DTT, as well as providing appropriate spectrum resources for non-public service broadcasting services. DTT frequency planning work is carried out collaboratively by a group \ncomprising all DTT multiplex operators including the BBC. The group is chaired by Ofcom which also retains ultimate responsibility for\n how the spectrum is allocated.\n3.34\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn radio broadcasting, the more diverse range of broadcasters and transmission operators m\neans that the BBC generally develops and manages the allocation of its services within agreed sub-bands or frequency blocks (though in some limited cases commercial and community services make use of frequencies within BBC sub-bands and vice versa), while \nOfcom develops and manages frequency plans for commercial radio broadcasting services. Ofcom does however retain overall responsibility for managing and licensing the use of all of the spectrum used for radio services, \nincluding that used by the BBC.\n3.35\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOfcom\n’s spectrum responsibilities also include securing international frequency co-ordination for terrestrial TV and radio services. International co-ordination rights\n and obligations\n, which \ncover\n the overall spectrum available for the BBC’s services, influence\n the availability and number of terrestrial broadcasting services in the UK. \n3.36\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn contrast to the commercial broadcasters, the BBC’s services are not \nseparately \nlicensed by Ofcom under the Broadcasting Acts (though there are some limited exceptions to this). Broadcasting Act licences are of fixed duration, with statutory criteria setting out the circumstances under which the licences may be renewed. The Broadcasti\nng Act licences issued by Ofcom to the commercial public service broadcasters, multiplex operators and radio services also require adherence \nto certain technical standards.\n3.37\n              \nWhile Ofcom has overall responsibility for resolving interference issues betwe\nen different wireless services, the BBC has a specific responsibility for investigating suspected cases of interference to domestic TV and radio reception. If the BBC determines that a case of reported interference is being caused by a source such as an un\nauthorised radio signal, they may refer the case to Ofcom for further investigation.\nCompetition\n&#xa0;\n3.38\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOfcom has a number of roles and duties relating to competition, which broadly \nconsist of \nenfo\nrcement of competition law,\n sector regulatory duties concerning Broadcasting Act licences\n, and\n specific duties in relation to advising the BBC Trust.\nCompetition Law\n3.39\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOfcom undertakes competition law investigations \nin the communications sector \nunder two parallel provisions, the Compe\ntition Act 1998, and the Treaty for the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which concerns \nissues affecting \ntrade between EU member states. Both provisions describe two broadly similar forms of behaviour that can be subject to investigation under com\npetition law.\n3.40\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe first form of behaviour (prohibited under Chapter I of the Competition Act and Article 101 of the TFEU) is when parties enter into anti-competitive agreements that prevent, restrict or distort competition. One example of such behaviour wo\nuld be the operation of a cartel. \n3.41\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe second form of behaviour (prohibited under Chapter II of the Competition Act and Article 102 of the TFEU) is conduct that amounts to an abuse of a dominant position. Having a dominant position is not against the law i\nn itself, and it is only when this dominant position is abused that we would find a party in breach of \ncompetition law. Examples of an abuse of a dominant position include, but are not limited to, excessive pricing, price discrimination, refusal to supply,\n predatory pricing and margin squeeze. \n3.42\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe BBC is subject to both forms of prohibition under competition law.\n3.43\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOfcom also has the power to make market investigation references under the Enterprise Act 2002. Ofcom exercises all these powers concurrently wit\nh the Office of Fair Trading (soon to\n \nbe the Competition and Markets Authority). \nInformation on Ofcom’s approach to competition law inve\nstigations can be found in our enforcement g\nuidelines\n.\nBroadcasting Act licences\n3.44\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMany broadcast services require licenc\nes from Ofcom under the Broadcasting Acts 1990 and 1996. Under the Communications Act, Ofcom has powers to impose conditions in those licences to: \na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nensure fair and effective competition in the provision of broadcast services; and\n;\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nensure compliance with a \nCode for practices to be followed in the provision of electronic programme guides. \n&#xa0;\n3.45\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe may also open an investigation into whether or not the relevant licence condition has been breached. Before \nexercising powers under \nlicence condition\ns\n \nin relation to a \ncompetition issue\n we consider whether it would be more appropriate to proceed under the Competition Act.\n3.46\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThese provisions are relevant to the BBC given Broadcasting Act licences held by companies which are either wholly-owned (e.g. BBC Free-to-view Ltd, th\ne licensee for DTT multiplex PSB3) or partially-owned (e.g. Freesat, licensed as a\nn\n EPG provider) by the BBC.\nAdvice to the BBC Trust\n3.47\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe BBC Royal Charter and Agreement, which came into effect on 1 January 2007, provided for the establishment of a new Pub\nlic Value Test regime. The Public Value Test must be applied before a decision can be taken to make any significant change to the BBC’s UK public services, which can include the introduction of a new service or the discontinuation of an existing one. \n3.48\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUnde\nr the new regime, the decision on whether to authorise such a change will be made by the BBC Trust (the Trust), following the application of a Public Value Test. In reaching a decision on a Public Value Test, the Trust must take into account the findings o\nf two separate reviews: \n3.49\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFurthermore, the Trust must undertake assessments of certain of the BBC Executive’s proposals in order to determine when the Public Value Test must be \napplied. The Trust will normally conduct these significance tests on proposals formally submitted by the BBC Executive, but it may also decide at its discretion to apply a significance test to any proposed BBC activity whether formally submitted by the BBC\n Executive or not. Ofcom will provide its view on the potential impact on others to inform the Trust’s decision in respect of its significance tests. In doing so, Ofcom will act as an independent body, and will have regard to its statutory duties. Advice r\neceived from Ofcom as to the potential impact on others of the BBC’s proposals will be taken into account by the Trust as part of its overall test for significance, and will be published. However, the final decision on whether a proposal is significant res\nts only with the BBC Trust.\nPlurality\n \n&#xa0;\n3.50\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs set out above, \nwe are\n required to carry out our functions so as to secure \nthe maintenance of a sufficient plurality of providers of different television and radio services\n. We fulfil this generally through the exe\nrcise of our broadcasting functions but also have \nsome \nspecific powers that are relevant.\nMerger control\n&#xa0;\n3.51\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Secretary of State has powers to intervene in certain mergers in the public interest. One such ground is “the need, in relation to every different\n audience in the United Kingdom\n, for there to be a sufficient plurality of persons with control of the media enterprises serving that audience”. The definition of “media enterprise” excludes the BBC but may include a BBC company.\n3.52\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf the Secretary of State \nintervenes in this way, Ofcom must report on whether it is or may be the case that the merger may be expected to operate against the public interest”. The Secretary of State decides whether or not to refer the merger to the Competition Commission (soon, th\ne C\nompetition and \nM\narkets \nA\nuthority\n) for further review on these grounds.\nCross-m\nedia ownership rules\n3.53\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRules relating to cross-media ownership may also be relevant to plurality. In particular, the “20/20” rule prevents a \nnewspaper group with more than 20% \nof national newspaper share from holding a Channel 3 licence or a stake in a Channel 3 licensee that is greater than 20%\n. Such a person is also prevented from being the “appointed news provider” to a Channel 3 licensee. These rules are enforced by Ofcom in\n effect through the broadcast licensing regime.\nOther roles and duties\n&#xa0;Television a\nccess Services\n&#xa0;\n3.54\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have a duty to publish a Code on Access Services\n for television\n, covering areas such as subtitles, audio description and signing. \nThe BBC is required by \nthe terms of the BBC Agreement to comply with the provisions of this Code.\nIndependent \ntelevision production s\nector – Terms of Trade\n&#xa0;\n3.55\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Communications Act requires public service broadcasters to have in place Codes of Practice for commissioning from inde\npendent producers which have been approved by Ofcom. Ofcom is required to issue guidance to assist public service broadcasters in drawing up their codes.\nAppointments and remuneration\n&#xa0;\n3.56\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOfcom is responsible for appointing the Chair and non-Executive Board m\nembers of Channel 4. \nOfcom\n does not play a role \nin appointments at \nITV or Channel 5, which are commercial organisations\n.\n \nNor does Ofcom have any role in the appointments at the BBC Executive or the BBC Trust\n.\nEqual opportunities\n&#xa0;\n3.57\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOfcom has a duty to requir\ne all broadcasters (except the smallest) to make arrangements to promote equality of opportunity in relation to employment and training.\nEnc. \n[not published]\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n For Channel 4, this duty is wider. Channel 4 Corporation must submit a Statement of Media Content Policy, which covers the delivery of its remit across all of its television and other media services.\n The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has annou\nnced its intention to remove this duty.\n Ofcom is required under the Communications Act to assess delivery of PSB by carrying out a review every five years. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has announced its intention to amend this duty so that a review would only be conducted at the \ndiscretion of the Secretary of State and has put draft legislation to make this amendment before Parliament.   \n \nhttp://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/broadcasting/broad\ncast-codes/broadcast-code/\n. A minor change was also made to Section Six (Elections and Referendums) on 21 March 2013.\n \nhttp://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/\nbroadcasting/guidance/complaints-sanctions/standards/\n \n April 2012 – March 2013\n The number of investigations is proportionally smaller than the number of complaints we receive, as \n Not included in this data is a complaint made on behalf of The Rt H\non the Lord McAlpine of West Green that he was treated unjustly and unfairly in an episode of Newsnight broadcast on 2 November 2012. Ofcom found the BBC in breach of Rule 7.1 of Ofcom’s Broadcasting Code\n which states \nthat b\nroadcasters must avoid unjust or\n unfair treatment of individuals or organisations in programmes\n. \n \nhttp://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/consultations/draft-enforcement-guidelines\n/enforcement-guidelines/\n \n"
