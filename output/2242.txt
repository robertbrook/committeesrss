[[[ participation in PE and school sport]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;In order for its impact to be maximised, the Youth Sport Trust believe it is imperative that schools are given support and direction on how best deploy this new investment, and should be actively encouraged to cooperate and share resources in order to achieve the best possible outcomes for their pupils. We are currently working with a range of government department and agencies to ensure schools get the support and direction they need. &#xa0;In addition, as mentioned above, recent research that many primary-age girls are not undertaking sufficient amounts of physical activity. The Youth Sport Trust therefore believes that primary schools should be encouraged to ensure their PE and school sport provision engages girls effectively and, crucially, that girl’s participation in both is valued to the same extent as boys. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;The Youth Sport Trust therefore believes that it is imperative that schools are encouraged and supported to offer a diverse range of sporting activities that appeal to all groups of girls, and offer them desirable participation experiences. The manner in which PE is delivered also needs to be catered to girls’ preferences. &#xa0;We believe that the programme of study for PE contained within the National Curriculum should outline the need for schools to offer a wide range of sporting activities. We are therefore concerned that the recently published final draft of the revised National Curriculum contains reference to named sports (such as hockey, netball or football). The Youth Sport Trust believes these references could encourage schools to offer only ‘traditional’ sports and thus alienate many of their female pupils, and would welcome their removal from the National Curriculum. &#xa0;&#xa0;Through our research into girls’ attitudes, the Youth Sport Trust has found that many girls do not enjoy sport ‘for sport’s sake’. We believe that one of the keys to making PE and sport a priority for those girls is to ensure that both are relevant to girls’ interests. For example, PE with a clearly articulated purpose such as developing confidence, enhancing body image, improving health or preparing for a set-piece performance or charity fundraising event, is much more likely to engage girls effectively. In this sense these outcomes should not be seen as by-products of PE and school sport, but as planned outcomes of both.  &#xa0;Crucially, the Youth Sport Trust believes that, in order to effectively ‘market’ PE and school sport to all girls, schools need to understand what motivates their female pupils to take part in PE, and to be physically active. &#xa0;As mentioned above, through our Girls PE and Sport Innovation project, the Youth Sport Trust is working with 21 schools around the country to help them better engage 11-14 year old girls in PE and sport, and drive up participation rates. The project provides schools with training, resources and ongoing support to help them review their PE and sport culture and develop innovative practices to ensure they are relevant and attractive to girls. A key part of this process is encouraging schools to establish Girls Leadership and Marketing groups (or GLAMS), made up of a cross-section of female pupils, which establish girls’ motivations, and influence delivery within the school. &#xa0;The Fit for Girls programme, mentioned above and delivered in partnership with 

[[[sport]]]scotland has been highly successful in encouraging PE staff to carry out consultation with their female pupils, with 98.8% of PE staff who have taken part in the programme reporting that they undertook such a consultation. Meanwhile, 60% of PE staff reported that Fit for Girls had helped to increase girls' participation in PE, sport and physical activity. In particular, those who were involved in Fit for Girls noted that it helped to remove barriers to girls taking part in PE and sport and increase their confidence and enthusiasm for the subject.&#xa0;Fit for Girls has started to create a culture change in PE, physical activity and sport engagement for adolescent girls in schools. Building on this learning, Fit for Girls is now offering schools the opportunity to engage with a Fit for Girls trainer in a bespoke 1:1 approach in order to allow discussions and solutions to be individually tailored to meet school needs.  &#xa0;The Youth Sport Trust would welcome direction from government for all secondary schools to consult with their female pupils in this way. &#xa0;&#xa0;In addition the Youth Sport Trust believes that schools should be encouraged to develop their own female sporting role models. With a lack of positive role models in the media, older girls in school can serve as strong role models for younger girls, demonstrating the realistic possibilities of what they can achieve. A crucial element of the Youth Sport Trust’s Girls PE and Innovation project, is that the ‘GLAMS’ mentioned above also act as role models to younger girls and help to ‘sell’ participation in PE and school sport. &#xa0;&#xa0;Research shows that boys are more likely than girls to prefer school sport or physical activity to be competitive. In order to engage all young people, including girls, in competition, it is imperative that sporting formats are fully inclusive, and the wider benefits of taking part are emphasised to young people and school sport practitioners. &#xa0;In addition, while some girls find traditional, confrontational, models of competition off-putting, research shows they are more likely to engage in personal or group challenge activities. The Youth Sport Trust therefore believes that government and practitioners should employ a diverse approach which values different forms of competition equally. &#xa0;&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
