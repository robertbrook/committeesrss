[[[&#xa0;]]]IPCC ignores the cyclic changeS in climate that have been recognized for years.              Just getting the terminology half-way from global warming to climate change took years, but the failure to admit that cooling--the other half of the cycles--has taken place seems beyond them.&#xa0;Fou.r great ice ages were known in Europe, enclosed map from Andersen &amp; Borns 1994, and North America before WWII.              The rate of melting·the ice, a mile thick on Edinburgh, in 18,000 years raisedsea level 400_ feet in that time. most of it in the early few thousand years confirmed with robust 14C dates in the thousands of examples.&#xa0;The marvelously complicated models of climate into the fog of the future don’t fit the record of climateS up and down in the past.&#xa0;My bachelor's degree at Yale was in mathematics.              I receiveda Ph.D. in Geology at Yale in 1960.              IPCC should check the voluminousand robust data on actual climate changeS that actually took place.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;.

Europe, 20 000-17 000 years ago. Most of Europe was covered with tundra (orange) and open steppe or parkland (yellow). The tundra had no or very s parse vege­ tation in a zone adjacent to the ice sheet , and brush/grass vegetation covered much of the southern  (eastern) parts of the tundra.  Steppe or parkland (with patches of forest) covered  much of southern Europe.For the North  Sea area the main map probably shows conditions 22 000-21 000 years ago, and the map in the small  frame probably shows conditions 20 000-18 000 years ago.The extent  of the ice cover on the North  Atlantic  varied,and the maps show the approx­imate winter  pack-ice conditions.&#xa0;
