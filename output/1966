defaultNorth East Chamber of Commerce – Written evidencedefault&#xa0;
defaultThe North East Chamber of Commerce (NECC) welcomes the opportunity to respond to this consultation. NECC is the North East’s leading business membership organisation and one of the largest chambers of commerce in the country. We represent approximately 4,000 businesses located across the region – our members are drawn from businesses of all sizes and sectors, and employ around 30% of the region’s workforce. Our response follows consultation with our members, as well as the British Chambers of Commerce, the national chamber network.

defaultUnnecessary, ill-thought out and overly complex regulation places a considerable burden upon businesses, draining time and resources, and ultimately hindering economic performance. NECC is strongly committed to reducing the burden of regulation, because North East firms consistently cite this as a barrier to business. Accordingly, NECC supports the general direction of the Draft Deregulation Bill, which should reduce regulatory compliance costs for businesses, and incorporate economic accountability and awareness into the regulatory system. However, NECC is concerned that certain proposals remain underdeveloped or require further clarity to ensure businesses gain the utmost benefit from any regulatory changes. NECC therefore makes the following recommendations: 
default&#xa0;
defaultDisapplyingdefault legislation no longer of practical usedefaultNECC supports, in principle, the introduction of a mechanism to allow Parliament to identify and remove outdated and irrelevant legislation more quickly, as this will free businesses from compliance with unnecessary and redundant regulation. However, the Bill does not clarify what this mechanism will be, or how it will operate. For example, will regulation face scrutiny before its 
defaultdisapplication
default, or who will be responsible for identifying irrelevant regulation? Given the modest business response to the Red Tape Challenge, the 
defaultdisapplication
default mechanism needs to be clarified and made visible to businesses to ensure its usefulness as a means of reducing regulatory compliance burdens. 
default&#xa0;
defaultExercise of regulatory functions: economic growth duty defaultNECC welcomes the introduction of a duty to require non-economic regulators to consider the impact of regulation upon economic growth; a growth duty would build economic accountability into the regulatory system. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOur on-going commitment to reducing the regulatory burden faced by business is not simply a matter of reducing the amount of regulation, but also ensuring that future regulation is fit for purpose. Indeed, considered and appropriate regulation can produce economic benefits by supporting the business community, and its functioning. Although NECC views an economic growth duty as a welcome addition, we must also emphasise that 
defaultany
default regulation, even when a growth duty has been considered, must be enforced consistently and clearly. The compliance cost of meeting unnecessary and unclear regulatory standards is highly detrimental to business. Therefore, NECC hopes an economic growth duty will help realise a cooperative and supportive regulatory system aimed at lowering compliance burdens.  
default&#xa0;
defaultHealth and Safety at work defaultNECC supports the Bill’s proposal to exempt from health and safety law self-employed workers, whose activities are low risk, thus posing no potential danger or risk of harm to others or themselves. Many small firms and self-employed workers do not have in-house HR 
defaultdepartments, leading to escalating compliance costs as ad hoc external support is frequently required, often at substantial cost. By exempting self-employed workers from health and safety law, companies and start-ups will benefit from freed up resources – time and capital – which can be refocused on company development. This is particularly significant given the Government’s on-going commitment to encouraging entrepreneurship and supporting new businesses. NECC appreciates efforts to lower the significant regulatory burdens facing small businesses. 
default&#xa0;
defaultEmployment Tribunals: wider recommendations defaultNorth East businesses frequently perceive employment tribunals as unhelpful to businesses, with outcomes often biased in favour of employees. Over the past decade, employment tribunals have more than doubled in incidence, placing considerable strain – financial and emotional – on businesses. Even if a claim is eventually dismissed, the impact upon staff morale is significant, while accompanying legal costs can reach thousands of pounds. NECC welcomed the recent introduction of claimant fees to the employment tribunal process as means of deterring nuisance claims, and supports the continuing reform of the tribunal service. 
default&#xa0;
defaultDisallowing employment tribunals to make wider recommendations in successful discrimination cases under the Equality Act 2010 is essential to encouraging business confidence in the tribunal system and addressing perceptions of bias. Genuinely wronged employees will still have access to justice, but tribunal jurisdiction will be restricted to the case in hand. This is necessary as judges only have access to information related to the case in question, which are predominantly isolated incidents, with companies following their own in-house disciplinary procedures, as well as that of the employment tribunal. Wider recommendations extend the judicial reach of tribunals to an unnecessary and economically disadvantageous degree. NECC supports the Government’s proposal. 
default&#xa0;
defaultApproved apprenticeship standardsdefaultThe proposed changes to apprenticeships, based on the Richard Review of Apprentices, are supported by NECC. Encouraging greater innovation within the delivery of apprenticeships, along with aligning outcomes to an industry standard, will strengthen the relevance of apprenticeships to employer requirements. This will ensure employers continue to view apprenticeships as a viable option by providing the skills young people need to be successful in the workplace. 
default&#xa0;
defaultNevertheless, although NECC supports proposals for the Government to provide a light-touch role in assessing the quality of training organisations to ensure good quality delivery, NECC feels this should be accompanied with supporting mechanisms. NECC’s 
defaultBridging the Gap 
defaultreport addressing a skills gap between employer needs and labour supply, called for a ‘portal’ to identify training organisations and providers. This would provide a valuable addition to the Government’s new apprenticeship ‘regime’ by providing a single source of information for businesses to see what is available, and make informed choices about their apprenticeship and training options – ensuring the long-term viability of apprenticeships to business growth, and wider economic development.
