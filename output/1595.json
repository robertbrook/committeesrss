\nThe \nBuilding &amp; Engineering Services Association is the UK's leading trade association for building services engineering contractors, representing the interests of over 1\n,\n370 firms active in the design, installation, commissioning and maintenance of heating, ventilating, air conditioning, refrigeration and electrical products and equipment.\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nB&amp;ES is taking a lead role in the development of sustainable building services engineering\n.  \nRecent research we have undertaken amongst our members shows that\n:\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe are concerned that system performance should be viewed as a whole rather than concentrating on the primary fuel emissions\n.  \nWhatever analysis structure is implemented it should always centre on minimising the energy use at point of delivery and also the energy consumed in the systems that then deliver the energy.\n1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs buildings become more energy efficient through the application of insulation and control of air infiltration, the energy used in the delivery systems can be as much as 40% of the total energy delivered\n.  \nThis auxiliary energy is invariably electricity with its high CO\n2\n content.\n1.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAgainst this background, we welcome the Energy and Climate Change \nS\nelect \nC\nommittee’s inquiry into Heat and are pleased to submit our response for consideration\n.  We have focussed on space and water heating as the areas most covered by our members, and also which make-up the vast bulk of heat demand.  \nIn compiling this submission, we have consulted with our members by circulating an early draft version which was discussed through an online webinar.\n1.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur submission paper presented last year to the Chartered Institute of Building Services Engineers’ Technical Symposium, resulted from research undertaken for the B&amp;ES \nRenewable Systems Integration Guide\n.  \nThe standards referenced \ntherein make for a quantifiable, audible calculation process applicable to both renewable and traditional energy sources\n.  \nWe appreciate this paper is too lengthy to provide to committee members with this submission\n.  \nHowever\n,\n we \nfeel it is very relevant and would much appreciate the opportunity to give oral evidence to the committee and to discuss it with them then\n.\n2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInquiry questionsWith regard to the specific questions asked, our responses are as follows:\n2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIs the \nGovernment\n taking the right approach to reduce heat energy demand\n?\nJust as people in business or in their homes do not wake up and ask themselves, “\nhow much en\nergy can we  save today\n?”, so they do not value heat until they do not have it\n.  \nTheir main awareness comes when a large utility bill arrives on the doorstep\n.  \nAs the production of heat for space heating is seldom of strategic financial importance to people, it attracts little attention except in those areas where there is a major impact\n,\n eg in buildings such as hospitals and universities\n.  \nThere are few significant drivers for change and almost always competing\n investment opportunities.\nIn \nGovernment\n, responsibility for energy demand falls between \nthree dep\nartments\n:\n(a)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe \nDepartment for Energy and Climate Change  \n(“\nDECC”) \n- \nwhere the Energy Efficiency Deployment Office\n (“\nEEDO”)\n is at the centre of a new drive by \nGovernment\n to improve the way we use energy across the UK)\n(b)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe \nDepartment for Communities and Local Government (\n“\nCLG”\n - responsible for energy standards in buildings)\n(c)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nwhile the \nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (\n“\nDEFRA”\n) has an interest in energy with regard to emissions of CO\n2\n.\nThen, at an operational level, there are \ntwo \nmain non-departmental \ng\novernment\nal bodies\n:\n(a)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe Energy Saving Trust, working mainly in the domestic sector\n,\n and\n(b)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe Carbon Trust, working with industry and innovative energy technologies.\nFinally there is \nOfgem, the energy regulator and responsible for overseeing the introduction of the \nRenewable Heat Incentive (“\nRHI”)\n.  \nThere is no clear lead body with overall responsibility for reducing heat energy demand\n.  \nWith no specific market driver and a lack of \nGovernment\n focus, it is difficult to know how much progress is being achieved, with no clear way of being able to calculate overall costs against carbon emissions and wider sustainability issues\n.  \nGovernment policy is delivered through an over-complex mix of disparate initiatives: building regulations, planning requirements, the code for sustainable homes, renewable heat incentive, the \nCarbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme (\n“\nCRCEES”\n) and Green Deal to name but some\n.  \nThis had led to a ‘tick box’ culture that puts in place minimum requirements at the planning stage, though in effect these requirements are rarely inspected or checked to see if they function \nas designed.\nOverall there is no clear joined up approach; more emphasis needs to be made on improving the heat efficiency of commercial and housing projects, which could be incentivised via the planning system, section 106 agreements and proper enforcement\n.  \nWhat is needed is a results-based process\n,\n rather than a theoretical planning design process\n.\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat progress is the \nGovernment\n making on reducing the demand for heat?\nReduction in demand for heat should not be confused with de-carbonisation.\nThe \nGovernment\n has put in place several initiatives that aim to reduce demand for heat, most significantly the Green Deal / ECO and the \nRHI \n(designed to encourage a switch to renewable technologies, the heat saving element comes from a requirement to carry out the minimum insulation improvements specified in the Green Deal assessment to trigger funding)\n.  \nThe Government has also published revisions to Part L of the Building Regulations\n.  \nSo in principle, some progress is being made\n.  \nHowever, so far the Green Deal has proven disappointing with little take-up by consumers mainly due to a lack of detailed communication and explanation (the budget for digital switchover was \nc\n £146\n million\n, by comparison the budget for Green Deal is £2.9\n million\n), as well as perceived high interest rates and concerns over the impact upon resale values of properties that have had Green Deal funded improvements.\nThe changes to Part L are broadly welcomed though there is a lack of ambition in the new regulations, particularly in relation to the absence of new standards for refurbishments and existing homes, which are responsible for the majority of the UK’s emissions\n.  \nDue to the prevailing economic conditions, many developments which have been granted planning permission under the old regulations have stalled, hence we are likely see a continuation to design to the old standards for some time, as developers have \nthree\n years to start a development from being given planning permission\n.  \n \nOverall, we observe that the \nG\novernment is gaining a reputation for setting headline grabbing green targets, then watering down targets when it comes to putting in place the details that lead to firm action and progress in reducing demand for heat\n.  \nThis is particularly true in respect of housebuilding\n,\n where lobbying has been very effective in gaining a softening of targets\n.  There is a disconnect, between what is designed and approved for planning and what is built and implemented.  \nThere is a particular problem in the new build housing sector with the increasing number of tower blocks that are being built\n.  \nBuilders are encouraged to install centralised heating plant and onsite generation through planning and the code for sustainable homes (which triggers funding for social housing)\n.  \nThese systems are complex and require close control, usually through a combination of individual controls in \nthe flats and a central \nBuilding Management System (\n“\nBMS”)\n.  \nThe problem with such buildings is that there is usually no clear ‘owner’ of the building’s BMS, so that typically, individual flat dwellers have no right to information from the developer or freeholder\n.  \nDavid Frise, B&amp;ES’s \nH\nead of \nS\nustainability, has personal experience of this situation \n-\n even though he is a director of his apartment block’s residents association, he has been refused meaningful information from the developer and the freeholder has no interest in getting involved\n.  \nThe result is that the system does not operate correctly but the residents cannot get the necessary information to make it work\n.  \nThis is an example of the planner’s carbon and energy reduction intent being met through the installation of equipment but with no regard being paid to the “\ndoes it work\n” element\n.  \n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBiomass is deemed a key fuel for heat production from both the cost and GHG perspectives\n.  \nWhat should be done to ensure methods of calculating biomass GHG balance represent an accurate picture?\nThere should be ‘whole cycle’ analysis and consideration of the transport carbon costs and the displacement of food production, together with consideration of the true embodied energy of any processing of fuels, such as compressed wood pellets or liquefaction of crops.\n2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are sustainability guidelines for biomass\n.  \nD\no these go far enough?\nNo\n.  \nThe guidelines that are in place need to be more focussed and integrated\n.  \nThe Bio-liquid and the Solid and Gaseous Biomass Carbon Calculators are not user friendly\n.  \nBiomass technology is not always as ‘green’ as it is perceived\n.  \nCertain fuel sources \n-\n in particular roundwood specifically grown for biomass installations \n-\n may not deliver the carbon paybacks needed to meet national emissions targets\n.  \nIt is also important that the correct method of measuring environmental performance be used\n.  \nA B&amp;ES Forum has advised the \nGovernment\n to consider the ‘Green Ticks’ scheme operated by the Green Business Network\n.  \nThis gives organisations credit for putting suitable policies in place; complying with legislation, reviewing suppliers, enthusing staff and using robust environmental management\n.  \nGreen Ticks would be a way of ensuring all ‘rival’ methodologies used to assess the performance of buildings receive credit and are operated in a complementary way.\nThe new requirements for the RHI for sustainable biomass fuel supply and air quality controls that were recently introduced are welcomed\n.\n2.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat will the local environmental impact (for example\n,\n air pollution) be from the use of heat generation in urban areas, for example CHP units?\nOne specific observation we would like to make is for \nGovernment\n to reconsider providing support for biomass systems in urban settings, due to air quality issues\n.  \nWe should like to commend to the committee the \nPolicy Exchange Report\n, \nSomething in the Air - The forgotten crisis of Britain’s poor air quality\n, which says the RHI should \nnot support biomass technologies in cities\n.\n2.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat are the relative merits of using gas to directly provide space heating\n, c\nompared to centralised electricity production plus domestic heat pumps? \nGas is a reliable, fully-proven fuel source\n.  \nUntil such time as electricity generation is significantly de\n-\ncarbonised, mains gas is the best option where it is available.\nOfgem has been warning about looming electricity shortages and this in turn is focusing more attention on energy security\n.  \nThe \nGovernment\n’s electricity generation strategy is based around a switch from fossil fuels to a de-carbonised grid through nuclear, wind, biomass and some localised generation, eg solar PV\n.  \nWhile welcome in principle, delays to this programme mean we are somewhere between the two, with the grid de\n-\ncarbonisation plan years behind schedule\n.  \nIn any case, planning requirements and funding are driving inappropriate choices\n.  \nB&amp;ES is seeing heat pump and biomass installations that will not achieve any net carbon emissions savings, where gas with energy efficiency upgrades would be less costly, more effective and easier to achieve\n.  \nThis is particularly prevalent on social housing projects\n.\n2.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhy is community heating/CHP not more common in the UK?\nThis is largely due to inadequate and ineffective planning legislation and the complexity of building ownership, ie\n \nfreehold / leasehold / tenant agreements\n.  \nThere is a fear that such systems will not work and will in turn impact back on the landlord, building owner or occupier\n.  \nThe key is to ensure CHP is properly specified and designed\n.  \nMost of the problems users have had with CHP in the past were related to over-sizing, which meant the CHP did not run continuously\n.  \nIdeally, it should be sized to about 15% of the heat demand, this will mean the engine keeps working hard and continually generating ‘free’ electricity while satisfying the increasing need for low cost, low carbon heat.\nCHP now provides 7.5% of the UK’s electricity requirements and saves 14 million tonnes of CO\n2\n per year, according to \nDECC\n.  \nHowever, mis-selling and false promises have been a problem\n.  \nCHP has suffered in the past from being misapplied including being used simply to get a tick in a box from a planning officer so as to gain planning permission for a development\n.  \nAnother often missed opportunity has been the failure to ‘marry’ several technologies to further reduce carbon intensity\n.  \nFor example, electricity generated by on-site CHP can be used to power electric heat pumps \n-\n so increasing the already significant energy and carbon emission benefits of each technology.\nThe Carbon Trust has carried out extensive field trials in the UK and concluded that “\na mini-CHP unit can provide savings of between 15% and 20% when it is applied as the lead boiler\n”\n.  \nIt works best in applications with high and continuous heating loads like hospitals, leisure centres, sheltered accommodation and fire stations, because the longer it is running to meet heating demand, the more efficient it \nis\n.\n2.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat are the lock-in, costs and GHG savings from the promotion of different forms of domestic heating solution?\n \nThis is such a wide and generalised question that we feel unable to provide a reasoned response.\n2.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nShould the \nG\novernment take further any specific actions in relation to cooling?\n \nHeat used for cooling through absorption chillers is included in the RHI because it counts under the Renewable Energy Directive (\n“\nRED\n”\n)\n.  \nCooling generated by heat pumps is not included\n.  \nWith ground source heat pumps in particular, cooling is one half of the equation\n, eg \ncooling in summer replenishes the heat store for the winter, so improving the overall efficiency of the system\n.  \nEfforts should therefore be made to have this included within the RED\n.\n2.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhy does the RHI not seem to promote heat pumps successfully?\n \nFor single technology suppliers, Biomass is a far easier sell\n.  \nSeemingly an easier technology to design and install, it can often be added to a conventional heating system without alteration, as it operates at the same temperatures as say an oil fired system\n.  \nIt therefore works well for the off-gas grid boiler replacement market\n.  \nHeat pumps need to operate at lower temperatures to achieve the higher COPs (“co-efficient of performances”) that give lower running costs\n.  \nIn new-build this is not a problem because the heating system can be designed for lower temperatures with \nunder floor\n heating or larger radiators\n.  \nReplacement boilers however would require system upgrades - eg, upsizing of radiators - that add to the costs and inconvenience to the householder\n.  \nThere can also be problems in rural areas with inadequate electrical supplies unable to support the additional electrical loads required by heat pumps\n.\n2.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHow successful will the RHI be when rolled out to households?\nThis would need a definition of success not currently made clear by \nGovernment\n.  \nIndustry has broadly welcomed the scheme and it has led to a marked increase in interest from householders as reported by B&amp;ES installer members\n.  \nA number of issues have been raised around contradictory advice from a Green Deal Assessment (“GDA”) and the Microgeneration Installer Standards (“MIS”)\n.  \nWe have seen several cases of a GDA recommending one technology, Liquefied Petroleum Gas, whilst the MIS calculation suggested Air Source Heat Pump was the better solution\n.  \nClearly these anomalies need to be ironed out\n.  \nIf not, while there will be many more installations, some may not be appropriate There is no benefit from installing renewable technologies (except solar thermal) where the gas grid is available\n.\n2.12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThermal storage is a potential useful method of balancing electricity/energy demand\n,\n both diurnally and annually\n.  \nWhat \nis \nGovernment\n policy doing to promote thermal storage, and should it do more/different?\nWe are not clear on how much support the \nGovernment\n is giving to thermal storage\n.  \nIt barely warranted a mention in the \nGovernment\n’s December 2011\n,\n \nThe Carbon Plan: Delivering our \nl\now \nc\narbon \nf\nuture\n.\nThere is potential for more encouragement of onsite thermal storage in locations that have the space for it such as schools, office blocks and hospitals\n.  Thermal storage can be successful if combined with smart tariffs and metering, which encourage individuals and organisations to plan when they use, generate and store heat.\nLast year, in conjunction with the Technology Strategy Board, DECC launched an Advanced Heat Storage Competition for small businesses, a small-scale\n, \nbut welcome initiative\n.  \nWe would like to see more of this type of programme with greater involvement of trade associations like ourselves.\nDECC Advance Heat Storage Project Brief\n \nThere is similar potential in the household sector with regard to the increasing number of tower blocks that are being built in British cities by construction companies to address the need for affordable housing\n.  \nHowever, an issue with such buildings is that there is usually no clear ‘owner’ of the building’s Building Management System, so that typically, individual flat dwellers have no right to information from the management company or freeholder\n.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember\n 2013\n&#xa0;\nCopyright © 2013 by the\nBuilding &amp;
