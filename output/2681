[normal]Written evidence submitted by the Academy of Social Sciences (GSH0013)[bold]1[bold].[bold] [bold]  The Academy of Social Sc
[normal]ie
[normal]nces welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Committee’s inquiry into Government Horizon Scanning
[normal] and wishes to highlight the importance of 
[normal]social
[normal] sciences in horizon scanning a
[normal]c
[normal]tivities
[normal].
[normal]2[bold].[bold]  [bold]The Academy
[normal] commends the championing of horizon scanning by the Cabinet Secretary and supports the aspiration towards greater joining up of horizon scanning activities across government. The Day review observed that a senior champion was necessary in order 
[normal]for horizo
[normal]n scanning to 
[normal]be applied
[normal] 
[normal]effectively and 
[normal]strategically across Departments.
[normal]3[bold].[bold]  The work strands identified for the 2013 Horizon Scanning Programme are all in areas addressed by research in social sciences:  emerging technologies; emerging economies; changing supply and demand of resources; changing social attitudes of young people;
[normal] the future of demographic change in the UK.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]All of these topics require an understanding of human behaviour and behaviour change in order to meet future challenges.
[normal] 
[normal]4[bold].[bold]  Social scientists (including Academicians) are already involved in the horizon scann
[normal]ing activities of the Foresight programmes, working alongside natural scientists and other experts to bring 
[normal]evidence
[normal] to policy making in key areas. 
[normal] For example, t
[normal]he Foresight programme on Identities is likely to form a useful backdrop to the strand on cha
[normal]nging social attitudes of young people, as it examined the changing nature of identity in the digital age
[normal],
[normal] and in terms of social plurality with the attendant risks of extrem
[normal]ism, amongst other relevant aspects
[normal].   
[normal]In considering changing social attitudes of
[normal] young people and the future of demographic change, issues around intergenerational resource distribution and wider social values are likely to emerge, and to benefit from insights from social science research
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]5[bold]. [bold] [bold]The Cabinet Secretary is to be supported
[normal] in horizon scanning work by the Cabinet Secretary Advisory Group (CSAG) which includes Departmental leads from across government, the Head of the Civil Service and the Government’s Chief Science Adviser.  As noted above, social scientists are embedded in 
[normal]many Foresight group
[normal]s
[normal], and
[normal] active in research areas of central relevance to the horizon scanning work strands.  This 
[normal]activity
[normal] may be even more effective across 
[normal]government
[normal],
[normal] were a social scientist with oversight across the Departmental and work strands relevant to horizon scanning
[normal],
[normal] also at the table.
[normal]6[bold].[bold]  [bold]The Academy of Social 
[normal]Sciences
[normal] and the Campaign for Social Sciences
[normal] 
[normal]have advocated for
[normal] some time 
[normal]for 
[normal]the reinstatement of 
[normal]the post of Government Chief Social Scientist to draw together social science evidence, research and best 
[normal]practice
[normal] at the highest levels.  The championing of cross-
[normal]government
[normal] 
[normal]horizon
[normal] scanning provides yet more impetus for the collation of social science re
[normal]search to meet strategic aims and indicates a demand for co-ordinated input of social research at the heart of Government.
[normal]7.[bold] [bold]The Academy of 
[normal]Social
[normal] Sciences can draw upon a membership of more than 9
[normal]5
[normal]0 peer-elected Academicians and 
[normal]46
[normal] Learned Societies in t
[normal]he social sciences in order to provide expertise to policymakers, professionals and the public.  We would be happy to contribute further to the Committee’s work on Government Horizon scanning and response to future risks and challenges.
