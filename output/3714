[normal]Cycle Lanes in Sheffield
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Cycle lanes in Sheffield are incoherent, difficult to navigate and at times pitch cyclists and pedestrians against each other. They are often placed in short sections on roads as traffic calming measures.  A recent long term 
[normal]contract between Sheffield City Council and Amey only guarantees “like for like” renovation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am a 52 year old GP who cycles to work 2-3 days a week right across the city centre. It keeps me fit, and “doing my rounds” reminds me that frail elderly people
[normal] were once fit and active; when they see me in my helmet they start telling me of weekends spent cycling from the city to the East Coast and into the Peak District. However they would find the roads a much more hostile place to navigate now, with many lorr
[normal]ies and cars accelerating much faster than before, on a crumbling road surface. I feel much safer on my mountain bike on these roads as the potholes are large and frequent.
[normal] I always wear a helmet and observe traffic notices and lights.

[normal]Three years ago I o
[normal]pted for a speed awareness course to avoid a fixed penalty notice (as a driver not a cyclist!).  This was informative and has had an impact on my driving. During this course participants were informed about the methods used by the highways agency to make r
[normal]oads safer in accident spots. One method is to make roads appear narrow by using markings; one particular way is to place a short section of cycle lane as well as a central bollard. This explained to me the mystery of 30 metre long, isolated cycle lanes wh
[normal]ich give a cyclist a dangerous sense of increased protection.

[normal] Sheffield City Council recently signed a £2 billion, 25 year contract with 
[normal]Amey
[normal] 
[normal]https://www.sheffield.gov
[normal].uk/roads/works/schemes/streetsaheadproject.html
[normal] , which is already delivering smooth surfaced, well marked and lit streets. However there is no provision within this contract to improve the situation for the growing number of cyclists (as evidenced by 
[normal]the growth of cycle shops from a handful of small frame makers and independent suppliers to the presence of most of the major national players in this market). The council’s web page on the road improvement lists all the benefits without mention of cyclist
[normal]s. Researching this submission led me to cyclesheffield, an organisation I will now join, which is campaigning and trying to work with Amey to get the best out of the situation: 
[normal]http://www.cyclesheffield.org.uk/2013/11/08/scc-carry-on-installing-crap-cycle-lanes/
[normal]  is an example of how not to “improve” cycle lanes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am proud to be part of a campaign to improve physical activity in Sheffield, “Move More” 
[normal]http://www.movemoresheffield.com/holding.php
[normal] . This aims to improve the physical and emotional health of the people of Sheffield over 20 years by encouraging people to just do more; this is not abo
[normal]ut elite athletic aspirations, but more about walking to the shops, taking up jogging and particularly building exercise into the day, such as cycling to work. 
[normal]Without a decent network of cycle friendly roads, this remains a dream.
