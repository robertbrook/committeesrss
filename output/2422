default2.0 defaultSummarydefault&#xa0;default2.1default 
defaultVulnerable people across Scotland face growing difficulties accessing and sustaining the housing and support they need due to the cumulative impact of welfare reform.  
defaultProviders of housing and housing support have concerns about the following aspects of we
defaultlfare reform:
default&#xa0;default3.0 defaultThe impact of defaultchanges to the way housing costs are dealt with under welfare reformdefault              default              
default              
default              
default              
default              
default              
default3.1default 
defaultOne of the changes which has not yet been fully implemented but which is causing some concern is the plan to pay housing costs through a monthly payment directly to the tenant rather than to the landlord.  
defaultThe
defaultre have been various
default direct payments demonstrat
defaultion projects
default across the UK and they
default have highlighted an increase in rent arrears. Arrears across the demonstration 
defaultprojects ranged from 3% to 12%. In Scotland
default, Dun
defaultedin Canmore has been a 
defaultde
defaultmonstrator project and 
defaulthas found that ‘
defaultengagement, advice on budget
defaulting and financial inclusion will involve markedly more intense housing management resource commitment and staff liaison than has traditionally been the case’
default.
default 
defaultThis could have significant cost implications in terms of housing management at a time when renta
defaultl income is under increasing pressure.   
defaultIn addition, we are aware that during this demonstration project a dedicated Citizens Advice Bureau adviser was made available to assist tenants and we are concerned that this level of resource will not be available
default to other registered social landlords on full roll out. 
default&#xa0;
default3.4default 
defaultDirect payment
default is
default just one aspect of welfare reform; there are other aspects
default, such as the expectation that claimants will submit benefit applications online
default which will have an impact on the way 
defaultin which 
defaultclaimants obtain assistance 
defaultto meet 
defaulthousing costs
default and will impact on the way local services 
defaultprovide support to do so
default 
default.
default 
defaultUnder the Local Support Service Framework
default 
default(LSSF) 
defaultvarious groups of people
default, including those with support needs,
default 
defaultmay not be 
defaultexpected to manage direct payments
default and digital access at least
default initially.  Th
defaultis approach is to be welcomed.  
defaultWe urge that further detail be provided to set out exactly who will be eligible for this different approach and for how long so as to avoid unnecesdefaultsary defaultconfusion which will servedefault only to defaultdisempower vulnerable claimants further.default  defaultThis is particularly important for those people using short term supported accommodation and the providers of those services including homeless hostels and womens refuges.
default&#xa0;
default3default.5default 
defaultWe 
defaultare aware
default that under th
defaulte LSSF, local partnerships are to 
defaultbe formed to assess and plan services to help claimants who require support to deal with the 
defaultchanges t
defaulto the welfare system and that these partnerships may involve the voluntary sector. 
defaultWe have already provided some input into the DWP’s plans to use ‘keyworkers’ as a means of providing the assistance that vulnerable claimants will require.  
defaultWe urge that a distinction between advice work and support work be maintained.default  defaultAlready we are awar
defaulte that 
defaultmany housing support services are working with people who face increasingly complex issues around managing money and budgeting and there is 
defaulta risk
default that support services are being diverted away from essential work on other 
defaultimportant daily living skil
defaultls and social skills. 
default&#xa0;
default3.6default 
defaultWe 
defaultnote that the statutory issues relating to the claimant commitment 
defaultwill be dealt with separately
default 
defaultfrom the local partnerships set out in
default the LSSF
default. 
default defaultWe are already aware
default, however,
default 
defaultthat the support the voluntary sector ha
defaults been 
defaultoffering to claimants can be negatively 
defaultimpact
defaulted
default up
defaulton by the requirements of the
default DWP’s
default ‘claimant commitment’. 
default 
defaultOne of the ways voluntary agencies have tried to help claimants has been to provide access to 
defaultcomputers and the 
defaultinternet. The numbers of people t
defaulthat have been able to use this facility has 
defaultbeen restricted
default by a requirement in some areas that claimants show they have been using the internet to job search on a full time basis.  
defaultWe would suggest that statutory agencies (DWP and Work Programme) become idefaultnvolved with local partnerships at an appropriate level to ensure the support services, planned and delivered locally, are available and effective for all those who need them.default  
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.7default 
defaultIn Scotland the ‘bedroom tax’ has affected 82,500 people
default.  This figure is somewhat lower than initially predicted due in part to the efforts made by social landlords to assist their tenants 
defaultto 
defaultmove if at all possible. The scope for more people to move to smaller properties is
default, however,
default greatly limited by the la
defaultck of smaller properties.  It is estimated that 20,000 one bedroom properties will become available 
defaultin the social rented sector in Scotland 
defaultover the next year but 60,000 
defaultof the 
defaultpeople affected by the ‘bedroom tax’ would need to move to a 
defaultone bedroom proper
defaultty to avoid the penalty
default plus around 23,000 homeless households require a one bedroom property in a year.  
defaultIt is evident that the ‘bedroom tax’ has created additional demand for a property type in short supply.  It is of particular concern that disabled peo
defaultple are being disproportionately affected by this penalty; 80% (63,500) of households in Scotland affected by the ‘bedroom tax’ include an adult with a disability under the 
defaultDisability Discrimination Act.
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.8default There 
defaultare 3,200 single-bed households in City 
defaultof Edinburgh Council area currently seeking housing &amp; only approximately 900 tenures available from local authority and registered social landlord allocations.
default 
defaultIn one week in May
default, 
default32 one bedroom social rented properties were advertised in Edinburgh, with a
defaultn average of 121 bids per property through its choice based lettings system.  Of these 32 properties:
default•
default              
default4 were sheltered housing
default•
default              
default4 were amenity properties or had some sort of age restriction (usually 55 and over)
default•
default              
default8 were on the ground floor
defaultOf the 16 re
defaultmaining properties there was an average of 149 bids per property.  This highlights the particular challenge that working age single people or couples may face in obtaining one bedroom accommodation.  This could be a particular issue for ex-offenders seekin
defaultg to find settled accommodation; this is known to be an important factor in reducing the risk of re-offending.
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.8default 
defaultDisabled people living in properties which have housing adaptations are not exempt from the penalty and are being forced to make 
defaultvery 
defaultdifficult decisions about whether to look for another home or not.  To gain assistance with the penalty 
defaulta disabled person
default can apply to their local authority for a discretionary housing payment
default but there is not entitlement to an award and even if one is mad
defaulte it will be
default time limited 
defaultaward with no future award
default guaranteed.
default  
defaultWe urge that disabled people whose homes have housing adaptations be exempt from the ‘bedroom tax’.default  default&#xa0;default3.9default 
defaultWe note that children are not expected to share bedrooms with disabled siblings.  
defaultWdefaulte would defaultalso defaulturge that couples who cannot share a bedroom because of illness or a disability of one of both parties also be exempt.default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default4.0 defaultSupported Housingdefault&#xa0;default4.1default 
defaultSupported housing will be dealt with separately from the Universal Credit system initially 
defaultbut
default a new system will be developed in the future (2014 onwards) and it is likely that the Westminster Government will devolve funding to Scotland for supported housing. 
default 
defaultThe future funding of supported housing for those who require assistance to meet housing 
defaultcosts is uncertain.  There is particular concern about the future financial stability of supported housing in respect of:
default     
defaultunringfenced funding at a local level;
default     
defaultcurrent cost of supported housing. 
default&#xa0;
default4.2default 
defaultIn the meantime some supported housing in Scotland 
defaultappears to be subject to aspects of welfare reform such as the ‘bedroom tax’
default,
default despite the Westminster Government’s stated intention to exempt supported housing from them.  The reason for this lies with the decision to restrict the definition of supported h
defaultousing to that of Supported Exempt Accommodation
default (SEA).  Unfortunately SEA
default:
default 
default&#xa0;
default4.3default 
defaultA joint survey
default undertaken by the HSEU, the Scottish Federation and Housing Associations and Homeless Action Scotland in March 2013 found that many supported housing providers anticipated difficulty in gaining exemptions from aspects of welfare reform
default,
default such as the bedroo
defaultm tax
default,
default because of the criteria associated with Supported Exempt Accommodation.  The survey found that:
default     
defaulthousing services would not fall within the definition
defaultof SEA. This 
defaultcould mean that some vulnerable people in Scotland will not be able to meet housing related costs associated with supported housing. 
defaultsome extent. Supported housing aimed
default 
defaultat
default people with ment
defaultal health problems; 
default      
defaultpeople with 
defaultlearning
default 
defaultdisabilities; people with physical disabilities and homeless
default 
defaultresettlement projects appear most likely not to meet the criteria for
default 
defaultSEA.
default&#xa0;
default4.4default 
defaultThe DWP has acknowledged the need to update the existing definition of Supported Exempt Accommodation and while we welcome this decision we are concerned that 
defaultindications so far suggest that 
defaultlocal authority owned accommodation will not be included in any r
defaultevision.
default  
default&#xa0;
default4.5default 
defaultAlmost a third of refuge accommodation is owned by local authorities in Scotland and does not qualify as exempt. The majority of local authorities have continued to exempt this 
defaultaccommodation from the under occupation charge for this financi
defaultal year while 
defaultthey await 
defaultthe outcome of the DWP’s 
defaultreview of
default housing benefit and supported accommodation. 
defaultIn 
default some area
defaults, however,
default there has 
defaultalready 
defaultbe
defaulten an impact on refuge services, for instance in one area where a refuge has been assessed as not qualifyi
defaultng as exempt (although this is being challenged) it is now unable to offer a service to women and children unless they would qualify for a 3 bedroom flat under the ‘bedroom tax’ rules.  In other areas 
defaultWomen
default’s Aid services are being advised that the local a
defaultuthority grant they have come to rely on will be reduced in the next year to offset the costs of covering the current benefit shortfall caused by the ‘bedroom tax’.
default&#xa0;
default4.6default 
defaultRefuge services in Scotland are already unable to meet demand; 
defaulta recent 
defaultannual census 
defaultday survey found that 2 out of 3 women were unable to get a refuge space for themselves and their children because of the lack of safe or suitable space.
default  Where women are not able to access refuge for themselves and their children when they need to they ma
defaulty be at risk of returning to abusive partners or forced to accept unsuitable bed and breakfast accommodation through a local authority which will no longer have access to appropriate temporary self-contained accommodation.
default&#xa0;
default4.7default 
defaultThe ‘bedroom tax’ is already
default limiting the options for people facing homelessness and could impact on the availability of supported accommodation provided through the ‘Housing First’ model which is being piloted in Glasgow by Turning Point.  Under this model
default,
default people facing homelessness avoid using temporary accommodation whilst accessing the support they need.
default  The ‘bedroom tax’ restrict
defaults
default available accommodation for single people and couples facing homelessness
default,
default and result in greater demand being placed on te
defaultmporary accommodation.
default&#xa0;
default4.8default 
defaultWhilst local authorities may decide to prioritise some assistance for supported housing services that do not meet the SEA criteria through the Discretionary Housing Payments (DHP) this can only be regarded as a short term soluti
defaulton given the intense pressure on DHP. 
defaultThis increase in pressure was evidenced by t
defaulthe
default number of applications for Discretiona
defaultr
defaulty Housing Payments 
defaultin
default 
defaultGlasgow City Council, for instance,
default 
defaultwith
default 5,501 applications for DHP in April 2013 compared with just 1,437 in 
defaultApril 2012.
default  
defaultAlthough
default the Scottish Government has set out plans to increase the amount available for discretionary housing payments in 2013/14 t
defaulthis is not a long term solution.
default&#xa0;default5.0 defaultSevere povertydefault&#xa0;
default5.1default 
defaultThere is growing evidence that people are being 
defaultforced into greater poverty due to welfare refor
defaultm.  The Tru
defaultssell Trust has been highlighting an increasing use of foodbanks
default and Citizens Advice services have reported that increasing numbers of people are coming to them in ‘extreme poverty’.  Whilst the v
defaultoluntary sector is responding to this growing demand it is of great concern that people have to turn to them for help to survive.  Indeed the Stirling Citizen Advice Bureau has recently developed a ‘Survival Guide’ to help people deal with ‘no money, no fo
defaultod and no power’.
default  
default&#xa0;
default5.2default 
defaultSupport workers are working with an increasing number of people who face benefit sanctions.  This is a particular issue for people required to demonstrate to 
defaultJ
defaultob 
defaultC
defaultentre staff that they are looking for work.  There appears to be a 
defaultlack of consistency between job centres about what constitutes suitable evidence. 
defaultYoung care leavers and 
defaultyoung people in transition
default 
defaultare facing major problems with sanctions and conditionality because of the p
defaultarticular challenges they face
default 
defaultand we would urge that their needs are given further consideration in 
defaultl
defaultine with those set out by the National Care Advisory Service (NCAS)
default.
default 
default 
defaultOther people have faced sanctions relating to attendance at medical assessments and have had to wait 8 weeks witho
defaultut benefit payments until the outcome of their appeal.  In this case a crisis grant was obtained through the Scottish Welfare Fund but was not sufficient to last 8 weeks.
default 
defaultThere is concern that once a sanction
default has been applied (even if it has
default clearly been a
defaultpplied wro
defaultngly), there is nothing any organisation or authority can do to prompt the DWP or Job C
defaultentre to 
defaultlift the sanction.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.3default 
defaultPeople 
defaultwho
default do not qualify for an advance benefit payment nor for a payment through the Scottish Welfare Fund are being advised to go to a food bank.  This is particularly difficult in rural areas where people may not have the means to travel the distances involved.
