[[[Written evidence from the Police for Crime Commissioner for Northamptonshire [CST0075]]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;Thank you for your letter of 6th December regarding the Public Administration Select Committee's ongoing inquiry into Crime Statistics.&#xa0;I have been following the progress of your inquiry closely over the past few months and look forward to reading the Select Committee's final report and recommendations in due course.&#xa0;Firstly, I recognise that the accurate recording of crime statistics plays a vital role in ensuring public confidence in policing and is vital to informing operational decision making, a view which I know is shared by my Chief Constable.&#xa0;Secondly, turning to the questions that you have raised in your letter, I am aware that in the past policing has been heavily target focussed something which I am not particularly keen to reintroduce at a local level, especially following the Home Secretary's decision to remove centrally appointed targets.&#xa0;

[[[What targets if any do you set for your Police Force?]]]&#xa0;I think it is important that you define what you mean by 'target'. The abolished targets HMG refers to set up a perverse performance culture where by it was all about the target and not the outcome - process over people.&#xa0;I have set one specific numerical target in my Police and Crime Plan. I want to see at least a 40% reduction in violent crime offences across our county.&#xa0;When I was first elected as Police and Crime Commissioner, Northamptonshire had the same level of violence offences as Merseyside, Greater Manchester and the West Midlands.&#xa0;I am sure you will agree that Northamptonshire has little in common with such places. For example, they face significant additional pressure on their resources in part due to their more urban environments.&#xa0;The 40% reduction is merely a way of describing the kind of transformational change I want to see. Also it is a challenge to the whole system - not just the Police. For instance what will the CPS contribution be to meet that reduction? Prisons? Etc.&#xa0;

[[[What impact do you think this has on police recording of crime practices?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]My hope in setting such an ambitious target is to focus minds on the enormity of the challenge we face in making Northamptonshire the Safest Place in England and Northamptonshire Police the best performing force in the Country.&#xa0;There are a number of checks and balances Police Forces have to contend with including the Home Office, IPCC, HMIC, the General Public and the Police and Crime Commissioner.&#xa0;I do not feel that the one specific numerical target I have set for the Force creates any additional pressure on the Police. It is however a fact that my Police and Crime Plan, my strategic direction and support of the Chief Constable has resulted in the fastest fall in crime than anywhere in the UK over the last twelve months.&#xa0;To me that is the best indication of what I'm doing works.&#xa0;

[[[How do you assure yourself that recorded crime figures in your area are]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[correct?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The recording of crime statistics is first and foremost a matter that sits under the direction and control of the Chief Constable.&#xa0;Police recorded crime is an important indicator of Force performance and is used in the performance and accountability meetings that are held between my Office and the Police Force.&#xa0;A protocol has been established between myself and the Chief Constable which describes how I will hold him accountable for performance. This is built on a trusting relationship that the data and information provided to the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner by the Force is accurate. &#xa0;

[[[To what extent can you trust the statistics for your area?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Despite National Crime Recording Standards, there is not a level playing field when comparing forces. This is due to the fact that the same crime in one force area can be subject to different recording practices in another. As a result, those making judgements on statistics alone might assess Northamptonshire Police as a Force that is performing poorly.&#xa0;The force has set up a National Crime Recording Standards (NCRS) group led by an Assistant Chief Constable to "ensure a professional, ethical and pragmatic approach to the recording of crime to provide a policing service with integrity". This group is formed by core parts of the organisation responsible for data quality, crime management and investigation. This group meets quarterly to review performance, addresses areas of concern and commissions data quality audits. Audits conducted during 2013 include: robbery, threats to kill, domestic burglary, vehicle crime, harassment and Section 5 Public Order Act and criminal damage to dwellings. This helps the Force to understand current recording practices and make any necessary changes, it is worth noting that few crimes have been reclassified or cancelled suggesting the Force's recording for these crimes is accurate.&#xa0;At-the beginning of2013, the force adopted an 'investigate to record' practice, which is applied by other forces, which has coincided with an impact on recorded crime figures. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabularies have identified this issue and are investigating to determine the extent of these changes and to what extent the reductions reported are 'real'. The Force has reassured me that crime recording retains the highest of standards and integrity.&#xa0;I trust that this provides the clarity that you were looking for. If I can be of any further assistance in the future, please do not hesitate to contact me.&#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;
