[[[ MP, Chair,]]]

[[[Energy and Climate Change Committee (FTF 11)]]]&#xa0;Thank you for your letter of 16 December.&#xa0;I am replying in a personal capacity rather than on behalf of the Energy and Climate Change Committee. I draw in particular on my experience as Chair of the Environmental Audit Committee in the last Parliament. I was conscious of the difficulty of maintaining the focus of the Committee as the date for a possible General Election drew nearer.&#xa0;Against this background I believe that fixed-term Parliaments and the consequent greater certainty about the dates of General Elections will be helpful to the work of Select Committees.&#xa0;In the current Parliament it will be easier for the Energy and Climate Change Committee to plan its work programme right through until the spring of 2015 in the clear knowledge that the House of Commons will still be in session at that time. This will mean that both Members and Committee staff can remain focused on completing a fuller programme than would be possible if there was uncertainty about the date of the General Election.&#xa0;Inevitably the ability to achieve consensus in Committee reports may be eroded as election campaigning begins in earnest but even this consideration will be made somewhat easier by the removal of uncertainty about the election date. As Members and Committee staff become accustomed to fixed term Parliaments, there may be greater scope for better strategic planning, right at the start of a Parliament, on what the Committee wants to achieve over five years. This may, for example, help Committees to take a proactive approach to scrutiny and help set the agenda in its policy area.&#xa0;9 January 2014&#xa0;&#xa0;
