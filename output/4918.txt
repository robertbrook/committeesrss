[[[&#xa0;]]]Thank you for your letter of 12 November.&#xa0;Attached is the correspondence referred to in the Guardian article of 5 May 2013. You will see that · the email exchange to which  the Guardian refers is about. Pilot applications for London. These applications were read, assessed and selected entirely by the Greater London Authority (GLA). DCLG had no input or influence over the selection of these Pilots.&#xa0;It is also worth noting that the Department on a number of occasions made clear the importance of maintaining distance between the selection of the Portas Pilots and the television show. This was made explicit in the letter from Grant Shapps to Mary Portas in February 2012, "it [is] very clear that there should be no involvement by either Yellow Door or Optomen in the selection of pilots", and re-iterated again via email by David Morris in April 2013, "we need to avoid any perception of a conflict of interest between pilot selection and the TV show - which are. separate projects. I also attach the letter from Grant Shapps from the end of February.&#xa0;On your second  question, Sue Higgins was seconded  to the Cabinet Office at my request to drive forward the work on the strengthening corporate functions  such as human resources and procurement  across  Whitehall.  Sue was already closely  involved  in this  work and  the move flowed out of the next phase of the Civil Service Plan after the One year on Report in July. Ishould also add for information that Sue will be. moving shortly to a new post at the National Audit Office.&#xa0;21 November 2013&#xa0;
