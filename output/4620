default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLeonard Cheshire Disability believes that disability defaultshoulddefault defaultbe at the heart of development. Disability must therefore be explicitly referenced in the post-2015 development framework.default With 
defaultapproximately
default a billion disabled people across the globe
default,
default it will simply not be possible to secure the optimum development outco
defaultmes unless disabled people are fully included and mainstreamed within 
defaultall 
defaultdevelopment programmes.
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo this end we believe that the UK Government must be at the forefront of pushing for disability to be referenced in the post-2015 development frameworkdefault. The
default UK is well placed to be a leading voice in this call, which could help ensure that millions of disabled people 
defaultare fully included in 
defaultdevelopment work.
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe recognise that there has been a willingness to pursue this agenda within the Department for Internat
defaultional Development, particularly through a number of key programmes.
default&#xa0;
default1.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe would however suggest that it is difficult to identify the
default extent to which mainstreaming
default of disability issues has actually 
defaulthappened across the Department. 
defaultWe defaultsuggest that the defaultDepartment producedefaultsdefault a specific disability strategydefault 
defaultwith a set of clear outcomes and indic
defaultators to measure
default its impact on disabled people
default.
default We recommend that 
defaulta full-time senior civil servant is appointed in the defaultdepartmentdefault to oversee the implementation of thisdefault strategy.default 
default&#xa0;
default1.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe recommend that the Department 
defaultdevelopdefaultsdefault a monitoring and evaluation framework that specifically defaultmeasures defaultdisability defaultinclusion defaultin their mainstream policies and programmes, at both global and country levelsdefault.
default&#xa0;
default1.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe recommend that DFID looks to fu
defaultnd 
defaultinstitutional 
defaultdevelopment 
defaultand capacity building 
defaultof disabled people’s organisations in low and middle income countries.
default&#xa0;
default1.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe recommend that explicit reference is made 
defaultfor the inclusion of 
defaultdisabled people and their allies in future DFID
default-
defaultfunded disability
default-specific and mainstream
default initiatives.
default&#xa0;
default1.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is clear from our research that there is no “one size fits all” solution to addressing the entrenched and systematic exclusion and poverty of disabled people in developing countries
default. 
defaultWedefault 
defaulttherefore recommenddefault that DFIdefaultD takes a key strategic role in negotiating with defaultfellow defaultbilateral adefaultnd multilateral donor agencies to developdefault appropriate tools for monidefaulttoring the impact ofdefault disability-specific defaultand mainstream development programmesdefault.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAt Leonard 
defaultCheshire Disability, we work for a society in which every person is equally valued. We believe that disabled people should have the freedom to live their lives the way they choose - with the opportunity and support to live independently, to contribute econ
defaultomically, and to participate fully in society.
default&#xa0;
defaultL
defaulteonard Cheshire Disability's International Department works through five regional 
defaultoffices in Africa and Asia. We support
default children with disabilities to 
defaultget an education
default, adults with disabilities to earn a living, and all disabled people to access the rehabilitation, health and other support they need. 
defaultWe also campaign
default to put disability at the heart of international development, and support young disabled peop
defaultle to campai
defaultgn for their rights through our Young Voices p
defaultrogramme
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition, the Leonard Cheshire Disability and Inclusive Development Centre, University College London (which is part of 
defaultour
default International Department), undertakes world-class qualitative and quant
defaultitative research in the field of disability 
defaultand international development
default. We focus on 
defaultpolicy analysis
default, disability and poverty, livelihoods, 
defaultinclusive education
default and
default disability in conflict-affected countries
default and in disaster and emergency situations
default.

default&#xa0;
defaultThe adequacy of DFID’s current policy commitments on disability and development, and whether it needs a disability strategydefault&#xa0;default3.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLeonard Cheshire Disability recognises and welcomes the leading role that DFID has taken in the field on disabilit
defaulty and international development during the past 15 years. This 
defaultis 
defaultevidenced by the production of the issues paper, 
defaultDisability, Poverty and
default 
defaultDevelopment
default, (2000), which spearheaded the highly influential “twin track approach” to disability programming. DFID has also been proactive in commissioning four discrete research programmes on disability and international development issues, which has made a signifi
defaultcant contribution to the growing body of knowledge in this field, including 
defaultevidence that is now regularly used to support 
defaultthe UN 
defaultConvention
default 
defaulton Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDFID has also produced a 
defaultHow to Note on Working on Disability in 
defaultCountry Programmes,
default 
defaultwritten primarily for DFID country staff. However, since its publication in 2
default009, there is little evidence of
default the extent to which this has influenced DFID’s programmes and policies at country level.
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn the recent past, there has been
default 
defaultan
default increasing commitment by DFID to incorporate and mainstream disability issues within its core programmes. The
default current
default 
defaultParliamentary Under-Secretary of State
default for
default International Development, Lynne Featherstone, has a personal commitment to disability issue
defaults
default. This is to be 
defaultcommended. However, it is important that this personal commitment becomes 
defaultinstitutionalised within DFID, so that disability continues to be prioritise
defaultd in
default international development, both within the UK Government, and also by other leading 
defaultbilateral and multilateral donor agencies.
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNotwithstanding these positive initiatives, at the programme level, it is difficult to evaluate the extent to which DFID has indeed mainstreamed disability across its work. 
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt remains the case that the economic
default case for the inclusion of disability issues within the international development framework needs to be constantly made and reaffirmed. The evidence base for inclusion of disability issues, though growing
default,
default still needs to be strengthened.
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA development of 
defaulta coherent disability strate
defaultgy by DFID
default would be very positive. It would embed a disability component into DFID’s
default work
default, and provide a clear set of priorities. This should 
defaultbe 
defaultdeveloped in collaboration 
defaultwith civil society institutions, 
defaultincluding disabled peop
defaultle’s organisations. 
defaultWe strongly recommend
default that this consultation process includes the input from disabled people and their representative organisations in low and middle income countries. DFID’s future disability strategy should embrace the principles and 
defaultcommitments 
defaultset out
default in the UNCRPD. It should also reflect
default the outcomes of The 
defaultReport of the 
defaultHigh Level Panel 
defaultof Eminent Persons on

default any 
defaultfuture 
defaultchanges
default to the global development framework. 
default&#xa0;
default3.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn order to ensure that disability issues are systemically institutionalised within DFID, 
defaultwe
default recommended that a full-time senior civil servant is appointed in the 
defaultdepartment
default, whose primary role is to make sure that d
defaultisability is included in all DFID policy and strategy initiatives including country programmes and DFID-funded projects with civil society institutions.
default&#xa0;
defaultIntegration of disability issues within DFID’s sector programmes (for example in health, education, sadefaultnitation, livelihoods, and empowerment) and its humanitarian workdefault&#xa0;default3.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is a strong link between disability and multi-dimensional poverty
default. It is not lack of funds alone but a lack of inclusion in important areas such as education, health services and soc
defaultial participation, as well as compounding factors such as gender, age and geographical location, that limit the opportunities for disabled people to overcome poverty. Research from the Leonard Cheshire Disability Inclusive Development Centre has recently t
defaultermed this the ‘Disability and Development Gap’
default: disabled people who are not included in development efforts fall increasingly further behind non-disabled members of their communities as development efforts increase. 
default&#xa0;
default3.9
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLeonard Cheshire 
defaultDisability 
defaultendorses
default the twin track approach to disability service provision as outlined in 
defaultDFID’s
default issues paper, 
defaultDisability, Poverty and Development
default (2000). We therefore recommend
default that DFID finances specifically targeted disability programmes as well as enabling disabled people and their families to access mainstream public services and development initiatives (including water and sanitation, public health, education and social pro
defaulttection).
default&#xa0;
default3.10
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe evaluation strategy developed for 
defaultDFID’s Girls’ Education Challenge (GEC) 
defaultgives a unique opportunity to generate strong evidence of what works and what does not
default.
default 
defaultLeonard Cheshire Disability 
defaultwelcomes the effort made by GEC to strengthen the 
defaultmonitoring and evaluation
default capacity of implementing agencies and to fund research initiatives. However there needs to be the right balance between the effort invested in generating the evidence and the 
defaultdirect response to the needs of
default disabled people.
default&#xa0;
default3.11
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDFID 
defaultneeds to develop 
defaulta 
defaultrobust moni
defaulttoring and evaluation framework
default at international and country level
default. This is in relevant in two 
defaultareas: first, with regard to DFID’s five-year country
default operational plans; and second
default with regard to DFID
default’s
default programmes through civil 
defaultsociety institutions. 
defaultThe framework
default should clearly measure and evaluate the specific impact(s) 
defaultthat 
defaultDFID’s disability-specific and mainstream initiatives have on disabled people. 
defaultIt 
defaultshould at 
defaulta 
defaultminimum 
defaultensure that 
defaultdata 
defaultis
default disaggregated by age, sex, categor
defaulty of impairment, and where possible, ethnicity, and geographical location (urban/rural 
defaultdivide
default).
default&#xa0;
default3.12
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is also important that DFID actively engages and provides financial support for the empowerment of disabled people’s organisations in low and middle income 
defaultcountries. Therefore, 
defaultDFID
default should fund the institutional development and strengthening of disabled people’s organisations
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.13
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultI
defaultn order to make disability-specific and mainstream programmes more inclusive,
default appropriate
default financial resources should be provided to support the design of innovative programmes at country level.
default&#xa0;
default3.14
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default We further encourage DFID to ensure that all key stakeholders receive Disability Awareness training and that disabled 
defaultpeople
default routinely sit on project

default.

default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe
default Cross-Cutting Disability Research Programme
default was a three-year initiative funded by DFID and managed by the Leonard Cheshire Disability and Inclusive Development Centre. The mandate was 
defaultto work with other DFID-funded Research Programme C
defaultonsortia 
default(RPC) 
defaultto mainstream a disability component into other i
defaultnternational development research areas. 
defaultR
defaultesearch was undertaken i

defaultaccess for persons with disabilities to 
defaultwater and sanitation (Zambia and Uganda); maternal and child health (Nepal); mental health
default, 
defaultstigma 
defaultand multi-dimensional poverty 
default(India); and urban agriculture (Kenya). 
defaultOne of the key lessons
default learned 
defaultfrom this research programme
default was that disability often 
defaultwas 
defaultnot considered 
defaultby 
defaultmainstream RPCs
default. It is therefore essential
default to 
defaultbuild the capacity of disabled p

defaulteir core campaigning activities.

defaultdes clear evidence of the value of making young disabled people the agents of their own destiny within development programmes. Young Voices is a global network of over 1,200 young disabled campaigners from over 20 countries in the global South. Through the

default.
default 
defaultOver 3,000 teachers were trained on accommodating children with disab
defaultilities in their classes. Preparatory classes for children with disabilities were organised prior to enrolment into mainstream schools, and an effective home-based education system was designed for areas where the terrain made it hard for children with hig
defaulth support needs to get to school. The project worked closely with schools to make them accessible; and with government officials to ensure that children with disabilities received any government entitlements
default due to them
default. The 
defaultproject also undertook advocacy and policy work, including the formation of parents groups and child-to-child clubs for children with and without disabilities to support meaningful inclusion. In total, over 2,700 children were successfully enrolled in thei
defaultr local primary schools. The project had a significant impact on changing attitudes towards disabled children’s rights to education; there are now more children with disabilities in local primary schools in 
defaultthe project locations

defaulty reduction tool.
default&#xa0;defaultThe role of disabled beneficiaries in planning, managing and monitoring DFID policy and programmesdefault&#xa0;
default3.20
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt has long been recognised, especially in rural development and international gender studies, that the most sustainable and efficient 
defaultoutcomes of development initiatives occur when participatory approaches to policy and programme design are employed
default. Within the international disability and development sector, a good example of this was the negotiation process of the UNCRPD. 
default&#xa0;
default3.21
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA
defaultdopting a
default participatory approach, if undertaking in a non-tokenistic manner, will incur financial
default 
defaultand human costs
default – for example provision of sign language interpreters,
default physically accessible venues
default, covering transport etc. We recommend 
defaultthat explicit reference is 
defaultmade
default 
defaultwithin the DFID disability strategy to the need
default to involve
default disabled people and their allies in the development of DFID-funded disability initiatives. It will also be important to explicitly state what processes and methodology will be employed to ensu
defaultre such engagement.
default&#xa0;
default3.22
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe believe
default that both disabled and non-disabled people have a legitimate role to play in relation to policy design, programme implementation and evaluation. 
default&#xa0;
default3.23
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe
default encourage 
defaultDFID to establish a working group, comprised of key individuals
default working in the disability and international development arena, who will provide strateg
defaultic advice and guidance to DFID on this issue.
default&#xa0;defaultThe financial costs and benefits of an increased emphasis on disabilitydefault&#xa0;default3.24
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe financial and human costs of 
defaultthe 
defaultcontinuing 
defaultexclusion of disability in international development are substantial. In 2000, the World Bank estimated that the annual loss to global GDP of people with disabilities not working who were in a position to 
defaultdo so
default was between $1
default.37 trillion and $1,94 trillion
default. This figure is
default likely
default to have increased substantially since 2000.
default&#xa0;
default3.25
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn the International Labour Organization’s 2009 study en
defaulttitled ‘The Price of Exclusion: The Economic Consequences of Excluding People with Disabilitie
defaults from the World of Work’
default,
default 
defaultt
defaulthe tota

defaultcost of avoidable unemployment among disabled persons to national economies was estimated to be between 1% and 7%
default of GDP
default.
default&#xa0;defaultThe UK’s role in ensuring post-2015 development goals consider disability issuesdefault&#xa0;
default3.26
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Millennium Development Goals made no explicit reference to 
defaultdisability issues. This was a significant omission
default. The post-2015

default This includes not only the final set of goals but systematic inclusion of disability in the monitoring and evaluation mechanisms built into all targets and indicators
