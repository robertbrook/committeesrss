defaultI am writing to you regarding the subject of the draft Deregulation Bill and the
defaultAldbourne Ridgeways.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe council has recently resurfaced the Ridgeway near Aldbourne and this has highlighted concerns regarding the rising crime levels in the local community. A higher level of motorised traffic now uses the Ridgeways and this has led to a significant number of break-ins to farm buildings and workshops in the surrounding area. The resurfaced Ridgeway provides access to and from crime scenes, not only for thieves on foot, but for their potentially fully loaded 4 x 4 vehicles. The vehicles can then disappear using the tracks without being caught on my expensive security cameras and devices; installed on the advice of the police and insurance companies. This consequently makes it harder for the police to trace the offenders.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs well as using the Ridgeways to gain access to private property, it has also been noted that people have been using the tracks to joy ride and race around the countryside causing significant danger to walkers and horse riders. It seems not unreasonable to ask the government to somehow restrict the Ridgeways to non motorised traffic so that everyone can continue to enjoy their countryside pursuits. One suggestion is either to install gates or posts at either end of the track to restrict motor vehicles.

defaultThank you in advance for your time in reading this letter and I look forward to your solutions,
