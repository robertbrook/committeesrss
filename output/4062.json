"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by BBC Watch [FBB 0041]Executive summary:a) The BBC consistently fails to meet its own Editorial Guidelines on accuracy and impartiality in its Middle East reporting, thus compromising its reputation as a trustworthy broadcaster.\nb) Such editorial failures are increasingly apparent on social media which is in rising use by BBC employees.\nc) The BBC consistently fails to meet its fifth public purpose with regard to its representation of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Middle East peace process, failing to promote well-rounded audience understanding of these issues.\nd) The current system of self-regulation and the over-complicated complaints system are considered unsustainable by members of the public. \nIntroduction:BBC Watch (\nhttp://bbcwatch.org/\n) is an independent project of CAMERA (Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America) which was established in October 2012 in order to monitor the BBC's coverage of Israel for accuracy and impartiality as defined by the BBC's own Editorial Guidelines. \nSince its establishment, BBC Watch has documented numerous breaches of those editorial guidelines and consistent failure to meet the terms of the fifth category of Public Purposes defined in the BBC's Charter \nDuring that time, BBC Watch has also been contacted by many members of the public with regard to the unsatisfactory BBC complaints procedure. \nHow well has the BBC performed in the current charter period in achieving its mission and public purposes?1) Breaches of Editorial Guidelines on Accuracy:\nFailures to meet Editorial Guidelines on accuracy are alarmingly common. Those failures appear in written, audio and filmed BBC content and increasingly on social media platforms used by BBC correspondents which, according to the BBC, are subject to the same editorial demands. \nExamples of inaccurate information promoted on social media include:\nA false \nclaim of an Israeli air raid\n on Gaza on 19/11/13.\n \nThe \nmisrepresentation of a picture\n from the conflict in Syria as having been taken in the Gaza Strip.\nInaccurate representation\n of casualty figures.\nInaccurate representation\n of cause of death of a Palestinian prisoner.\nExamples of inaccurate information in BBC reports include:\nRepeated misrepresentation of the Israeli view of the recent P5+1 talks with Iran – see \nhere\n, \nhere\n, \nhere\n and \nhere\n. \nFalse claims of a \n'secret' detention\n in Israel.\nMisrepresentation of a \ncriminal incident\n as hate crime.\nHistorical inaccuracies in BBC produced content and on its dedicated educational website – see examples \nhere\n, \nhere\n, \nhere\n, \nhere\n, \nhere\n, \nhere\n and \nhere\n. The significance of such inaccuracies is exacerbated\n by the fact that misleading articles remain on the BBC website as a 'permanent public record'. \nThe repeated \nmisrepresentation\n of the death of the son of a BBC employee in Gaza as having been caused by Israel (the \nUN established\n that it was the result of a misfired missile launched by Palestinian terrorists). Images associated with that widely promoted BBC story were \nlater\n \nused\n at anti-Israel rallies in the UK. \n2) Breaches of Editorial Guidelines on Impartiality:\nPromotion of political campaigns on social media by BBC journalists – see examples \nhere\n, \nhere\n.\nRepeated \npromotion and amplification\n of the agendas of politically motivated NGOs without due disclosure of their aims and agendas – see examples \nhere\n, \nhere\n and \nhere\n.  \nUse of 'expert comment' without due disclosure of affiliations and political views – see examples \nhere\n, \nhere\n, \nhere\n and \nhere\n. \n3) Public Purposes:\nThe fifth of the BBC's Public Purposes as defined in its Charter and Agreement is that of \"Bringing the UK to the world and the world to the UK\". The BBC Trust's interpretation of that remit includes a commitment to \"build a global understanding on international issues\". \nWith regard to the Arab-Israeli conflict, the BBC consistently \nneglects\n to inform its audiences of the scale of terror threats facing Israeli civilians. It frequently ignores incidents of missile fire at civilian targets and \nother\n terror attacks against them. It downplays the subject of Palestinian terrorism in general and has erroneously portrayed imprisoned terrorists as 'political prisoners' – see \nhere\n and \nhere\n.\nThe BBC's \nrepresentation\n of the subject of the Middle East peace process is frequently \nindistinguishable\n from that of the Palestinian Authority, with disproportionate – and \nfrequently inaccurate\n - emphasis on factors promoted by the PA as 'obstacles to peace'. At the same time, factors no less relevant to the peace process such as the Hamas/Fatah split, Palestinian terrorism, official PA incitement and glorification of terror and Israeli security \nconcerns are given considerably less coverage, thereby hampering audience understanding of the issue. \nBBC reporting from the areas controlled by the \nPalestinian Authority\n and Hamas is notable for its consistent avoidance of issues such as the oppression of minorities, women's rights, government corruption and the lack of press freedom. \nRemarkable too is the sheer scale of BBC reporting on Israel. Over the past nine months (\nMarch to November 2013 inclusive\n), Israel has consistently been in the top five Middle East countries receiving the most coverage on the BBC News website, despite the fact that much of the rest of the region continues to be plagued by political and military turmoil. \nOne particularly \nworrying\n characteristic of the BBC's Middle East reporting has been its tendency to promote unchallenged conspiracy theories and propaganda produced by repressive regimes to worldwide audiences – see examples \nhere\n, \nhere\n, \nhere\n, \nhere\n and \nhere\n. \nThe past year has also seen several cases of the \ndownplaying\n of \nantisemitism\n both \nin the UK\n and \nabroad\n by the BBC and moderation of \nantisemitic\n comments\n on the BBC's \npublic \nfora\n has not infrequently proved to be inadequate. The BBC's decision to host a known \nantisemitic\n Holocaust denier \non its Persian service\n is a cause for considerable concern and reinforces the impression that educational work on the subject of \nantisemitism\n is urgently \nneeded\n at the BBC.  \nHow should the BBC be governed, regulated and held accountable beyond 2016?4) The BBC complaints system:\nBBC Watch receives considerable amounts of correspondence from the general public with regard to the BBC's complaints system. Many of those members of the public are frustrated by the system's labyrinthine nature, the difficulties they experience in navigating it and the often slow response time to complaints. \nMembers of the public also express great dissatisfaction with the fact that the BBC is essentially a self-regulating body and that there is no possibility for impartial adjudication of complaints by an independent body. \nThe material collected on this subject by BBC Watch suggests that many members of the public would like to see the establishment of an independent ombudsman to deal with complaints regarding BBC content and that the current system of self-regulation is unsustainable. \n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
