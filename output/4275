[normal]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Question 1:  How robust are the conclusions in the AR5 Physical Science Basis report? [bold] [bold]How much scope is there to question of the report’s conclusions? [bold]&#xa0;

[normal]Question 3:  To what extent does AR5 reflect the range of views among climate scientists[bold]?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Question 4:  Can any of the areas of the science now be considered settled as a result of AR5’s publication, if so wh[bold]ich?  What areas need further effort to reduce the levels of uncertainty?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Question 5:  How effective is AR5 and the summary for policymakers in conveying what is meant by unce[bold]rtainty in scientific terms?  Would a focus on risk rather than uncertainty be useful?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Question 6:  Does the AR5 address the reliability of climate [bold]models?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Question 7:  Has AR5 sufficiently explained the reasons behind the widely [bold]reported hiatus in the global surface temperature record?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Question 9:  Is the IPCC process an effective mechanism for assessing scientific knowledge?  Or has it focussed on providing a justification for political commitmen[bold]t?[bold]&#xa0;
