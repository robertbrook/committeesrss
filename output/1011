[normal]Question One: What are the historical and philosophical justifications for denying prisoners the right to vote?
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Question Two: Why is the right to vote considered to be a human right?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]Question Three: Is disqualifying prisoners from voting a suitable part of their punishment?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Question Four: What are the financial implications of maintaining the current ban in terms of claims by prisoners for compensation?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Question Five: Is sentence length a legally robust basis on which to retain an entitlement to vote?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Question Six: What would be the likely legal consequences, both domestically and internationally of:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a) keeping the law as it is? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]b) passing legislation giving some prisoners the right to vote, but in a way that maintains a form of blanket restriction?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]c) seeking to comply by enfranchising the minimum number of prisoners possible consistent with our international legal obligations?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Question Seven: Would giving prisoners the right to vote have any significant administrative impact on either the prison system or the Electoral Commission?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Question Eight: Is there any evidence to suggest that allowing prisoners to vote would have a significant impact on particular constituencies?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Question Nine: What lessons can be drawn from the experience of other countries regarding prisoner voting? 
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal] 
[normal] Please note that I am not suggesting that disenfranchisement is somehow “equal” to a year imprisonment - this is just a hypothetical example to illustrate the point that tying disenfranchisement to sentence length might be legally dubious, as it might result in disproportionate punishments.
