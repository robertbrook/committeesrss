defaultWritten submission from the National Outsourcing Association (LPG 21)default&#xa0;defaultExecutive SummarydefaultIt is the 
defaultNational Outsourcing Association’s (
defaultNOA
default)
default contention that an entirely new approach
default to outsourcing 
defaultneeds to be established within the public sector to bring about significant improvements in procured services over the long term
default, as well as to aid the UK economy
default.
defaultAlthough outsourcing is not directly mentioned in the Committee’s call for evidence, £82bn of outsourced services are provided to the public sector each year, which we believe makes outsourcing highly relevant.
default Further to that, 
defaultOxford Economics in April 2011 estimated that turnover across all ‘outsourced’ markets amounts to some £207 billion per annum, equivalent to some 8.0% of economy-wide output. The private/public sector split is approx
defaultimately
default 60%/40%.
default The UK outsourcing industry supports 3.3 million jobs and 
defaultcontributes £28.5 billion to the Treasury each year.
default It is a significant and growing industry in the UK, yet it gets castigated more than praised, oft because it becomes the scapegoat for some other failure.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe truth is ‘outsourcing works’, when done right. E
defaultvidence
default suggests
default that outsourcing can lead to savings of between 15
default%
default and 30%.  If we conservatively assume effective outsourcing delivers savings of 10
default% that amounts to a saving on £82bn of services, of £8
default.2bn
default per annum
default.
defaultBut it only works, when it’s the right solution for the given scenario and when it’s done
default well
default. 
defaultIt seems clear to many that the skills and culture that are required for outsourcing to work consistently well in the public sector simply do not exist.
default The NOA’s recommendations are:
defaultThe NOA can help through qualification and accreditation and we propose 
defaultall public bodies review their sourcing practices against the NOA best practice Life Cycle and 
defaultover time
default 
defaultachieve and 
defaultmaintain 
defaultaccreditation for

default We also promote the development of shared best practice and call on Government to start voicing support for this essential and burgeoning industry.
