[normal]Written submission from the National Outsourcing Association (LPG 21)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Executive Summary[bold]It is the 
[normal]National Outsourcing Association’s (
[normal]NOA
[normal])
[normal] contention that an entirely new approach
[normal] to outsourcing 
[normal]needs to be established within the public sector to bring about significant improvements in procured services over the long term
[normal], as well as to aid the UK economy
[normal].
[normal]Although outsourcing is not directly mentioned in the Committee’s call for evidence, £82bn of outsourced services are provided to the public sector each year, which we believe makes outsourcing highly relevant.
[normal] Further to that, 
[normal]Oxford Economics in April 2011 estimated that turnover across all ‘outsourced’ markets amounts to some £207 billion per annum, equivalent to some 8.0% of economy-wide output. The private/public sector split is approx
[normal]imately
[normal] 60%/40%.
[normal] The UK outsourcing industry supports 3.3 million jobs and 
[normal]contributes £28.5 billion to the Treasury each year.
[normal] It is a significant and growing industry in the UK, yet it gets castigated more than praised, oft because it becomes the scapegoat for some other failure.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The truth is ‘outsourcing works’, when done right. E
[normal]vidence
[normal] suggests
[normal] that outsourcing can lead to savings of between 15
[normal]%
[normal] and 30%.  If we conservatively assume effective outsourcing delivers savings of 10
[normal]% that amounts to a saving on £82bn of services, of £8
[normal].2bn
[normal] per annum
[normal].
[normal]But it only works, when it’s the right solution for the given scenario and when it’s done
[normal] well
[normal]. 
[normal]It seems clear to many that the skills and culture that are required for outsourcing to work consistently well in the public sector simply do not exist.
[normal] The NOA’s recommendations are:
[normal]The NOA can help through qualification and accreditation and we propose 
[normal]all public bodies review their sourcing practices against the NOA best practice Life Cycle and 
[normal]over time
[normal] 
[normal]achieve and 
[normal]maintain 
[normal]accreditation for 
[normal]their practices.
[normal] We also promote the development of shared best practice and call on Government to start voicing support for this essential and burgeoning industry.
