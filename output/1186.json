"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Dr Roger Sexton (TIC 001)1\n              \nI am only dealing with your third question, ‘What are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities?’\nA\n              \nBus Deregulation\n2\n              \nBuses are the\n main form of rural public transport\n.  \n  \nThe \nbiggest  \n‘\nchallenge\n’\n(I woul\nd use the word ‘problem’\n) \nis the lack of public control over bus services.   Unlike in the rest of Europe, \nmost \nBritish \nbus\n \nservices\n outside London \nare provided commercially; these ser\nvices are \nnot planned by public bodies such as a German/Swiss\n/\n Austrian Verkehrsverbund\n or a Swedish Lanstrafiken.\n3\n              \n \nIn very rural \nparts of Britain\n there may be no commercial \nbus \nservices, and the L\nocal \nAuthority \ncan \nthen \nplan the system.  \n But that\n situa\ntion is\n rather\n rare.  Usually\n in rural areas\n (eg in North Derbys\nhire\n and Nor\nt\nh Nott\ningham\ns\nhire\n) there are some commercial registration\ns\n which make a \nplanned\n \nnetwork impossible\n.   Bus deregulation\n also \nmakes integration of \nrail, bus and ferry services impossible.  This point is even more important in \nrural areas than it is in cities.\n4\n              \nAs I have said before, we need regional  PTA-type bodies covering the whole country, with control over all \nlocal \nrail, bus and ferry services\n.  See e\n.\ng\n.\n your 2012 report on \ncompetition\n in the bus industry, \nmy oral \nevidence at\n Ev\n page 14\n Q93\n.  I would add that in the Netherlands, there are PTA\n-like\n bodies controlling all local public transport\n, urban and rural.\n5\n              \n \nIn the context of cycling, w\ne a\nre constantly being exhorted to \n‘go Dutch’\n.\n \n  The same should be true of public transport.  And what do\n D\nutch cyclists do when it rains?  Or they have heavy luggage\n,\n or they want to go a long distance, perhaps to rural Friesland, or the islands off the nor\nth coast?  They use their excellent integrated  \nregulated  public transport \nnetwork.    And to pay for their\n journeys, \nthey get out their nationwide ‘O\nystercard’,  the  \n‘OV Chipkaart’\n. \n \n6\n              \nYes, \none smartcard for the whole country, both urban and rural\n and \nvalid on all forms of public tr\na\nnsport\n!  \nContrast the situation here in urban Nottingham where there are now \nthree incompatible smartcard systems in one city\n – and that is just for buses\n!\n  (Trams and trains are not covered.)\nB \n              \nSenior Bus Passes\n7\n              \n \nA\n second major\n problem is the distorting effect of Senior bus passes.  Seniors living in rural areas insist on bus services \n(timetabled to leave their village after 09 30) \nso they can use their free passes.  They reject rail, ferry or\n shared taxis.  That is\n nonsensical\n.\n8\n              \nI would not extend the free bus pass to other forms of \npublic \ntransport. \n  Rather I would replace it with a smart card ‘purse’ valid on all forms of public transport \n.\n  I would suggest an annual value of £520, (£10 per week.).  There would,\n of course, have to be legislation imposing a uniform smart card system on all operators of public transport.  \nSee\n my written evidence to the 2012 enquiry, page \nEv \n75 para\ngraph\n 15\n, but note paragraph 6 above.\n9\n              \nThere might be a case for the smart card \n‘pur\nse’ to be larger for\n Seniors living in rural \nareas\n \na long way from the nearest \nlarge \ntown\n.  \nHowever\n,\n another advantage of public transport being  controlled by a PTA is that the PTA sets the fares.  We must put an end to the absurd situation \nwhere one sect\nor of the rural\n population\n can make unlimited journeys ‘to town’ for nothing, while other sectors (particularly the young and the unemployed) have to pay very high fares.\n  We can only do that by (both) ending bus deregulation and putting some upper limit o\nn the use of Senior bus passes.\n \nJuly 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
