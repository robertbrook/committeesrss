[[[Submission to the Joint Committee on t]]]

[[[he Draft Deregulation Bill  on Behalf of the Speaker’s Committee on the Electoral Commission]]]&#xa0;The Electoral Commission (EC) and the Local Government Boundary Commission England (LGBCE) have approached the Speaker’s Committee seeking its support for amendments to the statutory governance arrangements set out in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 and the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009 respectively.&#xa0;The changes sought are as follows.&#xa0;1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To enable both organisations to appoint a maximum of two lay members to their committees and sub-committees, most particularly their Audit Committees. Such a change would be consistent  with current recognised best practice - currently&#xa0;the statutes restrict committee membership to Commissioners only;2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To introduce a more flexible regime for the production of value for money reports on the organisations by the NAO – the statutes currently require a report on each organisation to be produced once a year; and,3)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Similarly, to introduce a more flexible regime for the production of five-year plans, which must currently be produced annually for examination by the Committee.&#xa0; &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Membership of Audit Committees]]].&#xa0;The current provisions appear in paragraph 8 of Schedule 1 to the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (EC) and paragraph 5 of Schedule 1 to the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009 (LGBCE).&#xa0;At present, committees of both the Electoral Commission and the LGBCE must be made up of Commissioners alone.  Both organisations wish to be able to appoint an independent person, with relevant skills and experience, to their audit committee in line with current Treasury guidance on audit committees.&#xa0;The Electoral Commission has also proposed that it might be provided with powers to include independent members on other committees, such as the remuneration committee.  The LGBCE has confirmed that it is not seeking statutory powers to include independent members on any committee other than its audit committee.  &#xa0;The Electoral Commission believes that the appointment of independent committee members should be a matter for the Commission itself, and such members should not have any statutory restrictions on their formal participation in committees. &#xa0;The Committee is broadly supportive of these proposals and recognises the benefit of best practice being applied to the two bodies. The Committee considers that:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Frequency of value for money reports]]]&#xa0;The current provisions appear in paragraph 16 of Schedule 1 to the PPERA 2000 (EC) and paragraph 13 of Schedule 1 to the LDEDCA 2009 (LGBCE). The Speaker’s Committee is required, under the legislation, to receive such reports, and to have regard to the most recent in its examination of the organisations’ estimates and five-year plans.  At present, the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;AG) is required by statute to examine each organisation annually. The C&amp;AG has written to the Committee indicating that he would support a reduction in the frequency of value for money studies, believing that an annual study is disproportionate to the size and spending power of the EC and LGBCE.&#xa0; The Committee considers a statutory annual value for money study may be disproportionate for small organisations such as the EC and LGBCE. The Committee has agreed that a reduction in the frequency of value for money reports would provide modest savings to the NAO as well as the EC and LGBCE at little risk of detriment to the taxpayer. The Committee recommends, therefore, that:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Five year plans]]]&#xa0;Current provision appears in paragraph 15 of Schedule 1 to the PPERA 2000 (EC) and paragraph 12 of Schedule 1 to the LDEDCA 2009 (LGBCE). At present both organisations are required annually to produce a new five-year plan for approval by the Committee, in consultation with HM Treasury.  The Committee has agreed, in principle, that annual scrutiny of the medium-term strategy and financial forecasts is disproportionate.  Treasury officials have indicated that they would be content with a more ‘light touch’ regime.  The proposed changes would alter the frequency of reports but leave other details of the process unchanged.&#xa0;The Committee has agreed the proposal in principle and that:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The Committee recognises that the annual production of vfm reports and five-year-plans may represent an unnecessary cost and these proposed changes would provide a modest saving for the NAO as well as the EC and LGBCE with little risk of detriment to the taxpayer. &#xa0;The Committee understands that these changes will require primary legislation and that it is for the Government to determine a suitable legislative vehicle should it decide to give effect to these proposals. While the Committee understands that the Deregulation Bill may transpire not to be an appropriate legislative vehicle, it has received advice on possible amendments to the draft bill, which are appended to this submission.  The amendments do not explicitly deal with the Speaker’s Committee’s power to commission vfm studies not linked to five year plans nor specify that external members on a sub-committee need not be members of a main committee: our understanding is that this level of detail is unnecessary.&#xa0;1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To enable both organisations to appoint a lay members  to their committees and sub-committees, most particularly their Audit Committees. Such a change would be consistent  with current recognised best practice - currently&#xa0;the statutes restrict committee membership to Commissioners only;2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To introduce a more flexible regime for the production of value for money reports on the organisations by the NAO – the statutes currently require a report on each organisation to be produced once a year; and,3)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Similarly, to introduce a more flexible regime for the production of five-year plans, which must currently be produced annually for examination by the Committee.&#xa0; &#xa0;
