These are:\n2.4\n              \nThrough the delivery of these three services, New Charter has a detailed working knowledge of working with homeless \nhou\nseholds\n. All three services work closely with \nthe local authorities they are contract\ned\n to, \nand\n ensure best practice performance, value for money and a reduction in overall costs.\n2.5\n              \nKnowsley and Tameside have had considerable success in the past 2 years \nin reducing the overall cost of temporary accommodation, both to DWP and the local authority.\n2.6\n              \nBased on our analysis of the impact of the current proposals, we have serious concerns over the impact on homeless households, as well as the financial impact\n on local authorities. We \nurge the DWP to consider the regional implications of the current proposals to avoid significantly increased costs\n3.0&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMonthly Anniversary Assessments3.1\n              \nThe assessment of the housing element of universal credit on the anniversary of the claim (thereby in monthly cycles) represents one of our biggest areas of concern, and \nof the greatest potential increase in\n costs to DWP and local authorities if implemente\nd as currently proposed.\n3.2\n              \nWe are aware that Homeless Link has already developed a number of examples of how this will impact on individuals.  We can see no practical way of working within these proposals that will not lead to increased costs for DWP and\n to the Local Authority.\n3.3\n              \nIn\n Tameside and Knowsley our use B&amp;Bs is limited to statutory duty where no other suitable options are available, and for the minimum period of stay in order to reduce costs to DWP and the Authority.\n3.4\n              \nWithin Tameside, B&amp;B is\n used as a last resort for those unable to move into short term supported accommodation.  Households are moved to lower cost accommodation at the first available opportunity.  \nIn Knowsley the current temporary accommodation model is B &amp; B for the majority \nof placements.  \nAverage weekly cost \nof\n B&amp;B in Tameside in 2013 is £\n967 per household\n and in Knowsley is £504 per household\n. \n3.5\n              \nIn order to ensure that the housing costs are taken into account, \nauthorities\n will have no option but to increase length of stay until after the anniversary of the claim.  For households making a new claim on the day of placement, this will be a full calendar month.  For those who have an existing claim, the period until the next a\nnniversary could be up to 8 weeks.\n3.6\n              \nThe need to ensure rental costs are met through the housing element, leading to a need to increase length of stay will mean that households will remain in high cost B&amp;B accommodation even after more suitable, lower co\nst accommodation has become available, or where the council’s statutory duty has ended.  \n3.7\n              \nIn 2012-13, t\nhe a\nverage length of stay \nper household \nin \nTameside \nwas \n7\n days, at an average cost of \n£165\n per placement\n.  \nThe increased length of stay in order to a\nllow for the housing assessment to take place \nwould mean an increase of £\n1,934\n – \n£5,802\n per household, per placement.  \n3.5\n              \nE\nven where customers have been placed in B&amp;B under a statutory duty within a day of the anniversary of their claim, there will be an\n increased cost to DWP as universal credit is paid monthly in arrears.  Therefore, the customer or landlord will receive benefits relating to housing they may have only occupied for a matter of days.  The same will be true where customers move from higher \ncost accommodation (such as B&amp;B) into social or private sector housing at a much lower cost.  The Housing Element relating to the high cost accommodation will continue to be paid until after the anniversary of the claim, again leading to greater cost to DW\nP.\n4.0              Benefit Cap4.1\n              \nThe current proposals to apply the benefit cap to households living in temporary accommodation will negatively impact on households who have been placed in higher cost accommodation, such as hostels or B&amp;B.  As the duty to secure tem\nporary accommodation under homelessness legislation is an absolute, there are occasions where placement in higher cost accommodation is unavoidable where no other suitable accommodation is available. The legislation and case law surrounding affordability i\nn regards to intentional homelessness means that the additional cost of this accommodation will necessarily fall to the local authority.\n4.2\n              \nFor example, in Tameside the weekly cost of a single person in B&amp;B is £\n239\n and for a family is £\n434\n.  This leaves a\n shortfall of £\n149\n or £\n313\n respectively.  In Knowsley the costs \nof a single person in B &amp; B is £\n280\n and for a family is £\n504\n.  This leaves a shortfall of £\n190 or £383 respectively\n.\n The authority could require the household to make up this shortfall themselves, if they have the means to do so.  The likelihood is however, that a benefit dependant family would not have the means to meet this cost without a negative impact on essential \nliving costs.  This would be particularly true where households have been placed in B&amp;B and food costs will therefore be higher due to the inability to cook.  The household would therefore fall into arrears on their accommodation costs and be evicted from \ntheir accommodation.  However, as the accommodation was unaffordable to them, the local authority would still retain a duty to secure temporary accommodation for them.  The only practical solution for an authority would be to meet the cost of the shortfall\n for the duration of the placement.  This would increase the non-recoverable costs \nto be paid by the authority.  \n4.3\n              \nIn Knowsley this increase would be a \n14\n% \nweekly \nrise on 2012-13 costs\n and 16% rise in Tameside\n.  If the current proposals for housing elem\nent assessments are also \nimplemented, \nthe combination of increased length of stay and increased non recoverable costs could lead to an annual increase in non-recoverable costs of\n over 2000%\n in Tameside alone. \n5.0              Universal Credit5.1\n              \nWe are relieved to se\ne that under the current proposals additional management costs relating to temporary accommodation will be met through Discretionary Housing Payments, \nensuring that universal credit will not be a bar to using temporary accommodation for universal credit cl\naimants.  However, \nwe have serious concerns regarding the practical implications of placing customer in temporary ac\ncommodation on universal credit for both the claimant and the services supporting them.\n5.2\n              \nTemporary accommodation is by its nature short t\nerm and households may make a number of moves within a short period before suitable long term accommodation is secured.  For example, where a customer is accepted as homeless in one authority but has no local connection and so the duty is transferred to an\nother authority, the customer would be required to move to accommodation in the accepting authority area.  In Tameside and Knowsley customers placed in high cost accommodation may be required to move into lower cost accommodation when it becomes available,\n or may be moved into more accommodation more suitable to their needs (such as due to area or support needs) or for housing management issues.\n5.3\n              \nCosts for each accommodation may vary greatly.  Customers under universal credit would be expected to notify \nof a change of circumstances upon moving, as well as to manage their finances to ensure the correct rents are paid to the landlords of each accommodation, and that any underspend is retained to be repaid to DWP in the event of an over payment or to be used\n to meet costs of higher rents where claims have not yet been processed.  We believe that this is too much to expect of households in crisis and will lead to claimants being subject to sanctions or facing further homelessness where housing costs are not me\nt.\n5.4\n              \nIf managed payments to landlords were to be retained, this would reduce the hardship to the household, however \nwould increase the workload and resource needs for local authorities.  In order to ensure that correct claims and notifications have been \nmade to universal credit, and to reconcile monthly payments in arrears to the rents paid to the landlords we anticipate that homelessness and housing advice services will need to employ additional staff.  In Tameside and Knowsley, which are small authoriti\nes with a low number of temporary accommodation placements per quarter, we anticipate an additional member of staff for each service would be required to meet this need.  This would create an additional cost to the authorities of £\n30,000\n \neach.  Multiplied \nby each authority area and factoring in larger authorities \nwith large numbers of placements, this would create a significant additional cost for local authorities to meet in order to ensure households living in temporary accommodation are not faced with fu\nrther homelessness or benefit sanctions.\n6.0              Size Criteria 6.1\n              \nUnder the current proposals, customers living in temporary accommodation owned by the local authority are not exempt from the social sector size criteria, although those in most other types of\n temporary accommodation are.\n6.2\n              \nKnowsley Council are currently developing a dispersed model of temporary \naccommodation. Properties will at time be under occupied in line with the size criteria and therefore result in a short fall for the occupier, who ar\ne benefit dependent and would not have the means to meet the shortfall\n7.0              Managed payment of Rent to Landlords7.1\n              \nWe are pleased that DWP is currently seeking views as to whether people receiving Universal Credit and living in temporary accommodation hav\ne their rent paid straight to the landlords.  \nO\nur view\n is \nthat it is \nessential that the current arrangements of direct payment to landlords \nare\n maintained.\n7.2\n              \nOur reasons for this are:\n8.0              Further options to consider8.1\n              \nIf the current proposals for monthly assessments of claims and change of circumstances are implemente\nd\n, local authorities could consider a number of options:\n8.2\n              \nThe fundamental disadvantage to these options is that, in order to ensure the rental costs are \ncove\nred;\n authorities will be required to place households until their first anniversary of their claim, leading to an increased length of stay and cost to local authorities and DWP\n.\n8.3\n              \nAnother option for local authorities would be to use 6 month ASTs in the p\nrivate rented sector in order to discharge temporary accommodation duty.  We understand that this is common practice in some of the southern local authorities.  This would resolve many of the issues around managed payments to landlords and the benefit cap.\n  We have 2 practical concerns regarding the operational logistics of implementing this where it is not already in practice:\n8.4\n              \nAuthorities could consider commissioning a\ndditional exempt accommodation to use as temporary accommodation.  Given that budgets for 2013-14 have now been set, this would not be viable without grant funding from DCLG.  In addition, under the current proposals for social size criteria and benefit ca\nps, authorities may be concerned that such schemes would not be cost viable. In addition, the need to keep customers in accommodation for a minimum of 4 weeks in order to ensure housing element is met would mean that such schemes could not be used for cris\nis bed spaces, leaving authorities needing to use B&amp;B to meet statutory temporary accommodation duties.\n9.0              Recommendations for Action&#xa0;\n10 September 2013\n8\n&#xa0;\n"
