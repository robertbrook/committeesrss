"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by EDF Energy (WSC056)&#xa0;\nAbout EDF Energy\n&#xa0;EDF Energy is one of the UK’s largest energy companies with activities throughout the energy chain. \n \nWe provide 50% of the UK\n’s low carbon generation. \n \nOur interests include nuclear, coal and gas-fired electricity generation, renewables, and energy supply to end users. \n \nWe have over five million electricity and gas customer accounts in the UK, including both residential and \nbusiness users.\n&#xa0;\nEDF Energy’s safe and secure operation of its eight existing nuclear power stations at sites across the country makes it the UK’s largest generator of low carbon electricity. \n \nEDF Energy is also leading the UK's nuclear renaissance and has\n published plans to build four new nuclear plants, subject to the right investment framework. \n \nThese new plants could generate enough low carbon electricity for about 40% of Britain’s homes.\n&#xa0;\nEDF Energy is part of EDF Group, one of Europe’s largest power c\nompanies. \n \nThe company employs around 15,000 people at locations across the UK.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Diversity &amp; Inclusion at EDF Energy\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Building our future capability \n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Why do numbers of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder?\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDiagram 1 -\n \nThe Proportion of female new registrants into the Engineering Council\n&#xa0;2.\n              \nSignificant progress has been made towards increasing the diversity of recruitment intakes across the Engineering industry e.g. 23% of EDF Energy new hires into our engineering business in 2012 were women (the UK talent pool indicates that approximately le\nss than 15% of STEM graduates in the UK are women). \n \nWomen currently within our organisation also show increasing engagement on our annual employee survey year-on-year; 2013 engagement scores of women within our engineering business at the highest aggregat\ne level show positive engagement of 89% (this is higher than the non-gender general UK benchmark of 72%).\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.\n              \nWith the steady influx of women into STEM careers, one might expect that this talent pipeline would show a continuous (but perhaps gradual) increase when moving further through an organisation’s management structure. \n \nIndeed, focused research and examinati\non of internal practices at EDF Energy has highlighted that within the first 10 years of a STEM career there is no discernable difference in the rate of progression of men and women. \n \nOutput from internal focus groups also showed that women in the organisa\ntion did not perceive barriers to progression directly related to gender. \n \nHowever, it was also highlighted that some women were making a conscious decision not to progress into leadership roles, and we are exploring further their reasons behind this.\n&#xa0;\n4.\n              \nThere was some evidence in the focus groups that some women were uncomfortable with actions that might be perceived as positive discrimination when progressing their careers: particularly communications which could be construed as target or goal setting ag\nainst numbers of women.  \nHowever, it was widely agreed that the biggest enabler to ensuring women are keen to progress into leadership careers within the company was flexibility.\n&#xa0;\n5.\n              \nThis was mainly in terms of role design and ‘ways of working’ within some\n of our management routines. It was also suggested to include more flexibility in terms of career paths and the means of gaining development for the necessary experience required in senior roles (e.g. a flexible approach to mobility: recognizing that indiv\niduals may have varying degrees of mobility at different life stages). \n \nAligned with this they highlighted the need for transparency and open communication: to ensure a level of fairness across the business and to assist them with more effective career and\n development planning.\n \n It is also worth noting that the focus groups highlighted that male employees also sought increased flexibility.  \n&#xa0;\n6.\n              \nMapping forward the % of women in our engineering workforce, proportions of female talent would grow from 13% to \n18% in 10 years, with the % of female managers growing from 9% to 15% if progress is accelerated. \n \nWe are currently working across the company to evaluate our ways of working and how to build further flexibility into job designs.\n&#xa0;When women leave \nacademia, what careers do they transition into? What are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in different employment sectors?\n&#xa0;7.\n              \nIt is of critical importance to EDF Energy that we continue to build the diversity of our w\norkforce. \n \nEmployees who feel valued and respected are more likely to be highly motivated and committed, and more likely to perform better.\n \n It is also important that our workforce reflects our communities and customers, leading to a better understanding o\nf our customers.\n&#xa0;\n8.\n              \nIn their ‘The State of Engineering 2013’ report, Engineering UK reported that ‘over two thirds (68.3%) of male first degree graduates went into an engineering and technology occupation. \n \nThe comparable figure for women was 51.1%. Conve\nrsely, just under a third (30.2%) of males went into a non-STEM career, compared with 45.1% of women’. \n \nThis trend can be seen to impact the diversity of EDF Energy’s Engineering and Science graduates. \n \nOf the 2013 graduate intake, 24% are female. \n \nThis un\nder-representation is evident from application stage, with 23% of applications coming from females.\n \n Given that 15.3% of 2009 Engineering degree starters were female, an application rate of less than 25% is perhaps not surprising, but it is essential that \nthe representation of females in Engineering and Science graduate schemes increases.\n&#xa0;\n9.\n              \nEDF Energy \nis\n therefore working to attract greater numbers of applications from female STEM graduates, including organisation of targeted events for female undergradua\ntes, the development of relationships between EDF Energy’s Women’s Network and university networks, and ensuring that the diversity of our workforce is reflected in the material we use with prospective employees.\n&#xa0;What should universities and the higher ed\nucation sector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice?\n&#xa0;10.\n              \nAt Higher Education level, female participation in STEM varies greatly between and within subject areas. \n \nThe figure below shows the\n gender breakdown of applicants for 2007/08. \n \nComputer Science (15% female participation) and Engineering (12% female participation) are indicated as having the lowest proportion of female applicants within STEM, with engineering remaining static at around\n 12% over the last six years.\nDiagram 2 - \nApplications to STEM subjects at HE level (segregated by Gender)\n&#xa0;11.\n              \nAs an industry that requires a skill-specific workforce, university education and applied engineering courses are valuable to ensuring that the future engineering workforce is equipped. \n \nIt is critical that the engineering and higher education sectors atte\nmpt to increase participation from female students at this level and retain it through greater engagement at the academic level.\n&#xa0;\n12.\n              \nMany UK engineering companies have female focused employee networks that are helping to drive change in the female make-up\n of engineering industry.\n \n Partnerships between universities and employee networks are an area for investigation.\n \n For example, the chair of EDF Energy’s Women’s network recently spoke at a careers event for women held at University College London, and we \nare exploring further opportunities in this area. Women’s Employee Networks could work in partnership with universities in terms of sponsoring candidates, mentoring students, breaking down gender perceptions of the engineering industry, and providing visib\nility of senior females as role models.\n \n This will help retain women within academia, and increase their desire to stay within STEM.\n&#xa0;\n13.\n              \n The appropriate use of role models has been widely recognised as a successful tool to increasing female participation in STEM careers, the key challenge therefore lies in reaching large numbers.\n \n STEMNET’s 20,000 STEM ambassadors (of whom 40% are female) \nis an appropriate successful programme; of those ambassadors who have an engineering background and/or career, 25% are female (and 80% of these are under 35).\n \n Increasing the numbers of females attending and participating in various STEM related initiative\ns is a pre-requisite to affecting attitudes. \n \nEDF Energy actively promotes STEMNET to all employees, including new graduate and apprentice starters, and recently offered Public Speaking training to its STEM ambassadors.\n&#xa0;\n14.\n              \nEDF Energy has coordinated and \ncontributed to wide a range of events and initiatives for younger generations, children from age \nsix\n, to change the way children think about STEM. \n \nThese include general events, for example \nEDF\n \nEnergy \nis principal Education sponsor of the Cheltenham Science Festival, and helped further its outreach to 250 students from schools in Somerset through a ‘careering Around’ session. \n \nFollowing a ‘speed-dating’ format, pupils got the chance to question young sc\nientists and engineers about their jobs and talk informally about what it is really like to work in industry. \n \nThe session aimed to help young people consider science subjects in a fun and engaging way, ahead of making career choices at A-Level.\n&#xa0;\n15.\n              \nWe ha\nve also targeted some of our early careers outreach specifically towards younger women. \n \nOur ‘Inspire’ Programme encourages young girls to get involved in STEM subjects and helps to open their eyes to pathways and careers in our industry. \n \nThe ‘Women into \nEngineering and Construction’ is a progressive programme starting in year \neight\n, which takes cohorts of girls through an interactive STEM related experience over a \nthree\n year period. \n \nThis is run through our partnership with Bridgwater College, Somerset.\n&#xa0;\n16.\n              \nAt a later stage in career pathway, we run the ‘Access to Apprentice’ scheme which gives a foundation year of educational tuition to those who may not normally choose to follow an apprentice route. \n \nAlthough the programme is not targeted at women, we h\nave tended to have a higher intake of girls. \n&#xa0;\n17.\n              \nOther ways in which we are working to attract female talent to our organisation is to highlight female role models from the organisation externally, in order to showcase the opportunities available. \n \nRecen\ntly one of our female apprentices featured in \nThe \nDaily \nMirror\n alongside information on careers in the industry. \n&#xa0;What role should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers?\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTable 1\n – A* - C pass rates for selected GCSE subjects, 2009 (UK)\n&#xa0;\n19.\n              \nIt is essential that all students are provided with quality careers guidance from ages 14 – 18, when the choices of A-Level and degree subjects are made. \n \nThis careers guidance must come from both educational institutions and employers in the engineering s\nector. \n \nGovernmental policy and practice that supports the provision of this careers guidance is essential.  \n&#xa0;\n20.\n              \nThe creation of female role models in Engineering is also of critical importance.  The understanding of, and engagement in, their field of sc\nience has improved significantly in recent years, largely due to the popularisation of role models such as Prof Brian Cox through national media.  There is less understanding and awareness of engineers and engineering careers, and therefore nation-wide pro\nmotion of key female role models in this field would significantly help develop interest in careers in the Engineering field.\n&#xa0;\n21.\n              \nThe development of local role models is supported largely by the STEM Ambassador programme of schools intervention.\n \n STEM Ambassadors significantly improve the accessibility of STEM professions to students of all ages, and increase awareness of the variety of careers and \nopportunities available to engineers or all backgrounds.  It is of critical importance that this pro\ngramme continues to be supported and grown within the UK.\n&#xa0;Conclusion\n&#xa0;\n22.\n              \nEDF Energy is making progress in working to widen actively the pool of talent from which we recruit. \n \nWhile we have seen progress in increasing the number of female entrants to our \nSTEM areas (such as the nuclear science and engineering graduate scheme and apprentice scheme), we recognise that there is more still that we, as a company, and as an industry, can do.\n&#xa0;\n13.\n              \nWe would highlight the significant of using positive role models t\no attract women into STEM careers, and how targeted marketing STEM opportunities (both through role models and also through using specific recruitment channels such as at targeted university events) has increased the number of applications from women.\n \n We \nmust always recruit the best person for the role, however\n,\n widening our pool enables high-potential females to join an industry they may not have previously considered. \n&#xa0;\n24.\n              \nIt is important for Government and industry to work together to increase the enga\ngement of female students at all academic stages of their STEM careers. \n \nThe promotion of STEM through female role models, sound career advice, and increasing the visibility of the engineering sector as a career prospect for women will he\nlp us achieve our \ncommon goals.\n&#xa0;September 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
