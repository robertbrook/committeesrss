[[[Written evidence submitted by Nathalie Junker]]]&#xa0;I am writing as an individual parent who is concerned about the lack of school places in her area.&#xa0;When Mr Gove introduced his academies programme, he informed us that this programme – amongst other things – would address the shortage of school places. Instead, the shortage has got worse. I live in an area in outer London where the shortage is getting worse, rather than better. Academies – forced or other - do nothing to create additional capacity! However, at the same times Local Authorities, who still bear the statutory responsibility for offering a school place to every child in their borough have had their hands tied and their budgets slashed when it comes to creating new school places. Indeed, the fact that  Councils across London are left with only one option of creating new school places, that of expanding existing schools, is creating problems in other areas, namely over-crowding of playgrounds which then impacts on children's academic performance as well as adding to the obesity problem. In short, Mr Gove's policies are not only failing to address the shortage of school places, but they are making the problem worse.&#xa0;In the area of North London where I live, we have an acute shortage of primary and secondary places. Though one local secondary is now an academy, this has done nothing to create new places in the area. Not one new school, be it a free school or an academy, has opened to address the shortage, and the Council is struggling to keep up with demand.&#xa0;The current education policy is a short-sighted ideological pet project of one man who thinks he knows it all and is leading straight to the abyss. Britain does not need six different types of schools, nor does it need competition in the education sector. What it needs one kind of school offering a good standard of education across the board, not just to those who can afford it. &#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
