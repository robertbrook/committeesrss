defaultWritten evidence from Suffolk Coastal District Council (SRN 031)
defaultHow does the Government’s policy for roads link with planning for other transport modes?
defaultThe evidence from the recent process in 
defaultregard to the planning for the A14
default toll road
default in 
defaultCamb
defaultridge
defaultshire
default indicates that the HA has taken no accoun
defaultt whatsoever of the s
defaulttrategic relevance or impact of this major scheme, relating it to and presenting it solely as a local congestion relief scheme for 
defaultthe Cambridge and Huntingdon area. As evidence of the Government’s policy in action, it is appears to indicate that the policy environment is not fit for purpose. 
defaultThis is not inconsistent with previous episodes in rel
defaulta
defaulttion to the HA and other issues on th
defaulte A14. 
defaultExamples are the difficul
defaultties some 6 or 7
default years ago in rela
defaulttion to ‘Operation Stack’, the process to ac

defaulto
defaultmmodat

defaultcongestion
default on the A14 in 
defaultthe
default event of closure of

defaultPort.
default The HA’s approach was 
defaultexceedingly
default 
defaultineffective
default in 
defaultrelation
default 
defaultto
default the feasibility of various options, 
defaultespecially
default in respect to the 
defaultimpact
default on local 
defaultroads
default and communities. A workable solution was eventually found, almost 
defaultentirely
default from the 
defaultinput
default and efforts of Suffolk 
defaultCounty
default Council, Suffolk Coastal 
defaultDistrict
default Cou
defaultncil, the 
defaultPort
default of 
defaultFelixstowe
default and the police. 
defaultGovernment
default policy, as 
defaultevidenced
default by the HA’s 
defaultapproach
default 
defaultappeared
default to be based on the concept of the Trunk Road being a separate and standalone entity,  unrelated to local circumstances. 
defaultSimilar considerations appli
defaulted to the design of improvement at Dock Spur Roundabout 
defaultFelixstowe
default and the 
defaultCopdock
default Interchange. 
defaultThe designs in 
defaultthose
default cases, while 
defaultperforming
default excellently in their core role, were not permitted to take into account possible related 
defaultimprovements
default on the immedi
defaultately 
defaultadjoining
default roads.
defaultOther examples could be quoted, but these are sufficient to indicate that there needs to be a fundamental rethink of the approach to integrating policy and opportunities on the trunk and local road systems
defaultHow should the Highways Age
defaultncy be reformed to make it “the world’s leading highway operator”? What roles should Government and the private sector play to ensure better management of the strategic road network?
defaultThe HA appears to operate in total isolation from all other local agencie
defaults, let alone communities. Many other 
defaultgovernment
default agencies, 
defaultfor example, The
default 
defaultEnvironment
default 
defaultA
defaultgency and Natural England, 
defaultand
default many others
default,
default have moved an 
defaultenormous distan
defaultce over r
defaultecent years in correcting previ
defaultous
defaultl
defaulty similar, although none as 
defaultextreme
default, stances. 
defaultThe 
defaultHA howe
defaultver seems impervious to such evolutions. 
defaultThe HA also appears to have no concept whatsoever of cost-effectiveness. 
defaultThe design standar
defaultds f
defaultor
default trunk roads such as the A14 have over the past decade 
defaultbecome more and more stringent and grandiose, 
defaultmeaning
default t
defaulthat schemes conceived for example a decade ago, become hugely more expensive, or indeed unaffordable, when reworked “to modern standards”. What the country needs are many new or updated roads, implemented in a much more modest and cost-effective way, so al
defaultlowing many more schemes to be actually implemented, and hence greatly improving the collective ‘return on investment’ for the government (or indeed other funding sources).
defaultAn example of this was the implementation of the long and desperately needed 
defaultimprov
defaultement
default at 
defaultHaughl
defaulte
defaulty
default, on the A14 near 
defaultStowmarket
default. The new interchange built there, for a minor 
defaultlocal
default 
defaultroad
default, was of a 
defaultstandard
default which would do justice to a full motorway junction at a major 
defaultinterchange
default for a 
defaultb
defaulti
defaultg
default city. The land take alone was

defaultsatisfactory

defaultinterchanges
default dating fro
defaultm
default the A14’s 
defaultoriginal
default 
defaultconstruction
default in the 1980
defaults. 
defaultThe HA’s 
defaultproject
default 
defaultmanagement
default has certainly never impressed with its apparent cost-effectiveness. The 
defaultinstallation
default of the overhead sign system along the A14 
defaultwas
default 
defaultmost
default 
defaultwelcome
default. B
defaultu
defaultt the time taken (
defaultaround
default two years) was hard to understand. Indeed, after many months of construction of the ducting 
defaultetc
default, and the 
defaultsigns
default 
defaultthemselves
default, they stood 
defaultunused
default for 
defaultapproaching
default a year befo
defaultre being commissioned and coming into use. 
defaultAlso, when it was suggested to the HA, that, if it was necessary to construct the data and power ducts for the length of the A14, there could be an opportunity to offer capacity in those ducts to telecoms provider
defaults or others, 
defaultand procure thereby an income stream, 
defaultthe suggestion appeared to shock the HA representative as being utterly inappropriate. 
defaultThe HA 
defaultshould
default, be required to 
defaultoperate with the same degree of cost effectiveness and efficiency
default that has been force
defaultd o
defaultn Local Authorities and other government departments.
defaultSimilarly, it should be required to undertake a fundamental revision of its policy and approach in relation to local agencies and communities – the concept know
defaultn
default elsewhere as ‘localism’. Again the recen
defaultt process
default i
defaultn respect of the A14 toll road has illustrated how out of touch it is – to the point where place names on the consultation leaflet are actually incorrect.

defaultDfT
default Circular 02/2013: THE STRATEGIC ROAD NETWORK AND THE DELIVERY OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT states: Operating an effective and efficient strategic road network makes a significant contribution to the delivery of sustainable economic growth, helping to cre
defaultate the conditions that support the realisation of the aspirations of businesses and communities, and is a key deliverable for the Highways Agency in meeting its remit of delivery partner to national economic growth. 
defaultThe recent A14 proposals are completel
defaulty contrary to this statement. We have major concerns about the way the consultation was presented 
defaultas well
default the possible consequences of the 
defaulttolling 
defaultproposals. The consultation is presented as a local congestion issue in Cambridge / Huntingdon and this view is clearly evidenced by the exhibitions all being local to that area. The regional, let alone national, aspects are mentioned only in passing and t
defaulthe so-called "Alternative Routes" are only remotely relevant or practical for local traffic, and only light vehicles. We therefore challenged the consultation and proposals at the most fundamental level. 
defaultIn summary, the HA should undergo a fundamental rev
defaultiew of its role, structure 
defaultand governance to bring it into line with current standards and policies.
