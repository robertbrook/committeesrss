"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from APSE (WRT 031)Winter MaintenanceIntroductionAPSE conducted an on-line survey during \nsummer\n 20\n13\n. A series of questions were asked covering a range of issues of interest to those officers and councillors responsible for \nwi\nnter maintenance\n services\n. \n63 responses were received \nfrom local authorities throughout the UK. This report identifies the key findings of the survey.   \n&#xa0;\nAPSE has produced a state of the market report for highways, street lighting and winter maintenance for the last 4 years and this document builds on the in\ntelligence within those, whilst concentrating on winter maintenance operations.\n&#xa0;\nContext&#xa0;The \nrecent \n3 severe winters which \nhave \nresulted in bad weather across the whole UK certainly prompted a significant response from local authorities, central government and suppliers.  \nAlthough the basic winter maintenance responsibilities focussed on keeping traffic moving on gritted roads were\n largely met by local authorities, there were some significant problems along the way. There were also elements of the service which needed to be reviewed and improved. The lack of severe winter weather over the previous 10-15 years had resulted in some lo\ncal authorities simply being out of practice in terms of this service and had lost experience in its delivery.\n&#xa0;\nThere is ample evidence that specific local authorities have invested in a number of areas in order to update their services but this is not the\n case in all. The Quarmby Review, alterations to guidance on spread rates and ‘Ploughing on – a review of highway resilience in 2013’ are examples of work done to inform and support the sector. Clearly historical levels of investment will differ between lo\ncal authorities, there will be variations in seasonal weather as well as the level of in-house experience and expertise and these factors as well as others mean some local authorities have been in a position to provide a more effective winter maintenance s\nervice than some others. Naturally there has been greater scope for some local authorities to invest and improve their services than others but this research reflects that fact that the review of winter maintenance services remains a perennial exercise.\n&#xa0;\nThe financial constraints affecting local authorities will continue into the foreseeable future and how councils react over the next few years if the weather is not as severe as it has been recently is an interesting debate. The impacts of climate change i\nncluding more snowfall and heavy rainfall mean it is vital that councils retain their capacity to deal with such incidents and the fact that emergency planning and response has a higher profile than ever means that these topics are taken seriously. More re\nasonable weather over the forthcoming winters may mean that resources are diverted away from winter services to other needy budgets leaving the service depleted when severe weather returns.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Results from the survey&#xa0;\nQ1.              How has the level of your salt stocks changed over the past 4 years?This question was asked in order to highlight both the reaction of \nlocal authorities\n to recent severe weather and the availability of salt \ni\nn the supply chain. There have been issues around supply side capacity in the mar\nketplace for obvious reasons. Mining salt is an expensive business requiring specialised machinery and large levels of investment, it is  limited to specific geographical locations and no one is really certain when\n,\n or even if\n,\n there will be a demand for t\nhe product and if it does come\n,\n the demand could  vary massively. International suppliers are an option but again their supply will be affected by the weather in their \nown \nand other countries and the attractiveness of them as suppliers\n is\n impacted by the t\nime it takes to deliver the salt by ship.\nOf the 63 responses, 50 noted that they ha\nd\n increased their level of salt stocks over the past 4 years. Some of the \nlocal authorities\n hold quite small stocks so although a small increase may be significant for thes\ne\n organisations i\nt has a negligible impact on the overall salt supply.  \nIn terms of individual \nlocal authorities, \nresponses to the level of salt they hold, 50 out of 63 or nearly 80%,\n said that they had increased their storage levels. A lot have made significant increases in their stocks, many more than50%, a number at 100% and one at 300%. The reasons for this include a desire to have enough salt to see them through a severe winter wi\nthout the need for replenishment and to be less reliant on stock management systems offered by salt suppliers. Some are looking for more regular re-stocks throughout the season. A number have built new barns or extended existing ones with the intention of \ncovering their entire stock. Others have stored extra stocks in new locations rather than retain higher stocks at existing sites.  These increases have been made in response to guidance in the Quarmby Report, from the Welsh Government or SCOTS\n/\nSGoRR.\nOf th\ne 50 that have increased stocks, 35 have increased their stocks by more than 2,000 tonnes. Clearly the stock levels can only be increased if the supply is available and the s\nup\npliers have obviously increased capacity in order to deliver extra salt over rec\nent years. This was a topic addressed the Quarmby Report and it appears that to date\n,\n suppliers have invested in order to secure improvements in the capacity delivered. \nA further 11 councils retained the same level of salt stores over the period. \nOnly 2 \ncouncils had reduced their storage levels over t\nh\ne period. Both of these councils have made changes to depots and storage arrangements resulting in less capacity.   \n&#xa0;Q2. \nHave you changed the products that you stock over this time period? If so why have they changed?With the extra snow fall and lower temperatu\nr\nes of the past few winters it would be expected that \nsome local authorities\n w\nould\n look to new products in order to maintain a good level of service and research new products\n. This is indeed what has \nbeen happening with 12 of the 63 local authorities, or 19%, who responded having changed the products that they stock. Some have changed the size of the salt they use whilst others have used new products in addition to salt and others have \nextended pre wet\n operations. Some have trialled new products but decided against their use subsequently whilst others have introduced \nthem extensively on the network. Some have started to use new products exclusively \non \nfootways and town centres. \nReasons given for some o\nf the changes include the cost of some of the products, reduced spread rates making some products uneconomic to use, the need to make savings by changing the products used and the Welsh Government matrix defining that there should be  re-treatment after ni\nne hours if sub\n-\nzero temperatures persist mean\ning\n that some products can’t be used. Another has used grit to mix with salt for grit bins and footway treatment in severe conditions.\n&#xa0;Q3. Have you changed you spread rates? If so, why?28 of the 63 responses,\n or 44%, have altered their spread rates over the last 4 years\n.  Bearing in mind updates to Chapter 13 and Appendix H of Well Maintained Highways and recommendations in the Quarmby Report, it is unsurprising that a large number of local authorities have al\ntered spread rates. This was given as the main reason for altering the rates with other reasons being growing confidence in the products used meaning rates could be reduced and the need to conserve salt at times of heavy snow fall. One reason for not alter\ning rates was that some older gritters do not have the capacity for precision adjustment.      \n&#xa0;Q4. Have you changed your storage arrangements? If so why?38 local authorities, or 60% of responses, have changed their storage arrangements. These changes include building new storage barns both in existing depots and at new depots. \nThere have been a number of new builds reflecting the level of investment in th\ne service with some councils building more than one. The alteration and extension of existing barns is also a change noted by a number of responses and putting roofs on salt bays is another example of investment.\nSheeting has been more widely adopted by lo\ncal authorities as an alternative to barn\ns\n.\n The sheeting maintains quality as well as reducing environmental risks. \nThis enables more flexible coverage but one local authority raised the issue of health and safety concerns when plastic sheets were being pu\nt on and off. This concern led them to build a barn instead.\nOther responses include quarries now being used for strategic stock piles, sharing of Highways Agency depots and use of the South East Wales storage facility. \n Some have split their stocks and store it at non-operational sites. \nOne has 4 new stockpiles at non-operationa\nl sites and these piles are \nshipped to operational depots as needed or for summer restock to ensure the rotation of the stock as it may be held f\nor 3 or 4 years before use.\nSome have found further space within existing depots whilst others have purchased equipment to enable them to pile salt higher so fitting more salt into barns.\nThe general approach \nwhich has been adopted over the past 4 years by\n many local authorities \nis that all salt should be covered and a number of methods are being utilised to accomplish this. \nS\nome \nlocal authorities use a mixture of sheeting, existing and new barns and sharing other organisations storage facilities. \nHowever \nsome still leave 100% of their salt uncovered with no plans to change this arrangement.  \n2\n5 local authorities have not changed their storage arrangements and these will no doubt have a range of storage options in place\n including leaving salt uncovered and\n open to the elements\n.\nQ5. Has the length of the routes you salt changed? If so, how and why?&#xa0;14 local authorities responded that they had changed their routes with all but two showing an increase.\n The remaining 49 have not altered the length of the route\ns or amount of the network they salt to any significant degree. There are of course some minor additions in the form of newly adopted roads, new developments and infrastructure, changes to bus routes and road layouts and routes near schools, social service\ns buildings and health facilities.\nA number of \nlocal authorities\n commented on the emphasis placed on school bus routes. One rural authority noted that their policy includes a section related to the number of passengers carried on school buses. As a result\n,\n there have been slight variations to the pre-treatment routes which were dependent on the annual review of school roles each September. \n There have been changes in terms of reprioritised routes to meet revised policies with the introduction of primary an\nd secondary routes enabling varied frequency of salting\n for some\n.\nTackling efficiency remains a major issues and route optimisation has been carried out by many local authorities to reduce or eliminate dead mileage. Others have optimised routes to bring ro\nutes close to new storage facilities to enable reloading if required during heavy spreads.\nEngagement with users is noted by two local authorities one of whom has added two short streets to the network at the request of councillors as they have been identi\nfied as being problematic during winter conditions whilst another noted an additional 50kms added since 2010 as result of councillor consultation o\nver\n routes and demands to increase lengths of bus routes routinely gritted.\nOne London borough commented that\n due to the extended periods of poor weather over recent years in times of severe weather minor roads are also treated.\n&#xa0;Q6. Have you had access to extra funding over this period?40 responses\n, or 63%,\n said that they had no access to extra funds over the 4\n y\near period equivalent\n. 18 said they did have extra funding and 2 noted that they had less funding whilst 3 replied that the question was not applicable due to PFI arrangements.\nA clear majority used no extra funds over this period which points to efficie\nnt services and good budget planning over a period of much higher demand for the service. \nSome responses noted an increase in budgets over the period to cover the planned cost of new equipment and additional salt.\nOf those that did have access to extra fu\nnds, sources include council reserves (the most common source), capital bids and extra fun\nding available to purchase salt made available by Welsh Government. One council noted separate funding made available through the NHS to help in the prevention of sli\nps, trips and falls.\nTwo\n local authorit\nies\n noted that they have made a bid for extra funds under the Bellwin scheme and are awaiting the outcome.\nA number of local authorities provided funding from council reserves to cover the extra costs of dealing with \nsevere weather.\n Few however have seen increases in revenue budgets due to the unpredictability of the weather. The revenue budget setting process is clearly difficult when future demand is unknown and the use of reserves is an obvious solution. In one resp\nonse, the council \nhas recognised that weather related activities , mainly winter snow and ice but also wind damage and flooding, are unplanned reactive activities ( in the broad sense). As a result, any additional expenditure over and above the allocated w\ninter budget is covered by the \nc\nouncil\n’\ns central reserves as a \nc\norporate \nr\nisk rather than a departmental cost pressure. This is an approach many \ntake although some are not as formal in their arrangements. There is no doubt that winter maintenance is seen a\ns an essential service and \nit appears \ncouncils will always provide funds to make sure that the service can be delivered effectively.     \nThe impression from responses is that most would have any overspend due to severe weather covered by reserves or a corporate fund rather than from elsewhere in the highways budget – again a recognition of the unpredictability of the weather. \nOne response \nnoted that their \noverspend ha\nd\n been funded from savings elsewhere within the council.\nSome \nlocal authorities\n have a separation of budget responsibility with for example, the housing departments funding treatment of estate roads.\nA small number of councils \nare looking to increase the base budget for the coming season but this is yet to be confirmed.\n&#xa0;Q7. What other changes have you made to your service? (e.g.  pavement salting, investing in new vehicles, community engagement)Corporate issues\nWinter service \nis more and more seen as a corporate issue alongside other emergency and high risk events such as flooding and serious traffic events. Responses noted that there is continual improvement to winter service operations across all parts of the local authority \nnot just the highways department.\nThe development of local plans for snow clearing of minor roads and non-priority footways, parishes and rural areas is a more common feature. These plans involve consultation with elected members, community councils and ot\nher bodies such as sheltered housing and care homes\n and other local \nauthorities and public services and business where necessary. One local authority has \ndeveloped a community resilience initiative, the principles of which are communities and individuals h\narnessing and developing local response and expertise to help themselves during an emergency, in a way that compliments the response of the local authority and other emergency responders.\nService level agreement\ns\n were introduced in one local authority in 2\n010 with all council services and community groups to ensure a council wide approach to winter and not just focused on roads.\nOther departments are \nbecoming more \ninvolved in winter maintenance with 2 examples being one highways department that purchased pl\noughs and spreaders for the fleet of tractors in the leisure services department. They were and will be very useful in getting into side streets more quickly. In another local authority, pavement salting is carried out by the environmental services departm\nent at the request of the highways department with additional plant being allocated to them for the purpose.\nFleet\nThe purchase of new vehicles is a common theme amongst responses to the survey with a number replacing their entire fleet over the past 3 or \n4 years \nand\n one having all of its 26 vehicles less than 1 year old. Both leasing and outright purchasing are used with some local authorities employing a mix of both. Needless to say running these vehicles is an expensive exercise and dual use vehicle \na\nre \nbecoming a far more common o\nccurrence\n. \nIn one \nlocal authority a new contract in 2011 \ninclude\nd\n provision of vehicles for the winter service whereas they were previously owned and maintained by the authority.\nFootways\nThere were quite a number of responses \nhighlighting the extra work which has been undertaken on footways and pedestrian areas over the past 4 years. This has meant investment in quad\n \nbikes, MPVs such as \nMultihog\n or Kubota\n, tow\ned\n gritters, brine tanks\n, snow blowers\n and other equipment to ensure \nheavily used footways are cleared. Others use mini tractors with front brushes rather than ploughs \nfor footway and cycleway clearance and treatment which has massively reduced the labour requirement and the treatment times. A much greater emphasis on footw\nays by one London borough is a response to an increased public expectation of what should be achieved when it snows or is icy. One council introduced the treatment of off-road cycleway routes in 2012/13. Other councils have hired additional vehicles to cle\nar snow from car parks and hard to reach areas.\nEngagement\nEngagement with\n the \ncommunity has improved over the period of the survey with responses including a number of new snow warden or ice buster schemes, both in urban and rural areas\n, far greater use o\nf social media such as twitter and facebook to communicate about real time issues, \nroad conditions and general warnings as well as information on websites such as treatment times, information around self\n-\nhelp and information for driver preparedness. One lo\ncal authority is putting gritting vehicle tracking as a pilot \non the \nweb site.\nTraining has been provided to \nparish and town councils, partners\n,\n businesses a\nnd\n farmers\n in many councils as well \nas issuing self\n-\nhelp kits to community groups.\nSalt is supplied\n to \nsome \nparish councils for them to salt public areas within the parishes and free to neighbourhood watches for use by residents in \na\n London borough. Another local authority  advertise a few weekends when \nthe\n depot is open for neighbourhood watch groups o\nr resident associations to collect bags of salt so they can salt footways.\nRural area support is also a more significant issue \nthan was previously the case \nin a number of areas.\nFunding\nWorking with NHS funding\n,\n one local authority has been able to utilise\n the probation service to assist in gritting areas around supported housing.\nAnother response noted that t\nown and \nc\nommunity \nc\nouncils are encouraged to contribute towards \nthe \ncost of new salt bins and to carry out the associated spreading of salt.\nAnother \nencourages their local parish councils to deliver self\n-\nhelp during extreme conditions through a locally developed emergency plan and a parish grant scheme through which funding is provided to pay for additional equipment and resources such as additional sa\nlt bins, footpath clearance equipment and the hire of equipment.   \nSalt bins\nWith regard to salt bins, a number of councils are reducing the number in their areas because they cannot guarantee that the salt is used on the highways and footway as expected \nand if it is, it does not last long. Alternatively others are adding extra salt bins following requests from the public. \nOne response noted the proposed deployment of 1 tonne salt bags to augment the salt bins that are already located on-street across t du\nring severe weather events.\nOne local authority will gather additional information about the usage of grit bins \nin future \nto better align needs with the locations \nthat \nthey \ncurrently use.\nStaffing\nThe introduced of night shift operation in parts of \nthe \ncou\nnty are another initiative by one local\n \nauthority. Carriageway nightshift gritting and snow clearing routes have been implemented during the main standby period by \nanother.\nOthers provide winter seminars for all staff allied to regular gritter driver train\ning. \nAnother has trained 3 new winter decision makers who will be used as verifiers for main duty controllers.\nNew technology\nOne contractor has carried out thermal mapping and upgraded the ice alert systems as well as using GPS tracking to defend claims \nabout gritting not having taken place. Others have invested in additional weather stations to improve the accuracy of forecasts and so resulting in savings.\nAnother utilised a hire fleet of 9 cubic metre gritters\n rather than the historically utilised 6 cubic metres to establish whether time savings could be made by gritting for longer with larger capacity vehicles compared with previous years. \nOther initiatives include use of VMS on carriageways and improved elec\ntronic record management.\nSustainability\nOne response commented on a greater focus on sustainable service delivery which resulted in around a 30% reduction in salt utilisation.\nPerformance NetworksPerformance Network is the largest public sector perfor\nmance management and benchmarking service in Europe incorporating data from local authorities across the UK. \n APSE produces direction of travel reports which incorporate average data from all local authorities who submit. The following data covers winter m\naintenance activities.\nPI 111 Actual days per annum where non-planned winter maintenance was carried out. (This \nPI\n \ntracks\n the actual number of days per annum where non-planned winter maintenance was carried out.  \nIt\n refers to unpredictable events and includes snow and ice clearance\n).\nThe graph looks at the number of days of unplanned activity and highlights the \nchanges in the scale of the service and the nature of the unpredictability of the weather\n. It clearly refle\ncts the fact that there was less unplanned activity in 2011-12 when conditions were as bad as in previous years. This would appear to show that prediction arrangements improved over the timescale.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;PI 117 –Actual response time for non-planned salting. It shows\n the average actual response time \n(\nhours\n)\n for completion of non\n-\nplanned pre-salting\n \ncover\ning\n the total operation up to completion of salting.\nThe following PI shows that response times stayed relatively stable with a range of less than 15 \nminutes over 5 years with an average response time of around 3.5 hours\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPI 107 – Annual cost of salting per km of network salted. \nThis \nmea\nsures the annual cost \nand\n is calculated by using the total annual service provider / client cost for the winter maintenance function figure which includes profit, winter maintenance costs, overheads, charges for the vehicles and central establishment charges.  This figure does not\n include asset rentals, debt charges and other capital charges or management and overhead costs of the service purchaser\n \n/commissioning organisation (e.g. client unit).  The figure is then divided by the total km of the highway network which is covered by \nthe salting regime.\nThe annual cost of salting per km increased significantly between 2007-08 and 2009-10 but subsequently dropped again. The increase coincided with a heavier demand on the service so is understandable as it included increased costs for it\nems such as extra salt and the driver costs of extra runs.  The costs then flattened out and decreased reflecting good practice in terms of efficiencies and reduced costs even though the weather was remained severe. \n&#xa0;\nPI 112 Km length of footways where precautionary gritting was undertakenA number of responses to the survey commented on the extra attention paid to salting footways and this is borne out by Performance Networks data. There was a dramatic increase in 2011-12 and no doubt this will be increa\nsed further in 2012-13. This will be as a result both of expanded routes and new equipment increasing productivity. \n2008-0919 km2009-1015 km2010-1114 km2011-1261 km&#xa0;ConclusionsThis survey covered a 4 year period and as such includes a wide range of developments within local authorities. It highlights the breadth of changes which have been made to services including significant investments, the use of new materials, engagement wi\nth the public and discussions with councillors amongst others.  Of course some local authorities will have undertaken changes some years ago whilst others are just catching up. \nWhat does emerge is a sector which perennially reviews elements of the service\n such as routes and salt stock levels and has enabled service improvement with a number of innovations and initiatives. Severe weather has forced the service to remain aware of developments by suppliers also and only 1 or 2 of the 63 responses provided det\nails of no changes whatsoever to the way their services are arranged. \nThe development of winter plans as part of emergency planning arrangements reflect the corporate approach to the issue which inc\nludes\n cross departmental action, allied to work with othe\nr public sector providers and other local organisations. Winter maintenance is no longer a reactive response by the highways department to a one off snow incident.\nThe call for collaboration in public services is being acted upon by some of the local autho\nrities who took part in this survey. Joint arrangements to procure salt, storage of salt stocks in other organisations depots and finance provided by other public organisations are examples. \nFinancial questions will continue to arise with regard to this s\nervice area. Snow and ice create problems in \nterms of highway and footway surfaces\n which lead to deterioration in the surface, cracks and\n potholes. Therefore it is imperative that snow, ice and water are removed from the highway as quickly as possible whic\nh reflects the importance of the service. Nonetheless all of the snow and ice which accumulates can never be removed which means the condition of the highway and footway (and drainage systems) needs to be in top condition so that water can’t begin the proc\ness of deterioration. This is of course a circular argument – the roads and footways need to be well maintained to avoid the worst outcomes of snow and ice. \nThis is the perennial discussion highways engineers put forward at budget time highlighting the im\nportance of asset management, planned maintenance and the economic value of the network. \nAs noted above, it will be interesting to see how winter maintenance budgets fare over the next few years if the weather is far less severe than over the last 4 years\n.\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
