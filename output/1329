[normal]I am 
[normal]RoSPA’s
[normal] (Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents) Occupational Safety Adviser and Secretary to our National Occupational Safety and Health Committee. I understand that you are chairing a Lords Committee looking at parts of the Government’s De-regulation Bill which, inter alia, proposes significant changes on how the self-employed are covered in health and safety law. While 
[normal]RoSPA
[normal] has supported several aspects of the Government’s health and safety reform programme, we have some serious concerns about this particular move.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Other organisations, such as IOSH and the TUC, have also raised concerns about the proposals. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]RoSPA
[normal] was pleased that the 
[normal]Löfstedt
[normal] review of health and safety legislation confirmed that our health and safety law is broadly fit-for-purpose but we feel that some of the detailed changes that the Government now plan in the wake of the Professor’s recommendations may actually end up making things more complicated than they need to be.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Based on his experience in Sweden one of 
[normal]Ragnar
[normal] 
[normal]Löfstedt’s
[normal] ideas was to exempt self-employed business people from health and safety law but only if they really were working alone in low hazard sectors. He accepted that exemption would not apply to those whose actions could affect the health and safety of others, including members of the public. Also, he accepted that many self-employed people such as consultants and designers would still have statutory duties to ensure that their decisions and/or advice did not adversely affect others’ safety and health.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In defending his proposal, Professor 
[normal]Löfstedt
[normal] has said that the aim here would be to remove roughly one million very low risk workers from the scope of health and safety law and thereby help reduce the perception that this law is “inappropriately applied”.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]During the recent consultation on implementing this change, we sounded several notes of caution. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]While at first glance such a move might seem sensible and, for example, could work well for people such as IT workers based at home, an exemption as proposed could also make knowing precisely what to do difficult for many others. For example, a self-employed person working on their own but in a higher risk, non-exempt setting would not have to make use of safety equipment whereas the lone worker, who was actually an employee, would have to. A self-employed worker choosing not to adopt necessary precautions might then have an unfair economic advantage over competitors doing exactly the same work but in association with others. And although the exemption will not apply to self-employed construction workers, the construction union UCATT has aired worries that the Government could extend changes to that industry in the future. (During 2011/12, 22 of the 49 worker fatalities in the construction industry involved the self-employed, compared to 18 self-employed deaths out of a total of 50 in 2010/11).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]RoSPA
[normal] feels strongly that, in a proven regulatory regime where the level of duty to work safely is proportionate to the level of risk, the millions of self-employed lone workers who work at home, for example, are, de facto, already exempt. If there is little or no risk, in 
[normal]practice the law requires them to do very little, if anything. They will never be routinely inspected. And they are not going to sue themselves if they have an accident!
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What 
[normal]is
[normal] worrying however is that, if this change is not handled properly, it could be misunderstood and end up giving the green light to “cowboy elements” in higher risk settings. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]And then there is the whole problem of the self-employed who in practice actually work for clients as employees. At best, this change may still leave the conscientious self-employed business person, who works at the margins of significant risk, having to make some sort of assessment about whether they are inside or outside the terms of the exemption. At worst, it could lead to all self-employed people wrongly assuming that health and safety law no longer applies to them in any circumstance.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The challenge of allaying misperceptions about what the law actually requires of the ‘low risk’ self employed could be much better dealt with in our view if the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) crafted and publicised good, simple guidance for the self-employed, reminding them to deal with risks in a sensible and proportionate way.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is a view in some quarters that individual entrepreneurs should be free to accept the risk level they choose to create for themselves, particularly if their lack of attention to health and safety results only in injury to themselves and to no one else. On the other hand it can be argued that even sole traders still have obligations to make sure that they do not injure themselves through their recklessness and thereby impose avoidable costs on the NHS and other publicly funded services. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What 
[normal]Löfstedt
[normal] conceded was that many of the concerns of the self-employed about health and safety stem actually from the fear of being sued after an injury or health damage to others due to their negligence. So it is important that all self- employed workers realise that any exemption from criminal law will not eliminate their common law duties of care.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In line with the founding principles of the 1972 
[normal]Robens
[normal] Committee (from which the 1974 HSW Act sprang), risk and not the size of an organisation should, in our view, remain the deciding factor in influencing the extent of action required by law. 
[normal]The arguments set out there
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]in some detail still seem to make sense. 
[normal](
[normal]See Chapter 6 pages 54 and 55
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]and Summary paragraph 474 of
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]the 
[normal]Robens
[normal] Report.) 
[normal]Logically this fundamental principle should not simply vanish when the work is being carried out by one self-employed person.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If the self-employed are going to be asked to think about health and safety at all, we feel that it is much more logical to ask them to think if there are any significant risks in their work and what they might need to do about them - rather than trying to get them to follow a complex decision-making algorithm to work out if they are outside or inside the terms of exemption.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]More generally, in our view, there is a real lack of evidence that these proposals are a priority in terms of improving health and safety outcomes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Ultimately, we remain of the view that education rather than deregulation is the real answer here.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I trust you will find these views useful,
[normal]&#xa0;
