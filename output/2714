[normal]Southampton City Council – Written evidence[bold]&#xa0;[bold]CALL FOR EVIDENCE:  JOINT COMMITTEE ON THE DRAFT DE-REGULATION BILL[bold]&#xa0;[bold]I am the Director of Corporate Services at Southampton City Council and following discussion with officers at the Council, we would like to make the following points specifically in relation to Question 15 and some matters that the joint committee may wish to take into account we believe would further support the policy intention laid out within the Deregulation Bill:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.
[normal]              
[normal]The issue of statutory advertisements having to go into a local newspaper as compared to using local authority internet sites has long been an issue.  It may well be appropriate to consider revisiting that issue.  There are clearly balances between the interests of local government and the costs of placing statutory advertisements in newspapers etc as compared to using the internet, the ability of the public to access the internet (although evidence suggests that access is increasing significantly) and the impact on business.  However, it has been a long running issue and is a matter that could be considered.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]              
[normal]In relation to local government decision-making set out within the Local Government Act 1972, there is an obligation to provide paper copies of committee reports, agendas, etc as compared to being able to rely 100% on electronic versions (save for needing to supply paper copies to those with specific needs, requirements, etc).  Many authorities are now using significant amounts of IT to manage this process and would wish to rely entirely (but with appropriate exceptions) on 100% electronic versions of papers for all their decision-making.  Relief from having to produce paper copies, save in proportionate and appropriate limited circumstances would produce a significant cost saving.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]              
[normal]The requirements within the Local Government Act 2000 in relation to the Policy Framework, specifically the delineated statutory plans required to be within the Policy Framework, would be suitable for reconsideration, bearing in mind the proposed repeal of duties relating to consultation, a change within the legislation to reduce the mandatory nature of the Policy Framework would enable councils to determine the contents of the Policy Framework, and release the decision-making (and, therefore, bureaucratic burden).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.
[normal]              
[normal]Where local authorities, such as Southampton, have contracted out activities relating to income-related benefits, the Contracting Out (Functions and Local Authorities: Income Related Benefits) Order 2002, combined with Guidance Circular HP/CTB A22/2002 and Section 4 of the 2002 Statutory Instrument require the council to undertake a random sample of decisions on claims of not less than 10%.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is suggested that this requirement is relaxed: fewer could be checked, that the amount could either be specified as a lower minimum and/or the Chief Financial Officer (who ultimately has responsibility for the financial administration of the council’s business, including, therefore, the discharge of this function) could determine the appropriate rate depending upon the circumstances and their satisfaction with the robustness of the contracted out activity.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I have kept all these points extremely brief, but I am more than happy to amplify them and given detail around specific legislative issues if that is helpful, and I am also more than happy to answer any questions on behalf of the Council if you would like to refer the issues back to me.
