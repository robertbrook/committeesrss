"&#xa0;\nAFS0002&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by Laura Evans Vogel&#xa0;\nI am a parent, a teacher and a former long-time resident of Westminster; I also run a community blog.  Though I am no longer a resident of Westminster, I am still active in my community in Pimlico and am obliged to raise questions regarding the changes in education in Pimlico and south Westminster.  This is no small undertaking, I stand to gain nothing other than the clean conscience that I did not simply ignore a potential problem.  \n&#xa0;\nFuture Academies &#xa0;\nPimlico Primary&#xa0;\nChurchill Gardens School:Curriculum:Speech and Language Unit:Playground:November 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n"
