"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.1\n              \nKent County Council\n (KCC)\n, as the Local Transport Authority for \nKent\n,\n welcomes the opportunity to s\nubmit written \nevidence to this i\nnquiry\n on the Strategic Road Network\n.\n \nWe would be very happy to expand on any aspect either in writing or as oral evidence. \n \n \n&#xa0;\n1.2\n              \nIn making this response KCC wishes to express its full endorsement of the response made to this Committee by \nthe South East Local Transport Board (SELTB\n).\n \nMedway Council \nand East Sussex County Council \nalso fully support\n this submission.  \n&#xa0;\n1.3  \n              \nKCC’s subm\nission \nof evidence can be summarised as follows:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.4\n              \nKent County Council\n recommends to the committee that action is taken by the Government\n to\n:\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1\n              \nThe Public\n Inquiry fo\nr the A21 Tonbridge to Pembury d\nualling scheme was held between 14 May and 9 July 2013, the outcome of which is expected in late 2013 or early 2014. The Public Inquiry was due to be held three years earlier in July 2010, but was cancelled due to\n the 2010 Spending Review. If the Secretary of State rules in favour of the scheme it could be delivered in the next Spending Review Period, however, delivery is by no means certain, which is extremely disappointing given that this scheme is key to address\ning the transport challenges in \nWest Kent\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nCutting congestion and improving journey time reliability along the A21 corridor is a key element of KCC’s transport delivery plan \nGrowth w\nithout Gridlock\n. T\nhe current Local Transpo\nrt Plan (2011-2016)\n refers\n to the economic harm that KCC believes has been caused by delay to the dualling of the A21 between Tonbridge and Pembury. \nThe County Council recognises that this is a priority project for \nKent\n, yet it has been delayed due to the weaknesses in how Governme\nnt plans, funds and delivers improvements to the Strategic Road Network.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n              \nKCC has evidence that delivery by the Local Transport Authority, i.e. \nKent County Council\n, would \nhave \nresult\ned\n in completion of the scheme at a lower cost. KCC is therefore advoc\nating that \nthe reforms to the Highways Agency\n (HA)\n include provision for \nfuture \nscheme delivery by Local Transport Authorities\n,\n where it can be demonstrated that this would provide improved efficiency and value for money.\n  \n \n&#xa0;\n2.4\n              \nKCC\n conducted a \ncost \nreview of the A21 Tonbridge to Pembury dualling scheme which has led us to believe that it could have \nbeen \ndelivered\n for \naround 20% \nless tha\nn the HA\n. This example \ntherefore \ndemonstrates how future \nschemes cou\nld be delivered for\n lower cost by Local Transpor\nt Authorities\n.\n In\n \nKCC\n’s\n \nreview\n \nof \nthe\n HA\n’s\n proposal\n for the A21 scheme\n (Option A)\n, we\n explored three alternative options; Options\n B, C and D with each having it\ns own programme. \nT\nhe \ncost \ndifferences between KCC’s\n Options\n B and C\n and the HA’s scheme \nare primarily fees associated with the different statutory approval routes and inflation associated with the relative timescales. Our third option, D, \nwould involve\n major chan\nges\n to the scheme and \nit \nwould need to be progressed\n through the\n National\nly\n Signi\nficant\n Infrastructure Projects (NSIP) process through the Planning Inspectorate.\n \nT\nhe alternative options are \nsummarised \nas follows:\n&#xa0;\n•\n              \nOption B \nwould \nhave \ninvolve\nd\n m\ninor changes to \nthe \nHA scheme\n \nand\n \nassumed\n that\n KCC \ncould \nhave \ndeliver\ned\n the scheme as agent to the HA under a Section 6 Agreement.\n&#xa0;\n•\n              \nOption C \nalso \ninvolved\n \nm\ninor changes to \nthe \nHA scheme\n \nwith additionally\n \nde-trunking the road to enable KCC to become the Highw\nay Authority and then deliver\n the scheme to benefit from exemption from VAT.\n KCC \ndoes not pay VAT on its own highway schemes, but to achieve this, the A21 would need to be de-trunked. \nDe-trun\nking could also be of benefit considering that many other ‘A’ roads that fulfil a similar func\ntion are successfully managed by the Local Transport Authority\n.\n&#xa0;\n•\n              \nOption D\n \nwould \nhave \ninvolve\nd\n a c\nompletely fresh start, comprising \nfundamental design changes\n \nand \nthe \nde-trunking of the A21\n, with the transfer of\n management \nresponsibility to \nthe Local \nTransport Authority.\n \nThe \nscheme would \nalso \nhave \nneed\ned\n to be progressed\n through the \nNSIP process\n.\n \nThis option\n demonstrate\ns that\n significant cost sav\nings could have\n be\nen\n made. Our review showed\n that a number of design elements and concessions ma\nde by the HA\n are over generous.\n \nOur provisional analysis shows that s\nubstantial savings \ncould \nhave \nbe\nen\n made on a \nnumber of fronts, including\n:\n tightening the design to keep\n more to the existing alignment;\n usi\nng more of the existing highway; woodland replacement; earth\nworks;\n \nfootwa\ny and side-road provision. \nThese \nsavings \nwould \nhave \nneed\ned\n to be fully developed at detailed design stage but suggest \nthat \npotential savings\n could have been made\n on \nthe HA’s scheme\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.5\n              \nIn summary, KCC has identified overall cost savings on \nthe HA scheme through a review of:\n&#xa0;\nKCC can p\nrovide more in depth evidence to support the above if required.\n              \n2.6\n              \nThe example o\nf the A21 Tonbridge to Pembury dualling s\ncheme demonstrates t\nhe way in which t\nhe \nwork of the \nHA \nhas \nled\n to increased cost estimates\n. This\n \nresult\ns\n in poor financial managemen\nt\n and a high risk of non-delivery. Without KCC challenging the HA on their costs, we believe that the A21 Tonbridge to Pembury dualling scheme would not still be a live scheme today\n. A new way forward is needed for all future high capital cost projects\n. Th\nere is now the opportunity with the Government’s proposed reforms of the HA and the management of the Strategic Road Network to allow Local Transport Autho\nrities to deliver\n major road schemes\n.\n KCC believes this will result in greater efficiencies, value fo\nr money and delivery of more schemes that are vital for economic growth.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n              \nThe Department for Transport (DfT) Circular 02/2013 ‘The Strategic Road Network and the Delivery of Sustainable Development’ section 40 states that \n“where the strategic growth test cannot be met there will be no additional junctions with, or direct means o\nf access to, motorways and other routes of motorway standard other than for the provision of signed roadside facilities for road users, maintenance compounds and, exceptionally, major transport interchanges.”\n \n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nThis policy prevents the construction of \na new Junction 5a on the M2 which would provide the \nKent\n \nScience\n \nPark\n with direct motorway access and open up the area for further employment. Although Section 39 of Circular 02/2013 states that \n“where appropriate, proposals for the creation of new junctio\nns or direct means of access may be identified and developed at the Plan-making stage in circumstances where it can be established that such new infrastructure is essential for the delivery of strategic planned growth”\n; the Local Planning Authority has not\n been able to include the Kent Science Park as a strategic site due to the uncertainty of being able to deliver the new motorway junction and a full link road to the A2, which current policy interpretation would require. \n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nThe risk to the Local Plannin\ng Authority of including this as a strategic site to enable a new motorway junction would be that their Local Plan is found unsound on the basis that the considerable cost of the motorway junction and link road is unlikely to come forward in the plan perio\nd. A relaxation of this policy however, would enable construction of a partial junction and a slip road.  \n&#xa0;\n3.4\n              \nKCC therefore advocates that policies concerning new junctions on the Strategic Road Network are relaxed to allow the delivery of schemes that w\nould stimulate development, e\nconomic growth and job creation;\n thus \nallow\ning\n the Strategic Road Network to\n play its full part in\n support\ning\n regeneration and economic prosperity.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4\n.1\n              \nThe example of the proposed new Lower Thames Crossing, the corridor options of which were recently consulted on by the DfT, demonstrates how investment in strategic roads could be increased through attracting new invest\nors. \nKCC has held extensive discussions with North American private sector\n \ninvestors who regularly finance large scale tolled roads projects and are keen\n \nto be involved in the delivery a new \nLower Thames\n crossing. They firmly hold\n the view that this \nscheme\n could be delivered at no cost to the public purse and\n \nare hungry for such opportunities.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n              \nInitial discussions with North American private sector investors indicated that they would want\n a realist\nic assessment of what is achievable in terms of finances\n; and the\n structure \nof \na \nscheme delivery deal needs to\n ma\nrketable to the private sector. A 25 year concession is\n too short and would almost certainly require re-financing, as would a 30 year concession. A 50 year concession was preferred. \n&#xa0;\n4.3\n              \nIt is vital that \nthe \nnew and existing crossings are linked as the\n existing toll inco\nme would\n be required to finance the debt\n incurred from construction of the new crossing\n. \nThe p\nrivate sector would want flexibility to increase tolls, possibly by inflation \nto achieve a minimum coverage ratio of debt. Their preference would be for toll increases to be determined independ\nent of Government in order to remove political interference.\n Surety of costs is vital for private financiers\n, as \nwithout that, the risks make\n a pr\noposal very difficult. However, a new \nLower Thames\n \ncrossing \nguarantees investors\n a rate of \nreturn from day one of opening\n.\n \nTo give greater guarantee of cash flow in the first 5 years, it was advised that inflation\n +2% would be preferred due to the usu\nal tight\n margins \nand to allow for mitigation of risk. \n&#xa0;\n4.4\n              \nKCC spoke to one particular infrastructure investor, a world leader\n in developing infrastructure\n investment\n as an asset cl\nass for institutional investors, who have\n a proven track record in identif\nying, investing and managing infrastructure in\nvestments around the world\n.\n They see a new Lower Thames C\nrossing as similar to the \nGolden\n \nEars\n \nBridge\n \nacross the \nFraser\n \nRiver\n in \nVancouver\n, \nCanada\n,\n which opened in 2009 at a cost of $808 million (£509 m). It is\n an all-electronic tolled highway with 2011 toll revenue amounting to $38 million (£23.94 m). It is financed by a 35 year concession.\n&#xa0;\n4.5\n              \nThis investor indicated\n that \nthey would expect the price of equity to be between 8-9\n% without construction risk; 11-1\n7% with construction risk; 11-14% with toll risk (where the private sector takes the traffic volume risk and not the Government). \nIn order \nto make the debt financing work, an ‘availability payment’ would reduce the toll risk and therefore the cost of equit\ny. The Government would keep all toll income and guarantee the private funders a minimum revenue return.\n \nThey stressed that as the principle of tolling the Thames at this location\n (outer \nLondon\n) had been established, a\n dual crossing network would be very a\nttractive to investors and this would reduce the cost of the equity. A crossing located away from the existing location\n (Dartford-Thurrock)\n would be preferred by investors to maximise future growth opportunity and ensure network resilience (and hence reven\nue streams).\n The c\noncession would need tolling flexibility and 50 year duration, with potential for re-financing. \n&#xa0;\n4.6\n              \nThey\n also \nsuggested \nbuilding in performance measures based around journey time reliability, user satisfaction, safety, etc\n,\n into concession arrangements.\n T\nhey\n indicated that\n there would be no dramatic difference between a tunnel and a bridge in terms of debt finance. Whilst the risks associated with tunnelling are higher than for a bridge they are not significant. The geotechn\nical data is essential to mitigating these. Once all\n risks are known an advisor would\n help structure the deal.\n \nLong term revenue \nincome is essential to fu\nnding infrastructure investment; although immediate yield is also important, i.e. revenue from existin\ng tolling.\n&#xa0;\n4.7\n              \nThe KCC experience with the North American investment sector clearly demonstrates how investment in strategic roads could be achieved through attracting overseas private sector investors for toll road schemes such as a new river crossing, a\nnd thus deliver vital national road infrastructure without the need for public funding. KCC strongly advocates that the Government takes a proactive roll in entering into negotiations with private sector investors to fund large scale projects essential to \nthe future growth of the \nUK\n economy.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5\n.1\n              \nKCC has made the case that t\nhe over estimation of costs by the Highways Agency for delivery of major road projects, as demonstrated by the A21 Tonbridge to Pembury dualling scheme, affects affordability, value for money, and risks scheme delivery. \nKCC advocates that \nfuture \ns\nchemes \non\n the Strategic Road \nNetwork \ncould be delivered more efficiently and cost effectively by Local Transport Authorities. \n&#xa0;\n5.2\n              \nKCC has illustrated how p\nolicies \nthat govern\n the Strategic Road Network are preventing the delivery of schemes that would otherwise s\ntimulate development, economic growth and job creation, as demonstrated by the inability to deliver a new \nJunction 5a on the M20 to access\n \nthe \nKent\n \nScience\n \nPark\n. \nKCC advocates that t\nhere needs to be greater flexibility to allow the Strategic Road Network t\no support regeneration and economic prosperity.\n&#xa0;\n5.3\n              \nKCC has provided e\nxamples of North Ameri\ncan investors,\n interest\ned\n in constructing and operating a new Low\ner Thames Crossing, to\n \nshow \nhow private sector investment in the \nUK\n’s strategic roads could \ndeliver schemes that improve the Strategic Road Network\n and deliver economic growth\n.\n&#xa0;\n5\n.4\n              \nKent County Council\n therefore recommends to the committee that action is taken by the Government \nto allow local \ndelivery of major road schemes; \nprovide greater flexib\nility in current policy govern\ning Highways Agency procedures; and\n take a more proactive approach to attract private sector funding \nto deliver schemes that improve\n the Strategic Road Network.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOcto\nber 2011\n&#xa0;\n"
