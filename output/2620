defaultWritten evidence submitted by the Sex Education Forum [OLS0070]default&#xa0;
defaultSummarydefault1. Technical solutions such as lessons about online s
defaultafety in computing classes and internet controls are by themselves insufficient to protect children and young people. A broad and comprehensive programme of sex and relationships education (SRE) in school is essential to ensure that children and young peop
defaultle get accurate information about sex and sexual health and an understanding of what constitutes respectful relationships.  This has been recognised in numerous reports including by 
defaultOfsted
default and the Office of the Children’s Commissioner. 
default2. A broad programm
defaulte of good quality SRE should also address the issue of on-line safety and pornography. This can complement the more technical learning about safety gained through computing classes. 
default3. Currently the provision of SRE in schools is unacceptably patchy and i
defaultnconsistent.
default 
defaultEvery child and young person has a right to comprehensive SRE and we (as adults) have a duty to ensure this.  
default&#xa0;default4. 
defaultThe best way to ensure this is by making SRE (within Personal, Social, Health and Economic (PSHE) education) 
defaultcompulsory
default for prim
defaultary and secondary schools, and for teachers to receive training on the subject. 
defaultThe Government guidance on SRE should also be updated to provide clarity to schools.  
default  
default&#xa0;
default5. The majority of parents want SRE to be compulsory in schools and many would also li
defaultke support to fulfil their role at home as educators about growing up, safety, sex and relationships.
default6. Our evidence submission to this inquiry covers: 
default&#xa0;defaultWhat is SRE and how can it address online safety?default&#xa0;
default7. SRE involves learning about the emotional, social and physical aspects of growing up, relationships, human sexuality, sex and sexual health. It should equip children and young people with the information, skills and positive values to enable them to hav
defaulte safe, fulfilling relationships and to take responsibility for their sexual health and wellbeing. 
default&#xa0;default8. 
defaultChildren and young people sometimes find pornography 
defaultbecause they are looking for information about sex and relationships online
default. 
defaultFurther research is 
defaultneeded to establish if there is a link between good quality SRE and access/avoidance of pornography. Gaps in research about the link between accessing pornography and behaviour are identified by Horvath (2013) in the Office of the 
defaultChidlren’s
default Commissioner

defaultrovision of good quality SRE means that young people 
defaulthave a reliable source of information about sex and 
defaultrelationships.

defaultGood quality 
defaultSRE 
defaultcontributes to understanding
default how pornography distorts reality

defaults
default men and women and gender roles, and how pictures and videos are routinely edited. 
default9. The Sex Education Forum e-magazine shows how pornography and issues related to it can be effectively addressed in SRE and includes suggestions
default from pupils about the key messages that should be taught to their peers. 
default10.
default defaultThis is what a group of Year 11 pupils thought other young people should know about pornography:
default default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAbout safetydefault: Not all things shown in pornography are safe in your own sex li
defaultfe: keep safe, use condoms and go to a clinic regularly. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAbout privacydefault: No video cameras in the room! In case you film yourself but then have a bad breakup, keep your sex life private. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAbout realitydefault: Don't believe everything you see. Pornography is act
defaulting and not 'real'. The sex and bodies are mostly unrealistic - and there is a lot of editing. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAbout the actorsdefault: Some people may be forced into making it. Some actors use performance enhancing drugs to 'perform' or to be able to get through stuff that is
default painful. It can affect the actors physically, mentally and emotionally, and can mean that relationships suffer. There are dangers risked by the actors like infections and abuse. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAbout sex lives and relationshipsdefault: You can learn some helpful positions from some films. The so-called pleasure you see may be anything but. You don't have to watch it at all. It can be addictive to the viewer and can mean that you might not be able to have a healthy, happy sex life yours
defaultelf if you are addicted.

defaultFrom ‘The Sex Educational Supplement’ Issue 1 (2013).

default&#xa0;
default11. 
defaultAt primary school classes should start with discussing diff
defaulterences between boys and girls bodies, and the importance of loving and respectful relationships. Learning correct names for genitalia is important so that children have the language to describe their bodies, understand what behaviour would be abusive and 
defaultreport it if it happens to them. At secondary level lessons can look at ‘
defaultsexting
default’ and pressures from peers and make more direct reference to pornography in the context of learning about consent, body image, gender roles and respectful relationships. 
default12. H
defaultaving a basic universal language about respect, our bodies, growing up and sex is essential to support children with the words needed to report abuse and the belief that it is ‘OK to talk about this’.  
defaultWhat is the standard of SRE in schools today?default13
default.Ofsted
default inspectors report that SRE is currently inadequate in a third of schools (2013).
default Young people have repeatedly said that the SRE they receive is inadequate – with 28% describing their school SRE as ‘bad’ or ‘very bad’ in a survey in 2011 (Sex Educ
defaultation Forum). Young people say that the relationships aspect of SRE is the most neglected
default (Sex Education Forum 2008)
default.
default default14. 
defaultOfsted
default 
defaultconsulted pupils for their recent PSHE report ‘Not yet good enough’ (2013) and consequently 
defaultrecommended that schools address p
defaultornography within SRE
default. New research with young people carried out by Brook (2013 unpublished: also being submitted to this inquiry) shows that young people want 
defaultyoung people need better, more inclusive education on internet safety, both for children and fo
defaultr parents, 
defaultnot least 
defaultto ensure that knowledge, skills and understanding around online safety are embedded in the next generati
defaulton. 
default15. 
defaultOfsted
default are also concerned that some primary schools are failing to teach the basic body science that is necessary to unde
defaultrpin further learning about bodily privacy and safety. They found: “
defaultyounger pupils had not always learnt the correct names for sexual body parts
default” and see this as a safeguarding failure because it leaves children without the language skills to understand th
defaulteir bodies, know what is acceptable / unacceptable and to say what has happened to them (2013).
default&#xa0;defaultWhat is the evidence that SRE works? default&#xa0;default16. National and international research shows that good quality SRE has a protective function as young people who have good SRE are more likely to choose to have sex for the first time later, more likely to use contraception and to have fewer sexual partne
defaultrs (Kirby 2007, UNESCO 2009 and NICE 2010). 
default17. A comprehensive 
defaultprogramme
default of SRE also results in young people being less likely to have an ‘age-discrepant’ partner (Lindberg 2012). 
defaultHaving an older partner is a significant risk factor for experiencing phys
defaultical, emotional and sexual violence (for girls) – and a risk for sexual exploitation
default (Barter, 2009). 
default18. There is also evidence that SRE is more effective if home and school are involved (Kirby 2007 and see 
defaultEmmerson
default 2011). Parents are overwhelmingly suppo
defaultrtive of SRE and a recent survey shows that 83% of parents want SRE lessons to cover issues relating to pornography (NAHT, 2013 and see also 
defaultMumsnet
default 2011).  
default19. SRE aims to contribute to behavior change, including reducing unprotected and unwanted sex, an
defaultd reducing harmful 
defaultbehaviour
default, including sexual offences such as assault and abuse. 
default&#xa0;
default20. Good SRE, together with access to sexual health services will contribute to several public health priorities that are essential for the health and well-being of the na
defaulttion, and especially to women:
