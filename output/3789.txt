&#xa0;Written evidence from Anthony Cartmell (CYS0042)I have cycled as a long-distance tourist for 30 years, and now have a family who love cycling if only they could find safe places to ride their bikes. We try to use bicycles as much as possible for local trips, but often are forced to use the car to stay safe.

[[[Whether cycling is safe, particularly in towns and cities.]]]

[[[ 1.1]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Quick answer: No, cycling is not safe in the UK.]]]

[[[ 1.1.1]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Cycling is statistically safe, in that relatively few people get killed]]]

[[[ or seriously injured riding their bikes. BUT cycling in the UK is subjectively extremely dangerous: it's an activity that apparently needs specialist clothing, protective equipment, and detailed training.]]]

[[[What central and local Government could do to improve cycling ]]]

[[[ 2.1]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Quick answer: ]]]

[[[provide well-designed ]]]

[[[cycleways]]]

[[[ in addition to footways and carriageways on our roads, just as the Dutch do.]]]

[[[ 2.1.1]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Back in the late 1800's when bicycles were deemed to be more like carriages than pedestrians, cyclists were required to ride in the carriageway. In]]]

[[[ modern times, cyclists put themselves are risk of serious injury and death by riding in the carriageway amongst cars and ]]]

[[[Which is why many flout the law, making themselves criminals, by riding on the footway.]]]

[[[ Of course the footways are not design]]]

[[[ed for cycling, and this annoys pedestrians. We need an in-between way: ]]]

[[[cycleways]]]

[[[. Such ]]]

[[[cycleways]]]

[[[ can be used by people on bicycles, people in faster mobility scooters, people on ]]]

[[[ 2.1.2]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Local Government need to plan strategically for cycling. Here in West Sussex they have abolished the post of Cycling Officer, have dropped any pretence that they have a Cycling Strategy, and have devolved highways decision-making to such a low level th]]]

[[[at it's now impossible for ]]]

[[[cycleways]]]

[[[ between adjacent towns to be even considered.]]]

[[[ 2.1.3]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Cycleways]]]

[[[ should be designed as if they were half-scale roads for motor vehicles. They should be direct, coherent, safe, and should not have obstructions in the middle of th]]]

[[[em!]]]

[[[ 2.1.4]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[To have any chance at all of gaining the benefits in safety and community that the Dutch enjoy, we need to be investing ]]]

[[[. Long-term leadership and long-term investment ar]]]

[[[e crucial if any change is to be made. If we don't invest, then the inevitable result will be more people cycling (as fuel costs rise) and more people being killed and seriously injured in collisions with motor vehicles.]]]

[[[ 3.]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Whether it would be desirable and f]]]

[[[easible to segregate cyclists from other road users, including, for example, by prohibiting HGVs from entering city centres at peak hours.]]]

[[[ 3.1]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Quick answer: Yes, both desirable and feasible. Segregate cyclists from motor vehicles both in space and time, just a]]]

[[[s the Dutch do.]]]

[[[ 3.1.1]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Cycling is a mode of transport that has the potential to solve many of our urban problems: pollution, congestion, road danger, lack of exercise, lack of community. Cycling should therefore be prioritised in planning and funding over less-ef]]]

[[[ficient modes of transport such as private motor vehicles.]]]

[[[ 3.1.2]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[HGVs have no place in busy city streets. Unless they really are essential, they should be replaced by smaller vehicles delivering locally from out-of-town distribution centres.]]]

[[[ 3.1.3]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[We need to decide wh]]]

[[[at our roads and streets are for, and design them to meet their chosen functions. Major roads should allow HGV ]]]

[[[lorries]]]

[[[, but should have completely segregated ]]]

[[[cycleways]]]

[[[. Local streets should be blocked to through motor traffic, have 20mph speed limits, and ]]]

[[[on-street cycle lanes as needed. We should stop trying to have roads that simultaneously try to be cycle routes, motorways, shopping streets and residential streets all at the same time.]]]

[[[Other ideas for improving cycling safety would also be welcomed.]]]

[[[ 4.1]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Quic]]]

[[[k answer: don't try to increase safety, work to reduce or remove the danger.]]]

[[[ 4.1.1]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Cycling is intrinsically safe. What is not safe is being forced to cycle in amongst heavy and fast-moving motor vehicles. Stop blaming cyclists, stop asking them to wear high-]]]

[[[viz]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[and helmets, stop victim-blaming. Focus efforts on reducing road danger from motor vehicles, rather than trying to increase safety of vulnerable road users in the face of ever-increasing road danger.]]]

[[[ 4.1.2]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Forget about adding mirrors and sensors to some ]]]

[[[lorries]]]

[[[.]]]

[[[ There will always be lorry drivers who accidentally fail to look in their mirrors, and sensors that will fail to detect cyclists about to be killed. Instead focus on sustainable safety, but keeping cyclists and ]]]

[[[lorries]]]

[[[ apart from each other at all times. ]]]

[[[Then the inevitable human failings will be much less likely to result in death or serious injury.]]]

[[[ 4.1.3]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Real-world research has already been carried out into all these aspects of cycling safety, and well-developed and proven solutions are already available. You ]]]

[[[only need to travel to a country that's nearer London than Scotland is, and where the people speak pretty good English, to see these solutions in action. Safety is when people aged 8 to 80 are free and happy to use bicycles for local transport in towns and]]]
