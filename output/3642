Written evidence from M. [bold]Wahlberg[bold] (HSR 024) [bold]&#xa0;[bold]Written evidence submitted by 
[normal]Madeleine Wahlberg in a personal capacity.
[normal] I am a member of the Offchurch Action Group against HS2.
[normal] 
[normal]I am neither a member of nor a donator to any political party and have no personal financial interest in any company or NGO. I am retired but was a university lecturer and researcher. 
[normal]I have taken a special interest in EC TEN-T policy
[normal] and in trans
[normal]-
[normal]European
[normal] 
[normal]citizen 
[normal]groups concerning HSR
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1 Summary[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2 Background[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1[bold] 
[normal] The most common response from MPs when asked a
[normal]bout the connection between 
[normal]HS2 and TEN-T policy is summed up by The Secretary of State for Transport who 
[normal]vehemently 
[normal]said 
[normal]“HS2 has nothing to do with Europe”
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] As this is patently untrue although oft repe
[normal]ated, it seems right to ask
[normal] why there is so littl
[normal]e 
[normal]understanding of TEN-T policy
[normal] 
[normal](or 
[normal]such 
[normal]a widespread refusal to 
[normal]openly 
[normal]acknowledge TEN-T policy); 
[normal]and whether the TSC has taken the same view or 
[normal]is by contrast fully aware of 
[normal]current 
[normal]TEN-T policy and its likely or possible impacts on the development of the 
[normal]HS2 proposal
[normal]?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2[bold] [bold] Assurance on 
[normal]TSC knowledge of TEN-T in relation to the HS2 proposal
[normal] 
[normal]would be particularly 
[normal]pertinent 
[normal]in the light of the
[normal] 
[normal]“
[normal]most radical overhaul of EU infrastructure policy since its inception
[normal]”
[normal] 
[normal]which has 
[normal]been agreed by the European Parli
[normal]ament
[normal] today
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3[bold]  
[normal]I wish to raise this issue specifically without raising any issues about whether the UK should 
[normal]or should not repatriate powers from, or
[normal] leave the EU. 
[normal]Nor am I
[normal] interested in 
[normal]scarem
[normal]o
[normal]ngering
[normal] about 
[normal]‘
[normal]EU control of UK transport policy
[normal]’
[normal].
[normal] Nor am I taking a view of whether TEN-T policy is 
[normal]itself 
[normal]either positive or negative. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3  [bold]Source of advice[bold] for TSC[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.1[bold]  
[normal]Given that 
[normal]it was the Secretary of State for Transport 
[normal]who
[normal] said 
[normal]“
[normal]HS2 has nothing to do with Europe
[normal]”
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]I do not
[normal] have confidence that the Department for Transport would be sufficiently informed about the latest TEN-T policy to provide TSC with 
[normal]an adequate
[normal] view of the issues in relation to 
[normal]the 
[normal]HS2
[normal] proposal
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2[bold]  As I have raised the issue of TEN-T policy on numerous
[normal] occasions with HS2
[normal] Ltd
[normal] staff, and have had ill-informed responses, I do not have the confidence th
[normal]at HS2 Ltd has any inkling of
[normal] the latest TEN-T policy
[normal] nor its potential impacts on HS2
[normal].
[normal]3.3[bold]  At the recent European Commission meeting on TEN-T policy that I
[normal] attended in Tallinn, 
[normal]EC staff who are central to the implementation of TEN-T had almost no understanding of the 
[normal]strategic 
[normal]case either for or against the HS2
[normal] proposal. I do not have confidence that they could adequately inform the TSC on the impacts of the
[normal] latest TEN-T policy on HS2. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4[bold]   
[normal]It is my view that 
[normal]t
[normal]he TSC should acquire an independent and informed view of the impact of the 
[normal]latest 
[normal]TEN-T policy 
[normal]on 
[normal]the HS2 proposal.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4[bold]  Possible issues of concern[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Four areas are suggested here 
[normal]as 
[normal]initial 
[normal]exemplars 
[normal]of issues that the TSC might wish to review
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1[bold]  
[normal]The reduction in priority for the ‘East Y’ arm of HS2
[normal]. The latest TEN-T maps no longer show the East Y with ‘Core’ status.
[normal] It is now not part of Core Corridor 8 (Cork to Marseilles). 
[normal]The line f
[normal]rom Birmingham to 
[normal]Leeds is now only shown with
[normal] lower ‘Comprehensive’ status. A possible reason for this 
[normal]‘
[normal]downgrading
[normal]’
[normal] or removal of Core status
[normal] is that it reflects a lowering of the priority to build the extension 
[normal]of HS2 
[normal]to Leeds. There is a commitment und
[normal]er TEN-T regulations that Core routes will be completed by 2030 but Comprehensive routes will only need to be implemented by 2050. Is the current status o
[normal]f the East Y a reflection of a
[normal] changed strategic case for HS2? Will this be reflected in a changed ana
[normal]lysis 
[normal]regarding
[normal] the 
[normal]inclusion
[normal] of WEIs
[normal] from the North East? 
[normal] 
[normal]Is this 
[normal]lower priority status for the East Y 
[normal]intended to reflect the way in which HS2 will be delivered cheaper and faster? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2[bold] 
[normal] 
[normal]In earlier 
[normal]phases of TEN-T policy
[normal],
[normal] the scheme that was identified
[normal] to
[normal] improve transport from
[normal] London northwards was the West Coast Main Line. This was then known as Priority Project (PP) 14. EC funds were allocated to the modernisation of WCML
[normal] 
[normal]and the 
[normal]EC 
[normal]singed it off as a 
[normal]“
[normal]completed
[normal]”
[normal] project.
[normal] HS2 is e
[normal]ssentially taking 
[normal]the TEN-T programme
[normal] back to the starting blocks
[normal] by introducing a second proposal on a similar route to the already completed scheme
[normal]. 
[normal]Are there any implications 
[normal]of this 
[normal]for the strategic cas
[normal]e for
[normal] 
[normal]HS2
[normal]?
[normal] 
[normal]Will this impact on the ability of HS2 to access EU CEF
[normal] 
[normal]funding for a
[normal] duplicate (HS2) proposal? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3[bold]  
[normal]The HS2 proposal under TEN-T will have to satisfy the EC that it is conforming to a number of ‘design criteria’ such as environmental sustainability, contribution to the carbon reduction targets, limitation o
[normal]n environmental damage
[normal], multi-modality
[normal] and the involvement 
[normal]of civic voice ‘from start to finish’.
[normal] Does the TSC feel that HS2 wi
[normal]ll be able to match up to such 
[normal]strategic 
[normal]criteria? What will be the implications for the strate
[normal]gic case of
[normal] HS2 (including the ch
[normal]oice of specific route)
[normal],
[normal] if HS2 as currently configured is not able to satisfy such criteria? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.[bold]4[bold] 
[normal]As part of the latest policy phase, TEN-T has agreed to a n
[normal]ew governance instrument
[normal] for each
[normal] Corridor
[normal] “
[normal]led
[normal]” by a co
[normal]ordinator appointed by the EC. This goes 
[normal]beyond the existing Forums that have existed for some time in order to achieve inter-operability. The intention is that this will ensure that each Corridor is planned, developed and managed 
[normal]as a whole, 
[normal]and 
[normal]on the basis of 
[normal]“
[normal]European Added V
[normal]alue
[normal]”
[normal] not nationa
[normal]l added value. 
[normal]How will such a new governance instrument impact on the strategic case for HS2? W
[normal]ill it 
[normal]impact on the ability 
[normal]to make 
[normal]str
[normal]ategic decisions 
[normal]with regard to HS2 eg 
[normal]with regard to ticket pricing, staffing, timetabl
[normal]ing, contracting for services;
[normal] or at a more policy level
[normal], will
[normal] it allow or prevent 
[normal]policies on eg a public service ethos; 
[normal]re-nationalised rail; the reintegration of services and infrastructure
[normal]?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Conclusion[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Th
[normal]is submission has argued that
[normal] the latest revision of TEN-T policy should be
[normal] acknowledged and understood. 
[normal]It is that policy that will provide the European context for HS2 as a European project. 
[normal]We need a more mature response than the 
[normal]frequently 
[normal]heated denial that there is any link between HS2 and TEN-T. 
[normal]W[bold]e need to understand what [bold]the UK is committed to under the [bold]2013 [bold]TEN-T policy and whether the HS2 proposal conforms to that[bold]. 
[normal]I hope that the TSC can take these issues forward.

[normal]   (p9) “
[normal]public interest should lead to a continuous communication that imp
[normal]lies a true involvement and would avoid the problems described.”
[normal] It seems clear from discussions on the various media that many commentators assume that the UK will be in full control over all of these decisions in relation to HS2. That is less self-evident since the latest agreement in the European Parliament.
