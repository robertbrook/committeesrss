"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;John Trevelyan – Written evidence&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by on the rights of way provisions in the Draft Deregulation Bill (Clauses 12 to 18 and Schedule 6)&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAmendments to the 'cut-off' provisions\nClauses\n 12, 13, 14 and Schedule 6 paragraphs 5 and 8 amend the \n'cut-off' provisions\n. Those provisions are contained in sections 53-56 of the 2000 Act and section 54A of the 1981 Act, but have not yet been commenced.\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAmendments to the public path order application provisions\nClauses 15 and 17 amend the provisions for applications for public path orders contained in section 118ZA, 118C, 119ZA, 119C and 121A-121E of the Highways Act 1980, none of which have yet been commenced.\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOther proposals\nOther \nprovisions are contained in Clause 16 and Schedule 6 paragraphs 2\n,3,4,6,7\n and 9.\n              \nCounty councils\n              \n27\n              \nMetropolitan district councils\n              \n36\n              \nShire \nunitaries\n              \n55\n              \nOuter \nLondon\n boroughs\n              \n20\n              \nTOTAL\n              \n138\n              \n&#xa0;\n              \nShire districts\n              \n201\n              \nNational park authorities and Broads Authority\n              \n10\n              \nInner \nLondon\n boroughs and City of \nLondon\n              \n13\n              \nsub-total\n              \n224\n              \nTotal number of authorities with \npath order-making powers\n              \n362\n              \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nImplementation of the cut-off provisions will be a major project. \nDefra's\n estimates (in the Impact Assessment) are that there will be 20,000 additional applications, costing local authorities on average £2,900 to determine. That adds up to £58 million, with extra costs to be added for both central and local government in order-making and dealing with appeals against refused applications and with objections to orders. The total cost to the public purse could easily be £100 million. \nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSuch a major project justifies proper management. But not only are there no plans in place: the provisions in the Bill for the Secretary of State's jurisdiction over applications for directions to be transferred to the courts (Schedule 6 paragraph 6(4)), and for applications to be recorded in the register only after the preliminary assessment (Schedule 6 paragraph 4) means that keeping track of what is happening will be much more difficult than would otherwise be the case.\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the Explanatory Notes (\npara\n 64) it is acknowledged that \"The investigations of applications based on evidence about the position before 1949 can be very difficult for authorities\". That difficulty, which will apply also to applicants, may well lead to applicants erring on the side of caution and submitting applications for routes that would not, in practice, be extinguished at the cut-off date.\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe increased complexity of dealing with applications made after the cut-off date - judging whether a right of way existed in 1949 and, if so, whether it was extinguished at the cut-off date or whether an exemption from extinguishment applied - will give rise to increased, continuing, costs for both local and central government. \ne)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 extinguished rights for mechanically-propelled vehicles in certain circumstances, essentially a trial run of similar provisions. It has led to extra work considering whether exemptions apply and several court cases on its interpretation. The greater extent and complexity of the cut-off provisions in the 2000 Act suggests that the extra work involved will be significant.\nf)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe main purpose of the provisions was supposed to be greater certainty. But this must be questionable, as the lack of resources means progress will be slow. \nDefra\n is estimating that there will be 20,000 additional applications, which means an average of 2,000 per year. There is no evidence that authorities will be able to cope with anything like that number. If so, many thousands will remain undetermined at the cut-off date, and it will be many years before they are all resolved, with \nal\n the associated uncertainty. \ng)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMoreover the proposals in the Bill on preliminary assessment of applications and associated delays in recording in the register mean that many of those will be hidden from public view by not being in the public register, nor will they have been notified to landowners, with consequent implications for property sales. Furthermore the provisions do not extinguish rights over ways that might be considered to have the greatest impact on landowners - ways not presently recorded at all, but which qualify to be recorded as either byways open to all traffic or restricted byways.\nh)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever the Act is worded that if a footpath or bridleway that existed as a public right of way in 1949 is not recorded on the definitive map at the cut-off date it will be extinguished (unless an exemption applies). This means that in any question about the status of a way after the cut-off date the starting point is that the rights were extinguished unless it can be shown that the right of way did not exist in 1949 or that an exemption applies. The difficulty of ascertaining the status in 1949 is accepted by \nDefra\n (see above): the exemptions are in section 54 of the 2000 Act (which I, as a practitioner with many years' experience, find very difficult to understand) and possibly in regulations. \nDefra\n has not published any draft regulations, so it is impossible to judge what effect any regulations might have.\ni)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe extinguishment of footpaths and bridleways is likely to have a particular effect in urban areas, where many such ways (mostly footpaths) are often not currently recorded on definitive maps. The Act provides no exemption for ways that are in regular daily use, \nnor\n for those that are maintained by the local authority at public expense, so the only certain safeguard will be recording of the way on the definitive map. I consider that there are many thousands of such ways in regular daily use by people going to school, shops, work, etc that will be put at risk by implementation of the cut-off provisions. They range from centuries-old routes in towns and cities to ways on housing estates built in the 1930s.\nj)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLocal authorities that are highway authorities have a duty to keep an up-to-date list of those ways that are publicly maintainable, including footpaths and bridleways. They use that information not only to plan their maintenance work, but also, for example, to answer questions related to property transfer. At the cut-off date, there will be considerable uncertainty about the status of footpaths and bridleways included in that list: do authorities amend the list, or, if they continue to maintain ways where the rights have been extinguished, will they be spending money unlawfully?\nk)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe implementation of the cut-off provisions does not have universal support. The Equestrian Access Forum, whose members are the British Horse Society, the Byways and Bridleways Trust, the British Driving Society, the National Federation of Bridleway Associations and the South Pennine Packhorse Trails Trust, published a report in \n2012 \nMaking Ways\n for Horses\n, \nin which\n \nproposal 2 was the repeal of the cut-off provisions.\nClause 12 \nClause 13\n&#xa0;\nClause 14\n&#xa0;\nSchedule 6 paragraphs 5 and 8\n (modification consent orders)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nModifications arising from administrative errors (Sch\nedule\n 6 \npara\ngraph\n 3)\n&#xa0;\nDefinitive map modification\n order\n applications and appeals (Sch\nedule\n 6 para\ngraph\ns 4 and 6)\n&#xa0;\nPreliminary assessment of applications\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nExamine \nthe \napplication and associated evidence\n.\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nResearch any documentary evidence relied on by the applicant but for which copies have not been supplied under sub-paragraph 1(3).\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHaving regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State, decide whether the application and the evidence show that there is a reasonable basis for the applicant's belief that the map and statement should be modified.\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNotify the applicant of the decision.\ne)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf the decision is that there is a reasonable basis (\nDefra\n expects \nthis to occur \n90% of the time), investigate who are the owners and occupiers of all the land to which the application relates, and serve notice on them.\nDealing with non-determination of an application\n&#xa0;\nOther detailed comments\n&#xa0;\nPublicity for definitive map and public path orders (Sch\nedule\n 6 para\ngraph\ns 7 and 9)\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is a lack of consistency, in that these will be the only provisions that enable a change to be made to rights of way to be advertised in this way. See Appendix 2 for a full list of provisions and current publicity requirements.\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe alternative proposed is very weak, in that there is no way of knowing when\n              \n an order will be publicised or where to look on a council's website.\n\"T\nhe Government has decided not to take forward this amendment. This means that the statutory requirement to publish certain applications in newspapers remains. It is clear from the responses that some members of the public and community groups rely on the statutory notices in newspapers to learn about planning applications in their area. The Government is not convinced that good alternative arrangements can be readily rolled out.\n\"\n&#xa0;\n15 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nBirmingham\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nEssex\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nLeicestershire\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nLuton\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNorthamptonshire\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNorthumberland \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNorth Tyneside\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSouthend\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWarwickshire \n&#xa0;\nPowers to create, divert or extinguish public rights of way and the requirements for giving public notice&#xa0;\nStatutory provisionRequirements for giving public noticeDefence Act 1842 s 16 \nNone\nDefence Act 1860 s 40 \nNone\nMilitary Lands Act 1892 s 13\nLondon Gazette and local newspaper\nLand Powers (Defence) Act 1958 s 8\nLondon Gazette and local newspaper\nHarbours Act 1964 \nss\n 14 and 16 \nLondon Gazette, local advertisement and such other ways as the Secretary of State may direct\nHighways Act 1980 s 14 \nLondon Gazette and local newspaper\nHighways Act 1980 s 18\n&#xa0;\nLondon Gazette and local newspaper\nHighways Act 1980 s 26\n&#xa0;\nCurrently : local newspaper \nProposed: website maintained by the order-making authority\nHighways Act 1980 s 116 \nLondon Gazette and local newspaper \nHighways Act 1980 s 118\n&#xa0;\nCurrently : local newspaper \nProposed: website maintained by the order-making authority\nHighways Act 1980 s 118A \nCurrently : local newspaper \nProposed: website maintained by the order-making authority\nHighways Act 1980 s 118B \nCurrently : local newspaper \nProposed: website maintained by the order-making authority\nHighways Act 1980 s 119\n&#xa0;\nCurrently : local newspaper \nProposed: website maintained by the order-making authority\nHighways Act 1980 s 119A \nCurrently : local newspaper \nProposed: website maintained by the order-making authority\nHighways Act 1980 s 119B \nCurrently : local newspaper \nProposed: website maintained by the order-making authority\nHighways Act 1980 s 119D \nCurrently : local newspaper \nProposed: website maintained by the order-making authority\nLocal Government, Planning and Land Act 1980 Sch\nedule\n 28\nIn such manner as appears to the Secretary of State to be requisite\nAcquisition of Land Act 1981 s 32 \nCurrently : local newspaper \nProposed: website maintained by the order-making authority\nNew Towns Act 1981 s 23 \nIn such manner as appears to the Secretary of State to be requisite\nCivil Aviation Act 1982 s 48 \nLondon Gazette and local newspaper\nCycle Tracks Act 1984 s 3\n&#xa0;\nLocal newspaper\nHousing Act 1985 s 294\nLocal newspaper\nAirports Act 1986 s 59 \nLondon Gazette and local newspaper\nHousing Act 1988 \nSch\n 10\n&#xa0;\nIn such manner as appears to the Secretary of State to be requisite\nTown and Country Planning Act 1990 s 247 \nLondon Gazette and local newspaper\nTown and Country Planning Act 1990 s 248\nLondon Gazette and local newspaper \nTown and Country Planning Act 1990 s 249\nLondon Gazette and local newspaper\nTown and Country Planning Act 1990 s 251\nLondon Gazette and local newspaper\nTown and Country Planning Act 1990 s 257\nLocal newspaper\nTown and Country Planning Act 1990 s 258\nLocal newspaper\nTown and Country Planning Act 1990 s 261\nLocal newspaper and also London Gazette if order made under section 247 provisions by Secretary of State or \nLondon\n borough council\nWater Industry Act 1991 s 167 SOS\nLondon Gazette and local newspaper\nWater Resources Act\n1991 s 167\nLondon Gazette and local newspaper\nTransport and Works Act 1992 \nss\n 1,3\nLondon Gazette and local newspaper\nLeasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 \nSch\n 20\nIn such manner as appears to the Secretary of State to be requisite\nRegional Development Agencies Act 1998 \nSch\n 6\nIn such manner as appears to the Secretary of State to be requisite\nPlanning Act 2008 s 136\nLondon Gazette, local and national newspaper\nPrivate and Local Act of Parliament\nLondon Gazette and local newspaper\n&#xa0;\n1\n&#xa0;\n"
