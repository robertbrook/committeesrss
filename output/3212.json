We would like to see more opportunities for communities to take on ownership of land and to derive the greatest benefits from doing so. \n&#xa0;\nWe welcome\n this inquiry into Land Reform in Scotland\n and many of the suggestions in the \ninquiry discussion paper relating to community ownership.\n \n&#xa0;\nWe are \nalso \nactively engaging with the Scottish Government on the proposed \nCommunity Empowerment and Renewal Bill and we have submitted \nevidence\n to the Scottish Government Land Reform Review Group.\n&#xa0;We have seen how c\nommunity ownership of land or other local assets c\nan have a transformative effect in \ncommunities. \nHalf a million \nacres of land are now in \ncommunity ownership in Scotland resulting in repopulation; new homes; new b\nusinesses; and\n a new sense of conf\nidence, energy and opportunity. \n&#xa0;Our own research has shown that it can be a\n powerful catalyst for a wide range of social, environmental and economic improvements in local communities\n with a positive impact on individual and community wellbeing\n. \n&#xa0;\nOur experience has shown that the ben\nefits of community ownership and/ or management\n \ncan be:\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThere is great potential for more rural and urban communities across Scotland to access the many benefits that owning and controlling local assets, including land\n,\n can offe\nr. \n&#xa0;\nWe \nwould\n \ntherefore \nwelcome the introduction of measures that would make ‘\nit easier for communities to take ownership of land and other assets\n’ and ‘\nmeasures intended to facilitate and make easier the transfer of land and other assets in public ownership to co\nmmunities and others’\n.\n&#xa0;Improving wellbeing through increased community ownership– 6 recommendations&#xa0;\nWe\n have identified a package of six\n recommendations\n that we believe need to be in place in order to deliver improved community and individual wellbeing for \nScottish \ncommunities through ownership\n and/or management\n of \nland and \nlocal assets. While each component below is important in its own right the full be\nnefits of each measure can only be derived if all are in place\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;October 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;"
