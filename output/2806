[normal]The Highways Agency is responsible for the strategic road network in 
[normal]England
[normal], covering more than 4,300 miles of motorways and trunk roads.  The Agency delivers a robust 
[normal]winter service that has been developed over a number of years, with significant improvements introduced following previous reviews and lessons learned.  The Agency is well prepared for winter weather.

[normal]Resilience of the Strategic Road Network[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Ensuring resilience of the strategic road network is a challenge during times of severe weather
[normal], especially as 
[normal]weather conditions can be unpredictable and change quickly.  High traffic volumes and congestion, particularly at peak times, can make keeping th
[normal]e network open during severe weather difficult.  However, this is what the Agency aims to achieve and it has done so consistently over recent years with only very isolated problems at times of exceptionally extreme weather.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Following a spell of particularly cold and snowy weather in mid-late January 2013 the 
[normal]RAC
[normal] Foundation commissioned a review into how highway authorities coped with the conditions.  
[normal]The report, entitled ‘
[normal]Ploughing On: A review of highway resilience in 
[normal]Winter
[normal] 2013
[normal]’
[normal], 
[normal]also 
[normal]consider
[normal]ed
[normal] the 
[normal]response to the 
[normal]further heavy snow in March, which was the coldest for 51 years.  
[normal]The 
[normal]report 
[normal]comment
[normal]ed 
[normal]that “…the Highways Agency responded well to the recent periods of snow and ice
[normal]”.  It 
[normal]also concluded that
[normal], due to the impleme
[normal]ntation of the recommendations from various reviews, 
[normal]there is much stronger underlying 
[normal]resilience than 
[normal]was the case in 2009-10
[normal].

[normal]Lessons Learn[bold]ed[bold] and Changes Made[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]One of the most significant changes made since the winter of 2009-10 has been the establishme
[normal]nt of a strategic salt stockpile
[normal], which has substantially increased the resilience of salt stocks
[normal].  This has been delivered by the Highways Agency in conjunction with the Department, following the recommendations of the Independent Review of England’s Transport System in 
[normal]Winter
[normal] (2010).  Over 500,000 tonnes of 
[normal]salt
[normal] were imported into 
[normal]England
[normal] in the win
[normal]ter of 2010-11 which helped to provide 
[normal]resilience at a time of 
[normal]widespread 
[normal]salt shortage.  Since then, the Agency has continued to maintain strategic stockpiles amounting to 425,000 tonnes, of which 12
[normal]0
[normal],000 tonnes 
[normal](representing 6.7 capability days
[normal]) 
[normal]are all
[normal]ocated for the strategic road network and around 305,000 tonnes
[normal] held 
[normal]for local authorities.
[normal] 
[normal]The strategic stockpile will only be used as a last resort in the event that domestic salt 
[normal]supplies are 
[normal]unable to meet demand
[normal],
[normal] and as such 
[normal]continues to 
[normal]play a key r
[normal]ole in ensuring a high level of resilience in national salt stocks.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Highways Agency has implemented many 
[normal]other 
[normal]improvements since the winter of 2009-10, based on a robust lessons learned process and imple
[normal]me
[normal]ntation of the recommendations from
[normal] winter resilience 
[normal]reviews including the Transport Select 
[normal]Committee report 
[normal]‘Keeping the UK Moving: The Impact on Transport of the Winter Weather in December 2010’.  
[normal]The improvements made have 
[normal]also 
[normal]taken
[normal] knowledge and learning 
[normal]gained 
[normal]from our active role on
[normal] the winter service technical committee of the World Road Association together with our partnership agreement with the Netherlands and Belgium. In addition we share experiences and lessons nationally with transport operators of other modes including 
[normal]N
[normal]ation
[normal]al 
[normal]R
[normal]ail, T
[normal]ransport for 
[normal]London
[normal] and airports
[normal].

[normal]Completion 
[normal](in June 2010) 
[normal]of the roll-out of 
[normal]the Agency’s new fleet of 437 specialised 
[normal]winter service 
[normal]vehicles.
[normal] These spread pre-wetted salt which acts more quickly
[normal] and
[normal] 
[normal]stays on the road longer
[normal], delivering a more effective and sustainable treatment. 
[normal]The 
[normal]vehicles
[normal] are all equipped with data logging systems which, in addition to GPS location information, record vehicle speed, salt spread rates, ploughing condition and other 
[normal]vehicle operating conditions.

[normal]Salt Stock Management
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Improvements to operational salt stock management, 
[normal]resilience
[normal] and 
[normal]monitoring
[normal] has taken place
[normal], allowing early identification of salt stock issues.
[normal]  The
[normal] Agency’s 
[normal]stock monitoring sy
[normal]s
[normal]tem
[normal] is a
[normal]lso use
[normal]d
[normal] by 
[normal]the Department and 
[normal]local highway authorities
[normal] to give a better full national picture.

[normal]Severe Weather Plans
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]T
[normal]he Agency’s severe weather plans
[normal],
[normal] which 
[normal]our 
[normal]service providers are required to complete each year
[normal] for each area
[normal], have undergone substantial revision
[normal].
[normal] Improvements include the identification of vulnerable locations on the network, which are particularly susceptible to 
[normal]disruption from severe weather
[normal]. Key transport hubs such as Heathrow and 
[normal]Manchester
[normal] airports are considered in the preparation of the pla
[normal]ns
[normal]. 
[normal]Mitigation plans are in place to deal with problems at these locations and may include measures such as pre-positioning of salt spreaders with ploughs, traffic officer and heavy recovery vehicles, multi-agency response arrangements (police
[normal] and 
[normal]local au
[normal]thorities) and contingency plans. 
[normal]An example is the 
[normal]multi-agency response 
[normal]plan in place for the A38 
[normal]Haldon
[normal] Hill and A328 Telegraph Hill in Devon, just south of 
[normal]Exeter
[normal], which was successfully implemented several times during the 2012-13 winter season.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Furt
[normal]her improvements 
[normal]made 
[normal]to the severe weather plans include the provision of guidance for treating the network in extreme cold conditions and additional measures to ensure the 
[normal]resilience
[normal] of Agency depots.

[normal]Highways Agency Weather Information Service
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]For the
[normal] 2012-13 winter season t
[normal]he Agency introduced its new 
[normal]weather i
[normal]nformation 
[normal]s
[normal]ervice, which 
[normal]takes data from more than 240 weather stations on the strategic road network, together with forecast information, and makes that information available to its service pr
[normal]oviders and others to enable them to make informed decisions on how to respond to severe weather. I
[normal]n addition, the Agency has a Met Office forecaster embedded in the National Traffic Operations Centre during the winter period
[normal] which
[normal] enables
[normal] us
[normal] 
[normal]to send out t
[normal]argeted severe weather warnings and alerts to all interested stakeholders 
[normal]so that 
[normal]appropriate actions 
[normal]can
[normal] be taken
[normal].
[normal]  We 
[normal]provide the Met Office (and other 
[normal]partners)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]with
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]all
[normal] 
[normal]observation data and camera imagery
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]received from 
[normal]our
[normal] weather stations under a defi
[normal]ned data exchange agreement

[normal]Amber Alert Process
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]T
[normal]he Agency introduced an ‘amber alert’ process for snow in 2011 that provides freight operators and others with advance targeted notice of 
[normal]when there is a significant risk of disruption to the network from snow. 
[normal]This is supported by 
[normal]variable 
[normal]message signs on the network to provide advance warning to road users of 
[normal]when 
[normal]severe weather
[normal] is expected.  This is
[normal] supplemented by messages on the Agency
[normal]’s website and 
[normal]social media.

[normal]Communications &amp; Marketing Campaign
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Since winter 2009/10, the Highways Agency has undertaken a comprehensive partnership marketing campaign and has worked closely with over 100 key partners
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]- including the AA, RAC, Institute 
[normal]of Advanced Motorists (IAM), Road Haulage Association (RHA) and the Freight Transport Association (FTA), local authorities
[normal] and
[normal] airports to deliver winter messages through partners’ own communications channels, such as websites, newsletters, posters and soc
[normal]ial media channels.
[normal]  Each year t
[normal]he Agency continues to implement a comprehensive winter communication campaign
[normal],
[normal] working with key partners including the Met Office and Cabinet Office as part of the wider ‘
[normal]Get ready for [bold]Winter[bold]’ campaign.

[normal]Use of Social 
[normal]Media
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Agency has also developed its use of social media including its dedicated winter twitter channel (@
[normal]winterhighways
[normal]) and has introduced a 
[normal]Facebook
[normal] page at 
[normal]Facebook.com/
[normal]winterhighways
[normal]. These media 
[normal]help
[normal] the Agency to 
[normal]put across key messages, includi
[normal]ng information on road conditions and weather alerts, to a wider audience than before.

[normal]Crisis Management Manual
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Highways Agency Crisis Management Manual (CMM) 
[normal]is an internal document 
[normal]launched in November 2011 and 
[normal]last 
[normal]updated in July 2013. 
[normal]It sets ou
[normal]t policy and guidance for how the Agency 
[normal]and its service providers 
[normal]manage severe disruptive events that affect the strategic road network. 
[normal]Key changes relate to management and reporting 
[normal]in advance of, and during, 
[normal]widespread events, 
[normal]the 
[normal]availability of 
[normal]crisis management expertise and business continuity.

[normal]2.2.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Although numerous improvements have been made to the way the Highways Agency plans for and responds to severe winter weather, 
[normal]we accept the need to avoid 
[normal]complacency. The Agency has a
[normal] well
[normal] established lessons learned programme 
[normal]specifically 
[normal]for winter service, which feeds into the issue of the latest Severe Weather Plan for each area. In this way the Agency continuously review
[normal]s
[normal] its performance, learning lessons from each winter period, and m
[normal]aking improvements.

[normal]2.3.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The
[normal] Highways Agency is well prepared for the coming winter.  
[normal]O
[normal]perational salt stocks 
[normal]will stand at 
[normal]around 270,000 tonnes 
[normal](representing 15 capability days) 
[normal]by the end of October, in line with the past 
[normal]two years
[normal], and more than at the start of the 2010-11 season.
[normal]  In addition we continue to hold 120,000 tonnes of strategic salt.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Agency is currently finalising its preparations for its winter driving campaign ‘Make time for winter’, which will commenc
[normal]e on 28 October. 
[normal]The 
[normal]campaign 
[normal]will
[normal] encourage road users to prepare for their journeys, to plan by checking traffic and weather before they set out and then to adjust their travel plans and their driving style according to the conditions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] We are working wi
[normal]th key partners and stakeholders to maximise the reach of the campaign and to increase the impact of messages. Partner agencies such as DVLA and VOSA/DSA are supporting this with their own communications channels
[normal].  W
[normal]e are working with motoring organisation
[normal]s, freight transport organisations, the Confederation of Passenger Transport, local authorities and a number of large private sector organisations to help promote the key messages of "Be prepared: is your vehicle ready for winter?" and "Be informed: have y
[normal]ou checked the latest traffic and weather?"
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Following the experience of running the campaign in previous winters 
[normal]the Agency
[normal] will be increasing the flexibility of the campaign so we can respond quickly to the different challenges of varying weather pattern
[normal]s. Our significant use of online communications and social media is particularly suited to this type of agile and responsive campaign
[normal].
[normal]  Our media spokespeople 
[normal]also
[normal] play an important role 
[normal]du
[normal]ring peak periods of severe weather by providing interviews to the 
[normal]media
[normal], both broadcast and press.  W
[normal]e will also facilitate 
[normal]media 
[normal]visits to our control centres and depots where it is appropriate to do so and does not compromise operational delivery
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The
[normal] Highways Agency campaign sits within the wider cross-government 
[normal]‘Get Ready for 
[normal]Winter
[normal]’ 
[normal]campaign. This is hosted by the Met Office and co-ordinated by the Cabinet Office to include key Government departments/agencies, the health and voluntary sectors to provide advice and support on a wide range of weather related issue
[normal]s.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Links between the partners will further increase the reach of our particular messages related to travel during severe weather.

[normal]Coordinating Responses[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Agency recognises the importance of coordinating its planning and operational response with othe
[normal]r authorities, such as the police and local highway authorities.  Severe weather plans require service providers to consult with adjacent local authorities to ensure, among other things, that planned treatment routes are coordinated and that there is shari
[normal]ng of information on treatment 
[normal]decision
[normal] making.  Local authorities take part in annual 
[normal]severe weather desk exer
[normal]cises and briefings are provided.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There is an established procedure for the provision of mutual aid during the winter season.  For example, last
[normal] winter the Agency provided a 
[normal]snow plough
[normal] and driver to Cumbria County Council to assist wit
[normal]h
[normal] snow clearance 
[normal]following
[normal] heavy snowfalls at the end of March. 
[normal] 
[normal]In some locations salt barns are shared with local authorities 
[normal]which
[normal] provides a benefit to both par
[normal]ties. Furthermore, the Agency works with police and local highway authorities as part of Local Resilience Forums, which play a key coordination role at times of significant disruption to the network from any cause, including severe weather.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]October 2013
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] One capability day is based on 6 treatments of 20g per sq metre on all routes which is considered to be the maximum scale of treatment under the most extreme weather conditions.
