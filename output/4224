[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The Questions[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]What should the BBC be for, and what should b[bold]e the purpose of public service [bold]broadcasting[bold]?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How well has the BBC performed in the [bold]current[bold] Charter period in achieving its mission and public purposes?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Are the public purposes in the current Charter the right ones? How might they change?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What scope, scale and remit should the BBC have? [bold]Should [bold]the BBC’s output and services be provided to any greater or lesser degree for particular audiences? [bold]W[bold]hat balance should be struck in what the BBC produces in-house, commissions externally and leaves entirely to others to create?[bold]How have the BBC’s commercial activities during the current Charter fitted with the BBC’s public purposes and have they achieved an adequate return for licence fee payers? What should be the aims, scope and scale of such activities beyond 2016?[bold]What role should the BBC play in developing technology and new ways of distributing content?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How should the BBC be funded beyond [bold]2016? [bold]Is there a case for distributing funding for [bold]public service content more widely beyond the BBC?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What comparisons can be made with the[bold] provision of public service content in other countries? [bold]How should the BBC be governed, regulated and held accountable beyond 2016?[bold]In a constantly evolving communications environment, does a 10-year Royal Charter and Agreement with the Secretary of State, together, provide the most appropriate constitutional [bold]framework for the BBC?[bold]&#xa0;
