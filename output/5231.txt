[[[)]]]

[[[Background]]]KWT is an independent National Voluntary Organisation with Charitable Status.&#xa0; We are one of Wales’ largest and most effective environmental charities, covering the whole of Wales and influencing a wide range of organisations and communities. Our approach leads to sustainable change through influencing behaviour and enabling individuals, groups and schools to take their own actions. &#xa0;Our focus is on people and their connections with the environment. We deal with far more than litter; our work encompasses biodiversity, access and recreation, health improvement, food growing, beach awards, Eco-Schools, Young Reporter for the Environment and so forth. Our work is underpinned by research and policy work including; Local Environmental Quality Surveys and developing advice for Government and other stakeholders.&#xa0;In relation to the forthcoming charge for plastic bags in England, KWT would like to put forward the following evidence based on our experience in relation to the SUCB levy in Wales.  KWT continues to support the SUCB levy on the grounds that it both protects and improves our environment.  It has successfully reduced the consumption of carrier bags in Wales, and therefore the impact they have in manufacture and disposal (including litter). Meanwhile the proceeds of the levy are making a tangible difference to many charitable causes, including environmental projects.The SUCB levy came into being in Wales on 1st October 2011. KWT was fully supportive of the Welsh Government in introducing the levy and the evidence below sets out our reasons for continued support, as well as suggestions moving forward. KWT understands that the Welsh Government is to review the policy in November 2014, at which point KWT will submit further evidence.In terms of usage, 8.1bn single-use carrier bags were used in the UK in 2012; a 1.3% rise on the previous year. However, regional differences show that

[[[period by 76%]]]. In the same time frame, the number of bags used per person per month in Wales reduced from 7.4 to 1.8. Welsh Government information based on 13 retailers shows further reductions in carrier bag use of between 35-96% after the introduction of the levy. This range suggests that some retail sectors, particularly food service and fashion, are harder to tackle than others - and that targeted work may be needed for further improvements.   In measuring the success of the scheme, the Welsh Government has commissioned research to understand the extent of the reduction in bag use generated, and to understand how the general public feels about the levy.  The levy has been seen to increase own bag use in Wales from 61% to 82%. Over this period public support for the levy has also increased: from 59% to 80%. KWT has observed a decrease in littered carrier bags through our Local Environmental Audit and Management System LEAMS street data, albeit only marginal. In the full survey year prior to the introduction of the levy carrier bags were found on an average of 1.1% of each local authority’s streets. Since the introduction of the levy that figure has dropped to 0.9%. The percentage of streets littered with carrier bags has reduced in 12 of the 22 local authorities and remained the same in a further four.Meanwhile KWT has long recognised that street-data is likely to significantly understate the extent of littered carrier bags. This owes to the physical properties of carrier bags which render them not readily degradable, meaning they persist for long periods in the environment and are easily transportable by weather, causing wide dispersal. Keep Wales Tidy staff and volunteers routinely remove bags that have blown into trees and along river banks.

[[[Proceeds from the Charge]]]The Waste (Wales) Measure 2010 gives Welsh Ministers the power create regulations which would impose duties on retailers on the destination of proceeds from the charge. However this has not been used; instead the Welsh Government advocates a voluntary agreement and the success of this agreement is to be measured by meeting the principles that:-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The net proceeds are passed on to good causes.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Where possible, the net proceeds will benefit Wales.&#xa0;The small number of businesses across Wales found to be failing to enforce the charge has been seen as a marker of the scheme’s success. The proceeds from the charge are making a substantial difference in Wales, with 100s of thousands of pounds already being pledged to ‘good causes’.

[[[Going Forward]]]KWT should like to see data on usage and street cleanliness continuously monitored. If support for the levy waivers, then it may be necessary to reinforce the messages which have, so far, succeeded in gaining support. It may also be beneficial to publicise the good causes that benefit from the proceeds of the charge, including amongst retailers.Experience from the Republic of Ireland suggests that as time goes on, people may get used to paying for bags and, as such, bag use may rise. Should this prove to be the case then consideration should be given to increasing the value of the charge. KWT has previously stated that a cost of up to 15p would be reasonable. &#xa0;In addition, we’d like to include information on the current debate in Wales relating to bags for life linked to the proposed Environment Bill.The ‘Towards the Sustainable Management of Wales’ Natural Resources’ White Paper proposes to extend the enabling powers of the Welsh Ministers so that they may, by regulations, provide for minimum charges to be set for other types of carrier bags in addition to single use carrier bags.KWT agrees with this proposal due to the increased use and disposal of, for example bags for life, and the detrimental effect that these can have on the environment.However, we recognise the aims of the levy will have failed if the charge and distribution of funding goes on forever, as the key aim is change behaviour - reduce waste and litter and the negative environmental impacts.&#xa0; http://www.wrap.org.uk/content/wrap-publishes-new-figures-carrier-bag-use  http://www.wrap.org.uk/content/wrap-publishes-new-figures-carrier-bag-usehttp://wales.gov.uk/topics/environmentcountryside/epq/waste_recycling/substance/carrierbags/reduction/?lang=enhttp://wales.gov.uk/topics/environmentcountryside/epq/waste_recycling/substance/carrierbags/attituderesearch/?lang=en http://www.carrierbagchargewales.gov.uk/retailers/reportingback/?lang=en Only six businesses found in breach of the carrier bag charge’, The Western Mail, 10/09/12‘Carrier bag charge reduces bag handout by up to 96%’, The Western Mail, 18/07/12
