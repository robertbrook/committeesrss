[normal]Written evidence from [bold]Guide Dogs [bold](LTD0014)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.1 
[normal]P
[normal]ublic transport is essential in allowing disabled people to live independent and active lives. Guide Dogs is an organisation dedicated to improving the independent mobility of blind and partially sighted people and, as such, we have considerable experience
[normal] 
[normal]in this area 
[normal]and a body of evidence of the experiences of this group in using transport. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2 
[normal]Guide Dogs campaigns on transport issues which affect our service users both locally and nationally. In particular we campaign for buses to be made accessible t
[normal]o blind and partially sighted people through the fitting of audio-visual 
[normal](AV) 
[normal]announcements and for streets to be accessibly 
[normal]designed 
[normal]and 
[normal]kept 
[normal]free from clutter. Guide Dogs has concerns about 
[normal]how 
[normal]changes in 
[normal]local transport 
[normal]decision-making structures will a
[normal]ffect 
[normal]these 
[normal]accessibility
[normal] issues
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3 
[normal]In our capacity as a mobility organisation
[normal], we have a particular interest in
[normal]:
[normal]Our response is therefore
[normal] focused on
[normal] the Committee’s questions 
[normal]which relate
[normal] to these areas.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2 [bold]What is the rationale for the Government’s proposals to devolve to a local [bold]level decision [bold]making on transport expenditure? What are [bold]the advantages and disadvantages of the Government’s approach? Are there better models?[bold]2.1 
[normal]Devolution and localism are desirable objective
[normal]s
[normal] inasmuch as they provide greater flexibility to meet the needs of the local population.
[normal] However, there is a risk th
[normal]at the needs of minority groups within these local populations will not be taken into account
[normal] in 
[normal]funding 
[normal]decisions
[normal]. D
[normal]evolution has to be in the context of prevailing national standards for the accessibility of vehicles, infrastructure and networks. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2 
[normal]I
[normal]n the real world, travel is not confined by local authority 
[normal]or LEP 
[normal]boundaries and people with sight loss need to have the confidence that certain accessibility standards will be upheld throughout their journey. 
[normal]A door-to-door
[normal] journey is only as ac
[normal]cessible 
[normal]as its weakest link. This can be illustrated 
[normal]through the current situation on 
[normal]AV announcements: though trains are equipped with AV technology, this brings no benefit to a blind person if their bus to the station is not. If 
[normal]they 
[normal]cannot be confident of safel
[normal]y travelling to the station, then the whole journey becomes 
[normal]effectively 
[normal]inaccessible.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3 Guide Dogs concern is that u
[normal]nless national standards are imposed, 
[normal]i.e.
[normal] 
[normal]a requirement for AV
[normal] a
[normal]nnouncements on all buses across the UK, this type of accessibility im
[normal]provement may become 
[normal]the sort of 'minor' issue which would 
[normal]be
[normal] scrimped and saved on 
[normal]by a local body 
[normal]at the last minute to avoid budget over-runs.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4 
[normal]A recent report by the National Audit Office on Funding and Structures for Local Economic Growth showed 
[normal]that 
[normal]there is no plan to measure outcomes or evaluate performance comparably across different local growth progress. It also noted that 
[normal]LEPs were mak
[normal]ing progress at different rates:
[normal] 
[normal]“Some partnerships continue to face significant capacity issues, a factor
[normal] exacerbated by the recent step change in the demands placed upon them through introducing the Growth Deals and new responsibilities for EU structural funds.”
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5 
[normal]Th
[normal]ese regional differences between LEPs will result in patchwork provision of transport, 
[normal]including accessibility improvements, reducing the ability of blind and partially sighted people to travel across th
[normal]e country safely and with confidence
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.0 [bold]What impact will the devolution in 2015 of funding to Local Transport Bodies and the introductio[bold]n of the Single Local Growth Fund have?[bold]3.1 
[normal]Guide Dogs is concerned that the introduction of the Single Local Growth Fund 
[normal]could result in less funding for transport projects overall. Our understanding is that the Department for Transport is the 
[normal]biggest
[normal] dep
[normal]artmental
[normal] 
[normal]contributor to the 
[normal]Single Local Growth Fund – contributing £1.9bn of funding. Most relevant to Guide Dogs is that 
[normal]£100m of 
[normal]this is from the 
[normal]Local 
[normal]Sustainable Transport Fund
[normal], a fund
[normal] 
[normal]for smaller projects 
[normal]which could
[normal], for example,
[normal] be used to equip b
[normal]uses with AV. The money paid by the DfT into the 
[normal]Single Local Growth 
[normal]Fund is not ring-fenced so it is possible that some of the DfT’s
[normal] money
[normal] could be
[normal] used for other local projects unrelated to transport.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.0 [bold]How clear are the lines of accountability for [bold]local decision making on transport expenditure?[bold]4.1 
[normal]T
[normal]he establishment of the £2b
[normal]n Single Local Growth F
[normal]u
[normal]nd and the transfer of decision 
[normal]making in respect of this fund to 
[normal]LEPs 
[normal]will increase the
[normal] part that LEPs
[normal] 
[normal]play 
[normal]in taking local transport decisions. Guide 
[normal]Dogs is concerned about the accountability of LEPs and their obligations with regard to the Public Sector Equality Duty.
[normal] 
[normal]The 
[normal]Public Sector Equality Duty
[normal] empowers 
[normal]different transport u
[normal]sers
[normal], and particularly disabled p
[normal]eople,
[normal] 
[normal]to engage 
[normal]in the decision-making 
[normal]process, creating better transport solutions for all sections of society.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal] 
[normal]L
[normal]ocal authorities, Passenger Transport Executive
[normal]s and Integrated Transport Authorities come directly within the remit of the Equality Act 2010,
[normal] through listing in Schedule 19. T
[normal]he status of
[normal] L
[normal]ocal 
[normal]T
[normal]ransport 
[normal]B
[normal]odie
[normal]s
[normal] and 
[normal]LEPs 
[normal]is far less clear. 
[normal]T
[normal]he
[normal]se bodies
[normal] 
[normal]carry
[normal] out public functions 
[normal]and so should be 
[normal]subject to the Act, 
[normal]but this 
[normal]has not been supported by clear guidance to this effect. It is concerning that the only easily 
[normal]accessible guidance 
[normal]is contained in the Supplementary Guidance to Local Enterprise Partnerships on the Development and Delivery of European Structural 
[normal]and Investment Funds 
[normal]Strategies. This document
[normal] reminds LEPs they need to “
[normal]familiarise themselves
[normal]”
[normal] with th
[normal]e Public Sector Equality Duty as they will be advising Managing Authorities (which are bound by these 
[normal]duties) on how best to exercise
[normal] public functions. 
[normal]This implies that LEPs do not themselves have to have regard to the Public Sector Equality Duty.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3
[normal] 
[normal]Th
[normal]ere are further concerns about accountability. In a recent article in Transport XTra, Professor Tony Travers of the London School of Economics
[normal] wrote,
[normal] “LEPs and local transport bodies are not local government. At the margin they are less legitimate than loc
[normal]al government, pure and simple”.   
[normal]Further concerns come from the recent National Audit Office report which stated: 
[normal]‘Locally, it is not clear that the government has achieved its objective to “increase democratic accountability and transparency, and ensu
[normal]re that public expenditure is more responsive to the need
[normal]s of local business and people” ’
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4
[normal] 
[normal]Furthermore, the report states 
[normal]‘
[normal]Local Enterprise Partnerships are not subject to the same transparency requirements as local authorities
[normal]’
[normal]. Not only is it unclear whether LEPs have to abide by the same equality requirements as local authorities but 
[normal]we are concerned that it will be more difficult for disability groups, such as Guide Dogs, to monitor the work of LEPs and hold them to account. 
[normal]Devolving responsibility for large amounts of transport funding to these bodies may 
[normal]result in less transparent and 
[normal]less accountable decision 
[normal]making, which will have a negative impact upon disabled people. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5
[normal] 
[normal]LEPs 
[normal]do 
[normal]incorporate a voluntary sector input,
[normal] 
[normal]but disability is much more than just a third sector issue and it would be wrong to assume that the third sector is necessarily the best way for people with disabilities to engage. 
[normal]In summary, 
[normal]with LEPs ta
[normal]king a greater role in decision 
[normal]making, 
[normal]we want to
[normal] see LEPs placed under a clear statutory duty to take equa
[normal]lities into account in decision 
[normal]making and to meet the same standards that apply to other public authorities in respect of consultation and engagement with people with a differing range of disabilit
[normal]ies, including 
[normal]visual impairment
[normal].
