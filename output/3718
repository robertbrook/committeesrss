defaultIntroductiondefaultWe wanted to see what the relationship was between a charity’s income and 
defaulttheir 
defaultCEO
default’s
default salary. This was to see if we could establish whether those organisations that paid their CEOs more
default, were the largest organisations in either total or voluntary income terms.
default We also wanted to find out whether there was any pattern either in organisationa
defaultl growth over the last five years or
default in
default CEO pay.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe took around 50 of the UK’s
default best-known charities accordi
defaultng to our
default awareness tracking and set
default our
default researchers to work on looking at their accounts
default. Here is what we found.
default&#xa0;
defaultSome summary factsdefault&#xa0;
defaultBetween 2007
default and 2012:
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe total income of our sample of 50
default charities
default has 
defaultincreased by 17.7%default default(or an average increase of 3.5% per year)

defaultStaff costs have 
defaultincreased by 24.2%default default(or an average of
default 4.85% per year)

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe salaries of their CEOs have
default 
defaultincreased by 18.0%default default(or an average of 3.6% per year)
default&#xa0;
defaultIn terms of changes in CEO pay, those charities that paid their CEOs below £100k in 2007 had increased their CEO salary by an average of 38% (or £32,000 
defaultin actual money) by 2012. Those who paid their CEOs above £100k in 2007 had increased their CEO salary by 6% (or £9000) by 2012.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe relationship between total income and CEO salarydefault&#xa0;
defaultChart 1 shows the relationship between CEO pay and total income for our 
defaultsample of 50 in 2012. The broad relationship is that the higher the total income, the higher the CEO salary, i.e.
default bigger charities pay their CEO
defaults more. 
default&#xa0;
defaultA statistical analysis on this relationship 
defaultshows 
defaulta high correlation of 0.67 between total income and 
defaultCEO pay (where the maximum possible correlation is 1, and the minimum is zero when two factors are completely unrelated).
default The correlation in
default 
defaultCEO pay with total income has 95% confidence limits of 0.47 to 0.80 (so fairly broad confidence intervals). See the
default table 
defaultbelow for more detail.
default&#xa0;
defaultEven just glancing at
default the data reveals that total income appears to be a key variable, but that some charities of a similar size do pay their CEOs very different amounts.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe relationship between voluntarydefault incomedefault, staffdefault costs and CEO salarydefaultAs well as total in
defaultcome, we also looked at staff costs
default and voluntary income as other determinants of CEO pay. Th
defaulte statistical analysis is below:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultR
defaultLower limit
defaultUpper limit
defaultTotal staff costs
default0.68
default0.49
default0.81
defaultVoluntary income
default0.55
default0.32
default0.72
defaultTotal income
default0.67
default0.47
default0.80
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultSo, while total income
default 
defaulthas a correlation of 0.67 o
defaultf CEO pay, t
defaultotal staff costs has a correlation of 0.68
default with CEO
default pay and voluntary income 
defaulta correlation of 0.55
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt should be pointed out that these factors are of course interrelated. The bigger the charity in income terms, the more staff it is likely to have and the more those staff are 
defaultlikely to cost. The reason voluntary income has the lowest correlation with CEO
default pay is that for, some of the charities on the list, it may only be a small portion of total income. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAnyway, for those interested in voluntary income and CEO pay, chart 2 shows the relationship (with one charity removed which distorted the scales)
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultHodefaultw have income and salaries increased over the last 5 yearsdefault&#xa0;defaultIf the previous set of data looked at absolute levels of CEO pay, this section looks at how they have changed over the last 5 years (2007 to 2012). 
default&#xa0;
defaultChart 3 shows the percentage increase in CEO p
defaultay versus the percentage increase in total income. Unlike chart 1, where the relationship was visible just by looking at the data, the relationship in chart 3 is much less clear. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOverall, the total income of the charities in the sample has grown by 17.7%
default and salaries of the CEOs have grown by 18%. In other words, CEO pay has grown very closely in line with total income.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs the pull-outs show, there are organisations who have grown substantially and whose CEO pay has hardly changed at all, while there are
default organisations wh
defaultich have hardly grown at all but
default their CEO pay has increased substantially. 
default&#xa0;
defaultChart 4 looks at the data in a different way and shows how the CEO pay has changed for each organisation in our sample. This reveals something very interesting
default; a £100k salary is a key issue for many boards and when they pay a CEO more than £100k
default for the first time
default, they have tended to exceed it by a fair margin in the period 2007-2012.
default&#xa0;
defaultSpeci
defaultfically, those organisations that
default paid their CEO less than £100k in 20
default07 increased their CEO salary by an average of 38% by 2012 (or a financial increase of £32,000). Those that paid their CEOs more than £100k in 2007 had a much lower increase overall - just 6%
default on average
default (or £9000). Indeed, a number of the charities with th
defaulte highest paid CEOs in 2007
default had
default 
defaultreduceddefault that salary by 2012. So what appears to be happenin
defaultg is a rebalancing of CEO salaries
default based on market forces. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMany of those who have paid their CEOs under £100k in 2007 decided by 2012 that they needed to pay them more, in some cases substantially so. At the top end of the scale, a number decided that they needed to reduce their CEO pay. We have not done an analys
defaultis to see what the impact of a change of CEO appears to have on these 
defaultfigures, though we do know that a number of CEO changed in our sample in the period in question
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultConclusiondefaultWe draw four conclusions:
default&#xa0;
defaultMethodologydefaultThe sample of the 50
defaultish
default charities includes those with the highest levels of spontaneous awareness in our Charity
default Awareness Monitor (CAM). All the UK’s best known charities were therefore in this sample. The reason to take this sample was in order to examine those charities which are in the scrutiny of the public eye, not those who are technically charities but recei
defaultve most of their fund
defaulting
default from statutory sources or earned income.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe used the formal accounts lodged with the Charity Commission to find out the key data for our research (it is often not possible to find even the most recent accounts on a charity’s websi
defaultte, let alone the last five years). Using this data, we created a vast spreadsheet of these results. As well as CEO pay, we documented all the numbers of people in the different pay bands. As the actual pay is unknown, we assumed that the actual salary was
default in the middle of a pay band (so if an employee was in the band £120k - £130k we gave them a salary of £125k). We also assumed that the highest paid employee was the CEO. We know of at least one charity where this is not the case. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe decided not to name 
defaultany individual charity in the analysis in order to focus on the big picture changes, rather than what any one charity has done. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are happy to share the list of charities in the sample with those who are interested. There is also a more complete set of charts and the complete statistical analysis for those who like that kind of thing.
