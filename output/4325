[normal]Summary
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]General
[normal]1. UK drivers are 
[normal]much more
[normal] considerate of cyclists
[normal] 
[normal]than are their counterparts in 
[normal]Canberra or Sydney
[normal]. 
[normal]My observations suggest that where
[normal] 
[normal]problems
[normal] 
[normal]exist 
[normal]they stem from inappropr
[normal]iate infrastructure
[normal] not driver
[normal] or rider
[normal] attitu
[normal]d
[normal]es
[normal].

[normal]Cycling 
[normal]Out of town
[normal]2. The basic road network
[normal] of the UK
[normal] is set up for motor vehicles only. This 
[normal]may
[normal] be because 20th century road engineers did not 
[normal]consider
[normal] bicycles a legitimate form of transport
[normal] and did not 
[normal]take
[normal] them 
[normal]into account 
[normal]when designing the roads
[normal]. Whatever the reason, the challenge now is to retro-fit the network to accommodate not only 
[normal]conventional 
[normal]bicycles but other emerging 
[normal]light vehicle technologies
[normal], of which there are several
[normal], l
[normal]ong-t
[normal]erm d
[normal]ependence on cars 
[normal]being
[normal] unsustainable.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. Motorways and trunk A-roads are ideally placed for long-distance 
[normal]light vehicle
[normal] travel but are not open to
[normal] 
[normal]or are incompatible with cycling. This is unfortunate as even your longest inter-city distances are qu
[normal]ite short. 
[normal]London to Bristol, for example, could take a day
[normal] by pedal cycle
[normal]. 
[normal]W
[normal]ith the existing 
[normal]infrastructure
[normal] it takes three days. The road reserves for M- and trunk- 
[normal]road
[normal]s
[normal] are plenty wide enough to 
[normal]accommo
[normal]date a cycle path
[normal] on one side
[normal], yet very few
[normal] such ro
[normal]ads
[normal] 
[normal]do.
[normal] I hear the original Severn Crossing is nearing the end of its life
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]y
[normal]et the Second Severn Crossing makes no provision
[normal] at all
[normal] for cycles or light vehicles. If the 
[normal]M48
[normal] Severn Bridge were to close the cycling distance from 
[normal]London
[normal] to Cardiff would 
[normal]be increased by 
[normal]a day
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. 
[normal]Most
[normal] 
[normal]A-roads
[normal] 
[normal]between
[normal] towns
[normal], especially those with one
[normal]-
[normal] and two
[normal]-
[normal]digit road numbers,
[normal] 
[normal]are too dangerous for cycling. Many 
[normal]run
[normal] in narrow road corridors with scarcely room for two lanes of motor traffic. Retro-fitting 
[normal]these 
[normal]would 
[normal]involve widening the corridor
[normal] or at least flattening and paving the verge
[normal]. Whether that 
[normal]would be
[normal] 
[normal]an 
[normal]appropriate
[normal] thing to do
[normal] should depend on local factors
[normal], for example
[normal], on
[normal] whether there is a nearby
[normal] alternative 
[normal]ro
[normal]ute
[normal] that bicycles could use
[normal]. 
[normal]Not all roads need 
[normal]to 
[normal]be 
[normal]made 
[normal]cyclable
[normal], just as not all laneways need be wide enough for HGVs. 
[normal]Various significant tourist sites, for example Stonehenge, 
[normal]Silbury
[normal] Hill and the Kennett Long Barrow, cannot 
[normal]at present
[normal] 
[normal]be accessed safely by 
[normal]bi
[normal]cycle, yet minor m
[normal]odificati
[normal]ons to short sections of A-road
[normal] 
[normal]are all that 
[normal]is
[normal] needed
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. 
[normal]Most B-roads out of town are safe for cycling
[normal], chiefly
[normal] bec
[normal]ause the traffic is lighter
[normal]. 
[normal](
[normal]Exceptions 
[normal]occur. For example the B4455 Fosse Way through Warwickshire is as dangerous as 
[normal]m
[normal]any A-ro
[normal]ad
[normal]s
[normal].
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]However, so
[normal] few people ride between towns that motorists 
[normal]do not expect to come
[normal] across a cyclist. 
[normal]The safety of 
[normal]B-roads and ‘minor’ A-roads would 
[normal]improve if
[normal] more cyclists 
[normal]used
[normal] them.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6. 
[normal]Many 
[normal]towns
[normal] are linked not only by an A- or B-road but also by unc
[normal]lassified roads. 
[normal]Such
[normal] roads
[normal] 
[normal]tend to be narrow 
[normal]and 
[normal]are 
[normal]slow enough for motor vehicles and bicycles to co-exist 
[normal]safely
[normal].
[normal] These indirect 
[normal]routes are 
[normal]readily 
[normal]cyclable
[normal] 
[normal]and pleasant
[normal] to ride on. 
[normal]I
[normal]n hilly country
[normal], however, there 
[normal]may be 
[normal]only one road
[normal] between two 
[normal]towns
[normal], and if 
[normal]that
[normal] 
[normal]happens to be
[normal] a
[normal] 
[normal]‘
[normal]fast
[normal]’
[normal] A-road
[normal] there is no safe cycle route
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7
[normal]. 
[normal]UK 
[normal]I
[normal]nte
[normal]r-town distances are very short and
[normal] well within the 
[normal]capabilities of any cyclist. There ought to be much more local
[normal]-
[normal]area cycling than I 
[normal]observed
[normal]. Without
[normal] some 
[normal]inter-t
[normal]own cycling infrastructure, 
[normal]however
[normal], this is not going to happen. 
[normal]There are many 
[normal]places where 
[normal]simple, cheap and effective inter-town cycling infrastructure
[normal] 
[normal]could be installed
[normal]. 
[normal]The design has to suit cycling, 
[normal]though
[normal], and not be tokenistic. On-road lanes are
[normal] far more useful than off-road constructions that twist and turn, start and stop, go up kerbs, have walk-only sections, and so on (see 1
[normal]4
[normal]).
[normal] 
[normal]Some rural sections of main road have a pedestrian path alongside, although it is often neglected and overgrown. Suc
[normal]h paths if cleared and maintained could be easily 
[normal]adapted
[normal] to pedestrian plus cycle use.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8
[normal]. Linked-up-
[normal]ness
[normal] is extremely important to 
[normal]the 
[normal]safety
[normal] of 
[normal]a
[normal] cycle network
[normal]. 
[normal]A single 
[normal]im
[normal]-passable junction or a hundred yards of un-
[normal]cyclable
[normal] road can destroy an otherwis
[normal]e useable route.  
[normal]I 
[normal]came across
[normal] 
[normal]examples
[normal] where 
[normal]one
[normal] council has 
[normal]made
[normal] 
[normal]a bike 
[normal]lane
[normal] up to its boundary but the adjoining council hasn’t. 
[normal]This sort of thing
[normal] leaves 
[normal]the
[normal] inter-town cyclist high and dry.
[normal] 
[normal]Linked-up-
[normal]ness
[normal] needs co-operation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9
[normal]. 
[normal]I
[normal]nformation
[normal] about 
[normal]cyclable
[normal] 
[normal]out-of-town 
[normal]routes
[normal] is 
[normal]hard to come by
[normal]. An assumption seems to be that 
[normal]all 
[normal]cyclists live locally and know 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]local 
[normal]routes. In
[normal] particular, 
[normal]there is lack of 
[normal]in
[normal]formation 
[normal]about
[normal] which A- and B-
[normal]roads
[normal] are 
[normal]cyclable
[normal] 
[normal]and which 
[normal]are not
[normal].
[normal] Cycling charit
[normal]ies such as SUSTRANS 
[normal]are designing a network of 
[normal]recommend
[normal]ed
[normal] r
[normal]outes
[normal] but 
[normal]they tend to pick the most scenic
[normal] and meandering of 
[normal]the
[normal] alternatives
[normal]. The
[normal]ir
[normal] routes
[normal] cover 
[normal]only 
[normal]a tiny fraction of what is 
[normal]cyclable
[normal] while their 
[normal]maps 
[normal]focus
[normal] 
[normal]chiefly 
[normal]on their preferred route
[normal]s. Some money put into 
[normal]a 
[normal]map
[normal] of
[normal] 
[normal]cyclable
[normal] through routes
[normal],
[normal] including routes on the A- and B- network
[normal],
[normal] would be of great benefit to the touring cyclist. 
[normal]Such 
[normal]a 
[normal]map
[normal] could also 
[normal]help identify
[normal] where short, cheap, simple improvements 
[normal]c
[normal]ould join the dots and make i
[normal]nter-town 
[normal]and long distance 
[normal]cycling more accessible 
[normal]for
[normal] all.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In-town cycling
[normal]10. 
[normal]Roads i
[normal]n 
[normal]provincial
[normal] towns, whether nominally A-, B- or unclassified, are generally 
[normal]cyclable
[normal]. Traffic is slow, obstacles such as parked cars, turning vehicles, pedestrians
[normal], 
[normal]traffic lights, pedestrian crossings and speed bumps keep things that way, and motor traffic and bicycles can very easily co-exist.
[normal] Motorists need to be aware that cycles have to go around drains and that sort of thing. Cyclists need to be aware that holdi
[normal]ng up a car for a few extra seconds can be very frustrating for the motorist.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11. Cities have an extra class of road, the cross-city through route
[normal]. It is
[normal] the urban equivalent of a trunk road
[normal]. These
[normal] 
[normal]roads 
[normal]are highly dangerous
[normal]. 
[normal]I would not cycle on them. 
[normal]Th
[normal]e problem, as usual, is they were planned and constructed without thought to 
[normal]bicycles
[normal] as a means of transport and they make no concessions to the needs of cyclists. Some cities have attempted to retro-fit cycle lanes but these often stop when the going get
[normal]s tough, for example at junctions or whe
[normal]re
[normal] the carriageway is narrow, so 
[normal]they 
[normal]merely pay a token nod to cycling. 
[normal]Bad retro-fits like that do not decrease the danger. 
[normal]The road corridor, though, is often wide enough that a proper cycle route could be fitted,
[normal] and if this were done such a route
[normal], whether on-road or not,
[normal] would be safe.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12. Road junctions are one of the least friendly aspects of cycling in towns and cities. Very many junctions have been designed without any thought to how a cyclist might negotiat
[normal]e them. Some of the bigger roundabouts simply cannot be negotiated. 
[normal]Having o
[normal]ne of those in a route negates the entire route. There is usually room 
[normal]to cater 
[normal]for 
[normal]bicycles (and other light vehicles)
[normal] if the road engineers had 
[normal]considered
[normal] them.
[normal] Where the enginee
[normal]ring has gone out of its way to make life difficult for the bike rider there 
[normal]are bound to be 
[normal]problem
[normal]s
[normal] but I’ve yet to see a junction where a bike compatible design could not be implemented.
[normal] That said, a minimally bike compatible design is not the same as a
[normal] fair
[normal]-
[normal]for
[normal]-
[normal]all design. I 
[normal]came across
[normal] one junction 
[normal]where 
[normal]the
[normal] cyclist 
[normal]i
[normal]s expected to push seven 
[normal]crossing buttons and wait seven times (14 minutes?) to go straight on. It’s no wonder 
[normal]some cyclists
[normal] 
[normal]take their chance on
[normal] the road.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13. Cities and larger towns som
[normal]etimes 
[normal]have
[normal] mixed cycling and bus lanes. These are less than ideal 
[normal]from the safety angle 
[normal]since bicycles and bu
[normal]ses are of very different sizes and have very different driv
[normal]ing characteristics: bu
[normal]ses accelerate well and cruise at 30mph but keep stopping, bicy
[normal]cles accelerate
[normal] poorly and 
[normal]cruise at 10-15mph
[normal];
[normal] so the two kinds of vehicle in the same lane get in each other’s way. The
[normal]se mixed lanes
[normal] are not so much 
[normal]inherently 
[normal]unsafe as frustrating and annoying
[normal], but frustration and annoyance breed danger
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14. Most 
[normal]town and city 
[normal]off-road cycle lanes and joint pedestrian/cycle lanes are of limited use to cyclists
[normal] as currently configured
[normal]. They stop and start in unexpected ways. They are very poorly signed – only a local would kno
[normal]w where they go. The beginnings
[normal] 
[normal]invariab
[normal]ly 
[normal]are 
[normal]unmarked
[normal] for the approaching on-road cyclist
[normal] and
[normal] 
[normal]are 
[normal]very easily missed
[normal], even impossible, sometimes, to turn into
[normal]. The
[normal]se off-road paths
[normal] typically
[normal] involve ste
[normal]ep grades and rough surfaces
[normal] while t
[normal]he cyclist must
[normal] 
[normal]stop
[normal] to negotiat
[normal]e
[normal] driveways, road crossi
[normal]ngs, kerbs and the like
[normal] and quite often is expected to get off and walk at junctions or bus stops. The
[normal]y
[normal] are not a serious cycling 
[normal]transport 
[normal]alternative, except they can be a 
[normal]safe 
[normal]‘pavement cycling’ alternative 
[normal]near
[normal] schools. Motorists 
[normal]often 
[normal]get annoyed when
[normal] 
[normal]a cyclist
[normal] use
[normal]s
[normal] the road instead of an adjacent off-road path, but there is usually 
[normal]a 
[normal]good reason why they do.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]T
[normal]ime-sharing with HGVs
[normal]15. 
[normal]I have 
[normal]seen
[normal] the suggestion that certain routes in London should be time-shared. This might make cycling safer at n
[normal]on-
[normal]HGV times but would not 
[normal]make 
[normal]it
[normal] safer at 
[normal]other 
[normal]times when the road 
[normal]i
[normal]s still shared
[normal] and might make it less safe if HGV and other drivers assume there will be no bicycles on the road outside of 
[normal]the 
[normal]‘no-HGV’ times
[normal]. These roads will be of the urban 
[normal]through-route class
[normal] (my 
[normal]para
[normal] 11)
[normal],
[normal] equivalent in danger to an A-trunk road
[normal]. 
[normal]Time-sharing ought only to be considered a stopgap solution to what is in essence a local, 
[normal]al
[normal]though still a very serious, problem. 
[normal]A
[normal]ny
[normal] permanent solution 
[normal]ought to
[normal] involve reconfigur
[normal]ing the
[normal] road
[normal], 
[normal]perhaps 
[normal]along 
[normal]with nearby parallel roads
[normal], to be bicycle
[normal]/light vehicle
[normal] compatible
[normal].
