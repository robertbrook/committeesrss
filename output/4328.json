"&#xa0;\nWritten Evidence submitted by Food Security Ltd&#xa0;We are a group of concerned farmers who want to alert Government and the public to the rapid decline in the amount of food produced in this country, and to the fact that defence and national security are inextricably linked with home food production.We are not anti-government, neither are we commercially or politically motivated. We are particularly concerned about how 62m people will be fed in the event of a crisis, and what can actually be done to improve this critical situation.&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nExecutive SummaryFor several years we have voiced our concern about the UK food trade deficit. Has the Treasury noticed this \never-incre\nasing gap – now £19.5\nbn, up £5bn since 5 years ago? Should this fact not be a potent warning and a wake-up call?\nOu\nr\n reliance on sea traffic is becoming gradually greater; however, no-one can deny the weakening of the Royal Navy. We also rely on \ncertain geo-political factors that do not change – trade, distance, and\n choke points that the UK depends on. \nThere is a large range and shifting complex of risks and threats to our national security, but one thing is clear, that to increase UK food product\nion is essential and vital to our future safety as well as to our social and economic well-being.\n David Heath’s article in the national press ‘Dig for Survival’ was starkly relevant in our present position.\nOur thoughts are tersely summed up in the words o\nf George Washington: ‘I know of no pursuit in which more real and important services can be rendered to any country than by improving its agriculture’.\nDecember 2013 \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
