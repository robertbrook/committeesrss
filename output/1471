defaultThis evidence is submitted on behalf of Scienceogram UK, an organisation 
defaultaiming
default to raise awareness of the amount that the UK governm
defaultent spends on scientific research, and highlight the disparity between this and the size of the problems that science is trying to solve.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOne technique employed is to divide up spending on science and technology into pounds per person per year—and this sim
defaultple methodology yields some surprising results. For example, cancer kills around 30% of people, and yet we spend just £4.30 per person per year on pu
defaultblic-funded cancer research. Furthermore,
default cancer is by far the best-funded medical condition—stroke is resp
defaultonsible for 10% of deaths, and yet just 28p per person per year is spent on research. More information is available on the Scienceogram website

defaultWe are strong proponents of open data. Most of the data used on 
defaultscienceogram.org
default has been obtained from publicly available sources, with supplementary data obtained from gover
defaultnment sources. All of 
defaultour result
defaults
default,
default together with calculations
default,
default are available online.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultScientific research and innovation are vital to the UK economy, our health and our lifestyles. We believe that putting science and technology funding into context, through the use of per capit
defaulta figures and other such techniques, would be useful when making science funding policy decisions, and additionally makes an extremely important but potentially arcane topic more accessible. We would 
defaultlike to see wider participation in the debate surroundin
defaultg science funding both within politics and the public, and hope that the insights we have gained in developing the Scienceogram can be of use to the Committee in commissioning reports or inquiries to that end.
default5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe have divided our submission into three sect
defaultions:
default6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe NAO’s recent report
default draws together a range of pre-existing data on public and private inputs to UK R&amp;D, and provides a useful official compilation of 
defaultthis information. However, we would argue that the kinds of data presented—past inputs and international comparisons—are not the most useful context in which to consider R&amp;D spending.
default7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFor instance, whilst the data presented do make it clear that the UK cou
defaultld invest more when compared to many other economically successful countries, international comparisons are an unsophisticated tool for determining what a country should spend on science. Desired and expected outputs—rather than others’ inputs—should infor
defaultm levels of spending.
default8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAdditionally, the NAO report does not fully reflect recent changes in UK science funding. This is understandable, given that the SET Statistics
default 
defaultand OECD data
default 
defaultfrom which it is drawn are necessarily post-hoc audits of spending across 
defaulta large number of institutions. For example, the SET Statistics are, at the time of writing, only available until financial year 2010–11; this limits analysis of recent budget decisions. It would be helpful for policymakers, journalists and citizens to hav
defaulte access to an official source of more up-to-date figures, even if they are provisional
default,
default or based on budgets rather than expenditure.
default9
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMore fundamentally, the NAO report in its present form seems unlikely to engage a broad constituency of policymakers and t
defaulthe public. We believe that improved data collection and more accessible presentation could raise the profile of research in politics and allow a wider debate about R&amp;D funding and policy.
default10
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe have a number of specif
defaultic recommendations which
default could be suitable
default for a follow-up report or committee inquiry, presented in the third section of this submission, starting at paragraph 
default20
default.
default11
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is very likely that the net effect of the 2010 and 2013 Spending Review decisions constitutes a substantial real-terms cut in science funding over the term of this parliament.
default12
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs mentioned above, the most recent SET Statistics are those from FY2010–11, meaning that only one year of public R&amp;D funding numbers is available 
defaultsince 
defaultCSR2010. According to these numbers, total public spending on science fell from £10.7bn in 2009–10 to £
default10.0bn in 2010–11; a 7% cut, and the largest real-terms drop in per capita research spending since the SET data began in 1986
default.
default13
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is difficult to ascertain what exactly has happened to public funding of R&amp;
defaultD since then, but there are strong indications that the trajectory is downwards. The two major sources of R&amp;D funding within government are the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), which disburses resource and capital funding directly to u
defaultniversities and research councils, and individual departments’ R&amp;D budgets. 
default14
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe are currently in correspondence with BIS and, though we have yet to complete our analysis, we understand from the figures provided that the annual budget from 2011–15 has been 
defaultcut in real terms compared to the 2010–11 baseline.
default15
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFigures obtained by the Campaign for Science and Engineering (CaSE) suggest that other departments have been reducing the proportion of research within their budgets, which are themselves being cut.
default16
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA r
defaultecent report by grassroots campaigning organisation Science is Vital
default attempted to gauge the impacts of these cuts on the ground. An online survey of nearly 900 working and former scientists found that 85% were worried about funding, and 68% were concerned
default about their employment (a figure which rises to 90% if you exclude principal investigators, many of whom have permanent positions). Over half of respondents reported reduced success in grant applications since 2010.
default17
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are also broader policy implicati
defaultons from the way spending has been allocated. Over a third of capital spending on science between 2010 and 2015 was announced in a number of windfalls by the Chancellor. Disbursing funding through these unpredictable ‘fiscal events’ leads to uncertainty ab
defaultout science spending in the long term, making planning difficult at all levels, from individual research scientists considering their own careers to multinational companies considering investments in the UK.
default18
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFurther, the windfalls have largely been earmark
defaulted for a range of specified projects, from green computing to graphene. Where to direct research money has typically been the domain of practising scientists via peer-review panels; instead, these decisions about the allocation of science funding were made
default at high levels within government. Strategic direction of funding by central government is not in itself a bad thing; however, this change has seemingly occurred without the opportunity for consultation or debate.
default19
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn summary, the 2010 and 2013 Spending Rev
defaultiews have had significant financial and po
defaultlicy repercussions for science.
default20
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultScience and technology have widespread impacts on everyday life, and their funding should be an issue with broader political recognition a
defaultmong both policymakers and the public. Comprehensive and 
defaultcomprehensible statistics are vital to inform future science funding decisions, and to facilitate wider engagement with this important issue.
default 
default21
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe suggest that further collation of data is needed for 
defaultmeaningful and accessible analysis of R&amp;D spending, extending the NAO report to include a more detailed breakdown of funding and additional context so that this disaggregated data can be understood. This would require:
default22
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCurrently available science and technology spending data are usually divided up either according to internal governmental budgetary divisions (for example by research council or department), or by tradition
defaultal subject area (such as physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, maths, social science, etc). Whilst these do have some policy relevance, they are not as important as the ultimate aims of research activities, and do not allow spending to be put into cont
defaultext. (For example, there is no obvious imperative for a certain specific level of investment in the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BBSRC], or the subject of physics, considered in the abstract.)
default23
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe recommend collecting data on R&amp;D 
defaultspending in cross-departmental, interdisciplinary thematic areas based on socioeconomic goals. These goals could include health, energy, food, and so on. Such categorisation is arguably the best lens through which to view science and technology funding fro
defaultm both a public interest and a policy perspective. Further granularity within these socioeconomic goals (e.g. specific diseases within the health research portfolio) would be very useful for more detailed comparisons.
default24
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is, of course, important not to neg
defaultlect research which does not have an immediate and predictable application. Public-funded ‘basic’ or ‘blue-skies’ research has resulted in many extremely significant discoveries, from lasers to the internet, whose full importance would have been impossible
default for contemporary technologists to have understood. Therefore, focusing on research with a defined socioeconomic impact at the expense of more general investigation could be deleterious for scientific progress. It would nonetheless be valuable to collect t
defaulthese data on basic research funding alongside more applied science.
default25
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe SET Statistics do make some attempt to divide spending into themes, but there are large uncertainties resulting from the underlying methodology. Indeed, according to BIS, ‘these calcul
defaultations are not very meaningful’
default because the survey asks respondents to report how much of their expenditure ‘relates’ to specified categories, without requiring a thorough or consistent audit of spending. Additionally, ‘general advancement of knowledge’ a
defaultccounts for nearly half of spending, but is not broken down further.
default26
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSome further information on the component of general advancement of knowledge funded by universities is available through, for example, the Higher Education Funding Council for England 
default(H
defaultEFCE) breakdown of mainstream quality-related funding.
default This is categorised by academic subject
defaults
default (known as ‘units of assessment’). However, research into a particular subject could touch on one or many socioeconomic objectives, and further uncertainty is i
defaultntroduced because these block grants need not be spent on the area for which they are allocated.
default27
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSimilar ambiguity exists in departmental R&amp;D spending data due to the diversity of funding sources. For example, medical research is funded through research c
defaultouncils such as BBSRC and MRC via BIS; the Department of Health; and money allocated to universities via the Higher Education Funding Councils. Aggregating these figures is not, as far as we know, currently possible.
default28
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe believe creating a single authoritat
defaultive source of well-curated data broken down by socioeconomic goal would be a worthwhile priority for the Committee.
defaultThe socio-economic scale of science funding
default29
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe context most relevant to science funding is the scale of thes
defaulte socioeconomic goals. We therefore recommend that the Committee collect data to quantify the magnitude of these challenges. 
default30
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe best way to set this context will vary by category of research, and there may be multiple perspectives from which to view each one. For example, in the case of health, the Scienceogram compares spending on disease research to the fraction of deaths cau
defaultsed by those diseases, as well as their total economic cost (as mentioned in the 
defaultIntroduction
default—additional detail is available in the 
defaultAppendix
default).
default31
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFor energy research, the simples
defaultt comparison is purely economic. The Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) reports that we spend around £2200 per capita on energy.
default Energy prices are also increasing rapidly: the UK per capita spend on energy increased by 60% 
defaultin real terms 
defaultbetwe
defaulten 2001 and 2011. The combined spend by 
defaultUK 
defaultresearch co
defaultuncils and the EU on
default energy research amounts to just over £5 per person per year—less than 0.25% of 
defaultthe current
default total.
default32
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are many different ways to make these comparisons; for example, energy 
defaultresearch should also be considered in the context of the effects that energy generation has on the climate. The choice of comparators inevitably has a subjective and political component, and judicious use of multiple comparisons allows conclusions to be ro
defaultbust and politically neutral.
default33
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe recommend that the Committee consider appropriate comparators to a variety of categories of science spending and collate those figures alongside a thematic summary of science spending.
defaultEstimating the cost of scientific obje
defaultctives
default34
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAnother perspective which can be used to put science funding into context is the historical and projected costs of achieving specific scientific goals. There is a widespread misconception that research objectives, such as medical treatments or
default new e
defaultnergy technologies, can
default be considered to be a certain number of years away. However, it is common for resource constraints to be a bottleneck in 
defaultscience (for example, experiments could often be run in parallel if sufficient resources were available); it is
default therefore more instructive to imagine that scientific goals are a certain number of person-hours, or an investment, away from fruition.
default35
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFor example, a 2002 German government analysis estimated that developing nuclear fusion to the point of viable electric
defaultity generation would cost between €60 and €80 billion.
default Whilst such estimates are inherently uncertain, this figure is comparable to the cost of large public infrastructure projects, but with transformative implications for global energy production.
default36
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe re
defaultsources and skills upon which the Select Committee can draw could allow similar estimates on a variety of socioeconomic and scientific goals from across UK R&amp;D to be developed in consultation with experts.
default37
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOfficial data on research funding group
defaulted by socioeconomic objective should be collected. Assessment of R&amp;D funding should then take place within a context set by the scale of socioeconomic and scientific challenges being addressed. This framework would allow policymakers and the public to part
defaultake in more informed debate and decisions around public funding of research. 
defaultThe government should make these statistics publicly available, and integrate them into R&amp;D funding targets.

defaultCancer kills nearly a third of us, and yet public spending on cancer research is less than £5 per person per year. And it’s argua
defaultbly the best-funded medical condition—looking at other big killers paints a stark picture of the state of UK medical research funding.
default40
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHeart disease is responsible for around 15% of deaths, and yet we spend just £1.30 per person per year researching it. St
defaultroke is the third most deadly individual condition, responsible for 10% of deaths; stroke research receives just 28 pence per person per year. So, astonishingly, these three conditions are responsible for over half of the deaths in the UK, and yet we inves
defaultt less than £6 per person per year to try to understand their causes and find new treatments.
default41
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLooking at mortality statistics starts to give a sense of scale to measure up health research spending, but what doesn’t kill you can nonetheless have a huge effe
defaultct on your quality of life. It would be a mistake to concentrate our research solely on the most fatal conditions. For example, dementia has a 
defaultmassive effect on quality of life, but the condition itself is rarely fatal. It affects one in six people over 80
default; we spend about 60p per person per year researching it.
default42
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe suffering caused by illness should be reason enough to invest more seriously in looking for treatments. However, diseases also come with a significant economic cost. Firstly, there’s the substant
defaultial direct cost, in terms of health and social care for sufferers. Secondly, there are large indirect costs, such as friends and family members taking time off work to care for loved ones. The total economic impact of the four diseases mention
defaulted is over £8
default00 per UK citizen
default per year. This makes the combined £6.50 we each spend researching all four of these conditions look rather paltry.
