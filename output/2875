default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUNISON is the UK’s largest public services union representing over 
default1.1 million workers in local government, health, education, police and justice and the voluntary and community sector delivering public services. UNISON members work directly for contracting public authorities and for 
defaultprivate, community and voluntary sector service providers.

defaultUNISON believes that more regulation in procurement and strengthening accountability 
defaultis paramount before the government opens public services further. We have set out our reasons and evidence and recommendations in Appendix 1.

defaultTransparencydefault, defaultCouncil governance, scrutiny and democratic accountabilitydefault&#xa0;
default5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe introduction of Elected Mayors, Cabinet and Leader models and the delegation of decision making now also mean that these decisions are often made by a single councillor or a small handful of councillors
default and cabinets
default.
default&#xa0;
default6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOften, the scrutiny function is either too weak, too under resourced,
default undermined by cabinet pressure
default or provided with insufficient information to adequately ensure that these major procurement decisions are properly examined. 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultWeakness of external auditdefault&#xa0;
default7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUNISON is concerned that external audit of council procurement decisions and expenditure is weak and that there is an absence of effective mechanisms to review external audit inadequacies. 
default&#xa0;default8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Audit Commission is being disbanded and external audit for councils in England now rests in the hands of ‘self-regulating’ accountancy firms – many of the same firms which have been 
defaultcriticised
default by the Public Accounts Committee for their activities in helping corporate clients dodge taxes
default.
default&#xa0;defaultValue for money - Major contract failure and procurement models that create additional riskdefault&#xa0;
default9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRecent trends in public sector procurement place reliance on bidders to work out the detail of service design and delivery and calculate the costs – variously referred to as ‘outcomes-based commissioning’, ‘enabling’, ‘thin client’, ‘intelligent client’ and ‘light client’.  Andy 
defaultMudd
default from the Association of Public Service Excellence (APSE) has highlighted how the risks and complexity of working out the necessary ‘inputs’ are increasingly being left to the bidders.
default  
default&#xa0;
default10.
default 
defaultRecent examples West Coast Main Line (Department for Transport), G4S (LOCOG) and allegations of fraud by the Ministry of Justice against SERCO and G4S cast serious doubt on the likelihood that this form of commissioning can deliver best value or transfer risk. 
default&#xa0;
defaultPower imbalancedefault&#xa0;
default11.
default 
default 
defaultUNISON is concerned about the number of instances where the balance of power within complex arrangements is inappropriately weighted towards the private sector and against the public interest. 
defaultThis is largely due to the 
defaultloss of in-house capacity, the development of ‘company towns’ (where the local economy becomes excessively reliant on the contractor’s presence), and the threat of legal action by contractors
default. 
defaultSee example of Liverpool and Southwest One examples in Appendix 1
default. 
defaultValue for money through indefault – defaultsourcingdefault default&#xa0;default12.
default 
defaultThe 
defaultincreases in contract failings have
default led a growing number of local authorities to take the decision to bring privatised services back in-house.
default&#xa0;
default13.
default 
defaultA study
default for UNISON carried out by APSE found that o
defaultut of 140 survey respondents, 57% had either brought a service back in-house, were in the
default 
defaultprocess of 
defaultinsourcing
default or were considering doing so. A need to improve efficiency and reduce service costs was the most frequent key reason for 
defaultinsourcing
default with almost 60% of respondents citing it. After cost, 44% of respondents said a need to improve service quality was critical to the decision to 
defaultinsource
default. The research found that councils of all sizes, locations and political complexions were represented among those deciding to 
defaultinsource
default. 
defaultInsourcing
default was regarded as a means of delivering efficiency savings in the face of mounting budgetary pressure. 
defaultCut-price procurement and the effect on quality: the damage in social care default&#xa0;
default14.
default 
defaultIt is clear that in some areas of local authority expenditure the twin pressures of rising demand for services and funding cuts have created a drive by councils to secure cost-cutting at the expense of service quality. Nowhere is this more prominent than in social care. UNISON has been at the forefront of campaigning to highlight the 
defaultalarming decline in the quality of care that users receive.
default&#xa0;
default15.
default 
defaultUNISON research based on 
defaultFoI
default data from councils in England, Wales and Scotland found that 81% of councils commission from homecare providers where they do not guarantee providers specific hours from one week to the next. This enables councils to drive down the costs they incur as a result of fluctuations in care need. But it fuels the use of zero hours contracts for homecare workers. As the Minister for Care Norman Lamb has stated: 
default“
defaultThe idea of a zero hours contract is in most circumstances completely incompatible with a model of high quality care in which the individual really gets to know their care worker
default.”
default&#xa0;
default16.
default 
defaultThe consequences of this cut-price approach by councils in the homecare sector were encapsulated in the recent Government-commissioned Cavendish Review which stated that:
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultIt will not be possible to build a sustainable, caring, integrated health and social care system on the backs of domiciliary care workers who have to travel long distances on zero hours contracts, to reach people who have to see multiple different faces each week... The advent of zero hours contracts, fee cuts and no payment for travel time is making it financially prohibitive for some domiciliary care workers to struggle on. Attrition rates are already dangerously high: and they will only increase when carers feel that they can no longer even give good care.”
default&#xa0;
default17.
default 
defaultA growing number of councils are recognising that the quality and reliability of privatised homecare has become unacceptable. 
defaultThese developments in homecare have led UNISON to establish our T
defaultime to Care 
defaultcampaign which asks councils to sign up to an ‘ethical care charter’ to commission homecare in line with a core set of baseline standards including non-use of 15-minute visits, ensuring payment of travel time, non-use of zero hours contracts and proper training and support for staff to raise concerns about care standards.
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultProcurement from the community and voluntary sectordefault&#xa0;default18.
default 
defaultUNISON represents more than 60,000 members working in the community and voluntary sector – a large proportion of whom work in services commissioned by local government.
default&#xa0;
default19.
default 
defaultUNISON is seeing a rise in consortia bidding for contracts instead of just individual charities. However, these are large and expensive exercises to engage in, and often a large private contractor will be the principle bidder while work flowing to the charities will be sub-contracted.
default&#xa0;
default This has led to the phenomenon of the profitable work being 
defaultcreamed off by the contractor and charities left to deliver  services at bargain basement prices, which are sometimes loss making.
default&#xa0;
default It also means charities having to squeeze down even further on the pay and terms and conditions of staff, and increasingly using zero-hour contracts
default.
default&#xa0;defaultUNISON recommendations on defaultlocal government defaultprocurementdefault&#xa0;default20.
default 
defaultTo address the current concerns around procurement practices UNISON has submitted a set of recommendations to the CLG select committee
default which we would also like the PASC to consider as part of this inquiry in to the governments public service reform programme. See section 2 in Appendix 
default&#xa0;
defaultUK transposition of the defaultEU Procurement Ddefaultirective and reserved contracts for defaultmutualsdefault21.
default 
defaultUNISON has concerns over some provisions in the forthcoming EU procurement directive 
defaultwhich we would like the committee to consider as part of the ongoing inquiry into open public services. These are set out in section 3 Appendix 1 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultQ2: Does opening up the public services to alternative providers improve customer choice, defaultdiversity in local defaultservices and accountability?default&#xa0;defaultNHSdefault&#xa0;default22.
default 
defaultUNISON remains concerned that the choice agenda has been too narrowly focused and too easily equates patients with consumers.
default&#xa0;
default23.
default 
defaultThere is a distinction to be made between real choice and the artificial creation of markets in the health service. When it comes to areas such as maternity or end of life, there is a real choice between different clinical or lifestyle approaches. In other areas, the move to an Any Qualified Provider system of service provision is more about creating a market with opportunities for new entrants from outside the NHS, with no evidence that this form of provider plurality increases the quality of care or patient experience, or that patients want it. 
default&#xa0;
default24.
default 
defaultDavid Boyle’s “Barriers to Choice Review” produced for the government is very instructive in this regards. He found that public support for choice of hospitals is ambiguous and that proximity to home remains the most important factor for patients when choosing which hospital to have their treatment in.
default Boyle has rightly noted that choice has been too closely tied with competition and the concept of “contestability”, which has led to the debate over choice being dominated by ideology rather than what is actually best for patients, parents or service users.

defaultDecentralisationdefault and diversitydefault&#xa0;
default25.
default 
defaultWhilst the
default restructuring of the NHS appears to be based on 
defaultde
defaultcentralisation with 
defaultcommissioning with clinical commissioning groups now taking the le
defaultad, 
defaultNHS England (the new commissioning board) still wields the most power, both over the CCGs and more generally within the NHS. 
defaultThus power in 
defaultWhitehall, in actual fact
default remains based on 
defaulta c
defaultentralised top-down approach and 
defaultforcing CCGs to put a number of their services out to Any Qualified Provider, when we know that most CCGs would muc
defaulth rather avoid this route. 
default&#xa0;
default26.
default 
defaultUNISON has already demonstrated in numerous submissions with the Health and Social Care 
defaultAct (
default2012) that 
defaultopening up public services does not necessarily improve the options for service users. For example, the development of private sector monopolies (or oligopolies) where services have been 
defaultand are being privatised is likely to encourage 
defaultplayers within the market 
defaultto merge, 
defaultleaving a few big non-public sector providers where previously there were a few b
defaultig public sector providers. T
defaulthe NHS the Competition Commission recently chastised the priva
defaultte hospitals sector on similar grounds
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default27.
default 
defaultUNISON is concerned that 
defaultthe recent reforms to 
defaultmarketise
default the NHS and the failure to fund the service adequately has led to the rationing of services becoming increasingly prevalent. This has meant that many patients are now faced with the option of paying to go private or having their care limited / co
defaultmpromised. Evidence of this is referenced at the footnote 
default&#xa0;
default28.
default 
defaultUNISON believes that the a
defaultccountability
default in health services with the new structures in commissioning 
defaulthas effectively removed the ultimate responsibility for the NHS from the (democratically elected) Secretary of State and handed it to the NHS commissioning board, an unelected super-
defaultquango
default. The attempt to remedy the lack of local democracy in the NHS through Health and Wellbeing Boards, although a good 
defaultidea
default is insufficiently strong to do this: HWBs lack the power to veto commissioning decisions, and they need have only one elected councillor among their number.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultQ3.default How can risks be reduced in defaultOpen access to public services under alternative forms of ownershipdefault?default&#xa0;default29.
default 
defaultUNISON has concerns that currently in the drive to open up public services and ensure open access 
defaultand minimise 
defaultrisks of alternative forms of ownership, provision and accountability
default, basic statutory duties are not being fulfilled therefore diminishing the empowerment of stakeholders and citizens and service users.
default 
defaultWe 
defaultgive the example
defaults
default of
default Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs) and Ministry of Justice Probation Reforms
default&#xa0;defaultPolice and Crime Commissionersdefault (PCCs)default&#xa0;default30.
default 
default PCCs  are 
defaultunder a new statutory obligation to publish a wide range of information to their electorates. The relevant statutory instrument is: The Elected Local Policing Bodies (Specified Information) (Amendment Order) 2012 
default&#xa0;
default31.
default 
defaultIn relation to opening up privatised police services to scrutiny, the Order promised that PCCs would have to publish:
default&#xa0;
default32.
default 
defaultThe Order requires that all the above information to be published as soon as practicable after it becomes available to the PCC.PCCs were elected in November 2012 and 10 months later UNISON can find no evidence that any of the above information has been published by PCCs. 
default&#xa0;
default33.
default 
defaultG4S currently operates one of the biggest privatised police contracts in the UK for Lincolnshire Police. In April of 2013, the company and the Lincolnshire PCC published a glossy report which made a number of claims regarding the performance of the contract. Unfortunately, in the absence of the information required to be published under the above statutory order, neither Lincolnshire voters, nor other interested parties can scrutinise the company’s claims. 
default&#xa0;
default34.
default 
defaultUNISON asks what the Government is doing to make its requirement on PCCs to publish commercial contracts, work in practice
default as part of its public service reform programme empowering the citizen and service users?
defaultMinistry of Justice Probation Reformsdefault35.
default 
defaultUnder the Ministry of Justice ‘Transforming Rehabilitation’ proposals
default, local probation services will be removed in their entirety from any potential for open access or accountability. 20 years ago, Probation was run as a local service by committees of the upper tier local authority, with local councillors on their boards and 20% or so of funding coming directly from the local authority. Local magistrates also sat on the committee. 
default&#xa0;
default36.
default 
defaultSince that time, successive governments have stripped out this local representation and funding,  and when Probation Trusts were created in 2007 all vestiges of local authority representation were finally removed. 
default&#xa0;
default37.
default 
defaultIn 2013, the Justice Secretary Chris Grayling announced radical reforms of the Probation Service to abolish the 35 local Probation Trusts, replacing them with 21 government companies, which are to be sold to the private sector in October 2014. Not only will the reduction in local entities from 35 to 21 destroy the co-
defaultterminosity
default of Probation areas with police force boundaries, but the handing of probation services to the private sector by the Secretary of State as the single commissioner and client removes at a stroke any pretence at localism or accountability for the Probation Service.
default&#xa0;
default38.
default 
default 
defaultThe creation of these new 21 private entities to run probation services undermines the public and citizens access to how their local police and justice services should be run. It undermines the ability of the elected 
defaultPolice and Crime Commissioner
defaults to be accountable in their public role to be able to influence locally the 
defaultcommissioning 
defaultof 
defaultpo
defaultlice and local justice probation services.
default&#xa0;
default39.
default 
default Although UNISON notes that 
defaultthe Justice Secretary
default has agreed
default to create a boar
defaultd to allow PCCs
default to influence the commissioning process
default it is not clear how much commissioning decision making  
defaultpower the b
defaultoard will have in the 
defaultin the contract award of 
defaultthe 21 private companies.
default&#xa0;
default40.
default 
defaultUNISON has no evidence that these new structures will 
defaultre-introduce any localism
default, open access for grass roots communities to influence local probation services through their 
defaultelected PCC
default or 
defaultprovide sound 
defaultaccounta
defaultbility into the process of how the 21 private companies will operate public probation services, particularly as the Secretary of State 
defaultremain
defaults
default sole commissioner.
default 
defaultQ4default: How can public services through co-ordinated local provision provide better value for money and local accountability?                                                                                       defaultFurther defaultEducation servicesdefault and academiesdefault default41.
default 
defaultUNISON fears that the academy programme i
defaults drawing schools nearer to the
default FE college model driven by financial imperatives and working in a service provision framework with lack of accountability or participation in a co-ordinated service to education and the community. An academy is contracted directly to government with little responsibility as a publicly-funded local educational establishment; a parent with complaints has little opportunity for redress. Without ties to the locally-elected authority, accountability is limited and citizen empowerment and democracy short-changed.
default&#xa0;
default42.
default 
defaultUNISON has continued to express concern about the impact of multi-organisational provision and 
defaultmulti-level governance and 
defaultthe difficulty in maintaining coherent and cost-effective services that reflect the needs and desires of the community
default and offer high quality services
default. 
default&#xa0;
default43.
default 
defaultThis is well demonstrated
default in 
defaultFurther 
defaulteducation services, which have not to date been run for profit beyond the independent sector, but have been subjected to a stream of structural and institutional change since the late 1980s. 
default&#xa0;
default44.
default 
defaultUNISON believes that t
defaulthis 
defaultconstant change of structures and funding and governance mechanisms are
default costly in terms of redundancy payments and re
defaultbranding. O
defaultrganisations 
defaultbecome ineffective as they 
defaulthave little time to embed

defaultconcludes that “there is insufficient evidence to make a definitive judgement about the Academies as a model for school improvement”
default. 
default&#xa0;
default47.
default 
defaultUNISON would like to see the government address some of the recommendations set out in the report which would improve open access and accountability to parents and citizens in local communities
