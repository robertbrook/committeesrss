[[[Submission from the Confederation of British Industry]]]&#xa0;There is a mixed picture of procurement performance across local authorities Local authorities need to shift from primary provider to commissioner of services and develop the necessary toolkit of skills and processes to act as an effective market stewardAn improved skills set for local authority commercial teams will allow councils to be better market managersBetter strategic leadership of major change programmes improves the likelihood of achieving the desire outcomes from a procurement processA stronger understanding of how the provider market operates, which ensures councils develop the most effective partnerships and manage risk effectivelyImproved transparency is an essential tool in building trust in markets and making them sustainableDeveloping the capacity of SMEs to participate in public sector procurements is essential, but will take time â€“ councils can support it without undermining the existing market
