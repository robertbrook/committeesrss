[[[THE EFFECT OF ‘THIRD PARTY’ PRESSURE ON POLICE CRIME RECORDING PRACTICE]]]

[[[Synopsis]]]

[[[Background]]] 

[[[considerations]]]1. The vast majority of crimes recorded as Notifiable Offences by the police are the result of complaints made to them by members of the public (individual and corporate), usually because they believe themselves to have been the victims of crime. The belief that the statistics of Recorded Crime are a true measure of the extent of crime that occurs is no longer credible since it is no longer plausible to believe that the police are the only means in society for dealing with crime, that they are capable of surveillance and investigation sufficient to detect all wrong-doing, or that the public report all the crime that they encounter. Nevertheless, the media, opinion-leaders and the police service itself often seek to foster this anachronistic view of the police for a variety of reasons. The pursuit of such a fiction leads to public scepticism and mistrust not only of police crime recording but also of the police service as a whole.2. Nowadays, recorded crime is best seen as an output measure of the public police services. The fundamental difficulty with Recorded Crime statistics is that they are at once both a measure of the demand for public police service and a measure of the supply of those services in response to that demand. Several issues compound the difficulty:

[[[Types of third-party pressure on crime recording]]]2. There are various kinds of third-party pressure on police recording, having different bearings upon complainants and police services respectively. The main types are:These various pressures upon the police can have countervailing effects upon the volume and the type of crime that they record, which may vary from place to place and time to time. Some types of crime, some types of community, and different governance regimes, may all be likely to affect police discretionary recording and therefore the volume of crimes recorded. 

[[[Systematic recording adjustment]]]3. It is also likely that police operate systematic recording discretion as a kind of management adjustment to the pressures of workload and the constraints of the resources at their disposal.  Different circumstances may lead, respectively, to different and separate pressures on police resources and accountability. Reconciling these may lead to systematic adjustments to recording practice.  For instance, when crime is going up, public and political pressure to reduce crime may increase at the same time as police workload is also increasing due to the volume of complaints with which they are obliged to deal. Hypothetically, the police may then seek to deflate the volume of recorded crime by systematic under-recording in order to reconcile these conflicting pressures. By the same token, when crime is dropping, the police may be able to afford to do (or be seen to do) more, thus relaxing the incentive to under-record. Nevertheless, if their resources are also declining (or they are incapable of making commensurate efficiency gains) they may then also seek to deflate the recorded crime rate by under-recording.

[[[The Dark, Light, and Grey Figures of crime]]]4. Since the exercise of police discretion in crime recording lies beneath the radar of public accountability, its true nature can only be investigated by means of forensic ‘case tracking’ audit methods, such as those employed by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary. Even so, while these methods look in detail at the circumstantial evidence surrounding individual recording decisions (for example, distinguishing between evidential and prima facie approaches to recording complaints), they lose something of the ‘bigger picture’ of variation in the volume of crime recording, particularly in not being able to pick-up systematic recording effects. To do so requires comparison of trends and patterns in recorded crime against the yardstick of the public’s propensity to report complaints to the police. Disparity between the propensity of the public to report crime and the propensity of the police to record crime can be inferred as the effect of systematic police recording discretion. This can result in three crime rates:

[[[? ]]]5. The police services log the calls that come in to their command and control centres from the public, a record of which is modified as a result of the report of the investigating officers, producing an outcome log of incidents attended.  In broad terms, this log can be considered a proxy measure of the demand for police service. Research was undertaken to compare rates of logged incidents resulting from calls from the public with rates of recorded crimes for a large and varied English police service area. Overall, there are many more calls to the police than there are crimes recorded from them; less than a fifth (18%) of incidents attended by the police are recorded as Notifiable Offences, giving odds of 5 to 1 against a call being recorded as a crime.  It cannot be ascertained from the data whether this under-recording is due to: 6. Table 1 suggests that the most numerous category of incidents to which the public summon the police are incidents of anti-social, disorderly or violent behaviour, although the police seem likely to record only about one-in-five of them as crime. In contrast, although much less numerous, acquisitive incidents comprise the predominant type of incident that the police decide to record as crime. Clearly, there are a variety of reasons for this disparity: while anti-social behaviour may trouble the public most, many incidents may not support or warrant a criminal prosecution; in contrast, since relatively few incidents of property crime result in prosecution, it might be surmised that their higher rate of crime recording has more to do with third-party pressures.&#xa0;

It is possible that: Whatever the reasons, these findings suggest that the statistics of recorded crime may form an imperfect and misleading measure not only of the problems faced by members of the public but also their actual need for and use of police services.

[[[’?]]]8. It may be possible to infer that systematic recording adjustment might be taking place by looking at trends in the disparity between what victims say they report to the police - e.g. to the England and Wales Crime Survey (EWCS) - and what the police record as crime (see ONS, 2013).  A comparison can be made between an index of the Volume of Reported Crime and an index of the Grey Figure (i.e. the proportion of crimes reported to the police that appear to have been recorded) for two time-periods:8. The BCS (now EWCS) records separately Burglary-with-Loss, and Nil-Loss Burglaries (including attempted burglaries). Although both offences were subject to the same crime reduction performance pressure, Burglary-with-Loss also entails (insurance-required) recording obligations, while attempted and Nil-Loss Burglaries do not (which can be seen in the much lower recording rate for the latter). Figure 1 suggests that when the volume of Burglaries-with-Loss went up, the recording rate went down, presumably reflecting a workload adjustment. Happily, when the volume of reported with-loss burglaries declined in the second period and the concomitant workload pressure subsided, the police could afford to let the recording rate rise again (almost to the maximum), thus presumably satisfying their recording obligation to the insurers without prejudicing their performance requirement with the Government. Conversely, neither insurance obligation nor crime reduction requirement apply to Nil-Loss Burglaries, so that the recording rate remained low and constant across both periods, irrespective of a similar boom-and-bust trend in the volume of this crime, as shown in Figure 2. Furthermore, since the volume of Nil-Loss Burglaries reported had declined less than the volume of With-Loss Burglaries, the former now become a proportionately bigger part of the recorded crime figure. contributing to the view that the trend in recorded burglaries might have reflected the effectiveness of household security measures rather than, perhaps, police efforts to manage their workloads.

[[[crimeing]]]

[[[’]]]?9. The practice of ‘down-crimeing’ refers to a situation where a crime is recorded as less serious or more trivial than it might be otherwise. Down-crimeing may be applied systematically to offences so as to take them out of a framework of performance indicators in order to make the performance appear to look better than it is. The inference that this may have taken place is suggested in Figure 3, which again compares trends in the ‘grey figure’ between the periods 1981-1991 and 1991-2003/04. Perhaps reflecting public concern (moral pressure) about the rise in ‘mugging’ during the earlier period, the rate of recording of Robbery had been increasing, although by 1991 this was still less than a half of the robberies that victims said they had reported to the police. However, during the latter period, the reduction of Robbery was designated as one of the Government’s crime reduction targets, which seems to have dampened the enthusiasm of the police to record the offence. That this might be a systematic down-crimeing adjustment is suggested by the increasing rate of recording of crimes that include some of the elements of the offence of Robbery but were not designated as crime reduction performance targets:These trends suggest that through systematic down-crimeing the police may have been able to continue to respond to moral pressure about violent crime while also evading the performance targets that were also supposed to reflect public concern.

[[[Summary ]]]10. The analyses presented above demonstrate three decision-processes at work in the construction of recorded crime rates:The basic decision process is that between the public and the police. Yet the influence of third-party pressure seems to have systemic effects on the police services discretionary practice of crime recording. Since Third Parties  intervene in that decision, by careful adjustment of their policies it might be possible to ‘nudge’ the public and police towards more accurate or reliable crime recording. While such alterations of the ‘choice architecture’ of crime recording might seem attractive in principle, this might not be so feasible in practice, since the kinds of third party pressures influencing crime recording also reflect the wide social and political context in which public police services are delivered currently. In the meantime, even the most careful (and costly) auditing of crime recording practice may only serve to keep the worst examples of discretionary recording in check.

Previously he has held positions at Keele University, the Universities of Manchester and Missouri-St. Louis (USA), and at CACI Ltd. He has provided expert consultancy on crime statistics for the UK Statistics Commission and evidence to the HoC Science and Technology Select Committee, and has numerous research publications based upon the analysis of British Crime Survey (BCS) and Recorded Crime data. He worked on the first generation of the BCS while serving at the Home Office Research and Planning Unit (1974-1991).  Data were kindly made available by the Chief Constable and included all calls and all recorded crimes for the year 2000, excluding road traffic incidents. Data were collected before the introduction of the NCRS, so they might not be similar to the situation now. Only a broad equivalence between incident and recorded crime codes could be established as sufficiently similar categorically. The research was funded by the Home Office, and is also presented in a slightly different form in Hope (2013; Table 3.1). The odds are calculated from the data using Bayes’ Rule, with the prior probability set as the overall recording probability (i.e. 0.18). Data are taken from the Home Office Statistical Bulletin Crime in England and Wales, 2003/04. Two indices were constructed:  (1) a Volume of Reported Crime Index (defined as the product of the Victimisation Rate (Table 2.02) and the proportion of incidents reported to the police (Table 3.02), with 1981 = 100); and (2) a Grey Figure Rate – the proportion of crimes reported to the police that appear to have been recorded (defined as the ratio of offences recorded by police (Table 3.04) to comparable crimes reported to police (Table 3.02). Unfortunately, these figures have not been made routinely available in Crime in England and Wales since the 2004/05 publication, although they have now been reported in ONS (2013). The data were collected and arranged in the same way as those in Figures 1 and 2 (see para. 7 and fn. 3 above.
