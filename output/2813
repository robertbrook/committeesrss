[normal]I have lived in the countryside around Fort William for almost forty years and have had a keen interest in the land through my love of mountains and wild paces. This has led me to learn about sustainability and also about the history of the land and the political upheavals to which it has been subjected.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A better land ownership system would be one which would encourage more equal communities and where the class system was much less obvious. This would help to engender a more confident community, more interested in involving itself in stewardship of the land. To date, the local people have had no power over the assets of the area and have thus lost interest in local politics.
[normal]The barriers prohibiting this at the moment are the powers and wealth of many of the current landowners who have very persuasive spokesmen and lawyers to tilt the system in their favour.
[normal]To address this I suggest taxing land, initially large holdings. At the moment I understand EU subsidies are paid to landowners for merely owning the land. This is, in my opinion, quite wrong.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is almost impossible for young people to buy house plots in this area for the reason that an artificial scarcity has been created and landowners will sell only a few plots at elevated prices. This discourages developers from building modestly priced houses. The emphasis is on building mansions for the very rich as second homes and of course holiday homes.
[normal]A change in the law to increase the ratio of 'affordable houses'  to larger houses would make a difference. At the moment I believe it is one affordable house to every four others. Perhaps stricter planning laws encouraging more smaller, family-sized houses and discouraging the enormous houses we are seeing mushrooming here at the moment. Young people cannot afford to live in the countryside though many would, I'm sure, like to.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A better system would encourage regeneration of sustainable ecosystems and  biodiversity. Not only would this make the countryside more attractive to visitors but it would have a marked improvement on the fertility of the land for future generations. Surely the grouse moors and deer forests are not the best solution to the degraded land we have inherited.
[normal]The creation of woodland crofts, for sale at reasonable prices would encourage people to take over small areas for environmental improvement and local economic enterprises.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The laws of inheritance, whereby a landowner can leave the whole of his estate to one person, disenfranchising his other children, has been used to keep these enormous estates intact.
[normal]A change in the laws of inheritance, ensuring children are not disinherited in this way would help to break the pattern, making the estates smaller and creating more numerous and diverse landowners.
