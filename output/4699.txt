[[[Written evidence submitted by ]]]

[[[Mr. and Mrs. C. Jones]]]&#xa0;Concerns arising from our observations of the setting up of Route 39 Academy in North Devon:&#xa0;"Evidence of demand" is required, but it seems that the evidence submitted to the DoE and the EFA by a prospective Free School is accepted at face value. No attempt is made to scrutinise how the evidence is obtained.

[[[(in the case of R39, e]]]

[[[vidence of demand was apparently obtained at open days held at a local theme park and via a website survey managed by R39 themselves)]]]&#xa0;The governors of a prospective Free School are expected to undertake a programme of consultation with the local community, but there appears to be no attempt made by the DoE to ensure that this is not just a box-ticking exercise. Again, results of these consultations appear to be accepted at face-value - there is no formal opportunity for local opposition groups to voice their concerns.

[[[(in the case of R39, all attempts by a local opposition group to engage with the governors and discuss important issues were declined, including one occasion when R39 cancelled a presentati]]]

This leads to the suspicion that the DoE would intervene if permission is refused by local planning committees.

[[[(in the case of R39, funding has been approved in spite of the fact that planni]]]

[[[lost a few pupils) ]]]&#xa0;Our concern about the academies programme is that it is possible for funding for a free school to be approved with very little evidence of demand for the school, with little or no public consultation and without planning permission first being granted for the proposed site. Furthermore, not enough consideration is given to the impact on other schools in the area.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
