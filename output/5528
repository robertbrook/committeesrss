[normal]T
[normal]raining and education 
[normal]is not
[normal] enough 
[normal]of a 
[normal]priority
[normal] for prison governors and other senior staff. Accoun
[normal]tability for the quality 
[normal]of
[normal] provision is weak and must be addressed urgently
[normal](p.6).

[normal]The quality of learning and skills work in 
[normal]prisons
[normal] [bold]was poor. It had the largest proportion of inadequate provision across the whole of the FE and skills sector. 
[normal]In prisons, 
[normal]‘leadership and managemen
[normal]t of learning and skills and work’
[normal] was judged
[normal] to be inadequate or as requires improvement in 22 (58%) of the 38 prison reports published by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Prisons (p.10).

[normal]Prison r
[normal]egimes often disrupted learning and work 
[normal]related activities, r
[normal]esulting in poor attendance and punctuality.
[normal] Furthermore, t
[normal]ake-up of pro
[normal]vision in English and math
[normal]s was often very low compared with the leve
[normal]l of need assessed at induction
[normal]. 
[normal]Overall, far too few prisons were preparing prisoners adequately for resettlement 
[normal]and employment with good quality education and training.

[normal]Despite Ofsted’s negative findings, they also saw 
[normal]pockets of excellent pra
[normal]ctice in prisons (p.11)
[normal]. The most effective provision was vocational training where the prison worked in close partn
[normal]ership with employers.
[normal]PLA evidence in response to Ofsted’s findings[bold]Ofsted’s
[normal] finding
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]must
[normal] be seen within the context of
[normal] unprecedented change and
[normal] reforms 
[normal]within the Criminal Justice System. These include;

[normal]Given the above context it is crucial that government departments
[normal] (
[normal]BIS, MoJ and DWP
[normal])
[normal] whose policies all have an impact on prisoner learning, un
[normal]dertake a joined up approach
[normal]; co-ordinating policies, aligning outcome targets and working together to achieve overall rehabilitation outcomes.
