[[[ [FBB0008]]]]&#xa0;As a licence payer, I massively value the BBC – not just its quality out, but its public service ethos and the breadth of its delivery. It is by a considerable distance the best broadcaster in the UK, if not the world.I do however have some concerns about its political reporting. Research by Cardiff University found that its reporting has a politically conservative stance and I think that has been increasingly eident in recent years. It has given a very soft ride to the government’s controversial (and unsuccessful) austerity programme and its unpopular NHS reforms, often ignoring the NHS debate (the NHS does need change, but not partial privatisation). It runs a lot of anti-Europe material and gives huge publicity to UKIP, a minority party which has extreme right wing views and no MPs, including very frequently featuring its leader on Question Time. And the political coverage following the period after the last election when there was no clear winner was astonishingly pro-Conservative, implying that Gordon brown was somehow clinging on to power rather than doing his constitutional duty. It perhaps doesn’t help that its main political commentators, Andrew Neil and Nick Robinson, are known Conservatives.This is why I find it extraordinary and perplexing that the right wing press suggest the BBC is a left-leaning organisation…nothing could be further from the truth, as the Cardiff research shows.Like most people in this country, I value the BBC and its ethos – the last thing we need is a commercial free-for-all where the likes of Sky (and Fox?) distor our news in the way the largely right wing press does. I am happy to continue to pay the licence fee and hope that the recent bullying of the BBC by grant Shapps is given short shrift.&#xa0;October 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
