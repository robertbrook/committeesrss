defaultWritten evidence submitted by defaultFPA and Brook default[OLS0066]default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultAbout FPAdefault&#xa0;defaultFPA is one of the UK’s leading sexual health charities. Our mission is to help establish a society in which everyone has positive, informed and non-judgmental attitudes to sex and relationships; where everyone can make informed choices about sex and reprod
defaultuction so that they can enjoy sexual health free from prejudice or harm. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe do this through providing a comprehensive sexual health information service for professionals and the public, running community based sex and relationships education programmes a
defaultnd campaigning to ensure that high quality sexual health information and services are available to all who need them.

defaultAbout Brdefaultookdefault&#xa0;defaultBrook is the UK’s leading provider of sexual health services and advice for young people under 25. Our mission is to ensure young people can enjoy their sexuality without harm.
default defaultBrook services provide free and confidential sexual health information, co
defaultntraception, pregnancy testing, advice and counselling, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections and outreach and education work, reaching over 290,000 young people every year. 
default&#xa0;
defaultBrook believes that every young person in Britain deserves 
defaultsex and relationships education (SRE) that is relevant to them, focuses on relationships as well as sex, honest about human sexuality and taught by professionals who are well prepared and confident. Sex and relationships are a life skill, as important to o
defaultur future health and happiness as any other subject, and young people deserve to be heard.

default&#xa0;defaultSummarydefault&#xa0;
defaultBrook and FPA 
defaultwelcome the focus on pr
defaultotecting young
default people from harm. Young people are vulnerable from online environments in a number of ways, which are not just about access to pornography. These include grooming, bullying and exploitation, and it is important that this Inquiry does not seek to dispropor
defaulttionately focus on pornography in comparison to these other important areas of consideration. Certainly,
default we know that 
defaultsimply blocking internet content is not a cure-all
default, and the role of education 
defaultin supporting young people’s safe navigation of the online e
defaultnvironment 
defaultis 
defaultkey
default. 
defaultTherefore we
default strongly advise for the need to
default talk about education for young people and support for parents at the same time.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn particular, w
defaulte would be concerned if actions resulting from a review of filtering
default meant that legitimate educ
defaultatio
defaultn websites
default were blocked
default as well.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn summary:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultBrook’s young people’s response to defaultthis Inquirydefault&#xa0;defaultTo inform this response, Brook asked
default groups of young people across the country to consider their views of the questions and th
defaultemes raised in this Inquiry
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThese groups included young people who identified as LGB and T
default (Lesbian, Gay Bisexual and Transgender)
default, male, female and non-binary, 
defaultBME
default (Black, Minority, 
defaultEthnic
default communities)
default, experience of mental health, experience of homelessness, and as young offenders. A summary of their conclusions is provided here and a full copy of the report can be found in Annex A of this document.
default&#xa0;
defaultConclusio
defaultns from young people’s response
default&#xa0;
default“If young people want to access porn, out of arousal or curiosity, that's perfectly healthy and typical. However, easy access to porn needs to be supplemented with good sex education and lessons about internet awareness and
default safety, as well as an open and non-judgemental societal attitude towards sex and sexuality.”
default&#xa0;
default(
defaultanonymised
default quote from young people’s response)
default&#xa0;
defaultThe feedback from the young people shows that, broadly speaking, 
defaultit is clear that
default young people need better, more
default inclusive education on internet safety, both for children and for parents, 
defaultnot least 
defaultto ensure that knowledge, skills and understanding around online safety are embedded in the next generation. This would support a societal shift in the bullying culture w
defaulthich has developed around social media, without imposing enforced censorship which could inhibit young people’s ability to access accurate information about sex. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCompulsory education on internet safety, covering issues which include pornography and cyber
default bullying, would allow young people to explore and understand their developing sexuality whilst reducing any risk of harm.
default&#xa0;
defaultRESPONSE TO QUESTIONSdefault&#xa0;
default1. defaultHow best to protect minors from accessing adult content?default&#xa0;
default1.1 
defaultIn order to protect minors from accessing adult content 
defaultwe must provide young people with the support, education, skills and understan
defaultding to ensure that they
default are not damaged by, pressured into or exploited through exposure to porn and that they are able t
defaulto cope with the availability of pornography, on and offline. 
default&#xa0;
default1.2 
defaultHowever, 
defaultBrook and FPA do not believe that it is possible or right to simply prevent young people 
defaultaccessing pornography. 
defaultWe make a clear distinction between child abuse and pornography, and indeed censorship and protection. 
defaultWe 
defaultalso 
defaultwelcome
default the focus 
defaultof this Inquiry 
defaulton protecting you
defaultng people from harm and condemn
default all images of child abuse
default,
default which are illegal. 
default&#xa0;
default1.3 
defaultBrook’s re
defaultsearch with
default defaultgroups of young people suggests:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default1.4 
defaultIn terms of how young people would like to better deal with 
defaultpornography they may see, 
defaultBrook and FPA recommend
default an educational approach which helps young people to:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultParents
default&#xa0;
default1.5 
defaultBrook and FPA 
defaultbelieve
default that parents should be better enabled and encouraged to
default take responsibility for supervising their children and setting appropriate safety settings
default,
default particularly
default if they have young children who may be vulnerable
default to seeing images that 
defaultthey 
defaultmight find
default distressing. The young people 
defaultwe spoke with 
defaultpointed out that there are existing safety settings which are very good 
defaultfilters
default.
default 
defaultThey felt that if safety settings are used appropriately then young people would not come across adult content when searching for 
defaultsomething else.
default&#xa0;
default“We don't need to create new 
defaultfilters,
default we just need to educate parents about how to use existing safety settings.” 
defaultYoung woman, 16.
default&#xa0;
default“Educate the parents, who can in turn educate the children.” 
defaultYoung person, 18.
default&#xa0;
default1.6 
defaultTo enable parents to 
defaultact accordingly, they suggested that education should be provided to parents so that they are able to understand and set parent
defaultal controls. The young people that Brook
default spoke to all knew how to 
defaultset controls
default themselves, describing the process as simple, and 
defaultfelt that 
defaultwith the right level of intervention and education from parents, 
defaultthere should be no reason why children should see adult content if they 
defaultor their parents deem the material disturbing
default. 
defaultThey suggested developing leaflets, posters or training/workshops for parents, explaining how simple it is to set these controls. 
default&#xa0;
default“Educate parents on how young people access what they do and make it so that young people know that they can talk to their p
defaultarents or someone they trust if they have seen something that makes them distressed.”
default Young person, 20
default&#xa0;
default“Individual guidance by parents to ensure children 
defaultdon't
default find this material. If a parent is present, even if they do find it, it can be explained proper
defaultly, explained why it's wrong and why not to go back to the site.” 
defaultYoung person, 18.
default&#xa0;
default1.7 
defaultParenting support programmes such as the FPA’s Speakeasy
default programme (see below) can help parents build up the knowledge and skills they need to enable them to discuss 
defaultissues around sex, relationships and growing up with their children and teach them key skills in these areas. 
defaultIn turn, developing a stronger dialogue between parents and children can help build the co
defaultnfidence of the children to
default be more open with their pare
defaultnts about what they may have seen.
default&#xa0;
defaultSpeakeasy
default&#xa0;
default1.8 
defaultSpeakeasy
default is a FPA course for parents and carers to better enable them to engage with the children for 
defaultwh
defaultich
default they are responsible, on
default often tric
defaultky issues surrounding
default sex and relationships. FPA knows that many parents and carers want to talk with their children about issues associated with growing up, including sex and relationships, but many are embarrassed or unsure about where to start and what to say. 
default&#xa0;
default1.9 
defaultFPA has
default developed the Speakeasy programme to enable parents and carers to develop the skills, knowledge and confidence to have these sometimes difficult conversations. The community-based project runs over eight weeks and covers factual information including how 
defaultto keep children and young people safe; the pressures young people may be under; and strategies for proactively starting 
defaultdiscussions on growing up, sex and relationships. The course is accredited by the Open College Network, which gives parents the opportu
defaultnity to receive credits for the work they do, which they can then apply in further learning or in employment. 
default&#xa0;
default1.10 
defaultEvaluations of the project have demonstrated the positive impact it has on parents’ knowledge, confidence and their relationships with thei
defaultr children. A Social Return on Investment (SROI) analysis of the programme has estimated the total value of benefits to children and parents and to the state to be £21 million. The value to the state represents a return of £5.29 for every pound of public m
defaultoney invested in the project. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSex and Rela
defaultt
defaultionships Education 
default(SRE) 
defaultand the role of s
defaultchools
default&#xa0;
default1.11 
defaultBrook and FPA believe that parents and 
defaultcarers
default play a crucial role in giving information and advice to children and young people about sex, relationships and
default growing up. However, a
defaultlthough parents and 
defaultcarers
default absolutely have a role to play in protecting minors from accessing potentially damaging online material, according to the National Association of Head Teachers, 83% of parents also had sufficient confidence
default in schools' ability to help their children understand the dangers specifically associated with pornography, and that they believed teachers were as important as parents in handling the issue. Just 13% thought it should be left to parents alone to educate 
defaultchildren about pornography (NAHT survey, May 2013)
default 
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default1.12 
defaultIndeed, Brook and FPA strongly believe SRE must cove
defaultr many issues relating to this I
defaultnquiry beyond porn, including 
defaultsexting
default, making friends and relationships online, bullying, and safety in relationships. 
default&#xa0;
default1.13 
defaultIn order to achieve this, 
defaultBrook 
defaultand 
defaultFPA 
defaultbe
defaultlieve that the best strategy
default is a joint home-school programme between schools, parents 
defaultand young people. 
defaultWe should also acknowledge that many parents, despite the
defaultir
default best intentions, will still fee
defaultl
default too awkward to have conversation
defaults
default about sex with their children. Furthermore, schools are widely
default regarded as an 
defaultappropriate and 
defaultimpartial ground 
defaultfor such discussions.
default&#xa0;
default1.14 
defaultThis sentiment is supported by Brook’s discussion with young people who said that
default internet safety should be 
defaulttaught in school, including about
default how to set controls. Brook and FPA support the young people’s suggestion that educator
defaults could explain to children that there are images on the internet which may not be suitable, talk to them about what it means, and teach them how to avoid it. Furthermore, children should be taught that there are some things on the internet that they may f
defaultind disturbing and that there are 
defaultpeople they can talk to if they do see something that upsets
default them.
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultI think education is more important than sheltering young people and just pretending they are not there, because they would no doubt find them anyway.”
default 
defaultY
defaultoung Person, 18.
default&#xa0;
default“Better education in schools. Explain to them that those films are not real, and are actors.”
default 
defaultYoung person, 20.
default&#xa0;
default“I think educating young people on the different types of images etc is also important to ensure that when they are faced with such things they know how to deal with them.” 
defaultYoung person, 23.

defaultSRE and the prevention of sexual abuse, sexual exploitation 
defaultand domestic and sexual violence
default&#xa0;
default1.15 
defaultIn its May 2013 report into PSHE, 
defaultOfsted
default states that l
defaultack
default of age-appropriate sex and relationships education may leave young people vulnerable to inappropriate sexual behaviours and sexual exploitation, particularly i
defaultf they are not taught the appropriate language, or have not developed the confidence to describe unwanted behaviours, or do not know who to go to for help
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.16 
defaultSRE can play a role in keeping children and young people safe. SRE aims to equip children and
default young people with language and skills to understand appropriate and inappropriate 
defaultbehaviour
default, be able to resist pressure and to know who to talk to and how to access help and support when they need it.
default&#xa0;
default1.17 
defaultSpecifically
default Brook 
defaultand 
defaultFPA believe that in the 
defaultcontext of online safety, SRE could be used to teach young people as follows: 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default1.18 
defaultThe backing for this is clear. In May 2013, a 
defaultYouGov
default opinion poll found that 86% of UK adults 
defaultbelieve that sex and relationships education “which addresses sexual consent and respectful relationships” should be compulsory in secondary schools
default.

defaultFPA has developed a course and booklet which su

default of young people.
default&#xa0;
default1.19 
defaultThese resources help teachers to plan lessons on the very sensitive su

defaultThese resources meet official guidance for students at Key stages 3 and 4 with, and include 
defaultdifferent lesson plans and training options for each stage. The booklet also includes a CD-ROM with video clips, images and PowerPoint presentations suitable for use with Key stage 3 and 4 students, and was produced by the Brighton &amp; Hove Healthy Schools T

default&#xa0;
default1.24 
defaultCurrently, maintained schools must have regard to the (as was) Department for Education and Employment’s, 
defaultSex and Relationship Education Guidance
default 
default(2000). This guidance 
defaultpre-dates the Sexual Offences Act 2003, the repeal of Section 28 of the Local Government Act and the 2010 Equalities legislation which includes the recommendation that schools teach gender equality and non-violent, respectful relationships between women an
defaultd men.
default&#xa0;
default This current Government SRE guidance also pre-dates recent and emerging issues on technology and safeguarding, with no reference to addressing on-line safety, '
defaultsexting
default' or pornography in SRE. 
default&#xa0;
default1.25 
defaultBrook 
defaultand 
defaultFPA recommen
defaultd that the Government shoul
defaultd up
defaultdate SRE guidance for the modern era.
default&#xa0;
default2. How best to filter out extremist material, including images of child abuse and material intended to promote terrorism or other acts of violence?default&#xa0;
defaultWhen children start to hit puberty
default,
default then without places where they can talk about sex in a positive way (and not just mechanics) then they will go looking for potentially harmful images, and in the world we live in it is virtually impossible to censor those completely.”
default 
defaultYoung person, 18.
default&#xa0;
default2.1 
defaultAny proposal to restrict young people’s access to extreme material online will be fraught with complication and difficult to implement. Filters must be sophisticated to allow for a range of factors (for example, households with children of different ag
defaultes, and differing definitions of pornography). Part of supporting young people through education is ensuring they have access to good quality, factual information on sexual health online. Attempts to restrict young people’s access to pornography may inadve
defaultrtently lead to the blocking of good quality education sites. 
default&#xa0;
default2.2 
defaultAlthough y
defaultoung people have told us that while they are concerned about pornography and would like help and support dealing with it, we must 
defaultalso 
defaultacknowledge that a block can only go so far
default and as discussed in our response to Question 1, we should ensure we 
defaultpromote the need for
default education for young people and support for parents at the same time.
default&#xa0;
defaultDefining ‘extremist’
default&#xa0;
default2.3 
defaultBrook and FPA support the views of the young people interviewed by 
defaultBrook
default and that it is 
defaultimportant to give consideration to what is deemed 
default‘
defaultextremist
default’
default. They were clear that images of child abuse or bestiality should be banned, but some felt that censoring images of bondage, for example, is wrong because acts of bondage may
default be consensual. They were clear that there is a huge difference between sexual violence and consensual acts of bondage. There was also concern from young people who identify as LGB
default and 
defaultT that some of the porn they can relate to might be labeled as “extremi
defaultst” whereas in fact porn involving
default, for example,
default trans* individuals often reinforces their identity and sense of self, rather than being fetishistic. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAddressing the issue at the source
default&#xa0;
default2.4 
defaultSome of the young people 
defaultthat Brook
default spoke with 
defaultalso 
defaultfelt that 
defaultresponsibility should be placed on the websites which host extreme materials. Rather than being an issue of filters, the issue should be addressed at the source.
default&#xa0;
default“Surely the issue should be with the websites themselves existing, rather than blocking out young people's free will to surf the web. We should be tackling the websites themselves, rather than blocking access to them...” 
defaultYoung person, 20.
default&#xa0;
default“Make the promot
defaultion and creation of website such as these illegal and ensure that it's an offence that the police take active force to enforce.” 
defaultYoung person, 23.
default&#xa0;
default2.5 
defaultFurthermore, Brook 
defaultand FPA 
defaultwould like to point out that although online pornography will almost always 
defaultshow consenting adults, it rarely shows that the consent leading to the actions being undertaken has been pre-discussed and negotiated. This leads to a perception that it is somehow acceptable to quickly engage in sexual acts that others may find extreme, 
defaultwithout gaining the permission of all parties involved. Brook
default and FPA 
defaultrecommend that the perception of 
defaultthis needs
default to change, and 
defaultthe
default Government 
defaultshould implement 
defaultpolicy which leads to pornography websites showing the consent and negotiation that leads to the sexual acts which are shown. 
default&#xa0;
default3. How best to preventdefault abusive or threatening comments on social mediadefault?default&#xa0;
default“Educating young people about how some people on the i
defaultnternet use anonymity and personas to try to hurt or control other people; and how to identify spaces in which they feel safe and unsafe so they can find spaces on the internet that suit them best. I would also foster a society in which people didn't feel 
defaultthey needed to use the internet (or anything else) to dominate others, but that would take a while.”
default 
defaultYoung person, 24.
default&#xa0;
default3.1 
defaultBrook and FPA concur with the views of the young people interviewed by Brook that cyber bullying should not be looked at in isolatio
defaultn, and that it is just one facet to the much wider issue of bullying generally. The solution is not as simple as increasing b
defaultlocking or reporting options. W
defaulthat is
default really
default required is a societal shift in attitudes around respect and how we treat others. The media, in 
defaultall its formats, has an important role to play in this shift
default, particularly in enforcing a message that there are no unhealthy sexual or societal norms that you
defaultng people should feel that they should have to live up to with regards to their sexuality and sexual 
defaultbehaviour
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHelping young people to understand abusive and threatening 
defaultbehaviour
default&#xa0;
default3.2 
defaultFurther to our response to Question 1, Brook 
defaultand 
defaultFPA 
defaultfirmly believe
default that quality S
defaultRE 
defaultas part of PSHE should encompass education 
defaultthat helps
default 
defaultpupils
default understand why people bully
default, and to teach them
default to react in a way that is both responsible and appropriate to their individual circumstances. 
default&#xa0;
default“Teach the children to be 
defaultunderstanding of the harsh semiotics of the internet, and how to be emotionally resilient and secure.”
default 
defaultYoung person, 18.
default&#xa0;
default“You need to teach children to take advantage of the ability to block people on websites and use high privacy settings.”
default 
defaultYoung person,
default 18.
default&#xa0;
default3.3 
defaultThe young people that Brook
default spoke with also
default suggested targeting the bullies or potential bullies and increasing understanding of power dynamics through education. 
default&#xa0;
default“If you want to solve society's problems, you need to start at the source.” 
defaultYoung person, 16.
default&#xa0;
default“Education is 
defaultkey
default. Having the appropriate education at school will help people 
defaultrealise
default that being a keyboard warrior is not constructive.”
default 
defaultYoung person, 20.
default&#xa0;
default3.4 
defaultAs mentioned in our response to Question 1 under the ‘SRE and the preventio
defaultn of sexual abuse, sexual exploitation and domestic and sexual violence’ section, teaching about abuse 
defaulthas the potential to help both 
defaultthe perpetrators and potential victims of bullying and abuse
default. Brook and FPA 
defaultstrongly recommend the need for quality SRE as
default part of PSHE education to be fully implemented across all school settings
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe need for a transparent internet culture
default&#xa0;
default3.5 
defaultThe young people that Brook spoke with,
default described some innovative ideas about having more transparent internet culture, where websites should have clear terms of reference, including whether
default the website allows free speech, which some people may find offensive. Where ‘free speech which some peop
defaultle may find offensive’ is endorsed,
default 
defaultusers of these websites
default should therefore
default be prepared for the fact that
default&#xa0;
defaultothers can say what they like; or whether it is a friendly and respectful community, where people will be removed if they post something th
defaultat is offe
defaultnsive. The obvious benefit of implementing such a system is that
default young people would be enabled to exercise choice over what type of online community they choose to be part of.
default&#xa0;
default3.6 
defaultThe
default young people also highlighted the importance of social media sites developing smooth mechanisms to ensure that trolls are dealt with quickly and appropriately. One young person suggested that in addition to trolls being blocked from social media sites whe
defaultre they demonstrate 
defaultabusive 
defaultbehaviour
default,
default large fines
default could also
default be introduced in order
default to reinforce the anti-bullying commitment.
default&#xa0;
default“Introduction of a procedure allowing anonymous trolls/abusers to be reported to either the website administration or the polic

defaultIn addition to the need to report trolls and bullies, s
defaultome young people 
defaultthat Brook spoke with 
defaultalso felt 
defaultthat more could be done to support children who do find dis
defaulttressing or extremist images on
defaultline, and one particularly helpful idea was to enact a help/ 
defaultwhistleblowing
default button on websites so that children can be immediately directed to reputable professional 
defaultorganisations
default and get advice about what they have experienced.
default&#xa0;
default“Have a number/email/button that they can get in contact with so that if the see something inappropriate they can tell someone with influence who can do the right thing and reassure the young

default of aspects of online safety that are currently raising concerns, in particular:
default&#xa0;
defaultBrook will be submitting a written response to 
defaultthe inquiry where we will
default pull together recent policy and lines on the issue. Young people’s views will form a key element of this
default response.
default&#xa0;defaultMethoddefaultIn order to ensure that young people’s views were accurately represented in Brook’s response to the CMS inquiry, the Participation Lead created an online survey, which was promoted via our 
defaultBeSexPositive
default social media channels, and
default asked groups of young people across the country to consider their views of the questions and themes raised in this Inquiry. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThese groups included young people who identified as LGB and T (Lesbian, Gay Bisexual and Transgender), male, female and non-bina
defaultry, BME
default (Black, Minority, 
defaultEthnic
default communities)
default, experience of mental health, experience of homelessness, and as young offenders. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultFindingsdefault&#xa0;defaultQuestion 1) defaultSomedefault internet sites, for example those that show graphic images of sexual violence, are defaultusually considered as inappropriate for young people under the age of 18. What do you think are the best ways to protect children, or younger young people, from accessing images that they might find distressing?default&#xa0;
defaultThe young people were really clear that the
defaultre needs to be a distinction between protection and censorship. They felt it was important to 
defaultrecognise
default the fact that some young people will be purposefully seeking out porn for a variety of reasons, including being intrigued about sex. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThey felt that pa
defaultrents need to take responsibility for supervising their children and setting appropriate safety settings if they have young children who may be vulnerable to seeing images that they might find distressing. The young people pointed out that there are existi
defaultng safety settings which are very good 
defaultfilters
default. They felt that if safety settings are used appropriately then young people would not come across adult content when searching for something else.
default&#xa0;
default“Educate the parents, who can in turn educate the children.” 
defaultYoung person, 18.
default&#xa0;
defaultTo enable parents to act accordingly, they suggested that education should be provided to parents so that they are able to understand and set parental controls. The young people we spoke to all knew how to do this themselves, describing 
defaultthe process as simple, and felt that there should be no reason why children should see adult content if they don't want to. 
default&#xa0;
default“We don't need to create new 
defaultfilters,
default we just need to educate parents about how to use existing safety settings.” 
defaultYoung woman, 16.
default&#xa0;
defaultThey suggested developing leaflets, posters or training/workshops for parents, explaining how simple it is to set these controls. 
default&#xa0;
default“I think to help keep children from accessing images which may cause distress, parents and 
defaultcarers
default need to take responsibil
defaultity to discuss these subjects with their children and as well as the need to make sure these kind of sites are not accessible if they have children under 18.”
default 
defaultYoung person, 15.
default&#xa0;
defaultThey also felt strongly that young people should be taught about internet safe
defaultty in school and taught how to set controls themselves. They suggested that educators could explain to children that there are image on the internet which may not be suitable, talk to them about what it means, and teach them how to avoid it. They thought t
defaulthat children should be taught that there are some things on the internet that they may find disturbing and that there are people they can talk to, if they do see something that upsets them.

default“
defaultI think education is more important than sheltering young people
default and just pretending they are not there, because they would no doubt find them anyway.”
default 
defaultYoung Person, 18.
default&#xa0;
default“Better education in schools. Explain to them that those films are not real, and are actors.”
default 
defaultYoung person, 20.
default&#xa0;
default“Making young people and parents awa
defaultre of how to block distressing images and educating children and younger young people about who to speak to if they come across something they find upsetting.”
default 
defaultYoung person, 24.
default&#xa0;
default“Educate parents on how young people access what they do and make it so that 
defaultyoung people know that they can talk to their parents or someone they trust if they have seen something that makes them distressed.”
default Young person, 20
default&#xa0;
default“I think educating young people on the different types of images etc is also important to ensure that whe
defaultn they are faced with such things they know how to deal with them.” 
defaultYoung person, 23.
default&#xa0;
defaultSome young people also gave suggestions about how safeguards could be improved to ensure that children are not able to access adult content.
default&#xa0;
default“Require date of birth conf
defaultirmation before entering, have captions preceding these images warning of graphic content.” 
defaultYoung person
default, 
default21.
default&#xa0;
default“Ensuring that 
defaultthere's better parental controls
default, rather than just having to click a button to say you are over the age, instead asking the parent
default to enter the password. I also think that there should be better control over sites use of pop-ups and advertising on other websites that are harmless and have nothing to do with porn.” 
defaultYoung person, 23.
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 2) What ways do you think would be best tdefaulto protect children and young people from extremist material, such as images of child abuse and sites that promote terrorism or other acts of violence?default&#xa0;defaultFirst of all, the young people thought it was important to give consideration to what is considered extremist. They were clear that images of child abuse or bestiality should be banned, but some felt that censoring images of bondage, for example, is wrong 
defaultbecause it may be consensual. They were clear that there is a huge difference between sexual violence and consensual acts of bondage. There was also concern from young people who identify as LGBT that porn that they can relate to might be 
defaultlabelled
default as “extr
defaultemist” whereas in fact porn involving trans* individuals often reinforces their identity and sense of self, rather than being fetishistic. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAgain, the young people highlighted the importance of open and honest discussion, and comprehensive education, to i
defaultnform children of the dangers of accessing certain sites, and the importance of education for parents to enable them to have those potentially difficult discussions, whilst also learning about how to use appropriate parental controls. 
default&#xa0;default“I believe [that th
defaulte way] to truly protect children from extremist material... is [by having] positive shared discussion, with family, 
defaultcarers
default or teachers when possible, about the subjects.”
default 
defaultYoung person, 15.
default&#xa0;
default“Individual guidance by parents to ensure children 
defaultdon't
default find this
default material. If a parent is present, even if they do find it, it can be explained properly, explained why it's wrong and why not to go back to the site.” 
defaultYoung person, 18.
default&#xa0;
defaultSome of the young people also felt that responsibility should be placed on the websit
defaultes which host extremist materials. Rather than being an issue of filters, the issue should be addressed at the source.
default&#xa0;
default“Surely the issue should be with the websites themselves existing, rather than blocking out young people's free will to surf the web. We should be tackling the websites themselves, rather than blocking access to them...” 
defaultYoung person, 20.
default&#xa0;
default“Make the promot
defaultion and creation of website such as these illegal and ensure that it's an offence that the police take active force to enforce.” 
defaultYoung person, 23.
default&#xa0;
defaultSome young people also felt that more could be done to support children who do find distressing or extremis
defaultt images on line.
default&#xa0;
default“Have a number/email/button that they can get in contact with so that if the see something inappropriate they can tell someone with influence who can do the right thing and reassure the young person.”
default 
defaultYoung person, 20.
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 3) defaultWhatdefault do you think are the best ways that young people can be kept safe from abusive or threatening comments on social media? If you were in charge, how would you deal with internet trolls?default&#xa0;defaultThere was a strong focus from young people that cyber bullying should 
defaultnot be looked at in isolation, and that it is just one facet to the much wider issue of bullying generally. 
defaultThey felt that the 
defaultsolution is not as simple as increasing blocking or reporting options, and that what is required is a societal shift in attitudes
default around respect and how we treat others.
default&#xa0;
defaultThey suggested that all children and young people should receive education about relationships so that they can understand bullying and why people bully. 
default&#xa0;
default“Teach the children to be understanding of the harsh semio
defaulttics of the internet, and how to be emotionally resilient and secure.”
default 
defaultYoung person, 18.
default&#xa0;
default“You need to teach children to take advantage of the ability to block people on websites and use high privacy settings.”
default 
defaultYoung person, 18.
default&#xa0;
defaultThey suggested targeting t
defaulthe bullies or potential bullies and increasing understanding of power dynamics through education. 
default&#xa0;
default“If you want to solve society's problems, you need to start at the source.” 
defaultYoung person, 16.
default&#xa0;
default“Education is 
defaultkey
default. Having the appropriate education at 
defaultschool will help people 
defaultrealise
default that being a keyboard warrior is not constructive.”
default 
defaultYoung person, 20.
default&#xa0;
defaultThey also described some innovative ideas about having more transparent internet culture, where websites should have clear terms of reference, including 
defaultwhether the website allows free speech, and therefore people need to be prepared for the fact that
default&#xa0;
defaultothers can say what they like; or whether it is a friendly and respectful community, where people will be removed if they post something that is offensive. T
defaulthen young people would be enabled to exercise choice over what type of online community they choose to be part of.
default&#xa0;
default“Educating young people about how some people on the internet use anonymity and personas to try to hurt or control other people; and how to 
defaultidentify spaces in which they feel safe and unsafe so they can find spaces on the internet that suit them best. I would also foster a society in which people didn't feel they needed to use the internet (or anything else) to dominate others, but that would 
defaulttake a while.”
default 
defaultYoung person, 24.
default&#xa0;
defaultThey young people also highlighted the importance of social media sites developing smooth mechanisms to ensure that trolls are dealt with quickly and appropriately. One young person suggested that in addition to trolls bei
defaultng blocked from social media sites where they demonstrate abusive 
defaultbehaviour
default, they could also impose 
default“large fines!”
default to reinforce the anti-bullying commitment.
default&#xa0;
default“Introduction of a procedure allowing anonymous trolls/abusers to be reported to either the websi
defaultte administration or the police.”
default 
defaultYoung person, 18.
default&#xa0;
default“Sufficient justice for trolls, better functioning 'flagging' on social media sites”.
default 
defaultYoung man, 20.
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 4) The Government is worried that children and young people can find porn too easily. What defaultdo you think? And if you were Prime Minister what would you do?default&#xa0;default“I believe if the Government 
defaultfeel
default the porn is too accessible and want to ensure young people don't see it, they should improve the sex education in schools. As porn is usually viewed by young
default people who are not entirely sure or can't understand sex, are intrigued to see what people do when they have sex (as this is not the kind of information we find out in sex education, we tend to only get the "mate and 
defaultfertilisation
default" and how to avoid becomi
defaultng pregnant) especially LGBT youth. If I was prime minister I would insist more in depth sex education and awareness about LGBT sexual relationships.”
default 
defaultYoung person, 15.
default&#xa0;
default“I think it is more to do with education, I accessed pornographic images from the age o
defaultf 11 and this was a lot to do with my own questions about my body and sexuality, but I was never given any outlet or information about these images, it was just not talked about at all throughout education[...] When children start to hit puberty then witho
defaultut places where they can talk about sex in a positive way (and not just mechanics) then they will go looking for potentially harmful images, and in the world we live in it is virtually impossible to censor those completely.”
default 
defaultYoung person, 18.
default&#xa0;
default“Mandatory r
defaultelationship education that rolls on into sex education from a VERY young age.”
default 
defaultYoung person, 18.
default&#xa0;
default“Porn is not always a negative thing. Masturbation feels good; I enjoy watching porn when I masturbate... who are the government to intervene? If the 
defaultgovernment continues to speak about porn in this way it's steering us away from the goal of sex being more openly discussed in society. Look at the media...all of these over 
defaultsexualised
default adverts and graphic scenes in films - blocking porn sites is a waste of
default time, instead they should be regulated; and young people should learn more about porn in schools.”
default 
defaultYoung person, 20.
default&#xa0;
default“If young people want to access porn, out of arousal or curiosity, that's perfectly healthy and typical. However, easy access to porn nee
defaultds to be supplemented with good sex education and lessons about internet awareness and safety, as well as an open and non-
defaultjudgemental
default societal attitude towards sex and sexuality.”
default 
defaultYoung person, 24.
default&#xa0;
default“I think there is imagery that could be considered pornog
defaultraphic everywhere (advertising, newsagents, etc) I think that the focus should be on educating children and young people about sex and parents essentially doing their job of parenting.”
default 
defaultYoung person, 21.
default&#xa0;
default“Enforce education. The sex 
defaulted
default bill hasn't been upd
defaultated since 2000, predating all internet issues. This would be a cause for outrage in any other subject.”
default Young man, 20.
default&#xa0;
default“I would leave the porn industry as is. They already have age warnings on 
defaultwebsites,
default many programs can be installed by parents that auto
defaultmatically block these websites (without infringing on adults and young people exploring their sexuality). Porn is 
defaultlabelled
default as 18+, but it's undeniable that many teens watch porn and watch it safely. For many people it's a major way of exploring their sexua
defaultlity, being sexually satisfied and learning about themselves in a safe environment with no chance of disease and if they find a problem they just need to hit the close button.” 
defaultYoung person, 18.
default&#xa0;
default“I think that it's more important that young people receive 
defaultbetter sex and relationship education in school to ensure that they are appropriately informed that porn is not reality and to help them understand what real sex and relationships look like.”
default 
defaultYoung person, 23.
default&#xa0;
defaultConclusiondefaultIn conclusion, it is clear that the young people we spoke to demand better, more inclusive education on internet safety, both for children and for parents, to ensure that knowledge, skills and understanding around online safety are embedded in the next gen
defaulteration. This would support a societal shift in the bullying culture which has developed around social media, without imposing enforced censorship which could inhibit young people’s ability to access accurate information about sex. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCompulsory education o
defaultn internet safety, covering issues which include pornography and cyber bullying, would allow young people to explore and understand their developing sexuality whilst reducing any risk of harm.

default Unfortunately, SRE across the country is often weak. 
defaultThere is lots of evidence to substantiate this, but most recently in May 2013, an

defaultstatutory guidance on SRE, but equally there is a lack of accountability surrounding SRE and PSHE generally, highlighted by there being no set curriculum to deliver, and poor assessment (
