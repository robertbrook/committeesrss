[normal]Written evidence submitted by [bold]FPA and Brook [bold][OLS0066][bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]About FPA[bold]&#xa0;[bold]FPA is one of the UK’s leading sexual health charities. Our mission is to help establish a society in which everyone has positive, informed and non-judgmental attitudes to sex and relationships; where everyone can make informed choices about sex and reprod
[normal]uction so that they can enjoy sexual health free from prejudice or harm. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We do this through providing a comprehensive sexual health information service for professionals and the public, running community based sex and relationships education programmes a
[normal]nd campaigning to ensure that high quality sexual health information and services are available to all who need them.

[normal]About Br[bold]ook[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Brook is the UK’s leading provider of sexual health services and advice for young people under 25. Our mission is to ensure young people can enjoy their sexuality without harm.
[normal] [bold]Brook services provide free and confidential sexual health information, co
[normal]ntraception, pregnancy testing, advice and counselling, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections and outreach and education work, reaching over 290,000 young people every year. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Brook believes that every young person in Britain deserves 
[normal]sex and relationships education (SRE) that is relevant to them, focuses on relationships as well as sex, honest about human sexuality and taught by professionals who are well prepared and confident. Sex and relationships are a life skill, as important to o
[normal]ur future health and happiness as any other subject, and young people deserve to be heard.

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Summary[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Brook and FPA 
[normal]welcome the focus on pr
[normal]otecting young
[normal] people from harm. Young people are vulnerable from online environments in a number of ways, which are not just about access to pornography. These include grooming, bullying and exploitation, and it is important that this Inquiry does not seek to dispropor
[normal]tionately focus on pornography in comparison to these other important areas of consideration. Certainly,
[normal] we know that 
[normal]simply blocking internet content is not a cure-all
[normal], and the role of education 
[normal]in supporting young people’s safe navigation of the online e
[normal]nvironment 
[normal]is 
[normal]key
[normal]. 
[normal]Therefore we
[normal] strongly advise for the need to
[normal] talk about education for young people and support for parents at the same time.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In particular, w
[normal]e would be concerned if actions resulting from a review of filtering
[normal] meant that legitimate educ
[normal]atio
[normal]n websites
[normal] were blocked
[normal] as well.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In summary:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Brook’s young people’s response to [bold]this Inquiry[bold]&#xa0;[bold]To inform this response, Brook asked
[normal] groups of young people across the country to consider their views of the questions and th
[normal]emes raised in this Inquiry
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]These groups included young people who identified as LGB and T
[normal] (Lesbian, Gay Bisexual and Transgender)
[normal], male, female and non-binary, 
[normal]BME
[normal] (Black, Minority, 
[normal]Ethnic
[normal] communities)
[normal], experience of mental health, experience of homelessness, and as young offenders. A summary of their conclusions is provided here and a full copy of the report can be found in Annex A of this document.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Conclusio
[normal]ns from young people’s response
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“If young people want to access porn, out of arousal or curiosity, that's perfectly healthy and typical. However, easy access to porn needs to be supplemented with good sex education and lessons about internet awareness and
[normal] safety, as well as an open and non-judgemental societal attitude towards sex and sexuality.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](
[normal]anonymised
[normal] quote from young people’s response)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The feedback from the young people shows that, broadly speaking, 
[normal]it is clear that
[normal] young people need better, more
[normal] inclusive education on internet safety, both for children and for parents, 
[normal]not least 
[normal]to ensure that knowledge, skills and understanding around online safety are embedded in the next generation. This would support a societal shift in the bullying culture w
[normal]hich has developed around social media, without imposing enforced censorship which could inhibit young people’s ability to access accurate information about sex. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Compulsory education on internet safety, covering issues which include pornography and cyber
[normal] bullying, would allow young people to explore and understand their developing sexuality whilst reducing any risk of harm.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1. [bold]How best to protect minors from accessing adult content?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1 
[normal]In order to protect minors from accessing adult content 
[normal]we must provide young people with the support, education, skills and understan
[normal]ding to ensure that they
[normal] are not damaged by, pressured into or exploited through exposure to porn and that they are able t
[normal]o cope with the availability of pornography, on and offline. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2 
[normal]However, 
[normal]Brook and FPA do not believe that it is possible or right to simply prevent young people 
[normal]accessing pornography. 
[normal]We make a clear distinction between child abuse and pornography, and indeed censorship and protection. 
[normal]We 
[normal]also 
[normal]welcome
[normal] the focus 
[normal]of this Inquiry 
[normal]on protecting you
[normal]ng people from harm and condemn
[normal] all images of child abuse
[normal],
[normal] which are illegal. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3 
[normal]Brook’s re
[normal]search with
[normal] [bold]groups of young people suggests:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4 
[normal]In terms of how young people would like to better deal with 
[normal]pornography they may see, 
[normal]Brook and FPA recommend
[normal] an educational approach which helps young people to:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Parents
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5 
[normal]Brook and FPA 
[normal]believe
[normal] that parents should be better enabled and encouraged to
[normal] take responsibility for supervising their children and setting appropriate safety settings
[normal],
[normal] particularly
[normal] if they have young children who may be vulnerable
[normal] to seeing images that 
[normal]they 
[normal]might find
[normal] distressing. The young people 
[normal]we spoke with 
[normal]pointed out that there are existing safety settings which are very good 
[normal]filters
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]They felt that if safety settings are used appropriately then young people would not come across adult content when searching for 
[normal]something else.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“We don't need to create new 
[normal]filters,
[normal] we just need to educate parents about how to use existing safety settings.” 
[normal]Young woman, 16.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Educate the parents, who can in turn educate the children.” 
[normal]Young person, 18.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.6 
[normal]To enable parents to 
[normal]act accordingly, they suggested that education should be provided to parents so that they are able to understand and set parent
[normal]al controls. The young people that Brook
[normal] spoke to all knew how to 
[normal]set controls
[normal] themselves, describing the process as simple, and 
[normal]felt that 
[normal]with the right level of intervention and education from parents, 
[normal]there should be no reason why children should see adult content if they 
[normal]or their parents deem the material disturbing
[normal]. 
[normal]They suggested developing leaflets, posters or training/workshops for parents, explaining how simple it is to set these controls. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Educate parents on how young people access what they do and make it so that young people know that they can talk to their p
[normal]arents or someone they trust if they have seen something that makes them distressed.”
[normal] Young person, 20
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Individual guidance by parents to ensure children 
[normal]don't
[normal] find this material. If a parent is present, even if they do find it, it can be explained proper
[normal]ly, explained why it's wrong and why not to go back to the site.” 
[normal]Young person, 18.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.7 
[normal]Parenting support programmes such as the FPA’s Speakeasy
[normal] programme (see below) can help parents build up the knowledge and skills they need to enable them to discuss 
[normal]issues around sex, relationships and growing up with their children and teach them key skills in these areas. 
[normal]In turn, developing a stronger dialogue between parents and children can help build the co
[normal]nfidence of the children to
[normal] be more open with their pare
[normal]nts about what they may have seen.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Speakeasy
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.8 
[normal]Speakeasy
[normal] is a FPA course for parents and carers to better enable them to engage with the children for 
[normal]wh
[normal]ich
[normal] they are responsible, on
[normal] often tric
[normal]ky issues surrounding
[normal] sex and relationships. FPA knows that many parents and carers want to talk with their children about issues associated with growing up, including sex and relationships, but many are embarrassed or unsure about where to start and what to say. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.9 
[normal]FPA has
[normal] developed the Speakeasy programme to enable parents and carers to develop the skills, knowledge and confidence to have these sometimes difficult conversations. The community-based project runs over eight weeks and covers factual information including how 
[normal]to keep children and young people safe; the pressures young people may be under; and strategies for proactively starting 
[normal]discussions on growing up, sex and relationships. The course is accredited by the Open College Network, which gives parents the opportu
[normal]nity to receive credits for the work they do, which they can then apply in further learning or in employment. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.10 
[normal]Evaluations of the project have demonstrated the positive impact it has on parents’ knowledge, confidence and their relationships with thei
[normal]r children. A Social Return on Investment (SROI) analysis of the programme has estimated the total value of benefits to children and parents and to the state to be £21 million. The value to the state represents a return of £5.29 for every pound of public m
[normal]oney invested in the project. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Sex and Rela
[normal]t
[normal]ionships Education 
[normal](SRE) 
[normal]and the role of s
[normal]chools
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.11 
[normal]Brook and FPA believe that parents and 
[normal]carers
[normal] play a crucial role in giving information and advice to children and young people about sex, relationships and
[normal] growing up. However, a
[normal]lthough parents and 
[normal]carers
[normal] absolutely have a role to play in protecting minors from accessing potentially damaging online material, according to the National Association of Head Teachers, 83% of parents also had sufficient confidence
[normal] in schools' ability to help their children understand the dangers specifically associated with pornography, and that they believed teachers were as important as parents in handling the issue. Just 13% thought it should be left to parents alone to educate 
[normal]children about pornography (NAHT survey, May 2013)
[normal] 
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.12 
[normal]Indeed, Brook and FPA strongly believe SRE must cove
[normal]r many issues relating to this I
[normal]nquiry beyond porn, including 
[normal]sexting
[normal], making friends and relationships online, bullying, and safety in relationships. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.13 
[normal]In order to achieve this, 
[normal]Brook 
[normal]and 
[normal]FPA 
[normal]be
[normal]lieve that the best strategy
[normal] is a joint home-school programme between schools, parents 
[normal]and young people. 
[normal]We should also acknowledge that many parents, despite the
[normal]ir
[normal] best intentions, will still fee
[normal]l
[normal] too awkward to have conversation
[normal]s
[normal] about sex with their children. Furthermore, schools are widely
[normal] regarded as an 
[normal]appropriate and 
[normal]impartial ground 
[normal]for such discussions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.14 
[normal]This sentiment is supported by Brook’s discussion with young people who said that
[normal] internet safety should be 
[normal]taught in school, including about
[normal] how to set controls. Brook and FPA support the young people’s suggestion that educator
[normal]s could explain to children that there are images on the internet which may not be suitable, talk to them about what it means, and teach them how to avoid it. Furthermore, children should be taught that there are some things on the internet that they may f
[normal]ind disturbing and that there are 
[normal]people they can talk to if they do see something that upsets
[normal] them.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]I think education is more important than sheltering young people and just pretending they are not there, because they would no doubt find them anyway.”
[normal] 
[normal]Y
[normal]oung Person, 18.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Better education in schools. Explain to them that those films are not real, and are actors.”
[normal] 
[normal]Young person, 20.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“I think educating young people on the different types of images etc is also important to ensure that when they are faced with such things they know how to deal with them.” 
[normal]Young person, 23.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]SRE and the prevention of sexual abuse, sexual exploitation 
[normal]and domestic and sexual violence
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.15 
[normal]In its May 2013 report into PSHE, 
[normal]Ofsted
[normal] states that l
[normal]ack
[normal] of age-appropriate sex and relationships education may leave young people vulnerable to inappropriate sexual behaviours and sexual exploitation, particularly i
[normal]f they are not taught the appropriate language, or have not developed the confidence to describe unwanted behaviours, or do not know who to go to for help
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.16 
[normal]SRE can play a role in keeping children and young people safe. SRE aims to equip children and
[normal] young people with language and skills to understand appropriate and inappropriate 
[normal]behaviour
[normal], be able to resist pressure and to know who to talk to and how to access help and support when they need it.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.17 
[normal]Specifically
[normal] Brook 
[normal]and 
[normal]FPA believe that in the 
[normal]context of online safety, SRE could be used to teach young people as follows: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.18 
[normal]The backing for this is clear. In May 2013, a 
[normal]YouGov
[normal] opinion poll found that 86% of UK adults 
[normal]believe that sex and relationships education “which addresses sexual consent and respectful relationships” should be compulsory in secondary schools
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Fantasy 
[normal]vs
[normal] Reality course
[normal] and training resou
[normal]rc
[normal]e
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.18 
[normal]FPA has developed a course and booklet which su
[normal]pports teachers to deliver a series of lessons exploring the influence and impact of the media, the internet and pornography on the sexual attitudes and 
[normal]behaviour
[normal] of young people.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.19 
[normal]These resources help teachers to plan lessons on the very sensitive su
[normal]bject of the 
[normal]sexualisation
[normal] of young people, including the role of pornography. It also provides objective, safe and creative ways to tackle the issue.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.20 
[normal]These resources meet official guidance for students at Key stages 3 and 4 with, and include 
[normal]different lesson plans and training options for each stage. The booklet also includes a CD-ROM with video clips, images and PowerPoint presentations suitable for use with Key stage 3 and 4 students, and was produced by the Brighton &amp; Hove Healthy Schools T
[normal]eam and developed in partnership with 
[normal]PSHE (Personal, Social, Health and Economic) education teachers with guidance from the Metropolitan police and FPA staff.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Relationships, Safety and Risks booklet
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.21 
[normal]Brook has developed a booklet, which
[normal] offers ins
[normal]ight, signposting and support around the everyday risks young people face as they navigate the worlds of social media, the internet and their own social lives; at home, in education, and when out and about.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.22 
[normal]The booklet gives an overview of a wide 
[normal]range of potential issues; including “
[normal]sexting
[normal]”, sexual bullying, pornography and unhealthy relationships. Crucially, it offers relevant information and tips for staying safe as well as details of where young people can go if they need help, support and adv
[normal]ice.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.23 
[normal]Ask Brook about relationships, safety and risks
[normal] is a brand new addition to the pocket-sized A6 Ask Brook booklet range. It is aimed at 14+ young people and an extremely useful tool to all professionals working with youth groups and young people.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Updating current Government guidance re SRE
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.24 
[normal]Currently, maintained schools must have regard to the (as was) Department for Education and Employment’s, 
[normal]Sex and Relationship Education Guidance
[normal] 
[normal](2000). This guidance 
[normal]pre-dates the Sexual Offences Act 2003, the repeal of Section 28 of the Local Government Act and the 2010 Equalities legislation which includes the recommendation that schools teach gender equality and non-violent, respectful relationships between women an
[normal]d men.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] This current Government SRE guidance also pre-dates recent and emerging issues on technology and safeguarding, with no reference to addressing on-line safety, '
[normal]sexting
[normal]' or pornography in SRE. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.25 
[normal]Brook 
[normal]and 
[normal]FPA recommen
[normal]d that the Government shoul
[normal]d up
[normal]date SRE guidance for the modern era.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. How best to filter out extremist material, including images of child abuse and material intended to promote terrorism or other acts of violence?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]When children start to hit puberty
[normal],
[normal] then without places where they can talk about sex in a positive way (and not just mechanics) then they will go looking for potentially harmful images, and in the world we live in it is virtually impossible to censor those completely.”
[normal] 
[normal]Young person, 18.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1 
[normal]Any proposal to restrict young people’s access to extreme material online will be fraught with complication and difficult to implement. Filters must be sophisticated to allow for a range of factors (for example, households with children of different ag
[normal]es, and differing definitions of pornography). Part of supporting young people through education is ensuring they have access to good quality, factual information on sexual health online. Attempts to restrict young people’s access to pornography may inadve
[normal]rtently lead to the blocking of good quality education sites. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2 
[normal]Although y
[normal]oung people have told us that while they are concerned about pornography and would like help and support dealing with it, we must 
[normal]also 
[normal]acknowledge that a block can only go so far
[normal] and as discussed in our response to Question 1, we should ensure we 
[normal]promote the need for
[normal] education for young people and support for parents at the same time.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Defining ‘extremist’
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3 
[normal]Brook and FPA support the views of the young people interviewed by 
[normal]Brook
[normal] and that it is 
[normal]important to give consideration to what is deemed 
[normal]‘
[normal]extremist
[normal]’
[normal]. They were clear that images of child abuse or bestiality should be banned, but some felt that censoring images of bondage, for example, is wrong because acts of bondage may
[normal] be consensual. They were clear that there is a huge difference between sexual violence and consensual acts of bondage. There was also concern from young people who identify as LGB
[normal] and 
[normal]T that some of the porn they can relate to might be labeled as “extremi
[normal]st” whereas in fact porn involving
[normal], for example,
[normal] trans* individuals often reinforces their identity and sense of self, rather than being fetishistic. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Addressing the issue at the source
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4 
[normal]Some of the young people 
[normal]that Brook
[normal] spoke with 
[normal]also 
[normal]felt that 
[normal]responsibility should be placed on the websites which host extreme materials. Rather than being an issue of filters, the issue should be addressed at the source.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Surely the issue should be with the websites themselves existing, rather than blocking out young people's free will to surf the web. We should be tackling the websites themselves, rather than blocking access to them...” 
[normal]Young person, 20.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Make the promot
[normal]ion and creation of website such as these illegal and ensure that it's an offence that the police take active force to enforce.” 
[normal]Young person, 23.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5 
[normal]Furthermore, Brook 
[normal]and FPA 
[normal]would like to point out that although online pornography will almost always 
[normal]show consenting adults, it rarely shows that the consent leading to the actions being undertaken has been pre-discussed and negotiated. This leads to a perception that it is somehow acceptable to quickly engage in sexual acts that others may find extreme, 
[normal]without gaining the permission of all parties involved. Brook
[normal] and FPA 
[normal]recommend that the perception of 
[normal]this needs
[normal] to change, and 
[normal]the
[normal] Government 
[normal]should implement 
[normal]policy which leads to pornography websites showing the consent and negotiation that leads to the sexual acts which are shown. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. How best to prevent[bold] abusive or threatening comments on social media[bold]?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]“Educating young people about how some people on the i
[normal]nternet use anonymity and personas to try to hurt or control other people; and how to identify spaces in which they feel safe and unsafe so they can find spaces on the internet that suit them best. I would also foster a society in which people didn't feel 
[normal]they needed to use the internet (or anything else) to dominate others, but that would take a while.”
[normal] 
[normal]Young person, 24.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1 
[normal]Brook and FPA concur with the views of the young people interviewed by Brook that cyber bullying should not be looked at in isolatio
[normal]n, and that it is just one facet to the much wider issue of bullying generally. The solution is not as simple as increasing b
[normal]locking or reporting options. W
[normal]hat is
[normal] really
[normal] required is a societal shift in attitudes around respect and how we treat others. The media, in 
[normal]all its formats, has an important role to play in this shift
[normal], particularly in enforcing a message that there are no unhealthy sexual or societal norms that you
[normal]ng people should feel that they should have to live up to with regards to their sexuality and sexual 
[normal]behaviour
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Helping young people to understand abusive and threatening 
[normal]behaviour
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2 
[normal]Further to our response to Question 1, Brook 
[normal]and 
[normal]FPA 
[normal]firmly believe
[normal] that quality S
[normal]RE 
[normal]as part of PSHE should encompass education 
[normal]that helps
[normal] 
[normal]pupils
[normal] understand why people bully
[normal], and to teach them
[normal] to react in a way that is both responsible and appropriate to their individual circumstances. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Teach the children to be 
[normal]understanding of the harsh semiotics of the internet, and how to be emotionally resilient and secure.”
[normal] 
[normal]Young person, 18.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“You need to teach children to take advantage of the ability to block people on websites and use high privacy settings.”
[normal] 
[normal]Young person,
[normal] 18.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3 
[normal]The young people that Brook
[normal] spoke with also
[normal] suggested targeting the bullies or potential bullies and increasing understanding of power dynamics through education. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“If you want to solve society's problems, you need to start at the source.” 
[normal]Young person, 16.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Education is 
[normal]key
[normal]. Having the appropriate education at school will help people 
[normal]realise
[normal] that being a keyboard warrior is not constructive.”
[normal] 
[normal]Young person, 20.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4 
[normal]As mentioned in our response to Question 1 under the ‘SRE and the preventio
[normal]n of sexual abuse, sexual exploitation and domestic and sexual violence’ section, teaching about abuse 
[normal]has the potential to help both 
[normal]the perpetrators and potential victims of bullying and abuse
[normal]. Brook and FPA 
[normal]strongly recommend the need for quality SRE as
[normal] part of PSHE education to be fully implemented across all school settings
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The need for a transparent internet culture
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5 
[normal]The young people that Brook spoke with,
[normal] described some innovative ideas about having more transparent internet culture, where websites should have clear terms of reference, including whether
[normal] the website allows free speech, which some people may find offensive. Where ‘free speech which some peop
[normal]le may find offensive’ is endorsed,
[normal] 
[normal]users of these websites
[normal] should therefore
[normal] be prepared for the fact that
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]others can say what they like; or whether it is a friendly and respectful community, where people will be removed if they post something th
[normal]at is offe
[normal]nsive. The obvious benefit of implementing such a system is that
[normal] young people would be enabled to exercise choice over what type of online community they choose to be part of.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6 
[normal]The
[normal] young people also highlighted the importance of social media sites developing smooth mechanisms to ensure that trolls are dealt with quickly and appropriately. One young person suggested that in addition to trolls being blocked from social media sites whe
[normal]re they demonstrate 
[normal]abusive 
[normal]behaviour
[normal],
[normal] large fines
[normal] could also
[normal] be introduced in order
[normal] to reinforce the anti-bullying commitment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Introduction of a procedure allowing anonymous trolls/abusers to be reported to either the website administration or the polic
[normal]e.”
[normal] 
[normal]Young person, 18.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Sufficient justice for trolls, better functioning 'flagging' on social media sites”.
[normal] 
[normal]Young man, 20.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.7 
[normal]In addition to the need to report trolls and bullies, s
[normal]ome young people 
[normal]that Brook spoke with 
[normal]also felt 
[normal]that more could be done to support children who do find dis
[normal]tressing or extremist images on
[normal]line, and one particularly helpful idea was to enact a help/ 
[normal]whistleblowing
[normal] button on websites so that children can be immediately directed to reputable professional

[normal] of aspects of online safety that are currently raising concerns, in particular:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Brook will be submitting a written response to 
[normal]the inquiry where we will
[normal] pull together recent policy and lines on the issue. Young people’s views will form a key element of this
[normal] response.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Method[bold]In order to ensure that young people’s views were accurately represented in Brook’s response to the CMS inquiry, the Participation Lead created an online survey, which was promoted via our 
[normal]BeSexPositive
[normal] social media channels, and
[normal] asked groups of young people across the country to consider their views of the questions and themes raised in this Inquiry. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]These groups included young people who identified as LGB and T (Lesbian, Gay Bisexual and Transgender), male, female and non-bina
[normal]ry, BME
[normal] (Black, Minority, 
[normal]Ethnic
[normal] communities)
[normal], experience of mental health, experience of homelessness, and as young offenders. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Findings[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Question 1) [bold]Some[bold] internet sites, for example those that show graphic images of sexual violence, are [bold]usually considered as inappropriate for young people under the age of 18. What do you think are the best ways to protect children, or younger young people, from accessing images that they might find distressing?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The young people were really clear that the
[normal]re needs to be a distinction between protection and censorship. They felt it was important to 
[normal]recognise
[normal] the fact that some young people will be purposefully seeking out porn for a variety of reasons, including being intrigued about sex. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]They felt that pa
[normal]rents need to take responsibility for supervising their children and setting appropriate safety settings if they have young children who may be vulnerable to seeing images that they might find distressing. The young people pointed out that there are existi
[normal]ng safety settings which are very good 
[normal]filters
[normal]. They felt that if safety settings are used appropriately then young people would not come across adult content when searching for something else.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Educate the parents, who can in turn educate the children.” 
[normal]Young person, 18.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To enable parents to act accordingly, they suggested that education should be provided to parents so that they are able to understand and set parental controls. The young people we spoke to all knew how to do this themselves, describing 
[normal]the process as simple, and felt that there should be no reason why children should see adult content if they don't want to. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“We don't need to create new 
[normal]filters,
[normal] we just need to educate parents about how to use existing safety settings.” 
[normal]Young woman, 16.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]They suggested developing leaflets, posters or training/workshops for parents, explaining how simple it is to set these controls. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“I think to help keep children from accessing images which may cause distress, parents and 
[normal]carers
[normal] need to take responsibil
[normal]ity to discuss these subjects with their children and as well as the need to make sure these kind of sites are not accessible if they have children under 18.”
[normal] 
[normal]Young person, 15.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]They also felt strongly that young people should be taught about internet safe
[normal]ty in school and taught how to set controls themselves. They suggested that educators could explain to children that there are image on the internet which may not be suitable, talk to them about what it means, and teach them how to avoid it. They thought t
[normal]hat children should be taught that there are some things on the internet that they may find disturbing and that there are people they can talk to, if they do see something that upsets them.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]I think education is more important than sheltering young people
[normal] and just pretending they are not there, because they would no doubt find them anyway.”
[normal] 
[normal]Young Person, 18.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Better education in schools. Explain to them that those films are not real, and are actors.”
[normal] 
[normal]Young person, 20.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Making young people and parents awa
[normal]re of how to block distressing images and educating children and younger young people about who to speak to if they come across something they find upsetting.”
[normal] 
[normal]Young person, 24.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Educate parents on how young people access what they do and make it so that 
[normal]young people know that they can talk to their parents or someone they trust if they have seen something that makes them distressed.”
[normal] Young person, 20
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“I think educating young people on the different types of images etc is also important to ensure that whe
[normal]n they are faced with such things they know how to deal with them.” 
[normal]Young person, 23.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Some young people also gave suggestions about how safeguards could be improved to ensure that children are not able to access adult content.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Require date of birth conf
[normal]irmation before entering, have captions preceding these images warning of graphic content.” 
[normal]Young person
[normal], 
[normal]21.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Ensuring that 
[normal]there's better parental controls
[normal], rather than just having to click a button to say you are over the age, instead asking the parent
[normal] to enter the password. I also think that there should be better control over sites use of pop-ups and advertising on other websites that are harmless and have nothing to do with porn.” 
[normal]Young person, 23.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Question 2) What ways do you think would be best t[bold]o protect children and young people from extremist material, such as images of child abuse and sites that promote terrorism or other acts of violence?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]First of all, the young people thought it was important to give consideration to what is considered extremist. They were clear that images of child abuse or bestiality should be banned, but some felt that censoring images of bondage, for example, is wrong 
[normal]because it may be consensual. They were clear that there is a huge difference between sexual violence and consensual acts of bondage. There was also concern from young people who identify as LGBT that porn that they can relate to might be 
[normal]labelled
[normal] as “extr
[normal]emist” whereas in fact porn involving trans* individuals often reinforces their identity and sense of self, rather than being fetishistic. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Again, the young people highlighted the importance of open and honest discussion, and comprehensive education, to i
[normal]nform children of the dangers of accessing certain sites, and the importance of education for parents to enable them to have those potentially difficult discussions, whilst also learning about how to use appropriate parental controls. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]“I believe [that th
[normal]e way] to truly protect children from extremist material... is [by having] positive shared discussion, with family, 
[normal]carers
[normal] or teachers when possible, about the subjects.”
[normal] 
[normal]Young person, 15.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Individual guidance by parents to ensure children 
[normal]don't
[normal] find this
[normal] material. If a parent is present, even if they do find it, it can be explained properly, explained why it's wrong and why not to go back to the site.” 
[normal]Young person, 18.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Some of the young people also felt that responsibility should be placed on the websit
[normal]es which host extremist materials. Rather than being an issue of filters, the issue should be addressed at the source.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Surely the issue should be with the websites themselves existing, rather than blocking out young people's free will to surf the web. We should be tackling the websites themselves, rather than blocking access to them...” 
[normal]Young person, 20.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Make the promot
[normal]ion and creation of website such as these illegal and ensure that it's an offence that the police take active force to enforce.” 
[normal]Young person, 23.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Some young people also felt that more could be done to support children who do find distressing or extremis
[normal]t images on line.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Have a number/email/button that they can get in contact with so that if the see something inappropriate they can tell someone with influence who can do the right thing and reassure the young person.”
[normal] 
[normal]Young person, 20.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Question 3) [bold]What[bold] do you think are the best ways that young people can be kept safe from abusive or threatening comments on social media? If you were in charge, how would you deal with internet trolls?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]There was a strong focus from young people that cyber bullying should 
[normal]not be looked at in isolation, and that it is just one facet to the much wider issue of bullying generally. 
[normal]They felt that the 
[normal]solution is not as simple as increasing blocking or reporting options, and that what is required is a societal shift in attitudes
[normal] around respect and how we treat others.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]They suggested that all children and young people should receive education about relationships so that they can understand bullying and why people bully. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Teach the children to be understanding of the harsh semio
[normal]tics of the internet, and how to be emotionally resilient and secure.”
[normal] 
[normal]Young person, 18.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“You need to teach children to take advantage of the ability to block people on websites and use high privacy settings.”
[normal] 
[normal]Young person, 18.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]They suggested targeting t
[normal]he bullies or potential bullies and increasing understanding of power dynamics through education. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“If you want to solve society's problems, you need to start at the source.” 
[normal]Young person, 16.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Education is 
[normal]key
[normal]. Having the appropriate education at 
[normal]school will help people 
[normal]realise
[normal] that being a keyboard warrior is not constructive.”
[normal] 
[normal]Young person, 20.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]They also described some innovative ideas about having more transparent internet culture, where websites should have clear terms of reference, including 
[normal]whether the website allows free speech, and therefore people need to be prepared for the fact that
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]others can say what they like; or whether it is a friendly and respectful community, where people will be removed if they post something that is offensive. T
[normal]hen young people would be enabled to exercise choice over what type of online community they choose to be part of.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Educating young people about how some people on the internet use anonymity and personas to try to hurt or control other people; and how to 
[normal]identify spaces in which they feel safe and unsafe so they can find spaces on the internet that suit them best. I would also foster a society in which people didn't feel they needed to use the internet (or anything else) to dominate others, but that would 
[normal]take a while.”
[normal] 
[normal]Young person, 24.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]They young people also highlighted the importance of social media sites developing smooth mechanisms to ensure that trolls are dealt with quickly and appropriately. One young person suggested that in addition to trolls bei
[normal]ng blocked from social media sites where they demonstrate abusive 
[normal]behaviour
[normal], they could also impose 
[normal]“large fines!”
[normal] to reinforce the anti-bullying commitment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Introduction of a procedure allowing anonymous trolls/abusers to be reported to either the websi
[normal]te administration or the police.”
[normal] 
[normal]Young person, 18.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Sufficient justice for trolls, better functioning 'flagging' on social media sites”.
[normal] 
[normal]Young man, 20.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Question 4) The Government is worried that children and young people can find porn too easily. What [bold]do you think? And if you were Prime Minister what would you do?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]“I believe if the Government 
[normal]feel
[normal] the porn is too accessible and want to ensure young people don't see it, they should improve the sex education in schools. As porn is usually viewed by young
[normal] people who are not entirely sure or can't understand sex, are intrigued to see what people do when they have sex (as this is not the kind of information we find out in sex education, we tend to only get the "mate and 
[normal]fertilisation
[normal]" and how to avoid becomi
[normal]ng pregnant) especially LGBT youth. If I was prime minister I would insist more in depth sex education and awareness about LGBT sexual relationships.”
[normal] 
[normal]Young person, 15.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“I think it is more to do with education, I accessed pornographic images from the age o
[normal]f 11 and this was a lot to do with my own questions about my body and sexuality, but I was never given any outlet or information about these images, it was just not talked about at all throughout education[...] When children start to hit puberty then witho
[normal]ut places where they can talk about sex in a positive way (and not just mechanics) then they will go looking for potentially harmful images, and in the world we live in it is virtually impossible to censor those completely.”
[normal] 
[normal]Young person, 18.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Mandatory r
[normal]elationship education that rolls on into sex education from a VERY young age.”
[normal] 
[normal]Young person, 18.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Porn is not always a negative thing. Masturbation feels good; I enjoy watching porn when I masturbate... who are the government to intervene? If the 
[normal]government continues to speak about porn in this way it's steering us away from the goal of sex being more openly discussed in society. Look at the media...all of these over 
[normal]sexualised
[normal] adverts and graphic scenes in films - blocking porn sites is a waste of
[normal] time, instead they should be regulated; and young people should learn more about porn in schools.”
[normal] 
[normal]Young person, 20.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“If young people want to access porn, out of arousal or curiosity, that's perfectly healthy and typical. However, easy access to porn nee
[normal]ds to be supplemented with good sex education and lessons about internet awareness and safety, as well as an open and non-
[normal]judgemental
[normal] societal attitude towards sex and sexuality.”
[normal] 
[normal]Young person, 24.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“I think there is imagery that could be considered pornog
[normal]raphic everywhere (advertising, newsagents, etc) I think that the focus should be on educating children and young people about sex and parents essentially doing their job of parenting.”
[normal] 
[normal]Young person, 21.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Enforce education. The sex 
[normal]ed
[normal] bill hasn't been upd
[normal]ated since 2000, predating all internet issues. This would be a cause for outrage in any other subject.”
[normal] Young man, 20.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“I would leave the porn industry as is. They already have age warnings on 
[normal]websites,
[normal] many programs can be installed by parents that auto
[normal]matically block these websites (without infringing on adults and young people exploring their sexuality). Porn is 
[normal]labelled
[normal] as 18+, but it's undeniable that many teens watch porn and watch it safely. For many people it's a major way of exploring their sexua
[normal]lity, being sexually satisfied and learning about themselves in a safe environment with no chance of disease and if they find a problem they just need to hit the close button.” 
[normal]Young person, 18.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“I think that it's more important that young people receive 
[normal]better sex and relationship education in school to ensure that they are appropriately informed that porn is not reality and to help them understand what real sex and relationships look like.”
[normal] 
[normal]Young person, 23.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Conclusion[bold]In conclusion, it is clear that the young people we spoke to demand better, more inclusive education on internet safety, both for children and for parents, to ensure that knowledge, skills and understanding around online safety are embedded in the next gen
[normal]eration. This would support a societal shift in the bullying culture which has developed around social media, without imposing enforced censorship which could inhibit young people’s ability to access accurate information about sex. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Compulsory education o
[normal]n internet safety, covering issues which include pornography and cyber bullying, would allow young people to explore and understand their developing sexuality whilst reducing any risk of harm.

[normal] Unfortunately, SRE across the country is often weak. 
[normal]There is lots of evidence to substantiate this, but most recently in May 2013, an 
[normal]Ofsted
[normal] report found that 
[normal]schools are failing children and young people by not meeting the set 
[normal]statutory guidance on SRE, but equally there is a lack of accountability surrounding SRE and PSHE generally, highlighted by there being no set curriculum to deliver, and poor assessment (
