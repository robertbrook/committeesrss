[[[British Psychological Society ]]]

[[[(WSC067) ]]]&#xa0;The British Psychological Society, incorporated by Royal Charter, is the learned and professional body for psychology and psychologists in the United Kingdom. We are a registered charity with a total membership of just over 50,000.&#xa0;Under its Royal Charter, the objective of the British Psychological Society is "to promote the advancement and diffusion of the knowledge of psychology pure and applied and especially to promote the efficiency and usefulness of members by setting up a high standard of professional education and knowledge".  We are committed to providing and disseminating evidence-based expertise and advice, engaging with policy and decision makers, and promoting the highest standards in learning and teaching, professional practice and research.&#xa0;The British Psychological Society is an examining body granting certificates and diplomas in specialist areas of professional applied psychology.&#xa0;

[[[Response]]]This response was prepared for the British Psychological Society by the Research Board and the Psychology Education Board:&#xa0;&#xa0;2.2  In psychology, as with the humanities, there is a leaky pipeline but it occurs later on than in the harder STEM subjects where it is more a matter of moving women from PhD to postdoc to lectureship. 2.3 In psychology it operates differently. Nearly all of our undergraduates are female yet that only equates to an average 50/50 split at lecturer/senior lecturer levels and then women are again under-represented at the higher levels. In what is a female dominated subject, this gender discrepancy at the higher levels in troubling. It simply becomes harder for women to be promoted there. Some of this can be argued to be due to family policies whereby women pay the 'mommy penalty'. However, studies have demonstrated that this doesn't explain it all satisfactorily. 2.4 Several reasons ranging from decisions about childcare to bias. However, it would be a mistake to decide that interventions at the top of companies/universities will affect attitudes about gender and science. Beliefs about what is/isn’t a possible or suitable career for boys and girls are set in mid-childhood (around 8-10 years).2.4 The Athena SWAN scheme and the extended ECU will start to uncover some of these problems across institutions by asking institutions to disclose information on application, recruitment and staffing at all levels.  We are aware that a number of Departments of Psychology have Athena Swan awards and provide a useful network for data-gathering on differing practices. However, how the institutions choose to act on this becomes a different matter. Tying it to real consequences is one step in the right direction but we need further moves to ensure that women are represented at senior levels.3.                When women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? What are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in different employment sectors?3.1 Our Careers Destinations project (January 2013 report) has shown that Psychology graduates transition into a wide variety of STEM and non-STEM careers.  Some will go on to become qualified psychologists; others will go into different career areas (such as the police, armed forces, employment and selection, as well as other areas of employment in which advanced research skills are required – such as the food and drink or pharmaceutical industries).  We believe that this wide transferability of skills obtained from studying psychology is one of the reasons why it is so popular and why its popularity continues to grow. 3.2 An undergraduate degree in psychology provides graduates with hugely transferrable skills as well as those in psychological literacy.  For example, in terms of the employability skills acquired during a psychology degree, our own research has shown that  self management, team-working, problem solving, communication and literacy, application of numeracy, application of information technology were well developed.  In relation to “psychological skills”, a basic knowledge of the critical subject matter of psychology, scientific and critical analysis/problem solving, applying psychological knowledge to work, relationships and the broader community, behaving ethically, recognising, understanding and fostering respect for diversity, and being insightful and reflective about one’s own and others’ behaviour and mental processes were also well developed .3.3 We therefore welcome and support the usage of these skills in different employment sectors both within and beyond STEM.4.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We would anticipate that those Departments and Institutions that are Athena Swan award recipients will be able to provide the strongest examples of best practice. 4.2 Harriet Tenenbaum and Patrick Leman at the University of Surrey have just completed a project on mentoring undergraduate women in science which has demonstrable positive effects both in terms of academic performance and intentions to pursue careers in science. The outcomes of this research are also applicable to those further along in their academic careers.&#xa0;5.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It should have a facilitatory role. Importantly, it needs to fund research into the early causes of beliefs about gender and science. The focus on addressing inequalities in post is worthwhile in the short and medium term. But role model women in these areas will not generate a lasting move towards equality if, at school and through childhood, the sense in which some aspects of science are a male domain, becomes ingrained.&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
