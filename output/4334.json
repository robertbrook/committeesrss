"&#xa0;\nAdditional written evidence from the Open Data User Group (ODUG) [OD 29]&#xa0;\nIntroduction\nThe Open Data User Group\n (ODUG)\n welcomes this opportunity to provide additional evidence to the \ni\nnquiry \non statistics and open data \nand to clarify certain points in the light of \nthe ora\nl evidence\n given to-date\n, \nin particular that provided by M\ninisters from BIS\n and \nthe Cabinet Office and the National Statistician\n.\nODUG is impressed by the breadth and d\nepth of the \ninquiry\n. Informed questioning from the committee is bringing to light a range of \ncontradictions in government policy which need to \nbe \nresolved if open d\nata is to contribute fully to the accountability, choice and growth agendas as laid out in t\nhe Open Data White Paper\n.\nIn this additional evidence we will outline a number of principles that have been raised by and with the committee. We will also provide short case studies that illustrate these \nprinciples\n and other relevant documents as appendic\nes to this evidence.\nIssues raised as a result of evidence given to the committee\nA number of witnesses \nreferred to the National Information Infrastructure\n (NII)\n as proposed in the Shakespeare Review\n. ODUG welcomes the strong encouragement for government departments to choose their “most important” datasets and to ensure that those are made available under the Open Government Licence (OGL) as open data.\nHowever, \nit is our view that \nthe \ncurrently selected \ndepartment data sets will not necessarily provide a coherent “infrastructure”.\n Also, w\nhil\nst\n the number of data sets released by particular departments may be a useful indicator of that department’s commitment to t\nhe open data agenda, data sets that have been held back, for reasons other than the protection of personal data, may be a better indicator of a lack of commitment, for whatever reason, to open data.\nODUG also believes that not all data sets are of equal im\nportance. In our view the term “\ncore \nreference\n data\n” should be reserved for data sets which are the primary source of an identifier such as a VAT number, a Company Number, a Unique Property Reference Number (UPRN), a Postcode or a code used to identify a s\ntatistical or administrative area.\nSuch \ncore \nreference \ndata is essential to allow \nother \ndata sets to be linked and to check the quality of data. This point was well made by Jil Matheson, the National Statistician, in relation to the National Address Regist\ner. Th\nis is a particularly important \ncore reference data \nset\n which we discuss\n, as a case study, in Appendix 1\n. Its \nspecial\n importance was also noted in the Open Data White Paper\n1\n which included\n a commitment to resolve the issue of national address data.\nTh\ne Office for National Statistics has a very good reco\nrd of releasing core reference data\n relating to statistical or administrative areas as open data. These include the ONS Standard Names And Codes (SNAC) database and the ONS Postcode Directory \n(\ns\nee Append\nix 3) \nwhich has only relatively recently \nbecome available as Open Data because it was previously kept closed under the commercial GridLink agreement between ONS, Royal Mail and Ordnance Survey\n (OS)\n. \nT\nhe ONS Postcode \ndirectory, while very useful\n,\n only prov\nides Postcode\ns\n to administrative and statistical area conversions \nand \ndoes not list individual addresses (postcodes on average refer to about 14 addresses).\nWhere core reference data is not made available this may prevent the release of other data sets as \nopen data in a usable form\n or the ability to derive the maximum benefit from datasets which are made open\n. Many of the requests for open data on data.gov.uk are for addressed lists of particular types of facilities, such as schools or libraries, or for dat\na about properties such as Energy Performance Certificate Data. An \nO\npen National Address \nR\negister would ensure that all such data sets could be referenced using a Unique Property Reference Number from which a correct administrative or postal address could \nbe established. Without access to an \nO\npen National Address Register either such data isn’t published, or it is published with non-standard addresses making it difficult to match to \nand combine with \nother data sets.\nODUG notes that the term Nati\nonal \nInformation Infrastructure\n \nmight imply that a new “infrastructure” needs to be built. We believe that much of the infrastructure and much of the data that could and should be released as open data already exist\ns\n. We concur with APPSI (the Advisory Panel on\n Public Sector Information\n)\n, who raised many of the issues associated with making the National Information Infrastructure work in their October 2012 Discussion Paper on a National Information Framework\n.\nODUG believes that the data.gov.uk data request form\ns submitted by the public provide an equal, or more valid measure of what should constitute either “core data”, or “core \nreference\n data” in a National Information Infrastructure\n, rather\n than the data sets offered by departments.\n We also question the criter\nia by which departments have been asked to identify their data inventories for the NII, and suspect that there are many useful datasets which are not, as yet, part of the NII.\nHowever, g\niven that departments are \nnow \nstrongly encouraged to provide an invent\nory of unpublished data sets we believe that \nimmediate \neffort is best expended on releasing that data which has been requested, \nor identified in the NII, with a focus on the data requested as this \ncan be expected to be put to immediate beneficial use, \nrath\ner than trying to release all data particularly where data has to be documented or refined for release. ODUG can, and does, assist in the assessment and interpretation of open data \nrequests and the prioritisation of further datasets identified in the NII.\n&#xa0;\nDespite \na government commitment to open policy making ODUG has noticed a marked disparity between the openness of \nthe \ndecisions\n made\n to open datasets \nwith \nthe requirement to make business cases for \nreleasing\n data\n and the closed\n, often\n unaccountable\n,\n process\n associated with decisions not to release data, or\n only\n to make data \navailable under a commercial license.\nSeveral \nexamples characterise the problem. One was the decision to privatise the Royal Mail Postcod\ne Address File\n (PAF)\n (see Appendix 2)\n. \nThe case for opening PAF was made publicly, while the advice that led to the decision to sell PAF with \nthe \nRoyal Mail was largely opaque or incomplete. For \nexample Ofcom’s \n2013 \nconsultation on PAF was redacted to the \npoint of being quite useless in assessing whether the price charged for PAF is ‘reasonable’, as required by the Posta\nl\n Services Acts (\nan example of \nthe\n redaction\n in the Ofcom consultation \nis provided in \nAppendix \n6).\nEqually, d\nespite substantial lobbying fr\nom many sources\n, over many years,\n to establish an \nO\npen National Address Register the Government’s decision\n, in \n2010 \nto set up GeoPlace LLP a limited liability partnership between Ordnance Survey\n \nand \nthe Local G\novernment Association\n (LGA) \nwas presented as a\n simple unjustified announcement. GeoPlace\n’\ns corporate structure is one chosen by many Private Equity companies because it allows the financial dealings of the company to be priva\nte. The annual statement of GeoP\nlace LLP\n \ncontains no financial information o\nther than the three main sources of revenue\n and the anticipation that GeoP\nlace will produce a surplus which will be returned to OS and the LGA.\nA final example of closed policy making, which is still under consideration, concerns the obstruction of Her Maj\nesty’s Land Registry open data programme. HMLR are obliged, under the European INSPIRE legislation\n,\n as transposed into UK law, to make a cadastral (property ownership parcel) dataset publicly available. HMLR \nare\n inclined, in line with their exemplary open \ndata policies on house price data, to make the outlines of the land parcels openly available for general re-use\n, and have released this data\n as open data. However the\n open use of the data \nis \nbeing \nimpeded by \nthe \nOrdnance Survey who claim that the land parc\nels are \nOS \n‘derived data’ and any commercial re-use \nwill involve a d\nata royalty \npaid directly \nto \nthe \nOrdnance Survey, despite the fact that OS neither \nowns, maintains \nor delivers this data\n (Appendix 4)\n.\nThe \nrationale for the Ordnance Survey’s stance and th\ne level of royalty payments has\n been extraordinarily hard to ascertain and, as a result, the HMLR data is still not available for \nopen \nre-use. A publicly owned company KentGIS, \nwhich should have access to the \nINSPIRE cadastral \ndata under the Public Sector \nMapping Agreement (PSMA)\n,\n \nfunded by the government\n, \nrecently \ncreated a useful display service for the data which\n \nallowed the public to view Land Parcels\n nationally, for free. However this service has recently been\n closed down following a protest from Ordna\nnce Survey.\n So, despite the best efforts of HMLR, the INSPIRE data is not open for either public or private sector use and re-use.\nThere are many more examples where a government department or agency decides not to make publicly funded data openly availabl\ne for viewing and re-use\n. \nODUG, on behalf of data consumers, is working to make the case that certain individual datasets of high potential value to the wider economy should be made open. However, despite the presumption that public data should be made ope\nn\n, as the c\nommittee has noted, there is no-\none in government, outside the Cabinet Office, to ensure that open data policies \nare enforced and\n littl\ne consistency across government around the decision-making process for opening up data.\n&#xa0;\nNormally \ngovernment open data is public sector information which is necessary in order to perform a specific public task. Such data has been fully funded by the budget for that task and can be released as open \ndata\n at a marginal cost which in an Internet environment is likely to be close to zero.\n The cost \nof the\n release of such data can usually be absorbed into the public task budget that led to the data being created and maintained. \nMore problematic is data wh\nich is not associated with any one specific public task but is used widely across government. Such data includes statistical information and geospatial information. Following the Rayner review which started in 1979 and reported in 1982 an internal market w\nas created for statistical and geospatial information. \nGovernment departments were expected to pay for such information and to act as intelligent customers. In the case of statistical information, the job of re-selling the information, in particular Censu\ns information\n,\n was given to private, for\n-\nprofit census agencies, which paid an annual lice\nnce fee for the privilege of \nselling census data. This led to a situation where some government agencies found Census data too expensive to use. Ordnance Survey also \nmoved, more successfully, into cost recovery trading and successfully recovered a larger proportion of its costs than the statistical service.\nAround 2000 a review of Crown Copyright data was carried out \nwhich found\n that the statistical service was recover\ning a \nvery \nlow proportion of its costs, while government departments were being deprived of access to necessary statistical information. Statistical information \nthen \ncame out of the cost recovery / tradable information regime and effectively became open da\nta. Since that time the usage, the variety and the quality of statistical information has increased markedly.\nAt about the same time the Ordnance Survey was confirmed as a trading fund and was expected to move towards 100% cost recovery and now returns a s\nignificant surplus to the \nTreasury. However much of this cost recovery and surplus\n is illusory because Ordnance Survey earns a relatively low proportion of its revenue from the private sector. The bulk of its revenue comes from \ngovernment \npayments for the \nPublic Sector Mapping Agreement \n(PSMA) \nand for Ordnance Survey Open Data.\nIn the same way that some Government departments could not afford to buy statistical information when the cost recovery regime was in place, prior to the Public Sector Mapping Agreem\nent, departments, including ONS, could not afford access to all the Ordnance Survey Data that they could, or should have used.\nA\n significant amount of \nOrdnance Survey’s \nsupposedly private sector revenue is actually derived from quasi-private bodies such as\n not\n-\nfor\n-\nprofit Housing Associations, the utilities and from the sale of maps for planning applications for which there is little or no competition and which generate disproportionately large revenues for Ordnance Survey and their re-seller partners. All o\nf these \nsupposed trading revenues are high surplus monopoly rents, which are effectively a tax on data use \nrather \nthan no\nrmal competitive market profits. It is important also, to put th\ne surplus OS returns to the treasury\n into the context of the very subst\nantial market for geospatial information in which \nit\n operates which is estimated to be worth £bns a year. Despite their monopoly position OS captures very little \nvalue from the overall \nmarket. ODUG believes that\n this is a growth opportunity for the UK and\n,\n were OS to open up its data, there would be substantial opportunities for private companies in this sector\n. We believe that the OS should be funded by government to perform its important public task, as the National Mapping Agency, but that the commercial\nisation of this data, and the many derivative products and services it can drive is best left to the private sector. \nAn alternat\ne regime for recovering\n the costs of\n currently charged for government information, mainly from the trading funds\n,\n could be base\nd on charging those who cause core reference information to change, rather than those who seek to use it. This is the model that allows Land Registry and Companies House to release significant and increasing parts of their data holdings as open data.\n&#xa0;\nOpen data is justified in the Open Data White Paper because of the impact it has on Transparency, Efficiency, Accountability, Citizen \nC\nhoice and Economic Growth. Yet much of the argument and most of the business cases demanded for open data \nhave to be centred on evidenced economic growth. This is difficult to prove as projections are inevitably conjectural\n and it is very difficult\n, if not impossible, to\n identify the enterprises that will grow as a result of \nan \nopen data release.\nHowever a rec\nent article in the Financial Pages of the New Yorker has been widely acclaimed as explaining why crude attempts to measure the impact of open data on GDP may be incorrect (Appendix 7 – Gross Domestic Freebie). \nWitnesses and some members of the committee a\nppeared to believe that an important reason for not releasing open data is that it gives large multinational corporations (such as Google and Microsoft for example) a free ride and that they should not be let off from paying a fair price for the informatio\nn infrastructure that they use. However this ignores the fact that most of them are choosing not to licence or pay for government information at present. The effect of charging for data doesn’t impact on the multinationals at all, \nas the amounts they are c\nharged have no material impact on their bottom line. However, charging for the data\n prevent\ns\n the societal benefits that would accrue to all citizen\ns\n from easier free access to data as well as the Small and Medium businesses that would generate new products\n and services on the back of open data\n, unencumbered by complex and costly licensing regimes.\nCharging for data, rather than bringing in addition revenue from large wealthy corporations, limits use of the data to medium sized companies. What is worse is th\nat the revenue isn’t being used to maintain the data itself, which is a relatively inexpensive process. It is being used to maintain the bloated sales, marketing, and administrative structures necessary to protect the intellectual property rights of the or\nganisations that are keeping the data closed.\nIn his evidence to the inquiry the Minister of State for Business and Energy stated that the he was seeking ways to differentiate the costs of charged for public data for small businesses. ODUG does not think i\nt is possible to implement a differentiated pricing regime as suggested under the existing Information Fair Trader Scheme\n and EU State Aid rules\n. Equally the burden of putting in place such complex licensing regimes has already been noted as an inefficie\nncy in itself and as significant burden on small businesses. \nWe believe that current levels of government expenditure on government produced public sector information, are \nalready \nsufficient to release that information as open data. Charging regimes \nfund \nan\n army of data use preventers creating jobs inventing pricing and licensing schemes which are unnecessary. As an example we illustrate this effect for the Royal Mail Postcode Address File (PAF)  in Appendix 2, though we are limited in the extent to which \nwe can do so because of the secrecy that has surrounded the real cost of the PAF.\nSocietal benefit\n accrues when data is used. T\nhe New Yorker article \nreports\n massive, though unmeasured, societal benefits accrue to all of those consuming ‘Free’\n services from\n c\norporations such as Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Yahoo and Apple.  Of course each of these \nbusinesses \nhas alternative sources of revenue which fund their ‘free’ data and ‘free’ services. However, as this business model now dominates and consumers/citizen\ns\n are used to consuming and using data at no \ncost, but paying for the services in another way, it is counter-productive for a small number of government, or recently privatised\n,\n agencies to swim against this tide\n.\n&#xa0;\nConclusionA number of previous select com\nmittees, and government advisers such as Sir Michael Scholar then Chair of the Statistics Authorities (see letter in Appendix 5) who have consistently called for an open data mechanism to maximise the beneficial use of public sector data.\nThese requests pr\noposals and comments have consistently been ignored in order to chase the illusory revenues, which have never been delivered\n to their full potential\n, from closed data regimes.\nThe UK\n’\ns leading role in the Open Government Partnership and the rapid move towa\nrds open public data in Europe and the US, which in turn is leading to massively greater data re-use, with associated societal benefits and economic growth potential, should lead the committee to recommend a rethink in government over the remaining closed \ndata regimes. \nWe would also welcome an endorsement by the committee \nfor\n more open policy making in this area so that, at the very least, closed data decisions are as openly\n and transparently\n \njustified as\n is the case for open data.\n We would hope that\n,\n in t\nhe light of such transparency, open data would prevail more often.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-data-white-paper-unleashing-the-potential\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/shakespeare-review-of-public-sector-information\n \nhttp://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/nif-and-open-data.pdf\n \nhttp://www.iahub.net/docs/1377773673189.pd\n \nhttp://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/ifts.htm\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/state-aid\n"
