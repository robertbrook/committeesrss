[normal]Re Paragraph 8[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]This van passed so close to me I felt the draft and is now passing this tandem with a young child on the back. This totally ignores the Highway Code rule to give cyclists plenty of room in case they need to avoid a dangerous road surface.
[normal]Re Paragraph 8[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]This van is less than two feet from the cyclist’s rear wheel and went on to drive past causing the cyclist to swerve left.
[normal]Re Paragraph[bold] 9[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]If I hadn’t slowed down I would be near the rear wheel of that bus.
[normal]Re Paragraph[bold] 10[bold]&#xa0;[bold]This car has just passed me and turned left across my path. As I had been watching its erratic course in my mirror it didn’t take me by surprise.
[normal]Re Paragraph[bold] 12[bold]This is a bit far away but the movie clearly shows the cyclist swerve right to avoid the taxi as it pulled out of the side road.
[normal]Re Paragraph[bold] 14[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Overtaking into a blind bend. Again a bit far away but the van and the oncoming car both had to jam their brakes on to avoid a collision. But it might have swerved left and hit the cyclists. The movie clip went to the police and the driver received a section 59 warning.
[normal]Re Paragraph[bold] 14[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]I had just passed a line of parked cars. Now this articulated truck is grinding through the gears as it accelerates to pass me before the narrowing at the pedestrian refuge. I have to slow down as I have no idea how far over it will come.
[normal]Re Paragraph[bold] 15[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]I have had my hand out since this car was more than 75 metres behind me but he blasts past as I am lining up to turn into the road at the end of the black railings. Unfortunately the rain on my camera lens meant the number plate was not legible.
