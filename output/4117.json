"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Madhav Khandekar (IPC0019)&#xa0;General Comments: &#xa0;The latest release \n(AR5) \nof climate change assessment by \nthe UN Cl\nimate Change Body IPCC\n \nhas once again stirred the ‘\nglobal warming-human-CO\n2\n-extreme weather’ \ndebate and \nthe \nclimate science community at large appears to be sharply divided about the role of\n atmospheric CO\n2\n on the earth’s climate and possible future adverse impact of changing climate on world humanity. \nMany articles\n, since the release of the IPCC SPM (Summary for Policymakers), have appeared\n \nin various media, \nsupporting the IP\nCC view of the climate\n that “\near\nth’s climate is warming and there is an urgent n\need to curb human-CO\n2\n emission!”\n Several prominent climate scientists and skeptics of the IPCC science have expressed disappointment over IPCC latest release lamenting the fact that “IPCC has NOT provided ade\nquate explanation re: the pause in warming of the climate for past 16 years (and continuing!)\n”\n. \nIn a scat\nhing article, Ms Judith Curry (\na respected atmospheric scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology Atlanta USA) wrote: “\nKill the IPCC! After years and billions (of dollars), IPCC has failed to document a link between human-CO2\n emission and warming of the earth’s climate!”&#xa0;As this bitter debate continues unabated, it is important to closely look at the reality of climate change as revealed by observ\nations. Among some of t\nhe \nrealities of climate change are:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nClimate of the Twentieth Century:Before we consid\ner several other issues on the present climate change debate, it is important to look at the earth’s climate \nand growth of atmospheric CO\n2\n \nfor the twentieth century, for which best observational information is now available.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhen careful\nly analyzed, these observational lampposts\n suggest that “\nthe lin\nk between human-CO\n2\n emissions and climate warming remains\n questionable as ever!”\n&#xa0;\nIssues Re: IPCC AR5 SPM-Summary for Policymakers \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nConcluding Remarks:&#xa0;The latest release of the IPCC AR5 SPM leaves lot to be desired! The SPM claims linkage between warming of the earth’s climate of the last fifty years with increasing concentrations o\nf human-CO\n2\n, \nbut\n provides NO substantive evidence \nto support this claim\n!\n \n \nFurther the SPM \nhas \nfail\ne\nd to explain the hiatus in the warming for the last 16 years! \nFinally the SPM has totally ignored the reality of earth’s climate, which is that “The earth’s climate now appe\nars to be entering into a colder epoch!\n”\n With the approaching of the solar grand minima in the next decade or about, there is now a distinct possibility that the earth’s climate could see an onset of an \nIce Age type climate in the next two to three decades\n!\n--\nBrief Bio-data of Madhav Khandekar Madhav Khandekar \nwas born and brought\n up\n in central \nIndia\n and vividly recalls \nexperiencing max t\nemperatures of 110-115F (\n 43-46\nC) in the\n mid-1940s during the pre-monsoon month\ns\n of \nApril-\nMay. \nKhandekar \ngraduated \nwith an\n M Sc degree in Stat\nistics from \nPune\n \nUniversity\n (\nIndia\n) in 1957 and worked as a statistical assistant in the India Meteorological Department at Pune for about five years. \nKhandekar \njoined the Florida State University (USA) on a Fulbright Scholarshi\np and\n \ngraduated with an\n M S \n(1964) \nand \na \nPH.\nD.\n(1968)\n \nin Meteorology\n.\nKhandekar \nworked as a \nResearch Fellow\n with NRC (National Research Council\n, \nCanada\n)\n and later as a Research S\ncientist \nwith\n Environment Canada. \nKhandekar wrote a book “\nOperational Analysis\n &amp; Prediction of Ocean wind Waves’ \npublished by Springer-Verlag in 1989\n while at Environment Canada\n. \nKhandekar \ncontinues\n his\n research on various\n issues\n re; the present debate on global warming, climate change and f\nuture impact on world humanity since reti\nring from Environment Canada\nKhandekar’s latest report “The Global Warming-Extreme W\neather link: A review of the state of science\n’ has been published by the Global Warming Policy Foundation\n in the \nUK\n (GWPF Report \n11: ISBN: 978-0-9573880-1-7; published Nove\nmber 2013)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n"
