default1.1
default 
defaultThe Local Government Association (LGA) is the national voice of local government. We work with councils to support, promote and improve local government. 
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default 
defaultWe are a 
defaultpolitically-led, cross party organisation which works on behalf of councils to ensure local government has a strong, credible voice with national government. We aim to influence and set the political agenda on issues that matter to councils so that they ar
defaulte able to deliver local solutions to national problems.
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default 
defaultUniversal Credit presents an opportunity to provide a more seamless support offer to claimants that will enable them to become more motivated, resilient and self-reliant.  For this to be realised cou
defaultncils must have a lead role in commissioning local support services, and local partnerships must be at the heart of delivery.
default&#xa0;

default 
defaultCouncils are best placed to provide local support services

defaultowever help with meeting housing costs through advice and pastoral s
defaultupport will only take people so far. The Government is aiming to make projected savings of £11.8
default 
defaultb
defaultillio
defaultn in 2015/16
default. defaultIt is important to make sure that these savings are realised.  There is a need for there to be real changes to funding for affordable, appr
defaultopriately sized housing and local commissioning and delivery of support for skills, work readiness and employment. Without such changes, there is a significant danger
default of 
defaultrent arrears occurring. 
default&#xa0;default2.1
default 
defaultEarlier this year the 
defaultLGA
default commissioned the Cent
defaultre for Economic and Social Inclusion (CESI) to produce a piece of mapping and modelling research on the local impact of the welfare reforms.
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default 
defaultThe purpose of this research was to enable 
defaultthe LGA
default to have a better understanding, from t
defaulthe local government 
defaultperspective,
default of the cumulat
defaultive impact of all of the reforms.
default 
defaultI
defaultmportantly
default this included
default the scope for households to mitigate reductions in household income through a housing or employment route with appropriate support from local partners.
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default 
defaultBy far the most 
defaultsignificant and substantial outgoing for low income households is the cost of housing
default.
default 
defaultA significant
default risk to public service provision as a consequence of the welfare reforms comes from the potential for increased rent arrears.
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default 
defaultOur research shows that ther
defaulte is a significant gap between the amount of money being taken away from households through the cuts to 
defaultwelfare spending and the extent to which those households can mitigate their losses in the short to medium te
defaultrm by reducing their outgoings or
default increasin
defaultg their income by 
defaultfor example
default downsizing, entering employment or accessing other financial support.
default&#xa0;
default2.5
default 
defaultThere are three main rational responses for claimants to reductions in household income / increased housing costs:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.6
default 
defaultThis submission will explore both the
default 
defaultopportunities
default for
default,
default and feasibility of
default,
default each of these options, and how councils and their partners can support 
defaulttheir residents
default. It will also highlight the potential risks to households and service providers when these options are constrained and consider 
defaulthow these risks might be addressed.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default3.1
default 
defaultOur recent re
defaultsearch
default estimates that the income of households claiming benefit will be on average lower by 
default£1,615 a year
default default– or £31 a week – in 2015/16 as a result of welfare reforms. This exclu
defaultdes the impact of Universal Credit. 
defaultIt
default is equivalent to around £1 in every £7 of household income for these households.
default&#xa0;default3.2
default 
defaultA particular focus of the analysis that CESI carried out on behalf of the LGA was an understanding of the local impacts of reforms that
default are most likely to affect households’ ability to remain in or to afford housing – particularly in households where no one works.  The report focused on the local impacts of reforms affecting Housing Benefit, and specifically the impacts of:
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default3.3
default 
defaultThe report estimates that 1.18 million of these households (70 per cent of the total) will be household
defaults where no one works. Households are generally more likely to be impacted in the north than the south of the country.
default&#xa0;default3.4
default 
defaultImpacts 
defaultper household
default are significantly greater in southern England – reflecting the high costs of housing in these areas. The large
defaultst im
defaultpacts by far are in London.
default 
defaultI
defaultn every single London authority, the average i
defaultmpact is above £1,300 per year, 
defaultwhil
defaultst
default in just fourteen local authorities outside London the average impact is £1,300 or higher (all in the south east of England).
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default 
defaultLong term reduct
defaultions in the generosity of benefits paid to working households through changes to the tax credits system, reductions t
defaulto disability benefits and the 1 per cent
default uprating may have an impact on their ability to cope if rents continue to rise and wages continue 
defaultto stagnate.  
defaultOur report estimates that around three fifths (59 per cent) of all projected welfare reform savings fall on households where somebody works.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.1
default 
defaultThe research 
defaultmodelled a range of plausible responses to the 
defaultreforms, based on housing and employment data and recent research on behavioural responses to the reforms to date. In their relatively generous central scenario CESI estimated that 155,000 claimants, of the 1.18 million out of work, may mitiga
defaultte their loss
defaultes by finding work;
default and 115,000 by moving home.  So in total, they estimated that 270,000 claimants – 23 per cent of the total impacted – may be successful in taking steps to mitigate the impacts of reform. This leaves a significant number of households an
defaultd individuals needing additional interim and long-term support with managing their money.
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default 
defaultThe establishment of the local authority-led Universal Credit face-to-face pilots in autumn 2012 recognised the LGA’s shared understanding with DWP that many of those who are affected by the welfare reforms will continue to look to councils and the volunta
defaultry sector as their principal source of advice and support. 
defaultThe pilots are helping to identify the challenges that councils and partners will face and, most importantly, developing practical solutions that other councils can learn from.
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default

defaulthis kind of suppor
defaultt can only be commissioned and delivered effectively through local partners who have an understanding of the local area, existing relationships with individuals and families and, in the vast majority of areas, an established track record in working togethe
defaultr to meet complex or multiple needs.
default&#xa0;
defaultLewisham – Universal Credit face-to-face supportdefault&#xa0;
defaultLewisham developed an approach for working with vulnerable residents that integrated preparation for the benefit cap with preparation for U
defaultniversal 
defaultC
defaultredit
default.
default&#xa0;
default A pilot te
defaultam was set up comprising officers from the council’s housing benefit and housing needs teams and Jobcentre Plus to design and then deliver the service. 
default&#xa0;
defaultPhase 1defaultA letter is sent to the customer explaining the key welfare changes and providing them with an
default estimate of the financial loss of the benefit cap.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe customer is contacted for a triage assessment over the phone, which 
defaultfocuses on skills and experience across the financial, digital, housing and employment spheres. The script built into Lewisham’s CR
defaultM system assigns scores to the answers given by the customer, which determines if they are considered ‘vulnerable’ triggering the need for a further support appointment. 
default&#xa0;
defaultA face-to-face appointment is conducted, focusing on the financial impact of the ben
defaultefit cap and returning to work after the cap.
default&#xa0;
defaultAn individualised support plan is created with warm referrals to key agencies who will be responsible for providing on-going support tailored to the individual needs identified. 
default&#xa0;
defaultPhase 2 defaultLewisham are working
default with the Behavioural Insights Team from the Cabinet Office to develop a case management approach which will see the team offering some customers more on
default&#xad;
defaultgoing support.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe project governance established to oversee the pilot meets monthly and has represen
defaulttation from all key local authority departments, VCS leads, JobCentre Plus and Housing associations. Working groups have been established representing the same areas but at an operational level.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhen making referrals for clients as part of their support p
defaultlan the key partners the council has worked with are:
default&#xa0;
defaultfinancialdefault: Credit Union for budgeting accounts, CAB for debt/money management
default&#xa0;
defaultemploymentdefault: JCP (universal jobs match/ flexible support fund) and Lewisham’s Family Budget programme which is part of thei
defaultr Troubled Families initiative
default&#xa0;
defaulthousingdefault: referrals to Lewisham’s Housing Options Service
default&#xa0;
defaultdigitaldefault: customers are directed to where they can access the internet (local libraries and so on) and sites where they can access IT training. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is the council’s v
defaultiew that integrating housing and employment into local models is critical for the success of its approaches. Face-to-face triage makes it easier to identify those who are likely to need on-going support. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultCommunity Budgets defaultEssex, Greater Manchester, Wes
defaultt Cheshire and the London Tri-borough (Hammersmith &amp; Fulham, Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster) piloted a new approach to local public service transformation during 2012. In each of the four areas a range of partners, including NHS Trusts, the police,
default Jobcentre Plus, councils, the voluntary and private sectors and educational establishments worked together. The pilots demonstrated the benefits of aligning resources, reducing duplication and sharing information 
defaultthrough working together to break down pub
defaultlic, voluntary and independent sector boundaries and joining-up related, but disconnected delivery silos. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis model of collaborative leadership around the needs of a place is potentially very well-suited to helping customers affected by the welfare refo
defaultrms and commissioning local support services for Universal Credit.  The LGA is working closely with DWP and colleagues across local and national Government to ensure that the learning from Community Budgets is fed into the development and roll-out of Unive
defaultrsal Credit.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.1
default 
defaultResearch on responses to the reforms to date shows relatively little evidence of claimants moving to more affordable accommodation. This is largely because cheaper accommodation simply isn’t available in the places that people want 
defaultto live and, crucially, work.
default Poor or insecure housing can also prevent people from being reliable and motivated to work
default and councils are ideally placed to ensure that housing and employment support is joined-up around the needs of people and families.
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default 
defaultTh
defaulte only way to ensure the 
defaultG
defaultovernment’s benefit reforms work is to address the 
defaultsignificant 
defaultundersupply
default of affordable housing and to support a more flexible supply of smaller properties to meet demand. This means that councils need to be free to invest in new
default homes that meet this need.
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default 
defaultHousing need has never been met by the private sector alone. Local Authorities and Housing Associations have an important role to play to increase the availability of housing of the right size and at the right price to meet 
defaultdemand. However, as of June 2013 Housin
defaultg Associations had completed 25 per cent
default fewer pr
defaultoperties than in the previous twelve
default months
default.
default Councils’ ability to build is limited by centrally set borrowing caps meaning build rates are depressed below their potent
defaultial levels.

default borrowing cap could result in up to a further 60,000 homes over and above current plans. Overall 
defaultthe LGA 
defaultestimate that unlocking this potential to invest in housing would lead to a wider economic impact o
defaultf £20 billion
default.
default 
default 
defaultThe centrally set cap is distributed unevenly and bears little relation to overall housing need. This means some authorities have little or no borrowing headroom to invest in the smaller properties they need to meet demand.
default&#xa0;
default5.5
default 
defaultThe LGA will c
defaultontinue to press Government for to lift the borrowing cap and to trade borrowing headroom to allow greater investment in new affordable housing.
default&#xa0;
default5.6
default 
defaultCouncils are taking a range of approaches to use their existing stock more effectively and to incentivise peop
defaultle to move. All of those councils who are offering financial incentives to tenants to move into smaller 
defaulthomes have calculated that is will save them more in reduced rent arrears than it costs to pay the incentives.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultShropshire Council – supporting tenantsdefault through effective partnershipdefaultShropshire is one of the Housing Benefit Direct Payment Demonstration Projects.  The council has put a particular focus on working in partnership with the voluntary sector and has developed a financial inclusion board that in
defaultcludes housing associations, CAB, the Jobcentre Plus and other local support organisations to enable financial inclusion for tenants. Some of the services provided are signposting support, financial training and support for tenants, assistance with budgeti
defaultng to help them pay their rent, provision of banking facilities via credit unions and advice on basic bank accounts. Provision of case work and advocacy support is also available if required following a segmentation of residents in terms of capability. 
defaultTh
defaulte partners are evaluating tenants’ capability at a pre-tenancy stage as a way to sustain tenancies. Supporting tenants and identifying individuals requiring safeguarding of rent payments will be key to protecting landlords’ income streams. In Shropshire a 
defaulttrigger of 12 weeks is being tested before direct payment switches back to the landlord when the tenant hasn’t paid rent. Timely monitoring of rent arrears and intervention as well as signposting tenants to support as necessary are another key aspect of th
defaulteir work
default.
default5.7
default 
defaultDiscretionary Housing Paymentdefault&#xa0;
default5.7.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default£155 million has been made available to local authorities in Discretionary Housing Payments (DHPs) in 2013/14, to provide discretionary support to Housing Benefit claimants impacted by welfare reforms.  Our researc
defaulth suggested that even once plausible responses by tenants are taken into account DHPs would cover just £1 in every £7 of the impact of housing reforms on tenants.
default&#xa0;
default5.7.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthe allocation formula does not reflect 
defaultthe totality of housing impacts. This
default leads to some 
defaultareas facing larger impacts than others.  As a result there is wide variation in how f
defaultar DHPs will meet the ‘residual’
default losses in local areas, after mitigations are taken into account.
default&#xa0;
default5.7.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is the LGA’s view that 
defaultDHP
default should not be seen as the solution to lon
defaultg-term and intractable consequences of the reforms. The Government has presented the additional funding as transitional – in which case the problems it is being used to address should be possible to resolve over time, for example enabling people affected b
defaulty the size criteria to downsize into a smaller property. The LGA is conducting research into the use of DHP by local authorities and will use this as a basis for further discussions with the sector and DWP.
default&#xa0;

default 
defaultArrears, evictions and homelessnessdefault&#xa0;
default5.8.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs set out 
defaultabove our recent report estimated that 270,000 claimants – 23 per cent of the total impacted – may be successful in taking steps to mitigate the impacts of reform. This suggests a considerable likelihood that a significant proportion of those affected may 
defaultfall into arrears for the first time or exacerbate existing debt problems.
default&#xa0;
default5.8.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis is borne out in recent research by the National Housing Federation
default. In total
default 38 housing associations responded to their survey (of 51 contacted) who between them had 43,989 te
defaultnants overall affected by the Social Sector Size Criteria. 11,064 (25
default per cent
default) of these tenants went into arrears for the first time between 1 April and 30 June
default.
default&#xa0;
default5.8.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEvidence from the Direct Payment Demonstration Projects also shows arrears increasing under 
defaultmonthly payments to household despite intensive support from councils and housing partners.
default&#xa0;
default5.8.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMore work needs to be done to understand what level of arrears councils and housing providers can and should tolerate during the transition to Universal Credit, in
defaultcreased arrears will inevitably have an impact on the financial capacity of local authorities to invest in new and existing homes. 
default&#xa0;
default5.8.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCouncils are committed to preventing evictions and homelessness wherever possible, not least because of the financial and h
defaultuman costs of housing people in Temporary Accommodation. The LGA is working closely with councils, housing providers and the DWP to monitor the impact of the reforms on homelessness and to develop the right evidence base for new burdens funding.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default6.1
default 
defaultThe most desirable and sustainable way to support those affected by the reforms is, of course, to help them 
defaultinto work.
default 
defaultCouncils are
default 
defaultdriving local growth, and 
defaultprovide and/or commission services to
default help residents with more complex barriers to employment benefit from it.
default&#xa0;
default6.2
default 
defaultFar too many councils
default’
default are still reporting that J
defaultob 
defaultC
defaultentre 
defaultP
defaultlus (JCP)
default colleagues are unable to share information on clients and are 
defaultprevented from engaging
default with the complex needs of those most impacted by the welfare reforms. There is an opportunity in Universal Credit to make effective partnership working between councils and JCP the norm rather than the exception.
default&#xa0;
default6.3
default 
defaultThe pressure on JCP advisers to move peop
defaultle into employment as soon as possible disincentivises providing additional support to vulnerable claimants. The truth is, in developing an employment offer, the majority of JCP advisers, cannot confidently bring together a range of services in an area tha
defaultt an individual may need as part of their journey towards work, even if they are incentivised to do so.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Government needs to give councils and their partners in business more influence over work readiness and employment schemes.
default 
defaultCouncils’ wider economi
defaultc development role and local insight means that they can work with employers to forecast
default skills 
defaultthat will be 
defaultneeded
default in the future
default so 
defaultthat 
defaulteducation, further education and 
defaulttraining 
defaultprovision 
defaultproduce
defaults
default more people with skills that are closely matched to what 
defaultemployers in the area need. 
default 
default&#xa0;
default6.4
default 
defaultCouncils are also well placed to co-commission support given their relationship with local public agencies, in depth understanding and proximity to the client base and the services they are most likely to use, and links into 
defaultthe voluntary and community sector
default which can help to build confidence and skills profiles.
default&#xa0;
default6.5
default 
defaultThe outcome and financial benefits of local work and skills support models have been demonstrated in the Whole Place Community Budget Pilots. From these, Ernst and 
defaultYoung have projected annual savings of up to £1.7 billion, the majority of which would be found in DWP budgets.
default&#xa0;
default6.6
default 
defaultThe next letting of Work Programme contracts in 2016 is an ideal opportunity to line up the geography of delivery with the economic development
default actions of councils and their partners through Local Economic Partnerships. Councils should be the commissioners.
default&#xa0;
defaultOxford - Universal Credit face-to-face pilotdefault&#xa0;
defaultOxford identified some common barriers to people entering work, including: lack of child care;
default health issues preventing work; fear of the instability of entering work; lack of skills; debt.
default&#xa0;
defaultThey then tested their understanding of local need with a selection of customers affected by either the social sector size criteria or the housing benefit cap.
default Customer feedback confirmed that these common barriers were experienced by our customers and that most had multiple barriers. They also found that people generally were very keen to engage with the council in overcoming barriers to work. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe council is 
defaultworking with three organisations to support customers – Skills Training UK, JCP and CAB and is moving away from the traditional signposting model to one where the client is directly introduced to the organisation they are referred to. Counci
defaultl staff keep 
defaultin
default contact with the customer after they have received support to identify and responds to any further needs.
default&#xa0;
defaultBy July 2013 Oxford had engaged 180 customers and was working on an on-going basis with 26 of those, of which four had moved into work. A further 16
default cases had been referred to partner organisations - 14 as priority cases; 30 had received discretionary housing payments and all had received housing and/or work related advice. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe councils is also working with Thriving Families (Oxfordshire’s Troubled 
defaultFamilies programme) who are providing some intensive support to customers affected by the social sector size criteria and the housing benefit 
defaultcap. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default7.1
default 
defaultEven at the ‘high’ scenario in our research, which assumes both high levels of inclination and
default motivation in claimants and an optimistic analysis of local employment markets, the scope for households to mitigate reductions in income by moving house or getting a job is relatively limited. And at more plausible estimates, at least four out of every f
defaultive households are likely to need further assistance – with cumulative financial impacts in excess of £1 billion per year.
default&#xa0;
default7.2
default 
defaultCouncils and local partners are clearly best placed to provide advice and guidance at the local level that will enable people to mak
defaulte the best possible decisions for themselves and their families, and to provide targeted support to those who need it to become more stable, motivated or financially literate.  But there is a limit to the amount local partners can achieve while they are co
defaultnstrained by fundamental structural shortcomings in both housing and employment markets and a lack of real influence over jobs and development in their localities.
default&#xa0;
default7.3
default 
defaultThe LGA would like the Government to engage fully with local government on the key challeng
defaultes in their local areas; provide freedom to borrow and spend where there is a clear logic for doing so, and recognise within the design of Universal Credit that the complex barriers faced by some low income families to improving their circumstances are bes
defaultt understood and addressed by local partners at the local level.
